		<shortDescription>Well constructed mystery, fun and memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>April Fool's Day has just the right smarts about it that it holds up extremely well, even all these years later. While the cast may be youthful, the characters and story set this film way above "teen" slasher or horror flicks. Mainly, because this is really a mystery in the vein of Ten Little Indians. It's a good thing I saw this film in a theatre when it was first released in 1986 -- because the VHS cover has something on it that would have kept me AWAY if I had not seen the film already: "It's just what you'd expect from the producer who brought you Friday the 13th -- Parts Two, Three, Four, and Five." You just can't put April Fool's Day in the same category as those films! This is far superior in story and intelligence. It's clever, well-written, and has great characters that you like even if they are not so nice! These days it seems it's more important to find the most popular actors, and that is usually distracting and doesn't guarantee a good film. April Fool's Day had lesser known stars for that time (Deborah Foreman, Amy Steel, Clayton Rohner, Griffin O'Neal) and that worked as an advantage. The basic premise of a group of college students stuck on an island in a big house and one by one they disappear, yes, it's been done in many variations before. But the clever execution of the story, red herrings, and the underrated Deborah Foreman's delightful portrayal of Muffy/Buffy all make for a really fun viewing experience. Foreman has just the right amount of sweetness and can go right into being just plain quirky with such ease. The touch of having dolls on the dinner table, sort of like name tags, will bring a giggle and a smile for sure! One plus for this film is the fact that it didn't sink into the tiring T &amp; A route. Sure, a few of the characters have sex on the brain but their actions and dialogue never really wander off into the gratuitous area. Guys, if you really want lots of breasts than just go ahead and get some porn or a Playboy video, okay? Let the rest of us enjoy a good story once in a while! After the body count rises and things escalate into a tense and frenzied chase through the house, you'll be surprised at what happens next. April Fool's Day is one of the few films of this kind that actually had a very surprising reveal and I was even caught off guard, left with my jaw agape at what the whole deal was about. The BIG surprise just happens so...abruptly, that you feel just like the character that runs into the room -- just stuck for a second! After about 90 minutes of mystery, the payoff BETTER be good, and sure enough, this one doesn't disappoint! I'm especially thrilled to have picked up the eerie soundtrack by Charles Bernstein on vinyl when it first came out, and to this day love to give it a spin on the turntable. Paramount has a vast library of films that just NEED to be given great treatment on DVD, and I'm crossing my fingers that films like April Fool's Day, Let's Scare Jessica To Death, and Polanski's film The Tenant will be given their glory. &gt;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The underdog of 80s slasher films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>APRIL FOOL'S DAY has just recently gotten a sort of cult status among horror film fans. Casual horror viewers or those who are diehard gore hounds haven't been kind to this film, but it is quite possibly the most intelligent, best-acted, and coolest of all the 80s slasher films.A group of college friends venture to the island home of one of their classmates for the weekend and wind up being killed by an unknown assailant, believed to be the victim of a cruel practical joke played by one of the students. Amy Steel (my fave from FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 2) is Kit, the "last girl", and Ken Olandt is her boyfriend Rob. They are both very good and are believable, likable characters that the audience can root for. Other notable performances include Griffin O'Neal (son of Ryan), Thomas F. Wilson (Biff from BACK TO THE FUTURE), Deborah Foreman, who is very good in dual roles, Leah Pinsent (the classic good girl), Deborah Goodrich (too cool as the slut), and Clayton Rohner (the typical horny guy). I can't think of a bad thing to say about this movie except that some viewers will feel cheated by the two surprise endings, like I did at first. But appreciate the fact that they are totally unexpected and work better than any other ending thought up for the film.APRIL FOOL'S DAY is strongly recommended to serious horror film fans and even casual viewers. Not very gory, but that's a plus in this case. Notice the similarities to Agatha Christie's "Ten Little Indians", of which this is sort of a modern updating. A whole lots of fun and the best damn slasher film of the 80s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best minor-holiday horror out there.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the more fondly remembered horror entries of the '80's is this unique gem that's much more clever and amusing than the average slasher film.Young woman invites her beloved college friends to her island home for a weekend of fun, but everything goes wrong. A freak accident occurs, mysterious things appear in the guests rooms, our hostess starts acting strangely, and bodies are starting to pile up!With its clever combination of Agatha Christie-type mystery, teen horror film conventions, and quirky humor - it's not hard to understand why this film has developed a bit of a fan base. Even viewers who don't like horror films may find themselves enjoying this witty and twisted little venture. Director Walton does well in giving the film an air of mystery and spookiness. All the more adding to the atmosphere is the lovely music score of Charles Bernstein. The film is nicely shot in beautiful British Columbia.The true highlight of this film though is its above-average cast. While there are really no known actors in the cast, they all deliver great performances and bring their characters to a wonderfully likable light! Deborah Foreman, in probably her best performance, is great as hostess Muffy. Ken Olandt and Amy Steel are great as a couple trying to solve the mystery of it all. Clayton Rohner and Thomas F. Wilson are a joy as two joke-happy friends. Jay Baker, Leah Pinsent, and Deborah Goodrich are equally good in their supporting roles.As the tagliner says, April Fool's Day is certainly a 'cut' above the rest of its kind. It's a fun watch whether you enjoy the horror genre or not.*** 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, Different Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definitely not the typical slasher fare you might expect from the 1980s, April Fool's Day takes the ordinary slasher formula and spices it up - and in the process makes a much more palatable film than most of the films it initially imitates. A group of nubile teens(OK, not so different to begin with)go to their friend's remote island home somewhere in the Northwest. Here, they laugh, have sex, joke around because it is April Fool's Day, and, oh by the way did I mention, have sex. Although this part of the movie is pretty typical, it is well-shot compared to other films of its ilk and we do get some character development(not a lot) but some. Soon, people begin to die and things get serious. For a slasher film, this movie is very well-paced and, more importantly, is not over-the-top in blood and guts. The acting is uniformly average(something a Friday the 13th films craves!). What really takes this film beyond the mundane; however, is the stylish twist at the film's end. This, almost all by itself, allows this film to rise in the ranks. The ending is deftly done and does not look foolish or silly or forced; all of these things could have easily happened. So if you are up for some slasher fun, want to see some nice looking girls(Deborah Foreman and Deborah Goodrich), and are intrigued by a creative ending - April Fool's Day is for you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little something tasteful in an array of sour horror movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>April Fool's Day is really something special to me as a horror fan. In fact, most people I know have never even seen it or heard of it. But I have. And I love it.The casting is superb, delightful, and entertaining. The plot is mysterious, the acting is average, and jokes, accusations, and decapitations (real or not?) galore in this one-hour and twenty minute uninspired horror movie. There is even a scene in the end that unravels everything that you believed the movie to be in the first place. Amy Steel (from Friday The 13th 2) stars in this homage to crafty horror films, alongside the charming, sexy Deborah Foreman (Waxwork). It is really good to see at any time, and nothing about it should disappoint you. It is not your average horror movie. It's really more funnier than scary.April Fool's Day provided horror fans something a little more tasteful than was expected back in mid-80's. It's nice to have a mystery every now and then, and this movie will have you wondering what's up the sleeves of each character. True, it's not The Green Mile or The Shawshank Redemption, but it is truly underrated as a horror film.It's great. Nine stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>horror film with a twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we have your usual assembly of would be slasher victims along with the spooky old house near the shore bit. But the noticable difference here is the amount of laughs injected into this that you dont see in 80s horror. And an ending never seen in any other typical slasher film. The cast is perfect; a wise cracking bunch constantly pulling gags on each other. Wilson (far from his "Biff" character he played in Back to the Future) is great, Foreman is spooky as the weirdo hostess, Baker as the stuck on himself southern guy, and Goodrich as the outspoken cutie, to name a few. Most have wavered about the ending; some say good, some say stupid, so just be prepared for something different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>criminally underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my favourite movies of all time. Saw it again last night for the umpteenth time last night (but on DVD for the first time)and it's still wonderful. Funny, scary and seriously smart - the "twist" is great and works well even on multiple viewings - there's no cheating here, it works well even when you know it and can see it coming. I love it to bits, and it's tremendous fun. Criminally underrated. The cast is terrific, especially Deborah Foreman, and it's the first thing other than the Back to the Future movies that I've seen Thomas F Wilson in! And he's funny and likable in it too. Gorehounds needn't bother, but if you like a good story and a good mystery you'll have a ball. It's quite possibly the only slasher movie that will appeal to people who hate slasher movies! I adore it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated gem from the 80s slasher cycle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a formula is worn out people tend to lose interest. If you use it without something new to say then why bother right? You could apply this to slasher films, many of which are cliché and predictable. There are some exceptions. If a film that's like so many others has talented people involved in front of and behind the camera then it might rise above that. Fortunately there are some filmmakers out there who don't want to lose their audience and try to keep things fresh and exciting with each project. After you've seen so many slasher films what else can they really do with the concept? By 1986 the number of these films made was overwhelming, but of course there were diamonds in the rough. Paramount, the home of the hit 'Friday the 13th' series is also responsible for a forgotten (Not by horror fans) film that would surprise those tired of the same old, same old.Pros: Performances are good all around. A good fresh spin on the slasher genre. Plus the writing is quite good. A great sense of humor. A nice job done on the score, which is eerie. Beautiful shooting location and photography. Some good creepy sequences. Fast paced. Director Fred Walton and writer Danilo Bach do a fine job of keeping this from getting too predictable. Some nice surprises I wouldn't dream of giving away.Cons: Some of the characters are not too likable and can be irritating. Most of the kills are off screen.Final thoughts: Truly a breath of fresh air for the slasher sub-genre. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of 1980s slasher films I enjoy, good and bad, but so many lack anything new that hasn't already been seen in countless other films. A must see for genre buffs. I must warn you though, the 2008 remake is not at all worth seeing and will be no more than a waste of your time.My rating: 4.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>almost great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those "almost" movies. April Fool's Day has a very likable cast, a good plot and wonderful setting what is doesn't have is a lot of suspense and scares.It looks like a lot of time was put into this film to make it a classy horror picture. Perhaps that's the reason that none of the kills are very interesting, while there is some gore the death scenes themselves seem to have been edited out. Perhaps this was due to the print used on the DVD, maybe there's a better version...I don't know.The ending itself may put off hardcore horror fans but I found it quite amusing and it helped to make the rest of the movie gel together and answers some questions/concerns I had about about the movies story.Overall April Fool's Day is quite enjoyable. The young cast is a lot of fun to watch and a few notches above other 80's horror fare, the story is original and the local, a secluded beach house is quite nice. However, it could have been much, much creepier! With more suspense and good scares April Fool's Day could have rated higher. April Fool's Day rates a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best of the 80s teen/slasher films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>- The basic plot of April Fool's Day is similar to many of the teen horror/slasher movies of the 1980s. For the most part, the story of the first three quarters of the movie isn't really anything special. A group of eight friends travel to the island estate of Muffy St. John (Deborah Foreman) to spend the weekend. Soon, the inevitable happens - people start disappearing and bodies start piling up. Of course, there's no way off the island, the phone isn't working, and Muffy is acting very weird. But, just when you think you've got things figured out, the big ending comes out of nowhere.- About the ending (and I'm not going to give it away) - from what I've read, it seems to be a love it or hate it proposition. There's not much middle ground. You will either feel cheated and want to throw your remote at the television or you will love it and appreciate it as something different. Put me in the love it category. I think it is a nice change of pace from the normal horror movie from the period. There are a few (very few) clues as to what's coming up, but it takes a repeat viewing to pick them up.- Most of the 80s teen horror movies have interchangeable characters - there is a nerd, a jock, a slut, a good girl, etc. And even though the characters in April Fool's Day can be put in these categories, they are not as exaggerated as you find in most similar movies. The writers should be given credit for at least attempting to write somewhat "real" characters. By no means do we get in depth characterizations, but these characters are more like people I actually knew in the 80s.- As usual, I do have a couple problems with the movie. The biggest complaint I have is the idea that the whole scheme could be pulled off without anyone knowing or discovering what was going on. That notion requires an extra large leap in any sort of known logic. And, I have a problem making a jump that large.- By the way, what ever happened to Deborah Foreman? After the 80s, she seems to have dropped off the planet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now just who is the fool.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Student Muffy St. John whose family is incredibly wealthy decides to invite her college pals up to her parents' remote island home for a couple days getaway. The first day on the island is April fool's day, which means everyone is trying to outdo each other with pranks, but before they get to their destination one of there gags goes wrong when a person is rushed to hospital. When her friends reach her house they found items stashed away in their rooms and Muffy's behaviour has some friends worried. But what catches everyone's attention is that guest list is getting smaller and the pranks are no longer funny anymore with someone within the group making sure that no one leaves this getaway.You might think this is just another run-of-the-mill slasher that falls on a very notable day, but that's not entirely the case on this occasion. Well, yeah this holiday slasher sticks to the usual formula and clichés of teenagers being knocked off one by one by an unseen killer, but what sets it apart from it's sub-genre are some neat twists, a pinch of suspense, VERY likable and real characters and mostly, the unforgettable, original conclusion that totally throws you off track. The unusual plot plays out more like a compelling murder mystery with it being very similar in the vein of Agatha Christie's "10 Little Indians". Although, this one is quite light-hearted with a lot fun being thrown about with the constant "I got you" gags and a variety of ripe characters (stereotypical of course) who are believable in their actions, hold a perfect rapport with each other and provide enough effective humour. Sure they aren't fleshed out, but at least they aren't painful to watch and I never got tired of their shenanigans! Screenwriter Danilo Bach obviously brought over the bubbling energy from his earlier, witty script in 'Beverly Hills Cop' to this spirited project and the results here definitely show in the final product. While, the film might be kicking with such verve, some people might be disappointed (that's heavily) with the absence of flowing nudity (though, we are teased) and gracious gore. It's tame in that aspect with most of it happening off screen and we see only the aftermath of these murders with a little bit of blood chucked in. But you'll find out there's a reason why you don't see the murders. Since, there ain't no gore in sight they had to build up the intrigue by squeezing out some blinding suspense and jump scares to keep you amused. The first half-hour is filled with usual get to know you scenes as everyone gets acquainted with their surrounding and each other, while kidding around. Then it makes for stalk n slash phase where the setting of the isolated island comes to the foreground as now the impending doom fills every pocket of the screen. Maybe the atmosphere isn't that thick, but the essential sound effects are efficiently creaked out to add to the growing anxiety and the neurotic score chimes in with some spiralling, odd sounds that give out eerie and on edge vibe.Director Fred Walton manages to keep it all under wrap with some exhilarating suspense and sudden surprises, so that when we come up to the film's conclusion it does ruffle some feathers. Because the film is pretty short it does seem to fly by quick enough without much tedious spots that are usually associated with the sub-genre. Now the film's revelation is definitely ambitious risk because it's a make or break, and in my opinion I thought the pay off was rather nifty. Although, the tact on second ending, I thought it could've done without. The performances by the entire cast are more than adequate from the likes of Deborah Foreman, Amy Steel, Tom Heaton, Thomas F. Wilson, Deborah Goodrich, Ken Oldandt Jay Baker and Griffin O'Neal.This offbeat slasher that follows the conventional patterns, definitely has more merit and style behind it's novelty to simply entertain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember when I saw APRIL FOOL'S DAY for the first time (must have been around 13 or so) that it was a big disappointment and I felt really cheated in the end. At the time I was beginning to discover the horror genre and I preferred my horror-movies filled with monsters or at least a supernatural bad-ass that wouldn't die, running around slashing people up. I wasn't even a particular fan of the whole slasher-genre, so if you've seen it, you can understand why I was not happy with this flick.Now, many years later, I've almost seen 'em all in the slasher-genre (the good, the bad, and the really bad), so I thought: What the hell, let's see APRIL FOOL'S DAY again. And what do you know? I liked it way better than back in the days. Now, why's that?First of all, this movie knows what it's doing. Here we have a bunch of teenagers being invited by Muffy St. John to spend the weekend in a landhouse situated on an isolated island. As soon as they are installed, the movie follows all the rules of the slasher-genre by having a mysterious killer, which we never see, killing the teenagers off one by one (If you even think about having sex, you die. If you consume too much alcohol, you die...). Most of the time we don't see anything of the killings and the bodies just disappear with the sole purpose of being able to pop up later after the cast is dramatically cut down with two survivors running around trying to hide from the killer which they discover, by conveniently placed clues, is a close friend of them. So the movie plays it by the book, just so it could be able to present you that twist in the end.Though there are bound to be a few practical jokes in the movie, the atmosphere is more suspenseful than you'd expect with a subtle but moody soundtrack. And the actor's aren't all that bad, giving a more decent performance than you'd expect from a movie in this genre. All this keeps you interested and in the end it's not you, but the movie that gets what it wants. And that is: taking a pi$$ at you while laughing in your face.So this movie is especially intended for those who've seen just enough slasher-movies so they think they know what's gonna happen next. Those of you who seek blood &amp; gore need not watch this film 'cause there is none. The only thing we do get to see is a bit of rubbery make-up effects, some body-parts and a few decapitated heads. They are nicely presented to us, providing some scares, but they do look fake. Fake, I said...? Now how could that be...?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If points were given for endings, this would be a solid 10/10 every time. Shame that the rest of the film is so pedestrian that it nulls all the good work, and the end result is nine not very interesting people talking bullsh*t for a hour and a half before being bumped off one by one. This is done with the minimum of suspense, and your satisfaction at their demise is tempered by the fact you never see the victims harmed in any way. As I said, the conclusion is clever in a way but built around a foundation which is patently lacking, so you just wish it was tagged on to a better movie.

		<shortDescription>You just wasted 88 minutes of your life you'll never get back. Ha ha! April Fools!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This uniformly awful 80's slasher flick has garnered an inexplicably large cult following, so I revisit it every few years to see if I somehow missed the point the last few times I watched it. After this latest viewing, I'm pretty convinced that's not the case, and that this movie is exactly as bad as I've always suspected.The main draw of the film seems to be the gimmick that ties the whole thing together, but labeling this the absolute dumbest and least plausible twist ending in the history of horror seems like a woefully ineffectual understatement. I'm all for throwing something unexpected at the audience, but it has to work to be effective. The ending of April Fool's Day is not only faulty, it's pretty much insulting. Don't be surprised if you're actually angry when you see how this whole thing plays out, and good luck trying to make sense of the second "gotcha" ending that is tacked on after that.Stripped of the ludicrous twist, what we have here is a well-below-average dead teenager flick with a cast dominated by thoroughly unlikable characters. Since there's not even any scares of suspense to speak of (you can easily spot the "killer" on the DVD case, and during the movie they pretty much wear a sign on their head that says, "Yep, it's me"), the film becomes a tedious mess that leaves you hanging on only to see how the scenario is wrapped up. Unfortunately, as I've already stated, the ending does nothing to justify this film's very existence.Surely devotees to this genre have gotten used to accepting nonsense, but in addition to the ending, several plot elements here are so muddled and pointless that dozens of scenes seem to be in place only to pad the run time (I dare you to figure out how two of the disposable chuckleheads in our bunch pull off the knife to the stomach gag on the dock at the beginning of the film). In addition, though the movie starts out on April 1st, the majority of the action here unfolds the day after, which leaves our characters more accurately celebrating April Fool's Weekend. Thus, the big reveal comes about a day late by my estimation.The film-makers certainly had some money to work with, so the production values are higher than we're used to in slasher offerings. Likewise, they cast some decent actors in a few parts, so the dramatic end of things is handled adeptly. The only thing they didn't spend money on is a script that makes any sense.Of course, one of the big selling points in this genre is the splatter element. But in April Fool's Day, the series of rote and largely bloodless murders rather negates that aspect. The red sauce is so notably absent, in fact, that a misguided sex scene played purely for laughs seems to have been added for the sole purpose of garnering this film an R rating. Nothing else in this movie even skirts the boundaries of a PG-13. I'm not saying you need a huge body count or scores of spurting jugulars to make a decent horror film, but you need SOMETHING. This film certainly won't appeal to anyone who likes well-crafted stories or ably-executed scares, so the fact that the film-makers also made this film utterly unappealing for fans of the bloodier side of things is a perplexing approach that further makes me question exactly why this film ever got made and released.The only real piece of interest to be found here is the appearance of both Summer School's Ken Olandt and Amy Steel, who played our plucky heroine in Friday The 13th Part 2. Fans of 80's B-movies will likely enjoy seeing both of these faces pop up here, and they do a fine job of carrying the weaker actors in the ensemble. It's just a shame they wandered into such a wretched movie.I mean no disrespect to the scores of people who have fondness in their hearts for April Fool's Day, as I have plenty of cruddy films I hold in high esteem. But this is my review, and as far as I'm concerned, calling this movie "crap" is insulting to feces.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my favorite movies of all time is April Fool's Day. It is billed as a horror movie, particularly a slasher flick, where several characters disappear. As the story unfolds these characters that disappear turn up dead. But before all of these murders begin there are a series of practical jokes, some hilarious, some very inappropriate and hurtful.Muffy invites some friends from college to her families home for the weekend to have a good time. Things don't start off so well as the first mate of the ferry that brings the group to the island Muffy's house is on is injured in an accident after a practical joke. The first mate is whisked away to the nearest hospital and the vacationers continue on their way.At dinner more practical jokes are shared. Nan sits on a whoopee cushion. Archie sits in a chair that is rigged to have the back legs fold up and deposit the person on the ground as they do a back-flip. Later as everyone heads off to sleep other tricks are played. Hal is smoking a cigar and it eventually blows up. Archie again gets deposited on the floor after someone moved the trick chair into his room. One of the cruel jokes is played on Nan when someone played a recording of a baby crying in her room.It's after all these practical jokes that some of the characters start disappearing, starting with Skip. Someone attacks him from behind in the boathouse. And apparently kills him because the next we see of him is of his lifeless body floating under the boathouse freaking out the couple that was making out in the boathouse.The rest of the group, the men at least, decide to find out where Skip is or find out who is responsible. Nan confronts Muffy about the tape, alluding to some dark secret she has been carrying around inside. Archie is searching the woods when he hears some noise and steps into a trap hoisting him into the air and is attacked by a mysterious figure. Muffy begins to act strangely and progressively gets worse.Hal and Nikki head out to the well after they find out the pipes in the house are producing sludge. Hal drops the bucket in the well, and Nikki drops the flashlight. Nikki climbs down into the well where she falls in and finds the dismembered bodies of Arch, Skip and Nan after she falls into the water. Hal climbs into the well and rescues Nikki.Everyone is under the impression that Buck, the first mate of the ferry, is the culprit. After talking to the Sheriff they find out that Buck is still in the hospital. As they are securing the windows, Kit finds an old photograph of two children, she is startled by Muffy. The rest of the vacationers are starting to snap at each other.Rob and Kit go down to the dock to wait for the sheriff, leaving the rest in the house.

They enter Muffy's room to find Hal has been hung and they run.Arriving at the dock they call for the sheriff, but don't find him. They find the boat but no key. Rob and Kit find medical papers describing the mental state of a Ms. St. John; they realize that Muffy might not be who she says she is. Rob and Kit return to the house to get the keys for the boat. They climb in through the basement window and find a trail of blood leading to a furnace where they find Muffy's clothes inside. They see height measurements on a wall and the names Muffy and Buffy. They realize that Buffy is the one who was in the mental institute.They find Muffy's body. Buffy nails shut the basement window. Rob and Kit run up the stair looking for a weapon or a place to hide. Rob gets locked in a closet while Buffy chases Kit through the dining room and into the living room where Kit finds Hal, Skip, Nan, Chaz, Nikki, Arch and all the others mingling as if nothing has happened. Kit realizes that it has all been a joke. Buck reveals himself to Rob who freaks out. Buck releases the lock on the door and Rob comes running out to find out that the joke was on him and Kit.Muffy reveals that she will inherit the house and turn it into a bed and breakfast that specializes in one in a lifetime experiences. Everything was an elaborate joke designed to frighten and mystify. And Muffy succeeded.I love this movie. The acting was great, not forced. The plot was awesome, not telegraphed. I give this a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gathering (ten?) persons on an island is not that much original.One of the characters tells us so: "it's like Agatha Christie" when they enter the house .Except for the ending,maybe ,although the trick was used before (think "suspicion" "the stunt man" ) it is run of the mill Friday the thirteenth stuff .No character emerges and the actors' performance is mediocre.Only the well scene could at a pinch generate some thrills .That said ,the unexpected twist -and even the second unexpected twist- comes at the most awkward moment and anyway who cared for those guys and babes? Fred Walton did a better job with "when a stranger calls".Might have (or not )inspired Fincher's "the game".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie wasn't going to win any awards before it's crappy ending.It wasn't really a bad movie, it was just another typical 80s slasher flick. It's worth a watch if anything to see the cute chicks and the laughably 80s clothes.It had a couple of good, tense moments.But it's the ending that really bothers me.[SPOILERS AHEAD]On paper, this seems like a good idea. Have a typical teenage slasher movie, kill off all of the characters until two are left. Then, reveal the whole thing as a very elaborate hoax.But it just doesn't work. It makes you feel angry. Plus, if anyone made two people go through all of this trauma, the two people would either sue them, or skin them with a butter knife.I feel bad giving this movie a bad review, because objectively, it was pretty good. It's just that stupid trick ending. If I was the people they tricked, I'd rip out their lungs and eat them</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bottom-of-the-barrel bore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**possible spoiler**I think that "April Fool's Day" is one of the very first slasher films to openly make fun of its own subgenre, beating "Scream" by a full decade. Unfortunately, it is nowhere near as entertaining, although some horror fans would readily contest this statement. I would have liked to give the film a somewhat more positive review than this, but the fact of that matter is that it bored me. I didn't expect a whole lot, just an amusing hour and a half. What I got was--in my opinion--nearly devoid of thrills or surprises. It just felt dead in the water. The screenwriter, Danilo Bach, penned "Beverly Hills Cop," so you'd expect something much wittier than this--what's the deal here? It doesn't help that Fred Walton's direction is flat and completely uninspired, in TV-movie style (indeed, much of his career was spent on television projects, which one hopes fared better than this). Then again, he had little to work with. Whoever deserves the blame for this, the film is badly paced, wandering aimlessly in search of something with entertainment value. The only good part was the famed twist ending, which I will not reveal here. As I see it, this is the only part of the movie that really has any life in it (apart from a somewhat amusing videotaped sequence early on). The cast does what they can under the circumstances. Amy Steel makes a likable heroine who isn't let in on the big secret till the very end. As in "Friday the 13th, Part 2," she is a genuinely believable character--a girl in a slasher movie who isn't a dumb bimbo. That's not to say there isn't one in this movie--Deborah Goodrich plays the slut who doesn't even have the good sense to display more skin, a clear violation of the subgenre's rules. Ken Olandt is adequate as Steel's boyfriend. Deborah Foreman is pretty good actually--she helps the film mislead the viewer, making us jump to obvious conclusions. Thomas F. Wilson (best known as Biff in the "Back to the Future" series) has fun as a hormone-driven young man, though Jay Baker is annoying as the obligory jerk. I feel a little bad treating the movie in such a negative manner, but I'd feel even worse if I lied and said I enjoyed myself. Certainly it would be unreasonable to expect high art, but couldn't it be as least as fun as "Friday the 13th, Part VI: Jason Lives?" That film, released later that year by the same studio, rarely deviated from formula, but it always kept my attention and was never boring. Its creators had some fun with slasher conventions while also delivering some real thrills (I jumped at least once), overall being an entertaining junk movie. Some people may have felt the same way about "April Fool's Day," but I just didn't get anything out of it. The lack of gore or explicit nudity doesn't bother me that much, but the dull script did. Where is Wes Craven when you need him? The guy could have at least given it a little zest.* (out of ****)Released by Paramount Pictures</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I already knew the ending before i saw the film. But believe me, that's nothing to do with it, because i was wondering how they would explain what happened. the explanations were too little and too stupid, because they just weren't serious. the movie wants to create an horror climate but at the same time wants to be a comedy - it's a shame you only realize that at the end, i could have much more fun watching it.all the characters in the movie are quite shallow, there's almost no blood, the film can't build a good atmosphere, it just seems like the characters knew what the ending was all about. And then when it happens, the explanation is so dull and predictable, that lots of questions would come into your mind. You won't have good answers.It is a different approach to the slasher genre yes, the Agatha Christie references were very nice to see, but it's just a movie who can't built fear and it's a mess of character development. Characters will stay entirely the same as they began. I only recommend this if you already saw too much slashers and want to see why the ending was like that, but believe me, even with the surprise they could did so much better. I felt like someone said "i'm your friend" and then stole my wallet. just didn't work for me. go see classics like "black Christmas" or "halloween" instead for the 20th time. you'll have a better experience.</fullReview>

Nikki Brashares (Goodrich) is initially caught on videotape, pretending to be making a introduction of herself as a sweet and virtuous Catholic girl, ending with "I **** on the first date". The video camera is a way to introduce most of the characters of Muffy's friends. But en route to the island, a local deckhand is seriously injured in a gruesome accident.Then you find people started to get killed of one by one off screen and then Muffy soon find more of her dead friends body, then find out it all one big prank on her. I didn't care about this movie as I didn't not enjoy it at first at I saw it, it felt little boring to me and I would have gave it 3/10 now after seeing the the really bad remake I going to give this movie a 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>April Fool's Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of college students(..and well privileged products of wealth)are invited to stay at the island mansion of Muffy(Deborah Foreman)for April Fool's Day weekend with their rooms wired with gags. Various characters play pranks on each other, poke fun at each other's flaws, and various couples fool around. The pranks perhaps turn deadly, or so the plot possibly hints at, as characters suddenly begin to disappear. Perhaps this unfortunate turn of events stems from a possible accident on the ferry which brought the cast to the island where a crew member received a nasty gash wound on the side of his face after remaining in the water once he rescue dived for a practical joker. As each character vanishes from the plot, the remaining few, such as the obvious heroine Kit Graham(Amy Steel), try to figure out if it's possible Muffy is behind the terrifying shenanigans taking place.A spoof on the Friday the 13th formula still essentially follows the slasher design, just without on screen kills due to a novel twist at the end. I think it's stylish with a good cast. Walton does an admirable job keeping the film moving rather well without too many lulls. The film probably wouldn't be as memorable if not for the ending, though. Some sex humor and ingenious pranks pulled by characters to each other lends to the premise.I found the film rather amusing, but I can imagine quite a few slasher fans either hating this or rolling their eyes in disgust.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.By now you probably know that meat of this is quite ordinary. It has an `its all a joke` sort of scooby-doo ending. And this casts the whole thing retrospectively as a spoof of the genre. Not particularly interesting on that basis alone.But consider the beginning. When you stick close to a genre, often the only space you have to play is the beginning, including the titles. This beginning is great, sophisticated filmmaking.It features a film-within-the-film (a video) which turns out to be a joke. You have the dragging mannequins. You have the joke of the jack in the box, which sets up the final twist and also lets you know that this girl is not a twin and that she is a little strange.I was impressed. The rest is the result of an unpromising genre chummed out by weak production talent.If the denouement were as cleverly engineered, it would be a good film.One thing about this film is interesting. The girls are all attractive, and represent different high school stereotypes without resorting to the flapping boobs.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Slasher That Killed the Slasher Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Muffy St. John (Deborah Foreman), a preppy college student at Vassar, invites her friends over to her exclusive island resort in early April. What sounds like a fun weekend quickly turns sour when the friends begin to die in rather horrifying ways. Is it Muffy, one of the group, or is it someone else?While considered one of the more notable slasher flicks of the 1980s, "April Fools Day" just does not work for me on the same level that other slashers -- "Friday the 13th", "Hell Night" and "My Bloody Valentine", for example -- were able to. And I can sum up pretty much the key reason why: the end of the film. Not only is it a complete cop-out and a slap in the face to horror fans, but it is completely implausible. If you watch the film knowing the end, you will quickly see that the logistics are not very likely. According to HorrorHound magazine, this film has been called the slasher that killed the slasher film, and that is about right. If we place the slasher genre from roughly 1976-1986, this one brought up the rear. Only one good slasher after this comes to mind: "Intruder".The very last scene is the only really creepy part of the film, despite some attempts with decapitated heads, and even that gets the cop-out treatment. If this film had not been so readily available to kids scouring video store shelves in the early 1990s for horror tapes to watch, it would have faded away. Of course, the same can be said for the "Leprechaun" series.Now, I can say that the people involved are respectable: director Fred Walton also did "When A Stranger Calls", writer Danilo Bach wrote "Beverly Hills Cop", and actress Amy Steel was the star of "Friday the 13th Part II". Not to mention Thomas F. Wilson, who went on to star in "Back to the Future" and "Freaks and Geeks". So, yes, they have all had better projects. How much of that was brought out here... not sure. (It is mostly the story that fails... the directing and acting are fine, and there is some decent gore. And from all reports, it is at least better than the remake.) If you are looking to complete your collection of 1980s slasher films, you will need this one. And it is somewhat decent, to be fair. But my suggestion would be to hold off until a proper DVD release. To the best of my knowledge, only bare bones releases have come out so far, and this one might be superior if it came with the legendary alternate or extended endings (though as of October 2013, director Walton informs me that the footage probably no longer exists).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love or Hate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the front cover of April Fool's Day, I thought at the time it was awesome and I still love it It's clever, it's witty and it still works just as well today as it did back then. Just look at the DVD-art.April Fool's Day is of course another 80's Slasher, but with something different, which of course I mean the ending, which everyone will already probably know by now, when I first saw it I thought what a cheat I was really disappointed, but now I think differently, the ending is something different and quite original even by todays standards, and was copied in the awful 2005 horror flick "Cry Wolf".The gore factor is also a letdown as all deaths are off-screen but this movie was still entertaining. While this movie didn't contain much gore, it had some unforgettable moments of suspense and it was obviously a F13th rip-off but a pretty decent one at that and characters. Even though they're all stereotypical, I think that they were surprisingly sympathetic and it really did feel as if they were all friends which is an unusual thing to find in slasher flicks. It was a theatrical movie it had good production values as well. My fave character has to be, well I can't remember her name in this movie but "Amy Steel" a brilliant addition to the cast, a great heroine I loved her in "Friday The 13th part 2" and I also love her in this, it's such a shame that she never became a big star, but she will always be remembered as a terrific actress in my heart, she was always my fave lead heroine of all of the Jason movies, and yet again she plays the female lead in this which I was very happy with and again she was great.And finally the big reveal the ending which I thought was a major letdown, but at least they did something fun with it that no one expected.All in all "April Fool's Day" is a mediocre but entertaining slasher flick, starring the ever likable and wonderful Amy Steel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old school slasher fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah, where to begin with 'April Fools Day' ? undoubtedly one of the silliest 'slasher' films ever made (and that's saying something!). The usual bunch of overly s*xed and obnoxious teenagers go on Spring Break to one of their houses, conveniently situated on an island ? naturally with no escape (and, back in the eighties, they never had to make excuses for 'lack of cell phone coverage!'). Once there ? surprise surprise ? they start getting picked off one by one.Now, unlike other slasher films at the time, the killer is never seen (until the 'big reveal' at the end, obviously), making it like an early 'Scream' film and part 'who-done-it' as well as simple teen-chopping fun.If you're into your early slasher films then this one is worth a watch. There aren't any stars to speak of (are there ever?) unless you count an appearance from 'Biff' from the 'Back to the Future' films. Plus the death scenes aren't that well done (a bit of decent gore make-up here and there, but the obvious lack of budget does show sometimes). However, just because it isn't that gory (or well acted!) doesn't mean it's not fun.It kind of knows what it is (and what it's not ? i.e. High-brow) and plays to its strengths. Without going into anything that may spoil it, it's actually quite clever here and there with a few things that you might not see coming.Naturally, it has all the flaws of the genre, such as the nice girl surviving longest and anyone who has s*x dies first, but if you're generally a fan of slasher films you've long since learned to forgive such traits and should be able to enjoy it for what it is ? good, reasonably gory silly fun.</fullReview>

Normally I would of switched the movie of like this as I did in Batman V superman, however I was hooked on how weird it is and where it was going. April fools day is shot like a home movie and acted such with random dialogue that never made sense, its the kind of film you would show a B movie party. It's difficult to review April Fools day without giving out massive spoilers as the movie title kind of does that anyway. April fools Day is as we shall say a Guilty Pleasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's "Friday the 13th" Meets "Porky's"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The slasher boom of the early 1980's had more or less completely curdled by this point, but nobody had come up with anything to replace the long played-out template which had very little influence beyond initiating the replacement of tired stories about sexually neurotic psycho killers with tired stories about sexually neurotic psycho killer monsters. The film contains relatively little graphic gore, no actual nudity, and some pretty good actors, thereby going against the cookie-cutter recipe and, instead, concentrating on the development of likable characters, eerie atmosphere, and some genuinely effective spook-show scares. The plot is quite simple. A group of eight college friends (each more annoying than the next) gather together at an island mansion belonging to heiress Muffy St. John to celebrate their final year of school. They soon discover that each has a hidden secret from their past which is revealed, and soon after, they turn up dead. Yet, are they really dead? Or is it just part of some very real and cruel April Fool's jokes? The hostess, Muffy, is the only one who apparently knows what's going on. But then again, is it really her doing the killing? Fun from beginning to end.Director Fred Walton uses a funny, yet haunting script to create a slasher film with a twist. Nothing too special, for it stills holds very true with the genre, "April Fool's Day" will greatly satisfy fans of a film that combines humor and violence, while others purely dedicated to the slice-and-dice theme might be turned off. There is no argument that "April Fool's Day" was riding in on the wave of 80's slasher films, but that is where the similarity to other genre movies ends. You really have to think at this one. They really want to you ask yourself "is this all a joke?" and "could anyone have actually survived that?" I have to give some credit to the music for setting up some great tension. It adds to the feel without taking you out of the moment.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

Wilson (Back To The Future).The film is about a group of college students going to spend Spring Break at their friend Muffy's (Foreman) house on an island. What seems like a fun Spring Break soon turns scary as the friends start to disappear one by one. This movie is great at delivering suspense, and every actor plays their parts perfectly.

		<shortDescription>A very underrated horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it's a shame that this particular film wasn't well received overall by the horror fans especially by the slasher fans because this was a horror treat in the best possible way. There's something to be said when you create any type of movie that actually is an original piece especially with everything being out there it's very hard to come up with something fresh and clever all at the same time. With this jewel of a horror classic I believe that was the case where everything came together perfectly. I thought the characters were well thought out and interesting. The balance of the film was superb where the first half it was all fun and games and very funny then the second half it got serious to where the hammer falls on you and sucks you back in saying don't forget this is a horror movie which I thought was brilliant. This wasn't an all-star cast some of the biggest names were Amy Steel who was in Friday The 13th part 2 who by the way was amazing as well as in this film then you had Thomas F. Wilson that played Biff in Back To the Future who also was great in both of these films. Deborah Foreman who played the lead character in this film also played the lead role in Valley Girl opposite A young Nic Cage who was great in this role as well. Clayton Rohner, and Deborah Goodrich played in Just One Of The Guys together who both did their parts very well. Ken Olandt which didn't make a big splash yet as far as big time roles he was just starting out in his career and Griffin O' Neal same scenario in that he hadn't done a whole lot yet in his career when this came out. I have to tell you that there were some great performances by everybody in this film ones that were funny lines like Clayton Rohner as Chaz was telling Jay Baker's character Harvey who was excellent in this film as well confronting him about an earlier incident that happened in the film Chaz says to Harvey "You were jumping around like your ass was on fire. That was a very funny line in the film as well as several others. There is this one scene in the film where all the friends are sitting at the table discussing what they were going to do with their lives after graduation I thought that Griffin O' Neal's character Skip should have been at the dinner table with them it would have made the scene that much better. I think that Griffin O' Neal did really well with his character and should have continue to act because personally I think he's a good actor. The last twenty minutes of the film will leave you on the edge of your seat just typing this out and thinking about it gives me goosebumps it was played out so brilliantly. You can laugh a little but it was very creepy and scary and well thought out. I think this holds well with the slasher genre it's just a fun, smart, suspenseful and scary movie period. At the end of the movie there is this wacky song on the soundtrack that's very out there. Some of the material could use some strengthening but overall pretty solid. One of the better horror movies in general. This could be very well in the top twenty in great horror movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing horror/comedy slasher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heading to a private island for spring break, a group of friends' planned weekend of fun and pranks is halted by a series of strange deaths among them and must find the killer before it's too late.This was quite the disappointing and overall overrated effort. What really turns this one of is the overall jokey nature of the film which really sticks out here by this one just constantly going for the jokes, insults and pranks here. Even the beginning with the knife set-up at the docks, it becomes obvious that nothing here should be taken seriously which is clearly the case once this one gets going. The shots of the group goofing off at dinner as everyone pulls a prank on somebody else, crack jokes and insults towards everyone furthers this and when everyone here goes off to bed having all sorts of cheesy, silly pranks pulled on everyone with exploding cigars, rigged doorknobs, lights that won't turn off and malfunctioning furniture all give this one such a comedic tone in here that it pushes the horror elements so far out of the time here that there's almost nothing in the first half that makes this read as a horror film. As very few of these incidents are even funny to begin with, it makes this even harder to feel for what's happening as the comedy that pushes the horror out of the film is really not as good as it thinks it is. On tops of everything else here, the twist in the finale renders almost the entire film irrelevant by being so obviously set-up to put that in motion to get there that it feels so much like a cheat it just furthers the lower marks for this one. There's a few good parts here scattered throughout these flaws, starting with the burgeoning mystery that unravels throughout the later half as the discovery of the new-clippings and different hidden sayings about the house are all perfect clues as to what's happening, and along with the different behavior tricks utilized here sell this mystery as much as the discovery of the bodies, which are quite decent at times. That also brings up the only other god part about this one in the finale chase through the house which has a lot of great points here as they go throughout the house. From the basement encounter which is pretty chilling following up the portrait gag from earlier and the kitchen break-in has some tense moments, there's a lot to like about the stalking overall here which ends this one nicely. Generally, that's all that really works with this one.Rated R: Violence, Graphic Language, drug use and a non-nudity sex scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film after reading great reviews on here. I am a fan of horror, but i prefer modern horror which is probably a reason i disliked this film. I found it boring and not in the least bit scary. I also got confused which character was who, making it difficult for me to follow the storyline. I skipped some parts since nothing seemed to be happening. i have to admit i already saw the ending on a review here so wasn't surprised, but i would have been otherwise. It seemed an OK ending i guess, but nothing that totally wow-ed me and i don't think it was very realistic for me. Overall i disliked the movie, which was disappointing, but probably since i am use to watching modern horrors (like insidious) so this failed to grab my attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The quality of this film can be summed up by the traditional answer to the statement, "your shoe's untied"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>April Fool's Day is really a byproduct of a period of time when horror was overcrowded with cheap imitators and unworthy ripoffs. Consumers and horror fans alike were alienated by an overblown market of horror films that were low-budget, spit into theaters nearly every weekend, and made on a shoestring budget. The ones that were able to garner enough recognition while in theaters were released to VHS and Betamax and wound up achieving a cult status, whilst the ones that failed to drum up any business in theaters were left to fade in complete obscurity, some not meriting a home video release until the dawn of DVD and others, to this day, never been released.April Fool's Day is interesting because its campiness and its tongue-in-cheek approach to the horror genre predates the wildly successful Scream franchise, yet comes years after other horror spoofs like Saturday the 14th and Student Bodies. Needless to say, however, it doesn't come close to being as successful as the aforementioned franchise mainly because it can't even conjure up half the wit that particular series had. The film concerns a group of faceless twentysomethings that venture out to their friend's large home for Spring Break in light of April Fool's Day. Their friend is a wealthy individual, who has gone through the trouble of setting up a series of goofy little pranks like whoopee cushions to lighten the mood. However, the pranks turn more and more sinister, as drug use is suggested in the home, before finally turning deadly, as the group of friends begin to wind up dead as they all try and outlast and play the game their host has set for them.The film was directed by Fred Walton, who churned out cheap eighties horror efforts like authors were churning out pulp novels in the 1960's and 1970's. Walton, who also directed the original When a Stranger Calls and its sequel, however, keeps things mostly sterile with April Fool's Day in a directorial sense, never adding any kind of zest or cinematic flair to the screen. He directs this film like a TV movie, with very basic, predictable camera angles and a limp aesthetic that fails to amuse or provoke, much like the film's throwaway characters.Yet, the campiness of the film is the downfall here; this is a film that can't decide whether its cheekiness wants to work in bringing a more comedic edge to the film or if it wants to be campy to give the presence of simply being an amateur production. The tonal unevenness here comes at how much of April Fool's Day is just one big joke on the audience, playing us for fools, as the title would suggest, but not in a fun, "whodunit" way, but a tired and tedious way. The suspense lacks on almost all fronts, other than generic eighties synthesizers letting us know when we should be frightened and when we should be unsettled, the music is thoroughly boring, effectively exuding no personality, and the characters are your generic souls who make improbable decisions that come to light once the ending rolls around.Give April Fool's Day credit for carrying out an ending I'm sure would never fly in mainstream cinema today. However, despite how interesting it is, it's also very impractical, even by the standards of an eighties slasher film. It'd be nice if the encompassing package of April Fool's Day was as intriguing as its ending, but it's simply another cash-in on the boom of a genre, lacking in personality and suspense and, in the end, being able to take as seriously as anything else on April 1st.Starring: Jay Baker, Deborah Foreman, Deborah Goodrich, Ken Olandt, and Griffin O'Neal. Directed by: Fred Walton.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of college buddies convene at a friends isolated abode and get killed off one by one?Great fun, Fred Walton, Frank Mancuso Jr. and Danilo Bach tap cheekily into the 1980s obsession with slasher films and produce a self aware horror movie of mighty dark comedy proportions. Quite often when film makers try to laugh as they bite the hand that feeds them they fall flat on their faces, not so here. OK! It's hardly genius film making but the makers instill their picture with interesting killings, twists and turns, and even an audacious narrative that would only be appreciated some years later. Horror movie conventions are adhered to with tongue stuck in bloody cheek, none more so than with an ending that will infuriate some, but conversely will bring on the chortles in others. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unpredictable little horror flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a pretty funny and unpredictable horror flick about a group of college students staying at a friend's remote island mansion during the April Fool's Day weekend and finding themselves falling victim to vicious crimes.The movie starts off very slow with the college kids just cracking each other up with cheesy, unfunny and crude sexual jokes while waiting for their ferry to taxi. But, the excitement slowly begins after they arrive at the mansion and the practical jokes and nefarious activities mount. This all leads to some suspense and thrills as the character leads investigate the mysterious events about the house, followed by the usual screams and thrills. The acting was cheesy at times but not bad for the most part, especially for lesser-known actors back in the day. The plot and story are well-written and unique in a way that is not like the usual, and sometimes predictable, slasher flicks. Red herrings and twists and turns in the plot will keep you engaged and the climax will be something that is unexpected.Overall, not a bad horror/slasher flick - definitely one of the more unique ones.Grade B-</fullReview>

Foreman (Valley Girl) plays Muffy, a college girl who invites her friends to her island house for the weekend. They run into some snags and begin playing jokes on each other until someone lurking about decides to play a deadly game of their own when each of them disappear one by one. Steel (Friday the 13th 2) plays Kit, Olandt (Summer School) plays Rob, Goodrich (Just One of the Guys) plays Nikki, O'Neal (son of Ryan) plays Muffy's brother, Skip, Rohner (Just One of the Guys) plays Chaz, Baker plays Harvey, Pinsent plays Nan and Wilson (Back to the Future) plays Arch. I enjoyed this film, the cast is great and Charles Bernstein's score is eerie. This is pretty good and horror/slasher fans should check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Practical jokes are known to amaze and amuse people. They add fun and entertainment to liven up a very dull party. April 1st is known to the world as "April Fool's Day". In this movie, you have 9 friends from college going out to Spring Break on a island mansion. As everyone is getting ready for the getaway, disaster strikes. First, the ferry hand has a mishap roping in to dock the ferry. At the mansion, the soon to be heir Muffy(Deborah Foreman) has set up the place with some jokes of her own. The guests get a few laughs in the beginning, but things get a little more intense. One by one, the guest disappear. They either go missing, or worse, dead. With no way to contact anyone on the main land, the survivors take action. Seeing all the severed head in a well, things get really scary. With the last couple left, they make their last efforts to survive. All of a sudden, everyone in the mansion are all right! What's going on? It turned out that some of the guests were part of the joke. "APRIL FOOL'S DAY!!!!" So there's no slasher in the film, the whole thing is a joke. Well if you are a "sorehead", I would not want you to see this film. Especially, if you can't take a joke. I was amused.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Muffy St. John (Deborah Forman) invites a group of college friends to her mansion on the island for the weekend. The ferry won't be returning until after the weekend. People are playing April Fool gags. However an accident with one of the Ferry's crew sets a bad tone. And then old stories haunt the guest as they get picked off one by one.It's a slasher movie on an island without a way to escape with a bunch of young people. It's also trying to copy the scary-date slasher movie concept like Halloween and Friday the 13th. They even got Amy Steel who survived Friday the 13th Part 2. The use of April Fool's as a jumping off point allows for that everything-is-a-joke idea. However it quickly becomes lame joke-arama. The violence is tame by comparison to others of its era, and is mostly restricted by the story's gimmick. In the end, the movie could never be truly violent or scary because of the gimmick.It has the feel of 'The Big Chill' but the writing isn't good enough. There are a couple of recognizable faces in the group. However none of them are outstanding in this slow moving story. This just doesn't have enough scary moments. It's a barely functional 80s horror. The ending provides the only interesting aspect to this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful,Underrated,Funny And Suspenseful Horror/Comedy Slasher Film From The 1980s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>April Fool's Day is a wonderful,funny and suspenseful Horror/Comedy Slasher film from the 1980s that's filled with fine direction,a great ensemble cast,a haunting score and memorable make-up effects that make April Fool's Day one of the most entertaining and memorable Horror/Slasher movies of the 1980s.April Fool's Day tells the story about a group of College students who have been invited by their friend Muffy(Deborah Foreman)to spend the weekend at a mansion on an island leading up to April Fool's Day. Unfortunately,someone is taking April Fool's Day too seriously and is trying to kill Muffy and her friends one by one and now Muffy and her friends are trying to find out who the killer is and survive April Fool's Day.Released in 1986,April Fool's Day is an entertaining and underrated Horror/Comedy Slasher film that while was a modest success at the Box Office divided Horror fans and Slasher fans when it came out as some Horror fans were expecting a typical holiday Slasher film and they got something different from the norm. Thankfully,over the years April Fool's Day has found an audience and Cult status among Horror fans and is consider one of the better Slasher films of the 1980s. April Fool's Day is a terrific Horror/Comedy in the highest order a movie that balances out great laughs and non-stop terror for 89 minutes. April Fool's Day has the typical Slasher movie set up:a bunch of young kids who go to a house in the woods(or in this case an island)and killings and creepy things start to happen but in April Fool's Day the set-up as well as the execution is done in an offbeat and tongue in cheek manner that fresh and weird. The Comedy and Humor in April Fool's Day is great because it's driven by the main characters and the way they act or the situations and interactions that they all have with each other which is at times quirky and over the top. The humor in AFD can almost be seen as a precursor to Scream(1996)and the Slasher films that came in the 1990s because the dialog and story was much more clever then most of the Slasher movies that came out at the time although AFD isn't always self aware. As a Horror movie AFD isn't really scary but it can be suspenseful and atmospheric because there are certain scenes that will have viewers on the edge of their seats and because AFD is more in the style of an Agatha Christie Mystery like Murder On the Orient Express or Ten Little Indians where the movie keeps you guessing and asking questions about who's doing the killing and when will it end. What's also great about AFD is that the kills and murders happen off screen and makes them more effective and intense and the less you see in the movie the more intense the film becomes. The Blood and gore in AFD is outstanding and well done but is very light in comparison to other Horror and Slashers movies of the time which I think gives the movie a light edge and makes AFD less serious. The main characters in AFD are wonderful and interesting because where in most Slasher movie where we are waiting for the characters to be killed we as the viewer like the characters in AFD and root for them to live because they are funny and are not always arrogant. I also think that April Fool's Day has one of the best casts I have seen in an 80s Horror movie or in an 80s movie in general because the film features Deborah Foreman(Valley Girl),Amy Steel(Friday The 13th Part 2),Thomas F. Wilson(Biff from Back To The Future Trilogy),Clayton Rohner and Deborah Goodwich(both from Just One Of The Guys)and Ken Olandt(Summer School). All of those actors were in well-known movies from the 1980s and this was a great young cast that stands alongside the cast of the Brat Pack movies. The ending of April Fool's Day is amazing and one of the best endings and twists of I have seen in a Horror film but if you're a Horror you are either going to love or hate the ending I happen to fall into the former category because the ending is very funny,daring and truly unexpected and I think the ending adds to the greatness and quality of April Fool's Day. A terrific ending.The cast is great. Deborah Foreman is excellent as Muffy,the hostess of the house. Amy Steel is terrific as Kit,the tough heroine of the film. Clayton Rohner is great and funny as Chaz,the guy with the camera. Thomas F. Wilson is wonderful and hilarious as Arch,a big talker. Deborah Goodrich is fantastic and sexy as Nikki,Chaz's crush. Ken Olandt is good as Rob,Kit's boyfriend. Jay Baker is funny as Harvey,a student with a preppy student. Griffin O'Neal(Skip,son of Ryan O'Neal)and Leah King Pinsent(Nan)give good performances as well.The direction by Fred Walton is great,with Walton sometimes moving the camera using nice angles and shots with outstanding composition. Wonderful direction,Walton.The score by Charles Bernstein is haunting,eerie and effective and fits in well with the suspenseful scenes. Powerful score,Bernstein. There is also a great song by Jerry Whitman(Too Bad You're Crazy)that is funny and quirky and the classic song Mama Told Me(Not To Come)by Three Dog Night. The Make-up effects by Reel EFX group is wonderful,bloody and realistic and work for the film. Great Make-up effects,Reel EFX.In final word,if you love Horror Films or 80s Slasher films,I highly suggest you see April Fool's Day,a wonderful,underrated and funny Horror/Comedy Slasher movie from the 1980's that you can watch again and again is a great time. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Young adult elimination derby film with a comedic ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eight college-age young adults travel to a friend's mansion on a remote island.The place is loaded with practical jokes: dirty water from the kitchen tap, turning off one light turns on another, a tap in a room sprays the user, S&amp;M gear in the chest of drawers, newspaper clippings left where they are meant to be found; that sort of thing.Of course, the ferry does not come everyday, and the cops are not easily available. It seems like three of them get killed early on, but then other evidence denies that. For example, Rob talks to the cops by phone, indicating Buck is dead. Cop replies, I'm looking at Buck, alive, right now, in the hospital. Inspires confidence, eh? Something is clearly wrong with the narrative, but the pacing gets rushed, and nobody seems to notice.The elimination derby continues, or is it just trickery?-----Scores------Cinematography: 6/10 As viewed on Netflix streaming, the visual quality was better than VHS quality, but not by much.Sound: 6/10 The dynamic range was way too large.Acting: 6/10 Mediocre. Some actors were fairly skilled, but others were downright poor.Screenplay: 5/10 Has a beginning, middle, and a sharp turn at the end. Those who enjoy practical jokes will probably like this one more than I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably has one of the worst endings I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well you get the idea of this slasher at first. Basically a few friends go on a trip to a remote house and they soon get picked off one by one. It is up to them to find out who it is and try to stop it. So the formula isn't anything new but this does have a few problems.Let me elaborate on why the ending just doesn't work. In the climax the 2 survivors are running away from the person who owns the house's psycho twin (I know just work with me here!) only to find EVERYBODY that we see in the movie just sitting around in the living room... So you know the people who died? April Fool. You know that hour and a half of a semi-decent movie? April Fool (and no you can't get it back). You know that psycho twin you found out about? April Fool. If you're going to do an ending people won't expect then please don't make it seem that the entire movie up until this point was a complete cheat.The ending is probably my biggest complaint with this movie. But there are a few others. The acting does get hammy in places and the lighting of some of the night scenes aren't really that great. It's not Monster A-Go Go or Night Of Horror bad because at least you can see what's going on.So if you enjoy whodunits and don't mind endings like the one I described above then you might enjoy this. Until the ending it wasn't actually that bad - just an average movie of it's kind. It is a movie that somewhat keeps you guessing but as I've said the ending is horrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dangerous twists follow a group of college-aged kids when they stay at an isolated beach house the weekend before graduation. I like this movie because i can give examples of my own life based on the main characters. Basically, i can see it possibly happening somewhere down the road. This movie is about the cluster hanging out, suddenly thinning out - presumably dead. There is betrayal and romance. There are thrills, unknown twins and childish pranks. Somehow, these eight different characters and bonus intruder must fight it out.The perky princess of the group is Muffy. She is a pretentious snob with a tiara and plenty of connections. She sets the bar high above anybody and everybody else. She will happily lie, cheat, steal and maybe even kill to get the praise and attention she truly believes she deserves. She is about to inherit the lovely, yet eerie house the characters are staying at. She uses her friends as guinea pigs and trusts the model code: Boys want her; girls want to be her. She greatly reminds me of a girl i have known since freshman year high school (im freshman year college now). Muffy is the twin sister of sociopath Buffy. Buffy is constantly sulking in the shadows and may have escaped from a mental asylum. She also reminds me of someone. The girl is a bit of a stalker, much like a boy (later in my review) in the movie. Muffy's best friend is Kit, the brains behind the outfit. She always thinks in advance, from what she will wear tomorrow to how her future husband's funeral will be planned. She is a nice girl who can own up to some dark thrills. Nikki hangs onto any gossip floating around, then goes in for the kill. She is very curious, awaiting the next big secret that could change someone's life forever. She tends to be pessimistic, but certain things catch her eye. Clara is a God-fearing angel. She can be quite gullible and she never breaks the rules - until now.Skip is a full-fledged attention-grabber. I can morph together and enthusiastic party-goer and a class clown from high school and find this guy. Everyone wants to be his pal and he wants all the attention he can seize. He falls in love with the popular girl. Expressing and confessing, his buddies remain clueless and focused on Skip's past experiences and misadventures. He will constantly surprise you. Upfront and personal, someone misleads him as a joke. This results in Skip's brutal possessiveness and hidden jealousy streak. In a fit of rage, he goes after Muffy. Arch is the exact opposite. He is a bellyacher, like a boy i know from church. Every morning, Arch endlessly mopes. He does not want to stand up for his beliefs or face his fears. He is your average wimp. Harvey is a tough-as-nails hick. He reminds me of a guy i know, only through stories broadcast by his girlfriend. Harvey comes from a working family and takes absolutely nothing - food, money, girls - from a silver platter. "Everything must be earned" is his motto. The final kid (as i've mentioned before) is a stalker. His name is Chaz. He is an ambushing, photo-taking, down-and-dirty prowler. He will follow until he receives a hot, new story. He is permanently ready for blackmail, embarrassment and/or pure vengeance.From destruction to revenge to psychotropic drugs, this eighties flick takes a murderous leap. These practical jokes are not as they seem. They easily transform into secretive, grisly battles between the closest of companions and unite unknown alliances with the completely worst of adversaries. I rate it seven out of ten stars. With cruel references to previous slasher flicks, you MUST watch the nine seniors in this paranoid thriller. It is guaranteed to deliver chills and reveal evil enigmas. Keep an eye out for 'April Fool's Day'! It's no joking matter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is really fun, right down to the ending song. This movie follows the 80's slasher flick tutorial. Eerie, sustained keys with long moments of wonder in a room full of shadows. The kill scenes were of typical violence with Styrofoam heads and corn syrup blood, but that's what makes these movies wonderful. The acting was fair and Amy Steel was great as the lead again (as in Friday the 13th 2). This film's location was good too. A mansion abutted to a bay surround in mountains. Giving a secluded feel, like no help is available. The film's characters weren't too annoying and cheesy jokes were abound. The plot was used and tired, but redeemed itself at the end. This movie is a classic among 80's horror fanatics and stands out to general movie lovers too. In the end. This movie is a typical 80's slasher with twists and turns as well as some pretty descent acting to boot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>April Fool's Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of college friends take a seemingly peaceful weekend trip to their pal Muffy's house on an island, however things get deadly in a hurry in 'April Fool's Day'. It all starts when the friends are on the ferry boat headed to the island. A couple of them decide to play a game, but it goes wrong and one of the boat crewmen gets injured. The group make their way to Muffy's large island home, and it isn't long before we see some of the character's being stalked and "picked off" by an unknown assailant. Eventually, it gets down to Kit and Rob to discover the murder mystery and save themselves from sure death...I enjoyed 'April Fool's Day' a lot. The twist at the end was actually not disappointing for me at all, I know it gets a lot of flack. I thought it worked well given the title of the film and how they explain it at the end. The acting was very good, it was great to see Amy Steel one of my favourite "final girl's" from the Friday the 13th series. She was great as the lead heroine Kit in this one. 'April Fool's Day' had great atmosphere to it, which made the film feel scary and gritty. You could feel the fear that the friends felt after discovering the first dead body. I highly recommend this. It's a late 80's slasher which isn't your typical slasher. It has the feel of it without the extreme gore, and a nice twist at the end to wrap it all up. Check it out. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fred Walton's "April Fool's Day" is a bit of an anomaly in the slasher genre: there's very little violence. But even so, it's pretty fun, as a bunch of friends gather at an old house for April Fool's weekend...and they start getting picked off. Who's the culprit? The movie does have a few of the things that we expect in a slasher flick (namely a sex scene), but I literally did not see the ending coming. I'd say that the best thing about the movie is the scenery: it's filmed off the coast of British Columbia, one of the most beautiful places on earth. The whole thing is worth seeing if you're into the genre, and maybe even if you aren't. Watch for Thomas F. Wilson (Biff in the "Back to the Future" franchise) in a supporting role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's something special, in 2013, about going back 26 years to the past 80s horror that brings a joy to a current and ridged heart. It's almost calming and yet unnerving, as this is when horror was horror.When I was a kid, my parents would take me to the Fry's Food &amp; Drug store (an Arizona-staple grocery store since before I can remember and still to this day) and while they shopped, I stayed glued to the VHS video rental department, most specifically, the horror section. I would spend hours just gazing at the foam-filled empty VHS covers at the movie selections, especially the rated-R, horror fare I wasn't allowed to see.One, in particular, was April Fool's Day. While, I don't remember the time or place I actually saw it, but dang, I loved it when I did. And I'll never forget the cover of the box, i.e. the poster with the woman hosting a dinner party, raising a glass, her hair braided as a noose and a butcher knife behind her back.Back then and I would estimate I was probably 14ish, I didn't just like the slasher horror aspect, but the creativity of the events surrounding the unofficial holiday of "April Fool's Day."Today, it was a joy to revisit a movie I haven't seen since I was a kid. It was pure 80s. From styles, to direction, to cinematography?all the way to the cat jumping from the darkness. Did it hold up? Sure. Even with the "secret" that the movie doesn't reveal to those who have not seen it, or?been spoiled by it.So, if you've never seen this movie, or heard any of the spoilers, please do not subject yourself to someone ruining it for you.For, there is a statue of limitations when it comes to films. Such as: Who was Luke's father in the original Star Wars fantasies? Or what was Rosebud? These kinds of spoilers, if not already known, easily can be told because the audience has already had enough time to watch the movie on their own. But, with April Fool's Day, even after 26 years, I implore you: do not let yourself be spoiled.(This all said, I will reveal my personal story at the end of this article, and like the warning above, I urge you not to read my final segment if you have not seen this.)The movie centers around some well-to-do young college aged kids spending a holiday on a remote island with a friend, or to some: sorta friend, and while gags are common as, it is April Fool's Day (and weekend,) the fun soon turns to tragedy. One-by-one, the cast gets hacked and it's an 80s mystery of whodunit and why. Oh and how?do you escape when there's no way off the island?Most of the movie was common 80s horror fare, down to the movie based around a calendar "holiday." Only this one cleverly switches things up with the motives and reasoning. Not to mention the humor; I found myself laughing out loud at a lot of the scenes and dialogue ? even today. Oh, and I wanna provide my love for the ending, but that would be too much a spoiler. Suffice to say, it's well worth sticking through to the ending.On a side note, and something I probably didn't pick up on when I was a kid: there was a lot of homoerotic behavior in this movie. Sure, the guys (and some scenes with girls) were just messing around with each other when they had been put into places where they would "be with" each other verses the "hot" girls around. To me, today, that is, they looked a little more comfortable hugging and kissing, than most guys I know in these modern times. And that was refreshing with this viewing: these guys weren't gay, they never crossed the line into homophobia and they could still have fun with each other.I digress. I don't care if this movie is dated per today's standards, it's still clever enough to hold up today and I highly recommend this to both newcomers to 1980s horror but also to those who love suspense. SEE IT!*** Extreme Spoilers ***DO NOT CONTINUE?if you have NOT seen this classic.After I had initially seen this movie, I wanted to see it again. This was a staple of my (and probably anyone's) youth: multiple viewings of the same ole films. Well, I convinced my dad to rent this, despite its obvious "horror" stigma and R-Rating, both of which, my parents were against. How did I talk him into it? I told him: "No one dies in this movie."He gave me a look like he didn't believe me. Who could blame him with the cover and whatever description he read on the back of the box? Nevertheless, with careful consideration and mild trust in his son, my father rented it so we could watch it together at home. (Yeah, if I wanted to see a Rated-R horror movie that he knew I was going to view, i.e. not a movie I snuck into see, or at a friend's house, we had to watch it together.)At any rate, his anger grew throughout the viewing as more and more people died. Knowing the "twist ending," I kept playing dumb while stating I thought I remembered differently. Finally, when the end came, and that was only about 90 minutes, his anger barely let up, despite the finale. I don't think he liked it, despite my ruse.Ironically, I remembered the final shot where someone actually did die. I was incorrect, but then again, we're talking 24-26 years ago. Age will help you forget the smallest of details??But, it didn't help me forget the quality time I had with my dad. Horror brings us together, people! Cheers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Title Says It All!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched this movie when I was 15 on cable. It's one of those classic Horror films that U don't see anymore, and that's why I think it is still great to watch even in the 21st century. To some it may be a disappointment at the ending but it is still an excellent film. It has a great cast, you will recognize, Amy Steel, from Friday the 13th part 2, and Ken Olant from V the Series. The plot is a good one, it begins with Muffy inviting her friends to her house for the weekend. When they arrive they don't know what they are in for, except a good time and of course some April Fool's jokes. It first starts off with a joke on the ferry that goes wrong and a person get hurt. Once the friends arrive they can't get over what happened on the way over from the mainland. As soon as everything is settled down, the group takes to there rooms, where weird and to some personal/stuff is found in there rooms. The next day is when all hell breaks loose friend go missing and get killed off. It's up to Kit, Amy Steel and Rob, Ken Oldant, to find out who the murderer is. The two team up find clues and start investigating. In the end the two find themselves back at Muffy's house for something they never imagined. All their friend are alive and well in the study at the end. It's all a hoax, Muffy gets her inheritance in a month, which is her mother's house. She needed to prove she could handle keeping it with all the expenses/taxes. She uses her friends as guinea pigs. She will be turning it into a Country Inn, but a who done it Country Inn and the paying customers will know what they are in for, unlike her friends.I loved this movie, it's still a great movie to watch every April Fool's day and I hope the ending doesn't keep you from seeing it. Think about it, April Fool's day, the title says it all.Kris L. CocKayne</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>English Murder Mystery Set-up with American Slasher!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this back when it came out. I loved the idea, the suspense and Amy Steel who is still my favorite of the "Friday the 13th" heroines(Part 2 for those out of the know.) This movie made me want to go to one of these Murder Mystery Weekends, though I'm sure it wouldn't be as exciting as the movie. A nice script with a good cast of people who aren't stars, but good actors. Gotta' love Biff from the "Back to the Future" movies playing a goofy jock. Deborah Foreman, who we know from "Valley Girl" and "Waxwork," is also great here as our hostess with the mostist. The music is awesome from Charles Bernstein who also did the score for the original "Nightmare on Elm Street"(really nice guy too.) This is a really fun experience as a movie and might be cool to check out in real life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film several years ago and was pleasantly surprised at how good the story is. It was made in the 80s so you can get a general idea of the quality. The acting is not bad and even stars "Biff" from Back to the Future. Great plot twist and needless to say I didn't see it coming. The extras are poor. I don't think you can do worse because, well, there are no extras. Maybe, I doubt it though, we'll see a SE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I LOVE THIS FLICK!!!! 1986 horror / who - did - it mystery , starring Deborah Foreman as Muffy and her twin sister Buffy. This movie is SO COOL. Totally different than any Ive ever seen before and Deborah Foreman was pretty big during the 80s - but this was a complete different role for her. So eerie and satisfying. 80s Cult. Wish I had it. If I see this one on my shopping journies - I will not think twice about snagging it right up. If you like mystery. If you like the 80s or if you're a Deborah Foreman fan , see this flick. There are other actors/actresses lesser known in this - and they are essential to the make up of this little masterpiece....ENJOY!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"April Fooooooool's"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I describe APRIL FOOL'S DAY as a mind twisting slasher. Released in 1986 this film stands out of a whole bunch of slashers from the decade; not because it's one of the bests, not because it has the level of gore expected by a fan of the genre (in fact it doesn't have real gore), AFD shines because of it's original and unexpected ending. That's all I can say.The film has the average plot of a slasher from the 80's... Some friends spend a weekend in an isolated mansion property of the rich girl from the group Buffy. One by one these teens start to disappear (You can say that they get killed).Kit (Amy Steel) discovers the dead body of one of her friends and suddenly finds that all of her friends are missing and presumed dead. Kit and her boyfriend are the only teens left in the mansion. After a series of events, Kit and her boyfriend discover that Muffy has a twin sister that escaped from a mental institution and that she has been living in the basement of the mansion for a long time. As they discover this terrorific event, they found the head of one of their friends; that's when Buffy (the evil twin sister) makes her appareance and chases the couple. he chasing leads to one of the most disturbing and unexpected endings in horror history. Good slasher! It will entertain all the slasher fans out there! Amy Steel delivers a solid performance, just as in Friday the 13th part 2. She proves that she's the slasher scream queen. The dark settings, and the score of the movie help to increase the tension. The last 15 minutes of the movie are some scary stuff. After the ending you'll feel something that I cannot describe; it's a mix of satisfaction, anger, and laughter. Recommended for slasher fans and people who'd like to experience a slasher rollercoaster.6/10 Watchable, quite interesting</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent B Movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best horror movies to come out of the '80s by far. Taking the somewhat familiar drive through a group of kids disappearing one by one in a house in the middle of nowhere could be just another movie you rent when you get REALLY bored. But April Fool's Day is a small step forward from those other flicks. You may have ACTUALLY seen some of these actors before. Familiar faces from movies such as Friday The 13th Part 2 and Back To The Future are here. The performances aren't amazing but good enough so that some good and funny characters come out of their performances. The makeup team does some nice work here, particularly during the ferry ride. Unlike many movies of its kind, this film flows nicely and seems to work at every turn. By this I am referring to the score, sound effects and camerawork mostly. The story is the "group of kids" are headed to their friend's guest house for the weekend on April Fool's Day. Everyone is playing pranks and they think someone is going too far. By telling you more than this, it would be ruined. The movie will not disappoint you as far as plot goes. The third act is surprisingly entertaining. It has more story and subplots than all the Friday The 13th movies put together. SMALL SPOILER HERE(DONT READ ON IF YOU DONT WANT TO BE SPOILED) but do you know another movie that has a death by stab in crotch?? Didnt think so. Check this movie out. I recommend it to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't be fooled by its unique approach to horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I begin this review, I must say that I don't think a great ending can save what is otherwise a mediocre film. If you think an ending can do this, don't even bother reading the rest of this review - go check out April Fool's Day now.Now that that's out of the way, let me explain why April Fool's Day is neither as good as you might have heard, or as bad as you might have heard. First, why it's not as good as you've heard. On its surface, April Fool's Day is a typical 80s slasher film. It has a good-looking middle age cast, some witty dialogue and a mysterious murderer. As the bodies pile up, more clues are revealed and the plot twists like a pretzel until the credits roll. However, there are a few things that make a horror film successful, and April Fool's Day misses the boat on most of them. The pace of this film is quite slow, stalk sequences are devoid of any suspense, and the kills are infrequent and unoriginal. But...This film is not as bad as you might have heard. The ending of this film is, in fact, quite good, and it makes April Fool's Day stand head and shoulders above the rest of its 80s slasher peers. The film is also quite funny thanks to some great dialogue (and some excellent physical comedy by way of Biff from Back to the Future fame), which helps create a genre-bending, horror/comedy experience for the viewer.Overall, April Fool's Day is an interesting little anomaly in the world of 80s horror, and not just because it leaves out the gratuitous gore and nudity.

What other movie can you remember that has all the Jason type atmosphere minus the gore and in the end pays off like this one?? Here is your answer 0!!! I have seen 100's of these types of movies and not one other where the entire cast is so likable and hilarious and you just hate to see each die and then, BAM! They are all alive again and it's party time!! Fabulous movie!! Even those who hate horror would love this one. The guy who plays Arch (same guy who is better known as Biff from Back to the Future) is a riot!! The movie is actually scary and has a very good plot going and then like I said it ends with everybody having a good time!! The best part is you the viewer have no idea you are being set up either!! 10*** STARS!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>~Spoiler~It's been a long time since I've seen April Fool's Day. I remember liking it quite a bit though. It falls into the great genre that is 80's cheese horror. This is one of Fred Walton's (who made one of the scariest sequences in film history with When a Stranger Calls) few horror flicks that wasn't made for television. The more I think about it, it's pretty predictable stuff really. As a kid I loved it though, of course I was more naive then. The ending may be considered a cop out by most, but I liked it. It's very fitting, especially considering the title. I mean, the title does say it all. All in all, it's entertaining and worth watching (especially for Clayton Rohner fans, wait, I could be the only one).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The same people that brought you Friday the 13th team up for another movie, since Friday the 13th is kicking up crap around this time! What do they hit? They don't hit oil like they did with the first two F13th's, but they don't hit manure either. This isn't that bad of a movie considering it is a slasher film. The only problem is that the ending is extremely predictable to anyone who pays attention in the movie, it just makes too much sense that this is the way that it's gonna end. The movie has many strong points in it: The suspense, the original ideas, and the location. All of these 3 aspects are what save this movie from falling, the suspense being the most important. What could have brought this movie down are the following: a little below average acting (save a few people), the lack of gore, and the predictability. But, luckily for the producers these elements didn't sink the movie. And a floater is like an endangered species in the slasher genre, so those of you on a quest for a decent slasher flick should consider this, chances are you won't be furious by the ending ; )</fullReview>

		<fullReview>APRIL FOOL'S DAY is one of the 500 million or so holiday-themed slasher films released in the '80s to cash in on the monster success of HALLOWEEN.It has a pretty basic set up: Half a dozen college kids are invited to a weekend retreat on a mysterious island by their ludicrously rich friend Muffy St. John. One by one they get killed off by an unseen killer (of course).The proceedings would all be pretty standard if it weren't for the fact that there is a notable lack of gore or suspense. Actually, this film takes more of an interest in its dull characters' romantic lives than it does in scare scenes, so much so it often comes across less as a horror flick and more as a crazed lost episode of "Days of Our Lives". Also worth mentioning is the film's infamous twist ending which caused it to tank at the box office because so many slasher fans felt it was a cop out. I can't say I disagree. Although APRIL FOOL'S DAY isn't terrible, there isn't anything to recommend it on, unless you really want to see a horror film next April 1st.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sleek, Original and Brilliant Slash...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fred Walton's original film, April Fool's Day is sheer brilliance! The film revolves around natural slasher clichés, but adds a large amount of originality and raunchy, obscene dialog. First, Walton's production adds a bit of insanity to every scene, and gets into the characters' heads. Walton uses everyday objects to manipulation and succeeds in the eerie scenes, such as the notorious "Well Scene" and the "Noose-snake scene". The characterization in the film is extraordinarily made compared to the rest of the films in the slasher-sub-genre. There are scenes that depict the aroma and the feeling of the fun and happiness of the typical, offbeat friends. The film's teenagers are very provocative and voluptuous. The whole cast is also very good-looking and you feel sorry for their demises (mostly). The plot is amazing and very original. However, it is very late from the slasher genre golden-age (1980-1982). April Fool's Day is a classic amongst the slasher sub-genre and deserves a watch and a hand for it's originality and it's gifted, intelligent logic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie stands out from the pack even today as a special treat for true fans of movies with twists. Those who watch movies just for the gore and violence will be disappointed, but those of us who have been around long enough have seen that the best movies don't rely on cheap trappings in order to shine years down the road. In the genre of horror/thriller whodunits, this is a fun and freaky vacation. Deborah Foreman especially shines in the lead and it perplexes me even today how she did not become a huge movie star. Still, check her out in other small gems like Waxworks(another fun horror-show) as well as My Chauffeur(she shows great comedic skills here), and of course Valley Girl with Nicholas Cage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nine students?each with a skeleton in their closet?are invited to spend their weekend at a swanky island retreat belonging to rich college pal, Buffy. Once there, the group begin to fall victim to an unseen killer.Given the title of this early 80s 'slasher', it should come as no surprise to find that the whole affair is ultimately revealed to be an elaborate practical joke: host Buffy, who intends to turn her mansion into a murder/mystery venue, is simply testing her plot on her friends. Contrived, implausible, and very silly (such a joke would require crackerjack timing, Oscar worthy acting, and top-notch make-up effects), and not nearly as clever as it likes to think it is, this finale can only be something of a disappointment to viewers who have just spent an hour and a half believing this to be a regular body-count/stalk 'n' slash movie.Still, even though the plot-twist cheats more than a little (nobody stops to notice that the severed heads are not very realistic, and that the victims are not actually dead), there is still a fair amount of enjoyment to be had from the film: if you watch April Fool's Day unaware of the surprise ending (not likely, now that you've read this far, but I did put a spoiler warning!), then several of the scenes are quite chilling; there are some fun moments featuring more traditional, light-hearted practical jokes; and a couple of the girls are rather tasty (Deborah Foreman, as Buffy, is cute, whilst Sarah Michelle Gellar lookalike Deborah Goodrich is pretty hot!).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>APRIL FOOL'S DAY is a tricky movie! When you start thinking it's boring and it has nothing else to offer, a trick is expecting you! Before watching it I had some hopes about this title, but when I start watching my hopes were getting down, because all I was seeing was just another typical teenage slasher done so many times before... But to get even worse it had no suspense, no gore, not even beautiful girls showing their tits! Until a very good trick appears near the end! It's a nice twist and it was good enough to compensate the rest of the movie, at least for me... I guess it's not very hard to deduce this final twist, I bet that many people weren't surprised by it but I was and that's why I enjoyed it so much: enough to turn my score to this movie from a 4/10 to a 6/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the title of the movie suggests, when Muffy St. John brings her friends over to stay at her island home, some pranks get played. Some of them are harmless, but others hit a bit too hard emotionally. But there's a killer on the loose who is killing them one-by-one, ending the fun and games.It is at this point where it seems to veer into a typical slasher movie, but it's not exactly that. For one, the acting is much better than usually seen. Deborah Foreman in particular steals the show as Muffy. It's rare in these movies that the characters are actually likable, but they are for the most part here. And some of the comedy here is actually funny, another thing that makes it better than the normal slasher fare. The mystery of just who is knocking off the friends is a solid part of the story as well. From other reviews, it seems that some didn't like the ending, but I really don't see why. It's very different than anything really seen in a horror movie, which is what I think makes it so great. I guess that's not what some people wanted, but if it had a typical slasher ending it wouldn't have been all that memorable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of the reviews for this movie are just totally outlandish. Like, "Best Slasher Movie Of The 80's." ...uh, not even close! This is a decent film, but nowhere near Friday the 13th, Halloween, The Burning, A Nightmare On Elm Street, or even Sleepaway Camp. I'll give it some credit for originality and pretty good acting, but at the same time, some of the dialog was quite lame.You have a group of college friends (most know each other, but a couple don't) who are invited by a mutual friend named Muffy to spend the night/weekend at her secluded island home. Well, as the title gives away, it's April Fool's day and so there are plenty of pranks being pulled most of the film (actually too many in my opinion). So as most slashers go, friends begin getting knocked off one at a time until the grand finale...If you like your slasher films with blood, guts, and grisly death scenes, then you may want to skip this one as it has very little, if any blood at all. It does work out a bit in its own little way without the use of blood, and it does keep you guessing as to who the "killer" is. But that's about as good as it gets. April Fool's Day is a mediocre slasher film at best and is good for at least one viewing, but it will leave most die-hard slasher fans disappointed because it is more like a murder mystery than it is a slasher. When most people think of "slasher" they are expecting something grisly, and April Fool's Day just doesn't deliver in that department. 6 out of 10. Not bad, but not great either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever And Memorable Slasher Mystery.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, I'm actually impressed. I went in seeing "April Fool's Day" with little expectations, I was assuming it was another run-of-the-mill '80s slasher film, but I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome and found it to be a pretty good movie. The plot goes like this: Muffy St. John invites all of her college friends to her parent's secluded summerhouse on an island for the April Fool's Day weekend. The friends are planning a weekend full of fun and relaxation. The summerhouse is rigged with all kinds of gags and jokes when they arrive on Friday, after a terrible accident on the ferry they took over to the island, where a workman was severely injured. The friends find it all fun and games, and Muffy, the hostess, laughs to their dismay. But the following day, Muffy begins acting very strange, and one by one, the guest list begins to descend, teens disappearing all over the place. Is Muffy up to these murders, or is something more sinister taking place?"April Fool's Day" goes down as one of the more underrated slasher movies of the 1980s, and deserves a much wider audience than it has received. The story itself is a very well-constructed mystery with a sense of isolation, reminding me of an Agatha Christie story. You have the typical assembly of teenagers to be picked off by a killer, but the fashion it's done in really makes it stand out of the crowd of the wide array of body count movies. The film's surprise ending caught me off guard completely, which is kind of surprising because now looking back, it was all pretty obvious. I guess I just never had that possibility cross my mind - I took the film completely seriously all the way up until the surprise was revealed, and it made the film even better than I'd thought it was before. The acting was all decent enough, and one recognizable face was Amy Steel from "Friday the 13th: Part 2". Deborah Foreman plays Muffy St. John, the head of the weekend party, and is also very good. There are a handful of memorable scenes and even a few laughs here and there, but the film mainly tries to keep focus on the darker side of it (the murders taking place essentially), while still remaining fairly lighthearted about the whole thing. There is little gore to speak of, but the reason for this is cleared up in the conclusion. Just don't expect a splatter fest, because it isn't at all. It's more of a who-dun-it mystery (with a twist) than anything.To sum things up, "April Fool's Day" is an excellent who-dun-it slasher movie, and is a notch above most of the horror films during it's time. Plus, the twist in the end made it all the better. Some people might disagree with me, but I was impressed, because this movie is far from your average splatter flick. Recommended for those who want to see a different kind of slasher film with a splendidly clever twist. 9/10.</fullReview>

I thought the movie would be prank a like and it turned out to be in a positive way.It's a movie that twist and turn the slasher genre in a another way and takes that genre in a whole another level. It's experimenting but it works. And the whole movie got this brilliant ending that end up to be one of these cult movies in horror. You'll laugh, get scared, and the time will fly when you see it. And when the movie is over, you want to see it again.See it and get fooled. I did!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"April Fool's Day" is the kind of movie that you either enjoy or hate. Die hard fans of the slasher sub-genre may get really angry with the movies' ending; others may take it as something fun; others may think about it as something original and not very common in the genre.I don't have a problem with it but I don't like it that much. The movie has some thrills (specially near the ending) and effective scary moments and that's what makes it watchable.There's no blood, explicit kills, but you got tension, mystery, and drama. When it's known that Buffy is (supposedly) the killer you totally freak out and get really interested in the movie. After the ending when the audience witnesses the joke; you can't help but laugh.Now, the movies of the genre are not meant to make you laugh; they're made to entertain. "April Fool's Day" does half of it's duty and entertains the audience in a cheesy way. To be honest, I was skeptical towards the half of the movie when there weren't blood murders or explicit kills. I asked myself "what's going on, it's a slasher flick?".Amy Steel as always delivers a good performance but Deborah Foreman shines every time she's on screen; she's extremely beautiful, cute, and knows how to act. I wonder why she didn't pursue her acting career. She's the main reason to watch the movie. Forget about the twisted ending, Ms. Foreman worths the watch alone."April Fool's Day" is an entertaining bloodless slasher that stands alone in the genre for being itself a joke. The movie tried something and it succeeded. That's the merit of the movie.6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only reason I really wanted to see this movie is because I heard that it starred Thomas F. Wilson, better known for his role in 'Back to The Future' as Biff Tannen. I thought he was hilarious in that classic sci-fi trilogy and was interested to see him in another movie. I ended up however, being so absorbed in this cool film that I completely forgot who he was. He plays 'Arch Cummings' in this film and his character is comical, "Hi my name is Mary O' Toole O' Reilly O' Shea...". He also keeps sitting on chairs that fold over and he goes flying backwards at great velocity, cool.The storyline is great, so are the cast and the twist at the end was very clever and well thought out. I also enjoyed this movie because Amy Steele as Kit (and not of the four wheel variety), better known for her role in the classic horror Friday the 13th stars in this. She is rather tasty and obviously made the movie better for me.A film with chills and spills and very weak chairs, I loved it!. Highly recommended.Rating, 7/10. Great.</fullReview>

One by one they begin dying. Or do they? Good acting by all. Recommended. The horror teeny bopper films should look at the 70's and 80's horror movies and take a few notes and quit churning out tiresome stupid crap like urban legend and the faculty etc etc. Rent April Fool's Day!

		<fullReview>I have every reason to hate this movie. I've hated horror films for less. From the title, one could safely deduct that the movie takes place on April Fool's Day and that the characters will be playing pranks on each other for the first thirty-minutes of the movie, and that real mayhem will start up and inevitably be mistaken for just another prank. Why not? It's not uncommon for a prankster to pop up in these films, and we're faced with that same moment of revelation where the other characters discover, "Oh no! It's not a joke! It's real!"It's to the point where you see the "prankster" pop up, and not only do we know that he dies, we also know how he dies. This predictability has made me hate the pranksters, especially the ones who pretend to be horribly mangled only to get up and say, "Ha! Gotcha!"I'm almost to the point where I can guess which minute during the running time his dark fate will fall.Enter April Fool's Day, an entire movie about one of my greatest horror-movie pet peeves. Worse yet - it also features an over-elaborate BS setup to get a group of teens to a remote location, isolated from anyone who could come to their aid. Hmm, sounds like another horror staple. The writers weren't working very hard, were they? And my personal favorite, "There's a killer on the island. We need to stick together!" and everyone agrees, "Yes, let's stick together in this very room! No one wanders off alone! Got that? We'll all stay?oh look, a dark creepy corridor! I wanna explore it all by myself!" It's amazing I did not hate this movie. Simply amazing.One key is the fact that April Fool's Day knows its source material, and, needless to say, follows said formula step-by-step. The other key is the fact April Fool's Day knows what it is and never takes itself too seriously (I mean, it has a character named "Muffy" for crying out loud). The third and final key is the fact that the humor in April Fool's Day is not so condescendingly retarded that it hurts the reputation of the entire slasher sub-genre a la F13 pt 6: Jason Lives.Now, while the tongue in cheek nature certainly saves it from an outright bashing, it doesn't earn it much praise either. Granted, I did get a kick out of Muffy's over-the-top-intentionally-suspicious character, the Scooby-Doo nature of the ending, and I do have to admit one of my all time favorite lines in a horror movie history is in this one (around the end climax) ? you'll know it when you hear it. Only a horror parody could get away with such an incredibly lame line. Those positive remarks aside, April Fool's Day doesn't really have anything else going for it.The rest of the characters belong to the uninspired slasher film stereotypes. Not much gore to speak of, and were there any on screen kills? The acting didn't truly stand out enough to really comment on, same goes for the cinematography, the music, and editing. They get the job done. I've seen better, and I've seen worse. I think this ultimately hurt my overall opinion of the movie ? while everything is (at least) on par with the average slasher, it could have done more. As I wrote in an earlier paragraph, April Fool's Day knows its source material, but I think it resonates a little too closely with said material for my tastes. I would like to have seen April Fool's Day take just one more step away from its source material for the sake of its comedic elements, because as it stands (with all the ammunition a black comedy would have against a slasher) it comes across as a number of missed opportunities.Still, I'll rank April Fool's Day above the typical slasher simply because it is intelligent enough a movie to recognize the ludicrousy its throwing at the audience. Like I said earlier, April Fool's Day knows what it's doing even if it isn't doing a phenomenal job at it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bunch of annoying college kids are invited to a party at a remote island by Muffy (Deborah Foreman). Everything seems to be going fine but, one by one, people start disappearing and Muffy begins acting VERY strange...Back in 1986 me and a friend went to see this expecting a gory (it's R rated) and stupid slasher film. That's not what we got. There's no blood, no gore, no graphic killings--nothing even remotely scary (although Amy Steel seeing a body floating under a floor is kind of spooky). Heck--there's no real nudity either! The closest you get is handsome, hunky Ken Olandt in his underwear and (briefly) baring his butt. This movie stresses character development and trying to figure out what happened to everybody else. The R rating is just for swearing and explicit sexual dialogue. As a drama and a mystery it works pretty well. The acting is good--especially by Foreman, Olandt, Steel and O'Neal--and they do have a likable cast. And there is a welcome sense of humor--but a pretty funny kind not a malicious or dark sense. The ending surprised me a little too. It's well-directed also and has a hilarious continuity error--at the beginning some people fall into the water, they're pulled out and their clothes are magically dry in the next shot!But it's NOT a horror film and that's what it was advertised as. I was more than a little upset by that fact back when I originally saw it. In fact, I HATED this film because of that. Seeing it now it's an OK mystery--but that first impression is hard to forget and I'm still angry over it. I can only give this a 5.</fullReview>

It's not funny enough to be considered a comedy. It's not gory or horrifying enough to be considered a horror movie (those who saw the movie know what I mean). The characters are flat and boring and a film like this needed fun, real characters in order for the whole surprise ending thingy to have been perceived as being worthwhile. Instead, the characters are just stock characters seen in every whodunit or slasher flick. Only Amy Steel, from FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 2, is worth mentioning.When the surprise ending happens (being familiar with horror films and I can figure out what will happen according to what they show and don't show, the surprise ending wasn't really surprising to me), I felt like I wasted my time on this gimmicky flick.A letdown.

		<fullReview>Before the likes of "Scream" and "Cabin In The Woods" turned slasher movie tropes on their heads, "April Fool's Day" -- a Trojan horse of sorts -- did just that, all while operating in a vein similar to the popular holiday-themed stalk n' slash flicks of the era like "My Bloody Valentine" and "New Year's Evil."Rich and slightly aloof Muffy (Deborah Foreman) invites a group of her friends to her private island for a weekend of good times. Incidentally, they also arrive on April Fool's Day, which means the line between goofing around and getting gutted is more than a little blurred, as a series of pranks turns into a deadly game of survival, with a little who-dunnit thrown in for good measure.Produced by Frank Mancuso Jr. -- who helped birth many of the "Friday The 13th" sequels -- "April Fool's Day" shares a bit of DNA with similar films of its era. But whereas the average slasher flick of the time opted for gore over story or tension, "April Fool's Day" keeps most of its violence off-screen and/or implied, giving the film its own look and feel. At times, it gives off a slight Hitchcock-ian vibe that suits it just fine. Among the cast, genre fans will be pleased to find Amy Steel of "Friday The 13th Pt. 2" fame as well as the indispensable Thomas F. Wilson (Biff from the "Back To The Future" films) leading the unusually likable group of victims. While "April Fool's Day" appears to be all-too familiar on the surface, it really is a unique experience unto itself. Don't be fooled by its somewhat tricky presentation; this one is a real treat indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An under appreciated, clever film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of college age friends, nine in all, get together for the weekend at a beautiful island retreat set to be inherited by one of them. Their good time is inevitably going to be spoiled by a mysterious killer, but are things really as they seem?I understand that some slasher fans tend to be disappointed with how this ultimately plays out, but how can we expect anything different from a movie with such a title? It's a nice change of pace for producer Frank Mancuso, Jr., who'd made his name being involved with the more straight faced "Friday the 13th" series. It brings humour and self awareness (without resorting to obvious jokes) to the standard slasher movie formula, and it's its playful approach to its mystery / horror story that makes it stand out. The screenplay is by Danilo Bach, who'd also helped bring us "Beverly Hills Cop", one of the all time great action comedies, and the director is Fred Walton, a man as under rated as his output; after all, he'd previously directed the nail biting favourite, "When a Stranger Calls". The island setting truly is just gorgeous (the movie was filmed on location in British Columbia); it's all wonderfully shot in Panavision.Now, those slasher fans who *need* lots of violence and nudity in what they watch are certainly advised to look elsewhere, but those who want to see an amiable send-up should find this a pleasant watch. Its suspense / stalking sequences are well done, and there are some good jolts; the scene in the well is just excellent, and the scene with the snake is a corker, although the filmmakers do unfortunately fall back on the classic shrieking / jumping cat for one jump scare.The reliable composer Charles Bernstein supplies a superb score, as well as a catchy, utterly goofy end credits tune, "Too Bad You're Crazy".The cast couldn't be more entertaining, with Thomas F. Wilson, a.k.a. Biff from "Back to the Future", a major cut up. Deborah Foreman is a delight, as is "Friday the 13th Part 2" heroine Amy Steel. Other cast members include Ken Olandt, Clayton Rohner, Jay Baker, Deborah Goodrich, Leah King Pinsent, and Griffin O'Neal.Incidentally, it's worth noting that this movie was originally intended to have another "final" act, which would have provided an interesting turn of events indeed.After checking out this amusing movie, it's recommended that one read up on it in the excellent non-fiction book "Going to Pieces" about the history of the slasher genre.This is one movie that deserves its props and needs a shout out a little more often.Followed by a remake 22 years later.Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>April Fool's Day tells the tale of Muffy St. John (the brilliant Deborah Foreman) who invites a group of her college friends to her family's isolated island mansion. When the ferryman is badly injured due to a prank that backfired right when they arrive at Muffy's, Skip, (Griffin O'Neal) takes it badly since it was his prank that backfired. When Skip goes missing, the crew fears that the fun and games have ended and that a murderer is in their midst.There isn't a shortage of suspects. The ferryman and his superior could be out seeking revenge while Muffy, a plucky, happy-go-lucky gal, seems to have changed overnight into a basketcase. She stalks around in hospital slippers and displays a general lack of social skills. Power couple Rob (Ken Olandt) and Kit (Amy Steel) begin their own investigation of the premises and learn that Muffy has a twin sister named Buffy. Could the twin have murdered Muffy and taken her place? Or does the title do the film justice and this is nothing more than an elaborate prank? STORY: $$$$$ (This is a well written screenplay with enough twists, jolts and laughs to sustain anyone's interest. Granted, we do have some carbon-copy characters like Deborah Goodrich's slutty Nikki and Thomas Wilson's wise-acre Arch, but other characters are given plenty of depth. Rob is distraught that he has been denied a spot at med school while Kit examines her obligations as his girlfriend. And Jay Baker's Harv is a unique character as is Leah Pinsent's closed-off Nan. Good writing all around).ACTING: $$$$ (The acting is generally strong all the way around. Deborah Foreman is terrific as Muffy/Buffy St. John. She transforms herself from the life of the party into an awkward nutcase. Thomas Wilson shines as Arch--quick with the one-liners and quite adept at physical comedy as well. Both Ken Olandt and Amy Steel are solid in their hero roles while Baker is marvelous as the social-climbing Harv. Clayton Rohner gives a strong performance as the libido-crazed Chaz and Leah Pinsent effectively portrays the depressed Nan).NUDITY: None. However, there is a sex scene between Rohner and Goodrich and some of the dialogue is a bit on the adult side).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fairly standard slasher fare, the rather obvious twist here - given the title of the damn film - being that the events take place over an April Fool's weekend. A young woman going by the improbably name of Muffy invites her friends to stay in the mansion she is inheriting and, yep, one by one they are dispatched by knife, rope and, bizarrely, boat. The question is - is it Muffy that's responsible, or is there a sinister family secret that only now is coming to light? Have a guess. Go on. By the numbers slasher fodder, then, with the usual mix of hateful jocks and sex addled bimbo's providing rather dubious pleasure as their worthless lives are extinguished. It's enjoyable, but nothing you haven't seen before. And, no doubt, the recent remake will be dreadful, though I'll probably still check it out at some point, damn fool that I am.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film seems to fit perfectly in that little patch of horror films that seemed to ooze endlessly out of the '80s after the release of 'Friday the 13th'.But certain elements enable it to be much more tolerant than those pieces of trash. In what resembles a Clue board game, characters arrive at a friend's island home for a little raunchy sex and practical jokes in mind for April Fool's Day. But, guess what, a bloodbath ensues and the remaining survivors are left to discover the killer among them.Sound familiar? Thought so. Points go to the actually average acting and partially intelligent script. The film also has little gore, something else that sets it apart.I won't give it away, but the ending is certainly a treat. For this type of material, the ending is very clever and original. In fact, it almost saves the rest of the movie...almost.Grade: D</fullReview>

I read 'April fool's day' by Jeff Rovin first and really enjoyed it, it was full of twists, nail-biting chapters and a humdinger of an ending. I then was thrilled to find there was also a film, I was a bit worried that the characters would not be as I had imagined them in my minds eye but that wasn't the case, everyone (more-or-less) did a spookily brilliant job. Only quibble I have is that the book has a different and probably more horrible ending...not to bag the film's ending though which made me jump out my seat.

		<fullReview>(**1/2 out of *****) Horny, young pranksters party and yuk it up at a deserted island mansion and are picked off, one by one, by an unseen assailant -- or so you think. I thought this was pretty good. Much like the "Scream" movies, it tries to be scary and funny (and occasionally succeeds), and has a twist ending I honestly did not see coming. Yes, it's a little unfair and very manipulative (one of those movies where the final twist depends on everything working too perfectly according to plan), but the entire movie kind of sets you up for it, and it is a variation from the standard '80s slasher, so I didn't have too much of a problem with it. The cast includes Deborah Foreman, Griffin O'Neal, Amy Steel (from "Friday the 13th, Part 2"), and Thomas F. Wilson (Bif from the "Back to the Future" movies).HIGHLIGHT: That final twist -- you can either feel cheated by it or just accept it and enjoy it.</fullReview>

The film was edited very wisely making certain scenes much more effective. A Grade A composer (Charles Bernstein) for a low budget film is surprising and Bernstein's score complements the film oh so nicely. Also pay attention to the art director's work especially for the scenes in the basement and the attic. Some actors were pretty lame while some others were pretty good.

		<shortDescription>Definitely a cult film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that's riddled with so many little problems that eventually it's overcome by them. First and foremost is it's scope. It wants to be a mystery, a comedy, a revenge flick and a slasher movie. It's too convoluted and muddled to be mysterious, it's too serious and flat to be funny and the revenge and slasher angle are there only because previous draft of the screenplay probably had it penned a slasher/revenge film. There's a scene early in the film (establishing the lame revenge angle) that's SO improbable that it opens up a big gaping plot hole that haunts the film right up to the last minute. Just think of how realistic "I Know What You Did Last Summer" would have been if right after the scene where the kids hit the guy with their car and dump the body in the river they would have been back at the fair partying and having fun; not to mention having the incident barely mentioned again throughout the film. This said, April Fool's Day is certainly watchable, though wince-inducing sometimes and half the fun is figuring out just how much inspiration this was for the newer "Scream" type films (Personally I think a LOT). The cast is certainly able and personable and unlike a lot of newer "hot young stars" they don't make you cringe too much. The director doesn't seem to know what he wants his film to be but he does manage to keep us interested to the very end. If you're a slasher movie junkie and haven't seen this one it'll be worth the rental price.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better then expected.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to see i was surprised after seeing this "horror movie". Going in i expected a "open up a can of teenagers, butcher them in creative ways" movie. And in a way, it is. But there were elements here you couldn't find in other movies in this genre. First of all, the acting, although not great, is above average. Which is positive enough. But the humor is not of the typical "not funny"type humor you see in movies like those in the Friday the 13th series. The type of humor here is the kind REAL people of this age have, and most of the time actually funny. It says enough that i was even a bit disappointed when the movie started turning serious. But when it turns serious, it really does. No wisecracks, no jokes. These people are really scared of all the strangeness going on. From there on it's discoveries, twists and turns, all leading up to a conclusion you wouldn't expect. At least not in advance. The horror in the movie offers nothing new, but the sense of humor, the surprises, and yes, the suspense, which is present, make this a better slasher movie than i expected it to be.By the way, there is another movie with the title "April fools day", which is exactly what i would expect, an uninspired unoriginal and terribly acted slasher movie.</fullReview>

The movie centers on a group of college kids who go to visit an island that their friend Muffy owns. Unfortunately, the tricks start to take on a more frightening tone, and only the hostess knows what's going on....or does she?This movie will have you guessing from beginning to end, and is not like other horror movies that were around during this time like "Friday the 13th" and "Nightmare On Elm Street".

		<fullReview>April Fool's Day (1986) ** (out of 4)Muffy invites eight of her friends out to her house deep in the woods, surrounded by water and soon all of them are getting picked off. Is it a boat captain the kids messed with earlier or is it Muffy's evil twin? Even though each year gave us at least a dozen slashers this one here has remained quite popular but controversial at the same time. The reason the film remains a hot topic isn't because of the gore scenes...because there aren't any. The performances, direction and art design aren't the reason people still discuss this movie either. The reason, and you can quit reading here if you haven't seen the movie, is because of the title and the fact that it plays a part in the twist at the end. The film didn't work for me the first time and it didn't improve any on this second viewing even though I was aware of what was happening the entire time. I think the filmmakers thought they were a lot more clever than they actually were and I'd go even further as to say the screenplay can't do enough justice for what they're even attempting to do. I think the biggest problem is that it's so obvious as to what's going on and this isn't helped because the red herring characters are so poorly thrown in our face that it's obvious as to who isn't doing the "killings". I think naming the film what they did was another mistake because thing might have worked a lot better had the ending been a secret and the movie didn't make it so obvious. Selling this movie off as a slasher is pretty much a cheat because we don't get any good gore scenes. Again, I know this is part of the joke but it still doesn't work for me. Even while watching the movie if you don't know what's going on you're eventually going to start asking yourself why you're watching a slasher and yet no slashing is going on. One good thing is that the film runs very quickly and the director keeps everything moving at a nice pace. Another plus is some nice humor as the teens start to find various objects to their pass in their rooms. In the end I've always seen this film as a wasted opportunity and I'm saying this knowing that there are fans out there. I've just never seen the charm in the film and this new viewing didn't help any.</fullReview>

The actors were great, many of them stand out including AMY STEEL (Friday THE 13TH PART 2) that guy who played BIFF in BACK TO THE FUTURE, KEN OLANDT (LEPRECHAUN) &amp; DEBORAH FOREMAN &amp; a slew of others. There's also plenty of mystery as we try to figure out who the killer may be &amp; a real neat twist ending. Sure it's another Friday THE 13TH rip-off, but it's a fun rip-off!

Of course not. It was a gag to see if Buffy's idea would work. No one really gets killed. I don't recommend this to many who are true horror fans. The ending could've been better. I know I'm not alone. No real gore, no real sex scenes, lots of swearing, little violence. I guess I can give it a little credit since it is a b-movie and it was made in the mid eighties. So for those who are thinking of seeing it (you shouldn't be reading this if you haven't yet)I would say don't if your a big horror fan, but if you want to see a unique horror movie, this is definitely it.</fullReview>

An easy target for the critics, who prefer to dissect films/books/etc rather than actually just watch and enjoy them, this would be accused of being somewhat formulaic. For me, whenever I see a movie, I watch as if it is the only film that I have ever seen, and judge it entirely on its own merits, rather than in comparison with anything else. To that end, I find April Fool's Day gripping, entertaining, and with one of the best unexpected endings that I have seen, it is worth its full 86 minutes!</fullReview>

One by one, they're getting slashed by an unknown killer?.Yes, everybody is pretty familiar with this plot-synopsis but don't categorize 'April Fool's Day' in the dull, pointless 80's horror section just yet! For some unexplainable reason this film is 10 times more bearable than the majority of other Friday the 13th imitations. The atmosphere of this film is very light-headed, it features several ingenious findings and minor plot-twists and there even is a bit of tension to detect in some sequences. Biggest pleasant surprise, however, are the characters in April fool's Day. The routine slasher-picture introduces a bunch of semi-retarded and colorless teenagers and you can't wait for them to die quick and painful! The protagonists in this film are likable young persons with attitude and character. It's like a small victory to witness this in a horror film. The abrupt climax-twist was okay to me, but it might disappoint hard-boiled horror fans. The film overall isn't that bloody or violent and the focus is merely on the atmosphere and sadist humor. In some ways, it reminded me of Mario Bava's 'Bay of Blood' and there are worse films to be compared with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>April Fool's Day starts as nine college friends all set out to spend the weekend on an isolated island belonging to Muffy (Deborah Foreman) whom they all know from school. The only way to the island is by ferry, while sailing there an accident happens &amp; a lad named Buck (Mike Nomad) is badly injured which puts a downer on the weekend. Once there they decide to make the best out of the situation &amp; the traditional April fool's day practical jokes occur from collapsible chairs, door knobs that come off in your hand &amp; whoopee cushions, each &amp; every one a classic. Then one-by-one the teens start to go missing &amp; even worse their dead bodies begin to turn up, a killer is on the loose...Directed by Fred Walton one has to say that I really didn't like April Fool's Day that much &amp; I'm usually very forgiving when it comes to mindless 80's teen slashers, one of teen slashers to use the gimmick of a holiday calender event along with the likes of Black Christmas (1974), Halloween (1978), Friday the 13th (1980), Mother's Day (1980), Prom Night (1980), My Bloody Valentine (1981) &amp; Happy Birthday to Me (1981) &amp; is in my opinion one of the least impressive examples. The script by Danilo Bach takes itself very seriously, has bland cardboard cutout teen character's whose names I can barely remember &amp; an inexcusable lack of blood or gore. To be honest April Fool's Day as a film lives or dies by it's absurd twist endings, personally I think it's one of those 'love it or hate it' type things &amp; speaking from a personal point of view I'm definitely leaning towards the later. The twist is so contrived, silly &amp; full of holes that I found it impossible to keep a straight face. Then after the main twist comes another groan inducing twist which is standard horror fare &amp; totally unnecessary rounds things off. The way I'll sum April Fool's Day up is in four parts, for the first half of the first half it's just annoying teens travelling to the island, then for the second half of the first half they play lots of practical April fool's day jokes on each other while the first half of the second half is nothing more than traditional teen 80's teen slasher fare (only worse) &amp; the second half of the second half is made up of two cheesy twists which for me didn't work at all.Director Walton films with a certain competency &amp; gloss in 2:35:1 widescreen but it's rather bland &amp; forgettable, I'd struggle to say there's any style here at any rate. The lack of blood, gore or violence is most unappealing &amp; basically sinks the film without trace as far as I'm concerned. There are a couple of decapitated heads &amp; some blood splashes otherwise absolutely nothing. All the 'murders' are very much off screen &amp; since it turns out that not one person does actually die in April Fool's Day it probably has the unwelcome distinction of being the only teen slasher ever made without a single death in it. There's no nudity either.I was amazed to see that the IMDb says this had a budget of $5,000,000 because virtually nothing happens, there's no big name actor's, there's no special effects &amp; while it looks nice &amp; glossy is that enough to show for five big ones? Shot on location in British Columbia in Canada. The acting is so-so, it's alright by 80's slasher standards but no-one is going to win any awards.April Fool's Day is average at best &amp; even then only if you buy the ridiculous twist endings, it's well made &amp; it's down to opinion but it didn't really do anything for me. I like 80's slashers so I didn't regret watching April Fool's Day &amp; slasher fans will probably like it to some extent but overall I've seen much better examples. Another slasher film was made the same year under the title April Fool's Day but was released as Slaughter High (1986) while in keeping with recent Hollywood trends they have given someone three times the budget of the original to remake it as April Fool's Day (2008), I wonder if they will change that twist ending...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stupid, boring film finds a group of stupid, annoying teenagers journying to an island. It seems they were invited there by Muffy St. John (a very annoying character). Every character is annoying, ridiculus, and stupid. The movie's boring until the ending (the only good thing about the film). Amy Steel basically repeats her Friday The 13th Part 2 routine and Claythong Rohner is even worse here than he was in Sometimes They Come Back For More. An extremely dull film, unwisely given a wide theatrical release by Paramount. Alternately dull or annoying.*Rated AA (In Ontario) for frightening scenes and coarse language</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This trash doesn't miss a cliche</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a piece of teen slasher garbage. A totally forgettable film that contains every single cliche that has ever been used in a film of its' genre. The characters are all there; The wise cracking, obnoxious guys with over active hormones plus the usual assortment of females including one very horny girl, the prim and proper preppy and, of course, the really weird one. One of the reviews on this site compared this film to an Agatha Christie mystery. NO WAY !!! Ms. Christie could write better stuff than this right now, although she's been dead for many years. Unless you are a young teen ager, or have the mentality of one, skip this abomination.</fullReview>
