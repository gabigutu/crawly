		<shortDescription>The Thing: A classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Which version, Hawks or Carpenter? There's a lot of talk about which one is better, etc. I do agree with many that they both are very different films, very different viewing experiences. I love most good sci-fi. Some of 50's sci-fi can be dated after viewing. I do not think The Thing is one of these films which suffers from time . It holds up splendidly. If you like dialogue, you'll love this movie. If you like innuendo, fast paced overlapped dialogue, great characters - and I don't use that word lightly - you'll love this movie.If you want more suspense, a lot more blood, and a much more gloomy setting, certainly John Carpenter's remake is better in these areas. I own and enjoy viewing both films.Certainly, the creature in Carpenter's version is much more frightening, and truer to the John Campbell short story from which the story is based. His shape shifting would have been impossible to show in the 50's version with the believability that is possible in today's F/X field.Carpenter gives us a setting which is darker, colder, and more foreboding. A feeling of hopeless, and nameless dread pervades the camp. Certainly, the notion is clear that this could be the end of all of them, and of the world. There's both a lot less thinking, and a lot more action to be had here in the Carpenter 80's version than in the Hawks' 50's approach.Hawks, by contrast, created a feeling of "whistling in the dark", which dominates the setting. The characters, and they are many and varied, all have their own particular take on what is happening and what should be done about it. There is a sense of hopeful, "We can do it. We can solve this problem" attitude throughout the entire film. This feeling of "let's keep our heads" is contagious and very quickly the audience finds itself rooting, rather than running.One more point, and I think it's a big one. The characters in the Howard Hawks' 50's film are all likable, including the "heavy" - the wonderful Dr. Carrington. All the characters are capable, and in many cases, quite resourceful and ingenious. Each, always maintains a humorous, dry wit angle of attack on the situation without resorting to camp or parody seen in most comic film writing today. The military crew members, very quickly in the story, each displays a comical personality ribbing both the captain and the civil service nature of the military with natural ease. As someone once said, a complaining soldier is a happy soldier. So true. This is certainly no "military has all the answers" flick. The mistakes they make are roundly criticized by all in attendance, including the co-pilot's not so subtle comment about the splitting of the atom, "yeah, and that sure made the world happy, didn't it?" (laughter). Add to that, Ned Scott the newspaper man, and you've got a non-scientist, non-military chronicler character to round out the story, and give the audience someone with comparable skepticism about what to do next. Ned is the outsider who is now, like us, on the inside. The John Carpenter version, by comparison, has mostly losers populating the story, I have to say. From the camp leader, Gary, on down to the radio operator, Windows, most of the characters seem more suited as inmates in a minimum security prison than manning a research science station. (maybe a reflection of the lack of students going into the field of science in recent years? (chuckle) And to make the point even more ironic, there is no military, the usual scapegoats, in the Carpenter version. (Gary, as leader, carries the gun, and we assume has some military/policing role, though it is never made clear in the film.) These are all scientists with the exception of the helicopter pilot, played by Kurt Russell, who seems to be the only clear thinking member of the entire bunch. Why none of the actual scientists approach the problem as clearly, and logically as the rogue washed-up helicopter pilot is also a mystery and in large part, a flaw. In Hawks' version, Captain Hendry solicits advice from all in attendance, frequently asking the scientists and his crew technical questions for which he has no background to answer. This also gives the non technical audience member another "way in" to the technical side of things. (no pun intended)Why Carpenter chose to have most of the characters unredeeming, lazy, and in most cases, quite stupid and ill behaving, is a mystery. I find the characters in the Hawks version much more true to life.With all that said, I enjoy both films, each for their strengths and for their weaknesses. If you want blood and gore, more realistic sets, and are not discouraged by fairly shallow characters, the Carpenter version is for you.If you want fast paced dialogue, memorable characters, and you enjoy a "can-do" attitude in dreadful circumstances, all done with a minimum of visible gore, then Hawks' The Thing awaits you.humbleservant</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome movie that holds up today!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I love the remake very much I was finally able to see the original all the way thru without the colorization on TV. It is a truly awesome movie.Comparing the two is not really fare or easy as Carpenter's version has the benefits of modern movie magic. But that is in my opinion the only place it excels. It seems in the remake all the characters are derelicts and for the most part not very likeable. In the original you had a sense of these people liking each other and sticking together.Kenneth Tobey is a very good and believable leader of his men. He also shows a very human side in that he realizes he is not the smartest of men. He is what he is. A captain of a small band of Air Force Soldiiers simply doing their job.Robert Cornblaithe is excellent as Dr. Carrington. He comes of snootish yet still likeable enough because you can see that deep down he really admires Captain Hendry (Tobey) though he can't see eye to eye with him on their situation or dealing of his "Thing From Another world."Every character in the movie is well played. They all look like they belong in their roles. Their look and attire fit their characters and when one guy is called Professor so and so or whomever, you believe it unlike many movies in those days where they picked anyone to play the supporting actors. There is one thing though, Margaret Sheridan's pants pulled up almost to her neck line (exaggeration...but close) I could have done without. I realize it was a style of the times but I think they could have given her something a little better to show off her figure when you first meet her. Especially since she was the only female love interest and was tagged as "a pinup girl" in earlier scenes. She looks better when her hair is down and she is in different clothes. I know that is being picky but I just had to say it.The creature is better presented in the original as far as being frightening. You hardly ever see him. When you do it's only for brief periods at a time and usually in the dark. That frightening sound of "The Thing" is very original in that it's not just a growl but sounds like a cat meowing at times. Very eerie!The story is well known and both are similiar although I must admit the remake is closer to the actual Campbell JR.'s short tale. But the original still gives it a good account and in many ways surpasses the short story because it is easier to identify with the creature since he's humanoid.It boils down to suspense, drama and mood versus gore, F/X, and fast paced action. Both movies are top notch. I am proud to own both and would not try and say one is overtly better than the other. The remake has the benefits of the then modern movie technology. The original had the benefit of black and white to add to the suspense and utter danger they are in. The choice is yours. I myself enjoy the original a little more as it holds up today probably better than any other Sci-Fi movie from that era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Thing" without a doubt is one of the finest science fiction films ever made. A group of scientists and air force officers at an Arctic station discover something in the ice and that something sees them as dinner. The battle goes on in the claustrophobic station in a scenario that without a doubt was the model for the original "Aliens". The cast is a very fine ensemble and the direction is crisp and on the edge. Conversations overlap and at times runs simultaneously but the direction is so good that you miss nothing. Best of all is that this is one of those films where what you don't see is what scares you. There is no splatter or graphic detail but tantalizing hints that lets your mind conjure up your worst nightmare. A great one for a dark and stormy night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rhythmic masterpiece of sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me get my two (minor) complaints out of the way first: the attempt to get the UFO out of the ice felt rushed (as in the filmmakers wanted to get to the rest of the film) because I saw the result coming a mile away . . . it just felt soulless and obligatory. Second, the scientist Dr Carrington, rubbed up with the 'mad scientist in pursuit of knowledge risking everyone's life' cliché a bit too much for me . . . and I was trying to be forgiving since this was 50 years ago and far less cliché then. All right, now . . . I have to say, I loved The Thing from Another World. I loved the dialogue in this movie. It's been a long long (Jesus Christ, a loooong) time since I had this much fun listening to exposition. Yes, exposition. The obligatory plot details that no one cares about that some poor sap spells out? Yes, that exposition! Thing from Another World actually gains momentum with its exposition whereas your typical film slows down and comes to a screeching halt for it. Nyby spreads the exposition across about half a dozen characters, and they have real conversation with overlapping, quick fire, back and forth, dialogue, and in brief instances multiple conversations going at the same time. The result? Five minutes of exposition becomes one minute of exposition. Will the audience catch every single detail of their plan? No, but the audience doesn't need to either. Thank you Howard Hawks!Lace this exposition with characterization, inside jokes amongst characters, hints at their history together, and friendly pranks, and The Thing from Another World not only knocks out exposition with one blow, but develops their characters simultaneously, yielding a wonderfully complex and realistic relationship between the characters and plot. No spot light and overdone Shakespearian aside with melodramatic boo-hoo backstory that brings elicits yawns and groans, no little nerd with all the answers getting to explain everything while everyone asks stupid questions--nope--the Thing from Another World is above that drivel.Nyby and Hawks sold me on the characters from the get go, placing emphasis on how they introduce the characters and not so much in what their character backstory is. I salute the filmmakers for this decision, and in response was more than willing to suspend my disbelief for the sake of the film's needs. Follow it up with well lit and well staged action sequences--the fire scene was perhaps one of the most beautiful and glorious moments caught by b/w photography--and the Thing from Another World delivers with all its 1950s charms. I'll take a film with narrow corridors and electrodes over all out war with CGI bugs/machines any day of the week.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD...the title conjures up lurid images from the countless 'B' SciFi flicks of the 50s, but as many SF, Howard Hawks, and Classic Cinema fans can attest, this is no sleazy schlockfest, but one of the most entertaining and exciting films ever made, by one of Hollywood's greatest directors.Yes, the credits list Christian Nyby as director, but Howard Hawks was on the set nearly every day, each scene has elements of style unique to Hawks, alone, and even the cast members, when interviewed, have said Hawks ran the entire show. Perhaps, as Science Fiction films were not highly regarded in the early 50s, he felt his reputation might suffer if he acknowledged his contribution; perhaps he thought it might help Nyby's credentials if he were given credit for this masterfully crafted tale. Who knows? But rest assured...this IS a Howard Hawks film! The story, based on John Campbell's short story, 'Who Goes There?', is a nifty, claustrophobic tale of a group of soldiers and scientists in the Arctic, discovering a giant 'flying saucer' under the ice. When the ship blows up during the excavation, the 'pilot', a huge green chlorophyll-based humanoid (played by a young James Arness), is recovered, frozen in a block of ice. Bringing the ice-encased figure back to the base, it is then accidentally thawed out...and all Hell brakes loose!While the cast lacks big-name stars, each actor is wonderful, delivering wryly funny Hawks' dialogue at a breakneck pace. The military commander, Capt. Hendry (Kenneth Tobey), is a no-nonsense boss, respected and lovingly chided by his men, led by Dewey Martin, who constantly try to 'set him up' with a pretty scientist he had 'struck out' with, on leave in Anchorage (Margaret Sheridan). She is now at the base, assisting brilliant yet blissfully naive Dr. Arthur Carrington (Robert Cornthwaite), who, naturally, assumes 'the Thing' is only homicidal because he is misunderstood! As the truly frightening potential of the creature reveals itself, it becomes a race against time to destroy it, before it kills everyone, leaves the base, and reproduces countless seedlings of itself to conquer the world!The FX are low-budget, but very effective, as is the extensive use of light and shadow, sound effects, and an eerie Dimitri Tiomkin score. Unlike the benevolent 'visitors' of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, this alien doesn't warn of total annihilation as the final option, should we carry our nuclear weapons into space; it's ONLY agenda is to kill!This is a truly amazing film, one that has aged little, and is every bit as enjoyable today as when it was released.As the tag line to the film warns us, "Look to the sky..."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keep Watching the Skies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best science fiction pictures from the fifties, and one that helped define the genre, The Thing holds up remarkably well today. There's still considerable debate over whether producer Howard Hawks actually directed the film or credited director(and former editor) Christian Nyby. It's a Hawks production either way, and one of his best. The story of an alien invasion near the arctic circle, it builds slowly, relying heavily on the excellent, slangy dialogue of Charles Lederer, and the casual, jokey relationships between the various characters. This is lean, solid, old-fashioned moviemaking. There's not a wasted moment in this one. Hollywood in the studio era was especially good with stories of isolation, and this one's about as isolated as it gets. The monster is rarely seen, as we catch him only in horrifying glimpses, as the characters in the movie do. There's a standard brains versus brawn subtext in the film, but it's not emphasized to the movie's detriment. That the cast consists mostly of relative unknowns give the picture an almost documentary feeling at times, as if one were watching an actual event. Dimitri Tiomkin's spooky score helps spur the action on. This is a fine piece of commercial film-making, with everyone doing his job, and no "star turns". Nobody gets the upper hand here, not the actors, director, writer, cinematographer or alien. Everything comes together in the end. This is a perfect movie of its kind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Timeless Sci-Fi Classic Regardless of Era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thing From Another World is one of the top ten science fiction movies of all time. The original version feeds on our paranoia of the times as well as the fears of the atomic age and invasion from outerspace. Remember Mr. Arnold first saw what was called flying saucers only a few short years earlier. The acting and storyline are tight and first rate. The claustraphobia from being confined inside the North Pole with an alien running amoke is done very well. The cast rounds out the movie quite well with great performances of all of the characters. Granted to soem the movie may seem dated and lack special effects of the remake, but the remake does not capture the times and the fear of the so called Reds that this does. The Thing From Another World has to rank in the top ten. As a kid I thought it was one of the better, not to mention more frightening science fiction movies, up there with War of the Worlds and The Day The World Stood Still. This stands up story wise. Not all science fiction needs to have effects on the order of Star Wars. Sometimes, like horror, it's what you don't see that can get to you. This is a timeless classic. IT has to be in the top ten sci-fi films of all time. If you don't rent it, buy it. You will love it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Mankind Prevail? Or will we all become produce?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This fast paced thriller set in an Arctic research outpost has the familiar elements for the 1950's sci-fi movie: a hideous monster unleashed upon mankind, the U.S. military trying to cope with it, and the ever present scientist who wants a chance to glean the "wonders of the Universe" from said creature, all at the same time.Howard Hawks' adaptation of John Campbell Jr.'s short story, "Wh o Goes There?" may not be completely faithful, but nonetheless, the suspenseful plot about an Arctic research team's discovery of a recently landed spaceship embedded in the ice, and more importantly, it's lone occupant is still gripping today.When this frozen alien carcass is accidentally thawed out back inside the research station, all hell breaks loose. As soon as the Air Force contingent(led by Kenneth Tobey) realizes that their visitor from space is bent on "feeding" on the human residents there, a "cat and mouse" situation is set up.The Thing is first repelled out into the Arctic blizzard, giving the lead scientist (Robert Cornthwaite) enough time to theorize that it's a highly evolved vegetable from outer space, and therefore, MUST be advanced enough to impart the answers to all man's questions if given a chance to communicate.Therein lies a major conflict between the Air Force personnel and this scientist... the military sees The Thing as a threat, and the scientist sees The Thing as a fountain of knowledge in disguise. Some disguise! James Arness plays the E.T. visitor which appears at key moments through the film as a menacing humanoid with unusual claw-like hands, and though it is inferred that it is vegetable rather than animal, you're left to your imagination as to what exactly the creature is composed of. The brief encounters with the Thing as it returns from the unseen depths of the storm to feed on human blood is heralded with the ominous ticking of the crew's Geiger counter. Tension mounts as it draws nearer and nearer to the vulnerable wooden buildings of the outpost.Once it has been revealed that Science wants to "protect" the Thing (as the Dr. Carrington has planted seedlings from the Thing's tissue remains into their greenhouse lab for an eerie result of reproduction), the military binds together with a plot to destroy It.Although lacking in modern sophistication and effects, this film allows the viewer to be marooned with the hapless research and Air Force crew to face an Unknown, a common enemy... a theme so highly epitomized by the McCarthy era of anti-Communism that engulfed the nation at that time. I say this will always be a classic unto itself, and though not in any way comparable to John Carpenter's 1982 re-make in terms of gore, horror and psychological perspective, it still carries its own due to the snappy script and sense of foreboding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sci-Fi Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thing AKA The Thing (From Another World) By Tom Fowler The Thing is over 50 years old now and remains one of the all time great science fiction films. Released in 1951 and ghost directed by Howard Hawks, (Christian Nyby being the credited director), The Thing holds up well even by today's standards of shock and graphic violence. A mysterious craft has crash landed in the ice of Antarctica. A team of scientists and soldiers fly to the crash site and find a strange vehicle imbedded in the ice. The vehicle is tragically destroyed by temperature bombs in attempt to thaw the ice and free it. Even so, an alien trapped in a block of ice has survived the blast and the team returns to base camp with it for further examination. This is when the psychological aspects of the find and the terror that James (Marshall Matt Dillon) Arness' monster brings to the screen merge into a great story. (The Thing is loosely based on John W. Campbell, Jr.'s `Who Goes There?'). The scientist, ably portrayed by Robert Cornthwaite, is dangerously misguided in his attitude toward the creature, a creature that he knows no more about than any of the others stationed at their lonely outpost. Cornthwaite believes the creature to be man's superior `in every way,' a mistaken opinion he would almost lose his life for. Kenneth Tobey, who we would see often in this kind of film throughout the 1950's, portrays the officer in charge of the camp and represents the opposite view from the scientist, that of fear and suspicion. We see just enough of the creature to make him impressive and all of the gore is off camera and well within our overactive imaginations. The creature, who was thawed by accident underneath an electric blanket, is finally slain at film's end, but not without tremendous cost in lives and, particularly in the case of scientist Cornthwaite, emotional devastation. There are some frightening scenes in The Thing, most of them including the monster. The site of Tobey slamming the greenhouse door shut after discovering almost too late that the monster is standing behind it is very effective. (A friend has said the site of the monster attempting to wriggle it's hand free generated nightmares for several days). The last scene of the film, when the monster runs amuck and attacks Cornthwaite, is one of the most atmospheric of the genre. But, perhaps the most frightening scene of all to thoughtful viewers is the picture of Cornthwaite's lab, where we see alien spores being fed human blood intravenously within the confines of a common wooden box / garden planter. The Thing is indeed a classic and, I believe, benefited from being shot in black and white. The Kurt Russell remake many years later was done in color and, although a fine film in its own right, did not offer the sense of isolation and bleakness the Hawk's version did. The running time for The Thing is 87 minutes and if you choose to rent or buy it on DVD or VHS, be wary of 81 minute versions. Oh yes, as the reporter at film's end said, be certain to `Keep Watching the skies!' Not a bad idea, for The Thing packs quite a wallop even today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic despite the message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a remote arctic location, a military unit gets a call from a research unit to come and investigate a reported plane crash. On arrival the unit travel out to the site to find that the plane is actually a disk shaped craft of unidentified metal. However, on trying to remove it from the ice they destroy the craft but salvage it's frozen pilot. Back at base the `thing' defrosts with violent results and the survivors are faced with destroying man's only contact with alien life or being destroyed themselves.Like many people (I assume) I saw the 80's remake before I saw the original, so I came to it with an idea already formed about what the `thing' meant to me. So it was good to step back to the original and see what made this film stand out from a raft of `reds in the bed' type sci-fi's that were around at the time. The plot is intelligent and interesting enough to sustain interest despite the fact that direct conflict with the thing is limited to a few key scenes. The tension is helped by the thing being sufficiently unseen to create a sense of unknown menace and the shadows are well placed.The action can't compare to the remake in terms of effects, but it is well staged. As I just said, the limited view of the alien we have means it doesn't lose impact due to poor effects. One scene in particular is very good ? the fire scene in the room. It is dramatic and well staged for maximum effect. If the film does have a weakness it is that it is a Hawks film. Most of his touches are good ? the romantic banter, the group theme ? but for me his political view was a tad heavy.In many sci-fi's we see the aliens come to earth in peace and it is only mankind's own violence that puts us at risk. Here mankind attacks any alien immediately without any idea of peace or preserving the specimen. The only character who puts this line forward is made to look weak and foolish compared to the rest. No, Hawks is no dove! His line is that any outsiders must e treated with fear and dealt with as strongly as required. I don't agree with this line of reasoning so it took away from the film for me, but the rest of it was very enjoyable.The acting is top rate ? a mix of banter and B-movie, strong jawed American heroes! Overall this may be seen as dull or slow for the generation that has grown up on Kurt Russell freezing in the final scene but it is a classic in it's own right and is a much more accomplished piece of work for my money. Despite some weaknesses in Hawks personal beliefs this is a atmospheric and tense piece of sci-fi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"An intellectual carrot. The mind boggles."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>- On the surface, The Thing from Another World (The Thing for short) would appear to be just another of the hundreds of sci-fi/horror films that flooded the market in the 50s. The basic story of the discovery of a UFO near the North Pole with an inhabitant frozen in a block of ice sounds typical for the period. But this film is anything but typical.- There are so many positive things to say about The Thing that narrowing them down to fit into a manageable size review is difficult. Very briefly, some of the things that impress me about The Thing include: the opening title sequence, the wonderful music score, the sets, the amazing kerosene fire scene, the terrific jump scare the first time we see the creature, and the desolate North Pole setting. Everything about the movie is near perfect as far as I'm concerned.- One of the most impressive things to me, however, is the decision to use the creature sparingly throughout the movie. Because we only catch glimpses of the alien, he remains a mystery and, as a result, more frightening. I don't know if this is the case or not as I've never heard John Carpenter speak on the subject, but as I watched the movie last night, I couldn't help be think of Carpenter's decision to use The Thing in his movie, Halloween. Surely it wasn't a coincidence (or a cheap plug for his upcoming remake). Instead, I've always felt that the way Carpenter used The Shape in Halloween is much like way the creature is used in this movie. I don't know if anyone agrees, but I definitely see similarities.- I can narrow down what makes this film so special to me into two words - Howard Hawks. If you're so inclined, there are any number of articles you can read on the internet about who really directed the movie - Hawks or Nyby. I don't know and I don't care, but it's easy to see Hawks' fingerprints all over The Thing. The most obvious example is the whole dialogue thing. In most of Hawks' movies I've seen, the dialogue is incredibly intelligent, snappy, and witty. It's part of what makes his movies so much fun. Hawks also had a way of getting actors to sound less like they were reciting lines and more like they were having actual conversations. Actors routinely step all over each others' lines and interrupt one another just like real people do. If you've ever seen His Girl Friday, you know exactly what I'm talking about. I love it.- I could literally go on and on discussing The Thing from Another World. I haven't even touched on the comparisons with The Day the Earth Stood Still (released the same year) or the treatment of the scientists vs. the treatment of the Army or the portrayal of women or the whole Soviet invasion subtext or the "Watch the skies" speech or ... you get the idea. It's truly a remarkable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 50's classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1939 John W. Campbell Jr wrote a short story called Who Goes There? and it was about a alien that could copy us making paranoia between the characters, in 1951 legendary filmmaker Howard Hawks created a film loosely based on the short story called The Thing From Another World. The film ditches the shape shifting alien to a completely different alien, The Thing is a vegetable like creature that can reproduce and looks a little like Frankenstien's Monster. Although the plot is slightly different it's still a great movie, in 1982 horror master John Carpenter being a fan of Howard Hawks film The Thing From Another World decided to remake it as The Thing which is a more faithful adaptation of the short story since it deals with an alien that can copy us and the characters start to become paranoid of each other.Both films are classics, The Thing From Another World is a mix of horror and modern science, the monster make-up is pretty cool and is effective for The Thing. The Thing From Another World is a 50's sci-fi classic that should be seen. Check this out and remember keep watching the skies. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As all lovers of the SciFi film genre knows, The Thing (1951), is undoubtedly one of the the finest ever produced. It's almost a perfect movie from a purely technical standpoint. The direction, no matter who it was, was scintillating, moving from moment to moment at breakneck speed. Tiomkin's gut-wrenching score, highlighted by the extremely futuristic Theremin, crushing basses and bleak windswept strings are the epitome of horror/sci-fi film scoring. The acting is legendary for it's naturally fluid feel, it's backhanded asides and well documented over-speak not matched in many movies before or since. Unlike today's boringly formula rip-offs the station is usually "well lit", at least as well lit as you would imagine a 1950's Arctic Lab to be; aided by the superb efforts of the film makers own lighting crew. This allowed for those brief moments of darkness when the lights were out to have a very real panicking effect. Not only on the audience but the besieged occupants of our Arctic fortress. I also found it refreshing that after the one incident where the "Thing" is carelessly freed, the expedition members subsequently and intelligently arm themselves as best they can and form into groups. I believe that the creature's first close up appearance is only 3 seconds long but it was enough to make me rapidly exit the living room and stop me from watching this film from when I first saw it at age 7 in 1958 until I was about 15. This chilling scene when viewed in a stop frame mode is astonishing in it's precision and choreography, check this out my sci-fi brethren. A scene my own dear father managed to duplicate with great effect, as a joke, using our dark and seldom used front porch door, which reduced me to a sniveling jelly-legged puddle when I was about 10!, which, in homage to both Dad and Arness, I duplicated some 20 years later on not only my son, but the cleaning lady and my wife with equally devastating effect. You know , they even manage a little romance without destroying the story, truly amazing. Don't we all wish Margaret Sheridan was our girl?But I have written this comment not to just rehash what we all know to be true; but rather to pay homage to the one man who ultimately is responsible for the survival of the human race. Bob, the crew chief. Yes, Bob. In a situation where we have a rafter of genius scientists, alongside of battle hardened veteran Air Corps officers and a smart funny, gritty, albeit nerdy, newspaper reporter; we are all very lucky to have had BOB, the crew chief on the job. I will not enumerate (and spoil the fun) but his mighty contributions to the survival of this hearty group are something to behold. If you veterans who love this movie as much as I do watch this movie again, as we all will, watch it this time and see if you don't agree that Bob comes up with 90% or better of the intelligent suggestions. For those of you who have not had the pleasure of seeing this movie it is a "must see". From a time when movies gave free rein to our own fertile imaginations; it terrified without graphic gore; amazed without a gazillion dollars of special effects and best of all entertained at a pace rarely attained by any movie from any genre in any generation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Military Versus The Scientists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mixture of scientists and Air Force personnel plus one news correspondent are at a base in Alaska doing research and protecting us from Joe Stalin and the Reds when they soon have something more dangerous to deal with. A spaceship, a saucer shaped spaceship in fact arrives on Earth. And it has a creature piloting it played without dialog, just grunts courtesy of James Arness.Wherever this creature is from, evolution has been turned on its head because it's the plants who developed intelligence on that world. The way we use plants for our food and to feed animals that become our food is the reverse of how it works on Earth. Our blood, human and animal is necessary to for its growth.What to do with it is the subject of a spirited debate between the military and the scientists, represented by Kenneth Tobey and Robert Cornthwaite respectively. It's really the crux of what makes The Thing such a classic. The fact is both men are right. There's a lot to be learned from the creature if he'll stop to communicate in some way. The military is also right in assessing just how dangerous a threat this plant creature is.Christian Nyby standing in for Howard Hawks who produced the film and closely supervised, directed this chilling in every sense of the word science fiction classic. The cast is a group of competent second line professionals, no stars involved here.Nevertheless Kenneth Tobey is a good stand-in for one of Howard Hawks's favorite leading men, John Wayne. Since Wayne never did any kind of science fiction film, I'm wondering if this film might have been offered to him. There's also a romantic subplot involving Tobey and Margaret Sheridan who could have been standing in for Hawks leading ladies Lauren Bacall or Joanne Dru.Maybe such familiar folks would have detracted from the story. The Thing stands well on its own merits as one of the best science fiction stories ever done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Science Fiction Thrillers of the 1950s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although there were two directors on THE THING (or THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD), the fact that Howard Hawks got involved adds one more star to his list of first rate movies - and the only one that he did in the area of science fiction. If one thinks of the director of comedies like BRINGING UP BABY or I WAS A MALE WAR BRIDE directing a science fiction film, you would be surprised - but then Hawks also did well with crime films (SCARFACE) and westerns (RED RIVER). Apparently Christian Nyby took most of Hawks' ideas and put them to work in the film. Good move Christian!It's now generally assumed that most of the great science fiction and horror films of the early 1950s were veiled discussions of either the Communist threat to America or of the threat McCarthism in this country . But there were strong currents in that period that were not really available earlier periods of film science fiction films. In the 1950s the remarkable (if bloodstained) achievements in science in the World War (radar, jet planes, rocket bombs, the atomic bomb) made people more aware of science as never before. Tied to this was the sudden phenomenon of UFO sitings that - whether true or not - were finally being given serious consideration by the media.THE THING is set in a hostile environment - but one that is an "acceptable" hostile environment for government purposes. Polar exploration had been in the hands of the military from all nations from the 16th Century onward. Such explorers like Martin Frobisher were part-time naval commanders. In the 19th Century it was a rarity for a civilian to get involved (Thomas Simpson, the man who actually first sited the spot the "Northwest Passage" would most likely be at, was an exception - but he worked for the Hudson's Bay Company). More typical figures involved were Sir John Franklin (lost with two shiploads of British naval personnel in 1848) or Lt. Robert Peary (later Rear Admiral Peary) or Commander Robert Scott. After 1920 the typical polar expedition would be one led by somebody like Rear Admiral Richard Byrd. In 1931 Byrd would nearly die in an experiment in Antarctica regarding isolation in a tent (his stove malfunctioned, but some of his men found him in time).So the cast here are at the North Pole, under joint command of Captain Hendry (Kenneth Tobey) and Dr. Carrington (Robert Cornthwaite). There is also a member of the fourth estate present to report the expedition's results (Scotty, played by Douglas Spencer). During the expedition's regular work they find the wreckage of an unidentified flying saucer. They also find the frozen remains of a creature. The creature is the title figure of "The Thing". If you look closely you will recognize the actor playing this creature is James Arness. While far from his GUNSMOKE role of Marshal Matt Dillon, keep in mind that in the 1950s Arness varied western roles (John Ford's WAGON MASTER) with serious adventure films (ISLAND IN THE SKY) and other science fiction parts (THEM!). He is actually quite effective as the creature, especially in his later rampages.As long as the creature is frozen there is no real problem, but one of the men makes the mistake of putting a blanket on top of the permafrost "icecube" the Thing is lying in. The blanket is an electric blanket, and it melts the permafrost - thus releasing the Thing. Subsequently it is discovered that the creature is not mammalian like man, nor reptilian, but an intelligent form of vegetable.The best science fiction films manage to get some convincing dialog in about these points. Carrington and his fellow scientist Dr. Stern (Eduard Franz) discuss the possibility of intelligent vegetable life forms on earth, including plants that eat small rodents. Carrington is fascinated by this creature, and realizes that it is actually more intelligent than man is - he (in his misguided zeal) hopes to actually talk to the creature and learn from it for man's benefit. This does not sit well with Hendry, especially after two of the staff are butchered by the creature (apparently it's survival is predicated on the use of animal blood). I will go on a limb and say no other 1950s film really dealt with the conflict of pure science (Carrington) and self-defense or government defense (Hendry) as THE THING did. Carrington, a Nobelist, sees learning as the end and be-all of mankind. Hendry sees survival as more important. Most would probably agree with Hendry, but Carrington does maintain a type of respect with the audience until nearly the end of the film when he loses it a bit.The cast handled the roles well. Cornwaithe never had a better part in movies (and I'm glad to note in his last film he repeated the part). Tobey's Captain is intelligent and keeps the loyalty of both his own men and most of the scientists. He also has several moments when a romance between him and scientist Nikki (Margaret Sheridan) heats up (in typical Hawkian role reversal, she plies him with drink while he is tied up, to make sure she controls the date!). Spencer's newsman is rather believable (his skepticism about outer space creatures gradually dissolving - he has the famous last words of the film, "Look to the skies!"). Spencer also is constantly remembering past assignments in World War II, and even covering the execution of Ruth Snyder in 1928. Also doing well in supporting parts are Franz (a more rational scientist than Cornwaithe), Dewey Martin (an electrician who figures out how to solve the danger), and - of all people - George Fennimen as one of the soldiers. In short the film is one of the best science fiction thrillers to come along, and well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Howard Hawks production marks this 50's Sci Fi Classic as a must see...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A scientific expedition, located near the North Pole, sends an urgent message to an Air Force Base in Anchorage, Alaska reporting the near-by crash of a very large, unknown, object and requesting immediate assistance. Air Force Captain Pat Hendry, and his crew, then depart to this expeditionary site. Upon arrival, Captain Hendry meets Dr. Carrington, who's in charge. Preliminary scientific evidence rules out the possibility of a meteor. Also, since this crash, a lot of atmospheric and magnetic disturbance has been generated, making radio communications and aircraft navigation difficult, if not impossible. AT this point, Captain Hendry and his crew, along with Dr Carrington with some members of his staff, depart to the crash scene about 50 miles away. Upon arrival, part of an aircraft structure is protruding above the ice and appears to be "alien" in origin. Attempts to remove this aircraft, using thermal "thermite" heat bombs proves unsuccessful. This "Flying Saucer" is destroyed, but its occupant is thrown clear and becomes frozen under the ice. This body is then removed and taken back to this expeditionary site and put in cold storage. Everything appears to be under control until an unforseen accident occurs endangering not only the lives ov everyone at this expeditionary site, but all human and animal life on the entire face of planet Earth. There are some lighter sides to this Sci Fi drama. I enjoy the good natured kidding that Captain Hendry receives from his men after his girl friend pins an embarrassing not on his chest while he's asleep giving everybody ample opportunity to read it. I also get a kick out of the newspaper reporter Ned "Scotty" Scott's on going battle with Captain Hendry in trying to obtain permission to broadcastcast his "Flying Saucer" story to the media and Captain Hendry's refusal to let him until offical Air Force clearance can be given. Also, keep an eye out for George Fennamen, from Groucho Marx's old TV quiz show "You Bet Your Life."</fullReview>

The subtle presence of multiple doors leading to small passageways within the research station leads the view to wonder which door will reveal the alien.

		<shortDescription>a must-see for fans of sci-fi and horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thing, released in 1951, is the original hostile alien movie, a must-see for fans of sci-fi and horror.Major director Howard Hawks (Sergeant York, The Big Sleep, Red River, Rio Bravo) produced it but some sources (Leonard Maltin) credit him as co-director. Christian Nyby, a film editor for Hawks, is officially credited as the director. Whoever directed it, The Thing is an impeccably crafted movie. It's considered as a Grade B movie, probably because of its subject matter, but it's one of the best Grade B's along with Them and Invasion of the Body Snatchers.A group of scientists at the North Pole discover something buried in the ice. Unknowingly they bring back part of it to the camp for study.The acting is solid and the characters are given great dialog. Kenneth Tobey is the take charge Captain Patrick Hendry. Robert Cornthwaite is great as the slightly nutty Dr. Carrington. Douglas Spencer as Scotty is fun as the wisecracking reporter always looking for a photo. Margaret Sheridan is Nikki the shapely love interest. James Arness plays The Thing monster. With an ensemble cast of supporting actors. Be sure to rent the DVD version because it has a few scenes between Tobey and Sheridan that were always cut for TV and VHS probably because they were considered a little too racy for the time although now they are just cute.The film has held up well for over fifty years. The film's contributors were seasoned professionals who had worked on major films. The screenplay by Charles Lederer (Mutiny on the Bounty, Ocean's Eleven, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, His Girl Friday) is full of crisp dialog. The black and white cinematography by Russell Harlan (Red River, Witness for the Prosecution, To Kill A Mockingbird, Run Silent Run Deep) makes everything look right. The prolific film composer Dmitri Tiompkin provides a very eerie, theremin-based score.After 50 years this movie rightly earns the label of classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When watching this motion picture the viewer should always keep in mind that it was made in 1951. The science fiction genre was still in its infancy. This of course is a classic along with The Day the Earth Stood Still, War of the Worlds, Invasion of the Body Snatchers. The story which does divert from the John Campbell story "Who Goes There" still manages to offer the viewer a sense of terror and isolation as the crewmembers of the Arctic station battle the Alien. It has a few light moments of humor and a little romance is thrown in. Most sci-fi films of this era contained these elements. Of course the military personnel were always depicted as the ones who would eventually rid the world of the menace from Outer Space and got technical support from the scientists who seemed sympathetic to the Alien/creatures plight. This was how films like this one were made and should be enjoyed that way.</fullReview>

The revelation of the saucer itself, for instance, is still creepy; as is the scene with the slowly furling and unfurling hand; and the discovery of the dead dog; or the scene where it's revealed that the Thing is essentially a Vampire from Outer Space. The biggie, however, remains the attempted ambush of the creature and its violent escape out into the snow. The music helps make it all scarier still.

		<fullReview>Air Force officers and scientists in the Arctic find a crashed spaceship buried in ice. In their attempts to recover the ship, they accidentally destroy it. However, it's not a total loss as they find the body of an alien also under the ice. They take the body back to their base but, when the ice thaws, they discover the alien is still alive and very deadly.Science fiction classic that was the first of the alien invasion movie boom of the 1950s. The script is terrific and the actors excellent. They bring life to the characters and make them seem real and (almost all) likable. While he's not the star, Douglas Spencer as the reporter Scotty gets some of the best lines. This was the highlight of his career. Robert Cornthwaite is also good in a role that would become a cliché in sci-fi movies in the years after: the scientist who values knowledge more than life. The credited director is Christian Nyby, but producer Howard Hawks at the very least was looking over Nyby's shoulder and making sure it turned out the way he wanted. The movie has many of the Hawks trademarks. Particularly with the male and female leads, played by Kenneth Tobey and Margaret Sheridan, who are very Hawksian characters. There's also the distinctive Hawks overlapping dialogue and banter. It's this part of the film, more than any other one element, that separates it from other sci-fi films of the period. It's a very smart movie. A very fun movie. A true classic that should be on any sci-fi fan's must-see list. Also catch the 1982 remake, which is one of the best remakes ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cold Quarters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the popular elements of suspense thrillers has been on the unknown intruder invading a santurary. It's based on our subconscious fear that they place that we feel safest can be turned into the most dangerous. This is one of my favorite sci-fi film let alone my favorite film from director Howard Hawks. Personally I'm a fan of Carpenter version that story and on a side note is one of my favorite films in general. But this version I really liked because it's good in it's own way, let alone different.I really like the music it really works well for the film, at times it sounds really eerie and unsettling. However it's the theme song I really like the most which I think is memorable and one of my favorite themes because it's one about menace and the unknown.The suspense I think is great, there is a sense of being unsafe. At the scenes when the Thing isn't around, you just know in the back of your mind the Thing will come anywhere at any time, but the revolving questions throughout the film are when and where. One of my favorite suspenseful sequences are of course the giger counter, when a character indicates how high the needle is steadily going up while the blinker is going faster and faster. That blinker you could say represents the pounding of my heart and literally put me on the edge of my seat, because it was an indicator that trouble was coming. This of course was an inspiration for the radar scenes in "Alien" and "Aliens" you can say it further shows how timeless the film is.I even like the design of the base and the use of light and shadow which really give the film a claustrophobic and dangerous atmosphere. You really feel that on the next turn, shadow or the next hallway the Thing could be hiding, waiting to close in for the kill. And the fact that this base is located in the middle of the Attic also leaves the element of isolation, which means they can't get sufficient help when they need it the most let alone there is no where to go in the cold enviorment, and the base is even worse because there are limited spaces to run and hide from the creature. Which unfortunately leaves them with the classic dilemma of being in a rock and a hard place.The characters are solid, there not exactly deep characters but you do get to know some of them enough to like the protagonists and care; their dialog is solid and memorable, it feels like the kind of things you'd talk and say in the real world (well sort of). It's true there are a lot of protagonists which is usual a bad idea but it actually works hear because most to all of them have something to do and it's something I don't see enough in the horror genre usually it's reduced down to a small sum of three to one, depending on who survives. I really like the character Captain Patrick Henry he's a take charge kind of guy that cares about the people of the base.Nikki despite not having a whole lot to do, I think is a solid female protagonist, I like that she's not some stereotypical screamer, is solid under pressure, is smart and has the persona to boot. I like the fact that both the characters Pat and Nikki have some sort of love relationship going on, their back and forth I think is genuine.Scotty is a fun character, I like that he's not a stereotypical egocentric reporter. Yeah he does desire fame and is restless with the ambition for the great story, but he doesn't let that get to his head. And he helps everyone out with their current situation so he not useless. And of course the guy says my favorite quote in the end which has been famous through time.Dr. Arthur Covington is a solid subordinate villain, he's sort of like a religious fanatic as we see he's fallen into that classic psychological trap of discovery becoming obsession. He does what he can to sabatosh the protagonists efforts in survival. When he says a line that it's the group duty to die in the name of science, I know he's gone to the circus, because that's the same attitude a cultist would have toward a false religion and profit. In a way it gets at the one theme in the film about the corrupt side of science; science can be used to benefit mankind but when used irresponsibly or for selfish or corrupt purpose it can lead to mankind's extinction.The Thing monster played well by James Arness doesn't disappoint. I like the makeup design which is memorable, he's an intimidating brute, I remember when I first seen him once the door was opened, I though "Oh s..." and jumped. It's true that he's not in the film that much and we see him in brief periods of time, but that works to it's benefit because the fact it's hidden most of the time makes it a force to be reckoned with because it operates in the shadows. It's characteristics are just as menacing because the creature has no heart literally, which means he has no conscious so you can't reason or bargain with it if you talk with him face to face. Plus it's got some super strength and is hard to kill, which really raises the stakes for the protagonists.Beware and watch the skies, you never know what's flying in.Rating: 4 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this picture was released in 1951 it was a box office bonanza. It was one of the first intelligent sci-fi films with a smart screenplay. Every year that has past, it is voted as one of the top 10 science-fiction pictures ever made. In every film book it is rated four stars. They tried to remake it in 1982 and it was a a total flop. Every thing about this film was a delight from its wonderful cast to the excellent black and white photography. Never has any film scared so many people. I use to stand at the back of the theatre every night just to watch people jump out of their seat. James Arness started his career as the Thing and Kenneth Toby went on to make many other sci-fi pictures, but none as good as this one. This picture still holds up. Who needs all those endless special effects and brilliant color? There was great color in 1951 but Howard Hawks was right on making this picture in B&amp;W. This is one of the bright spots in the sci-fi world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classy, witty, poignant and breathlessly atmospheric - one of the defining films of its genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is an inherent tendency to dismiss or discount vintage science fiction movies, with special effects now coming across as dated (despite being cutting edge during their time) and plot and dialogue often ridiculed as cheesy and melodramatic. Yet again, such generalizations can never do justice to any genre as a whole, and often simply result in particularly admirable efforts, such as The Thing From Another World being unfairly discarded from the realm of cultural common knowledge. Yet the concept of the film being denied the same sort of plaudits and appreciation other highlights of its era enjoy comes across as nonsensical as well as unfair, as The Thing From Another World manages to work around its criticized genre conventions and deliver one of the most intelligent, sensibly constructed and effectively atmospheric science fiction films, or, debatably, films period of its era.Although Howard Hawks is not credited as director (the billed honour is given to debut director Christian Nyby), the film carries too many overtones of being a Hawks film (fast talking, overlapping dialogue, character complexity and a certain abrasive sense of simultaneous fun and seriousness) for his influence to be discarded. But, regardless of whence the creative input came from, the film stands out as markedly more sensibly put together than the pulpy B-movie its premise could have suggested, turning a simple alien attack into a breathlessly atmospheric study of individuals and groups in an enclosed, isolated area, when beset by an adversary they cannot know or understand. While John Carpenter's critically championed remake The Thing extracted fear through never knowing who to believe or trust by turning his alien into a shape-shifter (remaining closer to John W. Campbell Jr.'s literary source material), its predecessor addresses notions of the unknown through positioning the concept as the outsider - the titular Thing. As such, the film addresses politically poignant notions of the team of good, old fashioned, honest Americans banding together against the unknown Other devoid of morality (suggesting unmistakable communism undertones; whether the film is explicitly anti- communist or satirically poking fun at the Red Scare remains to be seen). Through this approach the film becomes almost more of a war or combat film than a sci-fi thriller, with the Thing being easily substituted by any enemy army attempting to breach the American headquarters being destroyed by an instant, unsettling mechanical proficiency seemingly just as 'devoid of morality' or emotion as the Thing is previously labeled (it is particularly poignant how quickly the team snaps to business, not even stopping to be shocked when confronted with a threat in need of being destroyed). The subsequent thematic contrast between the two groups on the Artic base, the army (who want to destroy the Thing) and the scientists (who want to study it) makes for an uneasy situating of viewer sympathies. Although Kenneth Tobey's Captain Hendry is clearly defined as the film's protagonist, his actions are not always endorsable, and Robert Cornethwaite's chief scientist, roughly situated as an antagonist figure, is mercifully not reduced to a crazed madman figure, but a very calm, sensible man, who, although his actions are continually dismissed, may very well be right. The film also near miraculously defies notions of being dated through its crisp black and white photography offering an uncommonly sophisticated visual aesthetic for its time. Similarly, unlike many of its contemporaries, Nyby and Hawks sensibly avoid showcasing their film's not entirely convincing special effects, often denying the audience expectation of seeing the Thing in all its macabre glory, or filming it in silhouette, or from a distance. Such a technique, echoed by Steven Spielberg in the far more critically recognized Jaws twenty-four years later, not only further situates the character as the unknown by also remaining mostly unseen, but serves as much more frightening and eerie than a man in a rubber suit ever could. The film also serves to address a growing cultural uneasiness against nature and the planet striking back, by having its creature (albeit an alien one) be a sophisticated form of plant life, as if directly representative of 'nature striking back' against the rising capabilities of science. The film's cast also stand out as giving particularly measured and credible performances in contrast to the outlandish melodrama usually heralded by the genre. Kenneth Tobey delivers a masterclass in solid American sensibilities and charm without outright adapting a John Wayne accent, and Margaret Sheridan also suggests Hawks' presence by being an exceptionally strong, quick witted and independent love interest, more than capable of holding her own against the more stoic Tobey. Robert Cornthwaite's measured calm makes his chief scientist all the more fascinating and, crucially, sympathetic and believable, and Douglas Spencer's bone dry wit perfectly makes for a surrogate comic relief figure as a wisecrack dropping reporter, while his seeming out of place feels entirely appropriate given the fish-out-of-water character.It is these uncommonly canny bits of cultural awareness and sophistication (which may or may not be attributable to the Hawks influence) which rise the film several cuts above the caliber of many of its pulpy followers, making The Thing From Another World not just a white-knuckled study in claustrophobia and interpersonal tension, but one of the more sophisticated, atmospheric and poignant films of its era, enough to keep viewers "watching the skies" for decades to come. -10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies from the old "Creature Double Feature" days of my youth. The actors and the director take the material very serious. I was on the edge of my seat listening to the Geiger counter go crazy as the Thing got closer. Even after all these years, it still gets my heart beating. The score is excellent, and I wish some of today's movies could be like this one. Two iconic images in mind involve the thing and fire and with electricity. Great stuff!! Watch the skies indeed! The story involves a crashed spaceship and what they find there. Still to this day, I love the scene where they stretch out on the ice to see how big it is. The dialog is fast and witty. There is some humor to this story. The characters seemed real to me, a credit to all involved in the making. You cared about what happened to them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes Less is Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1951 adaptation of the short story "Who Goes There" is probably one of, if not the best Science Fiction Movie made in the 1950s. And I say this about a movie that had minimal special effects, and a cast of basically unknown character actors. There were only a couple of SciFi movies made in this decade that come close, and three of them had the advantage of starring well known actors (Forbiddden Planet-Walter Pigeon / Day the Earth Stood Still - Michael Rennie / War of the Worlds - Gene Barry).Anyway, back to the movie at hand. The THING From Another World stands out for many reasons. First and foremost is Hawk's realistic treatment of human behavior. People in this movie talk over one another. Not a lot, but just enough to match real life. Nervous laughter is heard, even during the most tense situations, from those in peril. Secondly, the camera angles and lighting add to the sense of remote isolation, and of an unknown danger lurking around every corner. The actors are perfectly matched to the varied roles, both in appearance and demeanor. Take for example the journalist, Scotty. This was the way journalist's looked and behaved in the early 1950s. My uncle was a reporter during that time. I went on many assignments with him. Believe me, the actor playing Scotty was a perfect fit. I can go on and on about the merits of this movie, but I won't. Just a couple more points if I may.... SOME OF THE COMMENTARY BELOW MAY BE CONSIDERED A SPOILER.The dialog, especially from the scientist Doctor Carrington, is thought provoking and rather intelligent. He explains the nature of the creature, from a sample taken from a severed hand. All of the group are huddled around a small table, the background in dark shadows. The good doctor equates the tissue on the table to that of a plant. Just the idea of intelligently evolved plant life is provocative and mentally stimulating. But this is where The THING diverges from the original source material. In the original story, The Thing was a shape shifting entity, that could take the form of any living being. This transformation was attempted in the John Carpenter THING from the early 1980s, and in my opinion, was disappointing. Sometimes less is better. I have always much preferred the "intelligent carrot" adaptation used by Hawks. However, he should have kept the audience from directly viewing James Arness in a jumpsuit. Quick glimpses would have sufficed and been much more effective.My favorite scene of any movie of this genre, and possibly of any movie of all time, is when the expedition group forms the circle over the frozen saucer under the ice. The music builds to a crescendo, and then stops dead. There is then several minutes of silence as the group suddenly realizes what they are standing over. What impact! It was due to the treatment of scenes such as this that made Howard Hawks a master of his trade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HOWARD HAWKS' MASTERPIECE IN SCI-FI TERROR</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD! is one of the greatest sci-fi classic sci-fi films, and was mostly the inspiration for a lot of the other loads of sci-fi films that were shipped out to theaters in the 50s. The masterpiece science fiction film is still fast-paced and shocking today. The story is about a crew of scientists in the Arctic who discovered a UFO that has sunk beneath the snow. From inside it, they find a Martian that is trapped in ice. When the ice accidentally thaws, it turns out to be a bloodthirsty fiend smarter than humans. The crew must then survive the creature and somehow find its weakness, or else, if they try to escape it, they will freeze in a matter of minutes outside of the lodge. A must-see for sci-fi lovers, and one of Warner Brothers' best sci-fi hits.Grade: 9/10MPAA Rating: not ratedMy Rating: Ages 8 and up (terror, some violence)</fullReview>

Don't let yourself be seduced by the colour and gore of Carpenters inferior 'The Thing', this movie doesn't need it to scare the socks off you, and the performances are top notch from a cast you actually care about.A super-strong, intelligent and highly belligerent alien being made of plant matter is hunting and killing the staff trapped in an Artic research station, using their blood to nurture an army!Freaky Theremin sounds?

		<fullReview>The Thing from Another World is set at The North Pole and finds a bunch of US airmen, scientists and a journalist getting more than they bargained for when they investigate a space craft frozen in the ice. What is most striking about the film is its basic human story of team work, the pulling together during a crisis, this theme is a big shift from the short story by John W Campbell Jr. (Who Goes There?) Where that story and later John Carpenter's wonderful remake focused on paranoia and mistrust, this film is something of the "polar" opposite (literally) as regards the group in peril. It bears all the hallmarks of producer Howard Hawks, who clearly influenced Nyby's direction. The script, with its pros and cons of military and scientific society, is very much of its time, blending po-faced observations with straight backed joviality. But this all works in the film's favour and helps define it as one of the most important science fiction pictures ever made. Along with the other major sci-fi movie of 1951, The Day the Earth Stood Still, "The Thing" firmly brought the visitor from outer space idea into the public conscious. But where the former film intellectualised its alien visitor, resplendent with a message of worth, the latter is about terror, pushing forward the notion that the visitor here is a monster that wants to drink our blood and attempt World domination. No major effects work is needed here because one of the film's bright spots is only glimpsing the creature (James Arness) in little snippets, and this after we are made to wait for some time before things kick off. This begs us to think for ourselves as regards this stalking menace. Putting us firmly with this intrepid group of people, and we want to see them survive and we care if they do succeed. The low end budget doesn't hamper the atmosphere or flow, in fact Nyby, Hawks, cinematographer Russell Harlan and music maestro Dimitri Tiomkin, work wonders to ensure there's a level of authenticity to the Arctic base and that peril is never far away. Not hindered by many of the clichés that would dominate similar themed genre pieces that followed it, film neatly taps into fears that were to become prevalent as the 50s wore on. It may not be perfect, but a genre star it still be, so watch the sky tonight indeed. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Considering it was made in 1950, this is a really good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-- Minor spoilers - beware! --Too many people watch this movie expecting a modern-paced, pulse-pounding horror flick. These are the same type of folks who watch Citizen Cain and ask `what's the big deal?' For those of you who haven't seen it and are looking for a good fright, let me save you the disappointment and tell you that the movie is not all that scary. This movie, as old as it is, will have neither the dazzling special effects nor the shock value of a modern movie unfettered by the kind of censorship that was alive and well in 1950. The monster is humanoid and less costumed than the old black and white Frankenstein monster. You will not see body parts strewn across rooms with fans of blood decorating the walls. It's simply not that kind of movie.As for comparisons to (Saint) John Carpenter's version, I absolutely agree that his 1982 movie followed Campbell's story far more faithfully - till the end, of course. That said, even if director Howard Hawks had wanted to, there would have been no possible to produce that story on film in 1950, if only because the area of `special effects' was in its infancy. Watch `Them' and you'll see what I mean. Another point of comparison between the movies is how the characters are represented (i.e. the dialogue). Hawks' characters are intelligent and so is their dialogue. Carpenter's dialogue, while already dummied-down, is so stuffed with profanity that his characters resemble little more than a gathering of truck drivers. The viewer gets no sense of intelligence from anyone but Blair, and even he is reduced to a raving lunatic. Read the book, folks. It's not like this, nor did it have to be.So who should see Hawks' version? Anyone who wants to see a movie with a good story, quick and intelligent dialogue, a likable but unremittingly sarcastic newsman, and a bunch of army boys who, even in the midst of a crisis, still manage to poke fun at their captain about an event that haunts him throughout the whole movie. Film buffs and students who want to see a movie that broke the rules of the time and bravely ventured into uncharted waters should see this film. It set the stage for `Alien' in terms of its plot elements, foreign setting and the idea that the central focus of the story are the human characters, not the alien monster.It's true that, by today's standards, the movie is somewhat campy and simple. It's also true that the movie's setting, pace and absent special effects will bore the modern audience with its preprogrammed short attention span. This doesn't prevent `The Thing From Another World' from being a very solid movie where even the bit-players give excellent performances and - with the right frame of context and frame of mind - can still be thoroughly enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"An intellectual carrot...the mind boggles."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Classic, wonderful sci-fi / horror feature, a none too faithful adaptation of the John W. Campbell, Jr. short story "Who Goes There?". In this instance, the idea of the alien entity being a monstrosity that can imitate other life forms is jettisoned, in favour of making the creature basically like the Frankenstein monster. It's a super vegetable that requires blood for sustenance, and it makes life very tense for the scientists and military personnel at an isolated Arctic outpost when it's thawed from an icy imprisonment.With an intrepid hero in the form of 1950s icon Kenneth Tobey on hand, it's a guarantee that "The Thing from Another World" is going to be a good time. It was a fairly odd choice of material for the producer Howard Hawks, who fills the story with overlapping dialogue and a sense of camaraderie among the various protagonists. Unlike the 1982 version, where the characters had the means to destroy the creature but first had to *identify* who the creature was, our cast here have to improvise their survival.While any genre fan such as this viewer, who'd been brought up on the 1982 John Carpenter film, may be more inclined to favour that brand of horror, this is still very stylish fun. Hawks's editor Christian Nyby gets the directing credit, but it's generally believed that Hawks was pretty much in control of things. The score by Dimitri Tiomkin, utilizing the theremin, is suitably eerie. There are solid shocks, moments of suspense, and atmosphere along the way, as well as a lively finish.This is a film very much of its time, with our military characters very much a dependable bunch of heroes, and the scientists (most of them) treated as highly suspect, especially the misguided Dr. Carrington, played delightfully by Robert Cornthwaite.A little too much time is devoted to the romantic subplot with Captain Hendry and his love interest (Margaret Sheridan), but the actors couldn't be more engaging. Tobey, Sheridan, and Cornthwaite are extremely well supported by a strong ensemble: Douglas Spencer as annoying newspaperman Scotty (who has the honour of uttering the memorable closing monologue), James Young, Dewey Martin, Robert Nichols, William Self, Eduard Franz, Nicholas Byron, John Dierkes, George Fenneman, Paul Frees, David McMahon, and Norbert Schiller. A young James Arness, in his pre-'Gunsmoke' days, has great presence as The Thing.There are images here so striking that Carpenter was wise to pay homage to them in his film: the line of men encircling the buried UFO, and the sight of the burning creature crashing through the building into the snow.It's definitely a different beast, in more ways than one, than what we would see 31 years later, but it's solid entertainment for its own very good reasons.Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of a very few movies I would rate a 10. It's perfection was mostly due a Charles Ledera script based on the story "Who Goes There?" and the director talents of Christian Nyby and Howard Hawks. The cast was marvelous.The opening scene of the reporter Scotty walking his way through blizzard like snow and below zero temperature to enter a warm and cozy officers club is special. The beautiful soft music of the late 40's plays as Mr. Scott warms up by the fireplace. We get introductions underway to the main characters, pilot Captain Henry and his flying mates. A page by the general for the Captain and we are off to join a group of scientists at the north pole to explore a mysterious plane crash.Some of the scenes at the North poll station scared the pants off me when I first saw the movie. In between the scary stuff Captain Henry and a secretary Nikki added a few romantic moments, one scene with a band playing "A lovely way to spend an evening". It's a shame that the movie sound track had none of the soft music numbers that also played in the mess hall scenes.A great ending had me "looking at the skies" for years after.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguably the best science fiction thriller of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After more than 60 years, The Thing From Another World still rules as one of the tightest, most thrilling, most iconic science films ever made--and on a shoestring budget too. For starters, it's a first-rate action flick that can hold its own against adventure films of any type. The direction: it's pace, intensity, and overlapping dialogue, has Howard Hawks written all over it. It's been argued forever how much of the film Hawks himself personally directed. Regardless, Christian Nyby was channeling Hawks all the way.The film has no top-rank stars, yet over a dozen well recognized character actors deliver some of the best work of their lives. The very fact that this isn't the typical hero film with a bunch of third-string supporting characters simply serving as a backdrop for chasing the monster and winding up with the girl sets this work apart from the rest. The score and cinematography are also standouts despite the focus on the tight ensemble of actors and their quickly evolving relationship within the story. Is there a film school that doesn't use this effort as a sterling example of how economy of approach can yield impact on the screen? I doubt it.I watch this gem at least once a year and never tire of it. There will never be another quite like it. Still, what if Dr. Carrington hid away a few seed pods that Captain Hendry's men missed? What if the good doctor's granddaughter, a brilliant scientist in her own right, found them and her grandfather's notes? Dare we hope for a sequel from the hand of a young director who could do justice to the original? It might just be the ultimate challenge for a new talent ready to make history. Just please don't cast Keanu Reeves as Capt. Hendry's grandson! He couldn't touch Michael Rennie and he can't touch Kenneth Tobey either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated gem!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the earliest 'flying saucer' movies and probably the best. There are limited, but effective, special fx which add to the feeling of tension. The film was based partly on a story from the 1930's entitled 'Who Goes There'. The film's final credit 'Watch The Skies' became a litany for the 'golden period' of ufology in the 1950's.The extensive use of overlapping dialogue makes this a film that rises above the normal run-of-the-mill movie. This is something that is usually reserved for the stage and almost totally ignored in films where constant cutting of head to head shots make it almost impossible to do effectively. It is also a difficult process for actors to get right without umpteen takes?.something frowned upon in the days of expensive film. Usually only the star names were allowed to get away with it. It would also require lots of rehearsal before shooting could commence. There would be none of today's current "*sigh*?Take 24?s'okay, we've got enough now for the bonus extras on the DVD you guys!....let's make this one count?yeah, I'm looking at you Gervais?." One of the best exponents of the cross-talk art was Cary Grant, a veteran stage actor, in the 'screwball comedies' of the thirties. But there are no 'names' in this movie, just plenty of actors who know their stuff. Ken Tobey was always a favourite of mine from when I first saw him on the BBC in the late fifties in a series called 'Whirlybirds' and watched out for him ever after. One of those breed of journeymen actors who, whatever they appeared in, 'never knowingly undersold'?.as the expression goes.The first time I saw this movie was back in 1971 when the three British TV channels (BBC1, BBC2 &amp; ITV) used to close down around 10.30 or 11 at night. But occasionally, BBC2 used to show a series of movies of a particular genre till well after midnight. Heady stuff for those who would normally go to bed when the National Anthem was played. It was a series of sci-fi movie classics like (I'm relying on memory here) 'Destination Moon', 'Quatermass', 'Red Planet Mars', 'Fiend Without A Face', 'Forbidden Planet', 'X-The Unknown' and of course, 'The Thing from Another World ' that kept me up late on Saturday nights.'The Thing from Another World' was what got me interested in watching the skies and reading up on UFO's etc., something that has never left me yet. It is a simple, clever and very effective film in the way it racks up the tension and while the monster may be a little 'hokey', the film, as a whole, does not disappoint. The 'fire' scene in particular is very well done.I have been trying to get younger members of my family to watch this film but have been unsuccessful due to them having seen the remake and even though I have a colourised version, more ominously, "?it's still a black and white movie?don't watch any black and white films?"Whilst I can watch and enjoy the likes of 'Lord of the Rings Trilogy and 'Battleship' etc., and marvel at the cgi, 'they' want it all spread out on a plate for them?.so they don't have to use their imagination. Poor saps!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Of The Nineteen-Fifties Si-Fi Movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christian Nyby's (or should that be Howard Hawks?) "The Thing from Another World" (1951) is probably the best of the nineteen-fifties alien invasion films that went down a storm in America. The film builds tension slowly, and after a slow start, really begins with the discovery of the flying-saucer trapped beneath the ice. From now on, the film is exceptionally-well crafted. The "Thing" is shown only twice, which minimises any of the special-effects from dating. Sences such as the "Thing" running away into the snow on fire and being attacked by dogs and the excellent climax, are brilliantly well done. Christian Nyby gets the director credit, but this is plainly a Howard Hawks film. He helped write the screenplay, supervise the whole making of the film and produced it, it is safe to say it is a Hawks movie. All his trademark elements are there: the tightly-knit group, the strong heroin and overlapping dialogue make this film a absolute joy to behold and watch. A definite must-see film.</fullReview>

Hendry. The added chemistry between Toby and the leading lady adds complexity and relief to the overall tenseness of the film. The eccentric,yet driven Dr Carrington is the perfect fuzzy headed PhD who cant get past his own science minded yet myopic view of the entire situation.

		<fullReview>I first saw this as a kid in one of those grade "Z" re-run movie houses that as far as I know, no longer exist in the USA. Very scary and certain scenes really creeped me out.As a child of it's time, this movie placed the fear of invasion (commies were EVERYWHERE!!), current events (flying saucers..and Roswell was only a few years prior), the glorious military (we beat Hitler and Tojo) and I thought Dr. Carrington was like Nevelle Chamberlin-an appeaser.Nyby (or Hawkes) knew that NOT showing you something was scarier than showing it. If you show it directly you think "ok, now I know what I'm dealing with, I can handle that". That scene at the beginning where the guys spread out to determine the size and shape of what's buried beneath the ice is classic..."ya know...it's almost".."yeah...round.."..."we finally got one!!!...we got a flying saucer!!"! The "brilliant" military decides to melt it out with thermite and accidentally blows it up.....but finds a survivor. You never really see the alien body encased in ice....never really see it for the rest of the film. But you do get clues. "It" is a vegetable, and judging by when Dr. Carrington tries to make peace, about 7' tall, and lives on blood.All through this is some music played on an instrument I never heard before: a theremin. Very creepy and used in several sci-fi movies of the 1950's and TV's Outer Limits of the '60's. For an amazing documentary of Leon Theremin see 1993's "Theremin: An Electronic Odyssey"..it comes off like a cold war thriller and Theremin was the ancestor of the Moog/Arp synthesizer's of today.The sudden shocks, like when the men open the door to the lab and find "The Thing" standing in the doorway is reported as real....the cast didn't know. I love that sort of thing!! All in all a classic for the "hawks" to sorta counter the "doves" "The Day the Earth Stood Still"....100% on the creep-o-meter!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My father served in the Navy during the Korean War. He told me that one night on the ship they showed "The Thing from Another World," and at the scene where a door is opened to reveal the monster standing on the threshold, an entire roomful of hardbitten American sailors screamed like teenaged girls. I'm not sure that would happen today, although the scene still provides a good shock if you're not expecting it, but Howard Hawks' film of "The Thing" is still one of the first and easily one of the best of the 1950s monster movies. Smart dialogue and good acting lift it above all the others (except perhaps "Them!").Hawks (and the consensus is that the film was principally directed by Hawks himself, not by Christian Nyby, an editor who needed a director's credit on his resume) maintains suspense in the most simple and effective way: instead of constantly cutting away to show us what the monster is up to or where it is, Hawks keeps us with the band of soldiers and scientists trying to find it and destroy it, so that we don't know any more than they do. John Carpenter in his remake over a quarter-century later provides more special effects, but he doesn't hold the suspense as well.The characters are well-fleshed-out stereotypes, and the film is as fine a display of good ensemble acting as you'll see in any film, let alone a monster film. For me, that's what makes the movie watchable many time over. And it's what makes "The Thing from Another World" a good film rather than a guilty pleasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Cold War Horror Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any student of film needs to watch this classic. Although Christain Nyby is credited as director, Howard Hawks stylistic control is all over this picture. Many have discussed this point, so I'll just mention Hawks gave the director credit to his long time collaborator Nyby. Interlocking and overlapping dialog. Quick cuts. Muddy views on leadership. Astounding changes in tempo. Some of the best action scenes before James Cameron's arrival in the 80's. Classic Hawks.What makes this such a great movie is the way Hawks builds up to crescendos to create conflict between reason (the scientists) and primal self-preservation (the military). He also does this with a great cast of character actors. Hawks never needs to use a classic actor (Lauren Bacall) or screen idol (Gary Cooper) to carry this film. Another sign of great direction.The script is a 50% adaptation of the original story (preserved in the classic John Carpeter version). The Thing in this case is less trickster that just head-on, cold and determined evil. The level of cold war paranoia permeates this film. As you watch this film, check for all the plot devices later used in films like Aliens, Star Trek and Halloween. Great suspense, no gore. The perfect Halloween line-up. Bodysnatchers, The Thing, Them and The Day the Earth Stood Still.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Thing(from another world)" is everything a movie should be. The acting is first-rate and carries the movie instead of the special effects. The dialogue is witty, the music is stirring and the direction is outstanding. Kenneth Tobey is an Air Force Captain who leads his crew to a scientific outpost where an aircraft of some type has crashed. It turns out that the aircraft is an alien spaceship. It's occupant was blown free of the craft while trying to free the spaceship from the ice. The Thing(James Arness) is freed and starts a reign of terror. This is such a great movie that I don't want to say anymore in case I give away too much. If you see only one Sci-Fi/Horror movie from the 1950s, this is the one you want to see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beware of unknown frozen objects in the ice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of soldiers manning a base in the middle of the polar wilderness confront an unknown alien and engage in a struggle. Nobody knows why this alien creature is there, nor is this creature particularly interested in engaging in peaceful dialogue. All these soldiers know is that it's them against IT, and they can't afford to lose because if they do, all humanity may be doomed. The simplicity of this story coupled with some fine acting makes this movie a science-fiction classic. Noteworthy as well is the presumption that the alien is an enemy and how the alien was discovered - frozen - in a manner to make humanity complicit in its own demise as the soldiers unwittingly free the creature from its icy tomb. Unfortunately, the audience never finds out the creature's story, but there was no time for that. Mankind was too busy defending itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you can imagine an 8 year old kid, just beginning to hear about Space and Flying Sauciers, seeing this film was a really terrifying experience! You must remember, this was the cutting edge of special effects, in 1951. There is no blood, no profanity, no nudity, just a great story, great cast, great music, and great effects, that scare the poop out of you. This film uses light, shadow and sound as a integral part of the suspense, the clicking of a Geiger counter, when the monster was near, or just a shadow in the hallway, along with Tiomken's music made you jump out of your seat. You should not try to compare this classic to the re-make by Carpenter, both are great films in their own right, but I don't see Carpenter's film as a re-make of this film. Holy Moly!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Exactly that´s the stuff classics are made from: good acting (James Arness from TV-show "Smoking Guns" plays the monster!), a creepy atmosphere and an intelligent plot! The suspense will make you bite down your fingernails for 90 minutes, there is neither violence nor gore, because the true horror comes from the unknown and the unexpected! In 1982 John Carpenter filmed a remake with more action, better F/X and Kurt Russell, but it has not much to do with Howard Hawks original! And also the spirit of the post WW2-era is totally missing, because this film shows very urgently the fear of nuclear armament or the things from outer space! In some moments Christian Nyby´s film even reminded me on Ridley Scott´s "Alien", the parallels to both stories are more than immense! But as Scott´s movie is nothing but good Sci-Fi/horror, "The Thing from another World" is social criticsm and suspense-packed entertainment in one! It influenced many other classics of the genre like "Tarantula", "Them!" or "It came from outer Space", so it´s a very enjoyable and important film, which is a must for lovers of 1950s terror cinema!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>24 Carrot (Ouch!) Moviemaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With 30 raves in the hopper already, nobody needs me to restate the obvious. Suffice it to say that both this movie AND the Carpenter remake are outstanding. Any Hawks fan can tell this is his work simply from the Marguerite Sheridan character; she's not so much the now-stereotypical 'strong' woman as she is quick-witted and sensible - a Hawks trademark. And thank you IMDB for restoring my sanity...for years I could've sworn that was Paul Frees' voice issuing from Dr Voorhees, but there's no onscreen credit for him. (You sit through enough 70s trailers, you start hearing that voice in your sleep.) Many people make the mistake of assuming THE THING is a right-wing fantasy, pro-military and anti-science. It's absolute nonsense, but as we now live in a time when any positive depiction of uniformed servicemen is seen as some kind of coded hate crime, it's pathetically understandable. (Note the Tobey character deliberately disobeys orders, at the risk of a court-martial, in killing The Thing to save his friends and possibly humanity.) In fact, the most refreshing and touching aspect of this tightly-written, beautifully-acted picture is the simple common decency and humanity of nearly every character. Even the nominal villain, Robert Cornthwaite's scientist, is shown to be misguided and overwrought, not evil. At the very end when the headline-hungry reporter, radioing in his story, protects the scientist's reputation by referring to him simply as a wounded participant, one of the soldiers commends him for his selflessness with 'Attaboy, Scotty'. Some fascist, huh? You put that scene verbatim in a modernday film and no doubt our more enlightened audiences would boo at the top of their lungs, demanding a pound of bloody flesh. So don't watch this expecting expecting the exploding lasagna of the remake; rather, savor it for its slowly mounting tension and deeply likable and civilized protagonists.</fullReview>

With smart, snappy dialogue that sustains the pace nicely, as well as taught directing, the movie builds tension effectively and keeps it going until the climax. One drag in the film, a result of Hollywood's compulsion to add a romance which obviously doesn't fit in this flick. Later films which copied this one's claustrophobic effect wisely omitted overt boy-girl themes. Otherwise a very fine sci-fi/horror classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without a doubt...a true science fiction classic. The Thing offers a great story, taut direction, good acting, and a chilling atmosphere all cooperating with one another to achieve the end product of one heck of a good film. The story concerns alien life found on the North Pole and settles in the station of people hiding from this vegetable-like creature known as the "Thing." The use of the North Pole helps create an atmosphere of claustrophobia, lonliness, and desolation. This movie is primarily what I would call a "Thinking" picture. It has loads of dialogue given about the relation of man with the universe, man with mankind, and the responsibilities to each or either. Two central characters, one the army major and the other the head scientist, wonderfully extrapolate and symbolize two different ideals of what the purpose of life is. The army man sees life as sacred and something to be protected at all costs, while the scientist willingly concedes the lack of importance in human life where discovery, exploration, and knowledge can be advanced. Before I get too philosophical....just see this great film!</fullReview>

A bit of trivia, if I may. In the final melting scene actor James Arness was replaced with a stand-in as the THING got smaller. The stand-in was actor Billy Curtis. (Star of the classic western "THE TERROR OF TINY TOWN"). I have three copies of this film, two on Beta and one on VHS. I am happy to say that the VHS copy is an original director's cut.

Howard Hawks portrayal of men working together effectively under stressful conditions is evident in this movie, add one pinup girl to the pre-existing tension between the men and there is a magical combination.

		<fullReview>In 1949, in the Officers Club in Anchorage, Alaska, the pilot Captain Patrick "Pat" Hendry (Kenneth Tobey) is summoned by General Fogarty to fly to a remote outpost to investigate something that has crushed on Earth. Captain Hendry flies with his crew and meets Dr. Arthur Carrington (Robert Cornthwaite) and his team of scientist and they fly to the location. They discover a flying saucer buried in the ice and they use Thermite bombs expecting to release the spacecraft. However, it explodes and is totally destroyed by the bombs. They also find a frozen life form and bring it to the research station. When the creature deices, it attacks the dogs and loses one arm. Dr. Carrington researches and discovers that it is a vegetable life that reproduces like plants. Captain Hendry believes that the dangerous creature is an invader and decides to find a way to destroy it with his team. But Dr. Carrington believes that the scientific discovery is more important than lives and protects the creature. "The Thing from another World" is an engaging classic sci-fi film with a good story that is the source of inspiration of the 1982 John Carpenter's masterpiece "The Thing". The differences between the military and scientific viewpoints are very interesting and reflect a historic moment of the American history when the military forces were respected by the society after the WWII and during the Korean War. Margaret Sheridan is a decorative but funny character and people of my generation will certainly love this film that has been released on DVD by the Silver Screen Collection label. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "O Monstro do Árrtico" ("The Monster from the Artic")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hawks' Men (and one woman) of Action against the giant carrot-man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't sure if I expected to like The Thing From Another World or not. Unlike the many horror and genre directors - Tobe Hooper, Ridley Scott, George Romero, Terry Gilliam, and of course John Carpenter - who all profess their love for the film and the influence it had on them as filmmakers, I came to this after seeing Carpenter's 1982 remake/re-telling of John W. Campbell's story 'Who Goes There?' I didn't come in to it with low expectations or anything like that, but one has to weigh the "It's a Classic" comments with the context of the time: there hadn't been many, if much at all, in the way of alien-invades-and-terrifies flicks; that same year Wise made The Day the Earth Stood Still, which took a different tact on how to look at the Men Coming to Earth scenario. For Howard Hawks and writer Charles Lederer, they wanted something that was about something elemental and simple: a bunch of men banding together (with one of the tough Hawks gals on the side as the Captain's love interest) taking steps to fight against the 'Thing'.But my question was, in other words, had it aged well? Yes and no. Yes in this sense: this film is really good at showing characters talking to and listening to one another. Of course it being Hawks, and it's his baby even if he's not fully credited as director (but if Christian Nyby directed this, so did Tobe Hooper on Poltergeist, but I digress). Over-lapping dialog, a little smirking humor and camaraderie in the face of a danger just outside the door (think Rio Bravo years later, or even Only Angels Have Wings), and the fact that the first half of this film is really just getting to know these characters.The over-lapping dialog isn't just some stylistic quirk, though Hawks surely used it more often in his comedies (His Girl Friday at probably the most rapid-fire rate of any of them, to the point of a kind of machine-gun poetry or something). In the case of The Thing, it heightens the realism, and Lederer's script (with assist from Ben Hecht and, no kidding if the trivia's right, William Faulkner) makes these characters' concerns pretty real and interesting. The Captain Hendry is just out to make sure his crew is safe, his orders go through, and when s*** starts to hit the fan that he has everyone in check and everyone knows what they're doing; on the flip-side the scientist Dr. Carrington is more about, well, the science, trying to study whatever this 'thing' is underneath the ice, that it's something humanity should preserve, regardless of the danger. And the banter between Henry and the gal, Nikki, helps add maybe not levity but just a sense that these two know each other well, get along, and there's a richness to their relationship that heads off the plot around them.If there is something that hasn't particularly aged well it's in the last act where the scientist gets into that state of mind we've now seen so many times, especially if one's seen just a handful of science fiction films, where Dr. Carrington gets into a frenzy about not killing the Thing. His questioning about being so hasty may be fine, at first, but it really gets over the top in the final reel. The other problem with the film may be more obvious but, simply, the Thing itself isn't that scary. The most surprising or just suspenseful part comes with the Thing is set on fire; how quickly this escalates, and the realism (yes, realism, no CGI folks) of a guy getting set on fire, is rather extraordinary - it was the one moment of the film where I felt any sort of tension, mostly as I suddenly became anxious as to what would happen to the human characters in the room.But it's easy to make jokes about James Arness and how he is, in fact, a Carrot-Man of an alien (his head is more Frankenstein-monster-shaped, but the connections the scientist character makes to plant-life and vegetation makes this clearer. But if the thing that Carpenter certainly improved on was the horror and the special effects and suspense, I actually wonder if he totally improved on the character dynamics. Again, it's still a "B" movie, and I'm sure Hawks knows it. Yet he has capable actors, with Tobey, Spencer as Scotty, and Cornthwaite and Carrington (maybe the moment I liked best is when he appeared genuinely tired, a man of science who needs some sleep), and there's real LOGIC to the characters' actions. One of the things that I liked so much was that people actually talked intelligently, with reason and in trying to find the best solution to something, every step of the way. You don't get that really with too many sci-fi or horror today, so that's very refreshing.An all-time classic? I don't know. But The Thing From Another World - which coined the phrase 'Watch the Skies' as if (or maybe just as) a parable to nuclear attacks or attacks in the age of the Soviet scares (though it's not really made a parallel in any specific way, the feeling is sort of general) - is solid craftsmanship and gives its actors plenty to say and do that isn't simply boring filler or ponderous exposition. Characters are constantly thinking and trying to reason; even the scientist, who may be the closest to an 'antagonist' here, has his points and makes them clearly before becoming a cliché, and Hawks' control of a setting and mood, of making it about the mounting pressure and keeping cool under it, is a pleasure to behold. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best sci-fi/horrors to come out of the era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon receiving a request for re-enforcements from brilliant scientist Dr. Carrington (Robert Cornthwaite), General Fogerty (David McMahon) dispatches a U.S. Air Force team led by Captain Hendry (Kenneth Tobey) to a remote area of Alaska. Upon arrival, they learn that a strange aircraft has been discovered built of alien materials to which they gain access and discover a giant frozen alien lifeform. They bring it back to their base, where a careless soldier allows it to thaw, and the crew find themselves under siege from the giant monster that doesn't seem to be able to be killed. Soon, Carrington and Hendry find themselves at loggerheads, as Carrington wishes to preserve the beast for scientific research, and Scott sees it as a threat to humanity and will stop at nothing to destroy it.I was surprised at how different this throwback sci-fi is to its much more popular and admittedly vastly superior remake The Thing (1982). John Carpenter's re-imagining is more sophisticated and memorable, but Christian Nyby's original, based on John W. Campbell's novel Who Goes There?, has a lot going for it and is one of the more exciting and politically-charged of the 1950's sci-fi's. Nyby directed under the watchful eyes of Howard Hawks, so naturally, this is a very American tale, and very much a product of its era. In an America wary of Communist infiltration, Cornthwaite's Dr. Carrington is portrayed as a maniacal madman, who is willing to sacrifice the lives of his colleagues for scientific data, whereas Tobey's Hendry is the square-jawed American hero, who sees the need to stamp out the threat before it can bare its influence across America. Obviously this is a bunch of nonsense from an ignorant time, but it cements the film as being historically and politically significant, as well as being extremely good fun.Little is seen of the 'Thing' itself (played by western legend James Arness - who passed away last year), which allows the film to build far more tension than the many rubber-suited creature-features that were churned out in the 1950's. It is usually hidden away with shadows so the film never feels silly, and really makes an impact in one impressive scene which sees Scott set it ablaze. It is a fully-body burn, something which is extremely dangerous even by today's standards. An un-involving romantic sub-plot between Hendry and Carrington's secretary Nikkie Nicholson (Margaret Sheridan) aside, the film breezes by and is very good fun, and if you can see past all the political nonsense, then this is one of the best of the B-movie sci-fi/horrors to come out of the era.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah the thing 2011 came out and time to dig back in time. So before carpenters became this one. So here I am looking a 50's monster movie classic.You know I get why yes it is the precursor to the Carpenters The Thing. I has definitely the core story about a crash UFO, the alien life form that terrorizes a crew stuck on an ice desolate place.Except desolate? Not really this is a 50ties movie and this is not really that desolate. There are allot of characters in this movie that it doesn't really feels alone. The way they go through the building, everything is more positive. That isn't bad I mean it is a really good movie out of that time. I just feel that carpenters gives you more chills and more a feel of well it is almost depressing! In both movies the crews have to deal with something from another planet. But there are some differences! This movie really follows more the classic monster path as spoiler time, it doesn't really puts people against each other.See that is where carpenters version really hits much harder. Who can you trust? This is way more like "we know the enemy an we shall beat it". So that is why it is more cheery.Is it bad? No no not at all! It is very good the film quality is very good, it obvious is black and white but it is filled with good lighting and you see things. Yeah in a way that might make the monster a bit less scary but hey it was the 50ties. So the movie looks very good, the sound is pretty good to yeah the voices can be heard well and trust me they talk allot in this movie. See that is again the banter it comes over like a school bus of girl scouts with on the side the grown ups trying to fix a tire.You know yeah in a way there might be to many people in this movie. As in that you are not given allot of time to get used to them. Neither are many dying, woo more spoilers, so really it is about character. About the problems people have with each others viewpoints. The invisible fight over who is in command.And then yes the monster, eh not bad looking! What can I say I like the frankenstein like mask thingy..mmm hey it is the 1950ties! Yeah it works I like it but I do say that yes carpenters is so much more scary.So I give it an 8 I just wish the monster was more scary. And more was done to really but oh well we have carpenters version for that one. In short this is not "The thing" as we know it. It is way more a basic monster movie. But the seed of a scarier is there. And the acting is top notch! So see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My favorite Sci-Fi movie of all time. It has the attention to detail that "2001" shares with all the suspense of "Aliens".What makes it for me is the character development, the crisp dialogue, and the superb script. Every time I watch this movie, and it must be over 50 times now, I can't help but think that almost every aspect of the film could happen, just that way.I also really love the interplay of the army, the scientists and the media. Character development is not at all overdone, or particularly stereotyped, like many films of this genre. The scientific premise for the monster is spot on. It doesn't require a huge leap of faith, to believe the plot development as it unfolds.There is a consistent sense of suspense that underlies just about the entire film, and it is offset by the cute, romantic and at times even comic, interplay of the characters. All the characters are smart, either intellectually or at least street smart. The dialogue moves so rapidly, that you really must admire the writers and director for keeping the viewer engaged. I love the characters because they are not stupid or foolish. Even the giflfriend is sharp tounged, and quick witted, verbally parrying with the captain as their romance develops.OK the monster, though, he is not particularly scary in form (he looks almost human), other than he is big and strong, he bursts in and out of almost every scene, in a way that keeps you riveted to your seat.The use of the gieger counters is a sharp way of building suspense, and the background music is pretty creepy. Iam never bored watching this movie it is just so well balanced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comparison between the original and the remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>http://screenscrutiny.blogspot.com/Initially I was looking forward to this study because from what little preliminary research I had done, it appeared that the remake might actually be an improvement over the first ? a feat so seldom achieved. The original was made in 1951, and tells the tale of a group of soldiers and scientists who fly up to the North Pole to investigate a disturbance that had been detected. They discover a crashed flying saucer, and its extraterrestrial pilot that had been encased in a block of ice. When the ice is accidentally allowed to melt, chaos ensues.The characters are what you might expect: The heroic military officer devoted to his career, his orders, and his secretary. The top scientist with every decoration imaginable who sees everything as an experiment, and the rest of the team including an eager reporter who delivers a wonderful though slightly clichéd radio broadcast at the film's close. The relationship between the officer and the secretary is full of entertaining and witty remarks, and is especially racy for the time. Listen closely and you will catch numerous innuendos rarely found during those repressed and censored times, as well as a tame yet clear bondage scene in which she ties the officer to a chair while she feeds him his coffee.What makes this much more then the cheesy, dated, melodramatic sci-fi movie you are no doubt imagining is that the film's makers are smart enough to know two things: 1. Special effects aren't as well developed in the '50's as they will be later on, and 2. Watching people get chased around an ice station by an alien for an hour and a half is almost always boring. With these points in mind, they never really showed the man-eating alien for more then a second or two until the finale, thus making the whole scenario much more mysterious and engaging. They also bring in an interesting conflict between the military members of the team and the head scientist as to how out civilization should deal with new, scary things. As can be expected the military wants to blow it up, and the scientists want to study it. This step from our reptilian instincts to the sort of intellectual thinking that separates us from other animals is well explored as are the consequences of each option. I won't ruin the ending for you, except to say that it is well done.The remake takes us to the year 1982, but not much of the plot is intact except the frozen location and the presence of an alien. Director John Carpenter gives us some great shots of the icy plains and glaciers that are really breathtaking, and the cast of characters is much more eccentric, although often inebriated. The beginning is strong, as the members of the crew are introduced and some mysterious occurrences cause them to go out and discover the crashed space ship. Surprisingly, it is the first half hour of the movie that's the best, and it goes down hill after the alien is introduced. Carpenter apparently wasn't aware of the points listed earlier, and while he did have some incredible special effects regarding the shape-shifting alien, he neglected to see that even Kurt Russell with a flame thrower can't carry a movie. Rather then building from the enticing beginning and leaving us wanting more, The Thing gave us the "more" and then some.Had they stuck closer to the original's plot and didn't change the nature of the alien, I'm sure they remake would have been much more successful. While they did a pretty good job the first time, having the added special effects and color film would have pushed the film way up in the ratings. In other words, in 1951 they were held back with in visuals, in 1982 they were held back in the plot. Had they put the two together, The Thing would have been much, much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The world of the 1950 was a world based on fear. If it wasn't the communists threatening us from here, there or even under the bed, then fear was created from the fertile imagination of John Campbell Jr. It is from such a creative story later directed by Christian Nybe and Howard Hawks that this incredible movie debut in 1951. The story is basic in nature, a " Thing " or space alien (James Arness) arrives on Earth, complete with interstellar spacecraft. There he is met by a combination a of Arctic Scientists and a Poler Air Force research team. Finding the alien alive but frozen, the Earthmen take and store it. However, upon thawing out, the enormous creature begins killing humans for their blood. Then it becomes a question of survival. The 50's film was both a successful Sci-Fi and Horror movie. The cast included Kenneth Tobey as Captain Patrick Hendry, Robert Cornthwaite as Dr. Arthur Carrington and Douglas Spencer as newsman Ned 'Scotty' Scott. All in all, a convincing collection which established this entry in the annals of the Sci-Fi world and thus endures for generations as a true Classic. **** Great stuff, easily recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a lot to like about this early piece of "flying saucer" fiction. The basic story is pretty simple and straightforward. Something - a plane or ?????!!!!! - has crash-landed near the North Pole, and a group of Air Force personnel are sent to investigate. They team up with a group of scientists and gradually begin to unfold the mystery about what this is, leading up to the final battle with the alien creature.Director Christian Nyby did an excellent job of building the plot slowly but deliberately. This was interesting from the beginning, building up to pretty exciting and at times even a bit scary. I actually jumped a little bit at the first view of the creature when the door was flung open and it was standing on the other side. There are a number of sub- plots going on which, far from distracting to the main story, actually made this even more enjoyable. The whole military vs. science angle was important to the story, but never took over. At first I thought the quasi-romantic relationship between Nikki and Capt. Hendry was going to be an unnecessary adjunct to the story. In the end, it might indeed have been "unnecessary," but it also added a somewhat lighter touch, and became the source of a lot of teasing between Hendry and his men which gave this a very realistic feel. That's one of the best things about this, in fact. All the performances (and therefore all the characters) were very natural and therefore believable. The one exception to that (there has to be one to prove the rule, after all) was perhaps Dr. Carrington. Although I could understand his motivation, he came across to me as too unwilling to acknowledge the potential threat represented by "the thing." I would have liked a more imaginative explanation for "the thing" being thawed out. Having someone accidentally throw a plugged-in electric blanket over the block of ice the creature was encased in seemed overly simplistic."The thing" was an interesting creature composed of vegetable matter, and not especially frightening in appearance, looking basically human, although, as I mentioned, the initial view of it is sudden and unexpected and does cause a start. This movie may be best known for the fact that "The Thing" was a very early role for James Arness, but it was a completely non-speaking role which didn't demand much in terms of acting except to stand and look threatening, and to throw a lot of things around, and you can't recognize Arness under the make-up. The isolated setting is used to pretty good effect, and the sets, while nothing special, had a feel of authenticity about them. This is definitely a fun movie with believable characters. 8/10</fullReview>

'' . Which John Carpenter was able to present with the advent of special effects and cg effectively .''The Thing from Another World '' had no such effects at its disposal but still manages to be an effective sci-fi classic .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think anyone screams in 'The Thing from Another World.' Not even the women. That alone would set it apart from practically every other sci-fi/horror film of the 1950's. But it's different in other ways. It takes a decidedly non-hysterical approach to the idea of finding a being from another planet alive, frozen in ice near the North Pole. The being is extremely dangerous, as it proves in a couple of remarkably well-staged and believable scenes. The Air Force crew that discovered it and who for a time, are trapped with it at an isolated Arctic station, are all business when it comes to dealing with the creature and tend to show the kind of annoyance one might associate with the soldiers in, say, 'Objective- Burma!' rather than shock and fright. Hence, no screaming. Howard Hawks produced (and, some say, directed) 'The Thing' and he brings with him his trademark style of 'overlapping' dialogue. That is, in order to make characters and situations more realistic, they speak in fast clips and constantly cut in on others' dialogue; the way, supposedly, people do in real life. The fact that it is noticeable tells me it's not completely effective. I think the problem with the technique is that it's used too much. It would have been better to have a mix of traditional phrasing and overlapping because that more closely resembles how people really talk. The other problem with the script, somewhat related to the first, is that everyone is extremely cavalier about the danger they're in. It's one thing to be dismissive of a far-fetched threat before it occurs, but once the creature is seen and there is ample evidence of its destructive capabilities, it just seems silly for the characters to act as though their biggest concern is running out of coffee. At one point deep into the film, there is a rather remarkable conversation between two of the principals concerning the danger they face, and someone just walking into a screening at that point might think they were talking about a pet that wasn't housebroken. But there is a lot too that is right about 'The Thing.' It is fast-paced with interesting characters and situations, excellent special effects for its time, and the cast is uniformly fine, including Kenneth Tobey and Margaret Sheridan as an Air Force captain and secretary, respectively, who are kinda sorta in love. But if the characters aren't scared, we sure are, particularly in one scene where a geiger counter tips them off that the creature is approaching and they all fall back to a room, wondering how to kill or injure it. They finally decide on fire, so they fill buckets with kerosene and next thing you know, here comes the creature through a door, the lights go out, and we see it set afire. It's a fantastic scene, built up to so quickly and unexpectedly, and staged so intensely, we barely have time to catch our collective breath before it's over, the final shot showing the being, still on fire, running off into the freezing Arctic night. 'The Thing from Another World' is like that, always another ace up its sleeve, right up to the end. One of RKO's best, for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Sci-Fi Suspense; Dated but still Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Thing" is a classic Sci-Fi Suspense flick that may seem tame today but was the inspiration for much later science fiction films, in particular "Alien", "Invasion of the Body Snatchers", even "Halloween". Certainly "The Thing" has its dated moments. Some of the flirtatious exchanges between Magaret Sheridan and Kenneth Toby might make you cringe a little, and the portrayal of the head scientist as an emotionless workaholic may be a little bit cliché. And of course the reporter's outburst "We've found a flying saucer!" might get a few more chuckles today than in 1951. Given these few shortcomings, it is still a very watchable and enjoyable viewing experience and brings us back to the early days of Sci-Fi films which were mostly slotted as B-movies for the Saturday afternoon double features. The science fiction genre was not considered as important in the 1950's as today and regarded more for comic-book reading kids than mainstream audiences. It would still be 25 years before the premiere of Star Wars legitimized Sci-Fi for a wider audience.Directed by Howard Hawkes, "The Thing" does a good job of not revealing too much too soon. Even at the beginning, only sparse hints are made as to what will be found or what the story is about. Only gradually does the story unfold its secrets and allow "The Thing" to come into existence. Briefly, the setting is an outpost/research lab in the arctic with scientists and military personnel. There, a strange vehicle buried thousands of years in the ice is discovered. Amidst the wreckage, a humanoid "thing" is found, still entombed in ice, and the men bring it back to the outpost for study before it escapes.The plot is based on the novelette "Who Goes There" by the classic SF and mystery writer John W. Campbell in the 1930's. The original story literally reeks of pulp noir as Campbell describes the stench of the outpost to begin his tale. This makes sense as Campbell was as much a noir writer as a sci-fi writer. And this may be where the movie falls just a little bit short. The original prose evokes shadows, stench, and darkened doorways, in a way that the 1951 film does not quite achieve. Occasionally, the characters seem a little too matter-of-fact about the strange visitor that has entered their lives. Maybe I wanted just a little more of the claustrophobic and darkened feel that makes Alien such an excellent film. And maybe a little more horrific emotions.Still, "The Thing" is a good film with interesting moments, and James Arness as the creature is worth the price of admission. And certainly an absolute must for fans of the sci-fi and horror genres. And again, this film led the way for later science fiction offerings, without which the genre would not be what it is today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most popular sci-fi movies from the 50's, a title that probably inspired many subsequent masterpieces of that genre such as "Alien".A strange spaceship has crashed in the North Pole, and a group of men (soldiers and scientific) will find there a creature that will make them pass such a hard time.The director does his job very well, he lets us discover the monster gradually, just as it should always be. We got the typical characters of this kind of stories: the tough guy, the intellectual one, the brave girl which has had an affair with the tough guy... you know the rest. It's not as disturbing and scary as "Alien" but you have to take into account that "The thing from another world" was filmed in 1951 with such a lack of means.*My rate: 7/10</fullReview>

It is not one of those cheap exploitation pictures that cashed in on the publics fear of atomic energy, no, this film actually takes itself seriously and manages to scare the hell out of the audience in the process. So many future sci-fi/horror movies were influenced by this one, most notably the original "Alien". Gorgeous production design and great performances help to carry the story along, a story that concerns an isolated arctic base and the people there who have to deal with a very unwelcome visitor. Definitely holds your suspense throughout. The zenith of all horror movies to come out of the fifties</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thing (From Another World)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the finest of all 1950's science fiction films, THE THING, based on John W. Campbell's 1930's short story, WHO GOES THERE, stands as a classic in the genre of science fiction horror. Moreover, it was a film that set the formula trend for most of the era's science fiction---the enmity between science opting for "research" and the military imposing a final solution "through hardware"--a motif that created the road map for countless horror movies to come. Considering all this, one must weigh the ominous backdrop of the Cold War at the time these movies were made---and the very grim shadow of suspicion cast upon anything "alien." Much has been written about the politics of the "adolescent monster movie culture of the 1950's." But real world conditions lent their psychological fears to even science fiction horror. It is seen most obviously in movies like INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (1956) where an alien terror takes over human bodies; INVASION USA (1952); and surfaces even in a little boy's dream in INVADERS FROM MARS (1953). The fear and threat of Communism beginning in the late 1940's simply cannot be dismissed as an underlying paranoia in even the seemingly disconnected horror films of that time.Kenneth Toby gives perhaps his best screen performance as the chain-smoking, no-nonsense Captain Pat Hendry stationed in a remote military, arctic outpost. An unidentified craft lands in the polar wilderness and the men dig out a creature frozen in a block of ice. The conflict between Hendry and the research-driven Dr. Carrington increases throughout the film until the men clash head-on. For Carrington's thick-headed dedication to study the alien invader subordinates his duty to obey orders for the sake of the compound's security. This pits Hendry's need to lock-down the compound against the good doctor's obsession to "understand" the being that has come to earth. Tension builds until Hendry finally "confines" Carrington to his quarters. The men are left to devise a means for their own survival and ultimately annihilate the monster.THE THING is, however, not merely another 1950's "monster movie." It is a finely crafted script, continually understated, and a clinic for aspiring writers who could take lessons from the terse dialoge that threads its way chillingly through the action. Once the creature thaws out of the ice and begins terrorizing the compound, dramatic tension, anxiety, and paranoia rise to a perfectly terrifying conclusion. Not hard to see why audiences in 1951 were frozen in their seats by the unseen presence set against the stark black and white cinematography of an isolated polar landscape offering no escape.Even more interesting, "the thing" is never clearly seen until a glimpse near the end when it walks straight into the clutches of the trap set by the men. This is a departure of most all '50's horror; for what sold tickets in those days was the monster's explicit revelation, usually near the climax, and a sort of pay-off when its ghastly physical features were disclosed. In fact, studios like American INTERNATIONAL played a sort of one-upsmanship attempting to out-do one another when it came to unseemly alien horrors. The dripping mouths of tarantulas (TARANTULA), the stark white eyes of a Martian (NOT OF THIS EARTH), the swirling, octopus-like unspeakable mass hiding in a cave (IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE)--all went one-on-one with each other vying for terror and a market share. Today many of the old studio posters that depicted these imaginative monsters are considered part of a cottage industry art form--worth a great deal of money for those lucky enough to acquire the original lobby collectibles. The final scene in THE THING must be mentioned. It is a memorable one among Sci-Fic films. Radio contact with the outside world had been lost and it isn't until after the threat is extinguished that the base establishes communication. As the men in the compound gather around, a radio reporter files the story of the terror back to a listening civilization. He warns everyone "to watch the skies" --a sequence reminiscent of the final moments of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS when Kevin McCarthy screams, "You're Next! You're Next!" Yet it does not come off as adolescent; in fact, it works well as an effectively chilling denouement to an intelligently written and produced science fiction film. THE THING is a requirement for anyone who needs a sampling of 1950's science fiction. Who could give it anything less than four stars for its standing in the genre?Dennis Caracciolo</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** A group of scientists at the US Air Force Artic Base led by the Physis Nobel Prize recipient Dr. Carrington, Robert Cornthwaite, get really excited when they get the news from the station's radar that something, a UFO,crashed within 50 miles of the base-camp that came from outer space. The US military sends a squad of airmen to help recover whoever it is thats under the ice led by Capt. Pat Hendry, Kenneth Tobey, with news-reporter Scotty, Douglas Spencer, coming along. Dr. Carrington, and his fellow scientists are as excited as a little boy opening up his Christmas presents but that joy is soon changed to sorrow. Thats when whatever it, the UFO, explodes into a burning cinder when the airmen tried to melt it out from it's icy tomb with a thermionic bomb. Checking under the ice the group of military men and scientists see something that somehow survived the explosion. A Thing from another world. The first post-WWII major movie made about invaders, or visitors, from outer space that was released some five months before the similar "The Day the Earth Stood Still" that has become a Sci-Fi as well as cult classic over the years and stood the test of time that even now it still more then hold it's own against like-wises film today. Hacking out of the ice whatever "It" is that was recovered from the destroyed UFO the airmen brought "It" back to base to be examined and studied by the scientific crew but something went seriously wrong. "It" came back to life when it's ice encasing melted and "It" escaped into the night. Tearing apart a number of sled dogs who attacked "It" the airmen find an arm that the Thing lost in the dogfight and later the scientists begin to study it and are shocked with the conclusions they come up with: it needs blood to survive from both humans and animals alike. Uneffective by the sub-zero cold outside the Thing,with a brand new arm that it grew back,comes back looking for blood to not only survive but to do what it came to do in the first place; grow an entire army of Things to take over the world and use to earth's population as food.Dr Carrington even though a genius in the world of science is an total jerk in the world of common sense in not realizing the Things real intentions on earth. Naively trying to keep Capt. Hendry and his men for killing "It" before "It" kills them. Dr. Carrington feels that the Thing is so wise and intelligent, as well as valuable and that It's knowledge and wisdom would in the end advance and improve Mankinds knowledge of itself and the Universe around it. The totally out of touch with reality Dr. Carrington doesn't realize that all "It" want's from Mankind is it's blood supply to keep "It", and it's fellow Things,alive and healthy in order to enslave the human race. Spine-tingling ending with the Thing battling it out with Capt. Hendry men as the crazed Dr.Carrington attempts to keep "It" from getting cooked in a jolting electricity powered ambush set for it by the US airmen; only to get his brains scrambled by a whack of it's,the Things, powerful forearm. Unforgettable ending sequence with newsman Scotty reporting to the world what happened, via a radio broadcast, in this first and not last battle between Earthmen and Aliens from outer space. Scotty pleads to those listening in to "Watch the Skies just keep Watching the Skies"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iam of the opinion that this motion picture indeed is a very interesting and ultimately entertaining film.There are not a whole lot of side notes however we are indeed placed in a dilemma as to 1.our place in the universe,and 2.How dangerous is dangerous?The atmosphere presented as the film opens is very much as we as a culture got use to in the 1950's.The element of some Cold War ideology is real as we are at our station in of all places Alaska.The military, however casual is still the military and indeed orders are orders and in a relatively short period of time,a casual atmosphere albeit a card game is halted and a team of men,which includes a newspaper reporter named Scotti make off for a remote weather station manned by scientific as well as other professionals who radioed as to a occurrence or perhaps an event which is causing problems and remains still an unknown.The exact nature of the unknown has as yet to be determined however there does not seem to be any outright fear as to its origin.The film progresses with an aire not entirely given to the prospect of a visitor from another planet.It is an enjoyable scenario to watch Captain Henry as a throw back make a legitimate pass at Margaret Sheridan.It is as well one of the understated accomplishments that occur with the two actually falling in love and engaged all while being in the midst of this rather real or soon to be real,threat!This is very much understated and as suggested an enjoyable if in anything in passing.The film has a distinction of being a bit dated however to me it is what made it attractive to begin with and the use of thermite bombs to melt the ice where they have discovered what appears to be a body and a flying saucer is elemental by design.Its not rocket science but the music helps when they spread out and confirm the presence of a metal that is not ordinary and indeed are unable to at least initially place it.Though we are often confounded by the inability to place the unknown it is that element that prevents us from drawing a conclusion prior to knowing different and it is that that allows us to refer to this film as a classic because the build up is done well.The element of the unknown though has only a limited space and that is because throwbacks make mistakes too! The loss of the Flying Saucer is not the problem it is why in the world would you wish to bring that huge block of ice into your shelter and then in order to allow it to remain, I guess frozen, brake the windows.Why didn't you just keep it outside perhaps restrained by ropes and such but out of harms way and still frozen.However all up to this point is well and good.Here we begin to find out just how increasingly dangerous this being is from another world and it is indeed an intimidating prospect.The result of the encounter with the Sled Dogs allows a very real and different focus to occur and from something undetermined to a more threatening position.The counter to the alarm sounded by this abrupt change is led by a scientist named Dr. Carrington,whose position was unequivocal prior to the arrival of U.S.Military Team which was sent for as a result of the landing.Though working in tandem,Dr. Carrington believes that science should prevail even if it means sacrificing perhaps our lives and indeed his actions place the entire compound in a compromised state as he fails to provide critical information as the deadly consequences of this become evident.The encroaching danger reaches a type of climax when it is discovered that this huge carrot lives on blood and it is further determined that this visitor is not fooling around.They are indeed very threatened and the picture,its pace and all around provide for the increased sense of danger.The showdown is no fun and when Captain Henry says "ok you two,come a running".He is referring to the real attempt made by our visitor upon the very survival of this North Pole weather station.This is a very good film with very little in the way of special effects, however good story telling made this work.It worked when I saw this film on television many many years ago and it worked even up to today.A highly recommended Science Fiction film whose 1951 release is justified in it being referred to as a Science Fiction Classic.</fullReview>

A scientific expedition to the North Pole witnesses a crash of a mysterious aircraft, an expedition of US military is sent and finds an aircraft burried in the ice. An attempt to recover is made but as a result what appears to be a flying saucer is destroyed and instead a frozen Alien specimen is recovered from under the ice and is brought to expedition camp. Later in 1984 the film was remade by John Carpenter as "The Thing".

		<fullReview>This was one of the first science fiction films I ever saw as a child. The story starts out in a remote science station in the Antartic. A group of men find a flying saucer buried in the ice, and it's pilot buried a short distance away. They screw up retrieving the saucer, but they don't have any problems bringing back the body of the alien, which is frozen in a block of ice. When it thaws out, this is when the fun begins! Here's some trivia for you. See if you can figure out who the alien is before the end of the movie. Here's a hint. He played a major character in one of the longest running Western series on television. They did a remake of this film with Kurt Russell, but I think the original is the better of the two...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a classic (it rates with 2001: a space odyssey). The movie moves quickly from the beginning to end with no real "yawn" spots. The sub-plots don't distract from the show and present interesting psychological motivations. It will scare the heck out of you without needing the blood and guts of today's movies. Even Tiomkin's classic music score will keep you on the edge (check out his use of the theremin). A must for any science fiction fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Science Fiction that's logical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie in the theater when I was young enough to choke on my M and M's. Every Science Fiction movie I've seen since leaves me thinking I've already seen the best. Considering how much money was spent making this flic, and considering that the only actor that anyone can recall unless they are real movie buffs, is James Arness who was really a stunt man. Alien, the first, probably comes close to achieving what the Thing captured. But it was too sureal and depended on special effects. The Thing takes place in real time, on the earth. The isolation was provided by placing the setting at near the North Pole. People actually go there, not many but nobody has traveled to the Aliens turf - yet. The tension between the military, in the person of a Air Force Captain and the scientific detachment is an interesting difference of opinions. Back in 1951 Science didn't always make the right decision. The Captain, who may not have gone to college made the right decision.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE THING (as I always knew it, never knowing about the FROM ANOTHER WORLD) was one film that always scared the crap out of me when I was a kid. It's a sci-fi classic, and obvious inspiration for ALIEN and other similar films featuring a group of characters being menaced by a deadly unstoppable creature in a remote location. Sure, the alien isn't particularly frightening to look at, but keeping it off screen for much of the film is a great way of building suspense. The dialogue comes at a snappy, trademark Hawksian pace, Kenneth Tobey is great as the courageous, take-charge captain, and the sets help give an appropriately claustrophobic feel that adds to the tension. At times it seems that you can almost feel the cold itself. Though not as faithful to the original story as John Carpenter's 1982 remake (with was far bloodier and more violent but a good film in its own right), I never get tired of watching this one, whether it's the brand new digitally-remastered 50th anniversary tape or on television. Now, if only this great film could be released on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best of the Science Fiction/Horror films of the 1950's. The alien is not a cuddly Steven Spielberg toy, but a menacing creature that's obviously up to no good. You never get a real good look at him until the end. Like all of the 1950's movies, there is very little blood and gore. It's hard to make a movie that doesn't show much of the monster or what he has done, they do a good job here. The dialogue is crisp and very funny.The only problem is that this movie runs 87 minutes. If you watch it on TV, you get the edited version. That version throws off the timing of the movie. There is a running joke that gets squashed and the very funny (slightly kinky for the 1950's) scene between the hero and his girl is totally tossed out. If you can find a copy of the movie on VHS or DVD, be careful. The commercially produced VHS tapes contain the edited for TV version (80 minutes).I found out what I was missing, when AMC showed it one Halloween night in it full and uncut glory. It was like watching a different movie. If you every come across the 87 minute version, grab it. You've found a gem!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kenneth Tobey became a cult hero in this brilliant film that opened with immediate cult status in 1951 and went on to tower above most in the annals of mid century Science Fiction films. Memorable. Today, a half century later, it still holds its own. It is an excellent story concept and with superb follow through direction by Christian Nyby, fine cast and perfectly lighted black and white photography. The only other Science Fiction that matches it in quality in the watershed decade of the 1950s is Robert Wise's THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, that released the same year, another UFO film, and one that underwrites the UFO phenomenon in human consciousness. Both movies are mandatory watching for Science Fiction fans. They remain unmatched by any genre productions that followed for the balance of the century.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I now view this classic, I can't help but to think "what was the fuss in 1951?" The premise of a super carrot visiting our planet seems implausable. Furthermore, why show up at the north pole? Wouldn't a sunny island off the equator be preferable?A super herb would need the sun to photsynthesize or certainly be more powerful. One could make the argument that in the north pole, their are more carnivores and a plant life form would stand a better chance of not becoming a salad.I enjoy this movie not for the preposterous story line; but for the simple dialogue, the team work of the scientists to overcome the adversity of a seemingly powerful monster. The cold and frigid milieu of the north pole adding to the adversity further intesifies this simple plot.An interesting and historical note is the line in the plane over the North Pole; "We come here often, Peary came here once and he retired with a trunk full of medals" (not exact). The point here is that in a matter of a short 42 years the unexplored has become routine. One can only imagine this cliche being discussed using John Glenn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is, by far, one of my favorite science fiction movies of all time. I remember the terrifying, bone-chilling visions of "The Thing" with fond memories and reverent dedication as being one of the all-time favorite "monsters" of my youth. I've either read or heard somewhere that Mssrs. Hawks &amp; Nyby originally envisioned more blood and gore, but ultimately desisted in pursuing their original concept in favor of the censor's recommendation of that era. In fact, I believe some of that footage still exists to this day, perhaps even locked safely away, or just forgotten, somewhere. Whether that footage escaped the fate of the "cutting room floor", I guess we'll never really know for sure.While John Carpenter's 1982 interpretation is more akin to the short story "Who goes there" by John W. Campbell, I prefer the original 1951 version even though both versions are similarly watchable. I also prefer the 1951 premise for "The Thing's" survival more so than the 1982 version's, it's far less complicated and much more horrifying even though it's less dark and insidious. I'll take simple horror and gore over ulterior motive based terror any time. In fact, I would have preferred even more encounters with the original "Thing" than Mr. Hawks and Nyby had given us. I believe the story may have been abridged to satisfy the censors' wishes as well, but that is only my theory. Either way, it is a true piece of science fiction nostalgia and a memorable film classic to me. Excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early sci-fi movie still delivers the chills...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand from some of the comments here that the remake of THE THING was much more graphic and detailed than the '51 film, but sometimes the power of suggestion is more effective in providing chills than a more literal rendering of them. Such is the case with many of the older films, especially among the science fiction horror genre which were never as explicit as what audiences expect to see today.In that context, THE THING was quite a sensation when it opened in the early fifties, really a low-budget B-film that achieved the kind of popularity usually reserved for costlier studio competition. It had no stars of major fame but it did have an unusual score by Dimitri Tiomkin, a composer who free-lanced and only worked on those films that he wished to write music for. His eerie score adds to the chilling menace of the frozen Arctic landscape where a bunch of scientists discover a frozen shape in the ice.It's an expert blend of science fiction and horror, developing chills from the fact that the scientists have to fight for their lives when "the thing" is accidentally de-thawed. The scene where the ice is gradually melting while the guard has his back turned is still the kind of nightmarish touch that director Howard Hawks milks for all it's worth.While KENNETH TOBEY stars as the main scientist in charge of the expedition, it's JAMES ARNESS who is probably most well known to today's movie-goers for the many westerns he starred in later on. Arness, of course, has the title role but is never seen close enough for his identity to be obvious.This is the sort of science fiction film that became popular around the time of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL and the original INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS--and like them, it enjoys cult status as one of the best of those early excursions into the genre.It's slow in building up to the suspense, but worth watching for its overall chilling effect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Things were going along pretty well until Dr. Carrington's (Robert Cornthwaithe) discussion about 'The Thing's' unconnected cellular growth, and talk turned to comparisons with a super intellectual carrot. Right there my perception of the film changed, to be furthered by Miss Nicholson's (Margaret Sheridan) suggestion of throwing something hot against the creature in sort of a defeat by stew pot recipe. I only wish I had seen this film when I was a kid to give me a different perspective of it today, as it probably deserves it's reputation in the sci-fi genre, only I'm not seeing what all the fuss is about.Defying logic and scientific rationale on numerous levels (see FlickMan's review on this site), I myself was puzzled as to why the block ice encased creature was brought inside the camp building, only to have a window broken so enough cold air could come inside to keep it frozen - why didn't Captain Hendry (Kenneth Tobey) just leave it outside? Then, near the finale right after the defeat of 'The Thing' by electrocution, globe trotting reporter Scotty (Douglas Spencer), after all he must have been witness to in his career, just faints dead away!The best reason I can think of to recommend the film is the generally witty dialog and the semblance of a romantic chemistry between the Captain and Nikki. It keeps the pace of the film moving along briskly and keeps one distracted from the somewhat less than scary elements I had expected to encounter. Oh yes, and there's that eminently recognizable stance of James Arness as the titled character, affecting a posture that he would later get to use during the opening credits of "Gunsmoke".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In today's world young people are being trained to dismiss anything but movies with the most heavily-laden special effects. Sadly, youth assumes that if a movie slows down it will lose their attention. Having said that. SEE THIS MOVIE whether you're ten or sixty. Its slow boil compounded with great characters reached new heights in 1951. I first saw it in '69 at the tender age of nine and was captivated by its innocence and inventiveness.Who can forget Spencer, Tobey and Sheridan having a conversation and suddenly seeing their breath in the room -- a creepy way of letting the audience know how determined the monster is by shutting of the oil consumed by their heaters.From overlapping dialog that sounds so real to a feeling of desolation which fills the film with a sense of impending doom to the greenhouse scene where two men are hung up like meat on a hook (a centerpiece that is only discussed not seen) and a statement about men of science that still rings true today, The Thing From another World is a timeless classic.Let's face it, anyone born after 1970 isn't going to appreciate how important this film is. It's black and white, more cerebral than action and we all think the monster looks like a giant carrot.None-the-less, this fifty year old plus film marked the dawn of a new era in science fiction and deserves much respect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare 'serious' science-fiction movie from the '50's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face it, most of the science-fiction movies made in the '50's were utter trash. When you think of '50's science-fiction movies, you think of Ed Wood like movies with laughable special effects, a weak story and below average B-movie stars and persons in rubber-suits. Not really the kind of movie to take very seriously.But yes, luckily "The Thing from Another World" is a rare exception. OK I'll admit that the story itself is still quite ridicules at times. I mean, the alien is basically explained in the movie as being a large vegetable. It does make the movie a bit too silly and certainly outdated to watch at times. But then again on the other hand, "The Thing from Another World" is still very different from other science-fiction movies from the same period, in a positive way.The movie is unique and differers from others in multiple ways. It even in some regard was quite ahead of its time and it inspired many other horror/science-fiction movie later to come.The characters in the movie are all portrayed as strong individual characters with their own thoughts and emotions. It does give the movie a certain sense of realism, even though the story itself is of course far from being realistic. The movie also features a typical scientific- versus military way of thinking. That concept is not unique and is also still often featured in movie made this present day but the way that it is handled in this movie is extremely well and it does provide the movie with some tense and unpredictable moments.Also the way the 'monster', or in this case rather said the alien is handled is quite unique. The alien itself doesn't actually play such a prominent role in the movie in terms of how often and how long it appears on screen. The alien is never seen in close-up which adds to the suspense and mystery of the movie. Of course the look of the alien is by today's standards terribly outdated but that now has become part of the charm of the movie. The fact that he more often is off the screen rather than on it, provides the movie with some good and tense moments and also the moments that he does pop-up make provides the movie with some good scares (atleast for '50's standards that is.) because you don't really expect it. Kind of like the same way the tension in "Jaws" is build up.Another thing, which I thought was absolutely great about this movie was the dialog. The dialog fits all of the characters extremely well and helps to add to their own strong individual personality. The actors which portray them are perhaps not the great but thanks to the dialog all of them are extremely believable and fitting in their roles.The storytelling is slow yet the pace is high. The movie takes its time to build up the story and introduce the characters, which all yet again add to the 'realism' of the movie. The way the story is told makes the movie seem even more mysterious and tenser than the story really is. I also like the way everything in the movie is scientifically explained, something that most often in movies like these never was the case."The Thing from Another World" is an unique, influential and in many ways a movie that was ahead of its time in terms of character treatment and storytelling. Therefor this movie is a marvelous one, that will be enjoyed by all but probably especially mainly by the movie-buffs among us. Either way, a highly recommendable movie for all!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This scared the hell out of me as a kid and still scares me as an adult. The plot: An alien ship crashes in the Arctic. A nearby research station chips the body of an alien out and takes it to the station and radios Washington for orders. But a storm prevents communications from Washington and the alien's body begins to thaw... The movie moves VERY quickly (82 minutes), has sharp dialogue, realistic situations and (once the alien gets awake) is very scary. The direction by Nyby (or Hawks, as some people have said) is crisp and assured. The dialogue overlaps constantly so there's never a quiet moment. The acting--well, this isn't an acting movie. That said, everybody does a good job with what they're given--the dialogue is great, but the characterizations are weak. Also, the movie (wisely) never gives us a completely clear picture of the Thing's face...it's always hidden, glimpsed briefly or in shadow. That makes it seem all the more scary. John Carpenter's 1982 remake isn't bad either, but it's not as good as this. If you haven't seen it, do so! You won't be sorry. Just try watching it in a dark room--it really works on you that way!

		<fullReview>THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD is credited as being the very first cold war analogy science fiction movie . This is summed up by Scotty's radio broadcast at the end of the movie where he states that a handful of brave Americans have saved the day and to " Watch the skies " . What he really means that only Americans should be trusted to save the world and to watch out for communist infiltrators . Hardly one of screendom's most subtle messages With such an obvious subtext about fighting communism the producers have gone and shot themselves in the foot by missing out on such an obvious aspect of John W Campbell's source novel WHO GOES THERE ? and it's this : The alien creature is a shape shifting monster and can take the form of human beings . Worked it out ? The alien could resemble friends , family members and work colleagues just like communist agents would resemble friends , family members and work colleagues . For a movie that is trying to warn us about the red menace I am somewhat shocked that the producers didn't work this element into the screenplay at the very first draft .As many people have mentioned on these pages THE THING hasn't dated well , but my dad saw it when it was originally released in the cinema all those years ago and he didn't think much of it then , so I doubt if the passing of time has much to do with it not being all that regarded in the 21st century. It should be pointed out that a story featuring a plot of a monster walking about killing people wasn't all that original in 1951 anyway since Universial Studios had been making this type of movie almost 20 years earlier via FRANKENSTIEN , THE WOLF MAN etc and in those movies the audience did feel empathy for the monster unlike here . Though I guess if the monster is a filthy commie we're not supposed to empathise with itDespite some reservations ( The massive plot holes for example ) I do prefer the John Carpenter remake which stays closer to the original novel , a novel that ironically doesn't have a political subtext despite the shape shifting elements</fullReview>

First, it is probably better known today (2015) as the inspiration for John Carpenter's "The Thing" than as a film in its own right. Carpenter, by making his excellent remake, shone a light on this earlier film that it might not have otherwise received.But second, what a great addition to Howard Hawks' career. The man did gangster films, westerns, plenty of comedies... he is not, by any stretch of the imagination, known as a horror or science fiction director. And yet here he is. I would love to know more about how he got involved in this, something he very well might have considered beneath him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Anti-Communist Propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Structurally speaking, THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD might seem a little creaky nowadays, with its talky script and rather primitive special effects (as 'The Thing' James Arness seems rather pathetic as he is first burned and subsequently electrocuted). Yet it is important to view the film in context as a response to the anticommunist hysteria that gripped the United States at the time of its release. Producer/ director Howard Hawks wanted to alert viewers of the danger of possible Reds in their midst: in terms of the film's ideology, the Thing is equated with the Russians - representatives of an alien world that could devour anyone (and anything) within their midst. The fact that much of the action takes place in an isolated log cabin in Alaska is also significant: all the American forces are cooped up in the cabin by bad weather, and are perpetually assailed by the Thing; just like any ordinary Americans might be in their houses. Hence it is their duty to both repel and destroy these menacing forces.THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD also makes some important points about the shortcomings of science. Dr. Arthur Carrington (Robert Cornthwaite) is a brilliant, Nobel Prize-winning scientist, but he has in a sense been colonized by the invading forces, to such an extent that he does not want the Thing to be destroyed. In his view, the facts that that the creature represents new possibilities for knowledge, and hence extend the boundaries of human endeavor, are far more significant. At one point he insists that such goals are even more significant to the future of humankind than life itself. In terms of the film's ideology, he has allowed his 'reasonable' faculties to be overcome by the desire for knowledge. Although he survives in the end, his aspirations are cruelly frustrated as he faces up to the Thing, claiming that he is the Thing's friend; the creature brushes him aside contemptuously like a fly on the wall.The true representative of 'reason' in the film is Captain Pat Hendry (Kenneth Tobey), who realizes that to sustain the future of humankind, it is not only necessary to destroy the Thing, but to countermand the orders of his superiors as well. He is a pragmatist, understanding the importance of direct action rather than talk to guarantee future security. He has no time for Carrington's liberal perspective; the free world is in danger and must be protected immediately.Director Christian Nyby (with Hawks assuming a strong presence in the background) certainly empathizes with this view, as he has journalist Scotty (Douglas Spencer) conclude the film with a telephone conversation that is addressed direct to viewers, telling everyone to be on their guard against possible further threats. One Thing might have been destroyed, but there are many others still at large that need to be destroyed in similar fashion, preferably by those in favor of action like Hendry.This might seem a rather obvious device, especially by contemporary cinematic standards, to alert viewers to the importance of the film's point of view, but it nonetheless confirms the importance of the film as an historical as well as a futuristic text.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excellent old time science fiction/horror movie. James Arness plays the alien but he is not all that recognizable. An alien space craft crashes in to the polar ice. It is destroyed when they use thermite bombs trying to thaw it out. Turns out the pilot (?) has been thrown clear and is frozen in the ice. Of course the humans dig it up and bring it in to the warmth of their huts. So it has to unthaw or there is no movie. It does and escapes outside where it kills some of the sled dogs and drains their blood. It returns to the greenhouse looking for blood, is discovered but manages to kill two scientists, it hangs them up, slits their throats, and I guess sucks up the blood. Then of course there is the odd ball scientist that wants to communicate with it and tries to protect it. What a moron. It breaks in to a room where it gets doused with kerosine. When lit up it dives through a window and puts out the flames in the snow and runs away. Showing it's intelligence it cuts off the heat and thinking it will go after the power they all retreat to the generator room. They now lay a grid of wire so they can try and fry the creature. Gee guess what they do. Of course that stupid scientist tries to stop them, dies, and they kill the being. A very good old time movie.</fullReview>

While investigating, they are attacked by a unknown crashed alien creature that wishes to drink their blood and use it to grow seed pods of it's alien origin to invade the Earth.*Special Stars- Kenneth Tobey, James Arness.*Theme- The military sometimes wins in spite of itself.*Trivia/location/goofs- B&amp;W. James (Matt Dillion's Gunsmoke) Arness plays his first movie role as the alien creature. Filmed at the RKO Ranch (former) in the San Fernando Valley near the current Sepulveda Recreation area during the hottest time of the Summer with the snow (white sand) scenes. Look for the lead actors in heavy fur parkas to be visibly sweating.*Emotion- A enjoyable time capsule of a film era. Should be scene for it's enjoyable plot, drama and photography. It's the best and the first, but the remake with Curt Russel comes in very close to the original. The remake unfortunately relies on physical blood effects to stress the alien's ability to mutate and mimic a human being. *Based On- 50's flying saucers fears coming from U.S. space exploration race.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD (1951) is pretty much ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES! (1978) done with a straight face. Mutinous U.S. Army Captain Patrick ("Give me E.T. puree or give me death!") Hendry defies his commanding general to destroy all trace of alien life forms and space craft near their exploratory landing site at the North Pole--even though Hendry's being tutored by a Nobel Prize-winning scientist at his elbow. Hendry laughs off Darwin, military discipline, and his Constitutional Oath while spending more time dealing the lone young woman at base camp and acting impulsively on his craziest whims than he does paying the least bit of attention to reams of direct commands or his assigned mission. If Hendry had been a Navy S.E.A.L. tasked with taking out Osama Bin Laden, he would have married Osama instead, since with Hendry, every day in the military is Opposite Day. Unfortunately, this movie has such a low budget that the climax--Hendry's impending and oft-mentioned court martial--could not be filmed before money ran out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have now seen all 3 versions of "The Thing", and, by far, this solid, 1951, original version is the absolute best of the lot. There's no question about it.Yes. 1951's "The Thing" may not have had a big budget, or any wild, over-the-top visual effects to boast of, but, it certainly made up for the lack of these elements by its excellent production values, its well-scripted storyline, and its convincing performances given by a first-rate cast.I would easily rate this film as being one of the truly great Sci-Fi classics of all-time. More than 60 years later it still remains a masterpiece of 1950s filmmaking. This is the sort of horror story that relies on the unseen rather than the seen for its power, and, as such, it is almost nerve-racking in its sustained suspense."The Thing's" story concerns a group of Arctic researchers at a remote army radar station who discover a huge, frozen spaceman inside a crash-landed UFO. When this "visitor" finally emerges from its icy captivity the group of humans find that they must now fight for their very lives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many of the reviews here have commented that the film holds up well. It is a taut, well-paced drama without stupid horror stuff like people deciding to wander down dark corridors by themselves. Good, entertaining film.But it is much more than that. The context is the early cold war and fears of nuclear annihilation. The atomic threat had produced a general social unease about science. What other horror might the scientists unleash! Carrington tries to save the creature for science, and in the argument in the hall (with characteristic Howard Hawks overlapping dialog) he says "...we split the atom!" "Yeah, that made the world happy, didn't it?" says another. There it is in a nutshell.</fullReview>

How, why, where, who, and what kicks in and this movie will not leave you alone on all these subjects nor do you want it to. If you had a pre-conceived notion on how a visitor from another planet would play out, it is quickly replaced by this story and for the entire length of the film keeps building to a most satisfying conclusion with one wondering why no amount of money is being spent to bring us a direct sequel to this story line. I am okay with the remakes (not including the one scheduled for release at the end of 2011, but very hopeful), but here we have a proved formula, story, acting, and script that all line up and entertain you mentally, emotionally and psychologically leaving you better for it. It is the type of movie that has to be seen repeatedly because it just does not disappoint. It cannot disappoint if it tried either. For hours of additional piggy backing to the story line, what was "the thing" thinking..? It was smart, intelligent, resourceful, ruthless, and finishes what it starts. It is not immortal, but it gives as good as it gets with a few surprises thrown in. Stop reading this and go watch this movie right away.

		<fullReview>When a mysterious aircraft crashes at the North Pole, the egg-heads at a nearby outpost contact the U.S.A.F. in Anchorage, Alaska, and request a team of investigators with supplies. General Fogarty (David McMahon) dispatches Captain Patrick Hendry (Kenneth Tobey), Lieutenant Eddie Dyes, and Lieutenant Ken 'Mac' MacPherson to load up a C-47 and fly out to see them. A newspaper reporter, Ned 'Scotty' Scott (Douglas Spencer), is searching for a story when this happens and hitches a ride up with them. After they arrive, the scientists explain to them that the aircraft was not a meteor because of its flight path. Dr. Carrington estimates that the craft could weigh as much as 2o,ooo tons. They fly 48 miles away to the crash site and find the craft buried in the ice with what appears to be a stabilizer sticking up through the ice. Since they cannot chop it out of the ice, Hendry orders Crew Chief Sergeant Bob (Dewey Martin of "Land of the Pharaohs") to wire up thermite to burn the ice. This strategy constituted Air Force standard operating procedure. However, when they set off the charges, the ship catches fire and burns up. Later, the civilians and the military discover the humanoid body of an ugly-looking, 8 foot tall alien frozen in the nearby ice. They carve out a block of ice with alien in it and fly it back to their laboratory. During the evening, the alien recovers his ability to walk after the ice melts. It seems that Corporal Barnes (William Self) couldn't stomach the sight of the evil monster and draped a heating blanket over it. The scientists led by Dr. Arthur Carrington urge Captain Hendry to display compassion when dealing with the creature. Although Hendry receives repeated orders from Fogarty not to kill the alien, Hendry ignores each directive. Our heroes discover that their bullets are useless because the alien has a plant-based origins.The creature escapes and hides out on the base. Meanwhile, our heroes are snowed in and they cannot get any messages out. Worse, the alien presents a clear and presence danger. Not even 12 sled dogs could subdue it and they gnawed off a forearm. The scientists discover that the alien is an example of an intelligent vegetable. Indeed, Scotty refers to it as a 'super carrot.' The so-called 'carrot' proves to be more than a handful for our beleaguered heroes to contend with. The creature survives the lost of an arm by growing a replacement. Eventually, it kills two scientists looking to safeguard its welfare. We are told by Dr. Stern that the alien strung them up like cattle and slit their throats. Interestingly, this foreshadows the aliens in the "Predator" franchise. Dr. Carrington (Robert Cornthwaite) opposes Captain Hendry every step of the way. Carrington doesn't believe that the alien poses a threat. He tries to reason with the alien at one crucial point and the monster back hands him. Even if the alien poses a threat, Carrington argues that it is their duty to learn everything that they can about it on penalty of death.Our heroes engage in a brief fight with the 'Thing' and give it the 'hot foot' when they drench it with kerosene and set if aflame. The problem is that Hendry and company wind up burning down a room just to flush it out into the freezing cold. The alien exhibits some of its intelligence later when it shuts off their supply of heating oil. They rig up an arc of electricity, lure the alien down a hallway and zap him from three sides with electricity that eventually destroys it. Of course, while all of this action is transpiring, a desperate Scott keeping bugging Hendry about his story. Scotty calls the situation that they are in the second greatest story of all time since the Red Seas were parted.When Howard Hawks produced "The Thing from Another World," the Pentagon had adopted the official policy that UFOs didn't exist. Defense Department analysts explained that UFO sightings boiled down to three things. First, people misinterpreted what they saw. Second, most sightings represented a mild form of hysteria. Third, some sightings amounted to nothing more than practical jokes. Although the military and the scientists clash over the welfare of the eponymous alien, nothing which would lend credence to the existence of aliens survives in this taut 87-minute epic. "The Thing from Another World" qualifies as one of the earliest alien invasion movies in science fiction. It came out the same year that the more peaceful alien invasion movie "The Day the Earth Stood Still" from director Robert Wise. Altogether, "The Thing from Another World" ranks as a trail-blazing alien invasion opus with emphasis on pugnacious aliens. Future "Gunsmoke" star James Arness appears as the rampaging alien. Happily, director Christian Nyby confines the Arness alien to long shots so we cannot see exactly what he resembles. The cast and their camaraderie bolster this straightforward but atmospheric tingler. "The Thing from Another World" was derived from the 1936 novella "Who Goes There?" by John W. Campbell, Jr., but scenarist Charles Lederer departed considerably from the source material to create a crack jack B-movie monster picture. Like the traditional Hawks' film, this movie emphasizes hasty, overlapping dialogue, an ensemble of comrades whose temper their professionalism with wisecracks, and female characters who aren't scream queens.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film version differs greatly from the novella to which it came "Who Goes There?". However it does a marvelous job taking it's subject(space invaders!!!!!) seriously. This movie is one of the first to count on slow pacing, and imagination to develop the tension. No "in your face" special effects. James Arness is famous for playing the alien, however his physical presence is rarely used. Once the creature is set free by an electric blanket (of all things), the director uses the isolation of the frozen Artic to maintain his frightening presence. He will be back! This guy is lost, frightened, hungry and mean! The tension and excitement grows.Throw in humor, a babe, and a mad scientist and out comes a film I adore, and so will you!</fullReview>

I try to save my repeat "Thing" viewings for these snowy winter days, when it puts you in that "arctic" frame of mind.We can analyze every frame of "The Thing", and pore over the dialogue and directing style endlessly, but the simple fact is that once this movie ends, I could watch it again immediately, every time. I DON'T, of course, but I could. Only "Them!" comes close to challenging this film for the crown of 'greatest 50's sci-fi/monster movie', in my opinion, although I also tip my hat to "Day the Earth Stood Still", "War of the Worlds" and "Invasion of the Body Snatchers". Uh-oh.....all this talking about it makes me want to go watch it again...I'd better end with one of my favorite exchanges..."Scotty...did you get your picture?""No!

		<fullReview>After more than half a century this SiFi classic still holds up and is better over all than most others of its kind. I've seen this movie many times in both its original B&amp;W and colorized versions, always giving "the creeps".My only criticism (a very minor one) is that the Thing should have been more alien in appearance. Simple make-up appliances such as ear, eye and nose alterations (different than human appearance) would have made the Thing even more sinister and horrifying. And would there have logically been only ONE alien saucer sent to Earth from outer space for an invasion??None the less "The Thing" is a grippingly tense movie which includes not only startling images and staging but a haunting track of Other Worldly sounds effects. A must see for all fans of this genre. Mike Palmiter, Williams, IN.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Howard Hawks' "The Thing (from Another World!)" was one of the defining motion pictures from my childhood...I would scour the weekly TV listings to see when/if it would be showing on cable, then spent the remainder of my week anticipating the day it would air. Of course they never played it as often as I would have liked (at the time, even a network showing it on a continuous loop wouldn't have been enough), but I always treasured those Saturday afternoons when the RKO Pictures logo would fade onto the screen. Granted, my youthful interest didn't extend very far past the intermittent setpieces involving James Arness's towering alien, but I was entertained and fascinated all the same.I'm much older now, but "The Thing" still holds up extremely well; if anything, my appreciation for it has grown over the past decade. The characters crackle with personality, the dialog possesses a speedy, naturalistic rhythm, and the special effects are impressive. What seems to stand out more boldly now is the thinly-veiled sociopolitical subtext that analogizes an otherworldly invader with the 'threat' of communism (one of the closing lines even equates the alien encounter with a 'battle'). Even without the masked commentary, "The Thing" is a rollicking ride, even 55 years later.While purportedly based on the short story 'Who Goes There?' by John W. Campbell, Jr. (John Carpenter's 1982 remake was much more faithful to the source), the screenplay (by Charles Lederer) takes the isolated Antarctic setting but weaves an altogether different tale. A group of scientists and military men at a government research station encounter what appears to be a UFO that has crashed into Earth; they chip the 8-foot tall passenger out of the ice and bring it back to the outpost, where 'The Thing' is accidentally thawed, going on a bloodthirsty rampage. But this is not a rampage typical of the dumb monster horrors of the '50s, but one of purpose: the alien invader is a walking vegetable who sustains itself with human blood. The dialog used to convey these concepts could very well have been disastrous, but exposition is interwoven with a sardonic humor that downplays the absurdity without trivializing it (a nattering news reporter even refers to the E.T. as "a walking carrot").The entire cast turns in refined, studied performances and Dimitri Tiomkin's off-the-wall score (from clanging tambourines to experimental moog-effects) sets an appropriate mood that is solidified by Christian Nyby's effective direction. "The Thing" is a classic of science fiction and suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Holy cats!' `hey, it's almost...' `Yeah, almost a perfect...'- bunch of guys trying to figure out the size and shape of something under the ice. Imagine back in 1951, hot-shot director Howard Hawks says he wants to produce a movie about a giant vampiric walking space carrot that mews like a kitten. Movie fans are glad the studio didn't say `You need a vacation, Howie!' Instead Hawks got the go-ahead to make the first, and possibly still the best film about a hostile visitor from space. A team of scientists and military men stationed near the North Pole find a crashed flying saucer under the ice. The saucer self destructs, but the team is able to salvage the body of it's pilot, frozen in ice. This extraterrestrial comes to, and is very hungry, angry and powerful. The film begins slowly. Early, vital information is given to us by slow speaking scientists. This purposely deadens the pace for us. William Wyler said the best way to scare an audience is to bore them first. When vital visual information finally and barely shows (such as finding the stabilizer for the mostly buried saucer, or when we get a quick glimpse of the alien under the ice) it's something of a jolt. Hawks has us. When the alien (played by newcomer James Arness) comes in, we don't want to leave.  THE THING has many fun repeat motifs that drive the story forward. Throughout the film, all attempts to save pieces of the saucer or the alien fail. Any attempt by Scotty, the newspaperman to photograph the hostile visitor, constantly hits brick walls. Our heroes only distress calls outside the base is via barely working radio transmissions to a distant by-the-book military guy. Watch how many times coffee is consumed or offered amongst our heroes battling The Thing. While the walls close in, documentation and communication crumbles, energy becomes more caffeinated, almost volcanic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter's version of The Thing is best remembered for its incredible sense of paranoia and Rob Bottin's impressive, ground-breaking creature effects; the film as a whole, however, suffers from some fairly big plot holes, a largely unlikeable bunch of characters, and an ill-considered ending, all of which makes it a less than perfect viewing experience. For these reasons, it is the original that remains the superior film in my eyes.With a tight script, a great cast, smart dialogue, and top notch direction from Christian Nyby (with a little help from producer Howard Hawks), no thrashing, quivering, tentacled creature is necessary, and even the remake's paranoia is easily rivalled by the tense, well developed conflict that builds between Air Force Captain Patrick Hendry (Kenneth Tobey) and scientist Dr. Arthur Carrington (Robert Cornthwaite).If all that isn't enough to convince you that this film is well worth its classic status, then the film's perfectly timed scares and one of the most incredible body burn scenes ever committed to film should definitely do the trick (how no-one got seriously injured with all that flaming kerosene flying around, I'll never know!).</fullReview>

This one for the first films to have the actors have conversations like regular people. In several scenes you can watch and hear them have separate sub-conversations over one another. You see how one conversation splits into little separate subsets by other actors as all of them continue to talk at once.Putting the dialogue aside, the concealment of the alien is throughout the movie provided a heighten sense of terror to the audience.

The flow of the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat through-out. The ending is not anti-climatic. The idea of being from another world was, of course, nothing new but the idea of using blood to "grow" the invasion force was very much.. not the norm. But for me it was the acting. The "flow" in the conversations between characters. Kenneth Tobey and Douglas Spencer were fantastic together. This, in my opinion, is one of the best scifi/horror movies of all time.

What is most interesting is the aspects that influenced much later films such as "Aliens" (tell me that the corridor scenes and the way they barricade themselves in one area don't remind you of this), and of course the later version of "The Thing". The one thing that was both good and bad in this film was the dialog. The dialog was great because it really expanded the characters and the relationships with one another, but on the other hand it would be hard to imagine that some of the "playful banter" would be going on when they could all be killed at any moment by this horrible creature. And it is still a kick to see James Arness in the role of "The Thing". Overall, a great film and way ahead of its time. A Sci-Fi Classic!</fullReview>

Very good cast of this film pulls off a most definite winner. Should be studied by some of the new makers to learn class. The work with cold and ice was well done with most interiors shot at a ice house in L.A. Many other shots were stock footage of arctic research locations and the wonderful old plane they used back then. Keep an eye out for James Arness. This is one of his first pieces of work. I guess you can say size does matter. Lighting and score are used in this film at their best. Sit back and just listen to the use of the music to build tension.

		<fullReview>I saw The Thing a good 35 years ago and, even with my diminished capacity of being 12, I knew I was watching something special. Yet, I couldn't put my finger on why I liked this intense and claustrophobic monster movie, not until I watched it again as an adult in the early 80's.It's not just the natural intensity of putting a bunch of folks in an Arctic research facility with a giant and murderous anthropoid made out of lettuce (and an obviously Communistic, pinko-pervert, egghead, scientist whose actions are disastrous to the good guys) that makes Howard Hawks' and Christian Nyby's work so good. It's the dialogue, the fast-paced, snappy banter between the characters that makes the movie crawl out of the good and walk the halls of greatness.The characters are extremely likable people . . . and they are utterly believable! You've known all these characters in real life. That's why The Thing works so well.Now, go back and read some of the other comments. You may get frustrated by the brainless complaints about James Arness' plant man or some Philistine griping about black and white or the obligatory monosyllabic, uncapitalized, and obviously-written-by-a-Generation-Z-moron reviews that infest IMDb like so much fungus.Just remember that movies, even early 50's B+W horror movies can be deep, profound, and profoundly unnerving vehicles for social commentary.And they can scare the pants off you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Always liked the movie The Thing from Another World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "The Thing" in 1951 when it first came to the Loma Threater in Burbank, CA. At the age of 5, The Thing so scared the hell out of me that I vividly recall running out of the theater crying, and didn't see it again for almost 20 years (1970's). The movie is memorable for the monster with thorns on its knuckels, the stereotypical Hollywood portrayal of the naive scientist Dr. Kerrington (Robert Cornthwaite), the sexual bondage scene when Kerrington's secretary 'Nikki' Nicholson (Margaret Sheridan) ties up the Captain Pat Hendry (Ken Tobey), and comparison of the space alien (James Arness) as Noah on his ark, merely desiring to settle Earth with his planet's species. I still think it is an good sci-fi movie by today's standards; an excellent one for its day. I love to watch it for its occasional scientific inaccuracies. But the best 1950's era movie for geologic inaccuracies is "Monolith Monsters".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1950s fascination with alien invasions.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Thing From Another World" hit the theaters in 1951, when I was a small boy, and do not remember it from then. However, thanks to TCM I can catch up more than 50 years later. This is one of a number of movies which play on our fascination with aliens from outer space, traveling in, of course, a flying saucer. This one, however, takes a decidedly different turn, one which could have been developed further, had the writer the inclination. Not a very good movie by today's standards, still has some interesting elements and gives us a glimpse into science fiction of that time.SPOILERS. Something is detected near the Artic Circle and a team of scientists and military men go to investigate. They find what was apparently a flying saucer which had landed, melted the ice, then covered and re-frozen. As they tried to figure out how to retrieve the saucer, someone spots what looks like an alien being in the ice. They cut it out in a large block, take it back to a cold storage room until they get orders on what to do. Fatefully, a guard throws a blanket over the being to hide its gaze, and the blanket turns out to be heated. The ice melts, the "thing" becomes mobile, and most of the movie involves the men and one woman trying to figure out how to destroy it before everyone gets killed. The novelty is that the being is not animal, it is plant, so a ripped off arm just grows back. And bullets just make holes in it. It thrives on blood, much as a Venus Flytrap does, but this "thing" is smart and built like us. They eventually figure out vegetables can be "cooked", they try and fail with fire, eventually succeed with a trap and lots of electricity.The movie ends with a warning, "watch the skies", as aliens might come down to visit us at any time, and they probably won't be friendly.An additional attraction, for me, was seeing George Fenneman as Dr. Redding. As a boy in the 1950s and early 1960s we would watch the Groucho Marx TV show "You Bet Your Life", and Fenneman was his announcer and straight man. I recognized him immediately.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thing from another World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director: Christian Nyby, Script: Charles Lederer, Story: John W. Campbell Jr. (Who goes There?) Cast: Kenneth Toby, Robert Cornthwaite, Douglas Spencer, Margaret Sheridan, James Arness.I am going to try to be kind when I give my opinions about this film because in spite of everything, it is one of the first of its kind. Sci-Fi's golden age started with the likes of George Pal's Destination Moon and When Worlds Collide followed by The Thing in 1951. The Thing was the first of many alien invader movies to follow latter into the 1950's.This movie is about a group of air force guys that go up to the Artic with a journalist to investigate a possible meteorite crash. They join up with a team of scientists at a research station. When they arrive at the site, they discover it to be a flying saucer that is submerged under ice. They destroy the saucer in their attempt to recover it but they do find a body in a block of ice near the saucer. The block of ice is brought back to the research station. The block of ice melts while one of the guys is supposed to be watching it and the creature gets out. The creature starts attacking the men. He is discovered by Dr. Carrington (Cornthwaite) to be a plant creature with intelligence beyond that of humans. It becomes a threat to the people and even a possible threat to mankind so Captian Hendry (Toby) and his men try to figure out a way to destroy it. However, Dr. Carrington wants to study him and learn from him so he secretly thwarts their attempts to destroy the creature.Very good monster movie reminiscent of the old Universal monster movies from the 1930's. The cold arctic setting is wonderful and looks very realistic. This film is loaded with suspense. The monster is rather illusive so one does not know when he is going to show up. This unknown is what makes this move so suspenseful. On the down side, their is some useless filler in this movie. For example, the romantic scenario between Captain Hendry and Nikki (Sheridan). Also, when the monster does appear they never really seem that terrified. Lets put it this way, they are never as terrified as they appear on the DVD cover! Also, the silly one liners and jokes weaken its horror element. It gets too "talky". But overall I do like the movie and a 1950's sci-fi collection is definitely not complete without it. Christian Nyby gets director credit but many people believe it to be directed by Howard Hawks. This film was remade by John Carpenter as The Thing in 1982. The Carpenter version is much truer to the original story. As a film, the Carpenter version is more like Alien (1979) and Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) than the original Thing</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people may remember "Midnight Shows" which were films shown to those willing to stay up until midnight to see a movie! So it was with "The Thing From Another World." As a boy of 12 I accompanied some adult friends to a midnight show and was treated to this film. Believe me, I wasn't the only one in the audience scared stiff. This was a trail blazing film of suspense, excitement and terror. In fact, it scared me nearly to death! Imagine being trapped in a frozen wasteland with a vegetable-like creature that thrives on human blood. There were screams from the audience. In retrospect, seeing it was a genuinely good time. I went home that night and checked my closet to see if The Thing was waiting for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the earliest, if not the first, movies to use invasions from outer space as a science fictional way of urging a Cold War America to stand guard against the spread of Communism. And true to the Joe McCarthy spirit of the times, it displayed a deep-seated mistrust of intellectualism. But even discounting the political subtext "The Thing" is a tense, first-rate thriller, about a military detachment, one very plucky woman, and a group of scientists stationed at a lonely Artic outpost uncovering a humanoid alien being in the ice, who upon defrosting promptly goes on a rampage for blood. Certainly not as gross as the John Carpenter remake, the black-and-white movie resorts to simple devices for shock and horror, such as opening a door and seeing your worst nightmare standing in front of you. The American soldiers are red-blooded, competent, confident, can-do guys fighting for their lives while the bumbling scientists try foolishly to communicate with the otherworldly intruder. Although not credited, it is widely believed that Howard Hawks, not Christian Nyby, helmed the picture. Also there's a daring bondage scene that has to be seen to be believed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thing From Another World is one of the earlier invasion films of the 1950's and is one of the best. It came in the same year as The Day The Earth Stood Still and When Worlds Collide.Scientists at a remote research station in the frozen wastes of the North Pole battle a giant from another world (James Arness), after blowing his flying saucer up. He becomes loose when he is accidently thawed by an electric blanket. After killing several people, he is electrocuted to nothing.The cast in this movie includes sci-fi regular Kenneth Tobey (The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms). He plays a good part, as do the other cast members. Another good thing about this movie is the magnificent, eerie score, which makes it even more haunting and creepy.This is one of my favourite sci-fi movies and I never tire of watching it. This is a must for all sci-fi fans.Rating: 5 stars out of 5. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who Goes There?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, unaccountably attributed to Hawks' editor, is a perfect example of how much can be done with a modest budget, solid but not flamboyant performers, a strong and suspenseful story, and directorial talent. Hawks is not much of a philosopher but he is a superb story teller. There is, first of all, the general sense of overall solidarity between the small team, which includes the usual self-possessed woman who is quite able to take care of herself. She's given the trademark line, "Good luck to you." The chief conflict, of course, is between the "intellectual carrot" (Scotty, the newsman, seems always to think in headlines or sound bites) and the inhabitants of the isolated polar research station. The Thing evidently has nothing to offer the human race. He, or it, is not going to save us from ourselves or even make us the least sympathetic towards him. He never heard of King Kong. He's just going to slaughter us, drain our blood, and propagate. So far, so good. He has all the appeal of the Ebola virus. But there is the more interesting conflict, which appears repeatedly in Hawks' films, most notably in Ball of Fire and Monkey Business, between intellectuality and forceful animal drives. I avoid the word "libido" in deference to Hawks, who wouldn't have known what it meant. He received poor grades in prep school and Lord only knows how he managed to get into Cornell. He evidently never forgave the eggheads for giving him those grades because his intellectuals are consistently shown as pretty poor judges of right and wrong. Here, the intellectuality is represented by the resident group of highbrow "professors" (they call each other by that title)and the one played by Cornthwaite in particular, who seems to believe that maybe they're dealing with a kind of highly insulted E.T. But in the end, as is usual, the brains lose and the gonads win. Each time I see this movie I marvel at how scary a story can be in the absence of special effects and disgusting bloodshed. One thing, though, is bothersome. The writing, good as it is with dialog, has some factual errors. The professors don't know one geological period from another. And Tex, the radio operator, tells the pilot of the approaching airplane to keep listening and home in on his signal because he, Tex, is going to "leave the key open." What he should have said was that he'll close the key. To send out a continuous signal, you need to screw the radio key all the way down to its base, closing the space between contacts. But those are carps. Who cares about the Pleistocene in a good, old fashioned horror flick like this? They remade it -- of course -- with a multitude of disgusting special effects and a complete absence of affection for the material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An early sci-fi film that set the trend for many others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The question of who really directed this movie got settled in a conversation I had recently (summer of 1999) with its star, Kenneth Tobey, at a Charlotte, N.C., film festival: it was Howard Hawks, not Christian Nyby, despite what the credits say. Hawks came up with the "Citizen Kane"-like overlapping dialog, the ensemble cast, and everything else that made this movie good including never getting that good a look at the monster and letting your imagination work instead (F. Lee Bailey, now a prominent lawyer, ran home and locked himself in his room after seeing this movie as a child according to a biography by Les Whitten). Based on their recorded correspondence, SF writer Isaac Asimov hated this movie because some of the scientists were portrayed as not up to handling the situation, while the military did exactly the right thing, and because it diverged from the original story ("Who Goes There?" by John W. Campbell Jr.) in not having a shape-changing monster who could assume the guise of anyone. Campbell, on the other hand, found it a good movie even if it went its own way. John Carpenter's remake was more faithful to the original story, but certainly not to its ending. "The Thing" and "Destination Moon" came out close together at the start of the 1950s: the unfortunate lesson that Hollywood learned was that a "monster" science fiction movie did just as well at the box office as an expensive, scientifically-accurate SF movie, but few of the '50s successors to "The Thing" (except possibly "Invasion of the Body Snatchers") were as well executed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If Nothing Else, this was a First in many ways. Deadly Serious, this Flying Saucer Movie has Cold War Overtones, Horror Movie Conventions, and a Right-Wing Conservative Ambiance that is as Subtle as a Meat (Vegetable) Cleaver.On the Surface this is all Tension, Nervous Talk, and Suspense. It moves so quickly that it has no Time for any real Contemplation or Analysis as the Events unfold at an Alarming Rate. But, while Entertaining and Exciting the Filmmakers were on Thin Ice here. It was quite a "new", Modern Concept this UFO Stuff and until the Post War Years was relegated to Pulp Sci-Fi and Serials.But in the hands of a handler like Howard Hawks this becomes another of His Manly Male Attitudes about Machismo and a World not fit for Intellectuals, Homosexuals, or Commies. Just about Anyone or Anything that goes against His Way is bound for the Highway. Here the Scientist is Portrayed as an Effeminate, Left Leaning Nut-Case and is given Lines like..."We owe it to humanity to stand here and die", all the while wearing a Ruskie Hat.The Grand Captain is fawned over by his Crew that follows Him around and snuggles up like so many puppy dogs. He is clearly the ONE in charge and the Hero to the Woman, the Journalist, and Everyone else in the Picture, except the Creep Scientist.As aforementioned, the Film does Deserve a lot of Credit for breaking the ice, and is at first glance, quite Enthralling and Delivers the goods. But if you go much deeper into it, the Movie is not quite the Great Film many proclaim and is a Stark Example of a certain Myopic Worldview that Reeks of Propaganda both Political and Social.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Stuff from the 50's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was growing up we used to have a local station that had midnight monster movie every Saturday night. It was hosted by the station weatherman dressed in a cheesy vampire suit but nonetheless it was great stuff. The show never featured anything current due to a small budget so all the films were usually from the 50's. As a result I am still to this day addicted to the great Sci-Fi films of the 50's and The Thing From Another World was one of the very best. The film stars Kenneth Tobey and is about a group stationed at the north pole who uncover the frozen remains of a being from outer space. When they get it back to camp and accidently thaw it out, much to their horror they find the being is still alive. Once thawed the alien goes on a killing spree and begins to reproduce in its own fashion. Tobey and the rest of the group must destroy the alien and its offspring for the sake of all mankind. The film also stars Sci-Fi regulars Robert Cornthwaite who was in The War of the Worlds and Douglas Spencer who played the Monitor of Metaluna in This Island Earth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This version of the The Thing is flat out superior to the OK Carpenter remake. The original version captures a sense of isolation and building terror that the sequal doesn't even approach. I'm sure that todays college film students, heavily dosed on left-wing interpretative film pablum, find a lot of "HIDDEN MESSAGES" to sneer at in this movie, but they just don't get it. No gore, no splatter, no nubile beach bunnies with ripped blouses, no gut wrenching special effects (ala Carpenter), no insipid political correctness - just implied, building terror. Yes the monster is hokey, the Geiger counter use is hackneyed, the love plot is old news, but it doesn't matter. Turn out the lights, watch the movie quietly and tell me you don't flinch when they open that hallway door. Tell me you don't feel a little goose-bumpish when Scotty says "watch the skies!" at the end, or they spread out on the ice to define the shape of the mysterious craft.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw this film as a child, it scared me so much I had nightmares for weeks. Even today, it exudes a feeling of tension throughout as though something bad is going to happen very soon. The rushed, clipped dialog serves to intensify this.Although devoid of many special effects, this movie does not need them. It seems that Howard Hawks realized that the technology wasn't available and made use of psychological effects instead of visual ones in order to make a credible film. By the way, is the debate still going on as to whether Nyby or Hawks really directed?I thought the acting was excellent and all characters were believable in their roles. Several subtle issues were touched upon; the questionable use of atomic energy; the question of the need secrecy - military vs. civilian; the cold war; the role of science's need to know versus the safety of the individual.Filmed in glorious black and white, it captures a mood of fright and is nightmarish in its quaility. Dimitri Tiomkin's killer musical score is in-your-face scary and certainly one of his best.I greatly enjoyed this film even though there are a few items that were amiss. First, Campbell's story took place in the Antarctic, not the Arctic (Carpenter's re-make makes amends here and is truer to the original story), when they first arrive at the saucer crash site, the shadows from the sun always fall in the same direction no matter where the actors stand or the camera angle and when following the mushroom cloud, the camera catches a very quick view of some microphones and other studio equipment.All-in-all, this is a great film that was years ahead of its time. My copy is on laserdisc that includes some fine supplemental material and has some deleted scenes put back in. I believe Warner now owns the rights to this film and I hope they release it on DVD in the near future. If you want genuine scares and want to see a really well made sci-fi film, I highly recommend this one.</fullReview>

When I was a teenager in Brooklyn I went to the movie house (Parthenon Theatre) every day for 14 cents to see "The Thing" while my mom got her dish (they gave out dishes in those days). I remember the big sign they had outside the movie house mounted on the canopy "The Thing." When the movie ended at the end of the week I was very sad. Whenever this movie was shown on TV I watched it and eventually recorded it on VHS - commercials and all. When the DVD came out I wasted no time buying it. Without exaggeration I have watched this movie well over 600 times and I watch a bit of it every night - no kidding. I have all the older sci fi movies and watch them a great deal but not like "The Thing."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A major disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I realize this may upset a lot of people as this movie has a devoted audience. I finally watched it last night and I have to say, it's really boring. There is very little action, and not much in the way of characterization or dialogue to offset its glacial pace (sorry about the pun). Normally if a movie bores me this much I'll shut it off but because of its classic status I felt it deserved at least one complete viewing. Still, I wound up reading during the last half hour, glancing up only when something actually happened. It was very easy to follow the story while paying minimal attention.If you're thinking that I'm a young whippersnapper who has been spoiled by flashy visual effects and needs constant action, I assure you this is not true. I'm over 50. I see all kinds of movies, including "sumptuous literary adaptations" i.e. "Wings of a Dove." I grew up without TV and didn't own one until I was in my 20s. I am not a huge fan of "Star Wars" or "The Matrix" and my idea of a good SF film is "The Man Who Fell to Earth." I will admit I may have been spoiled by John Carpenter's 1982 film "The Thing", which is really another story altogether. I feel Carpenter's film is a classic that not only features ground-breaking visual effects but a mounting atmosphere of suspicion and paranoia that speaks directly to the meaning of Campbell's story title, "Who Goes There?" In the Howard Hawks story, you basically have a standard crew of 50s film characters having discussions. There is virtually no tension or atmosphere of any kind.If I'd seen this in a theater at a younger age, I might have loved it as do its many fans. But I'm sorry, folks; this one just never came to life for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great movie (in the sense of how much fun it is, at least) which really deserves better than the 7.3 average rating it is getting at the time of this writing.Released in 1951 - the same year as NBC broadcast for the first time the first documentary television series in history, its epic about how Americans practically single-handedly won World War II, VICTORY AT SEA - it shows as well as the TV series does what Americans thought of themselves at that time: the widespread feeling (still not entirely gone to this very day) that American toughness, ingenuity, and can-do spirit will win through and conquer all every time. The tone of the two is practically identical: there will be setbacks and losses, and even moments of uncertainty, but Americans are winners and ultimately winning is what we do (a mentality which contributed in no small way to the eventual success of the starship ENTERPRISE under its "I-don't-believe-in-the-no-win-situation" captain some years later). The result is that the question of whether "The Thing" can be dispatched before it becomes a Real problem actually takes a back seat to the question of whether it SHOULD be dispatched (show me another "monster movie" which does that!) So it is small wonder the conflict here is resolved by average front-line airmen (those most glamorous of servicemen) of the United States armed forces (I would have thought Air Force, except that the script keeps saying "Army") relying on their own resources and their own initiative in spite of contradictory instructions from "the brass" back in the "rear area", an effect intensified by the use of competent, appealing but decidedly B-grade actors (there are no A-list actors, even character actors, in the piece) -- just "regular guys" pulling together with bravery, journeyman expertize, and teamwork to get the job done. As such it is replete with the prosaic "barracks" banter and humor the optimize that kind of thing, withthe writers clearly striving to capture the atmosphere of small-unit military like. But lest the thing turn into too much of a war movie, here the civilian veteran war correspondent and the obligatory "love interest" roll up their sleeves and jump in, whether it is shoring up doors or reminding everybody that what you do with vegetables is to boil (or stew, or bake) them, all while keeping a pot of hot coffee on 24/7 (the liquid, after aviation gasoline and bunker oil, that won World War II).Howard Hawks (THE BIG SLEEP, TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT, RED RIVER, RIO BRAVO, HIS GIRL Friday, BRINGING UP BABY, and on and on and on) is credited as the producer of this effort, and is said to be an uncredited director as well, and his personal touch is all over the film. Not only is the romantic interest one of his favorite looks for a 1940's hottie, but his favorite trick of having his actors talk over each other is never so utilized as in this one. In this case the technique tends to point up the ensemble nature of the effort, something he also did successfully in more highly artistically regarded (albeit, probably not without some snobbery) films like RED RIVER or HATARI. Among other things, THE THING is one of those movies, like for instance, RED RIVER, FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX, or THE GREAT ESCAPE, about a group of guys (albeit with the much-appreciated addition of one "pin-up girl") who all pull together, each with his unique personality and personal contributions, to resolve the problem facing the group in the end. A final observation I would add is that the pacing of this movie is like lightning, comparing very favorably with movies 65 years more recent. There is practically no point in comparing this to the John Carpenter "remake" of decades later. The two are entirely different movies altogether, sharing nothing at all but the same plot premise. Given that means that a small group of people are isolated from all outside help to be terrorized by an other-worldly force of practically unprecedented malevolence, it is classic Carpenter material, something that occurred to me on a viewing many years ago before I even knew that John Carpenter had in fact done something with it. But beyond the basic settup, the two movies have absolutely nothing to do with each other. The 1951 THING is an essentially upbeat, action-oriented guy movie, whatever its eerier or spookier undertones, a reflection of good old-fashioned American expansive everyman self-confidence, and no pure horror movie. As such, it is one of my favorite movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well often The Thing (1982) is touted as being a remake of this movie and it seems the majority prefers Carpenter's version. Both movies are however very different adaptations of the short novel "Who Goes There?" and the 1982 film is closer to the source material. So for me plain and simple both movies are just different movies and (originals in their own right) that should not be compared to one another too much. I personally prefer The Thing from Another World over The Thing as the latter is a bit too graphical for my tastes and looks too much like the Alien movie in my opinion. THing from Another World is one of the better sci-fi movies where we have some interesting searching and mystery surrounding life from another planet. Even though the thing looks like Frankenstein's monster in its movements the fact that it is plant based makes this movie almost a prelude to the later "Invasion of the Body Snatchers". Very interesting dialogs and eventual conflict between scientists (Dr. Carrington played by Robert Cornthwaite) who want to learn even sacrificing themselves and the army (Captain Patrick Hendry played by Kenneth Toby) rather preserving themselves and wiping this plant life out before they pose a serious threat to humanity. A conflict that would get repeated in other sci-fi movies like for example "The Village of the Damned".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie lead to John Carpenter's "The Thing!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For 1951, this was a very good movie that pretty-much gave respect to a genre that was more-or-less considered "B-" movies. This is why the great director, Howard Hawks, didn't put his name on this, as to avoid ridicule.I just watched this on TCM (June 7, 2015) and I really liked it. It stars Kenneth Tobey (of "Billy Jack" fame) as Captain Patrick Hendry, who is sent to the Arctic to lead an investigation on a 'craft' buried beneath the ice.In his fist credited movie role as 'James Arness' (Matt Dillon of "Gunsmoke" fame), he plays 'the thing.'If you like old 1950s 'drive-in' 'creature-feature' movies about monsters and aliens that were once considered scary...then, this is for you.I recommend this slightly-scary movie to all parents of children who are showing signs of liking horror flicks! It's a very subtle introduction to this genre. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us very little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age." - H.P. Lovecraft"Indiscriminate hostility against anything that moves is not an evolutionary strategy that makes sense." - Peter Watts John Campbell wrote "Who Goes There?" in the late 1930s, a short story about researchers who discover an extraterrestrial buried in Antarctica. Campbell's story loosely resembled H.P. Lovecraft's "At the Mountains of Madness", again about aliens buried in Antartica. In Lovecraft's tale, the "aliens" are so incomprehensible, so inexplicably weird, that several human beings go insane upon seeing them.Campbell's tale was adapted for the screen in 1951. Directed by Christian Nyby, and retitled "The Thing From Another World", the film starred Kenneth Tobey as Captain Hendry, a United States Air Force pilot stationed at the North Pole. Because master director Howard Hawks was frequently on set, and heavily guided Nyby's direction, "World" is oft said to be "actually directed" by Hawks."World" opens with trademarked Hawksian bluster. Hawks, who reportedly used a stopwatch to coax faster speech, introduces us to a series of military men, each spewing dialogue like machine-guns, dead air between sentences mercilessly eradicated. These men are ordered to a scientific research station. Once there, they learn that an object has been tracked on radar before crashing. A team is assembled to investigate.Hawks' band of heroes is comprised of archetypes common in 1950s sci-fi. We have the square jawed hero, the female love interest (Margaret Sheridan), the wisecracking journalist, the bearded scientist and so on. Hawks' handling of these characters, though, remains fresh. Captain Hendry and his crew trade naturalistic buddy bander, and the dialogue between Hawks' scientists crackle with a pragmatism and authenticity atypical of the times. Elsewhere Margaret Sheridan encapsulates your typical Hawksian woman: strong, sassy, sexy, adept at emasculating men and shot with a fetishist's eye. When Sheridan and Hendry aren't locked in wittily combative dialogue, she's tying him to chairs and making veiled allusions to sex and bondage. Hendry and his crew arrive at the crash-site and, unsurprisingly, discover a UFO buried in the ice. In a brilliantly shot sequence, which beats the lame "UFO discoveries" of the other two films in this franchise, Hendry's men fan out and attempt to mark the circular borders of the craft. Though several men squeal like idiots ("We've finally found a UFO!"), the scene's overall tone is one of horror. One can imagine 1950s audiences, a decade rife with UFO flaps and awash with ET paranoia, at the edges of their seats. Hawks' film felt "real".Hendry and his men find an alien frozen in a block of ice and transport it back to base-camp. They assume the creature is dead. We know it's alive. Creepily, we watch as the alien thaws.The alien in "World" is just a man in a rubber suit. Despite this, it's one of cinema's best shot monsters. We first see it embedded in a block of ice, its body murky and mysterious. We next see the creature in a great long shot, its shadowy, featureless form shockingly attacked by dogs. The alien appears in just 3 more scenes, each brutally short, and each unexpectedly accelerating from banality to chaos in the space of seconds. For a 1950s movie, this is all quite remarkable. Other scenes involving dismembered hands, or featuring talk of human beings skinned and strung from ceilings or of killed dogs, are particularly gruesome and/or risqué for their era.The scientists in "World" eventually determine that the creature is a type of plant or "intellectual carrot". This aspect of the film hasn't aged well. Nevertheless, one sees moments in "World" which have influenced countless other features. The motion detector used by our heroes to track the creature will appear in Ridley Scott's "Alien" (Scott would also borrow heavily from "It! The Terror From Space"), the flare guns and fuel used to attack the beast will appear in the "Jaws" franchise and so on and so on."There are no enemies in science, only phenomena to be studied," Dr Carrington, the film's chief scientist, says. "We must not destroy a source of wisdom!" The film's dismissal of Carrington reveals the worst aspect of Hawks picture (John Campbell has himself oft been criticised by other sci-fi writers for his conservative, right-wing and at times reactionary themes). Representative of science, progress, knowledge, and virtually in love with the film's alien ("No pleasure, pain, emotions, sexuality or heart, it is our superior in every way!"), the film climaxes with Carrington running up to the alien and attempting to communicate with it. In a scene which Ridley Scott would rip-off for his own "Prometheus", the creature merely looks at Carrington before punching him in the face. In an instant, the paranoia and militarism of the film's US soldiers is validated; there are aliens out there, they are dangerous, and they want to conquer us all. The film's Cold War politics are encapsulated by its final line: "Keep watching the skies!" Ironically, despite its paranoia, Hawks' film has its heroes acting as a group, pooling their talents and all collaborating and functioning as a unit. Hawks offers no single hero and his leading men are all virtually indistinguishable. John Carpenter's 1982 remake of Campbell's tale, in contrast, embodies a different cultural zeitgeist. Here, everyone is at odds. And despite resembling a bearded hippie, our lead's a Randian hero, everyone around him an individualist with no higher purpose beyond personal survival.8.9/10 ? Masterpiece. See "Forbidden Planet".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 1950s Sci-Fi entry has held up reasonably well over the decades.The characters are enjoyable and the brisk dialog is well-written. The film captures the frantic desperation that develops when people realize they are in big trouble and the calvary isn't coming and the frigid, dark isolation of the location comes through very well. You can see yourself in their place.The science is dated of course but that's acceptable. Younger audiences will probably have a hard time imagining a time when a large portion of the population absolutely believed in flying saucers and genuinely feared invasion by Earth-bound evil-doers (i.e., the Ruskies) - and worst of all: no cell-phone service.This film has nothing for which to apologize and is a superb example of a well-done science/drama/horror of its era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A flying saucer lands near a scientific outpost in the Antarctic, and a large, scary creature emerges. Unlike the terrible 1982 remake, this one takes its time with character development and slowly builds up the suspense before eventually revealing the title creature (aka Marshal Matt Dillon!). This was the first directorial credit for Nyby, who had previously edited several films for Hawks, and it is believed that Hawks himself directed much of it. Nyby's subsequent output would support the theory that Hawks lent a helping hand. The ensemble cast is pretty good, although it features no names (other than Arness) that would be recognizable today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite a no-name cast and several scenes shot in a Los Angeles meat locker, this fx- deprived film remains a science fiction classic. Modern movie makers should take lessons from Howard Hawks in how not to lose the human element while letting your imagination take over. And though I am skeptical of the film's underlying message, at least the conflicts are plausibly posed and intelligently handled. Then too, there's the dialogue, long a Hawks trademark, that at times flows so effortlessly the rhythms approach the poetic as they underscore a free and easy banter among military professionals. Seldom has camaraderie under pressure been more persuasively portrayed, or the responsibilities of command more democratically depicted. Having seen the movie on first release, I am glad to say the highlights have lost little over the years, though I still puzzle over a super space-traveler who communicates only in grunts. And while flying saucers and nuclear-age mutants have passed into yesterday's lore, the clarity of the Lederer script and the excitement of the Hawks staging still happily endure, especially when compared with the muddled, over-fx'ed remake. All of which shows once again why more is so often less, and less is so often more. As the studio hosts at TCM like to say : this is a movie Essential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good 50's blend of science fiction and horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though they are basically similar in plot-line, it isn't terribly useful comparing The Thing From Another World with its 80's remake. While I do prefer the latter, it does benefit from things that the original movie simply could not do at the time. Namely, impressive special effects technology and the horror intensity that would not have been permissible back in the early 50's. The older movie is still good though, and is one of the better sci-fi horror films from the 50's.It is about the discovery of an alien spacecraft in the Arctic. The scientists who find it subsequently find the body of a creature from the ship. They transport it back to their base. And soon this alien comes free and begins terrorizing everybody it comes into contact with.The alien itself is a tall bald humanoid being - a fairly threatening creature all-in-all. We don't see a great deal of him but when he does appear it's well orchestrated. There is one memorable jump moment where he appears suddenly from behind a door, and best of all a dramatic and very well executed scene where he storms into a room that is ablaze with flames. The 50's was a good time for sci-fi, and this is one that does still have a fair bit of vibrancy. It throws in a few unique ideas too, such as the concept of the creature being a form of vegetation that can easily regenerate itself if harmed - fairly original ideas for the time. This is certainly worth checking out if you like 50's sci-fi or horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't read the short story; I'd be thrilled to. However, I *love* John Carpenter's version, which I understand is a proper adaptation of that, rather than a remake of this. Let's get the negatives out of the way, because if you can make it past those, this is good. It does not use the isolation to generate tension; in fact, it hardly musters up any, on account of the seemingly *huge* crew of the base being witty throughout. The creature itself is relatively scary, if primitive; the potentially interesting conflict between wanting to destroy the dangerous being and trying to study it is overruled by the reasoning of the time. Maybe stating that 50's sci-fi are analogical propaganda against Communism is getting old; that doesn't mean that it can't be true. The racism and general xenophobia is plainly obvious. Not all of the science is strong in this one, and not everything else is credible, either. The music is grand, and arguably excessive, as with other pictures from the time. Still with me? Hawks was quite talented; Scarface and The Big Sleep(the only two other I've seen by him) are proof of that. His skill shines through here, as well; the build-up(if it is sabotaged by the admittedly clever and slick dialog) is expertly done, and the brief use of shadows is effective; he manages to render the alien creepy, in spite of the minimal nature of the costume. The setting and such are pretty convincing. Character development is well-done; it is noteworthy how direct the leads' man/woman relationship is for the period. The FX are fine. There is a little violence in this. I recommend this mainly to big fans of these movies and/or Howard. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the remake, but still rather good science fiction/horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter would later remake this movie and he did what so few movie makers do back then and now. He made a remake that was actually a lot better than the original source material. Granted, he made his film in the 1980's when you could show a bit more blood and make a more effective looking monster, however this film from which that film spawned was a rather good movie in its own rights. John Carpenter must have enjoyed this film a lot himself as not only did he make a remake of it, but he also featured it prominently in another of his hits "Halloween" as one of the movies that came on during the horror movie marathon and it was the most recognizable. This film differs though from the remake in many ways. For starters, in the Carpenter version had no females in it at all. While this one has one. The alien had far different plans in both versions and was different in other ways too. It looked a lot better of course in Carpenter's version, because here it was just a sort of basic monster that kind of glowed. Still, while the later version is clearly better this one has its own charm. I loved that it was set in an arctic base, one of the reasons I enjoyed Carpenter's version as well. There is also something about the alien monster that has something sinister up its sleeve. Well I guess it was only doing what came naturally to it, but still it would spell trouble for the world. So a nice sci-fi/horror combination that while it is not the film that would come later, I bet it will be better to the 2011 remake that is coming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Put a few soldiers and scientists at or near the North Pole, bring in an unknown monster, sprinkle with a few communists and monster lovers, a little cold war fear, and you have this really cool movie. There is that tussle with good old American xenophobia facing the scientist who wants to know about other worlds; shoot first and ask questions later. Eventually, the crack in his brain grows to where he's willing to let everyone die rather than discontinue his experiments. The monster takes care of any doubt. A giant carrot played by James Arness, who walks around like the Frankenstein monster. Don't these things have any intelligence? How did they ever get here if that is the case? Did their dogs build their space ships? Anyway, we eventually take care of them and continue to "Watch the Sky." This movie has one of my favorite lines. They bring in a box with a metal container: One of them says, "That's an isotope, isn't it." Of course, an isotope is an unstable element with extra neutrons. How would someone know that by looking at a metal bottle. There are a few of these mistakes, but when you come down to it, this is a well paced, exciting, first rate science fiction film, which must have helped scare the bejeebers out of people in the fifties.</fullReview>

It is a chilling scene in which the men form a circle around the outline of the ship in the ice to reveal its disc shape. Those 50s science fiction films have never been topped.

		<fullReview>Alright, let's see about this one. This is quite excellent stuff. The Thing From Another World is on my latest viewing experience.Group of military men and scientists, along with newspaper reporter, are assigned to North Pole to investigating some strange occurrences. Now, for those who had saw remake The Thing, this set up for the film is bit different but it doesn't detract our viewing experience because it has solid directing from Howard Hawks, despite the official directing credit goes to Christian Nyby. This film is solid science fiction film that relying on the suspense to maximum our viewing pleasure, which is fantastic.I thought it was rather interested that Nyby got official credit for directing The Thing From Another World but it has lot of trademarks from Howard Hawks. For example, this film contained very independent woman, which can be seen in many of Hawks' films. Also, it contained various trademarks from Hawks like teamwork and overlapping dialogues. Solid directing from someone whose doesn't even receive a credit.The Thing From Another World is maybe one out of three films that actually scared the hell out of me and it was made in 1951. I was breathing hard throughout the film because the characters are so well developed and I grew to care for them. Also, the special effects aren't overdone here but only enhanced the storyline, which is great. What makes this film so scary, for me, personally, is that we only see The Thing very few times and there is no close up on him. It builds suspense very well and it has held up very well, despite it dated a little bit.Unlike remake The Thing, this film doesn't rely on gore, although The Thing did it very well. Also, the difference between original and remake is that original has more of confined space and it is very hard to move around because the base is very small so it is very dangerous that The Thing can attack at any moment at given any place. To me, that is very scary thought if you don't have much space to hide or move around and you're like sitting duck waiting to be shot.It's astonishing, really. I was expecting cheesy B-movie and I was wrong. What I got is very top notch science fiction film that held up very well with solid characters. We understood each character's motivations and I particularly like the main character, whose is played by Kenneth Tobey, whose is very human. He may not be bright guy but he does what he can do under such extraordinary circumstances.To me, that's some solid writing and very nice little movie to check out. I would recommend this one. Yeah, it's great stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic example of anti-communist propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A spaceship crashes somewhere in the north pole and the local airforce base goes out to investigate it. They find the craft buried beneath the ice and try to use explosives to remove it from the ice. Unfortunately they destroy the spaceship but manage to save the lifeform that was also trapped in the ice. They take it back to the base to study but it escapes and then goes on a rampage across the base trying to destroy everything.The Thing is a movie very similar to a Doctor Who story called the Seeds of Doom. The creature is a plant and they are in an isolated base in the North pole. The Doctor Who story extends beyond this though to return to England where another beast escapes and grows to a gigantic size. This movie was probably the basis for this Doctor Who episode though.The Thing is cited as being an anti-communist movie, though I don't see how. The ideas that come out of the movie seem to be about the hidden battles that are fought to save the United States from invasion. This battle is fought in the North Pole and was fought without the knowledge of the American people. At the end of the movie is a very patriotic speech about this battle and how lives were lost defending America. Thus the idea is that all of these wars are fought to defend the integrity of America. Maybe subtly it is a pro-Korea film for it is telling us that the wars that are fought are fought for America, even if they are on the other side of the world.Another idea is the threat of intellectualism. The scientist in this movie wants to study the alien creature but the army wants to kill it. In this movie the army is right and the scientist is wrong. The scientist is portrayed as being an evil man who is a threat to the integrity of America. The threat comes through the fact that he does not want to destroy the creature, but rather he wants to save it. There is a constant struggle between the army and the scientist as they both try to complete their own agendas and in the end it is the army that succeeds.Even though the scientist wants to study the creature, the creature itself is very hostile. When it first wakes up it attacks, but all we have are gunshots. After that every time the creature makes an appearance it wants to kill. The scientist tries to reason with the creature but it does not want to listen, but rather kill the scientist. As such the creature is hostile and should be destroyed.One could consider the symbiotic nature of the plant creature to represent the communist state where everybody is a part of the state and works to make the whole function. The American ideal is that the individual is supreme and nothing can get in front of the freedom of the individual, while communism has the state as supreme and everybody must work together to serve the state.In the end, the themes from this movie seem to be that everything unAmerican is hostile, and they should be destroyed and not studied. Negotiation is not an option because they refuse to listen to reason so that way should not be pursued. Instead a warlike policy should be pursued, as these wars are design to defend the integrity of the United States.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Thing From Another World" is something of a classic in the realm of science fiction films. The story is loosely based on Joseph W. Campbell's classic novella "Who Goes There?" and revolves around a living 'thing' salvaged from a flying saucer that happened to crash near an arctic outpost.Christian Nyby is credited with the direction but producer Howard Hawks is rumoured to have had a hand it in as well. Either way, the direction is ably handled but not especially noteworthy. Dimitri Tiomkin's score is a good one but, as far as I'm concerned, there's not nearly enough of it.The cast doesn't include any well-known names but that doesn't mean that it's below par. While only a couple of performances can really be considered above average the trademark Hawksian banter makes the acting stand out from other films of the era.The story is supposedly allegorical in nature, reflecting the alleged threat of communism along with threats to mankind introduced by science (such as the A-bomb). I didn't really pay much attention to those aspects and they didn't really seem fully fleshed out in retrospect. I also think that the film fell short as a thriller. I seemed to constantly have the feeling that the film was on the verge of delivering on its promise, but it never did.All in all, the film isn't necessarily a bad one but it isn't really one that I'd recommend. There's better cold war era sci-fi out there, including "The Day the Earth Stood Still", released in the same year as this film. However, I'm sure I'll give this one another try down the road, probably with more attention paid to the allegorical aspects of the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm on a little goal to see the sci-fi films from the 1950's, so The Thing from Another World was next on my list. I remember watching this with my father when I was a kid, but it bored me to death, I didn't think it was scary at all. But I didn't want to write a movie comment on it until I could see it again as an adult. So I watched it this morning and I have a new look on this film, first off, I love the subtle history in these sci-fi films, I liked how the scientist that wanted to explore the alien looks Russian, and of course this was made during the cold war era, so as usual the Russian looking guy gets it. But this movie also stands out against other horror movies, it's one of the first horror movies that takes place in an isolated area, the cold and harsh weather of the North Pole. Granted, I'm still not scared of this film, but I definitely appreciate it a lot more now that I can see what The Thing from Another World was expressing to it's 1951 audience.A group of scientists in the North Pole have discovered a round ship underneath the ice, they thaw out the pilot. Still in ice, they take him back to their lab to melt the ice, but maybe that's not such a good idea since the pilot is a man killing alien from another world! He escapes the lab and starts the killing spree, the group gets together to take him down, but the bullets are failing and this thing will not stop until he's killed them all.Now I do recommend John Carpenter's remake, I think it had better character development vs. the original. But still there is something very special about The Thing from Another World, it's the first real sci-fi film that came out of the 50's, and is still very creepy. The scene where they set the alien on fire was definitely intense and scary to watch. The Thing from Another World is a great sci-fi classic that I'm sure any film lover could enjoy, I just wish I could go back in time and see this in the drive-in, lol.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"An intellectual carrot. The mind boggles."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1940s was a rather bleak decade for science-fiction fans, and I don't think that I could name a single sci-fi classic from the period. However, at the beginning of the 1950s, something happened. With the Cold War beginning to escalate and the threat of Communist invasion worsening, the imaginations of Hollywood's writers were suddenly inspired, and a string of classics were produced throughout the decade. Among the first great science-fiction films was Robert Wise's 'The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951),' which served as a cautionary warning of the growing thread of nuclear war. Also released the same year was 'The Thing from Another World (1951),' directed by Christian Nyby and produced by Howard Hawks (who is now considered to have played an uncredited role in both writing and directing). The film is an exciting and intelligent sci-fi/horror film, teeming with Hawks' trademark witty, overlapping dialogue.The film was adapted from a 1938 novella called "Who Goes There?," written by John W. Campbell, Jr {though published under the pseudonym Don A. Stuart}. Near a remote research base in the Arctic, scientists and a team of U.S. Air Force men have unearthed what appears to be a "flying saucer" recently embedded in the ice. Though the craft itself is destroyed during attempted excavation, the team uncover an apparent traveller from the spaceship, a hideous humanoid-creature encased in solid ice. However, following its return to the research base, the alien escapes captivity and embarks on a bloodthirsty rampage. In a bizarre case of nature "turning the tables," the extraterrestrial is found to be a highly-evolved plant-like species, an impervious, super-intelligent vegetable. The script doesn't even bother to hide the parallels between the extraterrestrial's arrival and a Communist invasion (The Thing is portrayed as being completely "devoid of morality"), and boasts a healthy skepticism towards scientific advancement, which was prevalent in the years following the American nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (1945).The film's highlight is undoubtedly the dialogue, and the snappy, fast-paced banter between all the characters {made famous by Howard Hawks in such screwball classics as 'His Girl Friday (1940)'} is perfectly suited to the tense and dangerous situation in which they find themselves. Nikki (played by Margaret Sheridan) is the film's sole female character, and she somehow manages to come across as strong, free-thinking and independent, despite being relegated to the feminine duty of "coffee-woman." The Thing, played by James Arness under layers of Lee Greenway's make-up work, doesn't exactly exude such intelligence as he is purported to possess {mental comparisons with dim-witted Frankenstein's Monster are impossible to ignore}, but he has his fair share of unsettling moments, particularly the perfectly-executed assault with kerosene and fire, making great use of presumably-risky stunt-work to create suspense.The influence of 'The Thing from Another World' has stretched far across the years following its release. The ironic twist of plants invading our animal-dominated planet has been recycled with varying degrees of success in such subsequent films as 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956)' and 'The Day of the Triffids (1962).' Likewise, the notion of a single extraterrestrial entity terrorising a group of people in a confined and isolated facility was also used in 'It! The Terror from Beyond Space (1958)' and, mostly notably, in Ridley Scott's 'Alien (1979).' John Carpenter directed a remake in 1982, simply entitled 'The Thing,' which I can now look forward to watching, having watched the original version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the top films in its genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much is often made of this being a low budget sci fi movie with cheap special effects. Actually, there are almost no special effects, save the costume worn by pre-Gunsmoke James Arness as the title character.That's one of the film's strengths. The movie is well past the halfway point before we even see the monster and our first looks at him are in the dark or as he is being viewed through a closing door or running away with his back turned.So the suspense about what this thing is continues until he finally bursts through the door in the final battle. That, in my view, is called good movie making.Howard Harks reportedly directed much of this film and it crackles with Hawks style dialog, which although not quite in the "His Girl Friday" league, is sharp enough to keep you glued to the screen with your ears cocked.It is, in fact, the dialog and how the people trapped in an Arctic research station react to a flying saucer landing and potential alien invasion, that makes this film so special.The heroes are the fly-boys who had just won WWII for us and so were well equipped to take on aliens from outer space. Seriously, their low key, its all part of a day's work approach to this new threat is wonderful to watch. As is the reaction of the women in the picture, who don't run screaming at the mere mention of the monster's name, as we see in so much of science fiction. They stay and become part of the fight, without looking like stereotyped, kickass broads.Lastly, much has been made of the message here. For some, Hawks famed "Watch the skies" tagline was proof he was warning about the dangers of communism, for others, the dangers of communist witch hunts.Who know? Looking back from a perspective of 50 years plus, neither seems to matter much.See the movie. It is well worth the effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright well I have to post this, The Thing From Another World is one of my favorite films ever. Although i'll admit parts of the movie do seem a bit cheesy but that just adds flavor and style to the film. The Thing from Another World was my first sci-fi thriller i ever saw as a kid, ever since than I've been drawn to films such as it from this great and fruitful era of cinematic time. This film joins the ranks with The Day the Earth Stood Still and 2001: a space odyssey. ****My next comments might be a bit of a Spoiler so if you haven't seen the film please don't read on id hate to ruin a great experience for you****One of my favorite scenes in the film is when the "thing" is breaking down the door to the barracks and the men prepare them selves to spray down the creature with gas in an effort to destroy it. This initial part where the monster busts the door down and is just standing there in a silhouette is a priceless awe inspiring moment in which the viewer is in wonder as to what the creature looks like. Through out the film the monsters face and characteristics are never shown full y they are either in shadow or seen from a distance, i think that the way that was shoot was amazing not only does the director take away some of what might have been corny make up but he also adds a helping of mystery and suspense which keeps trying to guess when we will witness the monster.My overall opinion of the film is a 9 out of 10 i think some roles could of been acted out better and the plot put more in detail in some areas but in the whole look of things this movie is a must see and is great to watch over and over again especially on a rainy day with your buddies( just don't give away the ending)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A classic science-fiction flick remade by John Carpenter in 1982 with the excellent effects done by Rob Bottin and again remade as a prequel in 2011. The story is simple. Scientist at an Arctic research station discover a spaceship buried in ice. They find the pilot after examination and takes it back to their station. Thawed out by accident hell breaks loose.The year it was made is a period I never liked. Not for horror or science-fiction. The fifties and sixties I just couldn't care at all. Earlier flicks I found awesome like Nosferatu (1922) or Metropolis (1927) just to say a few. But this is an exception.It starts a bit slow but once they discover the thing it becomes rather good. But then it drops again in scientists talking for minutes. For me it flows from good to bad. The thing itself is only for a few minutes in it. Again, it shows for me, even as called a classic, that the fifties aren't my thing. I had to see it due being a huge The Thing fan but the original one wasn't for me. Then I rather go for Invasion Of The Body Snatchers (1956) also a classic but much better.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 0/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was in middle school, I saw this when it first came out. Prior to seeing it, I'd read "Who Goes There?" which meant my expectations were high, and the film didn't come up to them. But I was in my early teens. However, as I grew older, subsequent viewings made me revise my childhood estimate. Many have commented on the overlapping dialogue, and that adds a touch of realism to the characters.Using a Flying Saucer as the spacecraft was a logical extension of the news of the time, and the lack of wild special effects was imposed by budgetary considerations. I've got this on VHS, and a DVD is on order. I do not recommend it as a first film from the 1950s to watch, but it is certainly one of the better ones from that era.</fullReview>

The screenplay was excellent. Effects were good. Characters were developed rapidly and you knew who and what they stood for.James Arness was barely recognizable but only if you have watched him over the years. He played a great Thing!Not too much gore but you get the idea. B&amp;W toned it down anyway. This one ends on a much more positive note than the remake with Kurt Russell in 1982. (That one is a great movie too)I hope someone is restoring this movie. Recent viewing on the AMC Channel show a lot of wear, scratches, flicker and a few bad spots. Worth fixing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Produced by RKO, released in 1951, rather flawed (since when did the Arctic get dark at night?!) but tons of fun! A huge influence on John Carpenter, he remade the film in 1982 as "The Thing."Howard Hawks co-directed this (but was uncredited) sci-fi B-movie masterpiece about a team of scientists who discover a human-eating monster in the Arctic after a space ship crash lands in a block of ice. The creature is frozen solid but eventually dethaws, killing their dogs and then going after the team of men (and one woman).Sure it's cheesy and some scenes are laughably bad (the "dork" character puts an electric blanket over the creature to dethaw it!) but it's the tense scenes where we never see the creature that are great, but know it's stalking the men.Trivia note: In Carpenter's "Halloween" (1978) one of the characters watches "The Thing from Another World" on the TV - interesting!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in the 70's when I was a kid black &amp; white films were on tv were almost as common as they were back in the 50's. Many a time I remember staying up to see this film on the midnight movie during the weekend or during the Saturday Monster Matinee. The film was both suspenseful and frightening. I have always enjoyed this film and despite todays better movie making technique think this film is as enjoyable now as when I was a kid.The films running time is just around 90 minutes. The movie moves fast and this helps to hold the viewers attention. Christian Nyby directed the film and is a master of keeping the story moving and putting as much story into every scene as he can. Nyby later directed the PERRY MASON television show that ran during the 50's and 60's. That show required a director who could condense as much story as possible into a very limited time slot. The actors, while not well known, except for James Arness who played the alien Thing, but that does not detract from the films acting quality. There is a romance between two of the characters but it is a small back story. The man focus is on the alien Thing and the survival of the base personnel.Some people may not enjoy the film if they are going to hold it to the same technical standards of the 82' remake or other more modern Sci-Fi films. However, if you are someone who can just sit back and let the films suspense and story carry you away this film should prove and enjoyable view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Purists will hate me but it's nowhere near as suspenseful as John Carpenter's Eighties remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Thing From Another World' is regarded by many as one of THE great 50s science fiction films. I wonder just how many of them have actually sat down and watched it recently? I always had fond memories of this one, but watching it the other week for the first time in years I was surprised how it didn't live up to the way I remembered it. In the cold light of day it is obvious that it isn't anywhere near as good as bona fide 50s classics like 'Invasion Of The Body Snatchers', 'The Day The Earth Stood Still' and 'The Incredible Shrinking Man'. It also - and purists may throw up their hands in horror, but I don't care - doesn't convey the suspense, claustrophobia and paranoia of John Carpenter's 1980s remake 'The Thing, which to my mind is one of the very best SF/horror movies ever made. While I usually thing most remakes are inferior to the originals, 'The Thing' is a major exception. I think the main reason it succeeds more than 'The Thing From Another World' is that Carpenter was much more faithful to John W. Campbell's short story 'Who Goes There?'. Director Christian Nyby (or Howard Hawks if the rumours are true) fails to make the most out of the potentially frightening situation, and the script ignores the whole shape-shifting scenario which 'The Thing' really capitalized on. However, it's still a pretty good movie comparable to lesser movies from the period like 'Them!'. The cast are all pretty good, and for the most part it's entertaining, though for me the climax is rushed and unsatisfying. Anyone interested in the history of SF or horror movies must watch this film, but to be totally honest, it hasn't aged as well as many would like you to believe. I suggest watching it, and then 'The Thing' for the real deal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Characters in 1978 film Halloween are watching this classic film, it was of course remade by John Carpenter as The Thing in 1982, and again (apparently as a prequel) in 2011, I was most interested to see the original film, from director Christian Nyby and producer (also uncredited director) Howard Hawks (Scarface, Bringing Up Baby, To Have and Have Not, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes). Basically General Fogerty (David McMahon) dispatches a United States Air Force crew from Anchorage, Alaska to a North Pole scientific outpost to join chief scientist Dr. Arthur Carrington (Robert Cornthwaite), there they have evidence of an unknown craft crashed nearby. Captain Patrick Hendry (Kenneth Tobey) and his airmen fly to the found crash site and investigate, with reporter Ned "Scotty" Scott (Douglas Spencer) tagging along for the story, they find a large mysterious craft lying beneath refrozen ice, with a rounded airfoil protruding from the surface, outlining the shape it is confirmed as a flying saucer. They decide to deice the craft with thermite heat bombs, but this ignites the metal alloy and causes a destructive explosion, nearby however they find a tall body also buried under refrozen ice, deduced as a survivor from the crashed craft, so they excavate a large block of ice around the body and fly it back to the research facility. Some of the scientists and crew want to thaw out the mysterious creature, and Scott wants to release the story to the press, but Hendry insists waiting until they receive further instructions from the Air Force, and that there should be someone taking watch of the ice block and the body inside. Corporal Barnes (William Self) takes the second watch and covers the ice block with a blanket to avoid looking at the creature, however it is an activate electric blanket that slowly melts the ice, the thing inside revives, Barnes panics and shoots at it, but the alien escapes into the sub-zero cold and raging storm. The thing is attacked by sled dogs, airmen recover a severed arm, examining the tissue sample Dr. Carrington reveals it is vegetable rather than animal matter, the creature is a highly evolved form of plant life, it requires blood to survive and reproduce, the Air Force personnel see the creature as a danger to them all, but Dr. Carrington is convinced they could reason with it, as it has much to teach them. Three men stand guard during night to await the creature's return, Carrington meanwhile secretly stores pods created from the blood plasma of the thing in the greenhouse, later the bodies of two scientists inside are discovered, with their blood drained, the thing does return and almost kills Dr. Stern (Eduard Franz), its arm has regenerated, it escapes and again breaks into another building of the compound. Carrington's secretary Nikki Nicholson (Margaret Sheridan) reluctantly updates Hendry about missing plasma, confronting Dr. Carrington the alien seeds have grown at an alarming rate, and the crew lay a trap for the thing, and manage to set it alight with flamethrowers, flare guns and kerosene, forcing the creature to jump through the window into the arctic storm. Nikki notices the temperature inside the station is dropping, due to a heating fuel line sabotaged by the alien, so the final stand against it is taken to the generator room, they create a trap in the hope of electrocuting the visitor, Carrington makes his desperate attempt to reason with the creature, but he is knocked aside, the plan goes ahead and the thing is electrocuted, smouldering the creature to ash, the alien pods are then destroyed, Scotty finally reports his "story of a lifetime", warning reporters and all listening to "watch the skies". Also starring James Young as Lt. Eddie Dykes, Dewey Martin as Crew Chief Bob, James Arness as 'The Thing', Robert Nichols as Lt. Ken 'Mac' MacPherson, John Dierkes as Dr. Chapman and Sally Creighton as Mrs. Chapman. Obviously this being older and black and white you are not expected to see the shocking and amazing special effects of the remakes, this is much more chatty, but it is well scripted, there are signature flourishes of classic monster movies, and it is tense enough to settle into, a worthwhile science-fiction horror. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somewhere near the North Pole army pilot Captain Patrick Hendry (Kenneth Tobey) is called in to enquire into a mysterious crash landing near one of the polar bases. On the ground the crew discover the frozen debris of a flying saucer, which they inconsiderately destroy when trying to thaw the ice. However they manage to cut out a block containing the remains of a alien being, who however is not as deceased as could be expected...Essentially more a thriller than a horror, Howard Hawks delivers an overly refrained take on John Campbell Jr's short story "Who Goes There?", re-envisioned to much better result by John Carpenter in the classic "The Thing". Whereas Carpenter sticks more closely to the text source, Hawks delves more into the faulty 1950s UFO craze and mankind's attempt to counter the deadly threat. As always two sides collide - the scientist with his undying focus on uncovering cosmic mysteries and the more reasonable hero intent on saving his hide (with humankind benefiting in the process). The dichotomy is pretty solidly based in the era, that so widespread within society due to the terror of nuclear warfare.Nonetheless what makes Hawks' movie so inferior to Carpenter's version was keeping to the strengths of the novella: the unknown face of evil, as terror metamorphoses and takes on various forms bringing suspense to a whole new level. Meanwhile "The Thing from Another World" falters throughout on building tension, something best felt in between attacks of the plant-based monstrosity, where the crew casualty banter and sit around, seemingly not entirely engaged by the horror lurking outside. The monster itself fails to be truly gripping just briefly jumping out arms flailing, but doing little in terms of actions to instill dread. Despite the game of 'cat and mouse' with humans the prey, characters rarely seem to be thrown out of their comfort zone. Certain moments remain enticing with a significant dose of atmosphere created by the subzero windstorm surrogate of claustrophobia. However the overall script faults standing out in comparison to the 1982 film, make Hawks original nothing more than a curiosity.Naturally special effects and technical capability are a far cry from nowadays norms, but short era adjustment deems these minor issues. The strongest point remains the overall banter of the on-site crew, white cause a chuckle and some real connection with the Arctic maroons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridley Scott, This Film Might Sound Familiar to You</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What impressed me most about this well-regarded monster movie from 1951 is how much Ridley Scott's 1979 "Alien" ripped it off wholesale.Both films feature a team of scientists trapped by their environment with an alien life form. Both films feature an alien that use humans for a vital part of its own life cycle. Both films feature an alien that no one can figure out how to kill. Both films feature a character who wants to preserve the alien at the expense of the human crew. And even little details, like the geiger counter used in the 1951 film, that shows a little blip tracking the alien so that the scientists and audience know when it's getting closer, was borrowed for Scott's film.But "Alien" is much better. Don't get me wrong. "The Thing from Another World" is good. It's extremely well acted for this kind of movie, and it's got a realistic way of using overlapping dialogue that reminded me of the way Robert Altman films would sound twenty years later. But this film doesn't deliver on the sense of tension and dread it builds in its opening scenes. Once the monster actually makes his appearance, and we see a man in a big rubber suit, this becomes just another B monster movie from the 50s.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is fine - it's not a great film - it's not even remotely scary. But I'm sure it was - in 1951 - and it still holds up well. The actors take the movie quite seriously. That's what makes an early sci-fi like this work so well. But there are no stand-out performances.After the first 10 or minutes, it's a pretty brisk film - and you never know who will "come in from the cold" (excuse the cold-war pun) when the door slams open. I like the Tiomkin score of this film. There's really not much to it, just really 6 notes - but they are very memorable. There is really very little incidental music - and when he does have some, it's that same 6 notes.I think it's important to point out that THE THING is 180 degrees different than another picture put out the same year, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL takes a positive view of the aliens and portrays the aliens as those who want to help our world. On the other hand, THE THING portrays the aliens in a dark light; inhuman, no feelings, brutal to humans and animals - just some kind of horrible plant-being that enjoys blood.The lead scientist (Cornthwaite) can get absolutely no sympathy from anyone in the film - until the VERY end of the movie, by the civilian reporter. Seems to me, the Air Force hates the guy.The message herein is so much different than THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. Still, I didn't have any pity for the lead scientist. I was kind of glad when The Thing pops him...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was only 10 years old in 1951 when my mother scraped together enough money to take my two sisters, brother and myself to see the movie. It was absolutely frightening and on the way home (we walked in those days) I saw the "Thing" at every alley and dark spot we passed! I dreamed about "The Thing" for weeks. It didn't seem to affect my friends in the same manner as myself. They mainly laughed about it and at me. I'll tell you this, it was no laughing matter to me. I have the rare version of the film on tape with the missing 12 minutes from the original movie version. I have not seen the movie on DVD, bit if it becomes available I will definetly buy it. Great old Sci-Fi movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know what I like about 50's science fiction films? The main characters are always portrayed as one big cozy family. There's this feeling of insularity being intruded on by outside forces, which in a sense was what the 50's were all about. Communism threatening the American way of life and all that.Here there's this wonderful set-up of the Air Force captain (Kenneth Tobey) and his two crewmen playing cards at an Alaskan air base when the jovial newspaper reporter comes in and joins their group. Soon they're off to the North Pole to investigate a mysterious "plane crash." There they meet up with old friends, including the captain's love interest (Margaret Sheridan). Before anything has really happened, you're introduced to this happy group of people, one with enough different characters that you're bound to be drawn into their little circle. When the monster appears shortly, you're part of the action. It's him against us."War of the Worlds" had the same catch. It starts off with the scientist on a fishing trip with his friends. He joins a group of people at a square dance in the nearby town, meeting up with an attractive young girl and her father. Again, the family unit thing is played out before the action really begins.I guess I like films like "The Thing" because they remind me of the warmth and innocence of those times. It was before the cynicism of the 60's when darker forces within ourselves began to take over. In these films, evil was always well-defined and came at us from the outside. We were goodness and innocence that pulled together in tough times to overcome evil.Anyways, "The Thing" is one of the best sci-fi films ever made. The story is terrific - UFO crashes in Arctic, military men and scientists recover a survivor who turns on them in a murderous rampage - and the direction (Howard Hawks mostly) is tight. Plus there's enough realism for it to still be entertaining to our jaded 21st century minds so it's held up well over the decades. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Personal Favorite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thing (1951) is one of best SciFi movie ever produced and one of my personal favorites.It didn't have digital effects to wow the audience so it had to rely on a tight script and good acting. The interplay and overlap of dialogue is wonderful to hear. I've watched this movie many times and never tire of hearing it's crisp conversational style.The use of black and white as well as Dimitri Tiomkin's score add to the atmosphere. Although most of the characters are stereo-types, they play well in the story. Everyone in the cast gives a good performance. Of special note are Kenneth Tobey (one of my favorite 50's SciFi stars) is great as Capt. Hendry and Dewey Martin stands out as Hendry's Crew Chief and "idea man". Douglas Spencer has a ball with his part as Ned Scott, newspaper man, who can't get Hendry to let him release his story and has the funniest (intentional) lines in the film. Margaret Sheridan plays a very sexy Nikki although the references to her one night stand with Hendry is mentioned only in true 50's style.I won't compare this movie to the newer John Carpenter version because it's like comparing apples and oranges. They are both good films from different eras.The original Thing from Another World is a classic and is still a very entertaining film today. When will they release it on DVD ?? !! If you do, please put the missing 6 minutes back in.Remember to "Watch the Skies - Keep Looking"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mass Culture Theory in action or a cinematic classic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching The Thing From Another World I cannot help but be torn between two interpretations. On the one hand, it exhibits all the attributes of a generic product of the 1950s culture industry, the inbuilt reaction, the familiar plotlines, and yes even a few cracks at the Soviets thrown in for good measure. On the other hand, it also represents one of the finest examples of the invasion narrative I've seen, and in terms of entertainment value it still hold up even today, despite the shoddy special effects (although these were fairly spectacular at the time).The dialogue is a joy to listen to, moving at a pace seldom seen in modern films, overlapping, interrupting, bombarding the audience with information. The performances of Carrington and the Army Captain are excellent, and the supporting cast give ample aid to them, especially the fabulous Mr Scott.Overall then I would say that I definitely enjoyed this film very much, and divorce it from the climate of the early 1950s, the Soviet threat, the nuclear threat, the threat of communist infestation, and it's symbolism is less apparent to the casual observer. Nevertheless it's rigid plot which leaves little or no room for audience interpretation, and it's sledgehammer use of music and editing to engineer a response counts against it. A high quality example of 1950s cinema therefore, but difficult to view entirely objectively, and beset by significant flaws.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of us have a movie or TV show that triggered nightmares when we were a child. This was mine. I saw it in a darkened theater when I was six years old, and it had just been released. You know the rest of that story.Upon more recent and mature viewing, I was impressed with the relative quality of the production, the tightness of the script, and the comparative restraint of the melodrama, compared to its s-f peers.It builds real suspense without resorting to the overdramatization so common in similar stories. I am not going into the details of the movie, but it is the best of the flying saucer survivor movies of its era. The isolated antarctic setting contributes to the sense of desperation and suspense that builds as the movie proceeds.I haven't seen the eighties remake with Kurt Russell, but I doubt that it compares very well to this original.</fullReview>

He's got legs and a head. I can see 'em."In what I like to call a, "DON'T OPEN THAT DOOR, STUPID!", thriller. The movie sets you up for a roller coaster ride of hide and seek. Set in the confines of the outpost and against the low light darkened corridors, this film is sure to make you jump at least once before the climactic confrontation and electrocution scene.Still one of the best Sci-Fi suspense thrillers of it's time.A couple of interesting facts told to me by Robert Nichols, who plays Lt. Ken McPherson, is that some of the end sequence, when the Thing turned off the heat, was actually shot in a meat packing plant so that the actors breath could be seen. Howard Hawks was also famous for taking an actor aside before shooting a scene and giving him or her and extra line or two to throw in without telling the other players to make the scene sound and look more natural.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So, This Is Where It All Began...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you didn't know before, now you know whom to thank for the nearly endless cycle of "small group endangered by the creature" movies. "Alien" in 1979 set off the deluge, but the original "Thing" is the granddaddy of them all.What struck me about "The Thing" was it's sense of balance. Hawks and company know when to show us pieces of business with the cast (the banter between the Air Force captain and his crew, the debates amongst the scientists, the obligatory love story), but they also know when to pile on the suspense. They wisely keep The Thing in the shadows most of the time (the makeup looks like a bland Frankenstein Monster), which really adds to the mystery. It's part of the old-fashioned school of suspense, where the director didn't feel the need to splash around the gore or provide scantily-clad girls for the creature to attack (not that I mind the latter too much...)And with that balance comes a sense of respect. Hawks and company respect the audience's intelligence, the intelligence of their characters, and the menace of The Thing. If one of these factors is downplayed too much (symptomatic of most Hollywood horror these days, I'm afraid), the whole movie goes out of whack. But instead, "The Thing" is a tight, effective classic.How does it stack against its remake? I think the two versions of "The Thing" are different enough that you can really judge them as two different films: in this light, Carpenter's film is more of a reconceptualization of Campbell's original short story than an out-and-out remake. I personally give a slight edge to the 1982 version, both for its stunning visual effects and because the overlapping dialogue of the 1951 version really started to get on my nerves after a while (having seen "Red River," I know this is a Hawks trademark, but still...)</fullReview>

But like all decent movies there's still stuff here enjoy, like the Frankenstein likened monster (even if the grotesque shapeless monster in the remake is far better), the still impressive fire based action set pieces, and the good production values that make this feel at least a little like it was actually shot in the Arctic.

When they arrive at the crash scene they realise that whatever is buried underneath the ice was so hot that it burnt through the snow and ice to get buried under it all. The curious officers use thermite bombs to melt the snow and ice around the UFO they realise that there is a something underneath in the shape of a human so they take it back to base. Back at the base the person in charge Hendry insists that the ice around "the thing" must not be melted but one of the curious officers cannot resist and covers "the thing" with an ELECTRIC blanket so the ice melts and "the thing" escapes and reaps havoc upon the officers.***/***** not a bad film if you enjoy old films of films</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice campy 1950s fun...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this film several times and decided to watch it again, as it's been maybe 20 years since I last saw this 1950s classic. I am glad I did, as the film wasn't quite as I'd remembered.This Howard Hawks production is a horror movie in the 1950s mold. Some 50s films are about genetic freaks caused by radiation and some are about aliens--this one is about the latter. I space ship crashes in the Arctic--not too far from a military and research base. The investigating team is shocked, as they thought it was simply a meteorite--instead it's clearly a UFO. When they try to extricate it from the ice, the ship explodes--but its passenger is entombed in ice and is brought back to the station. A gung-ho and rather crazed scientist works on melting the ice--and soon the thing comes to life....and it's NOT very nice. In fact, it has a taste for blood and seem impervious to their weapons.Underneath all the makeup is James Arness as the creature. He reportedly was embarrassed by this role but the fact is this was his big career break. So, even though all he needed to do was run about behaving menacingly, it brought his name to the public and the rest is history.So is it worth seeing? Heck yeah,...unless you are stupid. It's taut, exciting and I loved the Doctor--he was amoral and quite the nut-job--and made a very nice new sort of character--far different and more interesting than the nice-guy Scientist played by Edmund Gwenn in "Them!". Overall, great campy fun--and not the gross-out movie like the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thing from Another World (1951) **</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I took another shot at this so-called "classic" that must have come off stronger in its heyday. While so-so and certainly not a bad film, today it feels like one of any number of sci-fi '50s flicks that came along after it. THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD remains one of the most incredibly overrated movies in history for me. Although the on screen directorial credit is given to Christian Nyby, it's been long believed that Howard Hawks (who produced) had a hand in it. I firmly believe that it's because of Hawks' involvement that this thing enjoys such bizarre praise, despite that it's so undeserving. Maybe some of its acclaim also has to do with figuring in that this was the first real "flying saucer/space monster" sci-fi film to come out of the 1950s.There's very little going on when we're not presented with a lot of talking heads and overly-analytical dialogue. The movie thinks it's intelligent, but it's hard to keep a straight face while watching learned scientists and soldiers seriously discuss a vegetable creature that's like a living and thinking carrot but resembles Yul Brynner, yet don't wonder how it managed to wear shirts, pants and shoes. This monster can behave brutally at times (its attack on the dogs is one merciful high point), but he's also pretty pedestrian looking for a living carrot man. None of the characters are particularly interesting or likable, from Ken Tobey's perfunctory captain, to the wise-cracking commentator, and the over-protective doctor. There's also a girlfriend thrown in for good measure, but she leaves no impression despite a lightweight "bondage" scene that was restored for the DVD but serves no purpose and was better off missing to keep the movie shorter. If there was ever a remake that surpassed its original while remaining closer to its source, it was John Carpenter's 1982 version, which was a truer adaptation of John Campbells' 1938 novella entitled "Who Goes There?" and was superior to this film in every way. ** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun 50s Scary film, but not as good as the remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although inferior- and significantly different- to the 1982 remake, this old school version is worth checking out. Set in the North Pole, a military squad set to uncover a crash-landing. Accompanied by scientists, and a journalist looking for his big break, the squad find a flying saucer beneath the ice. After accidentally destroying the vessel, they find a humanoid trapped in the ice, and they take its frozen body back to their base.As you can guess, the "Thing" eventually breaks free, and creates havoc within the base. Unable to communicate out, the friction between the military and the scientists become clear as the latter group want to keep the creature alive. Dr Carrington (Robert Cornthwaite), the lead scientist believes that the being is of superior intellect, but the others don't want to be the creature's food. So, a struggle internally occurs as well as externally trying to keep "the Thing" at bay! This works fairly well within the film.There is an interesting concept regarding the "thing"- which is vastly different from the remake. In the original, the thing doesn't mimic various shapes and characters- instead, it is just one humanoid creature. But it's a humanoid creature made up of vegetarian and plant-life. The theory is, that plants evolved on it's planet to form this creature which feeds off blood. I thought the concept was pretty good for a 50s B-grade horror flick, even if the scientists came to their conclusions and figured out the creature far too quickly. It was a fun movie, and easily watchable, just don't expect it to be as good as the excellent remake.This one gets a ***? out of *****!</fullReview>

My reaction was immediate and devastating....I sent seven extra large drinks flying all over this poor guy as he scared the living daylights out of me! Thought my heart was going to leave my chest. For its time and the level of special effects available, this movie was top notch. Plot was simple, nothing to concentrate on, one plot, etc. Sure, effects have made light year jumps since then, but this was good,old fashioned suspense and the in-your-face of "what-could-be-out-there" horror at its best.

		<fullReview>There's no doubt that Howard Hawks' version of The Thing was a pioneering monster flick, that truly got the ball rolling for all the classic monster flicks to follow, like Alien. However, I must say that I found John Carpenter's vastly underrated 1982 remake to be far superior to Hawks' version. Since the creature in this film is not a shapeshifter (like in Carpenter's film and the original novella) it lacks that terrifying lack of trust in an isolated enviornment that made the other two so terrifying. Also, the special effects leave much to be desired, for the monster is nothing more than James Arness with a bald cap and some creepy claws; hardly the show-stopping effects pioneered in Carpenter's film. However, the movie makes up for its weak effects by keeping the monster hidden most of the time, and making his few appearances as suprisingly frightening as possible. Overall, The Thing from Another World was a truly classic film, but it's glory days are over, for it has been bested.</fullReview>

These people would probably die of fright today with all the make-up artistry and the electronic special effects modern filmmaking is using. Director Nyby (some experts say Howard Hawkes was looking over his shoulder) had to remove these shots from the released movie. "The Thing" was the first picture where theremin (electronic device playing high frequency vibrations) was used. Theremin was the Russian-born inventor of this "musical instrument". It was an excellent movie for the 1950's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>....time has taken the edge of this once novel horror science-fiction. The plot of a group of people cloistered into one setting and menaced by a fiend has been re-used countless times through the 1950s decade up to the present. Monster seen at the end ultimately disappoints: a tall actor (James Arness), with weird nails, no hair and wearing a jumpsuit, almost like the Frankenstein creation, fails to represent something from outer space too convincingly. Beast makeup got more flamboyant a few years later, such as "Creature From the Black Lagoon" (1954). The tense Geiger counter device was borrowed for "Aliens" (1986). Actress Margaret Sheridan is top-billed but has very little to do, mostly as a flirtatious love interest to the hero (Kenneth Tobey). To Sheridan's credit, she is level-headed and not a screaming hysteric. The director (Christian Nyby or Howard Hawks), uses no closeups for the actors, limiting any intimate appeal to them. Ensemble cast works well, except as another reviewer stated, there's too much wisecracking, especially even after the discovery of the Thing's violent 2 murders (unseen but described in detail). The journalist (Douglas Spencer) is particularly annoying, though he delivers the film's final famous line. It must have been something to see in 1951, with its alien talk, electric gadgetry, Arctic setting, saucers, theremin music (underused actually) etc. Golden classics for the era really laid ahead, including "Day the Earth Stood Still" -1951. But it's still better than the 1982 remake, which is almost intolerable with its graphic, grotesque special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Prologue for "The Thing"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't like to write comments with spoilers, but this movie requires some "inner views".I had great expectations about this movie, unfortunately, almost none was fulfilled. Unlike classic movies like "The Day The Earth Stood Still" and "Forbidden Planet", this movie lacks a good script and character development.When something extraordinary happened, the characters continued doing what they were doing before, as if nothing had happened at all. The degree of "uncaring" of the characters were not the same, of course. The extreme example was the professor, when someone died, he continued doing his researches (and would kill everyone else just to keep doing that). And if you think that "some people are just like that," you are right, I have seen myself, people that don't give a second glance to whatever is, as long as it has nothing to do with what they are doing. The problem is, such kind of people has a psychological pattern, which the actors in this movie failed completely to play. These characters would deal with global extinction with the same face of "thanks for the coffee". Actually, they reacted more to the coffee than to the (very few) attacks of the creature.To their defense, I must say that the script didn't help, it was full of unrealistic and misleading lines. The scientists kept changing 'side', some times they were blind researchers, other times they were (mildly) worried about the potential dangers of the creature to the world. The military were worse, they surrounded a Geiger counter and watched the readings going mad not even blinking. Actually, they didn't even worry about the fact that there was radiation!Not for a single moment this movie managed to create a suspenseful scenario, because the characters never faced any real danger, the very few times they were attacked by the alien were situations they created to themselves or, at most, could have been avoided simply by locking the doors. In other words, the creature was not "scary", it was pathetic, as was many lines said along the movie, like the very last ones said by the journalist on the radio, till then, one of the few characters that seemed to have a brain.The only wonderful thing in the movie is the beginning. The first twenty minutes promised an epic science fiction movie, with beautiful aerial shots of the crashing site, which is amazingly convincing, by the way, and a really thrilling approach of the American team. Then, in the next five minutes, things start getting weird and the characters start doing dummy things. If you liked John Carpenter's "The Thing", you MUST watch this movie just because of the first twenty-five minutes. Every little thing that is told and showed about the Norwegian team in "The Thing" is actually played by the characters in this movie, including things that you could have thought that made no sense at that time. If you ignore the rest of this movie, the beginning is a perfect prologue to "The Thing". I'm absolutely sure it's not a coincidence, John Carpenter must have watched this and thought, if not spoken out loud, "oh my, I can't believe they did that," then took the cue to make a movie that would be like a sequel to those first twenty-five minutes. And for them, I give this movie a 3/10, it's about the fraction this movie managed to entertain me, 25min out of 80min. If John Carpenter hadn't made "The Thing" upon this, I would have given this a 1/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Military workers and scientists near Anchorage discover the wreck of a flying saucer and thaw out its passenger, an alien monster who quickly wreaks havoc. From a short story by John W. Campbell Jr., who originally had the Thing taking on the personalities of its victims; this film-version, directed by Christian Nyby (with the uncredited assistance of producer Howard Hawks) has been reworked but not revitalized--it ultimately seems diluted, what with a talky exposition and slim plotting in the second-half. The memorable black-and-white cinematography is terrific however, and the players thankfully do not lapse into camp histrionics. The 1982 remake, while filled with gory effects, retained the original vision of Campbell's material. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most errors ever in one movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie, as a kid, I found it kind of scary. Watching it last night on TCM, however, I was underwhelmed. The sets are primitive, the acting is hammy, and James Arness as The Thing was just pathetic. He looked like Frankenstein's Monster in a wet suit. Worse, however, was the total disregard for scientific and technical accuracy. In fact, by the end of the movie I concluded that "The Thing" contains more errors of this nature than any other movie made ? ever!*** SPOILERS !!! ***To start with the obvious, the movie is set at or very near the North Pole, in November ? when it's dark outside 24 hours a day. Even at 80 degrees North latitude, there are less than two hours of daylight on November 3. Yet the crew that sets out to find the crashed spacecraft seems to have quite a lot of daylight to work in.There are no airlocks on the doors to the polar station; people just waltz in and out. The sled dogs are left out at night (which would be always) even though someone mentions a temperature of 60 below. The crashed spacecraft is described as weighing 20,000 tons, and affecting compasses for hundreds of miles around. That sounds like a lot of metal, but battleships weigh a lot more than that and compasses work just fine even when one is nearby. Based on sizes and weights of other aircraft, a 20,000 ton disk-shaped spaceship would be about 300 feet across ? larger if it were made of something like titanium. Yet when the search party fans out and stands around the ship's perimeter it is only about a 100-ft circle. A ship that size would weigh a few hundred tons at most. Why didn't they just describe the crashed object as "highly magnetic" and have the file get irrevocably stuck to the tail fin when one guy tries to file off shavings? Attempting to thaw out the ice surrounding the ship with a couple of thermite charges simply wouldn't work. Those charges could melt a few cubic yards of ice, at most. And what were they hoping to accomplish, anyhow? Assuming they could melt the ice, what are they gonna do? Dive into ice-cold water, in the Arctic winter, to look at the ship close-up? almost certainly, they would have radioed back to civilization and the higher-ups would have told them not to disturb anything. Then, come Spring, there would be a major scientific expedition equipped with excavating equipment and sophisticated instruments.There wasn't even any good plot-related reason to try to excavate the ship from the ice. They could have discovered The Thing nearby anyway, and used the thermite to get HIM out of the ice. The amount they had might be enough. Instead, they remove a block of ice that had to weigh at least 3000 pounds, using hand tools and perhaps chainsaws. This would take at least a day, yet apparently it takes them almost no time.When the crew gets the block of ice back to the station, they bring it inside. Why? Wouldn't it make more sense to leave it outside? Who's gonna steal it?Once it's inside they put it in a storeroom, where some bozo inadvertently places an electric blanket on top of the ice. This would have almost no effect on a 3000 pound block of ice in a cold room; it would take months to melt the block this way.Once The Thing is on the loose, they try to stop it by sloshing kerosene on it and setting it afire ? inside their only shelter. Yeah, that's a really good plan. When The Thing disrupts the fuel supply to the heaters that keep the station warm, they come up with another great plan: electrocute him. OK, what does the generator run on: pixie dust? Wouldn't it be hooked in to the same fuel source as the heaters? If not, why couldn't they use some of the generator fuel to heat the place for a few hours?The setup they devise to electrocute The Thing is ludicrous. For something like that to work, he'd have to be in direct contact with the wires carrying the electrical current ? yet they put the floor grid under a wood walkway (wood is a fairly good insulator) and run some wires along the walls and ceiling. One of the characters says something about stepping up the voltage (using what?) to allow the electricity to arc across to The Thing. "That'll provide plenty of amps," he says. Wrong. When you step up the voltage, amperage drops correspondingly. To form arcs that long would take about half a million volts. If the polar station was equipped with a 100 KW generator, that would give you about 0.2 amperes ? barely enough to tickle. (Remember those Van de Graf generators at high school science fairs? Big sparks, but totally harmless!) To provide high amperage, you'd reduce the voltage ? but then you'd have to get the monster to actually touch the wires, and there'd be no cool sparks to look at.Oh, and one final question; If The Thing had come to Earth to plant his seeds and grow an army of Things, why would he be cruising around the North Pole? Wouldn't he be likely to head for a tropical jungle region, where the climate is more conducive to plant growth and there is a plentiful supply of food?Geez.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you had a conversation with a carrot lately? Do you have debates with turnips, or group conversations with heads of lettuce? Hey, plants and vegetables can think and communicate! Did you know that? According to this "intelligent" film, it's true, and look at all the people who believe what they see here on "The Thing From Another World." Who knew about Killer Tomatoes back in 1951? Thanks to this film, though, we were all "educated." I gave this a second chance, having been totally bored the first time when I saw it about 15-20 years ago on VHS. A bunch of good reviews fooled me. I should have known better, although I did find this more interesting the second time around with a decent DVD transfer.The Nobel Prize winning science "expert" who examines a torn-off limb of alien in this film, says it's the same as carrot. This genius secularist then gives us one of the dumbest premises I have ever seen on film about vegetables being human-like. Whoever wrote this screenplay made Ed Wood look like Einstein.This goofy (and very obnoxious and annoying) scientist is "unquestionably the greatest scientific mind of our day," etc., of course also mentions about man evolving from primitive creatures like fish. These anti-Creation people have been relentless in film history, especially in the '50s with all the "flying saucer" movies. To this day, they just never stop with their secular propaganda. Critics, almost all of whom are of the same mindset, eat it up! To the credit of the film, however, "Dr. Carrington (Robert Cornthwaite) does look like a total dork by the end of the story. Cornthwaite does an excellent job of being the naive and irritating voice of Liberalism in everything he says. He reminded me of the New Age saps in "Mars Attacks!" who also got a dose of reality. Same thing.The military captain in this movie is insulted and talked down to by almost everyone, including an arrogant reporter who would never get away with what he says here in real life. The man who is in charge. "Capt. Hendry (Kenneth Tobey) gets no respect.This movie isn't all bad. Infairness, the last 20 minutes here is good and when they set the monster on fire, that's a very well-directed scene. TV star James Arness, of TV's "Gunsmoke" fame, played the monster in here but you wouldn't know since they never showed a closeup of his face.The really, really funny thing about the film is the number of gullible fools who took this movie seriously!!! Talk about vegetables!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I prefer Carpenter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now - I have seen some bad sci-fi movies in my time (eg, Plan 9, Robot Monster, The Beast Of Yucca Flats, The Creeping Terror, numerous others through MST3k). The one real reason why I wanted to see it is if people were telling the truth in saying Carpenters version is better - in my opinion it is by a whole three stars making me consider it the best adaptation of the novel (not that I've read it).When you first sit down to watch this is that you will find that there are different ways of communicating terror to audiences in 1951 than they did in 1982. In this you will find that it shows. Back in the 1980's a movie like this might have had another adaptation in demand. I did like what both movies did - but in this some of the director's ways to communicate fear is somewhat dated, which is why I prefer Carpenters, it is more psychological that this and very atmospheric.The plot is that people in the North Pole find an alien spacecraft and blow the ice above it apart - the blast destroys the ship but not an occupant, the occupant is some sort of vampire with the anatomy characteristics of a vegetable (might sound corny but if you watch the movies above it would be hard to stretch anything further as far as corny goes) bullets have no damage to it and neither does fire nor ice.This is actually the most positive you will hear me say about a 50's Sci-Fi movie because most of the above ones are usually titled "Worst Film Of All Time" however in this one it is more intelligent than the others above because it offers a rather original and ingenious explanation to a monster that works, strangely. I would recommend if you want to see how horror has evolved for over 60 years and people who want to say "I can compare this to Carpenters and I prefer..."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thing from Another World-"Keep watching the skies."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released the same year as Robert Wise's The Day the Earth Stood Still-a picture in which the space alien preaches peace-The Thing from Another World was the start of the kind of movie in which the alien is definitely hostile and wanting to kill. In fact, the scientist character-Dr. Carrington (Robert Cornthwaite), despite evidence to the contrary, thinks the being is something we can learn from. Before I go on, I'd like to acknowledge two familiar voices playing characters here: "You Bet Your Life" announcer George Fenneman as Dr. Redding and Chicago native (as am I) and cartoon voice artist Paul Frees as Dr. Vorhees. They sounded so familiar that I looked up IMDb right afterwards to confirm they were who I thought they were. Anyway, this was quite talky with overlapping dialogue but what else would you expect with a film produced and directed by Howard Hawks? Yes, I said directed by Howard Hawks despite the credit going to one Christian Nyby who mainly helmed television shows after this and nothing else as distinguishing as this movie. Anyway, the banter between various men and one woman is also a Hawks trademark and seeing Kenneth Tobey as Captain Patrick Hendry trading wisecracks with Margaret Sheridan as Nikki is one of the most entertaining parts watching this. What few horror scenes there are are very effective especially when they take place in the dark and Dimitri Tiomkin's score puts such a haunting quality to it. And last but not least, Douglas Spencer as the reporter Ned Scott a.k.a. Scotty also gets some witty lines as well as the famous last one that I cited in my heading. All in all, this was quite an entertaining sci-fi/horror movie. Now I'm going to watch the John Carpenter version...</fullReview>

The scientist disobeys, lies, helps the monster breed, thinks he can persuade it not to kill them. The journalist fails to make a single good picture and eventually faints upon seeing the monster. The military chief on the other hand knows exactly what he's doing. This is the kind of picture painted by lots of movies, but that doesn't mean it's cool. In a strange twist of argument, the scientist mentions atomic technology when he defends science as the great hope of humankind. The soldiers laugh about this because of the atom bomb. As if only the scientists and not the military and politicians are to blame. Who decided to mass produce the atom bomb? Who decided to drop it on innocent people?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A military team is sent to investigate when a scientific base in the Arctic reports strange disturbances in local magnetic fields. They find a flying saucer buried in the permafrost and an alien encased in a block of ice, which they take back to base. Before they can radio for guidance however, the alien thaws out, wakes up and starts to wreak havoc ?One of the most exciting and influential science-fiction films ever made, this was the model for a slew of subsequent fifties space invader flicks and is a breathless, spine-tingling, pared-down action adventure with a wonderful military versus scientists central theme. Although well directed by Nyby, the influence of producer Howard Hawks is very strong and many of his favourite themes are here, both plot-wise (the importance of group action, loyalty and courage) and stylistically (the breakneck dialogue, Sheridan's sassy-talking dame). What distinguishes it from the populist children's sci-fi which preceded it is its maturity; these people are grownups, and the story is presented as no-nonsense matter-of-fact. Charles Lederer's script (based on a short-story by John W. Campbell) puts a lot of effort into portraying the setup and the extreme situation realistically, which works wonderfully well - by the time the monster finally appears for the last half-hour you are well and truly immersed in the situation. The fine cast (none of whom are billed at the start) keep their heads down and race through the dialogue - there's more talking in this short movie than any three of Sergio Leone's very long ones - never allowing the film to bog down or slip into comedy. There are some terrific scares, such as the classic moment when Tobey opens the door to the greenhouse and The Thing is right there, but the terror is mostly inspired by Dimitri Tiomkin's deliciously unsettling score, one of his very best. Despite all there is to savour however, this film does have a couple of flaws for me; Sheridan is billed first but her character is mostly redundant, and Hawks' perfectly-attuned team of soldiers who brush aside the silly scientists are cool but not really a very accurate depiction of military intelligence in my opinion. It's no coincidence that this was made at the height of anti-communist feeling and Stalin-inspired global mistrust, epitomised by Spencer's memorable "Keep watching the skies !" monologue finale. Don't miss this science-fiction classic, but if possible, see it on a double-bill with another great trend-setting film of 1951, The Day The Earth Stood Still, which has a completely opposite take on the military. Brilliantly remade in 1982 by John Carpenter as an even better film which retains the basic structure but is more faithful to Campbell's original story and presents a wildly different take on humanity's reaction to alien invasion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Biskind's excellent discussion of this film in his book Seeing Is Believing is worth reading. The film is a cold war allegory. A conservative film, it is quite anti-intellectual (the bad scientist/traitor), and it shows us how conservatism shaped perceptions in the fifties so that gays, deviants, and intellectuals were all parcelled together with communists. The background gender story is suggestive of how conservative foreign policy thinking during this era dove-tails with family/gender culture. Notice that when the thing, which is polysexual, is killed finally, the event coincides with the formation of a traditional heterosexual family between Nikki and the captain. Given the Bush administration's attempt to squash the press and keep information secret, it's also important to note that the press remains loyal to the military to the end. The constitution in conservative eyes takes second place to a paranoid vision of foreign threats that make authoritarianism necessary.</fullReview>

A love affair with the air force captain and a secretary. There is actually more footage of the captain making himself up for the lady than of the alien.2. A dialogue, which doesn't stop or pause, each actor sounds as though he has just memorised the lines and has to get them out quickly before he forgets. Every sentence is countered by a wisecrack from another actor ? perhaps they made it up as they went along.3. To avoid the cost of special effects we never see the alien ship ? just a tail fin, the shots of the aircraft's flights look like stock footage bought from the forces.4. Places where there should be tension and anticipated horror are filled with smart-arse wisecracks.I enjoy B movies, the ham acting and lousy sets because they were often made with enthusiasm even if it didn't come off. This one however is B movie at it's worst, turgid dross. The best scene is the title as `Thing' burns into the screen, the 1982 remake used exactly the same title sequence.

We have the regular cheery heroes and the love interest. In other words pretty much what one should expect from b-movie suspense pictures from this era(and from ours as well).Another thing that really bothers me is the Alien's "higher intellect". If it's so smart that it's capable of strategic planning, how come it acts like Frankenstein? It's clear that the writers lacked the sense of realism.Just another simple, semi-entertaining, semi-good suspense film from Hollywood. Bay and Emmerich would be proud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thing from Another World starts in a naval base in Anchorage, Alaska. Captain Patrick Hendry (Kenneth Tobey) is told by his superior General Fogarty (David McMahon, uncredited) to fly out to a research station at the North Pole where a Dr. Carrington (Robert Cornthwaite) has reported a possible crashed aircraft nearby. Hendry, his crew &amp; a reporter named Scotty (Douglas Spencer) leave for the station. Once there they head out to the supposed crash site &amp; see what looks like a tail fin poking up through the ice &amp; whatever it belongs to frozen solid beneath. Dr. Carrington &amp; his scientist mates come to the startling conclusion that buried beneath the ice is a spaceship from another world. Someone has the bright idea to use a thermite bomb which will thaw the ice but only succeeds in blowing the spaceship up. However someone notices that a human shaped figured is buried in the ice not far from the crash site, this time they use pick axes to cut a huge block of ice out of the ground containing the mysterious figure. Once back at the research station an idiot named Corporal Barnes (William Self) decides to put an electric blanket over the block of ice which has the unwanted effect of thawing out the thing from another world, no one in the station is safe as the thing needs blood to reproduce more of it's kind...Although Christian Nyby is credited with directing The Thing from Another World it's rumoured that Howard Hawkes took over during production, who knows for sure? Anyway, I personally think The Thing from Another World is a vastly overrated film, in no way do I think it's a bad film as I actually think it's pretty good but I just can't see what so many enthuse about &amp; why they proclaim it as one of the best films ever. The script by Charles Lederer based on the story 'Who Goes There?' by John W. Campbell Jr. ditches any shape-shifting elements which means there's no sense of paranoia or who we can &amp; can't trust which is one of the reasons I think John Carpenter's The Thing (1982) is a much, much better &amp; scarier film &amp; I should probably say now that Carpenter's film is one of my all time favourite horror films that genuinely scared me when I first saw it unlike any other film I have ever seen. It's a little on the slow side &amp; the thing itself only has three or four sequences throughout the entire film, having said that these scenes are without question some of the best Sci-Fi/horror the 50's gave us period. But at the end of the day The Thing from Another World is at heart a standard alien against human Sci-Fi film which the 50's are littered with. The conflict between the army who just want to kill the thing &amp; the scientist's who want to try &amp; communicate with it is far too straightforward. I also though the film was overpopulated, there are lot's of wasted character's who don't do anything or are even given a name which made it difficult to really emote with anyone as not many are developed beyond just 'being there'. The thing itself is an intergalactic vegetable apparently, well it looks a lot like Frankenstein in a boiler suit to my eye's &amp; rather wisely the filmmakers never let us get a good look at it. The acting is wooden &amp; unconvincing, I felt everyone were reading their lines off cue-cards. One positive aspect about The Thing from Another World is that it's quite creepy &amp; has a good atmosphere throughout especially for a film from the 50's. On a technical level The Thing from Another World is well made with nice clear crisp black &amp; white cinematography, OK special effects &amp; while the interiors of the research station are obviously studio set this gives them a somewhat cosy &amp; claustrophobic feeling about them. Overall I think John Carpenter's remake is vastly superior in every way to this cheap &amp; cheerful 50's attempt, it has much more atmosphere &amp; is far scarier, the way the story unfolds is more realistic, the character's &amp; acting are so much more believable &amp; I'm a Kurt Russell fan &amp; think he's fantastic in it, the special effects &amp; gore are great &amp; the shape-shifting element is used brilliantly by Carpenter to crank up the tension &amp; paranoia making ourselves question who we can &amp; can't trust unlike this one which probably couldn't include that aspect of the original story for various reasons which I felt was the main difference between the two &amp; why Carpenter's is easily the better film.Overall The Thing from Another World certainly isn't a bad film by any stretch of the imagination but at the same time I don't think it quite deserves the 'classic' reputation &amp; all the plaudit's that it seems to have, definitely still worth a watch for sure though.</fullReview>

It's fairly smart and quite well-made, and focuses more on the story and the characters than the effects and thrills - something lacking in the original War of the Worlds. The overlapping dialogue is almost Altmanesque at times, transcending this film beyond a typical 1950s studio system alien invasion flick, and the characters are interesting and well-developed. There's an unneeded romance subplot, and the reporter annoyed me to no ends, but it's briskly paced, snappily edited, and well-directed. It actually quite surprised me with its quality, considering how much I disliked The War of the Worlds, which is the better known of the two.</fullReview>

The Thing is older than these and in some way has Howard Hawks stamp on it so I expected it to be even better. Unfortunately I was disappointed.Them! and Body Snatchers were decidedly Grade B movies and looked it. This one deals with a Grade B theme, has a Grade B cast but has none of that cheesy 50's flavour. The writing is too polished, the build-up is very slow and the atmosphere one expects is missing.Its also pretty heavy on the political message (not that I mind) and assumes from the outset that all aliens are out to harm us and there is no talking with them - we can only watch the sky.If you want a sci-fi with good sfx go for the remake or the Alien movies. If you want a 50's sci-fi stick with Them! and Invasion of the Body Snatchers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a poignant film about the tragic consequences of first contact with alien life. The soldiers and scientists at a remote arctic base are wholly unprepared for their meeting with the alien life-form, and the results are predictably violent. Why was the alien here? What were its motives, its thoughts, its feelings? No one knows, since it is under attack from the moment it is thawed from a block of ice -- in fact, even before that, when the soldiers blow up its flying saucer.As I watched the film, I wondered if I was misreading it. Perhaps Howard Hawks intended the movie as a thriller, about a menacing, rampaging monster. However, that is clearly not the case. The alien is quite harmless until provoked, and everything it does is in self-defense. Its ship is destroyed, it is shot at, attacked by huskies, burned and electrocuted. Poor thing. Obviously the film is a not-so-subtle commentary on reactionary United States politics and cowboy diplomacy. The soldiers shoot first and ask questions later, with disastrous effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Always had great, vivid memories of The Thing, but having watched it after a gap of 30 years, it pains me to conclude that it is not a great horror/sci-fi flick. The required atmosphere that should inspire feelings of bleakness, profound loneliness, terror, and paranoia never is established. It is further undermined by compulsive wise-cracking that even takes the terror out of having (though never shown) 2 team members hanging upside down and drained of blood!. I was rooting for The Thing to take out the reporter. Well-acted, but it is afraid to go into the black depths that truly great 50s sci-fi do (e.g. Body Snatchers). Far too hollywood-ized with the bolted-on comic romance, relentless quips. Never establishes the atmosphere it should: people living in tunnels in a desolate place where no one can help them and facing an unknown, evil, and intelligent force, and not being able to even trust your companions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERSI expected quite a lot from this film(because of Howard Hawks)but it was a little bit disappointing.It has much inspired future sci-fi and horror movies and it has a great last shot but otherwise it is a very slow and pretty dull affair.The creature is a copy of the Monster of Frankenstein by the way.This film was very important for John Carpenter who made a remake of this film which is better if you ask me but not as good as his classic shockers HALLOWEEN and ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13.In HALLOWEEN we see the opening credits of THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD(great haunting score by Dimitri Tiomkin)and after that Carpenter would make the remake.Another important thing in THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD is the geiger counter which was later used as a heat seeker in the ALIEN series to great effect.So historically it is an important film but for people who want to watch great 50's science fiction I would rather recommend movies like THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL,THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN,PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE(yes it is a great movie),TARANTULA,THEM! and especially INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS which is the greatest science fiction film of the 1950's with it's superb ending. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before James Arness became Sheriff Matt Dillon, he played The Thing, an alien who crashes in the Arctic. Then of course, some people at a research facility thaw it out (stupid people!) and it goes on a rampage. Yadda yadda..."The Thing" was mostly just another Cold War movie. I guess that it's worth seeing for what it is. But overall, it's nothing that you haven't seen before. The scene with the dogs may disturb some people, but the movie is otherwise pretty hokey.As for Arness' assertion that the costume made him look like a carrot, it kinda did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know this legendary SF film enjoys the status of being an immortal horror classic, but?does it really, really deserve this? I'll be the last to claim it's a disappointing film but still, I feel there were other 50's SF classics that were better and deserve more praise. Like `The Day the Earth stood still', `Invasion of the Body Snatchers' or the magical `Creature from the Black Lagoon'. The Thing from etc?starts really slow and it actually takes too long before the first atmospheric and tense moments kick in. As soon as the alien life form is discovered, it's a nice action thriller with a few genuine scares and well-developed characters. An extraterrestrial spaceship crashes near an Arctic research center. The soldiers and scientists resident there accidentally make the ship explode but the alien pilot is still alive and frozen. When the visitor is thawed, they soon discover his intentions aren't peaceful. The main reason why I love these classic science fiction films is because they often contain brilliant scientific speeches about nature, mankind and biological intelligence. And usually, there's a good dose of healthy criticism towards human stupidity and greed as well! The Thing from another World focuses less on these aspects, but does guarantee a few terrific battle-sequences between men and superior alien (who actually is a vegetable feeding on blood). I think this film is rated this high because of the nostalgic memories many fans have about it?People like John Carpenter who remade it in 1982 as `The Thing'. Which is a very highly recommend film as well, by the way. If you're an admirer of the SF-genre, you definitely have to see it?if it were only to see how it all begun?All other audiences will appreciate this cheap, little film but won't remember it for long. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very flawed classic, but a product of its time, I guess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a sci-fi movie from the 50s, it is not really that risible. There is suspense, decent special effects, and plot that is not downright silly. There are two items though that subtract value from this movie in a very substantial way. First, the romantic subplot. This is totally irrelevant, adding nothing whatsoever to the movie. In fact, the romantic interludes are big nuisance and a distraction. Second, the way in which the top scientist is portrayed. As it happens all too often in movies, even these days, the guy is nothing but a sanctimonious, arrogant and dogmatic asshole. I can't help but wondering where the Hollywood people got this stereotype; having met lots of scientists myself, I have come across a (precious?) few that were indeed assholes, but not in the ridiculous way portrayed in this movie, but in more subtle and insidious fashions. In addition, the scene in which the secretary/girl reads the notes of the scientist in front of everybody is utterly ridiculous, bearing in mind that the scientist himself was present, but apparently too tired to do so himself. Oh, and finally, that of the idiotic journalist is a character that would not had been missed had he not been there.</fullReview>

It was only a few years after this that Lucy &amp; Desi bought the faltering studio.This film is a lot better than most of the 1950's Sci-Fi classics. It has a strong cast of serious acting talent including William Self who would go on to produce LOST IN SPACE in the 1960's.When old Matt Dillion gets torched with Kerosene &amp; then fried with Electricity its a good thing he does not have his shooting iron or he'd have taken out a few more with him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake's Rule!!!..............well, in this case ; )</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't you get fed up with people telling you to go watch the original?After seeing the brilliant remake by John Carpenter in my youth, I was tempted to watch the original and I eventually did on TV. OK, it must have been great for it's time but, come on, get real people! Those who say that it still looks great after all these years must have stopped watching other movies as soon as they left the theater after watching the original! John Carpenter's version is just so good, so unsettling, and those gross out creature effects make the original look so unscary and dated.So my advice as you can probably guess is, go see John Carpenter's remake and give the original a miss, which as I said before was probably scary in it's time, but is now a bunch of c!#p that wouldn't scare the most nervous of people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Talk...Talk...Talk...A Rare Time When I Prefer The Re-Make!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MORD39 RATING: *1/2 out of ****For anyone who knows my taste in horror and sci-fi movies, this is a rare chance to hear me contradict myself. When I say that the horror genre is DEAD in today's modern films, it comes as more of a surprise to me than anyone else when I say that THIS PICTURE IS AN OUTRIGHT BORE. THE 1982 JOHN CARPENTER VERSION BLOWS THIS "Classic" AWAY!!!Talk...talk...talk...talk....zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. I won't utilize a lot of space here praising the '82 remake, but I will say that it was terrifying simply by virtue of the fact that nobody knew who the Thing was, since it duplicated all life forms. Here we get a dumb-looking bald monster who does absolutely nothing of interest. I naturally prefer fifties sci-fi to anything else, yet I am totally immune to this sleeping pill.In my defense, even though I've made clear my dislike for "modern" horror, the year 1982 is actually pretty long ago by today's standards. The horror/sci-fi film endured at least until 1985. So, enjoy this one-time criticism of an old classic from me while you can. Is there a full moon or something?????</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven Horror/Sci-Fi classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A US scientific expedition posted at an Artic ice station discovers what looks like a spaceship in the ice. While trying to bring it up they accidentally destroy it, but they find its fellow occupant a couple meters away frozen in the ice. They bring it back to the base where the being unintentionally thaws out and causes havoc for the team. The scientists want to communicate to the being while the Air force troops want to destroy it. This causes friction and deception between the two groups, but there main problem is defending themselves from this menace.To begin with the film opens with such a great intro of the title of the film. Anyhow, the first time I saw the film I wasn't particularly fond of it (I had trouble staying awake), but this second viewing I've grown to appreciate it? a bit more. I'm still not hugely impressed, as not much really happens and there seems to be lack of surprises to maintain its running time. The setting of the film is rather dreary compared to its rich characters and clever dialogue - these things compensate for the slow plodded story that eventuates to not much. For some reason it seemed to concentrate more on the characters and that's not a bad thing as the characters have depth and their dialogue was cleverly sharp. There's a whole a lot of sarcasm evident too. Though, the conversations might be to the point and at times interesting, but the jabs of excitement and suspense were just too short with there being too many scenes centred on the characters standing around discussing what to do, which kind of bogged down the pace from time to time. Damn these meddling and selfish scientists thinking in the name of science than for humanity's sake! It just needed some added boost and at times the atmosphere just didn't hold up. With there being too many scenes staged in the well lit rooms and corridors of the station. Even the outdoor snow conditions and ice blizzards could've been used better. Saying that it did have its eerie moments, but that's when the monster or should I say vegetable on steroids was lurking on screen. The alien itself reminded me of Frankenstein and looked pretty good; it was just too bad that it didn't have much to do. Though, in J.W. Campbell's story 'Who Goes There' which the film is based on actually had the alien hidden in its victims and the same goes for its remake. Implied rather than graphic violence is used and it didn't worry me, but I just wish there was more action and chaos from our outer-space guest. Christian Nyby direction was inconsistent and there was speculation that he was helped out by Howard Hawks. And also it was rumoured that Orsan Wells added to the script. A forcefully effective music score adds anxiety and helps out the atmosphere to a great extend. To end it off the final showdown with the alien is full of energy, but it ends all too easily. Excellent performances from Kenneth Toby, Douglas Spencer, Robert Cornthwaite, Margaret Sheridan and James Arness as the imposing figure of "The Thing", add quite a bit live to the film. The cast seem to gel perfectly and they deliver rather appealing characters. You just got to love the concluding speech to end the film because it's a rather effective way to finish it. Keep watching the skies people!;)It's worth a look, but I still prefer John Carpenter's far more gripping and morbid version of "The Thing".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie tries hard, but has too many laughable situations to really be called "good". It does have mostly good performances and some decent dialog amid the silliness, however.&lt;&lt;SPOILERS to the end&gt;&gt;A round-shaped (of course!) flying saucer is discovered below the surface of the ice near the north pole. How it is determined to be "smooth, with no doors or windows" through the ice is a mystery to me - I can't see through an ice cube.Some air force guys blow up the ice with a "thermite" bomb, and unfortunately the frozen engine (!) of the saucer blows up (!) There is no fall out from the mushroom cloud onto the guys who are scarcely 100 feet away. Groan!Now, the guys look through the ice again (!) and see a large man-shape thing, about 8 feet tall. Even through the ice they can tell it is bald and has weird nails. Groan!They decide to chop a big block of ice out with the thing inside. Three people start whacking the ice with picks, and not a scratch do they make (this is not part of the plot - it just is a noticeable detail). They have to hurry because they only have an hour before the big storm blows in...Groan!So, OK, they get the thing back to base. The one guy designated to "guard" it unwittingly puts an electric blanket over the block. Drip drip drip melts the water (but the blanket never changes shape)...and the guard, who is now facing away and reading a book doesn't notice, but the huskies outside do (!) The guard finally notices the approaching shadow (complete with dramatic music) and shoots the unseen thing, then hysterically runs away, only to be "sobered up" with the cliched glass of water to the face. Groan!The thing is later compared to "some form of super carrot". Really.That's just the first 45 minutes. The other 42 I leave to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much verbal SCI it's boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Verdict : The original adaptation of J.W.Campbell's story "Who Goes There?." Much more scientifically sophisticated than Carpenter's horror-oriented remake from 30 years later. Unfortunately, rich dialogues create a rather downbeat atmosphere, which soon turns to boredom. The shock scenes are few and far between and before you know it, it's all over. It is difficult to avoid comparison with Carpenter's film, since it became much more culturally significant sf/horror classic.Pros : higher scientific sophistication, surprising "first encounter scenes" (if not too many), appropriate SFX (for the era) Cons : too many characters in the script with shallow personalities, too much unnecessary dialogue, illogical actions of the characters in danger</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like the cheap, 1950's, movie-mill SciFi's then this is for you. It has a few good moments, but cheesy overall. A lot of over-reacting, over-dramatized, bad acting as well. However, given the script I cannot blame the actors too much. The story line has very little to do with the original story 'Who Goes There' that was beautifully written by John W. Campbell. There are very few good special effects either. If you want to see something that is much closer to the original story then see John Carpenter's 'The Thing', 1982. It is fantastic and scary as heck! Although it is a modernized version, it uses a few scenes right from the book (blood jumping out of the petri-dish and screaming, yikes!). Most of the 1950's SciFi's were very low budget, filmed in a week, and probably written in a day. Unfortunately, this old classic is one of them (I use the term classic loosely here). Compared against a real classic like "Forbidden Planet",1956, this movie is a total dud! I think people give movies like this a good review because of nostalgia for that time period. But they were bad then, and they're bad now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is absolutely mediocre sci-fi with nothing at all to distinguish it from dozens of other similar films. Hawks' trademark snappy patter fails miserably here, with not one gag eliciting even a chuckle, and the actors quite noticeably pausing midstream to allow someone else to interject "spontaneously" with a limp witticism. The scientific basis for the story is as threadbare as it gets, and the sets and effects are as cheap as they come. The moral of the story seems to be threefold: 1) if you don't know what it is, shoot it; 2) scientists are stupid and weak; 3) women in the workplace are okay, but they really should settle down and get married after they've got it out of their system. Not satisfying on any level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "B" movie and nothing thrilling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is it because Howard Hawks is supposed to have directed most of this B movie that so many people acclaim it? I saw the movie on large screen and my effort was not redeemed.You wait half an hour before you get down to the nitty-gritty. Then you hope the corpse under ice will bring horror. But it's a ridiculous Karloff-like monster - actually making a spoiler warning here unnecessary. To make it less thrilling there's also a romance and a set of jokes between the nice dozen in the arctic base. The final scene is definitely not interesting. All the scientific background to explain The Thing may have helped to create fear in 1951. It's boring today, as is the cliché scientist eager to put science before humanity.John Carpenter's remake is umpteen times better:- Carpenter settles a real atmosphere with men stuck in a base, not in a studio where they can move easily and laugh.- The Thing is a real something, but I acknowledge special effects were not so good 30 years before.- Jokes and romance do not help create a fearful atmosphere.- The introductory back-story (what happened at the Norwegian base) is great to gradually build tension.- Then it's better that there are many victims for the survivors to feel really alone : in danger and helpless (? la Alien). The less the people, the less the talks and silence is a good starting point to arouse fear.</fullReview>

It also plants other little things so they can grow up to be big things, too. We have a whole bunch of people in a research/military shack up on the North Pole. The good-looking captain is always flirting with the skinny young thing (she's human - just a skinny young thing). They manage to flirt while people are dying and a 9-ft. tall monster is running amok. Then we have the scientist who lectures about evolution (do people still buy that??) and how The Thing evolved from vegetables. The irony is, The Thing is apparently not a vegetarian. The best special effects in this film are the scientist's pants - they are not of this earth. Then there's one of the actors who is around 6'8" and has a nose and chin that just jut out from his huge face and head. He's kind of like The Thing, only he's on our side. All the characters talk and talk and talk...they talk about everything...they joke, they tease, they wisecrack..staccato dialogue, no pause between talkers.....this movie is a complete waste of time. Oh, and the scientist claims that The Thing is far superior to us Earthlings ....so how come all he can say is, "Aaarrggghhhhh!" ????????? Total waste of time.</fullReview>
