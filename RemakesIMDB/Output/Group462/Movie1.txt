		<fullReview>* * * * ? (4? out of 5)The ThingDirected by: John Carpenter, 1982Looking back on John Carpenter's The Thing ? today a highly treasured cult favourite ? one has to wonder why it was dismissed by both the audience and critics when it first came out in 1982.Steven Spielberg's extra terrestrial adventure about a sweet alien that phoned home (that stole the hearts of both children and adults world wide) had opened just two weeks before and was on its historic box office rampage. Bad scheduling may have had a greater impact than anything else on the fate of Carpenter's first big studio effort for Universal Pictures. Nobody was prepared ? moreover wanted anything so dark, gory and scary as this genuine remake of the famous 1951 original. This was the time of E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial.It then makes for great movie history trivia, that The Thing has gained such a remarkable afterlife on video, DVD and television. Both financially and critically. Carpenter's version is less a remake of the Howard Hawks' version than a more faithful adaptation of John W. Campbell's short story "Who Goes There?' (on which both were based), and critics today point out how well Carpenter plays his characters against each other. Kurt Russell will never top this one, and he gets a brilliant sparring from the entire cast.It opens in Antarctica with a sled husky running from a pair of crazed and armed Norwegian men in a helicopter. The scene is long, slow and uneasy. It feels like the Apocalypse. It oozes doomsday.This scene comprises one of the greatest opening sequences in film history.Ennio Morricone's moody synth score (heavy on naked thumping bass lines in classic Carpenter style), the windswept massive white of the desolate polar ice and the majestic husky running across the tundra chased by the chopper, compromises a completely mesmerizing piece of scenery.A satisfying example of a movie that today ? 18 years after ? looks downright muscular in its simplicity.The budget was big ($14 mill), yet it allowed Carpenter to visualize his ideas better than ever before. There's a brooding darkness to this film, making the whites and blues of the icy Antarctic claustrophobia seem poetic and almost angelic. Dean Cundey's extraordinary photography created a palpable chill to every shot. The careful preparation (the crew went into a record 11-month pre-production) paid off immensely.Horror specialist Rob Bottin was handpicked for the many gory and grotesque special effects. Be warned ? there's a lot of splatter and gore here. The Thing is actually notorious for its creature morphing scenes. Some find them disgusting, some mere cult.An argument could be made against The Thing being an Alien rip-off; it has its origins in an old sci-fi story and it creates tension by popping a crowd of people (note: all-male) on an isolated outpost (an Antarctic research facility) terrorized by an alien life form.Where Carpenter was clearly inspired by Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece, his own alien movie is original and intriguing in its own right. There's a rhythm and an environment that equals Scott's in every way.The husky was in fact half-wolf and half-dog, and it was noted that it never barked or growled on or off the set (Horror Takes Shape, the making of - DVD version).Watch in awe at the scene where it walks through the hallway and stares at a human shadow, slightly tilting its head forward in stalking position like a wild wolf. This is a fine piece of animal training, sure, but that's not the point. This is as spooky as anything ever made in a horror movie.Carpenter had all the right tools here, and he utilized them to perfection, making The Thing his best movie alongside Halloween.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic that still holds up to this very day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I know I'm human. And if you were all these things, then you'd just attack me right now, so some of you are still human. This thing doesn't want to show itself, it wants to hide inside an imitation. It'll fight if it has to, but it's vulnerable out in the open. If it takes us over, then it has no more enemies, nobody left to kill it. And then it's won."John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of the most entertaining horror films ever made ? fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. This is how all movies of the genre should be made.Taking place in the Antarctic in 1982, the movie focuses specifically on a group of American scientists. We are given no introduction to their mission, but are thrust into their existence when a pair of seemingly crazy Norwegians appears at their base camp, chasing an escaped dog. The Norwegians are killed, and the dog finds its way into the colony, which is when things really start to get crazy.It is soon made quite clear that the "dog" is actually a shape-shifting alien organism, which manifests itself upon the physical form of its victims ? in other words, it begins to eat the Americans, and imitate them so well that the remaining humans cannot discern the difference between their friends and enemiesThe pack of scientists, led by MacReady (Kurt Russell), begin to fight for their own survival, using wits instead of brawn. If the Thing is indeed amongst them, then how are they to go about revealing it? How many Things are there? How can the Thing be killed? (Or can it be destroyed at all?)The creature's origins in the film are explained easily: Thirty thousand years ago a spacecraft plummeted to Earth, and was frozen in the Antarctic ice. The Thing tried to escape, and was discovered in the ice by the Norwegians, who unknowingly released it from its natural prison."The Thing," the movie itself, is similar to Ridley Scott's iconic "Alien" (1979). Many comparisons have been made ? the protagonists are stranded in a desolate area, stalked by a seldom seen foe that manages to kill them off one-by-one. However, "The Thing" ? for all practical purposes ? came first.Based on the famous short story "Who Goes There?" by John W. Campbell, Jr. (writing under pseudonym as Don A. Stuart), the film was originally adapted as a feature production in 1951 by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby. The result was "The Thing From Another World," an unarguable classic. But to be fair, it bore little resemblance to the short story, and Carpenter's remake does it more justice.The idea of the Thing being able to adapt the physicality of anyone is what essentially makes this movie so great, and is the most vital link to the short story. In 1951 the special effects were simply too poor to reasonably portray the shape-shifting organism, but thirty-one years brought many advances in SFX.Creature effects artist Rob Bottin does an excellent job of turning what could have easily become a cheesy gore-fest into a startlingly frightening (and realistic) mess of blood and fear. The Thing, although never actually taking one specific form, is constantly seen in a morphing stage, and the effects are simply superb. They still pack a punch twenty-two years later.Ennio Morricone's score (nominated for a Razzie Award at the time) is a bit too electronic and tinny, but nevertheless haunting when used correctly.From the fact that its cast consists entirely of males, to the fact that its ending is one of the most thought-provoking and untypical conclusions of all time, "The Thing" ? by any standards ? is unconventional Hollywood at its best. It comes as no surprise that, at the time of its release, "The Thing" performed poorly in theaters, and "E.T." ? released the same year and featuring a much kinder alien ? became the higher-grossing picture of the two (by far).In the long run, however, "The Thing" is superior in almost every conceivable way. Spielberg's tale is outdated and flopped during its 20th Anniversary Re-Release. "The Thing," on the other hand, has gradually climbed a ladder of cult classics ? it is one of the most famous non-famous movies ever made.Carpenter is notorious for having a very uneven career ? from his amazing "Assault on Precinct 13" (1976) to the magnificent "Halloween" (1978) to the disappointing and silly "Escape from L.A." (1996), "The Thing" remains his very best motion picture. Although its reputation over the years has never been honorary enough to land it a spot on most "great movies" lists, "The Thing" is still one of my favorite horror films, and ? upon close inspection ? masterfully crafted. It is a daring and ingenious thrill-ride that is simultaneously unique and chilling ? a genuine relief for film buffs who are tired of the same old horror knock-offs. This one, at the very least, is genuinely unpredictable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Timeless Look in Paranoia, a Horror Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just to put things in perspective for you before I get into my thoughts on this film, I am only 20 years old and have grown up in the era of CGI, blue screen effects...and this movie was made around the same time i was born.With that said, WOW, I only recently saw John Carpenter's version of 'The Thing', and what a masterpiece it truly is. I have long since been a fan of John Carpenter, in particular his works from the late 70's and 80's. In 'The Thing' John Carpenter has truly crafted a paranoia inducing, perhaps gut wrenching classic.The movie is an update of the classic 'The Thing From Outer Space', but only like it's predecessor, this film is in full color, and the characters of this film have much more to worry about than an alien veggieThe film centers around a group of Arctic Researchers you encounter an alien lifeform capable of taking the form of anything it comes into contact with, and out of for that matter. Kurt Russell stars as R.J. MacReady, an alcoholic Vietnam Vet, thrust into the role of leader of a group of relatively cold and callous men all of whom are readily plunging into manic paranoia and somewhat madness once they realize that they are up against a creature that can take any form, be any one of them.John Carpenter, more than in any other of his films, manages to create a truly believable and incredible atmosphere. When watching this film you truly get the sense of the dark,sinister, desolate surroundings, you feel and realize that these characters have no where to go...never for one second do you not believe they are stuck on a polar ice cap. Also, this film has perhaps one of the greatest endings to any film of it's genre, or any genre for that matter. I'm not going to give it away here, but to say that it will leave you wondering would be an understatement.Kurt Russell is superb as MacReady....truly conveying the emotions of a man thrust into a situation of unimaginable horror, forced to lead a group of men who cannot trust that the man next to them is not the creature that has driven them to the brink of paranoia and emotional meltdown.I don't care if this movie is 20 years old by now, the special effects in this movie are gut wrenching, mind blowing, and absolutely awesome. They blow away any CGI pixel based crap out there today. The 'Thing' itself is a truly horrifying and disturbing creation...unlike any alien you have ever seen in a movie before. Those who have a low tolerance for gore and blood had best prepare themselves for watching this movie.This movie does what any good horror/sci fi movie should do, it really thrusts you into it's character's world. It leaves you wondering, what would you do, who could you trust if anyone you knew could be the creature waiting to feed on you, and take you over as well. The images, and ideals of this movie stayed with me long after i first saw it, and today as i write this review send a chill up my spine.It is a true shame this movie is only now getting the proper recognition it deserves. A box office flop when released, now more then ever when movies are paper thin with plot, and one dimensional in effects, this film can be appreciated as a true masterpiece of sci/fi and horror.If possible, get the Collector's Edition DVD, and enjoy it in anamorphic widescreen..the way it is truly meant to be seen. Marvel at the incredible scenery, the taught direction, the excellent atmosphere, the sweat inducing, gag reflex activating, and everything else that makes this movie great.Watch it with the lights out, with a group of close friends...maybe even with a dog around...if you don't what i'm talking about...you will afterwards.Don't let a classic pass you bye</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally getting recognition.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am ashamed to say it, but I have to admit, the first time I saw this film was only about a year ago. After seeing it, I immediately rushed out and bought the DVD collectors' edition and have watched it many times since.The film is terrific on many levels. It works as your straight monster or action type film, as a horror/sci-fi and also as a very intriguing look into the human psyche. The incredible sense of paranoia, mistrust and fear, lent not only by Carpenter's direction (which is stunning) but also by the incredible acting of the cast in general. Kurt Russell (obviously) is spectacularly understated in the lead role of MacReady, and, as a direct result he "feels" like a real person, rather than a hollywood "all american hero". The other cast members all carry off their roles with style, and the net result is an intensely believable atmosphere, and a truly fantastic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another one of those films that I remember staying up late to watch on TV, scaring the crap out of myself at the impressionable age of 12 or so and dooming myself thereafter to a life of horror movie obsession. This is a GREAT movie, and stands as living proof that there were indeed realistic effects before CGI.Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them, making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and security found when human beings band together in spite of their differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules supreme. Who is the Thing?The gore effects here are absolutely amazing and messily realistic. I could have done without the dogs head splitting open like a banana peel, but that's just the animal lover in me being picky: kill all the humans you want, but leave the kitties and puppies alone. Sanity and reason disintegrate rapidly as, one by one, the humans are taken over by the shapeshifting alien. The power of this film lies in its paranoia, and although I liked the original version, I prefer this one; the real threat lies within, and is scarier for the fact that it cannot be seen or easily detected. When it is forced out of hiding, it's wrath is huge and the results are horrific.This is one of Carpenters best films, right up there with The Fog and Halloween. All of the actors give strong, realistic performances and the special effects are so powerful that they stand as their own main character. This film has something for any lover of the horror genre. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter's The Thing is hands down the best horror film ever made. Not only that, but it is also on of my personal favorite films of all time. What makes the movie so great? It's hard to put my finger on it. Everything just seems to work in The Thing, it's one of the rare occasions where everything just seems to fall in place. The film is even superior to Alien in creating a type of moody atmospheric hell. The fact that it's not only about the gore (which is wonderful btw), but it is able to create a paranoia that is unmatched in films. A truly wonderful film that is worshiped by all horror buffs, and anyone who has good taste in films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Antarctica, winter 1982. The team on an American research base get surprised by a couple of mad Norwegians who is chasing a dog with a helicopter, trying to kill it. All the Norwegians are killed and the Americans are left with nothing, but a dog, a couple of bodies and questions. That's the beginning of the greatest horror/thriller film I've ever seen.From the very beginning all to the end you feel the tense, paranoid mood. Helpless and alone out in no-mans land. Ennio Morricone was nominated for a Razzie Award for his score. Why I don't know 'cause as far as I can see his score is simple, creepy and very good. It really gets you in the right mood.The acting is great! The best performance is probably given by the dog who's just amazing. As for Russell and the others on two legs I can say nothing less.You may think 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive? Well, think again! You haven't seen it all until you've seen this. Bodyparts falling off and creatures changing forms... Rob Bottin has done a great job witch today stands as a milestone is special effects makeup.The movie didn't get a big response when it first hit the big screen due to other alien films at the time and so it's not very well known. In fact you can almost consider it an unknown movie. Nobody I've asked have heard of it. However the movie has managed to survive for over twenty years as a cult film on video and DVD. Twenty years is a long time and except for the haircut the movie is still pretty much up to date. This movie is to be considered a classic.The movie is without doubt one of my, if not my favorite. I've seen it several times, but it's just as good as the first time I saw it. As a Norwegian the only thing I don't like about this movie is that MacReady keeps calling the Norwegians swedes!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why The Thing?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people has got a film they think of as their favourite movie. My movie will always be John Carpenter's The Thing! The main reason why this movie is a cult-film is perhaps the splatter-effects created mainly by genius Rob Bottin and that this is the movie that made Kurt Russell what he is today (along with Escape from N.Y.) In my opinion, this is not a great film because of the effects, it has to do with the story, the atmosphere, and of course, the acting. I have watched thousands and thousands of movies (3-6 every day the last 10 years), but none has had the impact on me as this one, not even the great "Das Boot".Here's my suggestion to you who likes sci-fi and horror movies: Place yourself in the good chair of your home. Be sure you're not interupted by anyone. If you aint got a projector, sit close to your TV and watch this miracle of a film. Let it absorbe you, and you'll see it my way!Best View Time: Late February between 5 and 9 in the evening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Right up there with "Halloween"--one of Carpenter's best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remake of the classic 1951 "The Thing From Another World". 12 men are in a completely isolated station in Antartica. They are invaded by a thing from outer space--it devours and completely duplicates anything it chooses to. It starts off as a dog but gets loose--and has a chance to duplicate any of the men. Soon, nobody trusts anyone else--they're isolated--the radio is destroyed--their helicopter likewise. What are they going to do?The 1951 film had the thing just be a big, super human monster. That movie was scary. This one is too--but the story is different (and based more closely on the source material--the novelette "Who Goes There?") and it's scary in a different way. The movie starts right off with Ennio Morricone's extremely eerie score setting just the right tone and--when the Thing gets attacked--the amount of gore is astounding. There's blood and body parts flying all over--arms are bitten off, heads detach and--in the strongest one--one man is devoured face first by the Thing. The gore effects are STRONG and real nightmare material. I don't scare easy but I had to sleep with the lights on when I saw this originally back in 1982. Rob Bottin's effects are just incredible--how this picture got by with an R rating is beyond me!It also has a very creepy feel--gore aside, it is very suspenseful. You're not sure who is what and Carpenter's direction and the score really build up the tension. One complaint--no one is given any distinctive personality traits. They actors just remain straight-faced and say their lines. That's annoying...but the movie still works.This was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982--it competed with "E.T." and MANY critics complained about the amount of gore and there being no female characters in the movie. It's now considered one of John Carpenter's best. A must-see...for strong stomaches. NOT a date film!An amusing note: When this was released Universal sent a note along with all prints of the film. They suggested to theatre owners that they play the film in an auditorium near the rest rooms. They were afraid that people would be so sickened by the violence that they'd have to be close to a facility to throw up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flips the scenario round from the original to great effect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it the utmost respect that he possibly could, the only difference here is that Carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoiac core of John W Campbell Jr's short story.The secret to this version's success is the unbearable tension that builds up as the group of men become suspicious of each other, the strain of literally waiting to be taken over takes a fearful hold. Carpenter then manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery that's needed to keep the film heading in the right direction.Be it an horrific scene or a "what is in the shadow" sequence, the film is the perfect fusion of horror and sci-fi. The dialogue is laced with potency and viability for a group of men trying to keep it together under such duress, while Ennio Morricone's score is a wonderful eerie pulse beat that further racks up the sense of doom and paranoia seaming throughout the film.The cast are superb, a solid assembly line of actors led by Carpenter favourite Kurt Russell, whilst the effects used around the characters get the right amount of impact needed. But most of all it's the ending that is the crowning glory, an ending that doesn't pander to the norm and is incredibly fitting for what has gone on before it. Lets wait and see what happens indeed. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitting the video store late on a Saturday when all of the current films were unavailable, we ran across The Thing in the "classic" racks. I've seen this film at least twice before and truly enjoyed seeing it again. If it lacks plot or character development, the premise is frightening enough to make it an engrossing film. The gross-out special effects don't hurt either. For me, The Thing ranks with Alien as one of the best scary films I 've seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still my all time favorite sci-fi/horror!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The silly saying, "You can't touch this" surely applies here. With all the clone horror and sci-fi films coming out, along with all the inferior remakes, it's hard to find anything worthy of 2 hours of your time. That's why I always rely on the classics that scared the weewee out of me when I was a pre-teen.THE THING is, without an ounce of doubt in my mind, the goriest, ickiest, screechiest sci-fi horror classic that John Carpenter, or any other director (sorry, even you Mr. Spielberg) ever made. What really gives it power, though, is not the gore (it OOOOOZES of slime and blood and God knows what other fluids), but rather the sense of dread, isolation, and distrust it fosters in the characters and the viewer.You can't get more remote than Antarctica, and in this howling, freezing white setting is where the story takes place. Several Americans, researchers and military men, are stationed there. One day, they witness a Siberian Husky dog running for dear life from gun-wielding Norwegians. Before they know it, the American outpost is battling a mysterious creature that can imitate any creature it wants. It may morph into disgusting slimy bloody shapes before it's finished, but once it's finished, if you didn't see it in progress, you can't tell it among humans or other normal Earth animals.Kurt Russell, Keith David, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Donald Moffatt, TK Carter, Thomas Waites and Charles Hallahan are just a few of the fine cast. This film is the reason why horror CAN be a great genre. It actually STILL scares me. The alien blood "jumping" out of the petri dish when the hot wire touches it still makes ME jump!!!Still the scariest of them all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thing has to be one of the all time great movies. Of course it was ground breaking special effects at the time of it's release that impressed me so much, back in 1982 it just blew my mind, I'd never seen anything like that! However, although the effects themselves made the movie more horrific, it was the story itself, the music score , the claustrophobic atmosphere of the Anarctic as well as the interaction and tension between the members of the doomed research station that makes it a classic. Movies don't get any better than this! In the opening scene with the the chopper chasing this husky you just assume that it was some bored scientists from some station letting of some steam. Yet when you see them continue their chase at the US base you then think that the Norwegians are suffering from some form of advanced or extreme strain of cabin fever. Yet this is offset by the menacing opening music score that sets the tempo! You just know that something is not right! At this point it's a mystery until 'the thing' reveals itself. However, the mystery returns because it becomes a sort of Agatha Christie "who dunnit" ( i.e. ten little Indians movie) sci-fi style as the members don't know which one of their team is really an alien. Suspicion continues to go back and forward between them all as one by one they eventually get knocked off or revealed as the alien. The mistrust between the station crew is absorbing as the movie progresses until the final showdown.After 20 years of advances in computer graphics and film making production the special effects in "the Thing" don't carry the same weight as it did in 1982, but other than that it holds up very well all round with some great performances by the cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The last John Carpenter classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens. Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing. Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though The Thing debuted first. Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing in droves.Its not hard to see why. The two are diametrically opposed. One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart. The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us. I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience. As it should. Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake. It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways. Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien. And that's even rarer!Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did. It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation. But although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes. He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess). The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own. Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all. But a shape-changing alien. The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew. Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail. Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films. In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made. Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star. The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic. All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it. Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers. Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree. Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13. From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly. And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror. An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully. Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film. Amorphous shapes. Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles. Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!That type of thinking misses the point entirely. It only shortchanges the film's values. And there are many. Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to. Its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story. The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications. Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in The Thing. Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing. We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who. And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone. A pulsing thud thud every two seconds. It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake. The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation. The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic. Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved. An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received. And so much better than ET!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the classic Guy films. Horror sci fi as it was meant to be - a real story with good acting. Giving us something missing from almost all horror movies - depth and character. Providing a much needed respite from the cardboard cut outs pasted and slashed throughout, that have been filling the genre for decades. Which has given this style of movie-making it's well deserved reputation and status - of being both Invalid and Not Art. Though John Carpenter himself has been one of the staunchest purveyors of such ilk, it is my humble opinion that he did well with this one, and maybe two others.One of the best uses of curious as a tool, it lures you in a bit unexpectedly with a somewhat whimsical, almost playful beginning. Rich in atmosphere, while stark in landscape - you find yourself as intrigued by the people as you are the monster. The remoteness of the region gives a true sense of the isolation of the real life McMurdo Sound Naval Station (as it was called when I was in the Navy) which is on the very southern tip of Ross Island in the Antarctic, and is the portal for all things going to the South Pole. I think now it's simply known as McMurdo Station, with the story taking place at a small satellite station outside (probably fictional), as McMurdo is mentioned in the film.Kurt Russell who started acting as a kid when I was a kid has never taken Hollywood too seriously, which I've always thought was pretty cool. He's done his share of trash films over the years, but there's been a handful of roles that have more than demonstrated his caliber as one of our great actors. His version of Wyatt Earp is by far the most recognized and almost as good as George C. Scott's Patton. I said almost. He's the center of a strong cast of seasoned actors with many recognizable faces and solid performances. I watched it last night with a good friend who had never seen it, and it was just as good as when I first saw it in the theater - almost 30 yeeeaaars ago. Add it to your library, you'll watch it many times . .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the most professionally astute horror film of the 80's, very entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In following the lines of the classic formula to a point of taking another leap off from the material, The Thing remake becomes one of the coolest remakes of its time. John Carpenter fashions out of what must've been a fairly vague screenplay about certain things (or maybe very descriptive who knows), bringing forth incredibly wretched, brilliant puppetry and animatronics by Rob Bartin (with Stan Winston also on the team). These effects help set the tone against the harsh, detached environment Carpenter sets up with his characters. The film takes the story of a group stationed in a research bunker in the middle of an arctic climate, pitted against a malevolent force that takes the shapes of others. It's given a full life by Carpenter's choice of tones, and surprises. For someone following in the footsteps of Howard Hawks, the filmmaker here has a lot more trust and talent in executing the material than most given the chance to have another go with an old film.With the effects people working to full force- amid what would likely follow Backdraft as containing the most fire per scene (it could become overkill, but it all fits into the suspense after a while)- the actors pull along as a fine ensemble. Unlike the squad in Predator, these are mostly just regular working guys, with the leader coming in the from of Kurt Russell's MacCreedy (very good role for his style, excellent in fact). Juicy supporting roles are out for grabs for the likes of Wilford Brimley and Keith David. And it is refreshing to see how the sort of absurdity of what's going on in the film (an alien that starts off with dogs and then moves onto the others in gory, demented transforming form) is pit against such a tone of timing with everyone. I loved the long silences at times, with Ennio Morricone's spooky, curious music in the background (and that bass line is of merit in itself).It ranks up with being, if nothing else, delivering what it strives for for its genre/cult audience. It remains one of Carpenter's best; a rare breed of horror film where the story is told clear and precisely by way of the position of the camera, dialog, and timing with the scenes. That's not to say the film isn't chock full of violence, it is, and in fact a couple of times it's almost funny. But given that it goes back to what is ridiculously seeming like a by-gone era, the creatures/make-up, alongside the steady, well-calculated script, was done completely without CGI. It's disgusting, but it's real, and atmospheric to a T.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ten things about The Thing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1) Despite Carpenter also giving us the greatness of Halloween, The Fog, Escape From New York, Assault On Precinct 13 and more, this movie is an absolute classic of the horror genre.2) It's a remake, based on the Christian Nyby/Howard Hawks movie "The Thing From Another World" and the story THAT was based on, "Who Goes There?" by John W. Campbell Jr. The original movie was briefly shown on TV as part of the Halloween line-up the kids watch in . . . Halloween.3) Thanks to the amazing work of Rob Bottin it features some of the best special effects work ever, all stuff that holds up to this day. Nasty, visceral, alien and eye-poppingly impressive.4) The Carpenter-esque, minimal synth score was by Ennio Morricone, a fact I often forget while enjoying the movie.5) It has an all-male cast and all of them are never less than great, with Kurt Russell, Keith David and Wilford Brimley standing out amongst an ensemble cast of sheer class.6) Beyond the blood and guts on screen, there are some interesting ideas here about identity, a sense of self and a "trust no one" attitude that would, of course, become the watchwords of X-Files fans at the turn of the twenty-first century.7) There has been a video game developed from the movie's premise (approximately 20 years after the movie was released) and it's surprisingly good.8) Contains one of my favourite ever lines: "I know you gentlemen have been through a lot, but when you find the time, I'd rather not spend the rest of this winter TIED TO THIS F*-&amp;KING COUCH!" 9) In a year dominated by Spielberg's little, friendly E.T. it was not great news at the box office for The Thing but home video and subsequent word of mouth saw it become a much-loved film by horror fans and deservedly so, in my opinion.10) I first saw The Thing at the tender age of twelve years old. On a small, black and white TV. With a lot of static. While eating a curry. Despite the lack of a crystal clear screen I still could not eat my curry. Needless to say, that's now a cherished memory within my twisted Thing-loving psyche.See this if you like: The Thing From Another World, Alien, Invasion Of The Body Snatchers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This "Thing" DELIVERS!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OMG! "The Thing" is John Carpenters masterpiece! I watched this movie fore the first time last night; alone, in my darkened basement and it scared the living hella outta me! This movie ROCKS! Somehow, "The Thing" always eluded me. I never knew much about it and never really had an interest in it until I started doing a little research on the internet of horror/sci-fi movies I had not seen.First off, "The Thing" holds up marvelously 23 years after its release! In fact, this movie could probably be re-released today and make a ton of money. It's just THAT good. With so many of our classic horror movies being re-made these days; I doubt that this film will ever be re-made anytime soon because it just still plays so very well.Well written, acted, &amp; shot, "The Thing" is one heck of a gore fest. The graphic violence in the "The Thing" is just amazingly shocking, realistic, and awesome! Quick plot summary: A US research team working in the Antarctic comes across a Norwegian base that has been deserted. They find a dead and deformed body and take it back for research. The end up learning that something has attacked the Norwegians and is somehow shape-shifting with detailed precision into a predatory killer. By researching the evidence left behind by the Norwegians, they find a space ship that looks like it crashed in the snow some time ago.They soon realize they are being stalked, and it could be anyone of the team. They began to lose all trust and confidence in each other and quickly began to turn against their colleagues.Will they find WHO amongst them is a "Thing"? Can anyone kill this creature before it wipes them all out and infects our entire civilization? Kurt Russel rounds out a very nice cast of actors in this fantastic thrill ride. I was very impressed and satisfied with John Carpenter's "The Thing".I cant recommend this movie enough! Enjoy!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Thing" is John Carpenter's masterpiece and one of the best classic horror films!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic film. John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of the most entertaining horror films ever made ? fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. This is how all movies of the genre should be made. Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them, making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and security found when human beings band together in spite of their differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules supreme. Who is the Thing?Seriously I Love this movie I love it To Death. I love Escape From New York and I love Escape From L.A. but I also love The Thing so much better this is definitely the best Carpenter film a truly masterpiece classic I love R.J. MacReady - Kurt Russell I love everything about this film that is. Science Fiction, Horror and an Action Epic Film. A lot of the practical effects were left out but the it looked nice and the acting was good and it expanded upon the monsters background and showing you the inside of the ship. It must of been tough to bring across on screen the visual design. In my opinion, nobody has topped this film in the 25-odd years since its release. I'll put any of "The Thing's" old-school effects up against any CGI-driven movie, or this cast against almost any other ensemble. If you haven't seen the film yet, I envy you because I WISH I could see "The Thing" again for the first time. WOW! Does more need to be said? How about this...there is no parallel. Who's your friend? Who's the Thing? Who do you trust? Who can you afford to trust? If you've never seen this movie...your in for a treat. The only other movie that had such an impact on me was The Matrix (the first movie)...where I left the theater touching the walls wondering if they were really real. This movie will leaving you wondering....is the guy/gal next to you really real?"Trust is a tough thing to come by these days." John Carpenter's The Thing is a seminal piece of horror that is not only a fine specimen of its era, but it also serves as a shining example of horror done absolutely right in any era. Combining gross-out special effects reminiscent of Hellraiser, the nail-bitingly intense, claustrophobic filmmaking of Alien, offering a story that is very well-paced, such as George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, and presenting the idea that true terror can be found at any time, in any place, and inside anyone, much like Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, The Thing works on every level, and represents the peak of each and every aspect that may be utilized to make horror films effective. Granted, this amalgamation of styles is not the only formula for winning horror.The basic plot about this movie is Horror-moister John Carpenter (Halloween, Escape from New York) teams Kurt Russell's outstanding performance with incredible visuals to build this chilling version of the classic The Thing. In the winter of 1982, a twelve-man research team at a remote Antarctic research station discovers an alien buried in the snow for over 100,000 years. Once unfrozen, the form-changing alien wreaks havoc, creates terror and becomes one of them.The Thing (also known as John Carpenter's The Thing) is a 1982 American science fiction horror film directed by John Carpenter, written by Bill Lancaster, and starring Kurt Russell. It is one of the best favorite horror films of the 80's ever. I love this film to death. The Thing is the best classic horror film from master and genius John Carpenter! 'The Thing' is classic Carpenter and one of the few remakes that is better than the original. Kurt Russell's characters: Snake Plissken, R.J. MacReady and Jack Burton are Kurt's best favorite characters he ever played. I also love the music score from Ennio Morricone! Awesome!!!10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Universal Pictures Starring: Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, Keith David, T.K.

		<fullReview>It's nearly Halloween and if your thinking of a movie compilation this should be the top of your list.It centers around a group working at a research outpost in the Antarctic, one day there's an attack on the outpost from another research team upon venturing to the other base that housed the team they discover the outpost was destroyed by an organism that can mimic any living creature.When they return to the outpost they shorty discover the organism has infected the base and they can't tell who isn't what they say they are. This is where this films real horror lies the people who you think you can trust i.e. your friends are the people who try and rip your throat out so the enemy becomes your sense of trust.The special effects are amazing I recently was able to see a digital presentation of The Thing at the cinema and it looked awesome, usually when you watch this film because its shot against white you get glare on your screen very easily, in the cinema the lighting is set perfectly to prevent glare it really does look a lot better I recommend seeing it on the big screen for anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Warning, I spoil the entire movie.) The Thing is all about... well ya know, the Thing. What is the Thing? An alien, but what kind of alien? I dunno, but it sure is ugly. It's pretty awesome because it can infest people and make them grotesque alien monstrosities. Every little piece of the alien becomes a new, little alien, i.e. one of the victims who is assimilated gets decapitated and his head becomes a spider monster.What am I going on about? The film is set in Antartica and revolves around 12 American scientists who start getting assimilated One -by-one they get Thinged until only 2 are left alive and the ending is left ambiguous as to their fates. (I think they probably froze to death.)The Thing has been frozen in the Antartic for thousands of years before being awakened by a Norwegian science team. It kills all but two who're killed in the opening of the film at the American base. Throughout the flick it tries to rebuild it's space ship, which to me proves it was the pilot and was planning on flying away home, where ever that is. However the Americans decide to kill it and they do so with fire! I love sci-fi; I love horror. I especially love it when the two get mixedand mixed well. I like to think of The Thing as a well shaken vodkamartini of awesomeness. It's my personal favorite horror flick, it has an influence on me as a (wannabe) filmmaker in that It's OK to have disgusting, mutating monsters. I like to know my world has a healthy dose of grotesque, evil beasts from another planet. That makes me happy.What the hell am I talking about now? Anyway, I hope you've seen it already if you're still reading. (Sorry if you haven't.) Peace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thing: 2nd Greatest Horror Film Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ThingI'm going to give the full review using my standard formula. Let's Begin.This is in my opinion the 2nd greatest horror film ever only inferior to Alien. The movie is a loose remake of the horror classic The Thing From Another World. But for those who say all remakes sucks, try and answer to this. This movie is in my opinion superior to the original. The alien is much more unique, and because of this it's a lot scarier. Not to say the original wasn't scary.Plot: The plot is great. 12 men in Antarctica see a Norwegian shooting at a dog. They kill the shooter, and take the dog in. I am just setting you up, I won't get anymore into it than that.Acting: The acting is great. I only recognized two people in this movie, Kurt Russell and Keith Davids. Kurt Russell gave a superb performance as MacReady, a helicopter pilot who must cope with the madness growing in his friends. Everyone gave a great performance in this movie. Using an all male cast everyone gave a convincing performance with fear, anxiety, mental instability, and a loss of trust for best friends.Horror: Like my title says, in my opinion this is the 2nd greatest horror film ever made inferior only to Alien. John Carpenter gives the perfect idea of fear with an alien who takes control of an organism's body and makes a perfect imitation, looking and sounding like the person, remembering the same thing the person or animal remembers, and acting the same way as well. This goes into the scariest part of the movie, the loss of trust between best friends. As the movie goes along you see the former friends attempting to murder, interrogate, and coerce each other. Also the idea of being isolated in Antarctica is the perfect idea for a horror film. The special effects are great. Rob Bottin did an amazing job with this movie. He started by making sketches of things that had never been done before. He did them and made them spectacular. The music was a very underrated part of the movie. Ennio Morricine made a fabulous score which helped make the movie scary like Halloween.In my opinion this even beats out horror classics like Halloween and The Birds. It provided a scary premise with a bit taken from the original and the rest taken from the short story. For big horror fans, see this movie right away. If you are truly a horror fan you will see the genius of this horror film. Even if you're not a big horror fan you will see the genius of this movie.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily Carpenter's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Thing' came out in 1982. Back then, John Carpenter was already a quite famous director, with hits like 'Assault on Precinct 13' or 'Halloween'. And with the success of 1981's 'Escape from New York, Universal Studios gave Carpenter a free pass to adapt John W. Campbell Jr.'s short story 'Who Goes There?'. The problem is that 'The Thing' came out only two weeks after Steven Spielberg's 'E.T.: The Extra- Terrestrial'. Therefore, 'The Thing' was a massive fail with the public, and also didn't go well with the critics, saying it was too gore and violent. Now, 28 years have passed, and 'The Thing' acquired a cult status, having the recognition it always deserved - as the best John Carpenter movie. 'The Thing' follows a group of American researchers in Antarctica that are confronted by a blood-thirsty alien creature that assumes the identity of whoever it kills. Now, they don't know who to thrust, and if the other researchers are human or alien. The movie's screenplay is based on a short story by John W. Campbell. Written in 1951, and adapted firstly for the big screen in the same year, this story clearly represents the fear of communists taking over America. But Carpenter's movie came out in 1982, so the Cold War fear is long gone, and he adapts the story in a much more present way. The paranoia subject here is also treated very nicely. The feeling of getting stuck with an alien and to don't know in who to trust builds up along the movie perfectly. There are a few things still unexplained about the movie's story, which proves how well-written this is and also explains why there are so many fans of this. The writing here also allowed John Carpenter to create some of the most scary sequences ever.The cast here is not very big and is composed only by males, and is headed by Kurt Russell, back then a rising star that also had the leading role in Carpenter's previous movie, 'Escape from New York'. He does his job pretty well, as so did all the other actors. Of course this isn't the kind of movie that depends on the acting in order to work - it's all about the writing and the directing. Aside from Russell, that aren't many famous actors, maybe with the exception of Keith David. A name that is worth mentioning is Wilford Brimley. He was certainly the best member of the cast.John Carpenter's directing work is, as always, incredible. He has a very strong style, that is present in every single frame of this movie. He manages to create completely scary sequences out of the nowhere, and it's his directing that keeps the movie going. The movie, like every Carpenter one, has that claustrophobic feel to it, and the way Carpenter handles the characters is simply amazing. The opening sequence - with the helicopter chasing the dog, is one of the best opening sequences in the horror movie industry - it settled the mood perfectly, and showed this was no ordinary horror film.The mood in here is also built by all the other aspects of the movie. The creature design is one of the best in movie's history, and the animations are perfect. As there was no CGI, the movie utilizes makeup to create the illusion of the creatures, and is considered until today a landmark on makeup special effects. It couldn't be better. Ennio Morricone's original music score also did it pretty well, with the use of bass chords pretty common on Carpenter's previous films. The cinematography is also excellent, with a dark and scary mood.Overral, 'The Thing' is easily John Carpenter's best movie. The reception of the movie when it first came out wasn't really fair to what this movie is. But now, 28 years after the release, people finally realized how good this movie is, acquiring a well-deserved cult status. The excellent writing, along with the good acting and Carpenter's perfect directing make this one of the best and most scary horror movies ever made. 10/10</fullReview>

The fact that the extraordinary special effects stand up against most modern day CGI is only a small part of why this movie is, finally, rightfully regarded as a masterpiece. Technically brilliant in its camera-work and editing, superbly scripted and acted, one of the best openings, one of the best endings, tension and paranoia sustained throughout (with countless viewings), an excellent soundtrack, and open to multiple readings and analogy, there simply aren't enough superlatives to do this film justice.

		<shortDescription>Cool concept, bad execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a concept it's rather brilliant actually, but it's a shame that the idea never really goes anywhere. The film features a one trick pony with it's main antagonist being a shape-shifting alien that can take over a host in every way and if it evolves to a point it becomes completely indistinguishable from the original. The story quickly abandons any attempt at adding depth to this premise while thoroughly exploiting the scare potential of such a "character". Instead the shape-shifting alien is reduced to just a killer and is exploited for gory thrills and horror scares, but mostly it's just gross. The storytelling is sparse and visually uninteresting. The snow and ice is never really a factor and while it makes for beautiful scenery, but other than that the film looks really plain. The special effects are pretty damn impressive, but what's the use when they serve no other function. The acting is your typical stoic man on a mission fare, and no real emotions or character arcs are explored. Everything about this film is pedestrian and therefore it should be skipped.</fullReview>

We soon learn that this dog is actually the carrier for some intergalactic "Thing" that can change into anything it touches, well attempts to in some cases. AEWSOME special effects and gore; I love gory films, and almost lost my cereal on this gem. I strongly recommend watching the Collectible Edition with some hour or more of added behind the scenes of the movie including the special effects. Kurt Russell does a wonderful job with his style of witty humor (pouring his whiskey into a computer's motherboard after he loses to it over a game of chess). His lead role really sets the mood for this movie's "entrapment" feeling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a sort of Matrix for many modern films about aliens. It has antecedents for sure but they did not have enough special effects and big enough budgets enabling them not to show the zipper in the back of the monsters. The original element is the location: the Antarctica. A place that has been re-used since by a certain Predator when he met with some Aliens of a more recent generation. There, if an alien life form that can penetrate any living organism and take it over completely appears it can disrupt any human group so much that they will self destroy in order to destroy the alien thing forgetting that anyway the alien form can survive even centuries of glaciation because it is not human or animal and hence it is not even sensitive to cold. The alien is always the winner and it will sooner or later manage to learn how to be patient, penetrate a living organism and stay rampant in it long enough to be taken to real society, to millions of people concentrated in small areas That's the idea of the film. And it ends the way it has to end. Two apparently human beings are still alive. One is contaminated, probably not two, but they are going to die of cold in their human form, their human organism. Carpenter even makes one black and the other white and the circumstances he uses makes the black one dubious, suspicious, whereas the white one seems to be the normal one, but who really knows? The alien or aliens will go dormant in the cold, in hibernation. There is no escape, no end. Our human world is bound to be taken over not by more intelligent beings but by biologically more advanced life forms. And we may wonder if our intelligence will be enough to compensate for the handicap.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate in alien terror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of explorers in the arctic region have encountered a vicious alien organism that can consume a person and make itself a perfect copy. This is a classic horror film that is loaded with brilliant special effects and graphic violence that is a perfect way to spend a cold evening. Kurt Russel stars as a troubled alcoholic who takes charge and tries to find which person is really the alien creature. One of the most brilliant things about the movie is that it plays with the idea of not knowing who you can trust. I found it interesting that it had an all male cast, something uncommon for many movies. The acting is very natural and very realistic. This movie was surprisingly scary and the graphic scenes were surprisingly horrific. It's a dark, brutal, and claustrophobic sci-fi horror film that has stood the test of time from the genius of John Carpenter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror movies ever, finally getting recognition.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you 're not reading this comment just to feel assured that there are other people in this world who share your good taste in films, do yourself a favor and watch this movie immediately. This would have probably been the best horror movie ever, if it wasn't for Ridley Scott's masterpiece (Alien). But I would say, "The Thing" really gives "Alien" a run for its money, we are talking about the cream of the crop of the horror/sci-fi category. It also easily qualifies as one of the best movies ever, regardless of genre. John Carpenter is a master of horror movie-making and here we find him at the pinnacle of his creative powers (although I consider "Starman" to be even better, but this isn't a horror film and it's another story). Top-notch performances from the all-male cast across the board, a-grade screen writing, stunning visuals and cinematography, and of course Carpenter's impeccable direction combine into a spellbinding, nightmarish tale of a would-be apocalypse unlike any"thing" you have seen before. When I first checked to see how "The Thing" was doing on the IMDb scoreboard, back in 2001, I was disappointed to see it was hovering somewhere about 5.9 - 6.0. Most of the comments where not very good either, with a few exceptions. I was more than pleased to see this movie gaining more and more appreciation over the years. As I see now, it is among the top 250, with a score above 8.0 and with a good reason: It is certainly one of the greatest horror movies in history, which went under the radar for many years, until it finally achieved the cult status it deserved in the first place.I was about 9 year old when I first watched this movie, late at night on TV - perfect conditions and age group to watch a film like that. Needless to say, I was scared to death! It took a long time until I watched it again, but the way I could remember all key scenes was a sign of the profound impact it had on me as a kid. Right from the haunting title sequence (which I think was later also copied in "Predator") to the spectacular gore scenes, to the chilling sense of isolation and impending doom created by the gloomy score. Since then I have re-watched it many many times and I have to admit, it is perfect material for repeated viewing. More than a quarter of a century after its first (failed) release, witnessing the quality of what was supposed to be a b-movie of the 80's really puts most films shot today to shame. The detail and attention that went into the production design is truly amazing. The whole antarctic environment is replicated with tremendous accuracy. You can feel the cold and isolation of this barren white wasteland where the story is taking place and this is pivotal in creating the menacing, paranoia-inducing, claustrophobic atmosphere that permeates the film from start to finish.The story itself is quite unconventional, based on an acclaimed novella from 1938. A team of scientists stationed in Antarctica face an alien life form, found buried in the ice, which upon thawed has the ability to consume other living organisms (including people) and imitate them perfectly. The film concentrates around the fear, mistrust and communication breakdown that ensues between the members of the team, once they realize they are isolated from the outside world, unable to get help and with one or more of them possibly not being human. The way the dynamics of the team is presented and the realistic depiction of their reactions makes the movie transcend its original premise as just a horror/sci-fi film and become something much deeper and profound. I am always amazed by the realistic behavior of each member, despite the unrealistic setup. You see people be afraid and some even break down, but you don't get you regular unstable guy who freaks out and tries to kill everybody. Kurt Russel gives a career-making performance, while the rest of the cast also does an excellent job. All around, a terrific ensemble piece. There is also a large amount of carefully timed quality gore, that is utterly mind-blowing. Rob Bottin, the man mainly responsible for the animatronic (although also Stan Winston was also involved in the animatronic work) and make-up redefined the state of the art of what was possible, producing some of the best gore sequences ever that remain unmatched even today. What's more, these effects are really terrifying because they look and feel real and life-like. CGI is nemesis for a horror movie and "The Thing" is living proof that if you plan to shoot even a remotely scary scene, make sure you stick to good old latex and makeup.Special mention should also go to Ennio Moriccone's haunting score. I can't believe it was actually nominated for a Razzie! Morricone produced some extremely effective underscore for the suspense-building scenes of the film, communicating all the paranoia of the isolated team and the otherworldly, alien presence that lurks in dark places, waiting to take hold.Overall, I cannot recommend this movie more strongly. It is a rare combination of unparalleled atmosphere, unconventional story and inspired visuals which has stood the test of time admirably.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is how a movie is made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I vote this movie ten out of ten because of the great cast and also the great suspenseful creepy feel of the film the whole deep undertones of the score of the movie keeps you very interested in whats going to happen next every time I watch it. You can tell that Mr. Carpenter had his heart and soul imposed in this tale of great suspense and horror. He was a genius when it came to that. Really wish movies were made like this today instead of props they use CGI which is hollow and see through, especially in lighted scenes CGI looks totally fake but in this film the special effects were so real looking that it still amazes me today. Kurt Russel is so spectacular in this movie I just want to keep watching.You could really tell that there was chemistry on the set between the actors in this film. A perfect combination of great talent great directing and great film work. I always love revisiting this horror classic remake of the original black and white film. Has so much more power than the original because back then Hollywood was so afraid of the world and as I watch old films that are in black and white it's almost as though they dumb down the audiences even though they were much smarter than they thought. Hollywood was different back then they couldn't do anything remotely bold on screen back then because of being afraid it would get banned. Well in this version Hollywood has evolved thanks to movies like the Exorcist,Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Alien. They have become much more liberal.That's the reason why this film works so well, it's because Mr. Carpenter took a movie and did the things that the original directors couldn't do like add gore and more abstract ideas because back then they couldn't. Another reason why it works is because it's a great story to tell, just ask the question what would you do in this situation stranded in the middle of nowhere being attacked by an organism that adapts to everything it touches. That's what makes this classic retelling so good it's just a movie that has a simple idea and let's the paranoia grow in your mind. Knowing that if the thing touches you your life is going to be mimicked into something that you do not know. I will always love this version don't care about future remakes won't watch it because they will just fill it with CGI and actors from popular teen dramas that's all Hollywood cares about now is how popular the actors are. They don't care about real story telling anymore all they care about is money and popularity. Screw that I'll stick with the classics until they realize what people like and crave so screw Hollywood they don't know how to make pictures anymore it's not about the art it's about cheap thrown together remakes and what makes a quick buck screw'em I'll just keep watching these great masterpieces when they still loved to make a great movie and put their heart and soul into it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter's The Thing Is a great classic that not that many people have seen today and for those how have seen this you know what I mean. What makes this film so great is that its so different from any movie I have ever seen. For the most part horror films have bad story telling, bad acting and is usually just bad. Thats not The Thing, The Thing is really a true masterpiece. Everything about it is just perfect, the acting, the directing, the writing just everything about this movie is perfect. The best thing about this movie would have to be the atmosphere in this movie. It feels like your in the middle of nowhere and this thing is around imitating things. I mean it could be anyone it could be you and you wont even Know that its you infected. The musical score by Ennio Morricone is spectacular and one of the best ever. The main part of the score is just to very low bass notes that just puts you in the awkward feeling that you know something bad is going to happen. The acting by everyone is very well done and is believable by everyone. The directing by John Carpenter is pitch perfect, I had never really like John Carpenter directing in any of his movies Until I saw this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An equal to Alien</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This stands next to Alien and Invasion of the Body Snatchers '78 as one of the great horror/sci-fi hybrids of the era. The film takes place in an American research base in Antarctica. A Norwegian helicopter chases an escaped sled dog into camp, shooting at it with a rifle. When the shooter wounds one of the Americans, they kill him in self-defense. It's probably not the smartest move, seeing as how insanely the Norwegians were trying to kill it, but the Americans take the dog in. Little do they know it's not a dog at all, but an alien life form mimicking a dog. Soon it reveals its true form ? kind of ? and is burned to death. Unfortunately, it's a crafty organism and has likely infected one or more of the men. But how could you know? It's a perfect mimic, pretty much undetectable until it's too late. The film features some of the best special effects of its time ? they have not dated a bit, and are every bit as creepy and nasty as they were in 1982. The monster, when it reveals itself, is a true Lovecraftian thing that takes on all kinds of forms, probably an amalgam of the different organisms it has mimicked over its lifetime. Put the monster aside, though, and there's this great, intense study of paranoia. "Nobody trusts anybody" as star Kurt Russell puts it. Reminiscent of perhaps The Big Sleep, if you closely scrutinize the series of events, the plot makes no sense. There's no conceivable way the persons who eventually end up as the thing could have become it. But this lack of logic itself is part of why the movie is so horrifying. You never can tell who is or who is not an alien. Carpenter wisely never lets the audience see anything. Kudos to him for that. And also kudos to him for including two black characters who don't die in the first ten minutes of the movie, an almost unheard of feat for an African American person in a 1980s (or '90s or even '00s) horror movie! A masterpiece of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thing is in my humble opinion maybe the greatest of all of Carpenter's films. It's great on so many levels, I'm having trouble deciding what I will start with.All right, first of all, the story is great. We follow a group of researchers, on expedition in Antarctica, far away from civilization. The thought of being helpless in freezing cold conditions without the chance of getting any help is disturbing enough. And as an extra layer of complexity, we have the paranoia and mind-bending element of who-can-I-trust?. Since the group is faced with a never-before seen threat that spreads like a virus no-one knows what to do or who to trust. And the longer times go, and the more of the crew gets tainted by the alien, the more the paranoia grows. I think essentially why I love this movie so much is because I always try and imagine myself in their situation. Would I panic? Would I turn into MacReady or would I become "the thing"? I get goose bumps just thinking about it.The score, for once not made by John Carpenter, is really really good. We usually hear Ennio Morricone's music in western movies, but he has done a tremendous job with the music to The Thing. Since the music is so essential to the feeling of a certain film, the composer has a crucial task upon him. Morricone made it with brilliance and finesse, and the mood of the picture hits you right at the first credits. Awesome!So the special effects might not be comparable with todays CGI technology. That doesn't matter, really, in my opinion. It's not only the realism in monsters that decide how good the scares are in all horror movies. Really good horror movies can always depend on the mood setting, the story and the (un)expectation from the viewer. And those things are all as good as they can be in The Thing. Also, the effects aren't bad to begin with, I just wanted to prove a point.The ending is fantastic. MacReady does the right thing, and ends the film being a hero. He knew his life (or any other's) couldn't be saved, but instead of crawling into a corner and cry like a little baby he did the only right thing. He went out and put an end to the whole thing by blowing up the place, leaving nothing but the bister winter to keep him company (and Childs who cared to show up some explosions too late). When the end credits roll I'm really impressed by this movie. It has me captured frame-by-frame all through the runtime every time I see it. The Thing undoubtedly has an important quality -- it makes you think and it makes you involved, and it makes you want to watch compellingly all the way to the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To the many of you, who like me, gave this film a 10 out of 10 I cannot top your favorable reviews of this masterpiece and I do agree with almost everything you say, so I'll address the comparisons with E.T. made the same year..1982. These 2 films, although Sci-Fi are actually in different genres. E.T. is "Sci-Fi Lite" much like Starman, Star Trek, Star Wars, Back to the Future 3 and Galaxy Quest to mention a few. They are warm, funny in some cases, awe inspiring and fascinating. E.T. delivers 100 fold in its genre and is definitely a 10 and a classic. John Carpenter's The Thing is "Sci-Fi Horror" much like Alien, Aliens, Bloodsucker and Lifeforce, etc. As a horror flick it delivers with jaw-dropping effects, jump out of your seat action and palm sweating tension, and it, too, delivers 100 fold. It is a classic, still holds up after 25 years and is 10 out of 10. Both are masterpieces and it's not fair to compare them. It'd be like comparing pie &amp; cake. Post Script: I would highly recommend viewing this film on Blu-Ray DVD as it looks spectacular. Children 13 or younger should not see this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a note-perfect film, from beginning to end. From the snowy, desolation of the Research Outpost to the gloriously realized special effects, there isn't one moment of misstep in this whole film. Sublime casting and a truly satisfying ending cement this film as one of the greatest ever made.You will be on the edge of your seat during the "petry dish" test scene. Giving more away would be too much a spoiler. You did see it parodied on South Park (perhaps) last night, but in the context of this paranoic film, it's the best scene of many outstanding scenes.I've had the pleasure of seeing the 50's original on the big screen. John Carpenter purportedly idolizes Howard Hawks, but he surpasses his hero with this "remake." The 1950's version is something special, a time-capsule treasure of Hollywood's yesteryear - Carpenter's The Thing is the essential telling of the story.Enjoy for all the years to come. It will leave you in chills.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget E.T, The Thing is The Real Alien Film of 1982.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's brilliantly suspenseful flick is a great fusion of Sci-Fi and horror, adopting the classic body-swap theme and taking it to the extreme. A remake of the Howard Hawks produced 1951 original, Carpenter keeps the Cold-War themes of paranoia and trust as a backdrop of alien takeover and impending doom amidst madness and the isolation of the Antarctic setting. Carpenter's direction as always is excellent as his camera glides through the lonely world of the characters whose inhabitable environment is about to be corrupted by the primordial fear of body takeover. But here and much like the work of David Cronenberg, Carpenter doesn't hold back on the incident, as through some fantastic special effects we are witness to some insane moments of surreal gore. However, he never loses touch with the human side of the story, as in the face of everything shocking happening in front of us, we are left with perceived notions of trust and suspicion.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first night I watched this film I had a genuine nightmare. No film before or since has given me nightmares and this illustrates how powerful this dynamic film is. The setting is isolated in the wastes of oblivion, the music a echo to the primal heartbeat of human fear, the violence and gore gritty and realistic, the absence of special effects for the better. But what I find so brilliant about this film is its systematic annihilation of one of the core human emotions which is trust. This film brilliantly replaces this void with pure and undistilled paranoia, and in the context of this film this becomes far more powerful than any other weapon to terrify audiences. Combine this with the perpetual mental and physical isolation that this film creates and you have a masterpiece of not just science fiction horror but of human fear. And will leave you looking over your shoulders for what lurks in the darkness - Trust me.If you liked this try the shinning 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of a gross out film than a well-crafted horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thing is a 1982 sci-fi horror film directed by John Carpenter and stars Kurt Russell as Mack MacReady, a researcher based in Antarctica and our protagonist in the film. Upon its release, The Thing was met with a lot of mixed reviews and overall a negative reception, however over the years has gone on to gain a cult following and a legendary status in the history of sci-fi, horror and cinema as a whole. While The Thing does have its moments, as in the grand special effects of the horrific, repulsive monster itself which still don't look particularly dated by todays standards and the great sense of vulnerability in our characters. It is in these characters that lies the problem. Not one of them is particularly likable or relatable, even Kurt Russell himself. You never get a great sense of caring or hoping for a certain character to make it out alive, rooting for a character just doesn't happen in The Thing. We are also left hanging in the balance by the end of the film with no real climactic epic fight or showdown. The Thing can be tense and generally scary at times, but in reality is a pure gross-out film rather than a well crafted horror. The music however is another strong point which does add to the suspense and the very clever idea of blood samples in the latter part of the film really has us guessing and wondering who is human and who is the monster. While I don't agree the statement that The Thing is one of the greatest horror movies of all time, it does have its tense, pseudo horror moments and shrieking horror soundtrack to build on this. Overall it does feel more of a gross-out, gore-fest with unfortunately unlikeable characters, some rushed scenes and disappointing third act which leaves it feeling incomplete, but with brilliant special effects. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If the tag-line for ALIEN was "In space no one can hear you scream", then THE THING might have a tag-line that read: "In Antarctica, no one can hear you scream." Originally, The Thing started life as a novella called WHO GOES THERE? by John W. Campbell. In 1951, Howard Hawks made a loosely-based version called THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD. It became a classic, bridging the gap between sci-fi and horror, displaying a cast of witty and smart characters and an infuriatingly tough alien. Then in the early 80s, John Carpenter and his crew set out to remake THE THING. Many viewers who had seen the earlier film were put off by it, remarking on the graphic content. What many viewers may not have known is that John Carpenter's version is much closer to the source material. Having read the book, I must admit it was quite original. Now the story: In Antarctica, a US scientific team take in a dog that's running from a couple of Norwegians. However, nothing is as it seems... Not wanting to reveal too many details, let's just say The Thing appears and terrorizes the team. Many of the graphic deaths and mutations remain intact from the book, as well as the claustrophobic locations and growing sense of dread and suspicion. Kurt Russell (a John Carpenter regular) plays the role of R.J. MacReady perfectly, as do the rest of the cast (many of whom are veteran actors). The dripping, nauseating special effects are some of the creepiest ever filmed. And mercifully, Carpenter allows the film to retain the book's terrifying, downbeat ending. For you, the gentle bloodthirsty viewer, there's a little something for everyone to find scary in this one. So make this required viewing, and if you're an avid reader, hunt down WHO GOES THERE? It's equally as strong!!!</fullReview>

This movie did follow the original but it followed the novel much more because now the monster takes on the body of others whereas in the original it looked slightly like the frankenstein monster all in all this movie was really well done and a worthy remake but i have heard that their going to remake it again and i hope they don't do that because too many movies are being remade lets leave these to movies the way they are and don't remake then again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proof that once upon a time John Carpenter was a fine filmmaker (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first watched it, I wasn't terribly impressed by The Thing. I can't recall precisely what I didn't like about it, that first viewing being maybe a decade or so ago, but I seem to remember finding it a little confusing and I can remember not being a fan of the special effects (some would consider that last statement heresy). But watching it a second time, I enjoyed it immensely. I wouldn't place it at the top of the genre like some people would, but it wouldn't be far off.First things first, I appreciated the special effects a lot more this time round. I think the problem when I first watched it was just how bizarre it all was. Tentacles? Bloody flower guts? Giant snapping mouths? Maybe I found it hard to suspend my disbelief, or perhaps I found it repulsive ? I don't mind gore in horror films, but I'm not a fan of what I'd call 'gloop' (for some reason I can happily watch limbs get blown and sawn off, or see people get shot, stabbed and eaten, but my sick trigger is sensitive to 'gloopy' film monsters ? I love David Cronenberg's version of The Fly, even though it does make my stomach turn in a couple of places, but I do actually come close to gagging watching The Fly II, and not just because it's cinematic manure). So perhaps I didn't appreciate the special effects for those reasons. But they're actually pretty great. One of the best bits has to be when an imitation human head sprouts a tentacle from its mouth and pulls itself along ? and earlier on when the head begins to detach itself from its body. It's nasty and unpleasant and great to watch. And then there's the bit when Palmer's face rips apart and a giant alien mouth sprouts and bites a guy in the head. Neat. (And to make it even better, the man who's getting bitten is shaken from side to side, and in a couple of shots it's obviously a dummy?which is amusing.) But not all the special effects work is great. Although I love the head being ripped off and I love it when it shoots a tentacle from its mouth, it does look silly rather than disturbing when it sprouts antennae and spidery legs. There's a fine line between great and crap. And the bit at the end isn't particularly impressive either ? the bit where we see huge tentacles and a massive monster. It's overkill and the effects don't match what has come before.Much better than all the big stuff are the little bits. Right at the end, right before the silly tentacle business and the unconvincing alien dog, is a bit where Garry encounters an assimilated Blair and Blair sticks his hand in his head. It's brilliantly done. And then after that you see Blair dragging Garry along by his face. Again it's sick and nasty, but in a much more believable way.However, it's not the monster that makes The Thing such an enjoyable film, it's the confusion and the paranoia that its presence generates in the humans (I guess when I first watched it as a kid I didn't realise that confusion was the point). After all, seeing as The Thing is a shape-shifter, and it can take on any form, everyone's a suspect.This climate of paranoia and suspicion is best illustrated in the scene where MacReady (Kurt Russell) ties the surviving scientists and workers to chairs so that he can check their blood to see who's human and who's not. The scene really is tense, as you haven't got a clue who's been assimilated and who hasn't. You're not even sure if MacReady is who he says he is, as even he's been built up as a suspect. But it literally could be anybody and the scene's a powder keg.Another great scene is when MacReady declares that he knows for certain he's human and the camera slowly pans across the rest of the group. Do we believe him, and who among the group isn't what he says he is? As well as the scenes of tension, I love the creepy moments too (they're often a lot better than the 'scary' bits). My favourite is when a half assimilated Bennings is caught trying to escape the camp (he's almost a perfect copy but his hands are deformed) and he lets off an eerie howl before he's burnt to a crisp (there's a lot of torching in the film?which I love!). And there's also the bit where MacReady visits Blair, who's been locked in the tool shed. MacReady opens a slit and Blair's sitting there by a noose while eating cans of food. He then begs to be let out. He insists that he's much better. It's a superb scene. And as simple as they are, I love all the lingering shots of the dog. It's a creepy mutt, I tell you. It's got a thousand yard stare.Also rather creepy is the ending. After all the pyrotechnics, MacReady thinks he's the sole survivor, only Childs shows up. His explanation is that he got lost in the snow. There's a bit of an awkward conversation, and even though Mac kind of knows that it isn't the real Childs, he's become tired and resigned to his fate and shares a smoke. It's an ending that, in the best way, keeps you wondering.And on a final note, I must say how much I enjoy Mac's snow-sombrero and his bad geography. "Hey Sweden!" he shouts when he visits a Norwegian camp. The film's funny, too, and intentionally so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter's Sci-Fi/Horror Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie at the ripe old age of 9, I was beyond terrified. John Carpenter's sci-fi horror masterpiece about a shapeshifting alien gave me nightmares for years. After another 30 years and about 50 more viewings, it isn't frightening to me anymore, but that hasn't diminished the value of this tense and suspenseful classic. The critics liked Starman more, and Halloween was more influential, but The Thing is John Carpenter's best movie ? no frigging contest. Considering how many great movies Carpenter made in the '70s and '80s, that's saying a lot.In the late '70s and early '80s, the horror genre hit its peak. Ideas were still fresh, but the taboos that kept the truly horrifying movies like The Shining and The Exorcist off the screen were gone. Young directors like John Carpenter brought inspiration and energy to the medium. Without $100 Million CG animation budgets, directors were free to focus on storytelling and script. This is the stage in which the film industry found itself when Carpenter made The Thing. The script is almost air tight, leaving virtually no plot holes or loose threads, other than a couple of mysteries that are better left unanswered. The cast was perfect, and the direction was excellent. Most of the actors were no-namer types who didn't do much after The Thing, but there are no weak performances in this film. The soundtrack is also a huge asset to the film. I still get chills whenever I hear it during the introduction and over the closing credits.Best of all is Rob Bottin's absolutely incredible work on the film's visual and special effects. The monsters don't get a ton of screen time, but when they do, they are gruesome and horrifying. The practical effects in the movie still trump any computer generated garbage that has been made in the past 15 years. Although they are a product of a wild imagination, the monsters in the movie seem incredibly real, and because they seem so real, they are also threatening. In the recent 2011 prequel, the monsters simply weren't as scary, in large part because you couldn't shake the idea that you were watching a high-tech cartoon.The movie begins with two crazy-looking guys hunting a dog from a helicopter, shooting at it as it flees across the Antarctic. It is one of the best opening scenes of all time, drawing you in immediately. There is a whole rich backstory at work, and at the start of The Thing, you get to see the aftermath. After the dog incident, the story unfolds almost like a Lovecraftian version of "Ten Little Indians". Once The Thing is first truly revealed, the rest of the movie is filled with tense paranoia and fear. Adding to the tension is the extreme isolation of Antarctica, and the knowledge that nobody can come to rescue the scientists. All the while, we realize that these men are not the only ones in danger. If the Thing kills them all and escapes the continent, the world is doomed. At one point, The Thing also gives you the best jump scare in the history of film. I have introduced this movie to about a half dozen people, and the "test" scene has made somebody jump out of his or her chair every time.Another of the great qualities of this film is the memorable cast of characters. Even though there are lots of them, they all look, sound, and behave differently enough for you to get to know them almost immediately. After only one viewing, you can probably remember that there was the cowboy-ish MacReady, the cook on roller skates, the guy who loved dogs more than people, Wilford Brimley going crazy, the doctor, the weak-willed radio operator, the crazy guy, and the big tough looking black guy. Unlike almost every other horror movie with a body count, every death feels significant, because even minor characters are well developed.In my humble opinion, The Thing is one of the Top 10 greatest movies ever made, and the #1 movie of its genre. This is why the movie has such a strong cult following despite its lukewarm reception on release, and why if you see it for the first time, you will probably still enjoy it even though it is 30 years old. If you want to see the best of the true horror genre (i.e. not the idiotic slasher genre misclassified as "horror"), The Thing is absolutely essential viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Flawless Horror Classic. Carpenter's Greatest Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's The Thing is in my opinion the Greatest horror film ever made. A brilliant mixture of great direction,acting,special effects,score and screenplay making this a all time classic horror film. This is Carpenter's greatest film and It's not only my all time favorite Horror film it's one of my favorite films of all time period.The Thing tells the story of 12 researchers in a u.s outpost in Antarctica with nothing really happening until the researchers discover that an alien that came to earth years before is stalking them and killing them and imitating them. Which raises the question:Who can you trust?Released in the Summer of 1982,John Carpenter's The Thing came out at a bad time having been released three weeks after Director Steven Spielberg's Blockbuster E.T. The Extra Terrestrial a much lighter take on Alien life and The Thing was ignored by audiences and hated by critics. Thankfully,The Thing has become a Cult Film and is now considered a classic and one of the best Horror films of all-time and the praise is rightfully deserved. The Thing is a film I love for many reasons because it brilliantly works as Horror film and Remake. One of the reasons I love the film besides the direction and special effects is the paranoia aspect of the film and when the characters stop trusting each other and start wondering who's human and who's not and Carpenter creates a dark end of the world feeling where the end will come from either aliens or man's own disturbing self destruction. The film is scary and frightening not just because of the effects and atmosphere but because of the characters and how they react when the alien invasion happens. It's very believable,scary and gives the film it's edge. This film was released before AIDS and HIV was more known around the world and Carpenter's film could be a metaphor. Even though The Thing is a Horror film,the issues and themes of fear,paranoia and distrust is still relevant in today's world.The screenplay by Bill Lancaster is superb and well-written giving the film and characters great lines and dialog. We don't know much about the characters and who they are but,we know them well enough to feel sorry for them and don't paint the characters as faceless victims. The snow and cold adds to the dark and frightening claustrophobic feel of the film and you feel isolated like the films characters where you feel that there's no where to go and no salvation for the men. The only film that can match the chilling and dark atmosphere is Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. Both films in my opinion are the two of the most terrifying films ever set in the winter and make me never,ever want to stay in a house or a hotel by myself in the snow. The Thing also succeeds as a remake and one of the rare occasions where the remake was different and better than the original.Where in Howard Hawks The Thing From Another World the alien was a big and large Frankenstein-like creature,The Thing in this film looks different every time it transforms so the alien can look and different and sound different each time and it's very inventive and terrifying. The Thing was the first in Carpenter's great apocalypse trilogy which also includes other Carpenter classics Prince Of Darkness and In The Mouth Of Madness. While none of these three films have nothing in common in terms of story lines or characters the thing they all have in common is the concept about the end of the world. The Thing is my favorite and the best of the trilogy because of the storyline themes,characters and great ending which has been discussed for many years. The Thing also moves at a fast pace and never slows down until the very end. The violence and gore in the film are intense and brutal truly match the horrifying tone of the film and the violence happens you as the viewer will feel it and will be disturbed. The ending of The Thing is uncompromising,dark and will have viewers talking about the ending for years,leaving you with many unanswered questions than easy answers and wouldn't fly in today's Hollywood and it's one of my all time favorite movie endings and one of the reasons the film is truly brilliant and why I love The Thing. The whole cast does a great job in their roles. Kurt Russell is excellent as R.J MacReady,the man who becomes the leader when things fall apart. A.Wilford Brimley is great as Dr Blair the doctor who goes crazy. Keith David is wonderful as Childs and is tough as nails. Donald Moffat is effective as Garry bringing depth and sympathy to the role. T.K Carter is great as Nauls and brings some humor to the film. Richard Dysart(Dr.Copper),David Clennon(Palmer),Richard Masur(Clark),Charles Hallahan(Norris),Thomas Waites(Windows),Joel Polis(Fuchs)and Peter Maloney(Bennings)give great performances as well.The direction by John Carpenter is brilliant because Carpenter is always moving the camera giving the film a since of dread,eeriness and doom of not knowing what's going to happen or where. Great direction by Carpenter.The score by Ennio Morricone is frightening and scary and matches the dark,grim tone of the film. One of Morricone's best scores.The special effects by Rob Bottin are excellent some of the most ingenious,bloody,gory imaginative effects in film history. Shocking,surprising and unexpected,Bottin's effects set the standard for make-up effects still hold up years later.In final word,John Carpenter's The Thing is a flawless Horror classic that is amazing from beginning to end and is a film that belongs in every Horror fan and movie buffs collection and is John Carpenter's greatest film. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter's special effects classic delivers a sense of isolation and paranoia.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the classic John Carpenter re-visitation/tribute to the original 'The Thing From Another World' which was adapted from John W. Campbell's book, 'Who Goes There?', and it begins like a slick and subtle action in the Antarctic movie just before it gradually develops into a spectacle of mind-blowing special effects and paranoid tension.Kurt Russell, Keith David and Wilford Brimley are among the occupants of a remote research station in the Antarctic when they discover the remains of an alien creature frozen in the ice that is able to assimilate any living organism by reproducing its cell-structure. This premise provides Carpenter with the perfect disposition to build an overwhelming sense of distrust, for anyone could possibly be 'The Thing', and Rob Bottin's make-up crew magically provides some of the most amazing creature effects that still haven't been matched to this day, making this one of the most ghastly science fiction movies ever made. Carpenter has a knack for creating music and tone that induces a feeling of uneasiness and dread, and the William Lancaster script focuses on suspense rather than dialog and characterization. The most memorable and terrifying scenes include; A dog that is actually the alien is abruptly stopped just as it is about to imitate the other dogs in the first scene where the creature shows itself, and not to forget to mention the infamous "spider head" scene which for many is the film's most gruesome highlight. This is one of the great films that forged itself timelessly from the world of nightmares and unknown horrors, and will remain as a major contribution to monster effects history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely amazing entry without any real flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of scientists at an Arctic research base find themselves under attack by a shape-shifting alien creature that mimics anything it touches, leading them to struggle to know who's-who in the fight against the creature.This is a wonderfully impressive and utterly fun entry, with a lot to love about it. The fact that it manages to capture an incredibly suspenseful atmosphere, from the extreme isolation of the situation to a series of brilliant set-pieces at the end to ensure that it'll be impossible to determine who's what when it comes down to figuring out the identity of the alien in disguise amongst them. Chief among these, and a film highlight in its own sense, is the classic blood-test sequence, which is just marvelously done and never once gives away it's secret twist, which is highly creative and makes the film all the better when it's followed by a scene of incredible imagination with its disembodied head gag. It's a running theme throughout the film, of intense suspense followed by rather impressive special effects to punctuate it, all done convincingly and never really allowed to dominate one way over the other in the film. It's action is unparalleled, as the finale is a huge fire-filled battle in the basement, and it's never clear who will win out, and earlier battles are just as impressive as the film utilizes a rather oft-overlooked technique of making something to be feared known to loose in a situation where they can't escape, using the situation to its advantage throughout and never letting it go. Even the gore is impressive, offering tons of splatter to shoot across with reckless abandon and making for a never-ending series of great kills. One of the most impressive films in the genre.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and animals-in-peril</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just edges out Alien as the finest Sci Fi/Horror film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is, and will likely remain, one of my favourite movies. It's as near perfect within it's genre as any movie I've ever seen. The cast, the sets, the script, the special effects: all excellent.To my mind, there are two ways to make a really entertaining horror film. Play it straight, or throw in a heavy element of comedy. This movie plays it straight right down the line, although that's not to say there aren't a few laughs to be had, there are some classic lines of dialogue.The movie's soundtrack and score establish a sense of foreboding from the get go, and as the characters witness one scene of unimaginable horror after another, the fear and paranoia grows palpably. The imagination and thought put into the special effects lifts the movie to a level as yet unsurpassed, Rob Bottin deserved an Oscar for his work here, with an honourable mention going to Stan Winston who stepped in to alleviate the workload, providing a particularly memourable scene.I can't believe I didn't see this at the cinema at the time of it's release. This is partly down to the critics, who should hang their heads in shame for panning this film. But beyond that, the trailer was awful, failing completely to convey the brilliance on display here.Another criticism levelled at this movie is there are no female cast members, but there really wasn't any need for them. The last thing this movie needed is a romantic sub plot.Much as I love Alien, I prefer this. To quote John Carpenter, this monster isn't just some guy in a suit. This is the best of the best.You've probably seen this movie already, but if not and you like horror (particularly of a Lovecraftian flavour), I urge you do so at the earliest opportunity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic, one of the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this is one of the best sci-fi horror movies ever. The setting is brilliant, the isolation is total and the paranoia feels believable. The creature itself without giving too much away has a very simple and understandable desire to survive. You can imagine if it had ended up somewhere less remote and although you get little information about its origins it doesn't matter because like the aliens in the movie Aliens you know enough about it to know it's damn scary.The effects have held up fairly well, there are bits that still make me jump but the point is that it's a very well told story and the characters are likable and though thinly sketched also feel like real people. I loved this movie and I have watched it many times since it came out, if you haven't seen it then treat yourself to a night of quality entertainment.I'd rate this gem as highly as Aliens, it's simply brilliant and the dogs acting easily beats most of Hollywoods current 'talent' hands or paws down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paranoid Winter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the very beginning we all realize that is going to be a long and difficult winter for all the men of the research station in Antarctica. Besides the fact that must be really frustrating to be working in a station like that without your family and women, the winter looks even more difficult in part because now they can't make a communication with anybody so practically nobody will hear their screams. That cold and lonely environment is perfect for the story of this film, story of paranoia, human behaviour and unknown things. That aspect of the unknown things is brilliant, first everything starts with an unusual situation: a Norwegian helicopter is pursuing a Siberian husky, trying to kill it. Not knowing why that Norwegian went crazy shooting everywhere, the men of the station kill him and the dog stays there. And since then they start to investigate, first to know more about the Norwegian station and later to know more about a thing that was defrost. Of course thanks to their science skills they obtain great information about what was really the dog and how that thing is able to imitate other life forms. Now the paranoia begins with everybody trying to survive and not trusting in anybody. Here the best part of the film begins with that thing that could be anybody. Of course every team has a leader, here is RJ MacReady (Kurt Russell) who is the helicopter pilot and definitely the smartest and the only who still can think about a possible solution, also realizing that the thing is trying to survive just like them. The last part is just great with the "still humans" knowing that they are not going to survive but with the hope that they can take with them the thing. In the end the only thing they can do is to wait there for a little while?see what happens."The Thing" was the first studio film made by Carpenter but it was released just after "E.T." back in 1982 and was a theatrical failure but definitely is a terrific film with many great visual scenes; of course the ones when the thing appears are my favourites. The cast is also pretty good with Russell in his best days, just after his escape from New York and now with more hair and beard ala Morrison. The rest of the team is good too and is odd that there aren't women in the entire cast.Conclusion: "The Thing" is just another great film of John Carpenter that gained more audience with the video, laser-disc and DVD releases. In these days when in America there is nothing but remakes of the classics, remakes of Asian films, prequels &amp; sequels, mixes between two films and stuff, is almost a fact that another remake of a Carpenter film is coming. Now this film is probably going to be remade and if the thing will be just like in the past years, after seeing the remake where are going to re-watch this 1982 version just to take off the bad taste in our mouths. It's true that this film is also a remake but in this case is more faithful to the original story and is just great.Region 4 DVD: Although the box doesn't say this is the single-disc collector's edition of "The Thing". It contains many bonus materials: the really interesting and informative 80 minutes documentary "John Carpenter's The Thing: Terror Takes Shape" (the only problem with this documentary is that it doesn't contain Spanish subtitles), the classic director commentary also with Kurt Russell, Production Background with the description of settings and characters, photos of the cast, Production Art and Storyboards (great concept sketches), Location Design, Production Archives, Outtakes and two scenes(frame by frame and full motion), Post Production (cool photos of the premier and posters), Production Notes, Cast and Filmmakers, Theatrical trailer. THAT'S A DVD!</fullReview>

Over the years THE THING as made a cult following from video and t.v sales and as many new fans.

		<fullReview>I will try not to repeat the points made in the many excellent reviews above, but on viewing this over the last few years I have come to regard it as a truly outstanding film, certainly a classic and arguably deserving a position in the pantheon of greatest films of all time. The original was also fine, but like Shakespeare, Carpenter and his colleagues have taken an existing plot to a new level. There are no weaknesses in cinematography, acting, effects, human drama or science fiction concept. There is a certain amount of shock effect, but an impressive feature is the additional horror produced by the concept of the predicament of the ice station crew and by extension, humanity. The obvious comparison is with "Invasion of the Body Snatchers", and I would be hard put to insert a credit card between them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember peeking into this movie in the movie theatre when I was too young to see it- and seeing the most famous scene right at that moment. I was both shocked and scarred and excited at the same time- this was a movie that had just short circuited me- I had to see the rest of it!And I did- and I have watched it several times since then. I have also watched the interviews with the director etc...Carpenter has made some CRAP films in his day. This is not one of them- and in the interviews he blames short schedules and low budgets for the crappiness of some of his films (not in so many words) and judging by this masterpiece of science fiction horror I think he's onto something. Give John Carpenter enough time and money to do it- and he'll do it right!The Thing is based on a science fiction novel called "Who Goes There" and was inspired by Carpenter's repetitive viewing of an earlier film of the same title- but this version is a thousand times better, scarier, and also much more true to the original written story and it also captures such an awesome feeling of isolation and spookiness with the scenery and the camera angles and lighting.What can I say- it's a masterpiece.PLOT: A number of scientists and their support team are out in the arctic doing research- one day a crazy Norwegian shows up wanting to kill a friendly dog. They keep the dog.big mistake. What ensues next is a captivating tale of horror and suspense with special effects that still hold up to today's standards- more than 20 damn years later. I can't praise this film enough. It is a classic for the genre that has already stood the test of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another well-loved horror masterpiece from director John Carpenter is this unforgettable re-imagining of the 1951 sci-fi classic The Thing From Another World. Scientists stationed at an outpost on the South Pole are terrorized by a mysterious shape-shifting alien.Themes of paranoia, the unknown, and isolation are very common in the horror/scifi genre and they are well utilized in this film. John Carpenter directs this film with gusto, giving it a terrificly haunting and bleak atmosphere. Ennio Morricone adds all the more to the atmospheric spookiness with his eerie music score. However, the best highlight of The Thing is undoubtedly the awesome special FX of Rob Bottin. Even by today's standards of CGI visual FX, the creature creations of Bottin are truly outstanding. This film was made nearly 25 years ago and still the creepy alien FX of The Thing manage to shock and thrill! An impressive feat indeed.Another highlight is the great cast of the film, the best of which is hero Kurt Russell in one of his most challenging roles.All around, The Thing is a stunning combination of moody atmosphere and out-of-this-world horrors. It remains as one of Carpenter's best films and stands as one of the greatest alien-horror films out there! **** out of ****</fullReview>

It shape-shifts into whatever it kills and then it kills again.Carpenter achieves Horror in two ways, one is the very Graphic Alien Scenes, which are both Horrific and very Visual. The other method he uses is far more subtle and effective, he shows us into the Psyche of the Potential Victims, their Fear and Paranoia are captured wonderfully, creating some great moments of Suspense and Tension.The Cast all deliver good performances and Kurt Russell gives a performance that is very different to his all action Snake type role.

		<fullReview>This is one of John Carpenter's best movie if not his best! In My opinion it is one of the best films to date! I don't want to spoil it for you if you haven't seen it yet but here I will say the following! Kurt Russell was very good! The other cast members including Wilford Brimley, Richard A. Dysart, Keith David, Donald Moffat, Charles Hallahan, and Richard Masur performed well! The movie has many thrilling moments and it does a great job at keeping you in suspense! I just love the unpredictableness! The film is very interesting and is quite scary at times! It has some gore and great effects! In My opinion in the very beginning before the credits where you see the space ship coming toward Earth is one of the greatest special effects of all time and then you see the fantastic Thing logo with such chilling music which is one of the greatest title sequences ever! Morricone's score is very good and it has that great John Carpenter sound! Carpenter directed this greatly and I love how he remade the scenes of the ship in the ice and the hole in the ice block that belonged to the missing corpse! The artwork on the movie box is excellent! If you love John Carpenter, Kurt Russell, the other cast members mentioned above, horror, action, sci-fi, thrilling, suspense, and alien movies then this is the perfect movie to watch!

		<shortDescription>Paranoia in Antarctica</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Paranoia, paranoia, everybody's coming to get me!" Harvey Danger, Flagpole Sitta John Carpenter's "The Thing" is a remake of the 1950's classic science fiction movie where in his updated version, paranoia has never gotten so creepy. After his 1978 movie "Halloween" where horror pictures proved that evil will never die, Carpenter takes evil to a whole new game.Set in the Antarctica region where like "Alien," nobody would hear anybody scream, a group of researchers doing God-knows-what happen to stumble upon a Norwegian rifleman shooting at a dog where after the gunman is shot down, questions are being asked by the group including the no nonsense pilot R.J. MacReady (Kurt Russell) in which they see more what they bargain for.During the film after an attack scene involving an alien dog, the investigation group fears that something has hit them and will never get out. Paranoia leads to fear, fear leads to questioning and those seeking questions will finally have their answers.John Carpenter's The Thing is a "don't turn off the lights" movie where even during it's time despite the fact that E.T. hogged all the credits, it proves to be a classic thriller from icky special effects to make you either scream or shield your mouth to scenes that you'll remember in your nightmares.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At a remote Antarctic research station a twelve-man American research party encounter some crazy Norwegians chasing a dog near their campsite. After shooting one of their team members, the Norwegian is shot dead. Trying to discover what made them turn out like this they head to their station, but instead they find something of unknown origin slightly burned up outside in the snow. They bring it back to find out that it's some sort of alien form that's fused together human parts. After more research into it they find out it was buried in the ice for centuries and that it's an aggressive shape-shifter. Soon enough it starts imitating the inhabitants of the base. Causing strained tension and hostile confrontations as everyone starts to turn on each other.Halloween might have been my first John Carpenter experience, but it was this one, which blew me away and got me really into the horror genre. "The Thing" used to always get played on late night TV and I never missed the opportunity to sit up and watch it. I always believed that it's the best time to watch this cult classic and on this occasion I did the same again, but I had to watch it on DVD this time around. Since this basically bombed at the box-office, because of the bad timing of its released. With it coming out straight after 'ET'. Pretty much it was suicide. But gradually over the years this has deservedly become a cult favourite through video amongst horror and Sci-Fi fans. The film still holds up remarkably well today and surely was unfairly dismissed when it came out. Also the poster artwork for the film is one of the best I've seen. Carpenter was on a great trot at the time and definitely was at his pinnacle, with such films like 'Escape from New York', 'The Fog', 'Halloween' and 'Assault on Precinct 13' coming before it.'The Thing' is a experimental remake of Howard Hawk's 'The Thing from another World', but instead Carpenter was far more faithful to John W. Campbell's story "Who goes there", by getting the alien to conceal itself inside it's victim and never seeing the being in its natural form. Compared with the walking vegetable that had a striking resemblance to Frankenstein in Hawk's version. It's hard not to compare the two, with each one having a stronger point over the other, but for me I have to go with the '82' version. Anyhow, I just gotta say I love the burning imprint of the film's title in the opening. That scene alone sends chills down my spine and tells you what's to come.The story is far from groundbreaking, but the same can't be said about Rob Bottin's daring make-up effects, which simply are astoundingly revolting. Even today they still hold a huge amount of impact in creating a horrific vibe. Really, these grotesque monster effects are incredibly menacing and freaky, but heck these creations are ugly. The gore is worked in rather nicely, with enough blood splatter involved. Like I said the story isn't something out of the ordinary, but the paranoia part of it is beautifully constructed. This is helped by a well diverse group of moody characters that start losing it slowly and Carpenter turns up the notch by seemingly tightening the confines, where the feel of isolation and tension is sustained to the very end. I thought the ambiguity of the conclusion was fitting enough to the overall context. Claustrophobic brilliance on Carpenter's part. Even the story can be class a metaphor about trust and how it's not so easy to come by now. Carpenter creates a very sombre and downbeat atmosphere that goes very well with the cold conditions of the setting. Underneath it all it has an apocalyptic awe about it, where it looks like there's nothing anybody can do about this concealed being. What complements the chilling feel of dread is Ennio Morricone's throbbing score that's simply sublime in awe. The score packs a real unsteadiness and showers the flick with such vigorousness. Pretty much it does alienate you to what's happening on screen.The performances are reasonably solid, though nothing really to write home about. Kurt Russell is perfect as the lead figure and his charismatic presence proves it. The rest are nothing more than pawns in this game of control. They do seem a little bit more one-dimensional, but still they give such raw performances that add more to the realism factor. Also the chemistry between the men is quite believable. Although, one thing that kept on bugging me, was why they would go off alone when that creature is on the loose. Although that helped on the red herrings and crackling suspense. Where the film stumbles a bit, can be found on the script. The characters were more full and dialogue less stilted, in Howard's film. That's were I thought "The Thing from another World" really had the wood over "The Thing". It built more on the characters. But saying that there was enough suspense built up and sardonic wit in the dialog here. The heated dialog did really warmed up proceedings. The production design is perfect in every inch. From the assured cinematography with many neat angle shots to the creepy, but authentic looking station and its dark and freezing corridors. Another thing to touch a nerve were the echoing sound effects, with the gusty wind making a big impression and the eerie howling from the thing just makes your hairs stand up. Carpenter's ace direction manages to mix gruesome images with psychological elements to achieve an sensational viewing that makes you grab hold of anyone/anything tightly and leaves you with some memorable sequences fresh in mind.A definite Horror / Sci-Fi milestone. Sure it isn't flawless, but it's crafted with a passion to shock, but also compel. Although it's the innovative effects, which will make sure that it's remembered for many years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>- A helicopter chases a husky across the frozen landscape of Antarctica. The two Norwegians chasing the dog seem intent on killing it. The dog makes a bee-line for the American science station in what appears to be an attempt to seek safety. But is that really the dog's purpose? The Americans discover the dog's true mission only after it's too late.- I'm almost embarrassed to admit that I hadn't seen The Thing since its initial theatrical run. Because so much of the movie had slowly slipped from my memory, I have never placed it on a "favorites" list (until now). In fact, I had forgotten more of the movie than I remembered. I can promise that I won't wait another 23 years for my third viewing. The Thing is a no-holds-barred journey though some of the best that sci-fi, horror, and action have to offer. The movie never lets up and rarely gives the viewer a chance to catch a breath.- If you haven't seen this movie in a while (as I hadn't), the special effects will surely have stuck with you. They're gross, disturbing, and an excellent argument against the overuse of CGI in horror movies. Rob Bottin should have won an Academy Award for his special effects work on The Thing.- But it takes more than effects and gore to make a "good" movie. It's the interaction between the characters and their real feelings of mistrust that elevates The Thing to the lofty status it has achieved. These are men who have worked together in extremely close quarters with little outside contact. Trust is important in this kind of atmosphere. But when it becomes clear that there may be a problem with various members of the group, they're quick to turn on one another to save their own necks. The paranoia is fascinating to watch.- As far as I'm concerned, The Thing's ending is perfect. Too many movies attempt to spoon-feed viewers the answer to every question raised in the movie. The Thing leaves you with as many questions as it does answers. Good call, Carpenter! - I only have one minor quibble with the movie and it's based as much on my recent viewing of The Thing from Another World as anything. Try as I might, I can't help compare the two movies. I would have really appreciated a better opportunity in The Thing to get to know who these men are. The characters can be described as paper thin. The 1951 movie was more character driven, and as a result, I cared more for the characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterful horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie opens to a frozen wasteland of Antarctica, as we spot the lonely figure of a dog fleeing from its pursuers. It's a bleak, unforgiving setting and a perfect opener to this movie. The Thing, based on John W. Campbell Jr.'s novella Who Goes There? is one of the finest horror movies ever made. In a way it reminds me a lot of Alien, another masterpiece of horror. They both have an isolated setting where no help will be forthcoming, they both feature an attack by an unknown alien entity and they both have unbelievably good special effects, the sheer brutality, goriness and impossibility of which are the stuff of nightmares.The Thing adds the fact that its alien is capable of assuming other shapes, and the movie evolves to a tense hide and seek game and as the pressure rises, the group of scientists and researchers starts to crack. It's an intense experience with long scenes of unbearable atmosphere followed by short bursts of soul-chilling terror facilitated by the special effects of one Rob Bottin, a master of his craft.It's a well-told story, ending on a perfect note that isn't too uplifting, but neither is it a complete downer. Easily one of the best endings to a horror film I've ever seen and the rest of the story is told equally as well. Perhaps my only nitpick is that some of the characters and their actors aren't as strong as, say, in the Alien. There's perhaps one or two too many for all of them to get enough screen time to really shine. On the other hand, some are really good, like Kurt Russell's MacReady or Wilford Brimley's Dr. Blair.This is a movie that every fan of horror owes to himself or herself to see at least once. Its special effects are so scary that I actually wouldn't recommend this to anyone who's prone to nightmares. They're not nice to look at, they're not pleasant and under no circumstances should any child ever see this film. It's that frightening, that good at what it does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a pleasure to review this movie as I have seen it so many times. Even more so, since recently I showed it to my 21 year old friend for the first time. Had you been there for the amount of "NOOOO", (Gasps), "WHAT" &amp; "OH MY GOD" reactions, all of which left me in tears. It proves that John Carpenter's gross out remake of this 1950's Sci-Fi classic, continues to work its magic even today.Based on the short story "Who Goes There?" by John W. Campbell. A group of researchers in Antarctica, stumble across an alien life form at an abandoned post. You never fully see it, and it can assimilate its host whilst picking them off one by one. From there on tension rises, and trusts are tested. Leading to some of the most jaw dropping, gruesome creature effects ever committed to cinema.Watching this recently in the Blu-ray format, just shows how timeless this movie really is. Kurt Russell brings us an incredibly likable anti-hero, whose most prominent scene stealing moment is the legendary "Blood Test" scene. All this with Rob Bottin's spectacular creature effects, and Ennio Morricone's tense heart beating soundtrack paints "Antarctica" as if it was another planet (Actually frozen sound stages in Los Angeles, and British Columbia).Final Verdict: "Halloween" (1978) is a classic, but "The Thing" is John Carpenter's masterpiece. It continues to remain superior, regardless of any recent sequel-prequel homages. 9/10. Brilliant Sci-fi Horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Love John Carpenter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thing (1982), is directed by John Carpenter and stars Kurt Russell, as the leader of a crew stuck in Antarctica in the first week of winter because an alien has made its way into their base, kills anything it touches, and can only be destroyed by fire. It's based on the John W.Campbell short story "Who Goes There?" The film is awesome.The Thing is an extremely claustrophobic, tense and frightening story, with fantastic acting, perfect direction and brilliant animatronic/models, that made the cast feel sick to their stomachs when they first saw them, and I don't blame them, they are extremely realistic, detailed and scary. They are used in the best way possible.As said earlier, the acting is brilliant. The casting of Kurt Russell as R.J "Mac" MacReady is perfect, he is great as a brave but cautious leader that wants to see as little of his crew killed as possible. Keith David is also great as Childs, an extremely angry guy that hates the situation that they are in, and is kinda dislikeable as a character for a lot of the film, which really works to the film's advantage, giving it an element of distrust to go along with the tension.The direction and cinematography is amazing. The Thing is a beautiful looking film, with amazing set design and perfect lighting. The direction of the scenes is great. In some of the more tense scenes, for example where they are testing blood to see who is a thing and who isn't, is my favourite scene in the entire film, John Carpenter knows just how long to keep a shot going and keep the audience waiting, this winds up the tension perfectly, to an extremely frightening climax to the scene which is shot perfectly. A great thing that John Carpenter did, was to chill the set whilst the scenes were being shot, so it felt like the film was actually being filmed in Antarctica, this also gives the film a very chilling feel, which, in my opinion, just heightens the tension and really improves the film, it also helps you feel like the actors are actually in Antarctica. In interviews of both the actors and John Carpenter, it has been said that the actors AND the director did not know who was the thing and who wasn't in all of the dialogue scenes, which means that when you are watching it you know just as much as the actors, which really helps with bringing an element of distrust to the film.Overall, The Thing is the perfect science-fiction/horror film, along with Alien. 10/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterwork of horror atmosphere and special effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No horror movie brings you quite the icy, venereal chill of John Carpenter's The Thing. It's an undisputed horror classic that has lived on since it's slightly anticlimactic, ill received release back in the 80's (people didn't know a good fright flick when they saw it back then, I guess). Nevertheless, it's a heart stopping odyssey of ambient antarctic unease, sickening, squirm inducing practical effects, and a veil of impending danger and paranoia that blankets both the characters and the viewer, like the thick drifts of snow that blanket the screen to gorgeous effect. The story by now is timeless: a team of antarctic researchers in a remote location come across a gigantic spacecraft buried in the tundra, and unearth a grotesque, frozen creature that upon being thawed, wreaks havoc on them and their facility. It's an imitator, this monster, and can hide in plain sight, within the flesh and blood of any one of their crew. This gives way to extreme distrust, mental unraveling and mutiny as it turns them against one another. For me there's nothing quite as iconic as the opening: Ennio Morricone's ominous, rhythmical score kicks in as we see two hysterical Norwegians in a helicopter, Chasing a dog across the frozen terrain. It's one of the most dazzling, evocative entrances to a fright flick ever filmed. Kurt Russell, in his whiskered, macho glory plays Macready, the head of the team. Russell is always solid, especially in genre stuff, and he's almost as distinct and iconic here as his Snake Plissken character. T.K. Carter, Donald Moffat, Keith David Wilford Brimley and more round out the rest of the team, and I won't mention standouts because they're all just fantastic and each play their part to a T. A huge highlight is the gruesome creature effects. When the it tries to imitate something and messes up, the result is a grossly misshapen slab of slimy nondescript gore, guaranteed to freak and gross you out in equal measures. I won't spoil anything with specifics, but the dog kennel and defibrillator scenes are time capsule worthy and should be shown in special effects makeup schools as a shining example. Carpenter pulls off the second absolutely flawless horror movie of his career with this one, not an easy feat, especially in this genre. All the parts fit together perfectly, resulting in as chilling sci fi horror for the ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Clear!" I've loved this great classic for just about forever, it's just so endlessly gripping and so much fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I even start, if you haven't seen this movie, *go* see this movie! If you enjoy tension and horror in the slightest go and see it, 'cause you will probably love it. It's one of those very special and fearsomely distinctive kinds of horror movies from yesteryear that has the rare enduring charm and quality about it that just more than stands the test of time. I suppose it's a simple and straightforward enough tale of fear, distrust, and most importantly twisted alien abominations, and how they slowly but surely invade and infect the desperate souls who are trapped in a place where none of them can hope to escape or even call for help, which of course just raises the despair and unease to new levels. This group of essentially doomed men must try and prevent the end of the world, provided they can figure out who to trust and who is still human before it's too late... Damn if it isn't so near-perfectly made, everything about it is handled so well and works out so beautifully. The starkly freezing visuals and cinematography is suffused with fear and unseen menace, with the early point in the film where they visit the grim charred remains of the Norwegian camp being especially nightmarish and creepy because unbeknownst to them, that's what's lying ahead. It just draws you right in and makes you almost feel like your in their shoes, and that's one of the things that I think a worthwhile horror picture is meant to do, it immerses you in the environment of what you're watching. I like how the cast are all interesting guys who are different from one another, and while they're not super-developed or anything you definitely care about them enough that you fully share their horror at what's befalling them. I really like the performance of the dog in the opening act which isn't all that it seems, you get a very sinister vibe from it, it doesn't look like your average plain old happy dumb dog, it looks like it's thinking and waiting for something. Way to go dog.. Never looks at the camera once! I don't believe that you can truly love this film without enjoying all the aspects of it, some love it for all the psychological atmosphere, whereas myself I lean more towards the monsterfest splatter side of things(!). But the creature appearances and the mood play off each other, every build-up is paid off, and when the Thing does explode out of nowhere when you're least expecting it, it's really the cherry on the top. I'd put my money on it as the scariest monster ever, I mean what's more alarming than the terror of your own body and mind being stolen and corrupted from within and turned against you? The horrific concept of the parasite taking over is truly used to its fullest potential. As a creature, I see the overall entity of the Thing as a giant all-consuming mouth, with each separate organism a tooth, and all that they can really do is to see how long they can, stem the jaw... The complete carnage of the monster attacks is violent and revolting, but also so undeniably fascinating that you just can't look away, it's like madness given form... My favourite is the sideways snappy-head because the legendary build up to it with the blood test is so perfectly nail-biting to me every time. The moment is so hectic that it's almost absurdly comedic, the way poor frightened Windows has his head thoroughly chewed on before being spat out! It's a picture that really shows what could be done with the technique of practical effects. I could not believe that nobody ever won any awards for those effects, or that this excellent film was so unfairly torn apart by the critics at the time of its release. That was grossly unfair and messed up, but...it does seem indeed that all good 'Things' really do come to those who wait, and over the years it has got every last bit of acclaim and recognition that it always deserved. John Carpenter may not have technically created the idea of the Thing, but it's because of this movie and his awesome vision why people recognise it to this day, it was him that breathed life into it and gave it an enduring(many!) face and identity. My god this movie is brilliant, no other adaptation holds a candle it it, it gave the original story the presentation it deserved. Thrilling, perfectly-casted and excellently written, I can honestly recommend this to anyone that loves gruesome horror or edge-of-your-seat mystery and suspense. This movie is gold, savour it on a long cold night...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is an update of the classic 'The Thing From Outer Space', but only like it's predecessor, this film is in full color, and the characters of this film have much more to worry about than an alien veggieThe film centers around a group of Arctic Researchers you encounter an alien lifeform capable of taking the form of anything it comes into contact with, and out of for that matter. Kurt Russell stars as R.J. MacReady, an alcoholic Vietnam Vet, thrust into the role of leader of a group of relatively cold and callous men all of whom are readily plunging into manic paranoia and somewhat madness once they realize that they are up against a creature that can take any form, be any one of them.John Carpenter, more than in any other of his films, manages to create a truly believable and incredible atmosphere. When watching this film you truly get the sense of the dark,sinister, desolate surroundings, you feel and realize that these characters have no where to go...never for one second do you not believe they are stuck on a polar ice cap. Also, this film has perhaps one of the greatest endings to any film of it's genre, or any genre for that matter. I'm not going to give it away here, but to say that it will leave you wondering would be an understatement.Kurt Russell is superb as MacReady....truly conveying the emotions of a man thrust into a situation of unimaginable horror, forced to lead a group of men who cannot trust that the man next to them is not the creature that has driven them to the brink of paranoia and emotional meltdown.I don't care if this movie is 20 years old by now, the special effects in this movie are gut wrenching, mind blowing, and absolutely awesome. They blow away any CGI pixel based crap out there today. The 'Thing' itself is a truly horrifying and disturbing creation...unlike any alien you have ever seen in a movie before. Those who have a low tolerance for gore and blood had best prepare themselves for watching this movie.This movie does what any good horror/sci fi movie should do, it really thrusts you into it's character's world. It leaves you wondering, what would you do, who could you trust if anyone you knew could be the creature waiting to feed on you, and take you over as well. The images, and ideals of this movie stayed with me long after i first saw it, and today as i write this review send a chill up my spine.It is a true shame this movie is only now getting the proper recognition it deserves. A box office flop when released, now more then ever when movies are paper thin with plot, and one dimensional in effects, this film can be appreciated as a true masterpiece of sci/fi and horror.If possible, get the Collector's Edition DVD, and enjoy it in anamorphic widescreen..the way it is truly meant to be seen. Marvel at the incredible scenery, the taught direction, the excellent atmosphere, the sweat inducing, gag reflex activating, and everything else that makes this movie great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very surprised by what this film achieved. I went in with low expectations even though it had a spot on IMDb's 250; man was I wrong.From the start of the film we are immediately asking questions for which we want answers. Is that helicopter crew shooting at the dog? What are they afraid of? Why did they attempt to destroy the American base in Antarctica? When these questions are answered, we ask the more important question: which of these men have been infected by the titular "thing?"Such a simple premise, yet so powerful to get our hearts racing and question humanity. Blair may seem mad, but he is very rational trying to destroy transportation so the thing cannot reach the world outside of Antarctica. What I love is that saving humanity is an implied motivation for various characters within the film, but it is hardly stated by any of the characters.This movie is a thrill ride, science fiction film with a concept not unlike "And Then There Were None." One thing bothered me in this film: remember how I said Blair is rational? This is due to a lazy bit of writing, in which a computer states before the camera that humanity could be wiped out in a short amount of time due to this thing, and this is based on a few seconds of analysis by the computer. I just found it cheesy.The conclusion of the film had me in awe, questioning humanity while the two survivors simply wait for a sign that either of them are a double until they ultimately perish.</fullReview>

Legendary director John Carpenter uses every part of his immense talent to produce a true classic that just seems to get better with age. The camera glides from scene to scene &amp; creates a magnificent atmosphere filled with paranoia &amp; dread. The make up effects are a true delight created by Rob Bottin who produces some of the best effects you are ever likely see on film. On initial release The Thing was a box office failure mainly due to E.T being released at the same time which took over everything in its path. However the movie has picked up a massive cult following over the years &amp; is rightly regarded as a true horror classic today. A brilliant piece of cinema from a true master director....They don't make movies like this anymore,sublime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can you say about a classic like "THE THING" that hasn't been said? The remake was just awful. This Carpenter movie from 1982 itself is a remake of an earlier film from 1951 called "The Thing from another World". That movie was pretty good too. Hands down though, the Carpenter version is just as good as it gets for monster movies. i rank this up there with the original "ALIEN" by Ridley Scott. Kurt Russel is iconic as RJ MacReady in the performance of his career. The snowy plains and landscape and the claustrophobic interiors of the Antarctica station are very effective, not to mention the eerie soundtrack. This movie has it all, laughs and scary as hell. If you're thinking about seeing the remake, you may just want to re-watch the Carpenter version again or even re-watch the original version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anybody who knows anything about horror director John Carpenter knows how much he idolizes not only Howard Hawks but also the 1951 sci-fi chiller "The Thing from Another World" about an alien that tangles with a group of scientists who accidentally thaw out the creature out. Unlike the Hawks produced original, Carpenter and writer Bill Lancaster went back to the premise of John W. Campbell, Jr.,'s novella "Who Goes There?" (1938) where the creature impersonates various member of the colony while they struggle to destroy it. No, this horror movie is not for the squeamish. The eponymous monster is a slimy, creepy, critter that imitates the physical characteristics of anybody that it consumes. "The Thing" is the best film that John Carpenter ever directed and probably his most expensive. Rob Boktin's creatures are hair-raising, and the scene when the guy gets his arms bitten off at the elbow while he is administers CPR to a dying man is terrific. This tense, humorless, all-male yarn takes place in Antartica in 1982 and opens with a Norwegian chopper pursuing a Husky across the snow-swept terrain. The dog manages to reach another community of scientist before they can kill it and the Americans kill the insane, trigger-happy Norwegian. In other words, the dog survives and is taken in. Before long things start to happen. Kurt Russell stars a MacReedy, a rough and tough helicopter pilot who nurses Jack Daniels throughout the movie and wears a hilarious Yosemite Sam Stetson. Not to be missed. Lots of suspenseful situations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The skeleton crew of an Antarctic base are terrorised by an unearthed alien life-form!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very few horror films remain locked under cult favourite status while at the same time being hailed by critics and widespread audiences as possibly the greatest horror film of all time.While it has been pointed out by movie legends such as George Romero and Stephen King that people love being scared by a good horror movie, it is not specifically the case with majority audiences. Films such as The Exorcist, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween may be classed as the best of all time, they have also proved too much for the mainstream, who like their horror slightly more psychological, less physical and most often promising a happy ending.This may explain why master filmmaker John Carpenter's 1982 powerhouse science-fiction horror 'The Thing' did so poorly at the cinema box office, besides the unfortunate fact that the darling of Hollywood, Steven Spielberg, had released E.T: The Extra Terrestrial at the same time.The film is cold, dark, uncompromising, you can cut the paranoid and petrified atmosphere with a knife, but you'd do better to incinerate it with a flamethrower just to feel that little bit safer before you go to bed. There are no warm and endearing characters to care for, every moment this mysterious but absurdly terrifying Thing from another world strikes, you are left with goosebumps, your imagination running scared and out of control and in the end... have you made up your mind how the end will come? An American Scientific Research base isolated in the Antarctic finds itself witness to an incident where the members of a not too distant Norwegian base have seemingly gone mad. The Norwegians are killed in regrettable circumstances. leaving no answers as to their actions leaving chronically drunk and depressed helicopter pilot MacReady with no choice but to fly a couple of the concerned scientists over to the Norwegian base where they discover a horrific aftermath of grisly death and destruction. The remains of a mutated and seemingly inhuman corpse is found within the cinders of a burned out bonfire and very quickly the tone is set and the scientists' reality turned upside down.Aliens are amongst us! Very quickly, shock and disgust turn to fear, fear gives birth to anger and paranoia sets in deep as the remaining life-form next targets the American base and secretly multiplies within their ranks in the hopes of outnumbering the remaining humans before it is discovered and destroyed.Hopes of containing the alien life-form, before it is discovered that it is not only an intelligent life-form but also a very contagious one, fade very quickly as the whiskey and sleep deprived R.J. MacReady - played with literal ice cold awesomeness by the one and only Kurt Russell - and the few men he feels he can trust begin to fall apart under the strain of fear and isolation, setting themselves apart from those they feel will only lessen their chances of survival.As time grows short and the numbers die off, it becomes clear that nobody can be trusted and the only way of stopping this nightmare is by effectively ending their very own chances of survival.Carpenter writes possibly his best ever script, the scenes setting the way for a nightmarish Cold War paranoia tale where the fate of the world could very well be put at risk by the fears of a handful of men. There is nowhere to run and hide. Outside, Antarctic Winter is setting in and deadly sub-zero temperatures make it impossible to escape. Where safety in numbers ought to make a man feel safe, the danger is multiplied and to sit alone in the dark is practically suicide. The dog pound is a slaughterhouse, the medical bay is contaminated, people are losing their minds and cabin fever is setting in and the Thing never sleeps...An eerie theme by musical genius Ennio Morricone sets the tone; dark, depressed, suspenseful and doom-inspired. Master of animatronic special-effects Rick Bottin provides the most ghastly practical horrors ever devoted to film and a craftily untypical and notably mature ensemble cast (Kurt Russell, Keith David, Donald Moffat, Thomas G. Waites and Wilford Brimley) provide a sense of reality that no kid that wants to make yet another slasher/zombie flick could ever hope to.If you haven't seen this film before and for some reason you have an intolerance to anything outside of CGI, pop music soundtracks, laugh a minute characters and damsels in distress in any shape or form then I dare you to see what a real horror film is and watch this. Call it an education because there is not a director out there who will ever rival John Carpenter or make a film as cold and creepy as The Thing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remains to be one of my favorite horrors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have probably added +1 to my rating of this movie due to nostalgic reasons. I watched this movie when I was young and I loved it and remains to be one of my favorite horror movies. However, this is probably more an indictment on the horror genre in general, as it seems that not many great horror movies are made now-a-days.I love the setting and atmosphere of the movie as well as the storyline. Stuck in Antartica on a base with a handful of men and a deadly morphing alien that takes over your body which was dug out of the ice.Considering the age of the movie, the effects are OK. I can get past them...even the "spider head", which was quite horrifying to a 10 year old boy.Another thing I like about this movie was the absence of any pointless love affair. In fact the movie lacked females altogether, which seems to be quite rare in today's movies. In all honesty, I felt this added to the atmosphere of the movie.There are a few minor dumb dialog and plot decisions, but does not detract from the movie for me. One thing I found a little silly, was the ending with the alien managing to almost build a spaceship out of spare parts. Ummm.... A little illogical and far fetched, but I will forgive it.Overall if you like a good horror and have overlooked John Carpenter's The Thing, then it is very much worth your while to give it a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cult horror classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not so often I encounter the chance to revisit a classic on the big screen yet yesterday I had that privilege to watch John Carpenter's cult horror classic 'The Thing' at the Cineworld Cinema near Piccadilly Circus. The film begins in the midst of the Antarctic snowfield where a helicopter is circling an American research base chasing down a husky with a sniper. When the helicopter crashes and the pilot is killed, the passenger survives only to continue his mission of pursuing and killing the dog and in the process shots one of the members of the research team to get to the dog. The gunman who appears to be Norwegian is shot down by the captain of the base as he obviously appears to be steered crazy and incredibly dangerous.When they eventually find out that this dog isn't what it appears to be, two members of the team, one being MacReady (played by Kurt Russel who gives a fine performance here), goes on a search for the Norwegian base to see what clues they can find. When they do find the abandoned base, they find a large block of ice which looks as if something had been frozen in it for centuries and a half burnt corps that looks like something they've never seen. Of course this corps is brought back to the base, and after a few autopsies are made, one of the doctors makes the shocking discovery of a creature that imitates cells When one of the members of the base is left alone with the remains of the creature, another team member enters the room only to discover the creature is not dead and is now in fact imitating a member of the team. When help comes forth, the creature has almost finished the process and looks exactly like the team member except for a few last features. This is where the tension really begins; paranoia hits everyone and hits them hard. Did they kill the creature? Are there any remains of the creature left? If so, has it taken shape of any other team members? Who is human and who is the creature? Who can they trust? You can even feel the tension in the atmosphere of the base, the silence, the darkness, and the reactions of the team members when they suspect another team member.If one person gets out of their sight for an instant then that person is automatically a suspect. The best example of paranoia is shown by Dr. Blair played by Wilford Brimley who delivers the best performance in the film. He discovers that if this creature reaches civilization, it will eventually imitate mankind little by little and this drives him over the edge and wants no one from the base to escape for the sake of mankind. I felt quite fortunate as to have previously visited Howard Hawk's original Sci-Fi classic 'The Thing from Another World' which is quite an impressive film especially for 1951, did not feature a shape-shifting creature, instead it featured a gigantic creature that required human blood in order to reproduce. The director John Carpenter, being a fan of Howard Hawks did not try to copy the original; instead he went back to the original novel 'Who Goes There?' by John W. Campbell Jr. from 1939 which did feature a shape-shifting creature, thus making the film more tense and more suspenseful.John Carpenter has never been known for his character build up; in fact the villains in his movies are usually mindless and lack emotion or personality as shown in this film and many others such as Michael Myers in his merciless masterpiece 'Halloween', the car Christine in 'Christine' or the zombie-like ghosts from 'The Fog'. But he is famous for his tense scenes and his dark and creepy shots as hardly any of his movies contain more than ten minutes of daylight. This is a well paced, well shot film and with these sorts of movies, that's rare.Watching 'The Thing' again I couldn't help but be reminded of Don Siegel's Sci-Fi classic 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' from 1956, where a doctor in a small town practise finds numerous patients of his claiming that their relatives or close friends are not who they seem to be but in fact impostors who look exactly them. These two films feature the same sort of paranoia, only John Carpenter makes the decision of showing the shape-shifting commence by using extremely grotesque and gory special effects. Although I am not a fan of grotesque special effects, especially as over blown as they are here, John Carpenter's version of 'The Thing' still succeeds as a haunting tale of paranoia and is a highly entertaining and action packed sci-fi film that is sure to entertain even if it's not as great as Don Siegel's classic.Upon the film's release back in 1982, the film did not do so well in the box office, maybe because it came out only two weeks after the phenomenon 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' or maybe it's simply due to its extensive use gore and violence which it earned it an "R" rating by the Motion Picture Association of America. It instead went on to become a cult favourite and is now considered to be one of the best and scariest horror films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Don't Know Who To Trust</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The peace of a US scientific outpost in Antarctica is suddenly shattered when a dog runs into camp being shot at by some crazed Norwegians. That night, bewilderment turns to terror when the dog abruptly mutates into a howling tentacled beast ?John Carpenter's remake of The Thing is one of the best science-fiction/horror movies ever made. It's better than the original, much more faithful to the short story it comes from, is extremely well played by a fine ensemble of character actors, features incredibly inventive and horrifying makeup effects, and is an utterly riveting suspense yarn about distrust and paranoia taken to the ultimate level. Scary stories tend to break down into two distinct types; the externalised campfire story, where the monster is out there (Jaws, Frankenstein) trying to get at us, and the internalised Edgar Allan Poe confession, where the monster is within us (Psycho, The Exorcist) and trying to break free. This movie is a perfect example of the latter. The Thing is both a slimy alien creature waiting to eat us but also a metaphor for pretty much anything you like (cancer / xenophobia / nature gone mad). The first half maps the scientists' discovery of what's happening, and the second pulls all the tension out of the situation as they snap, bicker, point accusatory fingers and fail to follow through on half-hearted plans of action. The 1951 movie is a model of men behaving with calm organisation in a desperate situation. This film is much braver, as it depicts a little society splintering into pieces and self-combusting; rarely does a film revel so much in tragic misanthropy. Carpenter's films deal again and again with isolation as a main theme, both celebrating the individuality of the lone hero but mostly reinforcing the grim reality that we are all ultimately alone. On a technical level it is a stunning film; the base and its snowy exteriors are brilliantly realised by designer John Lloyd, and Dean Cundey's fluid, unhurried photography is dazzlingly beautiful, all frozen blues and fiery oranges. The eye-popping effects by twenty-two-year-old Rob Bottin are nothing short of astounding, as dogs mutate into nightmarish beasts, a man's stomach turns into a gaping maw, a disembodied head grows spider legs, and flesh and blood dissolve into plant-like monstrosities. These elements, combined with a creepy low-key Ennio Morricone score, create a tremendous realism to what would otherwise be a totally insane story, and the end result is a powerful, disturbing, terrifying film. On its release, this movie had many critics, most of whom could not see anything beyond the special effects. Some who did also argued that the story is confusing and badly plotted - when and how do Blair and Palmer get infected, what happens to Fuchs and Nauls, does Norris even realise he's been taken over, who framed MacReady with the shredded clothes, and always, why don't we find out what happens in the end ? This for me is perhaps the best aspect of the movie - the answer to any of these questions is we don't know, and that's the entire point. The movie is about not knowing what's going on, not knowing who you can trust, not even knowing if you're human or not; that's what real fear is, and few movies show it, but this one does. Watch it, and figure it out for yourself. Based on a great 1938 novella, Who Goes There ?, by John W. Campbell Jr. Trivia - the dog/Thing in this movie was played by a malamute/wolf half-breed called Jed, and for my money he gives the best animal performance in all cinema; a lot of Oscar-winning stars could learn from him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monster movie in which an alien menaces an isolated scientific community</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nice and estimable action/thriller well directed by John Carpenter who provides a punchy suspenseful Sci-Fi . It deals with a lonely group (Charles Hallahan , Donald Moffat , Wilford Brimley ,Richard Dysart , Richard Masur, T.K. Carter, David Clennon) of scientists who discover weird events , as when the research bunch are menaced by a shape-changing . Antarctica: an extraordinary continent of awesome beauty. It is also home to an isolated outpost where a discovery full of scientific possibility becomes a mission of survival when an alien from outer space is unearthed by a crew of international scientists. The shape-shifting creature, accidentally unleashed at this marooned colony, has the ability to turn itself into a perfect replica of any living being. It can look just like you or me, but inside, it remains inhuman. In the thriller The Thing, paranoia spreads like an epidemic among a group of researchers as they're infected, one by one, by a mystery from another planet. But it is about to wake up. When an alien frees from its frozen prison, the protagonist ( Kurt Russell ) must avoid it from killing them off one at a time. And in this vast, intense land, a parasite that can mimic anything it touches will pit human against human as it tries to survive and flourish.One of the great Sci-Fi classics , the gradual built-up suspense is quite superb as when the monster is shown largely to create a real menace , though some moments looks and feels just like a remake of Alien. This exciting film packs chills , thrills , guessing , paranoia , absence of all characterisation ,spectacular FX , including a loathing chest-burning scene . It takes a liberal stand in exposing the tension of men when confronted with an alien . Based on the novel by John Campbell , the screen-writer Bill Lancaster rejects out the hand the idea that the alien might be worth attempting to understand or communicate with research team . Thrilling and intriguing musical score by the maestro Ennio Morricone . Colorful and appropriate cinematography by Dean Cundey . The thing produced by Larry Franco emerges as distinctly Carpenter movie and one might be recommending for its FX , masterfully made by Rob Bottin . B-Film or not , though it's still a masterpiece . The earlier first version results to be The Thing from another world by Christian Nyby and Howard Hawks with Kenneth Tobey , Margaret Sheridan and James Arness as the monster ; it holds a subtle but efficient intrigue . The modern version is The Thing (2011) by Mattijs Heijmingen with Eic Olsen , Ulrich Thomsen , it serves as a prelude to John Carpenter's classic 1982 film of the same name in which a Paleontologist Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) has traveled to the desolate region for the expedition of her lifetime. Joining a Norwegian scientific team that has stumbled across an extraterrestrial ship buried in the ice, she discovers an organism that seems to have died in the crash eons ago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's been a while since I've typed this line in a review: an old horror movie without cheese.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me get this out of the way: I am not a biased fan of this movie. I did not grow up with it, I did not see it once, get scared, and then love it when I was older, and I did not watch it with any hype or weighted opinion whatsoever. I'm not really a John Carpenter fan. I am a hardcore horror fan who has seen the majority of what the genre has to offer. I am an adult, and I watched this last night, 9/17/08. I'm not sure it's possible to find an opinion that is more unbiased than mine when I say: The Thing rocked.First and foremost, the reason The Thing works is because it does not bash your over the head with a block of cheese, unlike most "classic" horror movies. Some of the effects are a bit outdated, despite what the lifetime fans would have you believe, but not so much as to look cheesy. At all. There is very little gore?nothing that the average parent wouldn't let a 8-year-old see?and the gore effects are also outdated, but it doesn't take away from the movie. I just found it downright refreshing to watch a movie that didn't try to kick me in the balls. I've watched so many ultra-gory movies lately, The Thing made me remember what it was like when movies didn't use gore to make the viewer feel like crap, but instead used gore as part of the actual story. It's the perfect movie to watch on a snowy night with your girlfriend/wife or your kids.The reason The Thing isn't cheesy is because it submerges you in atmosphere and suspense and mystery, then it punches you. The creatures are not generic whatsoever, and some of them are downright weirdly awesome. (Spider-head, anyone?) The plot is pretty generic, if you can even call it a plot at all. Here is one of the greatest movies of all time, and it does something that you wouldn't expect: it doesn't really have a plot. No, The Thing is true survival horror. There is nothing here except the desire to survive, and that is the only plot. The opening scene hints that the creatures are aliens, but, really, the movie never says much about their origins other than that. Watching this movie is almost like watching people in an arena try to survive?you don't watch it for the story. What makes The Thing original and different from the other movies like it is the small details, like setting, the creature designs, the characters, the ending, and so on.People who get bored with this movie don't understand suspense. I can understand that, because in the generation that we live in, suspense is dead and buried. Suspense has been replaced with either (1) lame action, or (2) lame dialogue scenes that "build characters", even though the characters are pure clichs. Suspense is the feeling of "I know everyone is going to die . . ." that you get before anything happens. I can count the amount of movies that get suspense right on one hand, but The Thing honestly pulls it off. If you're a fan of suspense movies?and no, I don't mean Wolf Creek, I mean like Alien?I do not know why you haven't seen this movie already.Then there is one more thing I need to mention: The Thing isn't Alien. It never will be Alien. It is not quite as good as Alien, though it has more action. It is, however, the only movie I would ever mention in the same breath as Alien, because it does come very, very close.Overall: This is by far the best Carpenter movie I've seen, and one of the few movies I've ever seen that understands suspense. It's easily one of the best horror movies of all time, and I'm saying that as someone who find most "classic" horror movies pure cheese. Watch this movie. Watch it now.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's the antarctic, it's an American research centre and it's f**king cold outside. However, when a rival Norwegian research team turn up shooting at a dog, it looks like they've gone stir crazy and are put down for their own good. However as time progresses it becomes extremely apparent that they were very much in possession of their faculties and were not only fighting for their survival but for the survival of the human race.This is the start of John Carpenter's masterpiece (Rather then Halloween) and the film is made memorable for two things, first the effects, that never cease to amaze and dazzle the viewer in their complex and unending ability to shock, terrify and bemuse. Let's get something right that Spielberg recently had a bone with over the first three Indy films. matte paintings that look good are fine, CGI that looks like a play station game is not. The effects in this film are real, you know you're looking at something real and this makes for a film that is all the more unsettling.Next the acting and the script. In this film we feel the sweat and unpleasant camaraderie that people cooped up in this kind of environment feel. There are uneasy alliances and downright detestation of some people, they're not friends they're colleagues and it shares with Alien the distinction of putting these human relations in perfect transfer to the big screen. The script and acting make the effects real because you believe in how the people are with each other. Its ordinariness makes it real.For those of you who have not seen it watch past the first 30 minutes when you might think you're watching a kitchen sink drama in the Antarctic. Trust me, it's worth the wait.Nuff said Em</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter's masterpiece of paranoia!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately I spend much of my time berating John Carpenter in regards to his recent lazy and mediocre efforts. What a refreshing change it is to relive his earlier seminal work and remember just why he once had a reputation as one of America's most exciting and inventive film makers! 'The Thing' is quite possible the best movie Carpenter has ever made, and sadly it seems, ever will make. He is at the height of his powers with this dark, tense and claustrophobic thriller, and is blessed with a superb ensemble cast, and (a rarity for him these days) a decent script will believable, fully rounded characters. Kurt Russell gives his best work for Carpenter here, in arguably his strongest performance to date. The supporting cast is flawless, and includes fine character actors such as Wilford Brimley ('Cocoon'), Keith David ('Dead Presidents'), Richard Dysart ('Being There'), Richard Masur ('Who'll Stop The Rain)', and Donald Moffat ('The Right Stuff'). I highly recommend the DVD version of this movie which features one of the most entertaining and informative commentaries I've ever heard. (from Carpenter and Russell) Much maligned when it was first released, 'The Thing' now looks like a masterpiece of paranoid science fiction, one of the very few remakes that surpasses the original version, and absolutely essential viewing for any self respecting horror or SF fan. It really doesn't get much better than this! Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American researchers at an Antarctic outpost find themselves faced with a shape-shifting alien that can assume the form of any person or animal it absorbs. The rarest of the rare: a remake of a great film that is just as good, if not better, than the original. I don't know if I would say it's better but it's a damn fine film. I love both movies equally. It doesn't just copy the original. As a matter of fact, other than the bare bones of the plot, it's completely different. It adheres more closely to the short story that both Thing films were based on, which was more of a 'body snatchers' paranoia type of story.The Thing boasts one of the strongest casts of any movie made in the last forty years. There's not a weak link in the bunch. Kurt Russell's MacReady is one of his best roles. Wilford Brimley, Richard Dysart, Keith David, Richard Masur, and on down the line are great actors. Everybody gives their all. John Carpenter's direction is excellent. It's been said by many that it's his best work. It's really hard to argue with that. Surprisingly, he doesn't do the score for this one. Instead the great Ennio Morricone scores it but does so in a manner very similar to what Carpenter himself might have done. Rob Bottin's special effects are terrifically fun in the way only old school effects could be. I can't say enough good things about this movie. It's a classic. If you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about. If you haven't, what are you waiting for?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thing. Sounds scary, right! Yeah, it is scary, mysterious, thrilling sci-fi horror classic. The plot is one liner, scientists in the Antarctic are confronted by a shape-shifting alien that assumes the appearance of the people that it kills. The special effects are perfect and have not dated at all even after more than 30 years. It builds the tense atmosphere from the very start and helped by hell like stormy chilling weather of Antarctic and thunderous background score. All actor act well and Kurt Russell as lead does his job right. There is loads of blood bath and brutal killings by the scary thing. The open ending takes the movie out of ordinary and leaves you wondering why there is no sequel at all of this classic? Nevertheless, until they could think of worthy sequel, enjoy this timeless sci-fi horror classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cult favourite that has become a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A dog is chased through the wide open snowy expanse of the Antarctic by men in a helicopter who attempt to kill it with a rifle. They fail and die, and the dog enters an American compound unharmed. The men of this outpost now try to discover what events led to this bizarre scene?John Carpenter's remake of the 1950 Howard Hawks original The Thing From Another World is a definite example of a remake that exceeds the original. With this film Carpenter upgraded the original with excellent use of very impressive practical special effects. These effects still look extremely good today thirty years on. But it's not just this that has been improved; the characters and dialogue are better, while the sense of paranoid mystery is an entirely new addition to the story. Despite all these aspects, it comes as a surprise to a lot of people that The Thing was a box office failure upon release in 1982. Even the fools at the Razzies jumped on the bandwagon and nominated Ennio Morricone's Carpenteresque soundtrack for 'worst musical score' ? a frankly ludicrous decision. Anyway, it was only in the years that followed that The Thing built up a reputation as a cult favourite, to the point that it is now considered something of a classic. Which is the way it should be considering that this is a highly effective and claustrophobic sci-fi horror movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How could this have done badly?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the last several years remakes have been a big money maker. This is especially true of the Horror genre. Most genre buffs would say this trend must go, but the studios keep churning them out. It's not that remakes of classic films is a new thing, but until now few found much success. One of famed director John Carpenter's biggest influences is the late director Howard Hawks. You can find many homages and references to Hawk's work in many of Carpenter's films.Now apparently Hawks wasn't as involved with the original 'The Thing' as originally thought, but still his presence must show in it somewhere. Carpenter had success with nearly every film before this one and after Sci-Fi/Horror hits like 'Alien' you'd think people would have flocked to Carpenter's version of 'The Thing.' Instead the film performed poorly at the Box Office and wasn't exactly a hit with critics either. But over the years, like some of the director's other works, the film has gained a strong following. This was the first time I've seen the film in it's entirety and personally I just can't see what could have kept it from reaching success.Pros: Good work from the ensemble cast. Breathtaking cinematography and scenery. Startling and impressive effects. Perfect and claustrophobic setting. Some really creepy moments and images that you won't be able to shake. After a slow start, the paces moves along. An excellent and at times chilling score that was undeserved of it's Razzie nomination. As usual Carpenter does a great job of creating suspense and tension.Cons: Characters could have used some more developing. Anticlimactic ending.Final thoughts: Though perhaps not Carpenter's greatest achievement, this film is none the less a solid piece of scary entertainment. Few films of this kind today have the effect this one does. It's held up very well and is the kind of film you may not want to watch at night alone. A real skin crawler from one of the masters.My rating: 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gooey Remake As Scary As The Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's stylishly grotesque remake of this sci-fi horror classic is a hit on all levels. Carpenter's sense of claustrophobia, fear, and distrust resonate throughout the film. The "Thing" itself is one of the most bizarre and disturbing creatures ever caught on celluloid. Also, Kurt Russell, Keith David, and Wilford Brimley (yes, Wilford Brimley!) are all great and, at times, pretty damned scary. Finally, "You've got to be f***ing kidding me!" (One of the best lines in sci-fi history!).This has been a "Five Sentence Review".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie very much, even though I don't think its particularly original or frightening. The cast is interesting and after a slow start, it moves along pretty well. Kurt Russell and Keith David have a great moment at the end and the finale is jolting. I enjoyed John Carpenter's work with that kid with the knife, to be honest. But I understand this was his chance to deliver in a big studio movie, only to be out-done by "E.T". Talk about bad timing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An essential horror classic, equally cerebral and gory.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thing is one of the best horror movies, but it was a box office flop as the gore and bleak tone was too much for audiences at the time. The basic premise: an alien virus called The Thing infects people, assimilates their body and controls their mind. The Thing emulates the human in an uncanny way. It's up to the viewer to guess which of the people are innocent and which of the people have been turned into aliens.The first half-hour is slow by modern standards but it builds the setting well. The make-up artistry is superbly done to create terrifying moments. The tension between the characters and their mistrust of each other in this situation makes for some intense moments as the situation continually gets worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly frightening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this film a number of times now and It never get's old. Having grown up with the semi new era of movies. I haven't watched a whole lot of older movies that date as far back as The Thing. I consider this movie to be a contender for one of my favorite movies though! Strong cast, the effects are great for its time and it over all holds it's creepy atmosphere it set out to have. I would recommend this movie to any horror movie buff, that love the whole monster/alien theme. The Thing does it, and it does it well. I am pretty excited for the prequel coming out next weekend. I really hope it holds up to this masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thing Reviewed in 2011</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is the strangest thing I have ever seen! John Carpenter's sci-fi horror film about a mutant molecular cell that once it comes into contact of any living entity manifests itself, transforming and imitating the original DNA of that being. 'The Thing' as it becomes known is capable of assuming the physical and mental characteristics of anyone it chooses or to put it simply, an alien life form in disguise! Many top critics have missed the mark in their reviews of this film, although most being from when it originally came out. The public nonetheless knows a classic when they see one and that's why this film has developed such a long legacy and rightly so. The story is plausible if a little thin at times but the continuous 'guessing game' of who is infected keeps the viewer on edge, building up to a wonderfully tense moment in the film I like to call, 'the blood test'.This is the first time I have watched this film and what is great is that even by today's high standard of modern technology, the special effects are smashing and holds strong within today's market. The aliens are designed brilliantly, totally realistic (if that's possible with aliens?!) and gross out scary. I felt at times nauseated but that is the hallmark of this movie's intent. Everything from the opening credits to stage sets is very artistically designed so any remake of this remake would be very hard to beat in terms of creativity and visuals.Where the film slightly disappoints is emotionally, with little viewer-character sympathy. I didn't really feel any empathy towards any of the guys involved however I could definitely understand their feelings of paranoia in the 'who to trust' scenario. Also, as there are no females cast in the film, women viewers may find caring about the characters hard to come by. Having said this, the movie does achieve its main aim, which is to provide the horror and not character development. There is no bad acting only stereotypes which some people dislike but Kurt Russell as Mac does a fine job.When a solitary movie has an 'open' beginning and unclosed ending like this, the viewer is left with intrigue and wanting more which always is a good sign. Yet nowadays everybody wants to have trilogies and quadrilogies settling for quantity rather than quality. So it's not surprising that I have read there is a prequel &amp; sequel in the pipeline, with the latter being undertaken by John Carpenter. Sometimes trilogies can be good, wrapping everything up nicely, filling the hunger, and as the possible sequel will contain the same team- I'm hoping they will look at this film as the stepping stone, correct the weaknesses and raise the bar. However the one thing that is for sure, no matter how many transformations The Thing takes on...this... is where it ultimately took hold!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent update</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter takes Howard Hawks seminal science fiction tale about the remote polar research station beset by an alien invasion (by which I mean invasion by an alien) and updates it from the 50s to the 80s - in colour, some genuinely low temperatures, and some state of the art mechanical effects rather than James Arness in a rubber carrot costume.It's pretty good. The sense of claustrophobia and paranoia is well generated and maintained, the performances are all good (and Kurt Russell is an excellent lead), and the effects are imaginative, shocking, and extremely well executed.Remakes often fall short of the originals: this one surpasses its predecessor by a clear margin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horror, like hot sauce, is a kind of self-indulgence. It's considered part of the sport to try to push the envelope, be it a seared mouth or a heart attack. I think John Carpenter has designed a movie for the audience who says, "C'mon scare us to death."Every element of this movie is exquisitely crafted -- from the soundtrack to the cutting and pacing to the uncompromising, unrelenting savagery -- all packaged in sharp, handsome photography and skilled acting. The buildup is a crescendo of violence and gore.But what's the point of all these fine production values? A message? Existential dread? Survival? Compare this one to Alien. Both climax with the hero calling out the great terror. Like cowboys. You know, the outlaws move into town and kill everybody until they meet the lone hero in the final showdown. Here, the story is just a vehicle for the real purpose of this film: pure horror.Almost 30 years later, and John Carpenter's The Thing is still the scariest movie I've ever seen. If I lived for being scared to death, then I'd give it a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know if it's too bad or too good that not so many people love horror movies but I find it strange every time somebody is surprised that I am a horror genre fan! Horror movies talk to our most basic instinct which is fear and stimulate our numerous fears in different ways. And the good thing too is that whenever your fear is quivered, your intellect moves up in a very profound way using all the possible weapons that one could think of just for the sake of your own survival. There you go, adrenaline of heart and mind both revived each time you watch a horror movie and specially a decent one like "The Thing".Nothing more really can be said to add to what all the other reviewers said about the movie director, the original short story, and the acting. Excellent movie and you deserve to treat your heart and mind with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Remake Of The 1951 Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given that this movie received largely negative reviews when it was released in 1982, I confess that I decided to watch it mostly out of curiosity to see how bad it really was. After viewing it, what I don't understand are the views of the critics. I thought this really was a superb remake of the 1951 movie of the same name, different enough to be a totally unique movie-watching experience, but maintaining the same basic plot. My attention was captured from the very beginning, with the scenes of the helicopter chasing the husky across the antarctic landscape, with a gunman on board desperately trying to kill the animal. What's going on? Once we discover that the dog is in fact the alien being (an alien who consumes its victims and then takes on their identical form) the story progresses and becomes completely bewildering (appropriately so, because a big part of the suspense is that neither the viewers nor the characters in the movie know who has been infected by these aliens and who hasn't) and at the same time extremely suspenseful, and sometimes downright frightening.Kurt Russell did a great job in the lead role, and was surrounded by a very capable group of actors who put on a fantastic show. Perhaps worthy of note is that this may be the only movie I've ever seen with an all-male (and I mean totally) cast. There's not a woman to be found in this one. The setting (in an isolated Antarctic scientific outpost) is bleak and claustrophobic, in spite of the fact that there's a lot of open space, and so very effective in creating the perfect mood. The movie is rather gory at times, and the idea for the alien creatures is perhaps borrowed a little too obviously from the movie "Alien." The end is completely anti-climactic and leaves a great deal up in the air, which suggests perhaps that there was hope for a sequel which never came to pass because of the poor reception this movie got. That poor reception was mistaken, though. This is an excellent movie. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Cold War Science Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a teenager, seeing this movie in the theater in 1982, I was gleefully ecstatic about the gore factor in this movie. The nightmarish body props coupled with artfully selected sound effects put this film solidly in the "hard R" category -- and my younger brother and my cousin's squeamish reactions bore that out. Unfortunately, at the time, the critics couldn't see past this, and The Thing was panned and then forgotten.But 20+ years later, the violence scale has slipped enough that when you get past the ooze and the blood and the ripping teeth, you're left with a model of paranoia-packed, "who-can-you-trust?" invasion-type Sci-Fi. The cast's performances and the taut dialogue really string you out then leave you hanging -- in a great way. And Ennio Morricone's understated score perfectly seals the deal. Carpenter should have called him up when he started production of "The Mouth of Madness."If you're looking for a good Cold War alien yarn, and you want something a little harder-edged than "Invasion of the Body Snatchers," but didn't enjoy the remake, give "The Thing" a spin. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The essence of the modern horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember my brother renting it just after it came out on video. I still carry vivid memories, both of the flick itself and of how it affected me. It was then (and is still to this day) one of the most unsettling, frightening movies I've ever watched. I got so overwrought that I got sick to my stomach and had to leave the room for a walk in the fresh air. I came back just before the end. For years I had dreams of sitting with my back against the wall holding a blowtorch or a gun on my best friend and saying "Now we wait a while". I get the creeping willies just writing about it even after all this time. Gazooks what a film.When it came out, I heard rumblings of "What has Carpenter done to this classic!?!?!" Well, what Carpenter did to this classic was make it into the living breathing definition of the term "horror movie". It's not that it was so gory or unpleasant to look at (tho it was that), but it imparts that gut-wrenching feeling of abject inescapable spirit-crushing doom that you feel by the end of the flick - really rivets it to your soul and then leaves you sitting there on the ice floe too freaked-out to blink.I've heard that one of the marks of a truly good movie is how long it stays with you; by that measure, this is an all-time cinematic success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally saw the uncut version - oh my God, what have I been missing out on!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The other day I finally saw an uncut version of John Carpenter's "The Thing". I had had no idea what I had been missing out on. This movie has up and away the best special effects that have been created during the 80's! The best thing, though, is that "The Thing" also has an interesting story to back up the gory moments.Even more so than its elder brother "Alien", John Carpenter's movie creates a tension of suspense that has yet to be rivaled by a similarly themed sci-fi/horror-movie. Up until the very end the director makes great usage of the basic premise that a monster from outer space can disguise itself by taking on the form of any living being. The movie is tense and tight all the time and with Kurt Russell it's got a badass-hero, too. Still, Carpenter never falls into the trap of making any of the characters in the movie a stereotypical clich of the 80's like so many later flicks who stole from "The Thing" would. There is almost no moment here where you can only shake your head because of the obvious stupidity of some of the characters' actions.So, having seen the real, the untouched version of "The Thing" I have to say that I think this is John Carpenter's best movie and one of the most effective horror movies of the 80's period. Just steer clear of any cut versions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>These days, where we get overwhelmed with horror movies which fail to build up suspense without falling into stereotypes, its hard to single out a horror movie different from todays "teenie shockers". There are two main aspects which ought to captivate the watchers attention. On the one hand you have this really disgusting "thing," incomparable to anything i have ever seen before in other movies. On the other hand there is a constant distrust evolving from the beginning to the end which affects every action of the characters, whose feelings the viewer is compelled to identify with. Not knowing who is infected, you suspect nearly everyone, even "R.J. MacReady," who can be seen as the main character. For me this was a new experience insofar as there is actually no one in the story you can sympathize with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely Gory, But Extremely Intelligent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an era where nearly every great horror film of the 60s and 70s is being remade for audiences weaned on horror flicks of today that are not too terribly good, it is instructive to look back at John Carpenter's 1982 opus THE THING, which itself is a remake--of a childhood favorite of the director's, Howard Hawks' 1951 sci-fi/horror classic THE THING FROM OUTER SPACE. Although Carpenter's film was not initially that big a box office hit when released in mid-1982, it has since garnered a very large following.In fact, Carpenter's film is less of a remake of Hawks' film than it is a reworking, as he goes back to the original idea posited by the source material, namely the John W. Campbell story "Who Goes There?", in which a US scientific crew in Antarctica is menaced by a shape-changing alien thawed out from the ice after 100,000 years. Kurt Russell, who had starred for Carpenter in the director's 1979 TV movie ELVIS and the 1981 film ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, heads a cast of stalwart character actors, including Keith David, Donald Moffat, Richard Dysart, and Richard Masur, in this tension-filled exploration of paranoia, as the shape-changing "thing", which first comes to their camp in the form of a guide dog a Norwegian team is trying to kill, takes over each of them one by one. It isn't long before everybody in the camp begins to mistrust his fellow man. The ending of the film, in which Russell and David are the only ones left, has a disturbing and chilling ambiguity akin to the similar codas to both THE BIRDS and STRAW DOGS.Almost universally, when the subject of THE THING is bought up, the emphasis is on the extremely gory special effects make-up and alien designs created by Rob Bottin, who had worked with Carpenter on the 1980 horror classic THE FOG, and on Joe Dante's 1981 werewolf film THE HOWLING. These effects are indeed quite spectacular and graphic, and even today, they can also be quite stomach-turning. But all of this would make Carpenter's film nothing more than a high-end splatter epic if the direction, the story, and the acting weren't up to snuff; and thankfully, each of them are. When he's not concentrating on the enormously gruesome transformation sequences, Carpenter builds suspense in the same Hitchcock-influenced way that informed his previous films HALLOWEEN and THE FOG, with cinematographer Dean Cundey's prowling camera-work, particularly through the corridors of the station, a significant help. The acting enhances an already-fine screenplay adaptation by Bill Lancaster; and we are also given a taut score by Ennio Morricone, whose work on director Sergio Leone's classic 1960s Italian spaghetti westerns is well known to all, including of course Carpenter himself. THE THING also features additional fine visual effects from Albert Whitlock (who worked on many Hitchcock films, including THE BIRDS), and Roy Arbogast, who worked on CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and JAWS 2.Carpenter's film was not the success it could have been because Universal chose to release this graphic shocker a mere two weeks after it had released Steven Spielberg's far more family-friendly E.T.: THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL (not surprisingly, critics and audiences at the time favored Spielberg's excellent film over Carpenter's equally excellent but exceedingly different one). Also, most of the horror film box office business in 1982 was going to another Spielberg-produced film, POLTERGEIST. As a result, at a cost of $15 million, THE THING suffered from lack of attention in its time.Over time, however, many have come to see Carpenter's film for what it is--an extremely gory but extremely intelligent combination of science fiction and horror, done with a great deal of flair and a true understanding of the psychological paranoia at the heart of its story. Though it is still quite gruesome, THE THING should be as much remembered for the skill by which the story is put together as it is for the gory alien designs and make-up effects; for it is the storytelling skill and the suspense that make it so memorable in the final analysis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Thing' was one of those big cinematic blind spots for me. This film like many cult classics didn't enjoy critical or box office success at the time of its release, but has gradually over the years become a very popular and loved movie. This was my first viewing of the film and my review is based on a single viewing.I don't think it is possible to watch 'The Thing' and not get reminded of Ridley Scott's 'Alien'. Both films came out in round about the same time within a span of 3 years. Both films are about a team of people isolated in the middle of nowhere being hounded by an alien monster. However, 'The Thing' didn't impress me anywhere near as much as 'Alien' does every time I watch it.Let me first point out the elements of the film that I liked. The practical effects that are on show in the film are some of the best ever put on screen. There are moments of sheer terror due to the convincing nature of the practical effects. Another positive aspect of the film is that John Carpenter really knows how to build up the tension. He knows how to subtly move the camera or hold a shot for just the right amount of time to create a sense of dread in the mind of the viewer. Another great aspect of the film is the dog that we meet right at the beginning. Carpenter somehow got the dog to perform as well as any animal I have ever seen perform on screen. My problems with the film stem from the lack of depth in the script and lack of depth in the characters. 'Alien' works so well because it has so much going on underneath the monster film surface. It is a commentary on the gradual loss of human qualities in the age of capitalism along with the exploration of disturbing themes like rape and unwanted pregnancies. Unfortunately I did not find any subtext in 'The Thing'. I have read some articles where people have tried to find an allegory for the Cold War, but I just didn't observe any depth in the screenplay to think along those lines. Another huge problem is that I found the characters to be very bland with no depth what so ever. In 'Alien' we don't get much back story about the characters either, but Ridley Scott used multiple scenes where we found the characters engaging in small talk and being as realistic as possible allowing us to relate with them. 'The Thing' has almost no quiet scenes where the characters are talking about ordinary, banal stuff. That just didn't make the characters interesting enough and since the characters weren't compelling enough, I found myself losing interest slowly and at the climax of the film I really got bored.As I wrote earlier, this review contains my opinions about the film after watching it once. I might change my stance with subsequent viewings. But right now, I have to say 'The Thing' left me underwhelmed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thing is one of the best movies that I've seen. Now the movie was made at times where CGI was totally unknown and that makes this movie even better. Make a remake of this movie using the latest special effects and you wouldn't get a movie that is so "physical". John Carpenter gave a lot to this movie and it really does deserve to be on the 'best 250 list'. Its far from all the 'already seen' even at those times and now and its beyond every predictable plot or stupid characters whose actions are beyond reasonable thinking. I bought this movie because i think its really worth to be in any collection and even more if you are a horror fan.

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** As the film "The Thing" opens we see this sled dog trudging through the vast Antarctic wasteland of ice and snow being chased by a helicopter. Opening fire on the dog the Norwegian pilot, Larry J. Franco, seems to be terribly agitated at the dog escaping his rifle fire and then opens up a grenade canister and throws it at the fleeing canine. After what seems like forever the dog reaches the US scientific outpost #31 and as the men stationed there run out to see what's happening the pilot starts shooting and throwing grenades all over the place like a man gone insane. He's then shot and killed by Garry, Donald Moffat, after the crazed pilot earlier ended up accidentally blowing up his helicopter with a loose grenades. Finding a partly burned map of the outpost that the dead pilot came from Dr. Copper, Richard A. Dysart, together with US Army helicopter pilot MacReady, Kurt Russell, fly out to the place only to find it burnt-out with everyone there frozen or burned to death. By MacReady and Dr, Copper taking back one of the dead bodies to be examined they brought,together with the runaway dog that was already taken into in the US encampment,into play one of the most hideous monsters that was ever put into a motion picture. A monster that laid dormant for tens of thousands of years until the Norwegian Antarctic expedition dug it out of the ice and inadvertently released it. A horror that within three years could very will wipe out the entire human race by first replicating and then destroying it. Unlike the original 1951 movie "The Thing from another World" the John Carpanter directed films storyline follows very closely the famous 1938 Sci-Fi short story "Who Goes There" by John W. Campball that both films were based on. Surviving through the process of replicating itself in it's host body "The Thing", after wiping out the Norwegian outpost, turned itself into a sled dog and then ended up getting into the US base #31. At the base "The Thing" started to take over the bodies of first the sled dog and then the men stationed there by initially infecting them in order to enter their system. Then, like an unending row of domino's, "The Thing" goes from one person to another until "It" destroyed every living thing, human animal and plant, on earth. Looking something like a cross between a giant spider and octopus "The Thing", when it was in it's natural state, looked like a nightmare that came straight out of hell. But when it infected and took over someone on the base, and hid itself inside the persons body, it acted perfectly normal and human until the opportunity presented itself for "It" to strike again. It was only too late that the US military men and scientists at the base-camp began to realize that once "The Thing" got into their camp the only way that it could be stopped was for them to destroy everything living that it came in contact with, the entire base-camp with them along with it. Not making the same mistake that the Norwegians did by unknowingly allowing it enter their encampment and then later escape, after wiping them out, and continue it's murderous rampage on earth. With the fires that were started by him and his men, battling "The Thing", slowly burning themselves out MacReady and Childs,Keith David, the last two survivors of this inferno wait for the bitter minus 100 degree Antarctic winter to set in and thus put them out of there miseries. Shearing a bottle of R&amp;B whiskey to numb their senses they both sit and wait for the end to come knowing that with their actions they put an end to "The Thing" and it's ability to use them to farther it's demonic goal in destroying all of mankind.</fullReview>

Death, horrible death, now figures at every step of plot development. The movie is mostly interiors as the base personnel and the alien battle for survival. Outside is the deep freeze, and certain death. Inside is confusion and violence, and inevitable death, though the hopelessness of the situation, death for all humans and the alien is not revealed until the end. There is no happy ending, only destruction and suicide. The cast are impressive, the special effects convincing. I rate this as as one of the best of the sci-fi horror genre.

The story itself is creepy enough but Carpenter's vision created a memorable horror film out of the story.The first thing that one notices is the element of icy isolation. The group of scientists are in the cold desolation of the Antarctic and loose contact with the civilized world. - That in itself is enough to scare the daylights out of most people.The second thing is the thing. An alien life-form that cannot be seen, is not ghost-like, yet it's presence is well known.The third thing is the suspense and mystery. A mystery of how the creature lives and survives. And the suspense of who is human and who is The Thing! This is a long time film favorite of mine and I do recommend it for those that love aliens stories mixed with horror.On a personal note: I when I look at spiders I sometimes think of this film - the character of Vance Norris (Charles Hallahan).10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back when SuperChannel was the channel to have to watch movies, I remember watching this on TV. It was very scary and with all the lights out we had the most fun watching this flick. I even got my leg grabbed for fun to scary me and it worked. I was young but this movie was major influence on my loving movies and classics like this. I can watch this movie over and over again because it is timeless. If you have never seen then it, it is a must for sure. You just never know who is the Alien and who isn't and in the end it still holds, because even the alien believes he is real till he is discovered. I can only think that this alien was on a ship, a ship made by others and one day this alien will come in force to earth to see what happened to BOB(their alien friend), even though he got frozen thousands of years earlier I think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake that far surpasses the original . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen Carpenter's version of "The Thing" now over half a dozen times. Even so, there are scenes where I hide my eyes because they have the power to still scare the bejesus out of me. This is, IMO, one of the scariest scifi horror films ever made and John Carpenter's best work . . . ever. The suspense is heart pounding, the performances uniformly terrific, Carpenter's direction is flawless, and Rob Bottin's monster effects are timelessly terrifying and the star of the film. If you've never seen Carpenter's version of "The Thing" and you're a fan of scifi or horror (or both), you MUST see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter's The Thing is just like the creatures in the film. It can not be described in words, it has to be seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter again shows that he is one of the greatest directors of all time, and is a true master of horror. The thing which is a remake of a already quite amazing and timeless Sci-Fi film The Thing from Another World (1951). Taking that its a female is already a extremely hard task to make the film stand on its own since it will no doubt be compared to the original one, like all other remakes tend to be, but in this case the Remake surpasses the original and also stays more faithful to the original source material, the short story called " Who Goes There?" by John W. Campbell, Jr. John Carpenter not only found a way to stay more fateful to the original short story, but also incorporated the original film into the mix as well as we see in the film that some thing recall the event of the original 1951 film, which in a strange way make Carpenter's The Thing a sequel to the The Thing from Another World. The Thing (1982) posses all the key factor is not only creating a great film ,but also creating a great suspense driven story. The cast of only sixteen actors is quit astounding since they all have such distinguished charter and can be easily distinguished instead of simply the viewer remembering only three or four charters that carry out the film by themselves, but no in this film ever character matters and has a crucial role in the films progress. The effect by Rob Bottin are top notch and surpass anything that Avatar (2008) could possibly do with its unlimited resource in CGI. THe story is fantastic and as we go along deeper and deeper as the if,m goes on the paranoia between the character transcends into the viewer and make the viewer feel as if he/she was in the film along with the characters. The can be a Billion more good things said about the film, but the best thing I can say about the film is that it has to be see right away and afterwords it will stay with the viewer for a vary long time and will become a great re-watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Cheatin' bitch" sneers Mac (Russell) when the computerised chess bitch check-mates him. At least he gives her a glass of his J&amp;B whisky. This didn't look like it would be an iconic film one day, but it is now (try buying the film poster for less than ?100). It wasn't a great film, and it still isn't. But it is a very good sci-fi / horror. Russell is a supercool ice-crunchin alcoholic. Something not nice comes out of the ice, and things start getting drippy and sticky. The special effects are "no way man - check that" quality and, for me, have never been surpassed. The imagination involved is pleasing, and there's some really good, tense drama. So, what's mince about it? Nothing really. Closest thing to it in 'feel' I would say is ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, for many obvious reasons. Both films are VERY 80's in style - wee bit clinical, with electro music travelling with us on our quest for impending doom.</fullReview>

If you like horror movies, you need to see this one.I only recently learned that this is part 1 of what Carpenter refers to as his Apocalypse Trilogy, followed by Prince of Darkness and In the Mouth of Madness, two other movies that you should definitely watch if you enjoyed this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What can you say about a horror movie that's made history and still stands up today as a special-effects extravaganza? See it again! Now!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's "The Thing" is a legendary movie. For me, it's a movie that gets better with each viewing and still stands up today over 30 years later as a marvel of atmosphere, special effects and existential dread. Whether intentional or through sheer luck, or perhaps an unlikely combination of both, the filmmakers who made this incredible opus have made one of the few greatest monster movies of all time that not only delivers the grisly goods of gory kills and nightmarish creatures but even more importantly is so meticulously paced and plotted with such vivid characterization of seemingly ordinary men isolated and trapped in a nightmarish wasteland that it naturalistically questions, perhaps without even meaning to, the nature of trust, identity, and the extent of human relationships on a professional and personal level based purely on the instinct to preserve the idea of "self" as the truest form of survival. This is not just a survival movie where the characters will do anything to live, including compromising their own integrity at the expense of others like so many shallow modernistic survival horror movies have done lately in order to seemingly justify extreme and seemingly sociopathic behavior. No, "The Thing" questions at what point does a decent caring person have to act on their own, perhaps even against the group, for not only the sake of his/her own good but for the good of the group as well to avoid being destroyed by the very human collective paranoia and hysteria that may be even more insane and monstrous than the thing causing it. In a group where trust has broken down because anyone could be a monster the question becomes not who has the right to assume authority but who will be authoritative enough over themselves to take a leap of faith in trusting someone who might lead them to their destruction. Is the greatest feat of "self" deciding to resist the potentially compromised authority of another person or deciding to take a leap of faith by submitting one's trust and ultimately one's will to someone who may prevent you from destroying yourself and others in a fit of fear and paranoia? These are the kind of ideas and themes explored in John Carpenter's "The Thing" and add to that mind-blowing special effects that put current CGI to shame even today and you've got an unique unrivaled masterpiece that is as deep and terrifying as it is dazzling.I love this movie so much I own two copies of it on DVD just in case one of them bunks out all of a sudden. So there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the only words that pops in my head after seeing this is sci-fi and horror, and of course, the thing. This is probably my favourite horror film. why? because I think the idea is simply genius. A bunch of men going somewhere in Antarctica and some creature just randomly appears in the base. OK, starting like this doesn't make that movie look any good, but the rest of the film is just so powerful. The screenplay, the actors, the plot, the intrigue, the fact that we always want to know what will happen next...all those elements make this film a true masterpiece. Why, why in hell most of the recent horror films just don't get even close to this and just keep being bad? I'm actually watching the remake of The Thing. I'm about half of it and think it's pretty good but my guess is that it's not gonna be better than the original. Plus, I find the character that Kurt Russell plays very interesting. And by the way I find this actor very flexible in his roles. Very good actor. The Thing, by John Carpenter. A must see.</fullReview>

For a film that is now over 30 years old it still feels like it could be released now and do well. I went to see the prequel and the use of CGI in that takes away everything that makes this film stand the test of time. I introduced my 13 year old son to it and even he enjoyed it and commented that it doesn't look dated. If you are looking for something different from the modern horror movies and want to see a great Director at work then watch this film, you won be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thing is an imaginative and highly original horror film, also containing great sci-fi elements in it. Director John Carpenter did a terrific job at building the suspense here and there were plenty of genuinely creepy moments. The practical effects were excellent and still hold up quite well, being actually more effective than the overuse of CGI these days. I liked seeing the extreme tension surrounding the crew, constantly not knowing who could be trusted in the group. The concept of this alien life-form that can assimilate someone, creating a perfect imitation was very intriguing to see and there is a lot of mystery in this film, making it always an engaging watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter directed this superior remake of the 1951 original, based on the famous short story "Who Goes There?". Kurt Russell plays a pilot(R.J. Macready) in an American research base in the Antarctic, that one day is confronted by a helicopter with two people trying to kill a dog with a rifle. The two men come from a Norwegian base, and after both of them are killed, Macready flies them over to that base, where they find the remains of an alien spacecraft, and a thawed out block of ice, along with some frozen mutilated remains of the Norwegians who are brought back to the American base, which is soon overrun with the revived alien life forms after both the dog reveals itself to be a thing, and there is still life in the bodies being autopsied...Extremely effective horror/Sci-Fi/ remake creates a palpable sense of fear and paranoia among the all-male cast, memorably acted by all, and impressively made with groundbreaking F/X that are quite believable and hold up today. One of the rare remakes better than the original, and actually has a point to it! Not usually the case sadly...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thing review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the great horror films. This classic starts off in a base in the middle of Antarctica with no one but a team of 12, until one day 2 men from a nearby base miles away are brought there after trying to hunt down a hound. One from the team kills the foreigner and they take in the stray dog. After investigating what appeared to be a frozen-alien tomb, the team get more than they bargained for when the stray dog starts to show its true colors, and identity. The special effects are spot on and puts the characters in the position of trusting one another to see who's reliable, and who's deniable. Only side effect is that the movie can get slow at times, but that's why we learn to be patient. This movie definitely goes down as a horror original. 3.5*/4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no denying that this film's effects and production have not aged well. The special effects are dated and naff to the point of seeming a bad 80's parody (blood spurts that look like an Italian evening in gone wrong). Fortunately the underlying themes and structure of the movie are still gracefully intact. All that you need to know about the plot is the film title. The less you know the better, for the film has little interest in The Thing or why it is there. What is the focus is the reactions of those stationed at the camp. The audience is constantly left in the dark about things: questions and accusations are brought up but only half answered or at times discarded. You only know as much as the characters. There are not cameras panning around to points of key interests, no internal monologues of any the characters or flashbacks, everything is focused on the present moment. Yet despite being set in the present moment there is little to no time structure. It is hard see when a day ends and a new one begins, which really compliments the sleep deprivation, paranoia and rage experienced by some of the characters thorough out the film. When watching the film, try and ignore the by today's standards laughable effects and modeling of the thing and instead focus on the characters for as the movie goes on it becomes less about the things and more about the character's reactions to said thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Icon Of A Perfect Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this at the drive in (now you know that I'm old), when it first came out - and it was sweet! This is actually one of the very best horror films that I have ever seen. John Carpenter did well.I also remember that even before that I had seen the original old 1950s version on T.V., and that one even holds up pretty good today. Overall - it seems that the basic, original story plot and premise is so good that it works almost completely on it's own merit - so far - every time it's made (or more accurately "remade"). The original story that both films are based upon - entitled "Who Goes There?" - by John Campbell, seems to have been a literal magic formula for the perfect model of horror. It seems to press just the right buttons in our brains to reliably work.The core premise to the 1980s version is terrifying to contemplate. Imagine a compound creature that can infect you with tiny, microbial versions of itself like a virus just by physically touching you even briefly - and then slowly eat you from the inside out while it replicates and grows, and perfectly copies every cell, every organ, every tissue it consumes ruthlessly - until all that is left of you is an imitation. A creature that can just "absorb" you by touching you - or infect you with itself by spraying you with it's bodily fluids. The absolute definition of a "monster". A trail blazing - red letter concept, and a ground breaker for the Sci Fi and Horror genres.I have seen this film about a hundred times, and it's still creepy and blood curdling every time I see it. If you can get a Blue Ray, DVD, or digital downloaded copy of this movie - then I strongly recommend establishing viewing it as an annual Halloween night ritual. It goes great with dim or no lights, popcorn or T.V. dinners, soda pop, a comfy sofa, and a friend or family member - especially if they are easily spooked!</fullReview>

Right to the end you try to guess who became The Thing and who have saved the human qualities. Besides, stunning special effects create a sense that the monsters will come out of the screen. I sure, the main idea of the film is about how simply people can leave their friends for saving their own skin. But there is a thing that disappointed me: lack of a good soundtrack. I need something more then only couple of two terrifying melodies which we can hear in almost every horror film. All in all, film The Thing is not bad ? in my opinion, it will be interesting for those who prefer to pull the nerves.</fullReview>

This ends up being a movie that keeps you at the edge of your seat. Once the scientists realize there is a good chance someone will get affected that ads to the suspense in this this movie. You don't really know who to trust. You don't know who is going to be next affected by the shape shifting alien. The alien itself ends up being this spider like creature which is really creepy. It may gross you out but I didn't bother me much. This movie was made before you started seeing CGI in movies. This was made well before these type of horror movies became more popular. Now we have horror movies all the time where a group of people get trapped and something bad happens. There are movies like The Thing except they are not as good. For 1982 this a well made horror movie. I have seen other 80's movies where the special effects weren't as good. I don't know how high I would rate this movie but this was a good movie. You will most likely enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimately creepy and unsettling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before this adaptation of John Campbell Jr.'s novel, "Who Goes There?", came The Thing from Another World (1951). Many people liked it at the time for its effects and thought provoking story line. But, I'm not sure if anyone suspected someone could overpass it. John Carpenter, the director of famed slasher movie Halloween (1978), takes on this project and executes it without a hint of weakness anywhere. At least none that I could see which seemed like a real flaw.The story is about a group of scientists in Antarctica than happen to come across a perplexing and dangerous threat. The threat is a creature of unknown species that has the power to perfectly copy the DNA of any organism it comes in contact with. Because of this, it allows the creature to devour its prey very easily. Over time, this creates high tension amongst the men because no one knows who is really themselves. However, the one individual who does his best to keep his cool (pardon the pun) is R.J. MacReady played by veteran actor Kurt Russell.It does not surprise me that Russell is in this film. Russell began working with John Carpenter back in the TV movie Elvis (1979), and they continued to make movies together since then through the 1980s. Along with Russell is Wilford Brimley (better known for having a mustache but shaved for this role), Richard Masur, Keith David and so on. Through the whole film, each actor gives their best performance in displaying the sheer terror in not knowing who is human and who isn't. But like most fans, Kurt Russell is the star of the movie and he puts in the best out of all performances because he's able to keep calm.Besides Kurt Russell, another notable part of this film is the overall set design and special effects. There are only a few places where a viewer can tell that it's not real but it won't matter because it will complete the whole picture. As for creature effects, Stan Winston is the main reason why everything worked so well. The gore is absolutely horrendous. It's not like tons of blood are being thrown everywhere but it's not pleasant either. The sounds are just plain icky and imagery is gross. Oddly enough, what impresses me even more, is that by the end of the film, the viewer still won't be able to give a good description of what this creature's original form truly looks like. It really just is, "the thing". There's no other way to explain it.The final touch to this film that really strikes fear into most viewers is Ennio Morricone's haunting film score. The instruments that play a big part in each track are the harps, flute, violin and bass notes that repetitively beat in the background. If that kind of music were to be played on a dark night in an alley or dim lit subway, I would feel very uncomfortable. But the reason why it is so much more effective in this setting is because besides the base that is man made, where else can one run? Antarctica is no beach walk. That's the scary part. This movie isn't in it for the jumps and shouts - its goal is to make you feel terrified. A true horror piece.John Carpenter's version of the 1951 film increases the gore, the terror, the musical dynamics and brings in a great cast to boot. Not for the queasy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nightmare in Antarctica</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What induces the most horror? Many different people will offer many different answers to this simple yet profound question. One of my strongest fears would stem from isolation. Not having any source of protection for myself would be a nightmare, but what I am trying to say is that I think the strongest stimuli of fear would be anything that triggers our vulnerability as human beings. I personally love to watch horror films not only for the thrill of the scare, but for its atmosphere for I feel it plays just as big of an influence on our senses just as much the plot.That isolated atmosphere plays a strong role in triggering a feeling of dread in obvious films being Stanley Kubrick's The Shining (my personal favorite horror film) and Ridley Scott's Alien. Both are able to utilize this idea, but in ways that are each unique to its own story, and that could very well be said about the remake of 'The Thing.' In comparison to 'Alien,' it has that element of science fiction, but it not only gives a feeling of doom in its environment, but it also manages to evoke feelings of paranoia through the characters. While 'Alien' and 'The Shining' feel isolated, you also feel a sense of possible danger from anyone of the characters featured in and that is where that feeling of vulnerability is triggered while watching 'The Thing.' While in other horror movies, we may know who or what we're running from, but it seems in 'The Thing,' we lack that awareness and there is no place to escape.This is a bleak film that will leave its mark on you that will get under your skin. There are grotesque moments, but the fascinating thing about it is that it uses no flashy CGI effects and the realism makes everything from the blood and gore really shock inducing. I would also like to add that the look of the alien monster is just as grotesque and manages to instill fear. While the alien in 'Alien' is horrifying, the creature in 'The Thing' is a much more rabid beast that will brutally kill anything to adapt. The scary thing about the 'thing' as compared to the alien from 'Alien' is it possesses no emotion and that is what gives these creatures the edge over humans.I cannot recommend this film enough to fans or the horror genre. It is definitely a must see, not only for it being scary, but also utilizing the feeling of fear in its own unique way with its acting performances, set pieces, choreography, designs, and especially its story. If you are looking for a horror film that is memorable, then do yourself a favor and watch 'The Thing.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the thing as a principle of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>without a doubt the most fascinating aspect of the movie is the thing itself. It is not so much a "form of live" as a "life of form" or rather a life as such. It is an embodiment of evolutionary principles, of survival and reproduction which in the case of the thing resembles reproduction on a most basic biological level. The thing is more replicating itself than reproducing like a mammal.In a way than the thing succeeds to show the "dark side" of life or maybe even the very essence of life. It shows what life is really all about in a Darwinian sense.there is an episode in which a doctor is calculating statistical probability of the thing's spreading on earth and the computer shows terrible results according to which the thing if contacted can spread worldwide in couple of days. Well it can be read as a hint to how vulnerable humanity is in reality or we can also read it as how vulnerable the world is to life itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lets get ready to hide,jump and scream as The Thing has come to your door. As Antarctic explorers come across a dog being chased and shot at by mad Norwegian explorers they take it into their care. But are they as mad as they seem? This movie takes you to the edge and back messing with your mind in the process.This film will make you think and contradict yourself to the extreme, confusion will take over as you wonder who the thing actually is and fright will consume you as you see who is and who isn't. This film is truly amazing and should be marked as one of the great films that the world produced next to The Dark knight and The Dark knight rises.I give this movie a 9.5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cold, isolated gross out fest of awesome proportion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's remake is yet another example of a remake outshining the original. While every critic in the world thinks "The Thing From Another World" is a better film, it doesn't come close to the claustrophobic atmosphere and the sheer horrific gross out factor of f Carpenter's film. Of the two, "The Thing" is more pure horror.So a group of scientists in the Antarctic are just kind of doing their everyday thing, which is nothing, until a helicopter shows up and starts shooting at a dog. One of the scientists is hit, and the guy in the helicopter is killed. Confused, some of the scientists visit the camp the pilot came from, while the dog is put with the others.In the camp they find a burned body of something that doesn't appear human, but turns out to be. They also find a video of the camp digging a ship out of the ice. So on a return trip, they find a rectangular hole in the ice which appears to be where there was once a body.The dog then tries to latch onto other dogs, and its face explodes apart. Well, what we have here is a shape-shifting alien who can't quite stay stable for some reason. And this is a cause for concern, as anything it touches, it can replicate. So whoever had contact with the dog could be an alien.This makes Wilford Brimley's diabetes reach uncontrollable levels, and he starts smashing things in a paranoid rage. Luckily, Kurt Russell is on break from the Roadhouse bar and punches Brimley's character Blair in the face, then locks him outside.Slowly, the situation deteriorates even more. One character's stomach turns into a human arm venus fly trap, then his head detaches and grows legs and antennas. Which had me laughing on the floor. The effects in this movie are outstanding. In fact, they're the highlight of the film. But the nice thing is, they don't overshadow the plot. Everything is tight, and you honestly are left guessing who the alien is at any moment.Kurt Russell is incredible in this movie as well. So, yes, I recommend it. Just as an aside, if you're going to watch the new "The Thing" from 2011, watch it first. It's a prequel to this movie, and isn't too bad. As far as this and the original "Thing From Another World" , those are two very different movies. But both are worth watching._____________________________ For all of the Horror Banana's reviews, visit http://morozov924.hubpages.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With smart visual effects and leveraging on the drama potential the plot had - it is a decent horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a heavy B movie feel to this but it is a damn good B movie. It packs quite a few genuine scares and definitely enough suspense to hold your attention. I am also quite impressed by the visual effects used smartly and only when required. Acting could have been a lot better though. Set in Antarctica, the movie starts with a Norwegian member of a different station chasing a dog on his helicopter and in the act ventures into the American station's territory and injures one of the members while fully absorbed in his mission. They put him down, take the dog and decides to investigate what is going on in their camp. When they realize that a shape shifting Alien is among them consuming and imitating one crew member at a time, they stop trusting each other and more so themselves. The starting sequence is eerie that pans out quite leisurely with simple yet terrific background score. The build-up to the Thing could have been a little more progressive like in 'Alien' than one guy listing down what all it is capable of just by examining it's blood sample. Where the drama triumphs is the tension between the characters to trust each other than the fear of the Thing itself. It does have innumerable logical loop holes but clever enough screenplay that puts them on the background. There isn't enough emotion captured be that of fear or disappointment of not be able to make it back home. Some terrific scenes to look out for - 1. The dogs scared to death when the Thing put in their cage transforms for the very first time. 2. The starting sequence. 3. Some fantastic visual effects for the time - a man's head parting from the body developing spider-like legs and crawling off. 4. When the Thing transforms while all the crew members are tied to a bench. It may not live up to your expectation if you believe in all the hype around it. But with smart visual effects and leveraging on the drama potential the plot had - it is a decent horror movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the greatest sci-fi horror of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How great is The Thing? Up there with 'Alien' and 'The Fly' as the greatest sci-fi horror ever (interesting that The Fly is also a remake of an earlier film). Ironically John Carpenter says that what attracted him to the story was that it wasn't about another group of dumb teenagers getting sliced up by some psycho when he practically invented that genre with Halloween. But he's right, all the characters in The Thing are capable, intelligent men faced with an unbelievable situation and dealing with it pretty admirably. Good things abound in this film, the special effects are terrific and still stand up after 30 years. The plotting is great, we're still debating aspects of the film to this day, you see something new every time you watch it. Set pieces such as the scene with the dogs, the defibrillator sequence and the blood test scene are simply marvellous. The dialogue is terrific; Garry's rant on the couch just pipping Palmer's incongruous spotting of Norris' head scuttling away. Also fond of Clark upon discovering The Thing attacking his dogs "I don't know what's in there but it's weird and p*ssed off!" Fantastic soundtrack too, amazed that John Carpenter didn't do the music himself because Enrico does a great job, full of foreboding and tension. Good acting especially given the fantastical nature of what they're reacting to. Very little bad although it does seem a little trite that The Thing turns up in the one place on Earth where you'd reasonably expect people to have flamethrowers handy but you forgive it. So what happens in the end? Personally I figure neither Mac nor Childs is The Thing (especially given the earring revelation of the 2011 film) and either a military helicopter turns up or Kate from the 2011 film arrives in her snow cat to take them to safety. But who knows what other secrets the spaceship contains? I'd love to see a scene where they are able to contain someone infected with The Thing and ask it what it actually wants? To conquer the world, to go home or is it some sort of interplanetary explorer which is taking samples in order to understand our world? All told John Carpenter at his finest</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thing Is A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's The Thing is both a remake of Howard Hawks' 1951 film of the same name and a re-adaptation of the John W. Campbell Jr. story "Who Goes There?" on which it was based. This science fiction horror film is directed by John Carpenter and written by Bill Lancaster.It features Kurt Russell together with Wilford Brimley,Keith David,Donald Moffat and Charles Hallahan. The title refers to its primary antagonist: a parasitic extraterrestrial lifeforms that assimilates other organisms and in turn imitates them.It infiltrates an Antarctic research station, taking the appearance of the researchers that it absorbs, and paranoia occurs within the group.Carpenter's film is more faithful to Campbell's story than Hawks' version and also substantially more reliant on special effects, provided in abundance by a team of over 40 technicians, including veteran creature-effects artists Rob Bottin and Stan Winston.The screenplay opens enigmatically with a Siberian Husky running through the Antarctic tundra, chased by two men in a helicopter firing at it from above. Even after the dog finds shelter at an American research outpost, the men in the helicopter land and keep shooting. One of the Norwegians drops a grenade and blows himself and the helicopter to pieces; the other is shot dead in the snow by Garry, the American outpost captain. American helicopter pilot MacReady and camp doctor Copper fly off to find the Norwegian base and discover some pretty strange goings-on. The base is in ruins, and the only occupants are a man frozen to a chair and the burned remains of what could be one man or several men. In a side room, Copper and MacReady find a coffin-like block of ice from which something has been recently cut. That night at the American base, the Husky changes into the Thing, and the Americans learn first-hand that the creature has the ability to mutate into anything it kills. For the rest of the film the men fight a losing battle against it, never knowing if one of their own dwindling number is the Thing in disguise.The Thing is a peerless masterpiece of relentless suspense, retina- wrecking visual excess and outright, nihilistic terror.This is one of Carpenter's greatest moments, creating a terrifying atmosphere of claustrophobia, suspense and paranoia. And Kurt Russell is as good as he's ever been, wearing one of the best beards in movie history.Added to that,the special effects can't hope to be as creepy to our seen-it-all eyes as they were to the film's first viewers, but we can still enjoy the monster's unique weirdness, and the story is a rock-solid yarn.And most of all,it is not just an excellent remake, it's an excellent movie, and an almost perfect horror movie as it shows more originality, wit and invention than possibly any other film in its category.Also,it is as influential as Alien for its blend of action, sci-fi and chilling horror.Finally,it is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's something to be said when a 30+ year old movie has more actual horror in it than the majority of today's "scary" movies. It took me a while to actually get around to watching it, and I'm very glad I did. John Carpenter hasn't always made gems, but this is certainly one of, if not the, finest he's ever made in his film career. The actors were almost perfectly chosen and worked well off each other and help to add to the overall tone.Great movie, great horror scenes, and great action all around. If you're an adult, watch it, and if you're a kid, definitely watch it. As Halloween approaches, this is one movie I can definitely recommend.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Astonishing Piece Of Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right well what can i say other than a film that is so astonishing it still holds its own 23 years after release. I had only ever seen this film once since last night, and that must have been when i was around 6 or 7, and i barely remember it at all, but what i did remember was how great of a film it was, so i asked for it, and did happen to receive it as an Xmas present the other day, and decided to whip it into my player at 2.30 in the morning, all the signs of a john carpenter film were there, the slow beat and already chilling atmosphere (Literally!) A film set out in the south pole and something there with them, how could you resist! But what i love about this film is how its done so different, they find out about this "thing" and decide to research it a little, they even at one point fly out to a certain area, i won't give away what for, but its not till one of the characters destroys the mechanics of the chopper they get stranded, but what i love about the entire sequence of destroying is how you second guess if he is doing it to stop the thing getting out or whether he is doing it to stop the people getting out, thats the charm of this brilliantly enclosed movie. The paranoia is high, even with the viewer, you question everybody's actions and motives, are they infected? Or just totally scared by this entire situation, a masterful scene is when Kurt Russells Mac-Ready is talking to the entire crew, saying how one of us is the thing, but is hiding, and doesn't want to show itself, and you see a stunning smooth shot of each man, and its surreal trying to pick out which one, as it could be any of them! And what supports this entire idea is the idea of being stuck in this Arctic station, i love nothing more than a film about a group of people stuck in a place with something outside trying to get in, but the charm of this is you have the same structure, but the thing is inside trying to get out, john carpenter directed the original assault on precinct 13, you can see he does like his enclosure movies, and i love most enclosure movies, from dusk till dawn, Assault, most Romero dead movie, etc, but this has to be the best one by far, i saw it for the second time last night and was truly captivated by the mood and atmosphere, its done brilliantly, and you want to talk about Special FX, forget all this modern CG crap, this is the stuff here, some of it is truly sick, i won't spoil it, but as the guy that did the effects at the young age of 22, he truly is a master and this is a sickening but lovable film, some great performances also, Kurt Russell really shines, its obvious this and escape from new york made his career, i just wish he would return to these sorts of roles instead of trying to be funny, he plays much darker characters superbly, i urge you all to sit down late on at night, alone when the night is quiet, and watch this, it truly is a stroke of genius, and one of those films that has made my top 5 best films ever list, and that says a lot because some of the amazing films I've seen, this does enclosure a lot better than most, it is also one of the few films that has furthered my ideology of just what kind of film maker i want to be, i love these sorts of films, playing with the audiences minds, letting you second guess instead of going for the cheap special effect, if i do make it in film, you better well damn believe i won't be doing anything generic, you could say for my age I'm very old fashioned and psychological, and films like these just make me want to make it more so i can possibly bring some of this back to the movie business, but overall The Thing has it all, and one of the most chilling atmospheres in a film, the lack of a musical score all adds, i am already a fan of the slow beat that remains, and watching this last night, has made another impact on what i hope to achieve in life</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter's The Thing is truly a master piece. Carpenter is masterful at setting up suspense in this film, and the creature effects are hands down amazing. They will inspire you. a head sprouts legs and walks away, which should be all you need to know to want to watch this film. This film is the best suspense and the best carpenter film. This film creates a world that you can feel and believe. It is leagues above the crap cg that studios are obsessed with. I mean CG is good for what it does, but for building suspense and creating realistic monsters, you need the innovative style that comes with the creation of creatures. You need substance and puppetry to truly do that. The cast is also great, Keith Davis, Kurt Russel are just a few of the great actors of this film. You will really get an understanding of nearly every character. A truly great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know a lot of people love Carpenter's "Halloween" and consider it his masterpiece, but this is easily my favourite flick of his, especially as I tend to prefer monsters of the monster kind, as opposed to the human kind.Everything comes together well here...great ensemble acting, amazing effects, excellent script, incredible tension and atmosphere and great music by Ennio Morricone. Even the dog is great! This is one of those classic horror/sci-fi flicks that is great to own on DVD, as you can go back and watch it regularly, since it holds up so well. Extras on the DVD are great too.What is there more to say that hasn't been said by others here? This film comes with a high recommendation for lovers of the genre, so be sure to check it out.</fullReview>

They are the type of people who watched pulp fiction and thought it was trashy rubbish. This film originally received terrible reviews and nearly ruined John Carpenters carear! This was the man who saved the horror genre with Halloween, and he was slated for a film that is, from mine and many other Carpenter fans point of view better!!!! The direction is outstanding. It follows the first rule of horror to the hilt and isolates its victims very artistically and gripingly. The special effects are lighters ahead of its time and used, contrary to popular belief, tastefully and well. While it is gory, it is not the gore fest that many would have you believe. If you haven't seen it then you must!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Horror Movie Should Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes today are seemingly ubiquitous in Hollywood. Most of them are unnecessary (e.g. Alfie), or unwarranted (e.g. Dawn of the Dead), and damned near every single one is crap. But there is always the exception to the rule: John Carpenter's The Thing is the exception to the Iron Law of Remakes. It goes off in a different direction than Howard Hawks' Thing (which is trite "Doctor, look at the geiger counter!" 1950s rubbish), but stays more faithful to the original source material. This film is a horror masterpiece, without flaws, false notes, or counterfeit nonsense that makes the viewer say to himself "Oh yeah, I'm watchin' a movie." The script is taut, the acting superb, the credibility factor unassailable, and the special effects tremendous. I don't think Hollywood realizes just how artificial and awful CGI is. The effects in The Thing are gross, gory, and organic, and they never made me shake my head once. Let's put it this way: the 1982 special effects for The Thing do the job they're supposed to do--tell the story--better than anything George Lucas and his oodles of nerd-loot managed twenty years later. This is a film to own, and I can't sing its praises enough. Last point: I've seen the movie numerous times, and know how the plot works out...but the film is so well-made, such a classic, that I'll stick with it if I chance upon it on cable because it's that good (cf. "The Godfather).</fullReview>

Just seeing the immense paranoia that grips these 12 men in the antartic is so real that you can feel your self getting paranoid. John Carpenter who is the one of the great horror directors did such a good job with this movie taking you into the world of paranoia and what it can do to men and what they will do. So if you want to see a good horror movie The Thing is one of the best movies to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter's The Thing, is possibly one of the most incredibly designed Horror movies that I have seen. Its gruesome atmosphere and chilling story made me cringe at the thought of being stuck in that same situation. John Carpenter definitely did a great job on this one. From "Halloween" to this, John Carpenter is a pure genius. One of my most favorite parts in The Thing is when they find the dead Norwegian strapped to the chair frozen, and when they find the open ice chamber where the thing slept for years.The atmosphere in this scene is so dark that I couldn't wait to see the rest of this movie. The most popular parts about The Thing has got to be the Gore. This movie redefines the Horror genre, and easily claims the top of the violence meter. Next to The Exorcist, The Thing is a definite must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Left me wondering why I hadn't seen it sooner. Carpenter is a master film-maker.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the last couple of years, I've been watching as many John Carpenter movies as possible. I fell in love with Escape From New York, and practically worship Big Trouble in Little China. I love the energy that Carpenter directs his movies with, I always feel they're special and unlike anything else out there. It's no different with The Thing. My question is, how does Carpenter do it? The Thing is a horror masterpiece. The movie is based on a book called "Who Goes There?", which is rather fitting considering the plot. In 1980's Antartica, a research team accidentally stumble upon an alien that can change it's appearance to look like anyone through cell-transformation. As it begins to wreak havoc and mayhem upon the research facility, it becomes clear that nobody can trust anybody else. Paranoia sets in, and a perfect horror mood forms. It's all very clever.Leading the campaign is MacReady, a brave and cool helicopter pilot played perfectly by the awesome Kurt Russell. Again, Russell and Carpenter craft and amazing character together, just like their previous legend; Snake Plissken. MacReady rounds the men together and attempts to destroy "The Thing", but things do not go as planned.For a film made in 1982, the special effects are top-notch. They look realistic, which makes a change (the 80's was a big special effects testing zone, which wasn't necessarily a good thing). It's gory and violent too, and never did I find myself thinking, "Oh God, why?" Ennio Morricone composed the music, influenced by Carpenter's classic synthesised tunes. I was impressed by the main theme, a sort of basic tense number; it succeeded in keeping me at the edge of my seat. This score however, was totally different from anything I'd heard Ennio do before, which made a refreshing change.Overall, The Thing is one of my favourite horror films (and one of my favourite films, to be frank). It kept me interested and tense, whilst thrilling me for the full running time. The acting is superb, as is the direction by one John Carpenter. Ennio Morricone's score was simple but effective, and the special effects just finish off this piece of perfection film-making. In one word, spectacular.(5/5)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carptenter's Greatest Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film back in 1996 for the first time and have since never been without a copy in my library. I watch it at least 10 times a year and each time I see something new, make new assumptions, and get the same excitement from watching it.The original "The Thing From Another World" was typical grade-B sci-fi move that was actually quite well-made for its day: unfortunately, the monster was James Arness in a suit and essentially a vegetable. Even today Hawk's version seems to get more accolades than Carpenter, but in a strange and rare twist, the remake is actually phenomenally better.The Thing takes place in Antarctica 1982 and subjects a team of Americna scientists, mechanics, pilots and fuzzy radioman to an alien life form that can assimilate any organism it touches...anything. The team has to figure out who' human before spring allows it to escape. Because the thing is an imitator, it has no singular shape, so every time we see it, we see only a mass of blood and flesh from other lifeforms it's assimilated over its travels in space.The characterizations are admittedly weak because we don't have the time to get background, but in a way, this works because when the thing possesses someone, we're left to wonder what clues it gives away,if any. Nevertheless this has some superb acting by a wonderfully interactive ensemble cast that definitely puts Keith David into his "always bad-ass" character that he plays so well.Other than that I feel that this film is The Perfect Script. It's not too long, not too short, has a brisk and energetic pace, leaves plenty of clues hidden and obvious, great material presented in the right way, and is one hell of a mystery than can cause you to look back over and over again for any possible clues you may have missed. I've since noticed almost no continuity mistakes, but am always discovering new clues and hints. This film is THE blueprint for studying the structure and execution of a suspense film, much more so than many of Hitchcock's films.No other film by John Carpenter has ever managed to be as perfect or as outstanding or enjoyable as this (although They Live was fun), and I would recommend it to anyone who has not seen it. If I were stuck on a desert island and had to choose two or three movies I'd have to choose, this one would be #2, no question.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had no problem whatsoever giving this horror flick 9 stars. The rating pertaining to the fact that this is, without a doubt, one of the finest sci-fi horror films ever produced. Carpenter takes us on an intense psychological thrill ride that easily stands up to the test of time, as does all great film. Kurt Russell plays the lead role with such relaxed intensity, suffice to say, this has to be his finest performance EVER in a motion picture. Had Kurt over the span of his career procured more roles similar to this he would have easily been considered one of the finest character actors in the history of film, guaranteed.Unfortunately Russell chose such parts as that of 'Captain Ron' or the zaney jack of all trades in 'Overboard'. Sealing his fate as a mediocre comedy actor at best.'The Thing' proves otherwise and leaves us longing for a Kurt Russell RE-DO where Kurt would choose his roles far more carefully in turn leaving us with a legacy rather than a laugh. After viewing Russells stellar performance in this film to say its a crying shame or a case of unrecognized talent... would be an understatement. It must be understood that this film is far more than sci-fi horror it also covers the full gamut of human emotion that takes place when one is cast into a hopeless and desperate situation while being cruelly isolated by uncompromising conditions.John Carpenter, Kurt Russell and the supporting cast(who happen to be magnificent as well) more than achieve their goal of 'bringing us there' with an intensity only such classics as 'Alien' could possibly boast.This film was not given its due by critics upon release. However I would be willing to bet since that time many producers-directors of horror and psychological thriller alike have used it as a scale by which to measure their work.Considered a cult classic. Be sure to rent(or buy) the revised version. Don't expect modern day special FX to carry this one (oh no this film is far too good for that!). Its the stellar acting, isolated settings and interesting storyline that bring this one to life. By far some of the best acting in horror film history. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter's remake of 'The Thing' was buried at the box office by another visitor from outer space that went by the name of 'E.T.' But the passage of time has seen this movie gain a serious following thanks to home video, and many people now view 'The Thing' as one of the all-time great horror/sci-fi films.A group of researchers at an Antarctic science facility are unwittingly exposed to an alien organism that has the ability to perfectly imitate any life form it comes in contact with. As the gravity of the situation becomes frighteningly obvious, and with no way of contacting the outside world, the men struggle to determine who's human and who isn't, as the alien life form slowly moves through their ranks, taking them over one by one.As an exercise in paranoia, 'The Thing' works very well. The characters don't know who to trust, and neither do we. With the exception of one scene early on, no one is shown being 'taken over' by the Thing, meaning anyone could not be all that they appear to be. In the original film, the monster was a visible, hostile menace. In the remake, the monster can look and act like your friend, much like in the original short story both movies were based on. Carpenter gets maximum mileage from this concept, milking the paranoia and dread for all it's worth.But still, this is a horror movie at heart, and horror fans won't be disappointed. While the Thing prefers to stay hidden and secretive, there are numerous scenes where it is drawn into the open and/or revealed, and the end results aren't pretty. These sequences are startling and gruesomely imaginative, thanks to the shocking make-up effects done by youthful special effects wizard Rob Bottin; some of the things he comes up are bizarre and frightening (check out that 'spider-head'), and these scenes still hold up, even by today's standards. On the basis of these sequences, lots of critics dismissed 'The Thing' as a snowbound 'Alien' clone, but that's not an accurate assessment, although there are some similarities.Still, there are other scenes where the movie is effective: the opening scene with the helicopter is mysterious and strange, and the exploration of an abandoned camp where unspeakable things happened is eerie and haunting. The 'blood test' scene is very suspenseful, and the payoff will make you leap from your chair. The ending of 'The Thing' is refreshingly downbeat and bleak, and is a nice change from all those 'happy' endings we've had to endure.'The Thing' has improved with age; what was once dismissed as a 'freak show' has evolved into a classic horror/science-fiction movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give this a 10 of 10 because I saw this many years ago, when I was 9. (Yes, I know a 9 year old shouldn't see this, but that's a whole other story.) Anyway, this scared the crap out of me and I have never been so scared - to this day I cannot see this without all the lights being on in the house. I remember at the time I saw this, we also had a family pet that was a German Shepard. The dog in the movie, if memory serves, was also a German Shepard. After seeing that "thing" come out of that dog I couldn't go around ours for months. I suppose the original fear of the movie has stayed with me all these years, but for me, the scare factor in this alone warrants a 10 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is very cool It is John Carpentars best film and the best Sci-Fi Horror ever made. It is similar to Alien but is better. Some people may not like it because of the gore but i don't find it that gory at all. It is well directed by Carpentar and has a good score from the great Ennio Morricone even though it was nominated for a razzie. The story of 12 men in the south pole with no communication and no helicopter being attacked by an alien that changes form is brilliant. Kurt Russell has acts excellently as MacReady, the central character and a man born to lead. To all fans of Sci-Fi such as Alien or Horror such as Halloween or gore like Dawn of the Dead this is a must see. 9/10MAN IS THE WARMEST PLACE TO HIDE</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOLIERS* I love this movie it bring to me what horror movies and sci fi movies should be. The story was really good it is about a alien that crash landed on earth in the Arctic and was dug up by Norwegians. As soon as the movie starts you hear that chilling music and the Norwegians shooting at the dog that later you find out is what causes this whole thing. I really liked Kurt Russel in this movie as he played R.J. MacReady.The thing i really like about this movie is to fully understand it you have to see it more the once or you just feel like you have to because the first time you may miss a few things. The movie was a little crazy with the blood though but not to bad. The movie can bring chills down your spines at some moments. If you really like horror movies i really suggest you see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Creepy After All These Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's adaptation of "The Thing," is a gore-fest from start to finish. Since it's release in 1982, viewers are still amazed at the special effects, which still hold up pretty good.In the Antarctic, a group of researchers are thrown into a horrific nightmare when a dog shows up, being shot at by a group of Noreigians, that REALLY want the dog dead. Later, the group of researchers, lead by MacReady (Kurt Russell), stumble upon a spaceship at the Noreigians camp, with other information: a creature that can become anything or anyone it chooses. This really becomes evident when the dog, which is in a kennel with the other dogs, shows what it REALLY is, in one of the most disturbing scenes in movie history (And still creeps me out!).Soon the researchers begin to suspect each other, knowing that the creature can assume ANYONE'S identity. Paranoia and distrust runs rampant, as one by one the creature begins to take over each of the group members. In one memorable scene, a blood test is used to reveal which of the members is the creature. You get so caught up in who you THINK is the creature, that when you find out the truth, you really are shocked. The film has you on edge from start to finish, although there are some unanswered questions (What exactly happened to Nauls?)that I wished were explained.The Thing itself is a nasty piece of work: This creature can inhabit every square inch of a victim's body (even the blood). Each incarnation of the creature is as graphic and as disturbing as the last. And the atmosphere in the film makes the situation even more unsettling: The group is in the middle of nowhere, with temperatures below freezing and dropping each and every second. Their modes of transportation are destroyed and no one can trust each other. They are trapped with not just the creature, but with their own understandable paranoia.2 of my favorite lines: Wilford Brimley,as Dr. Blair, going insane and screaming "I'll kill you!" and David Clennon, as Palmer, when he sees his friend's head turn into a spider creature and walks away, says "You gotta be f***ing kidding!" Great movie to be included for Halloween, or when you just want to have a good scare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is in the top 5 best horror movies made. REAL special effects, not fuzzy, computer-generated, animations. If you had the chance to see this in the theater when it was released, you will notice a difference between the home VHS version of 1982. Has anyone else seen the uncut version, 128 minutes long? The common version is 109 minutes (or 1 hr. 49 minutes) I saw it in the theater and rented the 128 version so I know it exists, but I haven't had any luck finding one to purchase. After you see the long version, you will realize how much is lost in those 11 minutes and the common version will appear choppy. Regardless, this movie will press you back in your seat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Admitedly, you can't rate this movie along side with Alien, Blade Runner or 2001, but for a schlocky horror-science fiction movie it is among the best. The characters are smart and the dialog feels real. While the characters are not as developed as they might be in other classics, they are real enough to be utterly convincing - some panic, some think things through, some just try to ride it out. A great deal of tension is built from the effective setting and the developing paranoia among the characters. The title monster is one of the best in movie history. I would love to see a sequel or prequel of this movie (about the fate of the Norwegian base), as long as it is done with the care and flavor of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who goes there? A classic, of course!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Antartic; a dread desert of ice and snow. There aren't' much things (no pun) to do in such a place. Yeah sure, you can do some jazzy experiments-thingies and have fun with your fellow scientist. But after several days, the place gets pretty much boring and all. Now of course, a movie, a scary one, couldn't only rely on 12 isolated men in a giant freezer, that'd be rather dread and not-so-scary. Now here comes the big fat fun, a mysterious alien life-form decide to hop in and play a little game of ''Who's who?''.The main thrill about this movie is having that ''thing'' as they call it imitate any living creature around. So guess what? humans too are copied and thingised. All in all, we are left with a crew of dazingly isolated scientists dealing with pretty much the worst nightmare any man (no woman here, sorry ladies) could be confronted with; can you thrust anyone in this wretched station? Am I the only human here? What If I am the Thing and I couldn't tell?Mass paranoia, beautiful creature effects, frightening atmosphere; this movie is flawless. It is a established classic and shall live on remembered that way. I highly recommend it to every horror fans, you wont go unsatisfied. My rating; 10 out of bloody 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, let's start with it's more than just a classic movie, and obviously it will always remain fresh. Perhaps that's because the producers really spent enough money to make one of the best alien movies in world history. A group of American scientists have to struggle an alien parasite not to let it get out of Antarctica and infect the rest of the Earth. The thing is a damned good arranged special make-up. For the beginning of 80's ? I still can't believe this film is one year older than me taking into account what I saw. I still don't believe it. You won't see nothing like that in movies nowadays. The makers really did a nice job.The atmosphere is A+, Ennio Morricone's name says much as the score writer, the directress is good, plot comes up with every minute you watch the film, and every spec. effect is more beautiful than the previous one. Very rich!In one word, super movie. I'm not Carpenter's fan, I've only seen "In the mouth of madness" but I'd rather watch his other films after this one. It was fairly good. 10 of 10!Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must congratulate John Carpenter on this fine film, for I feel it will remain the best of his career.Now I know some people will argue that the film nowadays will look dated and tacky, but in my opinion some of the effects in this film look better than some of the rubbish rendered by computers in today's films.The setting of this film is beautiful, I felt myself being drawn in by the snowy white artic tundra - adding a sense of mystery and uncertainty to the film before it even begins.Now without wanting to ruin the film for those who haven't seen it, basically the film is about an alien than can imitate perfect human form. Simply this film is a clever study of the characters interacting. It all boils down to trust between these people, reflecting if they will survive.You can't help but be drawn in by this story, genuinely wondering who 'the thing' really is at the different points in the story. It is marvelously executed, and the end just adds a sense of mystery to the whole story.The film is very entertaining, not over long - and definitely should remain a classic for many years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carpenter does it again with his remake of The Thing from Another World, but does the unthinkable by making it superior to the original. Extremely atmospheric, excellent effects which to this day have not been beaten, scary, thought provoking and ambiguous, good characters, great story all make The Thing one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever made.Out in the arctic are a crew of men, working for months at their outpost. With little contact with the outside world, little entertainment and the same 10 or so faces every day, life can become monotonous. One day a helicopter appears, shooting at a dog on the ground. The 'copter lands, and the pilot shots one of the outpost crew, who is in turn shot and killed. The other pilot accidentally blows himself and the Helicopter apart. The dog is taken inside the camp, and the men decide to investigate. They realise that an alien spaceship was uncovered, and that a being which can reproduce itself many times by killing its host and making an exact copy has invaded their base. it could be anyone of them, or two, or 3...and soon the men are falling to pieces, not trusting anyone. A test is worked out to decide who is real, and who isn't, leading to a final confrontation.A brilliant idea, flawlessly executed, The Thing is one of those films which can be repeatedly watched without becoming boring, and we can find new things each time we watch. Some brilliant dialogue in the typical vein of Carpenter, spoken by typical Carpenter characters, and a haunting score all add to the atmosphere. We do not know who is what or what is who, but it never becomes complicated. Our paranoia grows, the isolation soon affects us as it does the characters, and we do not know what to expect next. The effects are, quite simply amazing- the arms being bitten off, the digs changing, heads turning into spiders, they are insanely innovative and work wonderfully. Russell as Mac is a strong leader, but only because he wants to get out alive, and if that isn't a possibility, then he won't let the thing get out either. The whole world would be screwed if that happened. As the rest of the cast are good actors, but hardly established names, this adds to the mystery. Palmer is funny, Childs is volatile, Blair loses it quickly, each man has their own traits, but the thing knows this.The ending has gone down as a classic cliffhanger, another classic Carpenter trademark- we must imagine what will happen to any surviving character, the story is over but we will always want to know more. We wonder if the thing is dead or not, if it is how will anyone get out, if it isn't, what does the future hold. Carpenter was at his prime here, and when he is, no-one is better.10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter's Best Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie on New Years Eve for the first time and it made an impact on me. It introduced me to John Carpenter. At that time, I had not scene any of Carpenter's movie, except for Halloween, but even then I was about eight. After watch The Thing, I now own every mainstream John Carpenter movie and love the guy's work. It showcased some spectacular gore, creepy score, excellent performances, and a great story, illustrated with genuine paranoia and fear. First and foremost, the astonishing special effects in this movie are one reason to watch this movie, even if you don't like horror movies. Rob Bottin and his crew created, in my opinion, the most realistic gore effects second only to Day of the Dead. My favorite is either in the dog kennel or the scene with the defibrillator. WOW! I won't say anymore. Do yourself a favor and just watch this movie.The score, though not composed by Carpenter, is unsettling and creepy. It fits the movie perfectly and doesn't overpower it at all. To this day when I watch it, I am still creeped out by it.Even though there are 12 guys in this movie, they are so different and well developed that I can name all of them right off the top of my head. Even the minor characters like Bennings, Fuchs, Nauls, and even the Norwegians are memorable and enjoyable. Kurt Russell gives a fantastic performance here as R.J. MacReady, even rivaling his role of Snake Plissken. This man means business and I would want him to be one my side if push came to shove.Keith David as Childs is wonderfully sarcastic as usual, I mean the man is an expert at playing this role. A. Wilford Brimley plays Blair perfectly. The man can act. The other supporting characters are great too, especially Norris and Clark.The story, based on the short story "Who Goes There?" is adapted perfectly. The fact that it's set in Antarctica already ups the isolation factor. Add in 12 uneasy, unstable and panicky men with a shape-shifting alien that can imitate anything perfectly, and the paranoia level is cranked up to 11.This movie is one of the few movies that actually scares me. The movie itself is creepy, but after you watch it, I guarantee that it will stick with you and creep you out. Go out and either rent or buy it. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kurt's battle cry: "[BLEEP] you, too!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An American scientific expedition to the frozen wastes of the Antarctic is interrupted by a group of seemingly mad Norwegians pursuing and shooting at a dog. The helicopter pursuing the dog lands and is accidentally blown up and the Norwegians killed, leaving no explanation for the chase. During the night, the dog mutates and attacks other dogs in the cage and members of the team that investigate. After hitting the hideous monster with the flame thrower, the team soon realizes that an alien life-form with the ability to take over other bodies is on the loose and they don't know who may already have been taken over.John Carpenter's remake of the 1950s sci-fi thriller "The Thing That Took Over the Earth", based on the story "Who goes there?"A long, dark, stomach churning voyage that probably saw more than a few resemblances to the AIDS epidemic on account of how the human body deteriorates because of an alien invader in the blood stream."The Thing" did okay at the box office, but having been released within two weeks of ET undoubtedly hurt its box office potential. Thanks to the afterlife of video and DVD, the film now has a cult following like "Buckaroo Banzai". Solid acting all around from the under-used and unappreciated Kurt Russell and the gang. Proof that blood and gore, when used properly, can add authenticity to the product. Kurt's battle cry to the Thing before blowing it up - "[BLEEP] you, too!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ADDENDUM TO MY EARLIER REVIEW</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RE: Ennio Morricone's excellent score to this movie. Sadly, Carpenter used a fraction of the music Morricone actually composed for this movie. In an interview, Morricone said that Carpenter never gave him an idea of the type of score he wanted, so Morricone composed a wide variety of cues, but Carpenter used mostly cues that sounded like his own work, which is strange because Carpenter has stated that Morricone is one of his influences. Though Carpenter praised one of the orchestral cues on the audio narration of the Director's Cut of THE THING, little of Morricone's orchestral cues made it into the movie, including my favorite piece, which IS on the soundtrack, called BESTIALITY. Morricone has said the reason he produced THE THING soundtrack himself was to let people hear some of the orchestral music that never made it into the movie.There is talk of a THE THING II (I guess based on the comic book), and Carpenter and Russell are interested, but two people that are not expected back are Bottin (as he is off directing some movie or so the reports go) and Morricone, who was not happy with the way his music was treated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Psychological Paranoia Thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This can definitely be considered one the greatest scfi/horror to date.Plot: The movie takes places in an isolated research camp in the middle of Antarctica. The first week of the winter season is starting, and the research team is threatened by an alien intruder that has the ability to "imitate: other organisms. (mainly the researchers). With the temperature dropping outside and all hopes of escape gone, the tension rises between the men as know one trusts the other. Review: From the beginning you feel bits of isolation that turn into extreme claustrophobia. The isolation then combines with the paranoia giving off the feeling of pure terror. Who is the thing? As you ask yourself that questions through out the whole movie, John Carpenter does an excellent job combining the ambiance and the score to give you ideas that are often mislead on the identities of the men.Acting: The cast of actors do an incredible job, making the situation believable. Kurt Russell (R.J. MacReady) and Keith David (Childs) are extremely noteworthy during the film. Special Effects: The special effects are impressive, and in my opinion would hold up in movies today. The monster looks very real. The only down side was the excess slime. I prefer less. I am not a huge fan of John Carpenter, but this movie proved he can do a true horror. If you want a REAL scary movie, then check this out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been a big fan of this film since it was released in '82. I went to see it at the theater (with the other 7 people who were there as well) and enjoyed it a lot. I immediately purchased the 20th anniversary DVD Edition a couple of years ago and enjoyed that as well. However, I watched it recently and I realized that this film does not stand well over the test of time. The reason could be that we, as science fiction fans have seen the best special effects money can buy in the past 20 years. When I watch this movie, even though the effects were great at the time, now they seem quite tame.Also, even though the film had it's tense moments, I feel that there was too much talking. Also, one scene in particular, when the men first see "The Thing", they have a meeting afterwards to discuss what to do. They begin speaking to the "Helicopter Pilot" on what to do! They have a couple of scientists standing there, but, instead put their trust in this guy. I could never understand that scene.However, even with these minor flaws, the film is still one of my favorite science fiction movies of all time. I am a big John Carpenter fan but I have noticed that many of his films have missed the mark and did poorly at the box office. Having said that, this does not mean that his films haven't been good entertainment.I have been waiting for a sequel for over 20 years but that will never happen. Usually films that die at the box office do not warrant a sequel. Still, I think it would have been a good story.Ringo</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apart from the fact this is one of the best and most comprehensive special edition DVD's ever produced the film itself is an absolute classic bordering on masterpiece. Staying true to the spirit of Joseph Campbell's short story WHO GOES THERE? (the basis for Howard Hawks' original b/w version) Carpenter's THE THING brought Rob Bottin's mechanical special effects into the realm of high art. The original story is an allegorical tale of the fear and paranoia created by the anti-communist sentiment pervading the 1950 / 60s USA. Communist paranoia was transposed into Sci-Fi / monster movie in Hawks' version but Carpenter, having no need for this in the 80s, brings a contemporary fear to his version - that of illness. Carpenter's version plays on our fear of what may be inside us or those close to us (a type of left wing horror - fear of ourselves as opposed to right wing horror - fear of them) whether it be disease such as aids or mental illness, it is this kind of atmosphere that saturates this film and is made manifest by Bottin's truly viscerally terrifying special effects. Every aspect of the film is top notch: the acting (with the ever excellent Kurt Russell and a magic ensemble cast), the cinematography from Australian DP Dean Cundy (long time JC collaborator), the effects (as mentioned), the amazing snow covered exteriors and Carpenter's effective, intelligent, economical directing. One of the best horror movies ever made that stands up today as if brand new - a true keeper, enjoy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter's "The Thing" is truly an exceptional horror film. I am glad that the film is beginning to earn acclaim. As you watch the film, you begin to feel the loneliness, hopelessness, and terror that the characters feel. Being isolated on a polar icecap with a team of colleagues, one or more of whom might be a killer alien, with no means of escape would certainly invoke terror in me. The special effects are not highly technical, and I like that. They are realistic. The main thing (excuse the pun) that makes this film great is the acting. The actors convince you that what you are seeing is real, and that they are really in danger, not a group of actors pretending in front of a camera. Kurt Russell is great, but he is just one of the fine actors in the film. Many of them are character actors.I especially enjoyed the performances of Wilford Brimley, Keith David, Richard Dysart, and Donald Moffatt. If the film were cast with lesser-quality actors, I don't think the film would be as good. One other item: this film is reminiscent of "Alien," but that's certainly not a bad thing. Both films are excellent, and although they have many things in common, they are two separate, distinct films, each worthy of viewing and enjoying on their own. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just in case anyone didn't notice this, the thing liked the cold. It wasn't trying to get to a warm climate. It was trying to infect more people, regardless if they lived in Hawaii or Norway. MacReady specifically said that the only way for the thing to survive was to freeze again. That's exactly what the dog-thing was also trying to do. As long as it was frozen, it could basically experience immortality. This is an obvious variation from the novel.However, I especially like the comment about the Norwegians. No disrespect to anyone who's Norwegian, but I would be pretty scared too if someone came up to me and started speaking Norwegian and carrying a pretty big gun, obviously being ticked off about something.I was wondering: when both the dog(I'm sorry, I forget his real-life name!) and Palmer are transforming, it seems like they were in a lot of pain. As Jeff Goldblum's character in Jurassic Park established, evolution can be a very painful process, and I can't think of anything more painful than going through it in a few minutes. Maybe it's just me. What do other people think?I'll send some more theories on Blair later!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the summer of 1982, audiences flocked to theaters to spend time with a visitor from outer space named E.T. Around the same time, another visitor for the depths of space was also stalking multiplexes, but he was far less warm and fuzzy as E.T., and went by the name The Thing. Although it was not a box-office success upon original release, John Carpenter's remake of the Hollywood horror classic has gone on to achieve cult success over the years, and stands as one of the scariest horror films I have seen to date.Based on a short story by famed science-fiction author John W. Campbell, Jr., entitled 'Who Goes There?', The Thing was brought to the screen in the 1950's by famed producer-director Howard Hawks in what is viewed as a seminal horror classic, although it heavily deviated from the source material, and generally doesn't stand up to scrutiny for modern audiences. When bringing a new version to the screen, Carpenter and screenwriter Bill Lancaster stuck closer to the source story and crafted a tale of paranoia and isolation that works on your nerves and rarely gives you a moment to relax throughout it's running timeSet at an American Antarctic research station in the dead of winter, The Thing opens with two Norwegian scientists from a nearby station chasing a dog across the barren wasteland in a helicopter, attempting to shoot it. They arrive at the American camp and in their attempt to kill the dog appear to attack the members of the American party and are themselves killed in the process. Curious about what would lead the Norwegian scientists to follow such a strange course of action, the American expedition's doctor, Copper (Richard Dysart) and helicopter pilot Macready (Kurt Russell) make their way to the Norwegian camp and discover it destroyed and all members of the expedition dead, some in rather mysterious ways. They also come across a video recording of a recent dig the Norwegian's performed at a nearby site as well as a block of ice that was carved out of the ground and appears to have contained something approximately human-sized. Copper and Macready then investigate the dig site and discover a large saucer shaped space craft in the ice. They quickly determine that the object in the ice was a creature from another planet that was excavated and thawed out, and shortly thereafter, the dog that the Norwegian's were chasing reveals it's true nature: an alien shape-shifter that can take on any appearance it chooses, and can spread to multiple individuals at the same time, essentially replicating itself at will. Blair (Wilford Brimley), the lead scientist, upon discovery of this fact destroys the expedition's radio and all means of transport with the intention of ensuring that the alien does not spread to the outside world, knowing that if that were to happen, humanity itself would fall, replaced by replicating things.The Thing is, much like the classic Invasion of the Body Snatchers, a film that asks the most basic of questions: Can you trust the person sitting next to you? As realized by Carpenter and Lancaster, The Thing keeps you guessing and unsure of all the characters throughout the film, constantly putting them in situations that could lead to them being consumed by the thing, or just as easily not, leaving the audience unsure of who is human and who isn't. The tables are turned on characters several times through the film, causing our belief of who is and isn't infected to constantly be in a sense of motion. One of the film's strongest aspects is that most of the characters, while not supremely well defined, are given enough personality and individuality for us to root for them to come out of the ordeal alive, giving us a stronger stake in the events on screen. If we didn't care for these characters at all, the tension and suspense wouldn't work nearly as well.The film is also helped by a strong sense of isolation. Like many horror films, such as Alien, placing the characters in an environment with no way out gives you an even greater sense of unease, and you can feel how the characters are trapped by their surroundings, as well as by each other. One aspect of the Thing that was groundbreaking at the time was the make-up effects crafted by Rob Bottin. In the early '80s there was a rash of films that were based around elaborate make-up effects, and The Thing is one of the standouts. Almost all the make-up effects are spectacular and create the appropriate sense of revulsion and horror that they should. Some audience members will be turned away by the sometimes extreme nature of the effects, but they are actually much less bloody and disgusting than countless other horror films that came about as the decade went on. What is featured in The Thing does not feel gratuitous.Most of the performers in the Thing were character actors who were not big name stars, but they all do the job well. Kurt Russell, a longtime collaborator of Carpenter's, is effectively low-key and straight in the face of some rather incredible situations as the film progresses. He grounds us in the film and makes us believe what is happening on screen. Wilford Brimley is also notable for his performance as Blair, a man who understands the implications of the situation they are in and slowly goes mad because of it.While hardly the most original horror film, The Thing is an effective entry in the genre, and one that is worth seeing if you like being scared.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic horror/science fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John carpenter's The Thing is an adaption of the short story 'Who goes there', by John W Campbell. It's a story of trust and suspicion, set in the isolation of an antarctic research outpost. This is brilliantly atmospheric, the ominous music score by Ennio Morricone adds a great sense of dread as well of lots of tension to the story, the cast all do a great job with what they have, and Rob Bottin's creatures are truly amazing. The movie is not without faults though, one of them being the lack of character development, however I understand carpenters intentions to keep us guessing about the characters.This is a genuinely effective horror and an intriguing science fiction movie, well worth a place in any movie lovers DVD collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Horror/SciFi; Just Wish They Kept Campbell's Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's impossible for me to discuss John Carpenter's "The Thing" without also discussing several works that provided its inspiration. J.w. Campbell's classic story "Who Goes There" was also the inspiration for the Howard Hawks/Christian Nyby version in 1950. Since Hawks/Nyby lacked the technology to portray Campbell's shape-shifting, assimilating creature, they focus on Campbell's theme of the "red scare". It's absolutely true communists occupied high positions in our government, including the CIA at the time Campbell wrote "Who Goes There". Hawks/Nyby focused on the camaraderie of the artic crew to represent "the American way of life," while making the creature a "walking vegetable," feeding on blood and preparing its occupation of the earth through asexual reproduction. Thus, the creature represented the "Communist menace" and the scientist a "fellow traveler. By 1955, the US government, through oppressive laws against communist in this nation, as well as the Hollywood Blacklist,had created a backlash against "McCarthyism". As a result, "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" presented the humans as communists and the "pod people" as the "fascist oppressors". Also, in 1955, the UK released "The Quatermass Experiment," AKA "The Creeping Unknown," which presented a creature that possessed the assimilation half of Campbell's "Thing". By the time of the unsuccessful release of John Carpenter's film, the "red scare" portion had been utterly discarded. However, the paranoic theme of "do you ever really 'know' somebody?" essence of Campbell's story remained. Even better, "movie magic" technology had made it possible to represent the creature as Campbell presented him: a communal shape-shifter capable of masking his actual identities, but capable of viciously revealing it true multiple natures when threatened or "hungry". Carpenter wisely retained most of Campbell's story. Especially effective is the scene where each of the Antarctic station's crew member is tested by having a hot wire submerged in his blood. It's a pity Carpenter didn't retain Campbell's ending, which was to discover that the creature was using equipment parts to build a communicator to alert his kind that the earth was ripe for invasion. Carpenter's ending is not as plausible, but it is certainly more exciting.The television version of the movie adds narrative exposition, providing the background of each character. I believe that was improvement over the initial movie release. After all, the characters start dying off so quickly, it's difficult to identify them, much less develop some empathy. Nonetheless, "John Carpenter's The Thing" is taut and terrifying, a genuine classic that did not deserve it's box office failure. Kurt Russell, Keith David, Richard Dysart, Wilford Brimley and the rest of the cast turn in fine performances. Ennio Morricone's terrific music perfectly complements the dark, moody cinematography and editing. The creature effects are outstanding and quite gruesome. Only the short animation sequence lacks plausibility."John Carpenter's The Thing" has finally become a bonafide classic, and that's a good thing (pardon the pun). I give it an "8".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply the best horror film ever, ending is exceptional cool.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie I really was wondering if this was the best movie I have ever seen (honestly). The movie's paranoiac atmosphere, caused by an unknown threat, works perfectly. Despite some clichs, the style of the movie is most original. Fortunately no one has tried to continue the story of The Thing - the original film is always the better one. Movie ends just like it is supposed to: the last two characters drinking alcohol and waiting for the blank future, surviving is unlike. I hate happy endings anyway. The only reason, why this is not the best movie on earth is the acting of Kurt Russel. Don't get me wrong, he is not bad, but someone else could have been better. Never the less this is easily the finest movie in which he has been acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Time hasn't really been nice to John Carpenter, nowadays obviously spending most of his time wondering how to destroy his las ounce of credibility as a director. Luckily for him, "The Thing" is a movie that will forever have him placed in the big league of horror masters among Lucio Fulci, Mario Bava, Wes Craven et.c."The Thing" is a actually a remake of an old movie from the fifties. Carpenter has cleverly captured the fear and mistrust at a polar station when people are infected with a highly dangerous, well, thing that make them turn into killers. Very gory effects will satisfy every horror-lover's desire, chilling atmosphere makes one always wonder what will happen next. Put shortly this is a classic horror movie that will entertain anyone who's not fainthearted.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carpenter's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An austere fantasy about a U.S. government research team stationed in the desolate Antarctic tundra, visited by an indestructible shape-shifting alien, John Carpenter's remake of Howard Hawks's The Thing from Another World methodically deconstruct the human psyche under stress while emphasizing the ineffectuality of solidarity when faced with a tactile existential crisis.The protean form of the eponymous 10,000 year-old extraterrestrial provides a strong ideological thrust as it assimilates the bodies of the crew at random, facilitating a convincingly febrile cocoon of paranoia, quarantine, and primitive self-preservation. Ostensibly an homage to '50s creature features, The Thing owes more to the social allegory of Romero's Dead Trilogy and the abstract techno/corporeal concerns of Cronenbergian cinema, which was coming into its own around the same time (1982). This would mark the third in a handful of starring roles for Kurt Russell in Carpenter-directed films. His portrayal of the vulnerable lone hero (the hero only inasmuch as he commands the subjective space) acting decidedly un-heroically?a staple for Carpenter, who seems to endeavor a refashioning of the Western in withered, technologically compromised dystopias?is effective and relatable.Carpenter makes masterful use of the Panavision format?often compressing the dozen or so supporting characters into the same frame?filling the space with ominous peripheral details, mounting the tension almost subliminally. Which is not to say that it is wholly reliant on silence and intimation for its impact. Rob Bottin's makeup work on the tirelessly regenerating alien has been The Thing's most enduring virtue, and not without reason: whether adding strange appendages to The Thing (the head of a victim emerging from a shoulder, attached to a long, spiraling neck) or having it suddenly burst through a carrier's tremulous visage, Bottin capitalizes on the concept of a mysterious, replicating evil in the most terrifyingly innovative ways.Not to be outdone, Ennio Morricone provides a repetitive, quietly harrowing score that sounds like the end of the world. And it is thus with The Thing, a vision of humanity scorned, burning itself bare at both ends, but in conception a work of paradoxical solidarity, craftsmen at the top of their game working toward a uniform purpose. Sometimes it's good to be at odds with the screenplay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thing explores trust and fear, and you find yourself wondering "what would I do?" throughout the movie. Good action scenes (for 1982) and Kurt Russell is a great hero as he uses the few tools (like a flamethrower) available to fight back. It keeps you interested with the plot, the twists (who are the good guys now?), and the scary parts build and then jump right out at you throughout the film. You're kept guessing even up to the end and after it's over. I remember renting this movie around 1983, when I was 22, and after it was over I thought about how spooky it was for a couple days. I recently rented the newer release DVD and found there to be fun commentary by director John Carpenter and Kurt Russell. Rent or buy it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated horror masterpiece. John Carpenter's finest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An alien theme plays as a helicopter flies across the South Pole landscape. Below it is a wolf dog, running through the snow. Apparently, the helicopter is chasing the dog. The pilot emerges with a gun and begins firing at the creature as it runs towards a base of American scientists.Soon, this doesn't sound as strange as it seems. Kurt Russell stars as the American scientist who learns the secret of the creature: it's over 100,000 years old, frozen beneath the ice, and p***ed off. We also learn that if it reaches civilization, within 27,000 hours the entire planet would be run by this creature - an alien lifeform that imitates whatever it kills. Dogs, spiders, grandma - this thing can do it. It's up to old Russell to save the day and destroy everything in sight in a blind rage.When first released in 1982, The Thing met with mixed critical acclaim - most of it bad. It was either 'not scary' or 'relies on special effects', but rarely would you find a positive review. Now, in the new millennium, the film is finally getting the recognition it deserves. The Thing has deservedly joined the ranks of the most famous horror films of all-time. It is even arguably more popular than it's basis, the 1951 sci-fi classic The Thing from Another World. First we'll cover the more commonly debated aspects of the film. One is the acting. I felt the acting was excellent, especially Russell as the determined chosen leader of the team. Moffat is the only other actor in the crew who is somewhat popular, but that has no affect whatsoever on the cast. The acting might actually give this film a documentary feeling to it...Carpenter is probably the movie's second most important aspect. His direction is eerie and suspenseful - this movie helped elevate him to his current position of horror/thriller wonder. If you truly look at this film, you can tell Carpenter wasn't trying to make it scary - he wanted to make it suspenseful, although there are a few jumpy moments in the film.There's also a fitting and chilling score by Ennio Morricone. It definitely doesn't rank among the master composer's greatest scores, but it works well on the mood of the film.The most important, and no doubt the greatest, aspect of the film is Rob Bottin's special effects. They are extraordinary. Every scene involving the alien parasite is completely convincing. Whether it's a gruesome alien bursting from a dog's body, or a severed head sprouting spider-like legs and walking around the room, the effects are outstanding. Bottin proves himself to be a make-up genius.It's no wonder The Thing is a classic. It's documentary-like feel and it's creepy atmosphere are perfect. Carpenter has succeeded in making a thrilling wonder that may even surpass it's aforementioned story source. No horror, sci-fi or thriller fan should go without at least taking a look at this masterpiece chiller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than horror, an interesting study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, it makes me shudder to say such cheesy things, but this movie is less a horror movie (sorry Carpenter) than a "study in fear." Phew, pretentious, I know, but it's the simplest way to describe it. By fear I mean the fear each of the characters is experiencing, not necessarily the audience's fear (although this *is* a scary movie). As in a lot of Carpenter's movies, the premise and tone is very Lovecraftian, which involves a lot of hinting at horrors past, and horrors to come.The story is adapted from a short narrative called Who Goes There? that was made into a movie by Hawks in the fifties (I have not been able to find a copy of Who Goes There? but Carpenter's version is supposedly more faithful to the original concept). The idea is that a creature has gotten into an arctic research station and is able to become any other organism there, whether dog, human, or something kinda between the two. That's all you need to know. We watch as the men at the station try to come to grips with their situation, controlling their fear while trying to decide which one of them is the creature, and most importantly, how to kill it so it doesn't reach civilization and conquer Earth. It's a light-hearted romp for both young and old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter's Finest Hour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the summer of 1982, audiences were presented with 2 very different types of alien movie. Whilst millions of moviegoers were won over by the warm, fuzzy antics of Steven Spielberg's E.T. on the other side of the fence was John Carpenter's The Thing, an altogether more vile and repulsive prospect. Needless to say, warm and fuzzy won out at the box office.22 years on and vile and repulsive have given way to revered and respected. Quite simply put, Carpenter's magnificent movie has stood the test of time well and is, in the opinion of many, (myself included), his finest film and considering the work of genius that is Halloween, which he directed 4 years earlier, is no mean feat. Sure, there are gorier films that have come out in the past 20 years, but few of them carry the same clout as seeing The Thing for the first time. When it first burst onto the scene, it was groundbreaking stuff. The effects were second to none. A dog's face splitting open; a human chest opening to reveal vicious, razor sharp teeth; a head sprouting legs and scurrying across the floor - just some of the surreal treats in store. If it had been made in the last decade, most of the effects would have been created with CGI, but the fact that everything you see is 'in the flesh' only adds to the jaw dropping astonishment of seeing these weird and wonderful creations.Bucket loads of gore alone, do not a great film make and fortunately The Thing has a number of great performances along with a great story to add to the mix of mayhem. Critics often complain that films lack any real characters and that there is no one to care about. Not so with The Thing. It may not seem obvious at first, but repeated viewings highlight the individual characteristics of the main players and in spite of the situation they are in, they behave in a credible manner throughout. There is a real sense that these men have been stationed at the base for a long time and that they have learned to tolerate each other even if they do not necessarily like each other.The underlying theme of the film is trust, or lack of. As the story progresses, it becomes uncertain as to who may, or may not be The Thing. It could be any of them, or it could be none of them. Tension rises and tempers fray as one by one, they each fall under suspicion. It's surely, no coincidence that Quentin Tarantino, who cites this as one of his favourite films, took the theme of trust and used it to great effect in his own film, Reservoir Dogs.There are so many great scenes in this film, it's difficult to pick one, but highlights must surely include: the defibrillator scene; the blood test scene and of course the infamous head stretching until it falls off the table and sprouts legs and runs away. Everyone has their favourite!The ending is satisfyingly ambiguous and has provided fans of the movie with plenty to debate. Spin off comics and even a hugely enjoyable console / PC game have helped to sustain interest in the film over the years.Rumours have persisted that a remake of The Thing will appear as a TV mini-series. Please, for the love of whichever deity you believe in, don't do it!!! If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Too many times a remake / re-imagining (whatever you want to call them) has tarnished the good name of a classic film.The DVD edition of The Thing is a true gem. Crammed with extras, the highlight is the commentary track with John Carpenter and Kurt Russell. It's informative and entertaining (as Carpenter's commentaries always are) and just listen to Russell roar with laughter during the aforementioned defibrillator scene. Priceless!As a side note, it has to be said that, generally speaking, people with beards in films, are not cool. In The Thing, Kurt Russell makes wearing a beard seem effortlessly cool!If you've never seen John Carpenter's The Thing, do yourself a favour and buy it / rent it, turn the lights off, take the phone off the hook and sit back and enjoy. I envy you, I wish I could watch it again for the first time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best horror/scifi film ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is based on the novella 'Who Goes There' that was beautifully written by John W. Campbell. (This movie has nothing to do with the 'The Thing from Another world', 1951 which was just cheap 1950's scifi movie-mill pulp fiction fair.) Although the story in Campbell's book took place around 1920, John Carpenters 'The Thing', 1982 is an updated version with modern settings. The characters in this movie are well thought out. They come across as very believable, unlike most of the Hollywood flicks these days. They don't say stupid things or have witty comebacks every three seconds. Nobody is cracking jokes in this film. Humor is just a cheap dialog trick by writers who aren't intelligent enough to say anything important. The characters in this film are much more true to life. This is the story about people at their best and worst, brought about by the most terrifying creature to grace the silver screen.The action sequences can be pretty graphic. Heck, lets not mince words. This film, uncut, probably has the most horrific scenes I have ever seen in a movie. Some people may not like it because of that. But it really does add to the story and is needed to show what the characters are going through. I probably wouldn't show this film to anyone under 15 or to my Grandma though. It's not for the timid. (Don't watch this film on public TV, they cut way too much out. Rent/buy the DVD.)I think those that complain of the slow spots in this film are just too used to the brainless action films of modern times (Chronicles of Riddick, T3, Matrix, ad infinitum). I like how the film slowly builds to a crescendo. It does have a few slow spots as it builds the storyline and expands the characters. But the slow spots are just setting you up for a triple whammy that will have you on the edge of your seat. It is just good suspense! It is the perfect mixture of talk and action that is rare in todays films.Whenever I see a horror/scifi film today this is the movie I compare it to. This film is the quintessential horror/scifi. This movie has it all: a monster that is really scary, good character development, great dialog, fantastic special effects that actually add to the story, and a plot that not only builds with time but is believable. See it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Horror Film of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can a film be so brilliant and so scary at the same time. All in the name of John Carpenter who couldn't put a foot wrong with his movies till the nineties turned up. Halloween, Assault on Precinct 13, Big Trouble in Little China, Escape from New York, Star Man, They Live, The Fog, Dark Star and Christine, the list is endless but his most claustrophobic classic horror film ever made. It brings a whole new meaning to the word horror and a whole new world of how a creature should look in a movie like this. John Carpenter was the most creative and inventive director of the 70's to the mid eighties. Now he is struggling to make a film to match up with his others but that's the way it is with directors. Carpenter spent so much time on doing things to his films back then his movies now look tired and old and to put it nicely `crap'. Looking back on The Thing it reminds you of his brilliance and how his films starring Kurt Russell were always a success and cult classics.The Thing must go down as the greatest horror film of all time because that is what it is whether you disagree or not. What we have to remember is that directors come and go and some stay for a while and Carpenter is definitely in the stay for a while category but how long that will last all depends on whether we ever see anything like what The Thing was and that's sheer brilliance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carpenter's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ill be the first to admit, I am not a big fan of the horror genre. However, an early memory of mine is sitting with my father watching "The Thing From Outer Space." Oddly enough, nearly twenty years later, watching it on TCM, it still scares the daylights out of me.However, John Carpenter, who admits to an influence of the original film also takes great care in preserving the original story set forth by "Who Goes There?" takes a much different route in the creation of his film. The result is a vision of harrowing emotional impact not seen in contemporary horror films of the past twenty years.The greatest factor in speaking of "John Carpenter's The Thing" is the claustrophobic feel of its environment. Being trapped in Antarctica is likely enough to drive anyone to madness, but introducing the idea of an elusive intruder furthers this concept. We the audience find ourselves freely engaging and interacting with the characters who are equally terrified of this new and frightening otherworldy force of nature. To see these people (not heroes or villains by any stretch of the imagination) deteriorate throughout the slow pace of the film, we experience a fear unlike that of any film that was released during this period. Instead of being affected by great special effects (to which this film can boast for its time), we are instead trapped inside the same research station as the characters, trapped and victim to our own machinations and fears of lonliness and desperation.This truly is John Carpenter's gift to film lovers and horror afficianados alike. Please watch, fear, and enjoy.*** 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carpenter is one of a king when it comes to movies, he does his thing here with some well done directing that really grabs to your back and hangs on, the silent scenes of the long halls only supported by gothic and mysterious music are definetely the best side of this movie, silence can scare.The movie follows a group stationed at a research facility in the antharctica (Spelled correctly? Probably not :), one day two men arrives in a helicopter apparently hunting a dog, they appear crazy and are shooting at the dog without thinking, after hitting one of the men of the facility they shoot the strangers. After going through the information gained from their corpses they travel to their camp and discovers it more or less ruin and burned out, returning to their home they put the strange dog into the kennel where it kills the other dogs and turns out as a monster, an investigation is set upon and the dead dog is investigated, it shows that the dog was controlled by an organism able to imitate other organisms to create a perfect copy, from here, the movie begins.Carpenter showed with Halloween already that his is one hell of a horror director, his strength is that he goes for psychological horror mixes only by a little gore, i hate the gore part of horror movies as it often appears un interesting and in the long run just plain boring, but Carpenter does this differently, he doesn't show to much of it, but still a little to disgust us, his unique style, that has however been copied a few times, is shown very pure here, with the many silent runs through the slim corridors, down creepy halls, with the classic horror music pumping through your vanes.The acting is pretty good, i wouldn't say that there are any of these that does a terrific job, i didn't feel that way at least, there are many main characters, which makes it a little confusing and also hard for one individual to stand out, even if Kurt Russell has the main part, they're all a bit above average but all fades a little to the background as there are so many different persons to focus at.Even though this is without a doubt one of the classic and memorable psychological terror movies, there is no doubt that it is flawed as well as beautiful, there are several loose ends and just generally things that i felt could have been explained better, in the start of the movie it paces very fast through the start of the movie, where i would have preferred a slower introduction that explained better what was really going on, but later on the story sums up rather nicely and does create a rather thrilling and entertaining movie.7/10</fullReview>

Halloween,Dark Star,The Fog,The Thing,Big Trouble in Little China,Escape From New York are all no-budget wonders and cult favorites. But The Thing remains his greatest achievement! Direction is flawless,the script wellwritten,acting great from everyone involved (Kurt Russel just isn`t the same actor when he isn`t working with Carpenter),the score is amazing (this is,after all,a Carpenter movie) and creature effects are simply breathtaking! The movie captures the feeling of paranoia and isolation like none before or since. What other 20+ years old movie features stuff that you see here?I could write about this movie or its director for 5 hours but the fans already know-this is one of 50 greatest movies of all time (and all time top 10 when it comes to horror) and it is shame that The Thing isnt on IMDB Top 250! What kind of world is this when movies like Amelie,Memento,The Pianist and Requiem for a Dream are all top 50 while this movie didnt make Top 250 list????? It just shows what most of us already know-peoples taste in movies is getting worse for every minute. For those who didnt like the movie - stick to romantic comedies and "based on a true story" crap dramas. For the fans of this movie - it deserves to be on the list and we have to do something to get it there! Thanks God for giving us different tastes!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't go into the plot of this movie because everyone before me has commented on it (and much better than me). Hopefully you already know something about it. My sister and I went to see this movie when it came debuted in 1982. We sat in the theater, the lights dimmed, and we sat there and got absolutely freaked out by the music. We left before anything happened and went next door to see "Bladerunner" instead. It took us two weeks to get up the courage to go BACK to the theater and try it again. We did and I was not disappointed. My sister, who is a little more sensitive than me, didn't like it and thought it was gross. I loved it, however and recently bought the DVD. I STILL love this movie. I must have a male gene in me somehwere because most women don't like these kinds of movies (nor the Three Stooges, which I also love). Perhaps it's because I grew up with an older brother who loved horror and scifi movies. Anyway, this remake is far superior to the original, but the original has a nostalgic quality I love too. Rent it today!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its taken twenty years plus, but this mini-masterpiece..no make that a full-blown masterpiece from Carpenter, is finally getting the credit it deserves.The one and possibly ONLY remake, that blows the original out of the water...and even that was a classic back in the 50's.Slated as being way too bloody and sickening in 1982, the film was completely overshadowed by ET and barely given a second thought....except by those who knew TOP sci-fi/horror when they saw it.What Carpenter adherent today would not recognise the phrase "You got to be fu....' kidding?" As identifiable as "Frankly Scarlett I really don't give a damn!" (No...I'm not equating those two films either!)As someone pointed out, the film gets by without humor, sex, females even, karate, awesome weaponry, CGI. Name another action/horror today can manage that? Made with intelligence and professionalism.How JC would wish he could return to those days!</fullReview>

In a good way of course.Now don't think that the only thing to this film is the gross out FX because that's not true we also get good performances from Russell and friends some good suspense and allot of honestly intense scenes.This is a masterpiece of gruesome visual horror one of carpenter's best films. So I say watch this movie if you want to be freaked out by insane craziness and are in the mood to stare wide eyed and open mouthed at the TV screen unable to utter words except "dear sweet mother of god" (ok I may be exaggerating slightly)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie really delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this movie around 1984.I was grown at the time and am glad they did not have stuff like this when I was a kid because at that time I had nightmares from The Cosmic Monsters and The Crawling Eye. I now own this on DVD and have watched it many times. My wife recently watched it with me having never before seen it. She absolutely will not watch it again and refuses to let me play it while she is in the oom. --------------POSSIBLE SPOILERS------------ This movie is a masterpiece for its genre. I especially appreciate several of it's "rarities". First, it's seriousness.No lame jokes and sarcasm that is so prevalent today. No super macho junk. Nobody fighting the monster with martial arts. Nobody telling their life's story. Nobody saying "fire in the hole", "he's mine", or any other too cool cliches of today. No woman "dressed to kill" hefting a shotgun or the latest bazooka. No distracting romance or flirting with the opposite sex. Example ,the movie "Speed". Sandra Bullock flirting with, laughing with, being coy with Keanu Reeves while driving a bus with a bomb underneath it. Give me a break!!! " The Thing" is a serious movie. It is believable. It is about 12 men facing a monstrous problem and nothing else. That is enough. Jokes , sarcasm, cliches, and any romance would have ruined it's hard edge. They would have made it infinitely less scary. It is a simple movie without distracting side storylines. This is really a one of a kind movie the likes which will probably never be seen again. I think ole John C. and Rob Bottin really were hell bent to top "Alien" and they did. To me they topped everything else too. Too bad JC did'nt wait a while for ET to go away to release it. Many people do not agree with me about the movie's merits and it does have it's faults but I hope I can one day see a more perfect horror movie than this. This is the movie that every SIFI and horror movie promised to be but this and only this delivered all the goods.And without a rubber suit, computers, and very little stop motion.(One scene with stop motion at the end got deleted before release--it is included on the dvd) Side note- I don't fully agree that it is all that bloody. Most of the red stuff comes from the alien when it "melts".Most of the gore is the alien creature when it changes shapes.Except for the "chest with teeth" scene there really are almost no scenes where humans are shown much bloodshed(Watch it again and you will see what I'm talking about). Even the guy who gets his head roped into the creatures "jawhead" only has creature red stuff on him and his head is melting when he gets lose. The people who have a problem with the dog's head splitting should realize that it is the alien dog, not a regular dog. Get real, people.This alien is SERIOUS and is an equal opportunity advocate. My favorite scene?? The begining, the end, and everything in between. As for the guy who said he did not see any actors he knew except Kirk Russel. How many TV shows and movies has he seen?? Buy the DVD and watch it every 2 years. It gets better with age.By the way, they needed the flame throwers to melt the snow, right?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is by far one of the greatest movies ever made. Every scene adds importantce to the story or characters. Each character is well-developed, acted and realistic. The story is about a group of men in the south pole researching when they come across a life form not from this planet. Soon paranioa and Fear kick in as the thing takes the form of the men. Kurt Russell is by far at his best in this movie. They should of win academy awards for it's effects and musical score. It's so creepy that I get goosebumps every time I hear it. Even people who are'nt fans of John Carpenter or Kurt Russell will love this movie. At the box office ET blew out The Thing and that is why this movie is so underrated just like John Carpenter's career. The ending alone will have you wondering for weeks and again each time you watch it.10 out of 10"Nobody trusts anybody, anymore..."</fullReview>

For one thing, Ennio Morricone's intense score sets the creepy tone, with chords that suggest a pulse or a heartbeat. Then the scene in which the men's blood is tested to see if any one of them had been infected by the Thing, that will shock you. Beneath it all is a study in paranoia. Who can you really trust?

		<fullReview>I don't like remakes at all, but the original of this film hasn't aged well and it almost put me off seeing Mr Carpenters version. I'm glad I did as this particular re-make is an extremely taut and exciting film which far out strips the (rather boring) original. As you can expect from Mr Carpenter there is the usual measure of gore but in this instance at least it never feels gratuitus and heightens the tension. The characters work in the film too - sure we know they're going to get picked off one by one, it is a horror film after all, but they appear more than the usual slasher fodder. A good film, very intelligent and probably my favourite John Carpenter film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The inhabitants of a scientific research station in Antarctica find themselves battling a alien creature capable of disguising itself as any other form of life in this taut and exciting remake of the 1951 sci-fi classic. I enjoyed the original film, but I feel John Carpenter managed to make a few improvements. I remember at the time of its initial release many people were highly critical of Carpenter's heavy use of gory special effects. However, by focusing on the special effects, the critics ignored a well-written script and some fine ensemble acting by a cast ably-headed up by Kurt Russell. This film, darker and more paranoid than the original, is one of the few films which deliver on the promise Carpenter exhibited with his low-budget shocker "Halloween." Sadly, for every "The Thing," there have been two "Ghosts of Mars."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Redemption for Carpenter - albeit briefly. WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all Carpenter's complaints later on his career about the studio system and the effect it had on his career, you cannot argue about the fact that one of his best, if not the best, of his career was made via Universal in 1982.Adapted more closely to John Campbell's book Who Goes There, Carpenter stuck far closer to the original source material in a way that the early Bond films were. The style of it is suggestive of a cross between ALIEN and INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (1978 version), underplayed at the start, implying in the middle and revealing at the end.The make-up and gore effects are perfect for this adaptation and Rob Bottin surpassed his work in THE HOWLING with some of the fx sequences in this movie. The casting is also notable, a mix of middle aged and elderly characters in spite of the fact that it is an all-male cast.The only criticism of the film is Ennio Morricone's montonous score, which doesn't have the impact that a Carpenter score would have.Still, it is a bonafide horror classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter at his very best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible spoilers.Immediately after the credits of this movie the opening shot is of mountains in the icy wasteland of the Antarctic, which seems to recall H.P Lovecraft's novella ?At The Mountains of Madness.' (Later Carpenter would direct In The Mouth Of Madness)The claustrophobic and paranoid atmosphere evoked in The Thing is nothing short of masterful. The special effects were awesome for the time and still stand up to the CGI effects of today. The film manages to transcend its genre because although the original story is hardcore science fiction the movie counter-balances with the right amount of action, horror, and drama. Ostensibly The Thing is a metaphor for the cold war but below the surface it is about human relationships. Who can you trust? The tag-line asks. There is a hallucinatory intensity to the movie that really kicks in when the paranoia of the characters starts (when Blair is asking Clark how long he was alone with the dog). It makes you feel like you're right in that camp with them. In sci-fi terms The Thing presents us with a monster that is truly alien (a formless thing that devours and replicates tissue, and NOT a critter of some description). It also shows us a monster that can give a presentation of normalcy, much like a smiling airline passenger who turns out to be a terrorist.This is John Carpenter's masterpiece and it is a classic movie. The understated score by Ennio Morricone is clinical and perfect, adding to the cold ambience of the picture. The ending is ambiguous but leaves room open for a sequel. It's a well-crafted movie that is entertaining and engaging from beginning to end.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Opinion, For What It's Worth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This picture is horrible. Just horrible. No touchy-feely messages or situations, no annoying "dark comedy" relief, no wall-to-wall, headache-causing audio-visual effects such as are found in most more recent monster flicks. Just enveloping, grinding tension and suspense, with paralyzing hostile-creature sequences. In short, it's everything a monster movie ought to be.Having grown up in the 50s and 60s and thoroughly enjoying the 1951 "Thing From Another World" and all the renowned monster pix of that time, I'll say now that this movie, for me, tops them all. I agree most heartily with many co-commentators that the atmosphere (right from the opening titles), special effects, characters and musical score are near matchless among sci fi-horror efforts. I've seen the movie easily over a dozen times, and to this very day I still tense up when anticipating certain scenes. Ennio Morricone's potent, steel-cold score, distributed through the picture with a master's perfection, compounds every gripping situation in the story-but then, what else should we expect from the man who gave us the famous "Clint Eastwood Theme Song" in "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly" (yeah, it was him!)? Also, the film is not ruined by stupid "politically corrected" character stereotyping, such as is seen in "Independence Day"; you can actually relate to these poor, besieged stiffs, which is really essential in achieving the suspense needed in any horror movie. I refuse to inject any spoilers- I'll only say that this John Carpenter thriller about Antarctic scientists thrown into a tense, deadly battle against a vicious alien intruder deserves a seat alongside "King Kong" (1933), "7th Voyage of Sinbad", "Alien" and very few others as one of the greatest monster movies of all time...that's my opinion, for what it's worth. My suggestion for viewing "The Thing" is: at night, alone, preferably in the wintertime, with a large screen and multiple speakers if available. If you're a connoisseur of chick-flicks or "E. T."-type movies, forget it.10/10 on this one, folks. God bless one and all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scared the hell out of me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years it seems that my tollerance to horror has lowered and i've noticed that i get scared a whole lot easier than i used to. I blame the excessive amount of splatter movies that i've seen as it has de-sensatised me from that particular genre but has increased my fear at the less noticable horror, namely psychological. The Thing is a splatter movie but it is also more than that. The splatter elements themselves only happen infrequently which leaves the rest of the film to build on the relentless tension and shear terror that the group of men feel as they don't know who the thing has infected. Setting the film in the Antarctic was a masterstroke as it creates a sense that there is no escape. I mean where are the men supposed to run to? This film also shows how computer animation has taken over from the great puppet work that used to be the norm. The effects in this are absolutely fantastic as everything looks so real. Also using the old rubber and latex technique makes the splatter look that more grotesque and gut wrenching (as opposed the CG gore that you find in films like Starship Troopers). This is also one of those films where you feel the terror that the characters feel also. As the decapitated head grows legs and runs across the floor you hear the line "You've gotta be f*****g kidding" from the character and the audience as a whole. John Capenter is a bizzare man as he has lost touch with his audience over recent years. Some of my favourite movies are his earlier works (this and Assult On Presinct 13 being nearer the top) but his newer stuff really is the lowest of the low (just look at Ghosts Of Mars). When watching his movies you either pitty him or remember that he used to be one of the greatest directors of all time. The latter thought is enough for me to still give him respect and repsect is what the man deserves as without him we wouldn't have Halloween or this masterpiece of cinematic horror. John Carpenter, i salute you. 5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boy did this one scare the pants off of me!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time when I was about seven years old and I don't think I slept a wink that night. Twenty years later, every time I watch this picture I feel like a seven year old again, and I don't scare easily. In fact, of the hundreds of horror films I have spent my life watching and dissecting, there are only a handful of films that truly terrified me, and John Carpenter's The Thing is at the very top of that elite list. But what is it that makes this movie so scary? The first element is the score. For some reason, JC's synth score really gets to me. I can't explain it but it really makes this movie seem extra creepy. In fact, I have the score on CD and even if I pop it in during the day, I can't help but get chills as it reminds me of a number of suspenseful scenes. Next is the special effects. Rob Bottin's work is absolutely amazing...hands down the best I have ever seen without the aid of computer generated graphics! The amazing thing is that the effects still hold up today against the CGI films. He really makes the monster come to life, a pure genius. Now, even though the score is eerie and the effects are off the charts, the real magic of this movie is the feeling of isolation and helplessness that Carpenter creates. Imagine, being trapped at an Antarctic research station with 11 other men, one or more of whom are "infected" with and alien monster and you can't contact the rest of the world. You can't tell by looking at each other as the monster imitates its victims permanently...until it gets you alone...finally revealing its true gruesome identity. But how do you know who are your friends...and who is "the thing?" This premise is what sets the tone for an edge-of-your seat game of: who do you trust and who do you fear? This movie is best enjoyed by yourself, during a thunderstom, with no lights on. Enjoy it, if you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Cool - SPOILERS-</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of John Carpenters best efforts and blows away any of his other films that I have seen. In this movie we are treated to some intense, for the time, special effects, and some of the best acting from Kurt Russell ever seen. This is a classic sci-fi/horror movie that takes the original, 1951 The Thing from Another World, to a totally new level. The original is somewhat tame, but really cool B&amp;W 50's monster movie stuff. John Carpenter took this concept and put a few twists around it. In the original a military outpost in the Arctic finds a spaceship complete with alien. They thaw it out and find out that it eats human blood and is part plant and part animal. In the new version, the setting is Antarctica, the group is civilian and the alien is found by a group of 'crazy swedes'. This alien is a little different as well, instead of eating human blood it 'eats' or replicates organic tissue. This makes it a mimic, able to replicate and consume any organism that it has contact with. This leads to suspicion, who is real and who is the thing?, and eventually to murder and complete destruction. My favorite line has to be when the group locks Kurt Russell's character McCready outside in the storm because they think he might be a thing and when he tries to get back in they say, "What if we are wrong? Well then we're wrong." The suspicion between the characters is sometimes palatable and I could feel the isolation and desperation from them.In the end, the whole camp is destroyed and only two characters are left alive, to slowly freeze to death. And we as the audience are left with the question, are they real or are they the thing? Well done, and one of my favorites. 9 out of 10 due to some poor intial dialog. Also has a great soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>what can i say? a gem in carpenters distinguished career. this is one of the most underrated films ever. perhaps its because it was so dark and gloomy that many people didn't see it? the haunting music and the isolation of the scientists certainly adds to the eerie feeling of the whole experience. i must say the alien is very interesting, not since alien (1979) itself have we met such an interesting and indeed deadly creature. it hides out among humans by imitating them. very novel! there are large amounts of death and gore in this film, so it shouldn't be seen by people with weak stomachs or reservations. its based on a book called 'who goes there' which was also the inspiration for the thing from beyond space, which is what this film is a - superior, in my opinion, which is a rarity, like oceans 11 - remake of. the effects in this film are good for a 1982 film, and very realistic as well, this is for me a triumph of cinema, and a truly great film. 10/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When John Carpenter Ruled As A Horror Director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to my view, "The Thing", despite it's flaws (most notably the lack of character depth), is one of the greatest sci-fi horror films ever made. In many ways, it's better than the other ground-breaking sci-fi horror film "Alien." I was jolted a lot more in "The Thing" than I was in "Alien"; the suspense sequences of "The Thing" are so intense at times, you can almost feel your blood vessels about to burst, your nerves about to be ripped from your body; only "Jurassic Park" did better. And I feel the astonishing make-up/animatronic effects of Rob Bottin is far superior to the rubber costume in "Alien." Only after "Aliens" was released was "The Thing" surpassed in animatronic effects.I am very disappointed that John Carpenter hasn't made a great horror film after this one. Along with "Halloween", he made some of the greatest horror masterpieces of the past twenty-five years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie tops horror movies up to today in story, effects, and suspense. It was ahead of its time then and it still is. The creature effects (Rob Bottin) were so cutting edge that you would think that it was made today, not 21 years ago.And since it was made in a time when getting top bill actors wasn't such a huge issue, they actors were perfect for their respective roles.The story was fantastic. No cheesy catch phrases, or lame lines that were to be played over and over in previews. Just normal dialogue among characters.The feeling this movie creates of isolation and suspicion is incredible. In movies today you have one big name who is the hero and one big name for the foe... this movie you really don't know who is going to be next... I've watched this movie dozens of times and I'm still caught off guard.This movie will remain in my top ten favorite films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thing is one of the best horror classics I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thing is the most intense and shocking horror films I've ever seen it has the most goriest scenes you will never have seen in any other horror films before.Some scenes are still even scarier today.The Thing is about a group of Arctic researchers who discover an alien has been buried underneath the ice for over 100,000 years.Soon unfrozen the shape-changing creature begins to imitate anything it comes into contact with.Spoiler - In the beginning we are introduced to Mac playing with the talking computer chess woman.Mac likes to drink and in this scene he is quite competitive but unfortunately he loses to the computer.Mac is not too pleased and destroys the computer's circuits with the drink along with the ice cubes. Kurt Russell as Macready is incredibly believable and excellent in his role as the boozing helicopter pilot. Macready isn't so keen on taking the lead but reluctantly assumes control of the group. Mac has accepted what's happened while the other guys are going nuts although he is terrified he is courageous as well. Mac is a realist when he thinks something has to be done he just does it and his prepared.Mac is someone we all want in situations like this.I also want to give credit to the actors Keith David,Richard Masur,Donald Moffat,Wilford Brimley,David Clennon,Thomas Waites,Chris Hallahan,and Richard Dysart etc were all excellent and believable as the men facing the terrifying situation.I liked the way the film developed seeing the 12 men portraying their fear and paranoia of each other and suspecting Mac could be "The Thing." Even though the film failed at the box office it's now gained recognition and a huge cult following among fans and it's well deservedI was only 2 years old when this film came out but I've seen it now and I've really grown to like this film with every viewing. I guess this film is shocking for the very first time you see it but its a great film and worth watching.The Thing is a serious film with very little comedy but there are some really great scenes, which made me laugh.The horror films now have changed so much that a look so unrealistic.The Thing is a classic and a sheer masterpiece and 20 years later it's still one of the best horror films ever made.</fullReview>

Effects that back in the eighties simply drew your breath still stand up in the days of CGI, isnt it amazing what you can do with Cow intestines! One of my favorite scenes has to be the blood test, where after testing everyone else and having Palmer revealed as a thing, Gary who is heavily under suspicion as being a thing loses his rag when he "Passes" his blood test, Also the comical effect of burning things exploding.

Oh of course, I saw the "original" Thing with James Arness but that was a joke...even funny !!! Even the re-make of the "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" wasn't scary...just intriguing!!

		<fullReview>*Some Spoilers*After watching "The Thing" I realized that it was very, very similar to Alien... with the exception of not being another overrated, often plodding Ridley Scott movie. Don't get me wrong, he is a good enough director, but Carpenter runs rings around him, and this movie goes to show that he can beat him with the same idea: a crew trapped in an area with a dangerous, shape-changing creature that is trying to kill them (the exception being that Carpenter adds more suspense and mystery by making his monster change into people, not just mutate into a hideous, alligator like creature on legs.) I like Alien a lot, but it is mostly due to the cast, which is excellent. The Thing has a cast that is also very good, but without as many familiar faces. The action sequences are better, and the violence/ gore is better as well. Obviously the focus of Alien was not gratuitous violence, but seeing people ripped apart by this ghastly creature was better than a little fake puppet jumping out of John Hurt's stomach and scurrying across a dinner table. The bleak atmosphere, lack of music (though there area few tunes here and there) and creepy noises make the ambiance better, for me anyway. Alien has a gross ship, but The Thing has desolate, arctic wasteland. It was more hopeless feeling to me. In terms of characters, The Thing is on par with Alien, even though the cast is less well known ( No big stars like Tom Skerrit, or Ian Holm). The only two actors I recognized were Kurt Russell and Keith David.... the rest of the cast is good though. The concept of paranoia also adds to this as well, with the crew killing each other... delightful. So, when its all said and done, I feel that The Thing is a stronger movie, and moreover Carpenter is (or was anyway) a better Director than Mr. Scott, whom I am growing less and less a fan of every day. My rating 5/5.</fullReview>

Antarctica, that is... A great ensemble picture led by Kurt Russel pits a scientific team against nature, each other and, of course the THING. Creative special effects stand the test of time, and as usual, Carpenter's score is fantastic. Too bad most of his horror movies since aren't nearly as good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite possibly, the finest movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all due respect to the original Star Wars (which is the greatest movie of all time), this is a spectacular movie, that long after you see it, you still find yourself wondering about details. This was the first DVD I bought, and recently, TNT showed this on TV. Curious to see how this was edited for TV, I tivo'd it and was quite surprised to see additional narration and scenes, lines of dialogue were added here and there, and there was an additional ending of maybe 20-30 seconds that showed the smoke from the ruined compound and a dog once again running across the snow. The characters were all introduced at the beginning by a narrator, which while interesting to me, seemed distracting.Why do I love this movie so much? For one thing, modern moviemakers could learn a thing or three from this, as the movie posits a number of questions that are open-ended. What happens in the end? Well, if you watch Contact, everything is explained to you, which ruins the movie really (why is there hours of static?) Why did they do this? Are we as an audience so jaded that we have to have every nuance explained to us?I've seen this movie many many times, and here are some thoughts:1) I'm still not sure how Mac's clothes get found ripped up here and there, but my feeling is that this is Blair's doing.2) How the team decends into paranoia is enthralling. I've rivited to the screen everytime. When the corpse moves in the supply room with Bennings in the background...I get chills everytime.3) The soundtrack...gotta love it, a true classic. Maybe 3 notes and it speaks volumes.4) My feeling is that Childs was paranoid, but saw Blair towards the end and ran out into the snow after him. Childs never caught up to him and got disoriented in the storm.5) Still not 100% on how Fuchs dies (burned up in the snow, but how?), but my feeling is this is Blair again.Best scene? I have several candidates, such as when Norris' stomach implodes, when the Norwegian frantically digs in the snow and the grenade goes off, or when Blair appears behind Garry, but I really love when they find Mac holding the dynamite and the flare.haven't seen it? you're in for a real treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When it comes to monster movies (i.e.: Alien, Predator) I'm usually very hard to scare, but when I saw 'The Thing' for the first time, I almost had to hide under a blanket (no joke!). Between all of the gore and jumps, anyone who isn't scared when watching this movie is not even close to being a coward.The plot circles around a group of scientists at a base in Antarctic who find out that they are in the midst of an alien invasion, after one of their dogs sort of freaks out. They figure out that the aliens 'hide' inside the humans and other living things, and each starts getting paranoid as to which one(s) of them may be a host.The result? An intense, suspenseful thrill-ride where you never lose your attention! Oh, and another gem that I can't not mention is the makeup. For a move made in 1982 the makeup is stunning, and much more realistic looking then most CGI these days.Great scary movie, 8/10.</fullReview>

This film exploits the "cabin-fever" horror plot, people stuck somewhere with something they don't like, I personally really like that kind of horror, add weird deformations you've struck gold.---possible spoilers---This film will sent the chills down your spine multiple times. An alien life-form has entered an American research station in the guise of a dog, which was being chased by clearly tired, frightened and slightly crazy Norwegians. When the dog turns into some weird deformed monster when put in with the other dogs MacReady (Kurt Russel) decides to head out to the Norwegian camp and find out what's going on, this is the big "finding out" scene and is scary, to say the least, without any gore I might ad. There they pretty much find out that what happened to the Norwegians is pretty much going to happen to them all over again. John Carpenter portrays human behavior pretty realisticly, especially Blair cracking down under the burden that is his knowledge of the creature is well done.I only have a couple of questions: -Where's the sequel? -Why the hell do people have flamethrowers on the North Pole?? :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Thing" and "An American Werewolf in London" demonstrate what you can do with some puppets, latex, fake fur, and red syrup. And I mean this in the most respectful way.Undoubtedly Carpenter's greatest accomplishment, "The Thing" is a different sort of horror movie. For one thing, there are no female roles...none, nada, zip. In fact, there really aren't even any "weak" male parts. There are no individually identifiable victims or threatened individuals. Instead there's a strange "socialism of terror" that comes out in teenage slasher movies and Twilight Zone episodes about the end of the world. It's also different in that the special effects DO (as stated in several other reviews) drive the plot. The crew of the station react to the terrifying (and often bloody) situations with a stunning combination of mystified disbelief, bravado, terror, and resignation.The beauty of this film, and where it differs from the earlier version, is that the threat to the crew is based in what is also their strength. Up until the very last frame of the film, the men must desperately rely upon each other for their safety and security. Yet the threat in their midst is so dangerous precisely because it preys on this need to trust others. The men are able to destroy the creature by various means, but only when they can identify it.I won't bore you further. See this film. The DVD version with the commentary and features on the making of the film is a "must-have".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Think about it, Alien, excellent film and the title doesnt call it 'a creature that ....', but tells u its an alien, which we learn next to nothing about it (with the odd exception), from this, John Carpenters 'The Thing' follows alien.******* SPOILERS WITHIN *********The plot is simple, and is based on a short story, and a 1950's film, Thing from another planet. An alien infiltrates a US artic base in the guise of a dog, this alien kills its victim and the Changes its form to that of its victim. This then leads the cast to suspect everyone, who can they trust. A series of deaths lead to the most suspenceful scene, when they all take a blood test. Like i said earlier, keeping it simple like the little knowledge of the alien (a name, where it came from and what it looks like in its true form) which leads creates a massive atmosphere filled with fear and paranoia which leaves you guessing until the very end.This is a film which you will return to watch for a long time to come, and the ending will leave you guessing all the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter's "remake" of the 1951 "The Thing From Another World" is much closer to Campbell's original short story "Who Goes There?" and a world apart in its special effects (courtesy of the great Rob Botin). Ennio Morricone's score adds to the dread atmosphere of the film. Upon its release, this film was unfairly maligned by most critics, but it has certainly gained in stature over the years and now is rated one of the top Horror/Sci-Fi movies of all time. The film is anchored by Kurt Russell's strong performance as MacCready, a member of an isolated scientific research party in the Antarctic. After a group of Scandinavians enter their base unexpectedly (trying to kill an extraordinary alien life-form posing as an Alaskan Husky) and are killed themselves in the process, the film becomes an elaborate guessing game in which no one knows who has been transformed into the mysterious and deviously inventive creature. One by one, each member of the base meets a terrifying end until the surprising conclusion (which leaves viewers hanging). "The Thing" is Carpenter's best work, although "The Fog" could be rated a close second. The performances by Russell, Keith David, Richard Dysart and the rest of the cast are all first-rate. Russell, in particular, stands out. "The Thing" was one of his first superior adult roles after a long career as a child actor in Hollywood and it boded well for his future career. If you missed "The Thing" when it came out over twenty years ago, rent the video. You won't be disappointed. You will be in for one scary night, however.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One day in the mid-eighties, I was paying a visit to a dear friend of mine, and his girlfriend. I discovered there were quite a few other people there already, and they told me they had rented this movie, apparently a horror-movie on VHS. So, I joined in the watching - totally unprepared for what was in store for me. I sat there, in their sofa, surrounded by lots of people but in spite of that the film so affected me and wrenched me away from reality that I had to steel myself not to reveal the HORROR that gripped my whole body! I felt totally alone, exposed to that extreme terror that was shown in this film.I have this 'condition', that when I see a truly good horror-movie, my body starts to tremble. And I mean tremble uncontrollably. It isn't that obvious and you can't really notice it if you aren't looking straight at me when it happens. But ooooh gawd, did this film make me tremble. The same happened when I, as a 14-year-old boy saw the first "Alien" film. This time though was absolutely the worst. And as I was trying to get a hold of myself, the film just progressed and got even scarier. Afterwards, I had to admit to being 100% scared out of my pants, even to my friends. We all were a bit shaken and had a hard time returning to this mundane world, as the thoughts of the film still haunted us.This is the Numero Uno of all the horror movies I've ever seen. And I've seen quite a few, as I'm 38 years of age when writing this.And the most important thing about this film is, that it's made long before the CGI graphics of today, and yet is even better than what they make today. Doesn't that say a lot about today's average horror-movie quality?11 out of 10.Dracopticon out. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On par with Hawks' original; Carpenter's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When people these days say, "Hey, did you ever see THE THING?" most people probably think they are referring to John Carpenter's brilliant re-adaptation (NOT remake) of the story "Who Goes There?", which was the basis for Howard Hawks' equally brilliant 1951 original. Both movies are triumphs of atmosphere, pacing and suspense, but the limitations set on filmmakers in the fifties forced Hawks' production to require much more of a reliance on suggestion and clever use of editing to bring its rarely seen monster to life. Carpenter, known even then for his ability to scare without resorting to the graphic violence and gore most horror movies offered up, finally gave in to Hollywood's embracement of gore and filled his movie to vomiting with some of the most disgusting imagery ever seen in a major studio release. However, unlike FRIDAY THE 13TH and other exploitation quickies, THE THING's effects were at least as frightening and nightmarish as they were gross, fit the intensity of the movie perfectly, and worked thematically to physically represent the decay and mutation that occurs within people when trust, friendship and security is destroyed. Both movies are rich in substance and style, and would make a killer double feature.</fullReview>

Morricone's eerie score sets the tone for the movie, and the opening sequence alone creates a more palpable sense of dread than any overblown CGI effect.*MINOR SPOILER*In this sequence, a lone husky dog is pursued by a helicopter across a lonely arctic waste. A man perched over the side of the helicopter is shooting at the husky, lobbing grenades at it, infact anything to kill it, and his increasing desperation tips us off that there's something not quite right with this scenario. Infact, the husky is a 'Thing'.*END OF SPOILER*Since the 'Thing' in question is an alien being that can mimic any creature it touches, this creates a problem for the motley collection of scientists marooned in the Arctic base (which provides the film's setting). First of all, since any single part of the 'Thing' is sentient in itself, it's very difficult to kill it. Secondly, the 'Thing' could be one of them.In the main role, Kurt Russell creates the same type of cool-as-ice persona as Snake Plisskin in 'Escape From New York,' but the supporting cast are equally effective. Infact, since the 'Thing' isn't actually seen for much of the movie, the film builds up tension through the increasing sense of paranoia and distrust between the characters. This Hitchcockian element, often overlooked, is a key ingredient to the film's effectiveness.When the 'Thing' does appear, however, it's certainly memorable. In one scene, a dog's head opens up like a banana, in another, a human head peels off at the neck, grows legs and stalk-eyes, and scuttles along the floor like a crab. The response of one character, appropriately, is "you gotta be f***ing kidding!" But it's the moments between these gruesome episodes that truly justify the film's greatness, and the unusually downbeat ending is a worthy payoff. A great flick, which chills as much as shocks.4 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Strange Disappearance of John Carpenter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What happened to John Carpenter?The man is clearly MIA, because The Thing is one of the best horror films ever made. Great evocation of paranoia -- the real star of this film. Russell and the rest of the actors are letter-perfect. If ensemble acting this good was present in a drama, the actors would be nominated for awards. Horror films get no respect.It would be a delight to see the re-emergence of The Master. Danny Boyle has upped the ante considerably with 28 Days Later. If Carpenter decides to take his genre seriously again, he's got some serious competition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Carpenter's best thrillers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**definite spoilers**Next to "Halloween," "The Thing" is perhaps John Carpenter's best film. Although it was a critical and commercial flop when first released, it has since gained its own cult following--not as large as the former, but large enough to convince horror fans to reevaluate it. Set near the South Pole, the film concerns a deadly space creature that infiltrates a scientific outpost. This being can absorb any living organism and duplicate its characteristics with chilling precision. If left unchecked, it may wipe out the human race. After a good twenty years, it still holds up for the most part. It is a simply-plotted but well-crafted effort, generating an eerie, desolate atmosphere, not unlike that of Ridley Scott's influential "Alien." Filmed in Alaska, the bleak cinematography makes it seem like it really was filmed in Antarctica. There is an acute feeling of isolation, the sense that we are thousands of miles away from any other human being. It is just them...and it."The Thing" is a more explicitly violent film than "Halloween," but delivers just as much in terms of good, honest shocks. There are moments that still compel the viewer to jump, moments that are genuinely creepy. The special effects work used to bring the alien to life are still very good--nice and gooey, and the fact that the creature makes its presence known when we least expect it only adds to the terror. Inevitably, it attempts to infiltrate this unfortunate group of people. The screenplay cleverly second-guesses the audience's attempts to devise the identity of the creature. Just when we think we've guessed who it is, the film surprises us. The paranoia and claustrophobia is nearly unbearable at times. The creepy music adds more to the atmosphere.In some ways, this is arguably a better film than "Halloween;" Carpenter's pacing is more assured, and the shocks more intense. Yet, the characterizations prove to be the film's major weakness. Aside from Kurt Russell, most of the characters tend to be fairly interchangeable, unfortunately hampering the effectiveness of the material to some degree. It's still a well-made thriller that is obligory viewing for genre fans. I will not compare it to the 1951 original, unseen by myself. The remake is good enough to stand on its own merits, and many have argued that it is actually a superior film. Whatever its flaws, it delivers.*** (out of ****)Released by Universal Pictures</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Paranoia Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-This is an excellent example of quality horror cinema. Despite it's slightly cheesy title (although very appropriate), it is a truly amazing piece of work. It builds an eerie mood of isolation from society, creates believable characters with plausible relationships, and generates just enough gore to keep you near sickness, but not pushing the envelope. The gore is really a subtle fraction of the disturbance factor of the film. The real suspense/fear comes from not knowing who is human and who is an alien "Thing." This paranoid feeling added to the remoteness keeps this film terrifying even twenty years later. Although the graphics are somewhat dated, I find them more frightening then some of the available computer let downs of the late 90s and early new century (pitch black). When did Toy story become scary? I really like Kurt Russell in this film also. He creates this kind of "bad-boy" hero persona into his character that really makes you like him. The ending is also one of my favorite moving endings. Does it matter if the other guy is a "Thing" or not? This movie is a gripping, chilling, masterpiece, and I think contemporary horror film makers should all pay homage it.</fullReview>

The special effects still make me squirm, and the script is as it should be - Simple, and Effective.This Film is pretty bleak, but as in Life, the only true certainty is death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carpenter's Genius on Celluloid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's "The Thing" is a fantastic sci-fi/horror film with an interesting story and good special effects (for 1982). Carpenter turns what would've been a lesser film in the hands of another(except possibly the great Quentin Tarantino)into a slam packed film in which the suspense is great and the various revelations pose more questions than answers. Kurt Russell oozes cool as helicoper pilot MacReady who only wants to get out of Anarctica and go home. The plot is one of my favorite aspects of the film: a remote Antarctic research station is infiltrated by a creature that is thousands of years old and can assimilate any body and become a carbon copy. Paranoia and fear run rampant as the residents try to discover which one of them isn't who they claim to be. The writing can get corny at times but the script hold tight enough. Carpenter's direction in the horror genre is untouchable and this film is a glaring example of why. Upon first viewing it instantly became a favorite of mine, and I hate horror.Should tell you something about the quality, kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who says remakes are never better than sequels?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's "The Thing" is an absolute masterpiece. This film is flawless in nearly every aspect, and really proves how talented John Carpenter is as a filmmaker. From Dean Cundey's stark lighting to Ennio Morricone's solid minimalist score, this film reeks of greatness. A true compliment to pay the film though, is how John Carpenter is able to take the large cast and make each character unique and interesting. It could have become confusing in the wrong hands, but John Carpenter is able to balance character development in with the plotting seamlessly.Although all the actors are excellent, the real star of the show is Rob Bottin's ground breaking special effects. As I write this in 2003, his effects work in "The Thing" have yet to be beat. Simply amazing gore work is featured throughout the film that is so gruesome and shocking it will have even the toughest of viewers turning their heads.With all the gore featured throughout the movie, it is amazing how Carpenter is still able to generate suspense by stressing the unseen. He is not merely making a gore picture, he cares about scaring the audience. Some scares come from the gore, but most of them come from the build up to that gory moment. The long tracking shots inside the claustrophobic station are particularily effective.The icing on the cake with "The Thing" is Carpenter's perfect apocalyptic ending. This is a dark film, and the ending does not cop out with some sappy rescue scene. The ending is true to the themes and characters of the film, and is one of the best in history. The last line of the film beats "watch the skies" from the original "The Thing". In fact, everything about this film upstages the original. This is a remake like only John Carpenter can make, and it is a rollercoaster ride from start to finish. One of the best science fiction films ever made, bar none.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was actually impressed with THE THING. Earlier when studying movies, I watched HALLOWEEN and CHRISTINE, and heard about THE FOG, but THE THING took awhile to intrigue me until I heard they were making a video game out of a twenty year old movie! I am happy to say that THE THING is an exceptional horror movie, with excellent effects and a good pace. A breath of fresh air from the everyday horror garbage of today THE THING excels at keeping you in with the movie.Set in Antarctica, a team of Norwegians get themselves killed while trying to shoot down a dog. An American group take in the dog while they also investigate the Norwegian camp, trying to figure out why they went nuts.Tough luck this movie was released two weeks after E.T. Anyhow the "who is it?" part to the movie is just as engaging as the horror of 'the thing' itself. It is too bad the movie just went on for so long to keep it from being perfect. Excellent special effects by Bottin. The movie holds itself up well today, despite a few areas of improvement. Two thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My attention was brought to this film, by the game that was released earlier this year, as in a review of the game (also named The Thing) it said the game picked up where the film left off. So after playing the game (which I enjoyed) I asked for the film on DVD for Christmas. So, two days ago, I received it. And last night I watched it.It was very good. I really enjoyed it, sadly, however, my knowledge of the game meant that I already knew what it was about and what happened in the end. But apart from that.Special note to the start. Very spooky, eerie opening. Just 4 sounds for about 4 minutes. The sounds of: the helicopter, the gun, the running dog and the "Boom Boom Boom" of the music, really sets the tone for the rest of the film. Up there with my favourite openings to films (including Apocalypse Now).A very nice, slow starting 30 minutes. Just showing the characters, and the quiet threat that the huskie represented. Then, from there, apart from a few short 5 min gaps. It's all gore, which is what we expect from the man who made Halloween.What else, the setting, good choice. The vast, snowy wastes of antarctica. I think that had this film been made today, it would have been set in a city, which would have been a mistake. As setting it in Antarctica meant two things. 1: The Thing had nowhere to hide. 2: The men had nowhere to run. Meaning it had to be destroyed. It also allowed for some very nice long shots of the buildings and vehicles contrasting against the nice, white snow.Some chillingly realistic FX in this. *SPOILER* When the things head comes off, watching the neck stretch and tear did make my stomach turn. *END SPOILER* This film is now among two (alongside 2001) that have made me realise that computer-generated monsters and props aren't always needed to make something believable.And finally, a horror film without a woman to hold it up. No offense to the ladies out there. But when a female is in a horror film, it's usually for a love interest, which means scenes that stop the pace of the whole picture, removing your interest and making you impatient. Nice then, that this was a welcome relief from the old clich.The ending was good, *SPOILER* A nice little exchange of dialogue showing that (in my opinion anyway) how they could be things and not know it, that the thing was maybe biding it's time, remaining dormant inside of them.*END SPOILER* Disagree if you want. Still a very good film that I would even recommend to random people in the street.9/10</fullReview>

It had excellent special effects created by Rob Bottin (creature designer for "deep rising", "the Howling", and many more movies....) the monsters were some of the best designs ever created for a horror movie. The movie is about a group of people out in the middle of Antartica when they discover a slimey, shape-shifting creature that starts to kill and morph into the ever decreasing cast. All-star cast, superior monster effects, plenty of gore and action, suspence and paranoia make this the best movie ever made!!!!!!!

		<fullReview>old movies bring back memories, let's face it. it's not the quality of the story line, acting, music score or cinema photography that necessarily draws us back in, it's instead what the film represents in terms of remembering where we were, who we were with and what we were doing in our life at the time of the films original release.I watched this movie again the other night, 20 years after I saw it in the theater. In 1982 it scared the hell out of me and I felt it was one of the most suspenseful films I had ever seen (to that point). Re-watching it, this time with my 16 year old, I found it somewhat hokey, and my daughter's laughter (at the gruesome parts) reconfirmed what I already knew: what scared people in '82 is not what keeps them on the edge of their seats in '02. Our kids are used to a world of realism (a.k.a. terrorists) and mutating organisms just don't hold them spellbound.Still, I really like this movie, even after all this time has elapsed. In an age where most special effects are 100% computer generated, I found this film's most gruesome scenes original and refreshing (for they were 'state of the art' back then). At the risk of dating myself (I've already done that!) I have to say that I'm more drawn to this genre of film circa early 80's style, than I am to most of the content that comes from Hollywood today. I also love the character development on display here. It's great stuff.I never saw the 1950's version of this flik. I was plenty satisfied with this one.</fullReview>

The monsters seem to come out of some other movies like Alien but it wasn't the same thing. The only thing that the movie could have done better was the performance of Russell, I don't think he is a bad actor, I just thought that the character that he portrait did have a resemblance to the character that he played on ?Escape From New York and L.A.' and so on, but that was the only fault that I found.

		<shortDescription>2 versions of this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a little known alternate version of this film, sometimes shown on cable television. The alternate version features a narration at the beginning of the film, giving an ominous warning about what may be out there. Then, as we see the characters for the first time, there is a brief narrative, covering a bit of the character's background, and the reason as to why they are in the Antarctic, on this research base in the first place. The end of the movie also features another chilling narrative, warning that a being like the 'Thing' is not necessarily a far-fetched concept. This alternate version is used to fill time and censor some dialog, most likely to make up for the time that has to be cut for cable viewing.This is a very chilling and frightening movie...the gore is a bit over the top, however. If you see this movie for the first time, you'll probably end up getting sick to your stomach. It usually takes the average person one or two sittings of the movie to become adjusted to level of gore. Otherwise, this is one of Carpenter's best flicks, and Kurt Russell gives a great performance, supported by the talented Keith David. Definitely a must-see for any horror movie fanatic or Kurt Russell/Carpenter fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>More a mystery/thriller than a horror The Thing is packed with special effects, which were probably some of the greatest at the time. Tame by today's standards, The Thing will only get to the weak of stomach and the unsuspecting. The Thing has many moments where the viewer can literally not move, it will have you in such suspense and awe that your eyes will be locked onto the screen until the scene is done.The Thing takes place in Antarctica mainly in a U.S. Research Base, what they are researching in the middle of nowhere on a block of ice in 1982 is a complete mystery. We know this movie is about an alien when we see a spaceship crashland on Earth. Soon after this a helicopter from Norway is opening fire on an Alaskan husky, it doesn't take much thinking to know this is the alien. The chopper doesn't shoot it and lands in front of the research base, unfortunately the gunman can't speak English and accidentally shots one of the workers in the arm, thinking that he is hostile the leader of the base shoots him in the eye, and this is where the mystery begins. The men travel to the Norweigan base which is completely destroyed and contains odd looking corpses which have been warped and mangled, lucky for them they bring them over their base. The Thing can be based up on a few things ; flamethrowers, tentacles, the ice, and the blood test scene.The ultimate ending is rather anti-climatic. Everyone thinks something will happen at the very end of the movie, then the credits roll. The one is missable, if your weak of stomach watch it, it might desenseitize you, if you are totally unable to see horror and laugh at mutilation scenes like me, don't watch this one, you can miss it. If you have ever played Resident Evil 2 for PSX, you'll know exactly what this movie is, and won't feel a thing towards the monsters. This movie is very overrated by tons of people today, The Thing by no means works on the 2000 level, but sure did scare people 20 years ago. One last thing, don't let the cover fool you, nobody in this movie goes underwater even though the box of the movie looks the exact same as The Abyss, a much better movie by the way.</fullReview>

For those of you who haven't seen it yet, be prepared for some of the most beautiful special effects, grotesque, but beautiful. Too many movies have lousy computer effects which ruin them.

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter's masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter reinterprets the 1951 film "The Thing from Another World", hewing more closely to the John Campbell story the movies were based on, and strikes gold. Admittedly, the FX are not the greatest by modern standards, 1982 predated common use of CGI to show us what an alien monster is "supposed" to look like, and the movie may overdo the visuals a little, but Carpenter IS a horror director after all and we pay to see the gore and slime, don't we?While the story of otherworldly threats to man, particularly those that hide inside people, like Alien, is always good for visceral creep, what really makes The Thing shine is its use and portrayal of psychological fear. Carpenter already has a solid grasp of the tools of the trade, with the creepy Ennio Morricone theme, the frozen, dark wasteland setting outside and the claustrophobic shacks inside, the questions and guesswork he leaves you with to guess at what happened that he didn't show, and has a solid cast including Kurt Russell, Keith David, Richard Masur, Richard Dysart, Donald Moffat, Wilford Brimley to work with. But the real effect of this movie is in its portrayal of all too real human fears under such circumstances. The isolation of being stuck on a continent that's a frozen wasteland with only a few people for months, 1000 miles away from aid, an inhospitable and deadly environment outside that forces people into close confines, the manifestations of anxiety, paranoia, cabin fever and how all the characters react differently to it make this movie very accessible and believable. Carpenter could have completely deleted the alien altogether and this would still be an effective scary story about people forced together in an isolated and inhospitable place who begin to turn on each other, something that can and does happen to people in such circumstances.Kurt Russell does excellently as the macho, practical, "let's find this sucker and get it" protagonist, as does Keith David, whose skeptical, and sees the other men, Russell in particular, as as much of a threat as the alien, Wilford Brimley as the scientist who recognizes the threat before anyone else and is intent on stopping it before it can get out, everyone else be damned.This is Carpenter's best work to date.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>JOHN CARPENTER'S The Thing is my favorite movie ever. Hands down. John Carpenter's usually awesome direction is present and Kurt Russell delivers such a strong performance as MacReady, you almost assume the character is REAL. Many people have claimed the film is too heavy on effects and the storyline is totally absurd (if an intruder took over your body and soul, what would it matter?? You would practically be the same person...) I don't know about you, but me and MacReady want our individuality. It's a movie, folks...Movies are meant to entertain. And that is exactly what The Thing does. Fabulous fast-paced script by Bill Lancaster and outstanding performances all-around, especially from Russell, Clennon, and Brimley. The film professionally features suspense, horror, and even bits of humor (Russell's macho attitude features humor in it all-around) in it, showing us all that the filmmakers and actors were indeed all well-trained. Rob Bottin deserves a special award for his breathtaking effects and Ennio Morricone's score is absolutely eerie (overtones of Carpenter's scores are heard here, or i believe Carpenter uses overtones of Morricone). Overall, the film is a perfect 10 and you need to watch it on DVD. And remember: Man is the Warmest Place to Hide...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine a monster that could absorb and replicate you entirely, not just your organic form but your mind as well. It can reproduce your behaviour so perfectly that your friends won't know the difference. Now, imagine that this particular monster has been around the universe for a time unknown. It's sole purpose is to survive, and for that it has absorbed beings from all over, hiding and attacking when threatened. Not only is it able to absorb living creatures, it is able to morph into all of them, or mix them together to become as deadly as it possibly can.Now, remember that this monster doesn't just absorb the body, it also absorbs the mind of it's victim. By doing that, it is a growing mixture of different psychologies, with their instabilities, their fears, their hatred. So, it's not just a physical monster, but an insane one as well.John Carpenter's The Thing is a fantastic movie, where horror and insanity walk hand in hand in a tragic descent into hell. Twenty years after it's making, it still stands out of the crowd as one of the freakiest horror movies ever made. Surprisingly, the old fashioned visual effects benefit the film, by giving it a different kind of realism that we're just not used to see anymore. Not a computer generated well trimmed look, but a crude and visceral style that really gets in your head.Undeniably, still crazy after all these years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserves a 10 out of 10. Here's why.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a storyline that still leaves audiences asking questions, THE THING was undeniably one of the landmark horror films of the 20th century. John Carpenter's expert cinematography ensured a realism and suspense that has created a lasting impression even by today's standards.THE THING is set over a six day period where a group of isolated US scientists are attacked by an alien life form at an Artic research station called OutPost #31.From the husky's entrance at the beginning, right up until it's climatic ending, THE THING's screenplay fabulously depicts a traumatic realism which has been signature to the films lasting reputation. The story unfolds when the characters suspect that any one of them could be infected by the alien. Their fears are realised when one by one each of the team members falls victim to THE THING leaving the last remaining members to fend for themselves. Besides the outstanding acting and special effects, John Carpenters build of mystery, anxiety and panic uniquely portrays a psychological confrontation rather it does as a typical horror.Essentially however, it is a survival film. Arguably, it was the first film of its kind to incorporate horror and a 'who dunnit' theme reminiscent of genres found in murder/mystery films. Critics have therefore failed to give appraisal to THE THING for unwillingly appreciate the intricate detail that was involved in the story line. Who was the shadow on the wall? Who was first infected? What happened to the whiskey bottle? Who stole the keys? What went on in the Norwegian camp? Forget who shot JFK, who survived THE THING?This film deserves a 10 out of 10 in every respect. Any film which has sparked as much critiquing as THE THING has surly earned itself to be titled as a movie masterpiece. Rumour of a much awaited sequel has revived the film's popularity in the 2000's. But until then, fans will have to do with the DVD release and the captivating new computer game.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favourite S.F. movie. I like to be very precise with the genre because (for me)this is PURE S.F.. Not only for because it is tract by the Campbell's novel, but also for the cut that Carpenter give it. Few movie have its balance between terror and amazing for the unknow, between suspence and beautiful(and also mechanic)special effect! I think this is one of the best example of the Carpenter's talent, and I'm almost sure that he also think to the genius of H.P.Lovecraft for the structure of the storyboard. The end of the movie is very enigmatic and elegance (no good end), with obscure politically reference(like more of Carpenter's movie). Enjoy for all the S.F. fan who doesn't see it.

		<fullReview> I think this film is a remake of a 1950's classic, but can't find the relevant reference.  As it is, John Carpenter turns in a masterful effort of chilling, riveting cinema, that still roots me to my seat after countless viewings. He even does the soundtrack which ably compliments the feeling of claustraphobia the Antartic Survey team feel at finding an intruder amongst their midst..

		<fullReview>I frist saw this movie when it came out in 1982. I really liked it and still do, even thought some story aspects were cut out which made it seem disjointed in many spots. And some people have asked how much of the score is Morricone and how much is Carpenter. THE WHOLE SCORE IS BY MORRICONE, as Carpenter has admitted that Morricone is one of his musical influences. Also Carpenter didn't have any time to do the score. So the electronic music is by the Maestro, and no one else, so Morricone is doing what Carpenter has been doing all his musical career. Ironic, isn't it? Also Carpenter did not use one of the best musical cues that is included on the CD: BEASTIALTY. This sinisterly comic cue was to be used over the dog kennel scenes where the Thing is taking over the dogs.*****SPOILER*****My one complaint is when MacReady blows up The thing. Hunh? Doesn't he realize he's only creating more, tiny things? Torch the sucker, Mac, torch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MASTERPIECE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film looked awful when first released, believe it or not. I think it was DOA at the box office. My, how the years have changed things. Today this movie is clearly a masterpiece. It simply must have been ahead of its time. Like BLADE RUNNER, which admittedly hss its faults but looks better and better as the years roll by. It is a very different take from the original, which essentially was Frankenstein updated to the Cold War. The Carpenter version follows the classic short story much more closely. It begs the question of who is real and who is not, a sort of variant on INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS. The claustrophobic sets are terrific, the scares are real and plentiful, and the gore is amazing. Having the wonderful Kurt Russell as the star plays its part, too. Wait until you see the caged dogs sequence. Carpenter definitely was a man with a vision, even if his last few efforts have fallen off in quality. There is talk of a seqel, and I can only hope it does not bring back Russell or Carpenter. The movie is perfect as it is, and a sequel using the original director or star would certainly be an abomination. Better to put a younger or different director to work on it (Chuck Russell comes to mind, among other) and repeat the plot with the cast of THE FACULTY. No joke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film Thrills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this film about 3 times since I first viewed it at a drive-in back in 1982. Although I don't find The Thing to be as scary as many who have provided their reviews here, the film is an excellent sci-fi thriller. If you want scary, rent the original Psycho by Hitchcock. Carpenter made his masterpiece with this movie. All the other films he has done have disappointed me on some level, but not this one. The Thing has just the right amount of humour mixed with intensity that I prefer and enjoy. Carpenter's other films usually have a campy quality that is hard to sit through. The Thing has a few holes in the idea that could have been clarified a little more. **Possible Spoilers** For instance, when the Thing imitates a human does the person's memory and personality become altered or obliterated. None of the characters ever brought this up which kind of boggled my mind. Also the proliferation of dynamite and flame throwers at the camp was a bit much. It looks like they were geared up for some kind of alien invasion (maybe Saddam of the South). All in all though, this is a great film which I give a rating of 10 to because of the great direction, music and special effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THIS IS NOT AN "UPDATE OR A REMAKE" OF "THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD". It is an adaptation of "Who Goes There?" a John W. Campbell short story. While I do enjoy the film(The Thing From Another World, that is), it is in almost NO way an adaptation of that story. The only similarity being the alien discovered in ice. If this is enough then "Encino Man" is as much an adaptation. I keep hearing people say that is an update over and over again. Anyone who has read this story knows that "The Thing" is almost word for word to the book. The story is about a shape-changing alien not a vegetable for godssake. Both movies are great but enough already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Horror Movies Ever Made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truly a great horror film, there's never been one like it before or since. Kurt Russell gives his best performance ever in this horror movie set in Antarctica. The movie's pace is non-stop, and all of the scenes ring true. The special effects are still great more than twenty years later. What makes the monster truly frightening is that it isn't good or evil, or right or wrong, but that it destroys to survive, and that its path of destruction is unstoppable. This is one of the few movies where the term "Lovecraftian" can really be used. The monster is from somewhere else, and is not a conventional anthropomorphic creature with corny dialogue. Very original, if only Hollywood would make more horror films like this! 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this movie recently with very low expectations, having only read negative reviews of it. Well, I really can't see where any of that negativity comes from. The movie is exceptionally well done. John Carpenter has topped the rather dull 1950's version and created a horror masterpiece.The secret to the film's success is not only the special effects (which are very impressive) or the performances (Kurt Russell and Keith David are standouts), but the general air of paranoia throughout the film. The men don't know who the Thing is, and neither do we. The scene where Russell ties his "friends" to chairs and tests their blood against a hot needle is absolutely terrifying. Understand, when this movie was made the Cold War was technically over, but everyone was still a bit on edge. I feel this scene perfectly represents the rather militant tactics Americans had used to route out communists.Of course, the main intention of the film is not to make commentary on the state of the worlds politics. Its intention is to frighten, and that's what it does. The effects are wonderfully gory and very well done, some of the best produced in the eighties.Overall, I highly reccommend this to anyone who wants to have a good scare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably one of the most underrated films in the sci-fi world. I am still blown away by this movie. This review is for the Collector's Edition DVD.To me, how a DVD is constructed is as important as the content itself. Unlike most DVDs that force you to sit through warnings that noone reads and studio logos that nobody cares about, this DVD gets it right. You drop the DVD in your player and it plays the movie just like you would see it in the theater. Studio logo followed by opening credits.I absolutely love the opening sequence of music and credits followed by the helicopter chasing the dog. You are instantly thrust into the madness caused by the alien intruder and the ride continues until the movie ends. It is never boring, yet doesn't rush the storyline and dialog like so much of Hollywood drek these days.I recently saw Alien and thought about the similarities to The Thing. In the end, I have to say The Thing may be a better movie for one reason - it is closer to home - i.e. planet Earth. Each movie rates in my top ten, but I have to put The Thing one notch higher than Alien.The extras on the CD are a mixed bag. The interviews with cast and crew are quite good, with a fully produced sequence, including clever variances of the title sequence. The commentary over the movie is only for the most hard-core fans, since you have to sit through the entire movie listening the John Carpenter and Kurt Russell chat.In summary, watch this movie. It is a classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a classic science fiction thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a science fiction thriller fan, I consider the alien and predator series to be the best movies I have seen. I have added The Thing to my best movies list after recently watching it. It is about a shapeshifting creature from space that terrorizes an outpost crew, both physically and psychologically. As the capabilities of the Thing's abilities are known to the crew, they all begin to suspect each other of being infected. The Thing does not just involve a monster that kills people. It also involves paranoia, and if you give it a second watch, you'll find that there's more depth to it than you could possibly imagine. A lot of scenes are left to you to decide what happened, mostly you will asking yourself when a crew member was infected and by which form of The Thing. There is a lot of gore in this movie, though some of the blood definetly looked like ketchup. Rob Bottin's fantastic work on the thing will make many cringe when they look at it. This movie is 90 minutes long, but the content could more than easily have been expanded to 110 minutes and that is my only complaint. Other than that, The Thing is an excellent science fiction thriller that is a must watch for any science fiction fan.</fullReview>

The only scene I wish would be updated is the primordial computer graphic scene showing the Thing multiplying to take over the world in x number of days(1981 PC technology is a give-away) There being no females in the camp has saved the film from any chance of a romantic twist developing, which usually deteriorates a good tight plot (for example the way the plot of the Matrix was corrupted) This movie is great fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although a box office dud at the time (thank you very much, E.T.!), this flick become a critical and cult favorite. The reputation is deserved, as it features John Carpenter's most tight and taut direction ever.The characters are pretty much unlikeable throughout, but the impressive cast (including Russell and future Emmy-winners Richard Dysart and David Clennon) make them uncomfortably human. We may not like them, but we don't want to see them butchered by this alien life form.Of course, Rob Bottin's creature FX is the movie's real drawcard, and even in the 2002, they're still nothing short of astounding. I can honestly say that the thing is still the most creative and fascinating movie monster ever to grace a horror film. The entire sequence involving the transformation of Charles Hallahan into the thing is one of the amazing, and surreal, pieces of cinema ever. The fact that Bottin didn't win an Oscar, or even get a nomination, is totally beyond me, and a slap in the face of the makeup FX master.It ain't a feel good movie, but The Thing is a classic of the genre (better than Alien) and a must see...for those who can handle it.</fullReview>

When I saw this as a kid, I was hypnotized: why were they hunting that dog? A dreadful foreboding hangs over this film from first shot to last, long after that question is answered.The music is eerie and good.

I read the book first, then was treated to the film on cable television (I was too young to see it in its theatrical release), and I must say that it excels in every aspect. The cinematography and sound are dead-on, as are the performances turned in by a fine cast. Kurt Russel is fantastic -- I can't imagine the movie having been made with any other lead. The story is as perfect as it is simplistic. And the creature effects are astounding considering the film's age. This is a movie that you can really lose yourself in -- that you can imagine the character's plight as your own. Such an internalizing aspect is difficult to achieve in the cinema, and credit goes to Mr. Carpenter for the astounding job he did modernizing a cheesy old B-move. "The Thing" is a real treat for those who haven't yet seen it.</fullReview>

Great direction by John Carpenter (who for once, THANKFULLY, does notalso provide the score for the film).A must-rent, and must-buy for horror/suspense fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>EXCELLENT, CARPENTER'S BEST</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is supposedly a remake of the 40's classic which feature James Arness as a huge alien vegetable terrorizing an Arctic expedition. Actually it turns out to be a much more faithful rendering of James Campbell's science fiction novella from the 30s without the happy ending. Kurt Russell and crew are part of Antarctic expedition which come across the wreck of an alien craft. That part follows the original movie but the monster is not a vegetable but a "shape changing" creature who can invade the body of Russell or any of the men. The language is awfully strong so parental guidance should be used but this is an very frightening and suspenseful film that doesn't need or get Carpenter's usual gore. Well worth the watch and a must for fans of the genre. Get the video and do NOT watch this with commercial interruption.</fullReview>

A great cast, some great creature effects, and an ending which seems to capitalize on this film's tough-guy motif. Better than the original, this seems to be an oddity in John Carpenter's career: a film that can actually scare you. Certainly an amazing little film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thing is one of those movies that sticks with you after you have seen it. Great special effects and a good story make this one of the most enjoyable horror/ sci-fi films ever. There is however a feeling of dread while watching this film. It's horrible to think of a creature that kills you and then absorbs what you are. Your body exists but it no longer has your soul. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys those computer generated special effects that we see all of the time. This movie makes great use of the old methods of puppetry and rubber molding that should still be used today. What you see on the screen seems real and gory and in some cases messy. In other words, it is there for you to see. Not added later by a computer. The true horror about this film is the fact that it was a box office flop. This movie deserved much better when originally released. It should have made it's money back ten times over. There is the lighter side of alien films.(like E.T.) And there is the dark side of alien films.(like The Thing) They both deserve equal viewing. See this movie with someone who has never seen it before. You will be surprised by their reaction to it. It is always favorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the last great John Carpenter movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the critics of the day had treated this movie with the utmost respect it deserved, who knows where John Carpenter would have ended up?As it is, he remains respected for his independence and commitment but is handicapped by revisiting material beneath - or corrosive of - his ability. It's a bloody tragedy that Carpenter can't take his writing more seriously now, but some of us are still hanging in there for his big comeback picture.The film lays out Carpenter's cynical take on the world like no other, and none of his other films - not even Escape From New York - has a downbeat ending that makes as much sense as this one. Wonderful, all-male ensemble cast. As for the music, the soundtrack is brilliant, but somewhat surprising is the amount of Morricone's music that didn't make it onto the screen (check out the precious CD instead which has no Carpenter on it) in favour of Carpenter's own additions.One of the all-time best, and one to keep fans loyal through thick and thin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That Thing You Do</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to see 'The Thing' on its first release in 1982. I saw it twice in 3 days at 'The Gaiety' cinema in Bristol. I recall it clearly. After 20 years, I can still vividly recall the opening shots, of a guy in a helicopter desperately trying to shoot a German Shepherd dog running through the snow in Antarctica. I still remember willing him to miss. It's a classic moment, because as the story unfolds, your hatred of the cruel, would-be pet killer completely disappears when you realise why he was trying to shoot him. Although there are many similarities to the Alien movies, 'The Thing' belongs on its own as a movie. The effects are great for 1982, and whereas most of today's horror movies carry a '15' certificate, you can still see why this is not suitable for young teenagers. I have my doubts about whether it would have attracted an '18' had it been released now, however. There's something of a 'cult status' about the feel of this movie, whatever that really means. I was lucky enough to buy it for ?10 on DVD. It's been nagging me to get it ever since I bought a DVD player. Kurt Russell has never been better; the rest of the cast are good; and the suspense from each character's mistrust of the other is something which is missing from most recent horror movies. John Carpenter, in those days, knew how to get an audience on the edge of their seats. This is not quite as good as 'Aliens' (in my view the ultimate in alien-horror movies) but it's a great movie to watch when you want a rush of adrenalin for sheer gut-churning visions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thing is an intense, claustrophobic horror film that is shot with an eye for detail. The music is fantastic (typical of John Carpenter films) and the whole thing is carried off with a style that's missing in many modern day thrillers. The beginning is top, and sets the scene wonderfully. The antarctic mountains, though snow-covered, seem dark and imposing, and you know that something evil is coming.However, the science-fiction elements seem contrived, and certain special effects haven't aged well, though others still look impressive to this day.Overall, it's an engrossing, great film, and should be viewed by all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Thing" is an intensely paranoid sci-fi/horror flick. In the Antarctic a group of researchers must face off a stranded alien which has the ability to pose as a human. They trouble is they don't know who is the alien, and who is still human..."The Thing" is done very well. There's a great desolate feeling to the Antarctic wastes - ably captured by John Carpenter's wide opening shots of the glacial landscape. The actual bases is given a nice claustrophobic feel too - no room is very large, and when there's a crowd of people there the screen reflects the intense pressure. The plot isn't really there, but that's okay next to the creepy on-edge factor you're given as you wonder who is the alien currently (I certainly jumped a fair few times in the movie). Indeed the plot centres around one person-being-revealed, and then the team of men shrinking and wondering who is next. The moments of terror are helped by lashings of gore but gore that actually disturbs, being so visceral and alien, as opposed to being laughable. The Thing is a great little creature and some neat effects are used in its creation.The acting is perfunctory, as you'd expect. Kurt Russell's character, the pilot who is the star, is played with a little edge so that he isn't the all round nice guy but someone willing to kill off anyone to ensure he survives. This leads up to a great little ending which leaves with a question mark that - thankfully - wasn't cashed in upon with a tepid sequel."The Thing" is great gory sci-fi horror. It's deliciously paranoid and can genuinely make you jump, as well let your stomach churn. It's not up to the pinnacle of the hybrid genre - the Aliens series - but it stands head and shoulders above most efforts. 8/10.</fullReview>

The setting for the film is intense the horrible blizzard like conditions add so much to this movie. Carpenter had his A game here. Kurt Russell is excellent, as is Keith David (my to favorites of the film). The suspense level just keeps building it is impossible to tell who has and has not been infected by "THE THING" There is a strong feeling of isolation involved when watching this film as if there is just nothing they can do to prevent this THING from getting to them. Carpenter does well in hiding who has and has not been infected. Make up and Creature effects are also top notch. All in all one of the finest films ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thing is destined to go down in history as one of history's greatest horror films. John Carpenter shows again that he is a talented and underappricated director. The Thing itself manages to be both scary and wonderfully creative. Kurt Russell shows one of his best performances as the scared yet determined protaganist MacReady. Wilford Brimley, Keith David, and Donald Moffat also display fine acting. John Carpenter's soundtrack is suitably weird for the movie, and Rob Bottin's monster effects stand up great even in this age of CGI. This movie will scare the crap out of you if you aren't already desensitized to this sort of thing and the tense plot leaves you wanting more. Bottom line: This is a incredible film that needs to be in your library. Get it now and remember, Man is the warmest place to hide.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My dad had a copy of this on Beta back in 1983-4. He put it in and said " The original (1951) was the only movie that ever scared me as a kid." This makes that look like a tea party. I was 21 then and it became one of my favorite movies. This is John Carpenter's best film in my opinion. It's got it all! It's dark, funny, gross and the monster is so very nasty! I also like the fact that there's no violence against women in this film (an all to familiar aspect of most horror movies). Kurt Russell and the rest of the cast are coarse in a way that really suits the characters. These are NOT the Hollywood pretties of "Scream" and "I know what you did" et. al. It's believable. Carpenter never wallows in violence for violence sake. It's just plain creepy. I'm glad to see this movie getting a following. They should make more films like this. I'm a little surprised sequel crazy Hollywood hasn't churned out a couple of more. If you haven't seen it; Rent it. If you don't own it; Buy it.

		<fullReview>Interestingly enough, my brother of 3 years younger than me informed me that when in 1983 ("The Thing" was available to be pay-per-viewed a year after it's release, but only in the pan and scan format), I found it "boring".Perhaps I was too young to fully enjoy and comprehend the realistic and isolationist paranoia-fest, or too eager (for my pre-teen lust for gore) to see what the original hyper was about (in 1982). Granted the film made it's mark on my younger years, but never to really fully appreciate it.A few years later, my brother bought a pan &amp; scan VHS copy, which was stolen from us, and then I purchased the widescreen VHS Universal re-release, and was completely amazed and submerged by what the full aspect ratio and brilliantly slow cinematography/photography added to the already cryptic and low-fi darkwave mood.The film is now , and has been for quite a while now, my all-time favorite film ever.

		<fullReview>One of the best movies in my mind. I am an aspiring film maker, and I only wish that I could of come up with the brillant work that is this movie.Originally, when I first saw it. I wasn't impressed, I was younger, stupid, and used to the original version of the "The Thing" A couple years later, I had gotten a dvd player, and when I had some money on me, I was looking to buy some dvds. Then John Carpenter's The Thing caught my eye. If you asked me why I bought this movie, i couldn't tell you why to this day, cause even though, it was the most expensive dvd, and if I had not bought it, I could have gotten 2 dvds for the same price. I went ahead and bought this movie. From then on watching it again, I realised things about it. Things I probably didnt understand when I was younger. Which is what makes this movie brillant, cause you have to think.Sure, this movie has gore and everything like that, but that doesnt mean anything! Some people view that as a bad thing, but it's not. Not everything in life is sugar coated, and if there was a thing like that from outer space, Im sure it would be alot like that way from the movie. The gore isnt what I love about it though. One thing that makes John Carpenter great, is that I think alot like him. He uses alot of cheap thrills, and to me cheap thrills are the best thrills. I love the fact that the movie is built on paranoia. The scene where Fukes, is walking with a candle, and the dark figure runs by him, and he says "who's that!?" is just scary. It leaves alot open for the imagination from that point. You ask yourself "who was that?" and since it's dark, it makes you wonder what it looked like too. That's why to me, showing the thing is not as effective as when you dont. Carpenter did have alot of gore and showed alot in the movie, but when you think about it, there was alot he didn't show. That he left open for the imagination. And you weren't sure who was who. The dvd is great too, cause you get to hear the commentary by John Carpenter and Kurt Russell. Little suttle things that Carpenter did as a director is what makes this movie great. Just one shot in the movie, of Kurt Russell from behind is really effective...because it makes you wonder "is he being watched, or is he a thing?" In my eyes, it always seemed like he was being watched, and that to me is scary.</fullReview>

Hell, it even made Wilfred Brimley scary. Trust me if you like old school horror films, not the overly derivative and boring stalker killing dozens upon dozens of uninteresting teenagers who seem to think sex and booze are the national pass time, pick up the DVD( Like Halloween widescreen is the only way to go to get the true effect of Carpenters film ).

This was so underrated because of that little 'peaceful' alien E.T. came out at about the same time, and most people saw E.T. first and were than disgusted by 'The Thing' (No complaints about E.T. though, who doesn't like him?). There are some really neat monster effects in this movie, most of them rather bizarre, but if you have seen John Carpenter movies before than you know what kind of bizarre to expect.Kurt Russell is very cool in this movie as he and the other men at the Antarctic facility try and fight off this nearly invincible foe. The monster and Kurt Russell are the whole reason to watch this movie, so if you plan on watching a conspiracy sci-fi movies, don't bother with The Thing, because this is just monsters, flame throwers, and snow, very simple stuff.This is probably my favorite sci-fi movie next to Alien and Aliens, and I think any fan of Kurt Russell, John Carpenter, or big, slimy, human killing, body transforming, mutant space creatures will love this movie. To me, Escape From New York and The Thing are John Carpenter's two best movies, so check out one or the other if your a fan of cult sci-fi classics. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>faithful to John Campbell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carpenter's remake of "The Thing" is faithful to John Campbell's 1939 story, "Who Goes There?". Carpenter modifies that which requires modification because of the passage of time (a helicopter, stored blood, computers), but retains the essential qualities and paranoia which were the keys in Campbell's story. Russell's anti-hero, McReady, is a survivor as is his extraterrestial opponent. Wilfred Brimley isconvincing as the biologist, Blair. The supporting cast is, for the most part, believable as a motley collection of men in an isolated scientific outpost.But it is the subtlety of Carpenter's hand which makes the film. The clues are laid in front of the viewer, and the viewer invariably misses them (the noose in Blair's isolation cabin as Blair pleads to come back inside; the beautifully simple test McReady gives Childs at the end of the film which shows, unbeknown to Childs -- and 99% of the viewers -- that Childs is still a human).A clever, simple film which succeeds not on special effects, prurient interest or budget -- it succeeds because it cleverly plays on our basic doubts about those around us and our fear the people we trust are not acting in our best interests. Maybe they are out to get us . ..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this several years ago, I think I was about 12, it scared the hell out of me. Then a couple of weeks ago I saw it in a video shop and had to buy it. 5 years on and its still as scary, as usual the music is dark and atmospheric. Some of the scenery too helps add to the atmosphere and sense of isolation. The opening scene is ingenious, again it helps add to the mysterious atmosphere,then something goes wrong and they realize what the opening scene was about. Its a similar Alien style of letting the alien on board and now The Thing is in the base, thats when it gets exciting (excitinger). The Thing can mimic people and so follows a mixture of paranoia and incredible special effects.The effects are gory, some of them just really make you think "Whats going on in John Carpenters head?" They really are that weird, but then that only adds to the credibility of this alien in that it is so weird and well...Alien. As I have mentioned quite a few times this is a very atmospheric film, the music, the way its directed, the cold, dark, desolate feeling. The Characters too are very good, though MacReady(Russell) and possibly Gary and Blair stand out as some of the more interesting characters. If there is a flaw its possibly in the actual physics of the creature. The Assimilation process seems unclear, there is a vague explanation which having seen several times now still seems unclear. But this is a minor fault and really does no harm overall to the film. The effects at the ending are a real extravaganza, Russell in full Snake mode(escape from L.A./New York) delivers a crisp one liner before finishing off the Thing. I really liked this film, its very atmospheric and dark, the clever twists and turns are real edge of your seat stuff and the effects are incredible.If you want to be scared out of your wits this is definitely for you. The whole alien body snatching theme isn't that original and possibly the actual technical side of the Thing could do with some refining. Overall though a damn good film, a must for any horror fan. I'd say 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whenever I see a movie, I am extremely willing to suspend reality for 120 minutes, especially for Sci-Fi or Horror movies. But, please, do not insult my intelligence within that framework. To me, the biggest draw-back to most movies of this genre is that the characters were siphoned off the shallow end of the gene pool! For example, there are no lights in the house, my best friend just got sawed in half, so therefore we will all split up and look around with a pack of matches! (They deserve whatever fate awaits them!!) But this movie, "the Thing", absolutely impressed me in that the characters actually reacted as most REAL people would faced with an unknown terror. For me, no matter how far fetched and absurd the plot, as long as the characters remain as human as possible, then I become totally absorbed and fully entertained by the movie. "The Thing", to me, was the first movie of the "evil-alien" genre that showed me real people reacting as best as they could to an unknown terror. I did not have to stretch my imagination to fit these people into the story line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great horror film about to get revamped: again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While many of us agree that this is, by far, either the best, or second best, movie John Carpenter has ever made, we all agree on one thing: The ending gave no sense of closure.I'm happy to announce that now, there will be closure! Universal is currently working on a video game entitled "The Thing" that takes place where the movie left off! So now do we not only get to finally have some closure (or will we?) for this movie, but we get to experience it as close to first-hand as we can. Or maybe, as close as we want to....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange things are happening on the South Pole</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It all started when a husky ran into the U.S. research base in Antarctica, pursued and being shot at by some Norwegians who don't live to tell why exactly they were hurling grenades from a heli at the poor mutt. Further investigation reveals that something really spooky has taken place in the Norwegian base. No survivors again, only burnt remains, in indistinguishable shapes. Meanwhile, the husky has found a new home in the U.S. base.We see about a dozen guys working there, scientists mostly, among them heli-pilot MacReady, played by Kurt Russell. The dog in the meantime is walking around, sniffing, doing the stuff that dogs basically do before it's put in the kennel with the others. Although it's difficult to see through the darkness it turns out that we're not dealing with a dog at all. No, it's some bizarre creature that shoots tentacles to try and grab the other dogs.....and emulate them!Turns out a spacecraft of some sort has landed in Antarctica thousands of years ago and the Norwegians have accidentally dug it up, waking an occupant who was probably not in the best of moods. Stealth is its weapon, taking over any creature when it sees the chance and then getting rid of the original. Question now, has the dog infected any of the humans? Who is real, and who is a copy? Further bummer: you're in the most inhospitable environment on Earth and a storm is closing in. Escape is impossible.Paranoia ensues, protagonist MacReady doesn't know who to trust and tries to come up with a way of discovering who's who, getting sleepier and sleepier in the process. No one to trust. Is it Blair who destroyed the generators and radio so the creature cannot escape to the civilized world, thus isolating the group completely. Or is it short-fused Childs, who wants to shoot and ask questions later. What about the guy responsible for the pack of huskies? He was near that kennel for an awful long time, just by himself. And who's that guy running around outside in the dead of night? No creature from this Earth can survive in those temperatures...So the story unfolds, accompanied by an eerie Ennio Morricone soundtrack in the background. Special mention must go to effects, that set a new standard for 'gore' in 1982. The performances are all fine, the direction never slips and those that haven't seen it are lucky, for they can guess and guess. Especially when MacReady finally figures out how to smoke out 'The Thing', in one of the most suspenseful scenes of all time.Critically axed at its release, now critically acclaimed and rightly so. Carpenter mused: 'no one is ever going to see something like this again', and he was correct. This is a one-of-a-kind, the best horror/sci-fi ever made. BTW, as far as I know, this is the only movie that doesn't have any women in it (not that I have something against women).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an absolutely brilliant modern day horror. Combines incredible special effects with one of the scariest situations imaginable. The tautness of the film is astounding; the tone is constantly tense due to the story's inherently suspenseful nature. There is no comic relief, no oops...just a cat scenes - just constant paranoia. 20 minutes into the film, you realize that absolutely anything could happen at anytime. There is absolutely no way to predict what will transpire - the possibilities are endless. One of the most open-ended incredible plots ever, and beautifully filmed by Carpenter and realized by Rob Bottin (note the thank you to none other than Stan Winston at the end of the film.) Yes thank you Stan. The effects are amazing - especially for the time - but as another reviewer has aptly stated, they are always secondary to the story. And of course Keith David rocks. Russell and Brimley put on fine performances as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Thing", directed by John Carpenter, is actually a remake of a previous film titled "The Thing from Another World" that both terrifies and excites many times during the movie. With bravura special effects by Rob Bottin (The Howling, Fight Club, etc.), "The Thing" centers around a group of scientists in Antarctica who come across something much worse that anyone could have expected. Carpenter's other films he directed after this still can't touch this film as it remains potent to this day. Besides "Halloween", this is Carpenter's best attempt at horror. The ending does leave it open for a sequel, but unfortunately, the low box office for this film didn't merit one. It's a shame because this is a modern sci-fi classic that everyone should attempt to see. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aside from my favorite Horror series Evil Dead 1,2,3. The Thing by John Carpenter has got to be the scariest, most goreiest movie ever. Its about a groups of scientists at an Anartica research lab who discover a 100,000 year old alien life form which can form into any thing it gets it disgusting little paws on.... Freaky Stuff.... The special effects are amazing, especially since it was made in 1982. This movie looks like it was made yesterday. The violence once again... is over the top and very, very stomach churning but it is all a joy to sit through. The only advice i can give you is too go BUY this movie now its totally awsome.My Rating- Out of 5 stars- *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw it when I was about eight years old and it left me with nightmares for many weeks after. And when I saw it years later I still found it more scary then any other film I had seen. Next to the brilliant special effects ( which totally do not look out of date compared to today's computerized stuff), it is especially the extremely claustrophobic atmosphere that is created by a cast acting brilliantly in combination with a beautiful, yet terrifying icy scenery and extremely creepy music (tones). It starts with the scenery and music and will slowly become the most paranoia thing you will ever experience in a movie. Brilliant!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, Unparalleled Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was around the tender age of eight or so my dad let me watch the edited-for-television version of this movie, and being an eight-year-old it scared the crap out of me. Just recently I was compelled to rent the video and to my astonishment it scared me even more then it had when I was little. The feelings of isolation and pure terror that are created by John Carpenter, Rob Bottin, and the rest of the cast and crew are uncompromisingly brutal and harsh. With almost no comic relief, no feminine characters, and unrelenting suspense, Carpenter doesn't allow himself to get bogged down in formulaic plot twists or romance. He keeps the characters clear-cut and simple, defining them by their actions alone. The "Thing" itself is a gory wonder, and apparently Bottin, the special effects supervisor, had to check himself into a hospital at the end of the shoot because he was reeling from exhaustion. The suspense scenes (like at the beginning of the movie when the dog is being chased by the Norwegian helicopter, for no apparent reason) work extremely well. This is by far Carpenter's best effort as a director (apologies to those who think differently). Carpenter never relents in his suspense, and that is what separates this from most other horror movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched "The Thing" again for the first time in years. I am amazed by how well it stands up almost 20 years later. The only distracting anachronism is that one of the characters is named "Windows," evoking thoughts of Microsoft throughout. The effects are still cutting-edge, except for one brief stop-motion animation scene. The suspense is amazing and the characters all act very naturally-- there is an almost complete absence of clichs, and the clichs that are left don't seem like clichs. The cast is solid. There is also a blessed absence of gratuitous false-alarm scares-- no cats jumping out of cupboards. Definitely one of the best sci-fi/horror movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My sister and I saw this version of "The Thing" when it came to theaters in 1982. We enter the theater with our snacks . . . the lights dim . . . we suffer through endless coming attractions . . . then it starts. After the opening sequence we're sitting there getting ready to enjoy a scary movie when all of a sudden this incredibly eerie music begins to play. It was SO creepy that we walked out of the theater and saw "Bladerunner" instead. We vowed to come back the following week and try it again. This time my sister had brought her pillow - YES, her pillow to hide behind. This is embarrasing because we were 17 and 23 years old at the time. We gathered our courage up and sat through one the most frightening movies ever made! It is second only to "The Exorcist". This movie, about a team of scientists in Antarctica who come face to face with an alien being able to disguise itself as man and beast, will blow you away! See it once to be grossed out, then see it again and watch the fine performances of the actors. I'll never forget the film critic, Leonard Maltin giving this movie a "1" on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 begin very bad). I have never trusted his word since. He obviously didn't see the same movie we did! But then again, if everyone listened to critics, no one would have ever seen "The Wizard of Oz" because they sandblasted it too in its day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some points of interest ****(spoilers alert)****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1) Apart from the female contestants, in whatever cheesy gameshow Palmer is watching on the video, there are NO women at all in this film.2) It is clearly stated that only Doctor Copper and Garry could have sabotaged the blood stored in the freezer unit (thereby scuppering a test that could have potentially exposed which of the men was a thing). There were no marks on the lock and the aforementioned men were the only ones with access to the freezer unit's key. Hence both men are treated with considerable suspicion. Yet it turns out that neither man was actually a thing, which leaves a loose end that is never tied up.3)It appears that Palmer and Norris had been replaced by things before it is realised that a thing can absorb someone and take their form. If this is the case why does Norris turn down the chance to replace Garry as the leader when Garry nominates him? Surely from the things' point of view that was an opportunity missed. It also means that when Palmer speaks the classic "You have got to be f***ing kidding me" line, after Norris's head has disatatched itself and sprouted spider legs, it is actually a thing in disguise giving that very human reaction, and speaking for a generation of eighties horror fans.4)Garry does not come across as being an overly liberal base commander. Yet he allows Palmer (whilst still human) to smoke dubious substances in his presence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True to Form "Remake" &amp; Carpenter's Best Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "The Thing," John Carpenter does what is truly meant for a filmmaker to do with a remake of an earlier work-- update and add your own spin. Inspired by "The Thing From Another Planet," and that film's basis on the short story "Who Goes There?", John Carpenter's "The Thing" is a masterpiece in horror and sci-fi cinema-- not to mention Carpenter's single greatest film to date (sorry "Halloween" fans!).Due to incredibly bad timing at the box office (E.T. anyone?) "The Thing" was a commercial failure-- but found a "cult" following on video, and for good reason. Carpenter exploits his ensemble cast (with the like of Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, T.K. Carter, and best of all Keith David) and claustrophobic Antartic setting to provide the viewer with true feelings of paranoia and fear.The story itself centers around a mysterious alien creature that crash landed into the Antartic thousands of years ago. After a scientific team digs up the creature's spacecraft, it thaws out, and the terror begins. Able to manipulate its body to imitate any other living being, the members of the scientific team soon turn on each other-- no one knowing who to trust when anyone could be... "The Thing."Movie fans in general will get a kick out of "The Thing," which is required viewing for any true horror or sci-fi fan. If you can, get a hold of the DVD or watch the film during a run on the Sci-Fi channel-- Carpenter's films, especially this one, are not worth seeing if you cannot see them in the widescreen aspect ratio.Highly recommended. Rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie about ten years ago...It has stuck on my mind ever since. The movie is set on a Norwegian camp, and being Norwegian myself, it was most enjoyable to see Norbert Weisser (also seen in a small role as a swede in Midnight Express) play a frantic Norwegian screaming:"Get the hell away! It`s not a dog! It imitates a dog! It`s not real! Get away, idiots!" after chasing a mysterious dog around in a chopper with a rifle, meeting Kurt Russell &amp; friends on the camp. Norbert speaks Norwegian indeed...and well, contrary to what "all of you" might think. "The Thing" is after "Alien", my favourite movie ever. It has a remarkable way of totally enwrapping you into it`s own kind of atmosphere..the soundtrack, the lighting, the acting, the camera-shots, the sounds and the setting is so perfectly matched, and takes you on an unforgettable ride... I`m not a big fan of John Carpenter. Don`t like anything else he has made, I think, but "The Thing"...is GOOD! As I wrote earlier, my favourite film is "Alien", and "The Thing" resembles "Alien" in many ways. A bunch of guys trapped together, trying to kill a monster, before it kills them. Both movies are packed with stunning cinematography, sombre music, scary sound effects, amazing monsters and top-notch acting. And scary as hell!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We have seen lots of special effects bonanzas in the last ten years. They have tried big budget movies with big explosions (Demolition Man), and incredibly horrific special effects (Braindead). Did those make great films? No. But John Carpenter just turns round and hands us `The Thing'. This film is very disturbing in it's gruesome special effects, but also supplies us with a fantastic cast, top-class dialogue, engrossing plot, beautiful shots, and most of all, scares.With most people, this is without a doubt in their top 5 horror/sci-fi films. This may not be as scary as Carpenters closer movie to this, Prince Of Darkness, but the overall quality is so unbelievable, it is a film you will want to see again, next time with a bigger screen and better sound.For once in a film like this, you will actually care about the cast. Here they are all referred to as their second name. The film constantly asks you questions; `Who is the thing?' and `Who is human?' Most films that ask you questions always make you keen to watch. And it works here. I refuse to spoil the film, but `the thing' itself is a shape-shifter, and can decide to take on human-like structures and their attributes. Let's cut to it, some of the cast are actually `the thing', and they remaining humans have to find out who isn't human. All this 1000 miles away in the Antarctic, with no contact with outsiders. The `things' themselves are pretty horrifying. They imitate human cells and morph into all sorts of shapes and sizes. The first example of this is where some huskies have been `digested', or `absorbed' by the thing, their severed heads appear all over a horrific meat-like structure with eyes. The special effects actually look real, which makes a change from all this modern-day CGI garbage. A horrible sight indeed. The `thing' appears even more terrifying later on in the film. Anyway, the acting is superb. Unlike 90% of horror movies, the cast aren't so stupid as to confront the entity. I don't care who you are, you don't confront a head which has just spawned spiders legs. Here, they run away. Nice to see a normal reaction like this. The way the whole thing is filmed is absolutely beautiful. We get atmospheric shots of the desolate station without time wasting like we saw in `The Shining'. The way the next shot can be presented as the present when in fact it's the future works tremendously well. Like for example in the blood test scene (for me, the tensest scene in movie history). I love the way Kurt Russell takes charge of the whole situation, it really brings his character out. Kurt Russell in good film shock! The lighting is absolutely spot on, it creates an awesome isolating atmosphere. Whilst the blood-and-gore factor in this film is rather high, at no point does it carry the film. The Thing has everything else just right to justify their presence. Even Clive Barkers Hellraiser or Braindead didn't create such warped sights as this, and this works when presented as serious!John Carpenters best piece of work. An absolute must-see film. A classic.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film poster tagline,"The Ultimate In Alien Terror", says it all about the 1982 remake of Howard Hawks' horror/sci-fi masterpiece "The Thing From Another World" simply called "The Thing".Horror master John Carpenter stylizes the short story,"Who Goes There?" about a group of scientists who travel the snowy backdrops of Antarctica as they find a buried spaceship that contains a bizzare frozen organism that when it thaws out,it kills every human being.The gory and stylish special make-up effects and Albert Whitlock's special effects help make the film an instant classic.Although panned by both critics and filmgoers at the time of its release,"The Thing" has found an audience on both video and TV.I would recommend watching this film in the ever popular "letterbox" format so you really can see all the high paced action,all the great special effects,and in director John Carpenter's original vision.A real treat for the not so squemish!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of Howard Hawks' version of The Thing (the first adaptation of the great novella, "Who Goes There?"), but I believe that John Carpenter's 1982 version has unjustly been condemned as "just a remake." Carpenter resurrects the most original aspect of "Who Goes There?" in making the titular alien a shape-shifter... able to mimic anything... including humans. Who's real? Who's the thing? These disturbing questions together are the driving force of the film. Couple this with Carpenter's superb direction (I defy you to find any film-maker better than Carpenter at the wide-screen composition), great acting (Kurt Russell is severely under-rated) and the most original special effects in any film I can think of (think Dali, then add more goop), and you have one of the best films of the 80s. The Invasion of the Body Snatchers of its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting, atmospheric... a favorite!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's "The Thing" has that indefinable SOMETHING, combined with so much atmosphere (helped greatly by the soundtrack) that turns a good movie into a cult classic. This film is genuinely CREEPY, and can be watched over and over. I own it on DVD and *never* get tired of it. The interactions between the men at the antarctic outpost are done so well, the acting is excellent, the story is scary and creepy and the special effects... well, at this point I'll just say "See the movie." I highly doubt you'll regret it. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful filmmaking. What a horror film should be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thing is a masterpiece of suspense, horror, and gore. No other movie (with the exception of the first three Living Dead movies) has matched The Thing in taking these three elements and blending them into not only a horror film, but a timeless piece of filmaking art. The seclusion, the hopelessness, the creeping terror of not knowing who is who...all of these add up to what modern horror films should take notes from. Carpenter hit his mark and the pinnacle of the art with this movie. It has been compared to Alien several times. But, while Alien is a work of art...its a different kind of style in which the movie was filmed. The Thing begins with a downward spiral into terror and never lets its foot off the gas. The acting is superb, the setting is perfect, the special effects are some that even today cannot be rivaled by CGI, and the tension ever present. If you've never seen it, see it. If you have, see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an absolutely great movie, definitely Kurt Russell's best ever.John Carpenter's "The Thing" holds my top spot among Sci-Fi horror films (in a tie with the original Alien). I can think of no other in that genre that comes close to those two. I have watched it over and over again and pick up new little subtleties each time. If you have not seen it, check it out ASAP. I wish they still made films like this rather than the crap Hollywood puts out today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror Pic Must See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best horror/scifi pics ever made.One unique aspect is that the focus constantly shifts during the movie from character to character. Anyone and everyone is suspect. The special effects are very effective and do not appear dated. This one has it all, great action, spooky parts, horror, and great one liners (the one in the dog kennel is my fav).Popular culture has so promoted the whiteness of winter as pure and good, Carpenter does a fantastic job of showing how the white and cold artic can be the perfect environment for horror.So on top of first class action, horror, suspense and general spooky wierd mood, there is some pretty funky acting by all the cast. Where else can you see Wilford Brimly, the typecast milktoast, go completely berserk?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will anyTHING top this Sci-Fi Horror flick? Not Yet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, this is unquestionably the best science fiction / horror flick of all time, and I can explain why. First of all, the story is fantastic, based on "Who goes there" by John W. Campbell and adapted by Bill Lancaster. Although made into a movie earlier in 1951, the first shot at making the movie simplified the story and had a creature that was much different than the one envisioned by Campbell.The latest version captures the claustrophobia and paranoia of the story it is based on, and in my view, improves upon it. The cast is magnificent. You just don't get top notch actors like this working together with such incredible chemistry in your average monster pick. There is always the actor you wind up going "why in the world is HE/SHE in this movie?" about, always a weak link.Not so here, where everyone gives stellar performances, the characters act like real people would in their situation and the photography by Dean R. Cundey and direction by John Carpenter are amazing.And let's not forget the jaw-dropping special effects by Rob Bottin and Stan Winston, which hold up as good or better than just about any computer effects I've seen. Below is the criteria for which I judge all horror and sci-fi movies now, and this movie gets a 10 in every category. Can you think of another one that can?1.Story / Adaptation: True to original, excellently written. the script begins eerily and escalates to a fantastic climax.2.Direction: Truly creepy and claustrophobic with scary hand held work and disturbing camera angles and movements.3.Acting: EVERYONE is good here, not one even halfway lame performance. The actors act like real people would, and work really well together to create a believable atmosphere.4.Photography: Beautifully shot by Dean Cundey, the film makes you feel cold it's so representative--which brings me to...5.Location: External shots were done on location in British Colombia, lending a believable arctic quality to the feel of the film. Internal shots were done on a refrigerated set to mix seamlessly with the feel of the outdoor stuff.6.Music: Score is haunting, fitting, and used well. Also, it's done by veteran film guy Ennio Morricone...what else could you ask for? Bernard Hermann wasn't around!7. Special effects: Innovative to say the least, this Thing really LOOKS scary. You don't want anything that looks like that coming near you! Realistic blood, believable wounds, it's...well...great.8. Ending: I would mention the ending here, but they wouldn't print the review. Just as well, though, as it is terrific. Let's just say it's very "Non-Disney".Well, that's my list of why it wins as the best sci-fi horror flick of all time for me. I've seen lots and lots of 'em and it STILL tops the list even after years and years. I'll keep looking for a better one, but it seems to me they just don't put the kind of bank into making them like they did with this one anymore, and even if they did, the chances of getting all eight of the above as good or better is going to be quite a feat.X.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Swiss Army knife of what is horrifying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** When I was a young lad still not of age to get into an R-rated movie, I used to look longingly at the lobby posters on my way into a PG film (this was in the days before PG-13, folks) and dream of better things. One such poster I lingered over was for John Carpenter's re-make of the 1951 black and white sci-fi flick The Thing.For anyone who remembers said poster (or has even seen the cover art on the videocassette box, for that matter), the picture is dominated by a looming figure whose face is obscured by a burst of crystallized light. The figure is clad in a bulky snowsuit and gloves, reaching out towards the viewer. Friends, that poster scared the holy beejezus out of me. Come to think of it, that may be the only poster that ever gave me such a bad case of the creeps.As for the film itself, talk about whetting your whistle: On a brisk Antarctica morning at National Science Foundation Outpost #31, the 12-man resident staff are surprised to see a sled dog being chased into their camp by a helicopter-borne pack of frostbitten, raving Norwegians, one of whom is plonking away at it with a high-powered rifle. The majority of this hunting expedition manage to blow themselves up (two lessons learned: one, short-timed explosives and deep, powdery snow don't mix; two: I don't know what word that Norwegian used just before the big boom, but I'm pretty sure it was a good bit stronger than "drat") and the one remaining gets shot through the eye by the camp commander Garry. Garry, we will find, is always ready to go for the head shot.After a brief caucus, helicopter pilot MacReady and Doc Copper tool on out to the Norwegian base to scout for survivors of the presumed outbreak of cabin fever. What they find instead is a camp full of holes, ice and snow, with everyone dead by suicide or smoldering on a burn heap out back. While sifting through the scattered scientific knickknacks, they also happen across a large block of ice with a likewise large hole in it (watch for the precariously swinging icicle - I didn't know they did that).The Norwegian's video logs lead the Americans to an excavation site near their own camp. The unfortunate Europeans apparently had uncovered a huge space ship buried for some hundred thousand years (I'm going to be charitable and only refer to it here as a "flying saucer", despite its perfect dinner plate shape) with the...er, top hatch open. A few dozen yards away is a rectangular hole in the ground more or less corresponding with the size of the block of ice at the shattered camp.Back at home base, the dog that narrowly escaped becoming a bullet caddie at the hands of the Norwegians is put into the kennel with the other huskies. Once the nosy humans have departed, though, the newcomer begins to noisily and juicily (there really isn't any other way to put it) shed its skin and manhandle its more terrestrial counterparts. Hearing the howls coming from the kennel, MacReady sounds the alarm (smashing the glass facing with a can of Budweiser, how cool is that?). He and Garry pump a few dozen rounds into the mutating visitor before Childs flash-fries it with a flame thrower.On a side note here, I wonder how many Antarctic research stations come with flamethowers. It's not exactly like you can de-ice your windshield with them. I think Alan Dean Forester's book touches on this point, but it's been so long since I've read it, I can't be sure.With a heavy assist from MaCReady (pretty good, considering his penchant for the sauce), our boys put two and two together. The Norwegians had found an alien frozen in the ice, carted it back to their camp and thawed it out. The Thing (as it is unofficially dubbed) thaws out and wreaks the expected amount of havoc before beating a hasty retreat across the frozen wasteland. Enter our heroes.The Thing, Blair hypothesizes, is able to absorb other life forms and reshape its own body to assume the appearance of anything it has ingested. The imitation is perfect and undetectable, at least on the basis of sight alone. As usual, animals are hip to the deception (the other dogs went wild when the newcomer was put into their kennel), but humans aren't so lucky.Here the paranoia begins to take root. The Thing masquerading as the dog had been wandering around the camp for hours and could have infected any one of the team, perhaps more than one. The men eye each other with increasing suspicion as the disappearances begin. The race begins to find a way of determining who is still human and who is The Thing.Security in my hometown theater was uncommonly vigorous back in 1982, so I never got the chance to see The Thing on the big screen. Instead, I was inducted via videotape in a basement den at three in the morning with four of my friends glued to the screen. Our nerves has already been raked over the hot coals by a back-to-back viewing of Evil Dead 2 and A Nightmare on Elm Street, somewhere between four and fourteen Cokes on top of no food (we'd spent all our food money on videos like responsible young people). By the time The Thing was over and our host was loading up another Carpenter opus, Prince of Darkness, we were looking at each other much in the same way that Jack Torrance looked at Grady in the washroom of the Overlook in The Shining.The Thing is a masterwork of suspicion and paranoia. The problem is wilier than suspecting someone of being a pod person. Pod people, we have learned, don't show emotion, while The Thing can imitate emphatic speech, anger, hostility and all the other passionate emotions so as to be undetectable from a human being. The only person you don't suspect is MacReady, and that's only because most of us wouldn't think Kurt Russell would let an alien get the drop on him. But you never know...The almost choking atmosphere is enriched by the idea of the location (an almost completely cut-off compound in the literal middle of nowhere) and the location itself. Carpenter includes many pointedly lingering shots of empty, poorly-lit hallways, giving an impression of both the vulnerability of the camp's inhabitants and the million or so hiding places available to the camp's invader.As usual, Carpenter wrote the music for the film. This is a hit-or-miss practice for him, and here it is dead on the mark. The thudding, simplistic soundtrack is a perfect match for the increasing sense of dread as the story unfolds.The acting is so solid as to be almost flawless. No one character is focused on as far as his background, motives, etc. are concerned. The only importance they have is what they contribute to the unfolding events. Carpenter realizes the necessity of this collectively light handling of such a relatively large starring cast (no one can be considered "supporting" here) and he manipulates each man's screen time like a professional puppeteer.The Thing itself is a masterpiece of special effects. I have to pluralize that because it assumes several different shapes, and it's impossible to say which one is its natural form. These shapes vary from something resembling The Aliens Deadly Spawn to The Incredible Melting Man to a kind of demonically mutated Alaskan snow crab (think about that last one when Blair cracks the leg off). There's none of that hokey matting or baldly obvious CGI to be found here; rather, The Thing is all traditional foam latex, animatronics and gallons and gallons of trusty old stage blood.It's rare to find a film, especially a horror film, that can stand the test of time to resist appearing dated after a number of years. Eighteen years later, the special effects in The Thing still blow me away. I seem to recall that when it premiered, said effects were so gruesome and over-the-top that Time magazine ran a pictorial with some of the choicer scenes. If Time acknowledges a horror flick within its hallowed pages,you know Carpenter must have struck a chord.Have no illusions, The Thing is a bloody film. It's not as graphic as some I've seen, but it can still carry its weight in the gore department. Definitely not the film to watch while eating room temperature raspberry pudding. Yet it is one of those movies that buffs refer to as a "must see." It has so much going for it on so many levels that I can overlook the minor stumbling blocks such as Blair's seven-shot revolver, MacReady's incredible disappearing snow hat and a few other inconsequential trivialities. A close scrutiny of this phenomenal blend of science fiction and outright visceral horror is an absolute necessity for anyone interested in either genre.In way of an afterword, the following are some faces you might remember having seen elsewhere: MacReady: This, in my opinion, has been Kurt Russell's finest role ever, and stomps hell out of both his turns as Snake Plissken in Carpenter's "Escape From..." movies. Norris: Charles Hallahan here sports a slightly bushier head of hair than in Dante's Peak. Copper: Richard Dysart is no stranger to horror films, having starred in the John Frankenheimer flick Prophecy (not The Prophecy, just Prophecy!) as the eeeeeeeeevil paper mill foreman. It must be noted that in 1984 he also contributed his voice to the TV cartoon Challenge of the GoBots. Blair: Wilford Brimley (sans mustache), the guy from the Quaker Oatmeal commercial! Don't think the hot cereal jokes weren't being hooted fast and furious. Oh, yeah, and he was also in The Firm. Childs: Keith David has also given his voice to Spawn on the HBO animated series of the same name, although my favorite role of his was as Louis, the psycho garbage collection supervisor in Men at Work. Clark: Donald Moffat is another one of those actors along the lines of Lance Henrikson who has been in nearly everything, including It, The Believers and Nightmares.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A study in paranoia *spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this film. I recently bought it and watched it last night with my boyfriend, who hadn't seen it. He really doesn't care much for tv or movies. He was reading a book while I was cuddled up next to him on the couch for protection. Needless to say he put the book down. This movie has always frightened me. I think it's the paranoia that intrigues me the most. The fact that we don't know let's us experience the character's hysteria. I think the reason I appreciate this film so much is that the characters do not find a solution. This is what is so scary. The language barrier between the Norwegians and the Americans isn't broken as a character reveals some hidden talent for languages. (referring to the notes that they find) The chance to do the test the doctor suggests is sabotaged. The person then put in charge of finding a new way to test for infection disappears. We never get an answer as to what happened with him. The one that Macready comes up with is perfect. It's simple yet does the job.The effects in this are horrifying, even after all these years. This movie has really held up. At the end when Macready and Childs are looking at each other and know they are both going to die is truly moving. Yet you're still scared because you don't know if one of them is infected or not that the fate of the world still doomed despite their altruistic actions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are familiar with my other reviews for IMDB than you know I like to champion underrated or forgotten films. Apart from DAY OF THE DEAD, this is the most obvious example. I'm not even going to mention the b+w classic from the 50's (anymore), because they are two separate movies entirely. THE THING is a very cold and paranoid jaw-dropper of a film that, among other unique things, supports an entirely male cast, including my vote for curmudgeon of the century, oatmeal guy Wilford Brimley. And cool-as-always Kurt Russell, and a load of those "hey I've seen that guy before" actors. The score is very silent and sneaky, the exact opposite of the chaos going on inside the research compound. I'm not going to give you any more specific plot details. I will warn/tell you that the "thing" of the title is one of the most EXTREME and creative movie monsters ever. To heck with ALIEN. Do severed heads grow spider legs and scurry away in ALIEN. Do lumps of muscle and flesh "absorb" four snowdogs? Man, I'm telling you, if you've never seen this movie, DO IT!! You are in for such a treat. I wish I could have a career of doing nothing but observing people while they watch THE THING for the first time. The Sci-Fi channel frequently airs a cut version which I strongly suggest you avoid unless you really can't handle the "meat and potatoes" that the network had to slice off. Best viewing experience is watching the DVD while eating things that are squishy. I LOOOOOOOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Superior Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very seldom do remakes even approach the quality of their parent film. Most are on a par with Dino DeLaurentiis' "King Kong", overblown reminders of what made the original a classic. John Carpenter's version of "The Thing," however, has the advantage of being able to return to its original source, John W. Campbell's "Who Goes There?", and from there reinvent itself using a fantastic cast and the best makeup effects of the 1980s.The result is, in my opinion, Carpenter's best film. It's not for the squeamish, or to watch on a cold and snowy night (like I did once -- freaked myself out!), but if you're in the mood for terror and suspense, this is it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of John Carpenter's movies - especially Halloween and The Thing. The Thing is by far one of the best movies that he has ever made and in my opinion one of the best science fiction movies of all time. Kurt Russell plays the role of McReady to a `t'. His acting was really convincing as was the other awesome actors you find in this movie. I really thought that the music (as in Halloween) was a great way to create the suspense in The Thing. Carpenter has a great way and super timing when he plays that very simple but errie music. The whole idea of the men being trapped in the Antarctic with an alien was super. The creature effects were great considering the year this movie was made. Now I want to mention some of my favorite scenes in The Thing. My #1 fav. scene was when they men were tied up to the chairs and McReady was testing the blood with the hot metal to see which person was actually an alien. The part with the men screaming and shaking in their chair was a classic! My #2 fav. scene was when the men were outside at night in the snow gathered together, and McReady says that he knows some of them are human or else they would all attack him at once. If you watch this scene it really sets the mood and tone for the rest of the film. I'm happy that they never made a sequel to this movie because if you cannot top the original (which would be true in this case) then why make a sequel. If you haven't seen The Thing - RENT IT!!!!! It is up there on my list with the first 2 Alien movies and in many ways I think surpasses them. Way to go Mr. Carpenter!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been 18 years since I first saw John Carpenter's The Thing, and it continues to occupy the top slot in my list of the scariest movies of all time. There's something primally terrifying about that-which-cannot-be-stopped, and the Antarctic setting conveys a realistic feel of isolation that outstrips the aloneness in all three Aliens films (none of us have ever been to distant space outposts, but we can relate to the icy solitude of a human environment). Yes, H. R. Geiger's Aliens were mind-numbingly horrific, in their speed and agility and sheer foreignness to everything human; in that regard, they capture the title as best extraterrestrials in film. But though The Thing's creatures are also of alien origin, they fall more neatly--and fulfill completely--the niche of movie monster. This disturbing film is a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good and bad but so memorable that I had to write about it - spoiler (kind of)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so this is a bit of a classic, made in the same year I was born. I must say I was really liking this movie until the last ten minutes. There were way too many implications and plot glitches. So anyway, let's weigh up the pro's and cons.Special effects: good for the time. Kurt Russell's best role. Palmer is f--kin rad. Always something happening. (seldom boring) Excellent tension build up. the token black guys are also cool. The music is very fitting. (and chilling)On the bad side there are a number of plot problems.let's look at who is and isn't the thing over the movie: (spoiler bit) Is: palmer, windows, norris, Bennings, Blair? isn't: fuchs, nauls, garry, childs,clarke,doc,macready.They didn't have to kill everyone, and why did they just end up with the hero and one random guy? how did clarke not become the thing too? how do we know who was the thing first out of norris and palmer? who infected them? was it blair? what's the deal with blair? or was it the corpse of that dog or Bennings? The Norwegian guys and Clarke were unfairly killed and no one really seemed to give s--t.Ultimately I probably sound pretty stupid and have missed a number of things - I was watching this very late at night.I also wonder about some of the metaphorical aspects of the film. Maybe the ending is more realistic, but the supernatural premise of the film is unrealistic so they may as well just have had the token "sentimental" ending. The arctic setting is barren and agoraphobic, it reminds me of movies like Batman, where it seems the city or place they live in is the whole world and it doesn't matter what is happening everywhere else.Ultimately it's quite the interesting film and fun to speculate over too. I guess I can overlook the bad points and I'll just have to concentrate on the goods.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently bought this film on DVD. It had been a number of years since I had last seen it, but I recalled being impressed with the special effects and location so I decided to check it out again. What an excellent film !The basic outline of the story is that a group of American scientists are alerted to strange goings-on in a nearby Norwegian outpost. After investigating, they discover the charred remains of a hideously deformed 'thing' outside the burnt out Norwegian compound. As you do, they take it back to base, only to discover it isn't dead and whatever it is that they have found has the ability to transform itself into other living organisms, including the scientists. Without giving too much away, the scientists must try and identify who is human and who is alien before it's too late. Excellent special effects and a great supporting cast lead by Kurt Russell, breathtaking cinematography and exceptional direction by John Carpenter make this a timeless film which will have you on the edge of your seat. Does anyone survive ? You'll have to watch and see ! The DVD features a wealth of extra features including a documentary and commentary, which further add to the enjoyment of the film itself.</fullReview>

The one perculiar aspect of the film, that no one noticed, was the fact that there were no women in the film...something that would have sparked controversy nowadays. Still this film was very scary and very exciting considering you spend the entire movie trying to figure out who the alien is. Kurt Russel was outstanding as were nearlly all the other actors. John Carpenter, who just so happens to have the same birthday as me, is my most favourite director and this film really shows that he is the master of screen horror although his latest work has'nt really been his best. I am confident however that John has got something very exciting cooking up for all of us......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best horror movie ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is simply the most underrated horror movie ever. It is also the best.When I think horror movie, The Thing is the first movie that comes to mind.Horror movies in my mind are partly special effects. This movie is partly special effects, which is what all the critics couldn't get past. Horror movies to me are also mostly psychological. If the movie can hit and maintain that one disturbing note than it has worked. The Thing keeps that note vibrating through the whole movie. The intrigue and tone is set in the first five minutes.(Not the unnecessary opening titles) What a great way to start a movie and make the viewer think.Yes this movie has incredible effects but they are all secondary to the story. This movie works on so many different levels you can't pigeon hole it because of it's special effects. The special effects are just what's on the surface. The movie works because of the story.The Thing actually makes you think. It's kind of a twist on the who done it mystery. Everything works perfectly. The simplistic heartbeat like score from Ennio Morricone. The isolated setting. The acting. The editing. The great cinematography.Although each character isn't overtly developed, there is a lot of subtlety (something all too rare today) in each performance.This is probably Kurt Russell's best performance. Not that he has a lot of dialogue. It's all in the facial expressions and what he doesn't say but rather communicates with body language. Like when he removes his hood in the climax.Another key performance is Keith David's. Watch his fearful face when he is tied up. His performance in this has made me a fan of his work ever since.Everyone is good in this movie. Other than the effects nothing is thoroughly spelled out for you. It's up to you to figure out just what happened off screen. Something they also don't do anymore. Everything is now hammered into your head.The scariest things are what your own mind comes up with when posed with a few facts and images. Sometimes it's scarier when you don't see the monster. This film really couldn't of done this with respect to the monster but it did make use of that concept elsewhere. Even though it's kinda like Invasion of the Body Snatchers. It works better this time knowing what the monster's ghastly intentions and forms are. Instead of the "don't get caught "(sleeping or awake) mentality of Body Snatchers, The Thing's mentality is best summed up by the original story's title "Who goes there", which I recommend reading.Great line from the movie."You gotta be **cking kidding."Note: Buy this on DVD, it has got to be one of the most comprehensive and feature packed DVDS out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is considered one of the best horror films I have ever seen. I strongly recommend it for those who crave on scary movies.The special effects were great although the plot was typical, a group of people (scientists) isolated in a confined area and trapped with the alien .

		<shortDescription>You feel alive when you watch this movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just to have mentioned it, I'm up to double digit numbers when counting the number of times I've let myself become a part of this movie. To me it's a classic, maybe not due to the story, maybe not because it isn't the best movie ever made (maybe Lost Highway is?) but because of the embodying atmosphere Carpenter creates, the way he tells this simple story, the way it doesn't fully scare you, but the way it makes you feel... alive.Carpenter's The Thing is a true masterpiece in a way you are left to appreciate yourself, you may like to delve and criticise such things as the plot and characters, or you can simply not say anything about it. I love the atmosphere in this movie, the slow pace of the movie, from the start... the music, the ice, the snow, the cold yet comfortable air, the atmosphere that so surrounds you, the whole from the start to the limit of infinity, to the end. The still dense music that puts you in a mood (if you allow yourself) that makes the whole movie so perfect. Just feel relaxed.Carpenter might not be true to Campbells novel, but then again isn't the novel a story of an immense yet subtle threat to humanity, and isn't Carpenters movie that too? While the heart of the novel lies in the conversations between the scientists at a polar research station, their suspicions, their fear, fear of each other, fear of the entity... the alien... their dwellings on what it is, it's nature, why it acts like it does... and while Campbells novel is a storywise and storytellingwise original masterpiece (out of which infinitely many clones have come, storywise as well as storytellingwise, Campbell - as we all know - started the Golden Era in the 30's of science fiction novel's, the era during which Asimov, Simak, Heinleinen, Clark and the others released either some of their first or some of their best novel's, all of which somehow went over to Campbells premise of not writing science fiction stories of galaxy sized fights with heroes throwing planets at each other, but stories with a content, a premise, an atmosphere...). Carpenter's movie has a story based up on the novel by Campbell, but Carpenter doesn't place the heart of the movie on the conversations between the scientists at the research station, the scientists do fear and focus their thoughts on what it is among them that is killing and why it does so, but Carpenter has cut up and reassembled the story and tells it his own way, and he does this by simple means... that so talks to you.Set on a research station (unclear what research is actually conducted there) surrounded by cold ice, cold snow... all through the movie one sits still, sometimes jumping up or trying to control ones eyes as an unexpected gross effect takes place (no computer animated effects, real - somewhat - cronenberg styled effects, heads falling, dripping of the bodies). Still all the time, at no time control over the movie is lost, the slow, the still.. lovely paced way of bringing forth the movie is never lost, things go quiet, brings you back, small things happen, all the time the fear returns as one does not know from where the entity, the thing, will attack next, you don't necessarily get truly scared (though some things might actually accomplish that, depends on who you are), but one does feel the tension, and as such lets the movie continue, all the while... the music plays... who goes there is truly what one wonders. It's still, it's cold, the music comes in and with the visuals builds up an atmosphere I've never found in any other movie. With atmosphere I simply mean atmosphere, what is the atmosphere like in your room, still, dark, quiet..? That's atmosphere, not so fascinating being a part of the atmosphere in your room (unless one can manage to find some deep philosophical meaning with ones empty room, then it can become fascinating, but that's to noone but yourself), but being there, being a part of the air, the cold air, the icy snow covered lands, the loneliness.. the isolation and the threat... it's a thought that grows on you... scares you..I wish to avoid saying anything about the story, it's a science fiction movie, both horror/thriller suspense, but in the ground it is a movie with a story and an atmosphere that somehow talks greatly to me, not that I love the cold winter, but the stillness of the antarctic, the knowledge of the icy atmosphere, the mood, the dense - melting into - music, just helps bring this atmosphere, this movie alive...The story isn't simple, the threat is just such a well known threat, but never have the whole concept of an single entity, one single aliens threat to the whole of humanity, been filmed better...The Thing is, we don't know Who Goes There...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have owned this film on VHS for about 10 years so you can imagine how often I have watched it. Even when it is on TV I try to catch it. I first saw it around 1984 and was amazed that Carpenter had been allowed to kill all those people just to make a movie. You can't see the join! All the actors give stunning performances, notably Wilford Brimley (who never fails to impress) and Kurt Russell. This is the best thing Russell has done and I've seen nearly all his work (check out Soldier, another good performance).Carpenter is often attacked for the heavy bass music in his movies but it perfectly suits this film, reminiscent of a heartbeat. Rob Bottin should have got a knighthood for the SFX. Carpenter has captured the Antarctic landscape and it really makes you feel cold. This movie has so much going for it. It was the first sell-through VHS I ever bought &amp; I encourage you to do the same. A classic which is better than anything since.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(*=spoiler) Alright, here's the story. We are tortured to see a helicopter of crazy Norwegiens chasing after a cute little husky. They arrive at a base where Kurt Russel is stationed, and continue trying to kill this dog. Well, one thing leads to another, and the Norwegiens are dead. Kurt and crew take the dog into shelter, and go to the Norwegien camp to find out what's wrong. Horribly mutilated (and mutated) bodies are discovered. And then all hell breaks loose. I won't say anything more, except *the dog is not what it seems*. This film is incredibly scary in it's themes of isolation, paranoia, and incredibly disgusting (but entertaining) FX. One of the most tense scenes ever captured on film, where the crew's blood is checked, gives new meaning to this genre. And when the THING attacks, it's never who you think, what you think. It is the strangest damn thing made for the screen, with *opening chest cavities, heads splitting apart to reveal jaws, and heads popping off, growing spider legs*. I'm glad this movie was done before computers were big, because it would have looked crappy with them. If you have a tough stomach, just watch it. You'll see. *** (*=spoiler)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never having seen the original, I can only comment on this movie based on its own merits. Which is ok, because it has many. First, the good. The movie has some incredibly suspenseful scenes, and I don't think I have seen any other movie where paranoia and fear of everyone else has been captured so successfully. Also, although inevitably we scream at the characters for doing something we consider stupid under the circumstances, most of the actions of people here make sense. The great ending has to be mentioned as well - though it may disappoint some, I feel it was very gutsy on the movie makers' part.The bad side of the movie has mostly to do with its age, which is showing. Although there are some genuinely creepy alien moments, most of the time it feels fake - the movie is much more successful in what it does not show us. The two computer sequences are laughable as well, the prediction program scene more so than the chess scene. But overall this is still an excellent movie, and I strongly recommend checking it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter makes a classic sci-fi movie even better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who knew in 1978 when we saw 1951's "The Thing" on a TV set in John Carpenter's "Halloween" that he would be remaking it 4 years later? "The Thing" was the last film in Carpenter's succession of theatrical hits ("Assault on Precinct 13", "Halloween", "Escape from New York", "The Fog", "Halloween II"). Since then, Carpenter has only gotten worse, with his newest release "Vampires" sucking REAL bad. But here, you see Carpenter at his peak, working in a claustrophobic isolated environment with a hopeless situation. The best thing about the movie are the special effects by Rob Bottin, who had done an excellent job with "The Howling" a year earlier. The movie takes no time kicking into gear, with a graphic dog mutation setting the standard for what to expect in the next few hours. The highlight of the film is a soldier's head slipping away from his body and mutating into a spider!!! Now that the film has been re-released on video and DVD in a gorgeous widescreen print with long-lost footage, a whole new generation can enjoy the terror that is "John Carpenter's The Thing"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw The Thing, I was about 8 years old (Shame Mother!!!). I remember I couldn't even survive watching this past the Dog imitation scene. Several years later, (now 19 years old) I have bought the DVD. I can tell you this DVD is amazing, down from the documentary to the cool comentary with J.C and Kurt Russell. I am not ashamed to admit that this film still manages to scare me, and ranks up on the list with Alien, Aliens and Halloween. I must mention that I am a huge fan of J.C. I do appreciate his recent films, but not as much as his earlier ones. I must also commend the amazing Rob Bottin. He is a true gem in the movie world and his special make up effects still stand up to today's standards. But J.C's direction is absolutely amazing. He truly manages to capture the horror in Antarctica, it's as if we are actually trapped in this desolate ice world with these twelve men. You are transfixed in a claustrophobic and untrustworthy situation, where the pace is relentless. The Blood testing scene still manages to get my heart pounding through my chest. Cudo's also to J.C for not giving us a "Happy Ending", because that is the format most Hollywood films go for. ****Spoiler*****I love the bravery of MacReady and Childs for preventing The Thing from escaping by sacrificing their own lives****End Spoiler***** - Truly remarkable! If MacReady walked off in the mist like a lone cowboy (As J.C puts it) and lives happily ever after, that would suck. The ending of Alien worked so much, because Ripley survived the Alien, but was nonetheless left alone in space (with her cat) to sleep.Make sure you buy this DVD and relish in the John Carpenters remarkable masterpiece, along with Halloween. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it was on TV around 83. I was 9 or 10 at the time. I remember it scared the hell out of me. I wouldn't let kids watch it, even today. Some older horror movies were done so badly that you can really tell its fake. This movie is nearly 20 years old and it looks good today.If you have a DVD player, get that version of it! It is not cheap, but worth every cent. DVD includes FULL commentary from Carpenter and Russell, and there is a LONG behind-the-scenes interview with the film crew. Rob Bottin (special effects) tells how he did almost every scene. It is AMAZING how he did it. Even after he tells you, then you see the scene, it still looks real.Other things in the DVD are LOTS of extra pictures, the movie trailer, history of the movie, step-by-step frames and unused clips of the main monster, deleted scenes, and they even included some stills for a few scenes that were never filmed, but were planned!If you are a fan of the movie, even if you don't have DVD, get the DVD version, because when you do get it, you'll love it!This movie has all the key parts to make it a true horror flick. It's dark, chilling, suspenseful, jump out of your seat, and extremely gory. If you have a weak stomach, don't watch this when you're eating.If you like older horror flicks and love gore, this is it. Out of dozens of horror movies I've seen, NONE have came close to the gross out special effects in this movie.No holds are barred. Definitely NOT for the kids.If you can't own it, rent it. You'll be glad you did. It ranks right up there with Alien and Aliens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best monster movie of the last 20 years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's only serious competition for that claim to fame is the undoubtable "Aliens," which has to be the most imitated monster flick for the last two (and the trend seems to be continuing) decades. Unfortunately, that makes Aliens a bit hard to swallow nowadays (although, that one remains J.Cameron's best work). With everything else being a 'Jaws' retread, 'The Thing' is a bit refreshing, using a plot line that isn't done much anymore, even with its over the top effects--an isolated, spooky bump-in-the-night story. Carpenter does a delicious job of presenting enough shadows, questions, and uncertainty to capture the effect. The acting is top-notch, with every character a level deeper then caricature. But clearly, what everyone remembers is the best special effects scenes ever made, and stand-up incredibly well today. The Thing also is a credible point in the war against CGI effects: imagine those gooey episodes today, with fake-o looking CGI, for example, as in 'The Faculty,' and you can see how the animatronics and latex still are the most credible looking effects that can be used in a film.'The Thing' wouldn't be even close to successful with CGI.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of the best filmmakers have used the horror genre as a vehicle to talk about cultural issues. With the possible exception of Don Seigel in "Invasion of the Body Snatchers", no film has ever done this more successfully than John Carpenter's remake of "The Thing."This film is the best cinematic examination ever of alienation and paranoia. Based on John W. Campbell's classic novella "Who Goes There?", Carpenter maroons a group of scientists at a polar outpost, and then plunks a murderous shape-shifting alien down among them. Since the alien can look like anyone, the rapidly dwindling group comes to realize that no one can trust anyone else. Kurt Russell gives a strong performance as the station's helicopter pilot. He is ably supported by Wilford Brimley, T.K. Carter, and Donald Moffatt, who stand out among the supporting cast. Carpenter returns to the kind of ambiguity at the end of the film which made the last scene of "Halloween" so powerful.This movie was made in a different era than the Howard Hawks version; it's not surprising that it carries different baggage, and aims to transmit a completely different message. While both versions are worth watching, this one is far scarier, both on the "gross-out" and the psychological level.</fullReview>

Halfway into the movie we get that paranoid, cabin feverish feel when the researchers realize the horrible truth.

		<fullReview>John Carpenter's remake of "The Thing" is without a doubt, one of the scariest films ever to grace the silver screen! I remember watching the original version of "The Thing" and it managed to make me jump a few times. Although it still has maintained the qualities of a legitimate artistic sci-fi film, some of the "creep-out" factors have now aged into silliness. As for the new version of "The Thing", it's not here to make us feel comfortable. It's here to scare the living shit out of us! What scares me more than anything is not the creature itself, who plays a constant game of hide and go seek with the other crew members of the research team, but the suspense. The idea of a creature being able to recreate a perfect duplicate of another living creature was bad enough. But when things started to get out of control, and nobody knew who was who, if they were a person or a thing, then it got really scary. It was very paranoid, like you couldn't trust anybody except yourself. In some moments, the characters look as if they can't trust themselves either. Worst of all it's set in Antarctica, the coldest, loneliest place on the face of the planet. It's like an alien world, a perfect place for an alien creature to live. The creature is an incredible creation of design and special effects. I liked it because it seemed like a walking germ, that had no definite shape. We never knew what it was going to look like. Better still, I won't spoil it for those who have not seen it, but lets just say that the fear and terror of the film is not resolved or finished even when the end credits are rolling! And oh, that theme music that plays over and over again, brings the creep-out factor to it's peak. It's a real tour de force of suspense, terrifying images and special effects, which are used sparingly so as to not turn the film into a mindless special effects bonanza. This makes the old version of "The Thing" look like a comedy by comparison. Even on a standard television set, the creep-out factor is never lost. If your looking for a great scare that won't leave you, this is it. It's groundbreaking!</fullReview>

Paranoia, isolation, terror, and hopelessness all mixed into one film, with a superb cast, spectacular special effects, and a haunting score make this one of the best films of all time. I have seen this movie about 40 times, and it still holds me every time. The monologue given by MacReady (Kurt Russell) halfway through the film, into the tape recorder, is one of those scenes that you always remember. John Carpenter has made some magnificent films in his career (Halloween, They Live, Escape From New York, etc), but this one stands above them all.

See how Carpenter misdirects us into believing that the threat is in one direction when it is in quite another. What more could we want from a horror film?The blood test sequence has gone down as the most suspenseful scene in the film, but there are any number of creepy shocks awaiting the unwary viewer.

		<fullReview>One of the best and most frightening horror-movies ever made. Clearly one of the 10 best on a horror-film-list. Everything works here, good actors, creepy atmosphere, creepy locations, scary scenes and a really good plot. I remember I saw this on cinema when I was only 14 year old, and I thought is was frightening as hell. I have seen it on video many times after that and I still think it's a frightening movie.

		<fullReview>"I don't know who to trust?" "I know, trusts a difficult thing to come by these days...maybe you should just trust in the lord." This exchange between Wilford Brimley and Kurt Russell offers a succinct view of the alienation present in this sci-fi gem. Forget any gore or special effects...this movie concentrates on man's alienation. Each character is alone. The fear that your neighbor may be the horrible "Thing" permeates all actions. Watch the film with this in mind!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carpenter's remake is one of the most underrated horror films of all time. It's well directed, with creepy music and bleak settings giving the viewer a strong sense of the isolation these characters are feeling. It's genuinely suspenseful, with excellent special effects. Kurt Russel and Keith David are solid heroes, and the whole film moves quickly and efficiently towards a great ending. (Only the abrupt final showdown leaves something to be desired)The "blood test" and "crawling head" scenes are the highlights. Genuine shocks and knockout effects.I was surprised to discover that this film apparently bombed when it came out. (I was 11, and remember wanting to see it) Since good horror films are so few and far between, I can't believe people didn't respond well to it. Glad to see that now it's getting the respect it deserves.8 out of ten. One of JC's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes certain movies just "hit the spot"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To say that John Carpenter's "The Thing" is an achievement in the art of production design mixed with down right coolness is a MAJOR understatement.Some films just have an interesting and refreshing take on things and this film is certainly unique in that respect. It follows and reproduces the whole "Who Goes There" story as seen in films such as Alien and to a lesser extent Aliens, but because the Thing has no shape it becomes a psychological issue instead of diluting into a monster movie. Not to say that "The Thing" doesn't rely on gore or cheap scares to entertain - it does. But that isn't central to the story. It also walks the very fine line of being pretentious, but doesn't fall over the edge. Watch the blood test scene and tell me that it is not one of the finest pieces of ensemble drama ever put on film. 'Nuff said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 1951 Original Vs The 1982 Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel it is appropriate to use John W. Campbell Jr.'s 1938 novella, "Who Goes There?", as a baseline by which to compare the two films that strived to bring it to the screen; that is, "The Thing(From Another World)" released in 1951, and "The Thing" released in 1982. Keep in mind that I consider Campbell's tale one of the best sci-fi horror stories ever written, and that it would be quite a feat to successfully adapt it to cinema. The 1951 film, directed by Christain Nyby, deviated so much from the story that it is difficult to draw many parallels between the two. In the story, the alien is a 4 ft tall being with three red eyes, rubbery,blue,wormlike hair and multiple razor- sharp tentacles. This alien "chameleon" is so intelligent that its species figured out long ago how to imitate any living creature through DNA duplication and replication. This uncanny, insidious imitation extended to the personality and mind of it's victims. The end of the story further highlights its superior intellect by featuring a strap-on anti-gravity device powered by a small atomic generator that it had built within the mere span of one week by scrounging spare parts at the compound - coiled wires, radio tubes, coffee-tins, glass, magnets, leather and cloth belts, etc. The alien was killed before it could make it's escape and eventually imitate the living composition of the entire planet! In the 1951 film version, the alien is portrayed as an 8 ft tall hairless Frankenstein-like humanoid, with flesh of a vegetable- like quality which needed blood to reproduce itself through seedpods. The film is standard horrorfare, with the expedition crew uniting together to fight and destroy the alien menace, which they eventually did, via electrocution. The alien is not characterized as particularly intelligent, rather as a rampaging, blood-thirsty monster; making it hard to imagine such a brute was advanced enough to participate in interstellar travel. So while, "The Thing(From Another World) featured excellent direction, acting, dialogue, score and so forth under the watchful eye of producer/shadow director, Howard Hawks, I feel he took artistic license and deviated too much from Campbell's story. There was suspense and terror to be sure, but it lacked the pervasive paranoia that Campbell conveyed so well in "Who Goes There?" In sharp contrast, director John Carpenter's 1982 version, "The Thing", both brilliantly captures the alien's insidious chameleon-like powers (through Rob Bottin's effects) and the paranoia it induced amongst the expedition's crew. Instead of bonding together as a cohesive unit as in the 1951 film, to fight a readily discernable foe, they fragmented in the face of a remarkably cunning enemy capable of imitating any one of them; they become deeply suspicious and paranoid of one another as any of them could be the alien in disguise, and they literally ask, "is it really you, WHO GOES THERE?"; echoing the name of the novella's title. This situation runs counter to classic character development, as how could anyone be stable and well-defined with their core-identity as such risk? Who's who? who's the good guy? bad guy? Perhaps a little unsettling to viewers and critics. I think this film has received a battering from movie critics because they were weaned on relishing a steady, inexorable buildup of suspense and an inevitable resolution. However, in "The Thing", this suspense is permeated with a claustrophobic paranoia and sullen dread, generating an atmospheric ambiguity - something the critics weren't comfortable with, hence, rejected. Combine this ambiguity with the critic's aversion to the graphic special effects, wholly appropriate to the storyline, but misinterpreted by them as "gratuitous violence and gore", then one understands why "The Thing" got butchered in the reviews. Here, as in the Campbell story, MacReady is the acknowledged hero, even before he tested himself as human, for we instinctively knew he would be. However, in the story, MacReady, with the aid of several genuinely human crewmembers, kills the alien and in doing so, literally saves the planet. Whereas, in the 1982 film, MacReady, valiant as he is, just isn't powerful enough to stop the alien. Thus, the open-ended ending; the lack of closure being a disappointment to me; I immediately thought "sequel", but have yet to see one. Also, keep in mind that in the story, the alien starts and ends with his original form, whereas in the 1982 film, the alien never has a definitive original form, being relatively amorphous throughout. In the final analysis, I like both of these films, in spite of their shortcomings; namely, the 1951 film's failure to adhere closely to the story, thereby failing to capture the essence of the imitative alien and paranoid atmosphere it generated; and the 1982 film's failure to remain faithful to the story's optimistic ending. Actually, both films stand up fairly well when referenced to Campbell's chilling tale, and even better when viewed as stand-alones. One thing is for sure, both films have earned a secure place in my video collection.</fullReview>

Kurt Russell is great in the lead role and the rest of the cast is perfect. John Carpenter uses lighting and music to develop nice moods and textures. I've seen this film at least 100 times, it isn't perfect in some ways, but I've neverminded that at all. It's a pure horror film with great special effects from Rob Bottin and great lighting by Dean Cundey. I think Carpenter should get back to this type of horror film, it really is his strength as a director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's rare to find a horror film that is equal parts terror, suspense, humor, claustrophobia, and all-out gore. Even more rare is to find a film with all those elements that is actually GOOD. Well, rejoice, horror fans. John Carpenter did it again. In much the same way that he created the slasher film with Halloween, he has created a truly powerful science fiction film with elements of horror that have since become commonplace in films and even on television (see any episode of the X-Files). John Carpenter's attention to character is unwavering in this story, making the impending doom that much more horrifying. The unique ending must be credited to both the writer and to John Carpenter's knack for endings that don't really end. In short, The Thing is well worth any true horror or science fiction fan's time, as long as you have the stomach.</fullReview>

Ennio Morricone's simple yet eerie musical score is also a big asset by adding to the tension.The film has many memorable scenes from the dog's gooey transformation, the guy's stomach turning into teeth and chomping off the doctor's arms and the severed head that grows legs and scuttles across the floor. Now come on, what other movie alien has ever done that?!I first saw this film on T.V. about five years ago and I remember being astounded by what I was seeing. I have seen it at least ten times since and it still gets to me everytime.Very much a science-fiction/horror classic - it's a shame that Mr Carpenter went downhill after this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Thing" will never be on my list of favorite movies, but I thought it was not bad. Never saw the original, but the remake was pretty good. Good plot (for once), having crash-landed aliens take over humans at an Antarctic outpost. Then it is a race against time for Kurt Russell and the rest of the cast to find out who is still humans, and who is "the thing". Special effects are at times nauseating, but appropriate to the plot. This movie carries the same effect at the end as "Halloween" and "Carrie". I note, for once, not all of the African-American cast members die during the movie. I have not seen many other action or sci-fi movies where this is the case. (With the exception of Die Hard and the Lethal Weapon series.)Rating: 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know... It isn't "the Bicycle Thief", or "Citizen Kane", but minute for minute, i gather more enjoyment from The Thing than either of those masterpieces. This movie grabs you from the first scene and takes you far away from your warm cozy living room, and blankets you in cold isolation. I find myself curious about the people who find themselves stationed in that far corner of the world. Carpenter never tells us anything about them, which gives us a voyeuristic feel. Great special effects and a good plot move the story along. The tension builds unceasingly as you slowly realize that all of the people in this film are doomed. The DVD version is a must own, It has so many extras that it is like getting another film free. And the color and sound are vastly improved over the video version ( yes, I own both). I watch this movie at least once a month, and have since the mid 80's . If that makes me obsessive, so be it.</fullReview>

I had seen C.H.U.D., a couple of Nightmare on Elm Streets, and even a Friday the 13th or so, but not a single one of them had scared me. This film changed that (to this day). This is the only film to have put a little fright into me. Back when you had to think of special effect (instead of having one guy with a vivid imagination, and 124 computer geeks-like today) this film maximises a lot out of a little. A great story, good acting, and a satisfied customer - three things that rarely go together when discussing horror films.</fullReview>

The script doesn't even bother to offer the hope of an out - the characters are doomed and they know it. In some ways, that makes it a better movie than Alien: there's no escape pod and little expectation that the beautiful woman will get killed. Like the Alien crew, these people aren't paid to confront the unknown, or really know or care anything about it. It's better than the original, which I never found that interesting anyway.</fullReview>

Kurt is the another strength of this movie. Like Snake Pilsken, MacReady is also a hard -ass, but when the thing comes with the basic objective: to rule the world, Kurt become a victim. And you too. The movie has its tagline: Man is the warmest place to hide. And you have also one: at night there's no place to hide. Good night!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a great horror movie at the time it was released and today it is still a very good film. This would make a wonderful sequel providing John Carpenter doesn't lose touch with what he's doing. For instance, Escape from LA was almost a spoof in comparison to the original movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter's The Thing is a Masterpiece (full stop)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So initially I wrote this (kind of) short review:Though I love E.T. (also at the time) The Thing was the thing for me, absolutely 100% Where E.T. today feels more like a Muppet Show (the plastic like E.T. is no longer as believable has he was in the 80s) The Thing still holds up against time in a rare and wonderful all men cast and a Kurt Russell playing chess with a computer, having a long strong drink when needed. This is a man's and a big boy's movie. And for this reason alone no man should ever miss out on this film.Maybe John Carpenter felt under pressure and had a hard time making it (so I read somewhere). But looking back there is no doubt in my mind, now as then, that The Thing is a wonderful Masterpiece (big thumbs up from me).And that was the review?But IMDb need more words to accept a review, so therefore I will continue:When The Thing first came out I was already the biggest John Carpenter fan ever on planet Earth. So no wonder that I went for the first screening a Friday at 12:00 noon at the (at that time) second biggest screen in Copenhagen, Denmark (Palads cinema screening room 1). Dolby Stereo was still a new thing back then and when the film faded up in a hand held panoramic wide shot of the cold ice at the South Pole together with the heartbeat drum of Ennio Morricone the tense atmosphere was set and ready. I knew from the first twenty seconds of the film that I was about to watch a Masterpiece and I also knew that I wasn't going to be disappointed? If you have never watch The Thing and there is a given chance (somehow) that you in the near future of your short life will have the chance to watch this Masterpiece on a big screen in a cinema, you should wait for this option rather than watching it on DVD or whatever digital media you can find. That is if you want to experience the initially Oomph that this film's first scene brings to its audience?In any regards all big boys and men should see this MAN FILM !!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A US research station, Antarctica, early-winter 1982. The base is suddenly buzzed and attacked by a helicopter from the nearby Norwegian research station. They appeared to be trying to kill one of the dogs from the US base. Having dealt with the threat, the members of the US team fly to the Norwegian base, only to discover them all dead or missing. They do find the remains of a strange creature the Norwegians burned. The Americans take it to their base and deduce that it an alien life form. After a while it is apparent that the alien can take over and assimilate into other life forms, including humans, and can spread like a virus. This means that anyone at the base could be inhabited by The Thing, and tensions escalate.A horror classic. A well crafted story, directed by horror legend John Carpenter. He builds the plot well, meticulously setting the scene and ramping up the tension with good effect. The period where anyone could be infected / inhabited is particularly suspenseful. Excellent special effects, especially for 1982. Very gory, imaginative and realistic. Some of the images from the movie are quite iconic and will be familiar from pop culture, they've been reused so much.Ending is maybe a bit too ambiguous for my liking. While I don't generally like neat, happy Hollywood endings, this possibly went too much in the opposite direction. A greater degree of closure, or at least an indication of where the story was heading, was in order, I think.Solid performances all round. Kurt Russell is particularly good in the lead role, playing the quick-thinking action hero very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Masterpiece of Horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter is always my favorite directer with along with Guillemo Del Toro, Stephen Norrington and Fritz Lang. The Thing is an great movie that ever made in 1982 and still had it today. The Thing is a first movie in the Apocalypse Trilogy, which continued with Prince Of Darkness and ended with In the Mouth of Madness.The Thing is widely regarded as one of John Carpenter's greatest masterpieces, and I would personally consider it a contender for the title of the best horror film ever made. It didn't always receive such a rosy reception, though. It was released in theaters just weeks after Steven Spielberg's much more blockbuster-friendly E.T., and its theatrical performance and initial critical reception weren't anything to write home about, the movie had became a beloved cult classic over the years.The movie is a remake from 1951 The Thing From Another and was directed by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby and adapted from a John W. Campbell short story; however, implicit Lovecraft allusions abound.The Thing. The story concerns an alien creature found frozen in Antarctic ice that can absorb, digest, and then imitate perfectly any creature that it comes into contact with. What follows from its discovery is a classic meditation on paranoia, punctuated by some of the best practical special effects ever put on film. The Thing is a remake of the 1951 Howard Hawks film The Thing from Another World, which was itself based on a short story by John W. Campbell called "Who Goes There?"Once it is revealed, the titular Thing is almost entirely unknowable. Not only is it alien in the most literal sense, but it's also outside of normally understood biology, genetically dissimilar from all life on earth. When discussing how the Thing can do what it does, or how it can live after being frozen for so long, one of the characters (played by Kurt Russell) says, "Cuz it's different than us, see. Cuz it's from outer space." And that's about all the more understanding of its reasoning the characters ever get. Though the creature can obviously speak perfectly when it is imitating one of the humans, it never explains itself.The Movie is awesome in every way with an strong story, great actors and with great special effects. If you a john carpenter fan (just like i am) this movie is perfect for a horror movie night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who can you trust?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What fuels "The Thing" is a feeling more than an idea. After establishing the characters and the premise that any one of their colleagues could be an alien impersonator, the plot takes a predictable line, as character after character's humanity is tested. But what kept me engaged was feeling the need for a community. Kurt Russell's MacReady maps out the lay of the land for us, but then needs to determine who he can trust. Poor judgment here could be fatal. His methodology to determine who is human and who is not is simple, but we soon learn that the answer always changing. An ally now may try to kill you an hour later. A great theme given today's political struggle to accept refugees while faced with an attitude of xenophobia. Considering the "aliens-as-us" premise, Carpenter sketches out the characters well, and they are convincing, given the extreme circumstances of the story. Although the pre-CGI special effects may seem dated now, they are still effective and make your skin crawl. I recommend this to a new generation of moviegoers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Childs: "I just cannot believe any of this voodoo bullshit."Palmer:"Childs, happens all the time, man. They're falling out of the skies like flies. Government knows all about it, right, Mac?" John Carpenter's The Thing really is something else and I can't even imagine how impressed I would've been if I was there to watch it when it came out. There's a reason why The Thing is praised by many critics and considered to be one of the best Horror movies ever. It's visually repulsive, in a good way, thanks to the isolated setting in Antarctica, fantastic make-up and practical effects. In fact, this may be my favourite Horror movie ever based on practical effects. Personally, I prefer practical effects over CGI. A good combination of both works as well. The Thing remains complete as both a Horror and Sci-Fi movie.Besides being eye candy, the paranoia caused between the researchers is something well executed. It's by no means deeply layered or complex. In fact, it's rather straightforward but just like the researchers you try to focus and pay attention to all the little details as you're trying to figure things out for yourself. Each scene made me wonder: "What would I do in this situation", which is something I happen to like. It's safe to say that there were no holds barred when it came to imagination. To top it all off, you have Kurt Russell, which takes a sip of his bottle of J&amp;B every couple of minutes, and some cheesy but acceptable dialogue. The Thing will forever remain an iconic piece of work, no matter how much the movie industry transforms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best practical effects ever in a horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thing is a masterpiece of suspense and gore. It's about paranoia, and there's plenty to be paranoid of in this movie. Is the man standing next to you a man, or an imitation? Will he suddenly burst from his skin and attack you? the whole theme of who's who pervades the entire movie, and it's just great. You gotta watch it. It is without a doubt Special effects master Rob Bottin's greatest work. It's amazing what people came up with before computers replaced almost everything with CGI. All the monsters are real, in the sense that everything you see on screen is really there. So real in fact that even though it was made in 81-82, they still look better than everything today, even 30+ years later. this is my favorite horror movie of all time. The cast is great, the direction is fantastic, the score is absolutely creepy and memorable. I watched The Hateful 8 recently and recognized some of the music from this movie straight away. I didn't even know it was the same composer. All in all this movie is a classic that will still hold up in another 30 years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of the best horror starts with an isolated environment. A Cabin in the woods (Evil Dead), a boat harassed by a giant shark with no land in sight (Jaws) and so on. This time it's a research team trapped by a blizzard in Antarctica with no hope of rescue.Kurt Russell is brilliant in this. This movie is decades old, but hasn't aged one day. The visual fx in it are nothing short of astounding and Carpenter's atmospheric music finally adds to the film instead of causing a distraction as it usually does. Of all his film, this is apparently John Carpenter's favorite. Watch this movie and you'll see why. It's my favorite of his too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter's The Thing(1982)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's The Thing, Is a film about an Ice station research team in the Antarctic during the first week of Winter. The film opens with a scene with a Dog being chased by a Norwegian Helicopter pilot and passenger shooting at it. After accidentally blowing up the helicopter, the remaining Norwegian begins to follow the dog into the American base until the dog is saved by the American group, Who believe the Norwegian team have gone crazy. Upon being moved into the kennel, the dog begins to mutate into a disturbing creature that attacks the other dogs, we soon find out that this Alien has the ability to change it's appearance of anyone it assimilates. This leaves us with a group of characters unable to trust each other, as they are being picked off one by one, and replaced by the Thing. As the group begins to learn that this creature is of Alien origin the doubt and mistrust begins to further set in. The group Is lead by McCready(Kurt Russell), who takes charge of the situation, his unwillingness to let the Thing go free, and suspicions towards everybody, begins to breed mistrust and paranoia, towards the the group. Whilst on the other hand the group aren't sure whether he could be the Thing and trying to deliberately fracture the group. The film is directed by John Carpenter and was his first big studio film after having previous critical and commercial success with Halloween(1978), and Escape From New York(1981). The film ended up doing badly at the box office not even making it's budget back, and had a critical backlash, although not aided at the time by going up against Steven Spielberg's family friendly E.T(1982). Carpenter directs this film with expert craftsmanship the film is incredibly well shot, with scenes that are genuinely horrific, and scary. It's also helped by the cinematography of long time collaborator Dean Cundey(Halloween), that gives it the sense of dread and paranoia which seeps through the film, from the first opening shot too it's hauntingly ambiguous ending. The film should be praised for it's excellent use practical effects, that still hold up incredibly well today and creates some of the most disturbing creature designs in cinema history. The score by Ennio Morricone, is brooding and adds another layer of depth, and tension.John Carpenter's The Thing pulls no punches, and asks the viewer to have a strong stomach, it also asks us to keep our eyes open at all times for even the slightest clue as to who might be The Thing. It is also a film filled With characters that we care about, which few Horror films have done in the past decade. The Thing is a film that will be discussed as a classic in the Horror genre for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thing is directed by John Carpenter, has a screenplay by John Lancaster, is based on the novel Who Goes There? by John W. Campbell Jr, has music by Ennio Morricone and stars Kurt Russell, Richard Dysart, Keith David, Wilford Brimley, T.K Carter, Peter Maloney, Thomas G. Waites, Richard Masur, Joel Polis and Donald Moffatt.Carpenter's film is a remake of the 1951 film The Thing From Another World an adaptation of Campbell's story. The fifties film does an excellent job of portraying the isolation of the team and their fear but it lacks the terror and realistic special effects of this remake. The Thing is a bleak horror film, there is no happy ending to be found here and in places it is a tough film to watch.Antarctica, 1982 a Norwegian helicopter flies over an American science base. It becomes apparent that the two men on board are chasing after a husky that has run into the camp, they are shooting at it and trying to blow it up. The American commander thinking the base is being attacked kills one of the crew and the other is killed when the helicopter is blown up. It is not clear why they wanted to kill the husky and the team think they must have gone crazy from the isolation at their base. The husky is put in with the Americans dogs.The American's pilot MacReady (Kurt Russell)and the teams doctor Dr.Copper(Richard Dysart)fly to the neighbouring Norwegian science base and what they discover there terrifies them. The base is destroyed and they find some dead bodies including something that looks half human and half something else. They bring it back to the base and try and find out what it is. They conclude it's alien (a suspicion that's confirmed when they look at some tapes they found at the Norwegian base), these show that team digging a spaceship out from under the ice and recovering an alien from the craft.The husky that was being chased is the alien and has taken on the appearance of the husky. When it's in the kennels it transforms and tries to assimilate the other dogs into itself. That's prevented by the team when they hear the disturbance and then everyone comes to realise they are being threatened by an alien. The film really becomes scary when they realise that this thing could have assimilated one or more of them and someone in the team may not be human after all. The team no longer knows if they can trust one another or not and have to try and uncover the alien among them.The entire cast are superb especially Russell as the heroic Macready. Wilford Brimley is also memorable as the scientist who realises that the team can't in all good conscience leave the base because they could take the thing back to civilisation and it could infect the population.Ennio Morricone's chilling score that sounds like a heartbeat really adds to the horror atmosphere and the special effects help make the story realistic. As with Alien (1979)not using computer effects but physical things that the actors can interact with and that look real gives the film a realistic look. You get scared because what you're seeing looks so real.The films ambiguous ending and realistic effects have no doubt helped the film achieve the fame it has today and both are quite the talking point. The Thing is one of the best horror films ever made and is a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very late to the party in terms of seeing this movie. I had only recently seen John Carpenter's original Halloween as well. That being said, this movie still blew me away. For a movie that came out in 1982, nothing in the film seems dated and every scare is genuine and effective. Kurt Russel is as engaging as ever as R.J. MacReady and the rest of the cast also do a great job as an ensemble. Furthermore, this may also be John Carpenter's best movie overall. It's a tough call with other films like Halloween, They Live, or Big Trouble in Little China in his filmography but it is definitely up there. Despite all the impressive aspects of the movie previously mentioned, the greatest part of this film that easily holds a candle to it today are the special effects. The makeup and effects are astonishing and possibly some of the best of all time. Pair these effects with a simple but effective score and you get some substantial scares that still work today.Overall, The Thing is easily one of my favorite horror movies of all time. The only one that comes close for me is The Shining. The Thing also includes one of the best movie monsters ever and is a horror classic that can be watched over and over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is very suspenseful. A nail biter. It reminded me of the Alien movies: an isolated group of people with little to no outside communications, and little to no way of escaping. All they can do is track the thing(ha). There was a keen sense of very rightful paranoia. As you see, this thing, is a chameleon, and could be anyone or more than one.There's lots of gory grossness, and may even be scary to some people. I mainly found it suspenseful. What's missing, is well, a Ripley. Or any female for that matter. The entire cast is male. Mmmn, I could overlook that, but kept feeling a lack of something, and I think that was it.It has a great little track of a suspenseful sound effect, almost like a heartbeat slowed down and with the pitched changed. All the acting was very good. The ending was a little disappointing. I don't know if they were setting up for a sequel, or the director wanted to leave it mysterious. I would have preferred a more defined ending.I just watched it for the first time, and for 1982, it has held up very well. If you like the Alien movies I think you will definitely like this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Right Movie at the wrong time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the mid 70s into the early 80s, John Carpenter was making a great name for himself doing independent films such as Assault on Precinct 13, Halloween, The Fog, and Escape from New York. It was only a matter of time when a big studio was going to jump on the "JC" wagon. In comes John Carpenter's Thing. His most ambitious project possibly to date. The movie was amazing, although it was loosely...key word loosely, a remake, you wouldn't even notice. It's a completely different beast from the 1950's version. It plays more on the tension of atmosphere, betrayal, mistrust, oh and really remarkable special effects for it's time. Just one problem.... It came out a week after Steven Spielberg's E.T. The thing was unfortunately a flop at the box office. If only it were release at a different time, I think it would have really boosted up John Carpenter's career greater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While "The Thing" comes with a splendid and original plot accompanied by truly terrifying moments, its clunky execution harms its infamous reputation...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>------------- MY RATING: 68/100 -------------*CONTAINS SPOILERS!*"The Thing" is another classic horror film from the 80s. Unfortunately, it seems I am the only one who struggles with the 80s sci-fi movies...The plot is indeed an innovative one, an alien life form crashed on Earth 100.000 years ago is being discovered and revived by a Nordic research team in Antarctic. The alien functions on the cellular level with unknown original appearance and infects any life form and absorbs it to create a mutated combination of anything it absorbed so far and all that on multiple hosts. Being smart and adaptive, it can take one form at a time to imitate an ordinary organism and it seems it can even absorb memories and habits to adapt even further when it has taken a intelligent life form (ex. a human). The American research team will soon find out that the crazy Norwegian who chased for miles a dog wasn't that crazy and will have to come up with their own plan to survive when the discovery of the mutated form hits the plot."The Thing" does a great job scaring you under a confusing and unpredicted predicament. It's visual effects are great and horrifying and the disturbing "fade to black" scenes of the movie are hiding you what you need to know to keep yourself relaxed and "in control" of the plot.However, the movie is seriously hurt by multiple problems. While the plot is great, cinematography is mediocre and writing is clunky, convenient and unrealistic. Some examples:1) When the dog is led to the room with the other dogs we have great lighting. When the dog transforms and while the other dogs are screaming, one of the characters, in almost zero visibility and complete darkness, calmly opens the door only to realize that there is something horrible inside. As they burn the creature for 2 seconds with a flamethrower, the alien dies immediately and without any second thoughts they distinguish the fire and carry it without quarantine measures to examine it. Then, the doctor has a perfect super computer which can run cellular simulations and calculate the probabilities of infection.2) Throughout the movie and until the last minute, while it is more than clear to the dumbest that the creature strikes those who are separated, our characters are conveniently and stupidly separated all the time, making it extra easy for the creature to devour them. After the 7th time, it really gets annoying, massively downgrading the movie and making you build great frustration.3) Initially, the characters are not really surprised with the discovery, making you look more surprised, despite you are located in your safe sofa in the real world.4) While the characters are trying to save themselves individually and seem so selfish for the 3/4 of the movie, they unrealistically offer to burn down the entire complex and freeze to death in the end.5) The scene with the shark-stomach is voted as one of the most hilarious death scenes of all time and the spider head nearly makes its escape without any of the characters realize it, despite that thing was making noise and it was too big to leave unnoticed. And let's forget that it didn't simply run but waited to be killed by the flamethrower (again)!6) While the creature makes a full reveal in the end and was always devouring its victims immediately, it just stares at our protagonist growling, giving him enough time to use a dynamite to blow it up!All and all, the movie is classic with a great, original plot and truly disgusting horror scenes to shake your spine but the film itself will probably leave you more frustrated than scared.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deep in Antarctica a team of U.S scientists stumble upon an alien entity that can change it's physical form with those that it kills and assimilates. Terror and tension run high as the scientists band together to survive but the question remains who is truly who they are and who can be trusted?For its time The Thing was a grotesque and supremely frightening film. Its effects though seemingly aged are still terrifying for those who have not seen or do not know what to expect with this film. The feeling of isolation and suffocation grow with each passing min. of the film. The score of this film compliments that very real feeling of dread and suspense. Kurt Russell one of John Carpenters favorite cast-able actors does a terrific job as R.J. McReady, who seems to be the only one prepared for the terror that is The Thing. The fellow cast mates do a terrific job as well. Though some may argue that the effects have aged and what was once frightening now cheesy, but with a bit of suspended belief one can truly feel and see the films intention, to scare the hell out of you. Graphic and grotesque in its nature, and all done with physical effects which to me resonate a lot of charm and make the film a bit more real than just the standard CGI of today's film making techniques. The Thing is a must see for any fan of horror and sci-fi, if you can stomach it.</fullReview>

That movie approached it as more of a science fiction story than the horror movie that John Carpenter made.. While this 1982 version was not the exact same storyline, it took the premise of what the original offered then ran with it.. If you go back and look at the original what made it really stand out was the crisp and intelligent dialog that went on though out the movie.. The 1982 version seemed more like a bunch of cowboys on ice rather than intelligent beings and scientists battling a being from another world. Not to say that I didn't enjoy it but for me visual scares do not put fear into me as much as that of an unknown terror approaching. Carpenter's version had the visuals but for me lacked suspense and intelligence.</fullReview>

Nothing beats the old style special effects not a blue/green screen in sight! The performances churned out by an ordinary cast is brilliant and yes I'm saying it was an almost ordinary cast minus Kurt Russell Keith David (Childs)and possibly Donald Moffat (Garry)but you know what I mean. I remember watching this movie when I was 10 and then I definitely thought horror but as I've watched it progressively over the years each time I find myself classing it as something else sometimes even as a murder mystery! The setting works well and the film never seems to lack pace from a never ending twisting plot that keeps you guessing all the way to the end. If you've not seen it I don't know what you're waiting for. No really I don't know what are you waiting for go watch it now you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gore fest. Yet actually amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hidden gems are a beautiful thing. I'm writing this in hopes of exposing this amazing movie. I saw this on a list of the best horror movies of all time and it piqued my interest. I'm normally not a big horror fan because the acting and storyline are usually "Horrible" (ha ha). With this movie though, it's a much different story. This is the best role I've seen Kurt Russell do. He plays a leader of a group of people doing scientific expedition in the Antarctic. I think it's safe to say that there is some "Thing" on the loose. A monster that can imitate the form of any person or animal. This ability is reason why the film is so amazing. At any moment you don't know who is a thing or who is human. If you've ever played the party game Mafia you'll get a kick out of the situation.Throughout the movie the director builds suspense at a steady rate. By the end I was holding my breath to see what would happen to the main character. The gruesome deaths and the monster might be too much for some people. The Thing is essentially a giant pile of gore with tentacles. The special effects still hold up today. I was cringing in a couple of the scenes. This is one of the goriest films I've ever watched. You've been warned. The environment in the movie is a large research building in a remote snow filled area. It adds a lot of memorable atmosphere and ambiance. Near the end it gets dark outside the characters have to use flares to see and they can't go outside for a long time without risking freezing to death. The thing one the other hand only can survive in freezing temperatures, so the crew is at a big disadvantage. They try to burn him to death with flamethrowers, the keyword there is try. He is like a virus that you just can't get rid of. He is horrifying. I'd suggest watching this one after you've had plenty of life experience. Watch it too early and you're liable to be scared for life. Luckily I'm thoroughly desensitized by now.I'm telling you, if you have Netflix and don't mind some extreme gore watch this as soon as you can. You're in for an amazing experience. This is now my favorite horror movie of all time. I'd give this movie a 9/10.tkubas1.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect horror film, a modern day classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As we all know, usually remakes can be colossal bombs. Not so, "The Thing." Quite possibly John Carpenter's greatest film, I have watched this fantastic movie at least 50 times to date, largely because most of my friends have never seen it! While working on "Big Trouble in Little China" with the same director, I was prompted to ask him, straight out, why this film seemed to simply fall off the radar, and his answer was short and sweet: "Timing. I had the bad fortune of deciding to release 'Thing' at the same time that Steven Spielberg released "ET." The movie was simply buried under the onslaught of media attention that made ET a worldwide hit. But that fact doesn't undercut the sheer brilliance of this nail biting masterpiece of horror. Starting from the truly inspired casting, to the script, to the incredible monster making, to the cinematography, to even the stark, atmospheric soundtrack by the great Ennio Morricone, 'The Thing' has become the modern benchmark of sci fi/horror films to come, and John Carpenter deserves all the credit. First, the setting. Using an already claustrophobic location of a completely enclosed, totally isolated Arctic science lab outpost, inhabited by all that testosterone, was as an effective a place for a modern day horror flick as the spooky Gothic castle was in the classic of the genre, "Frankenstein," imparting as much of the feeling of dread as the story itself. But quite possibly the greatest plot choice in was in simply leaving the ending open, "and just wait and see what happens." Brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely well done character driven movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent movie, probably one of Kurt Russel's best, and certainly the best of John Carpenter's movies that I've seen.I'd always wondered why John Carpenter enjoys the movie making reputation he does, now I know why.The actors pull off spectacular performances, despite many being in extremely stereotypical roles.There is a delicious bit of irony about the whole plot structure that I don't know if is intentional. The movie begins with a group of Norwegians hunting The Thing from a helicopter. Obviously this fails as otherwise there would be no movie, but the irony is that in a way the Norwegians actually fared better against the creature than the protagonists of the movie do. They are in possession of a helicopter and are hunting the creature, while, by the end of the movie, the protagonists are waiting to die, uncertain as to whether they have succeeded in killing the alien.Probably the biggest failing of the movie is that you would think an intelligent, space-faring alien would be less of a kill everything monster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take ten guys (all on the raggedy edge), strand them in the middle of frozen nowhere and trap them with an alien monster that wants to replace them one by one . . . Hell of that isn't a surefire recipe for a kickass horror movie. And more than that, "The Thing" boasts a genuinely palpable sense of atmosphere, even from just the sound design alone. John Carpenter sows the seeds of mistrust early on and that feeling just compounds as the story unfurls. This is a masterpiece of paranoia. It's why, even after we get to a point when the effects no longer hold up (they still do), this will still be an intensely unnerving movie. Ballsy, too,a with that ambiguous ending (not to mention the fantastic closing line).Also, Kurt Russell and a flamethrower. This movie's operating on a whole other level! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visceral Sci-fi body-horror par excellence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the frozen emptiness of the Antarctic, a research team finds itself confronted with the very stuff of nightmares when a vicious parasitic alien life-form with the ability to assume the form of its victims is inadvertently awakened from its slumber under the ice.Often cited as a remake of the 1951 Sci-fi flick 'The Thing from Another World', Carpenter's film is really a more faithful adaption of the original source material of the short story 'Who Goes There' by John W. Campbell Jr., and is the first (and most accomplished) part in Carpenter's so-called 'Apocalypse Trilogy' - a loose collection of films whose only connection is a brooding atmosphere of impending doom (the other parts being the slightly disappointing 'Prince of Darkness' (1987) and the satisfying meta-fiction romp 'In the Mouth of Madness (1995)). In 'The Thing' the impending doom engendered by the presence of the parasitic alien is heightened by the setting of the remote icy wilderness and the piercing sense of growing isolation born from suspicion as it dawns on the members of the team what they are up against and that no-one can be trusted as any one of them may be the Thing. Oh, and not forgetting the brilliantly ominous score courtesy of Ennio Morricone! All this being said, the real stand out quality of 'The Thing' are the special effects: gloriously breaking the oft-repeated "leave-it-to-the-audience's-imagination" dictum 'The Thing' serves as an exemplary example that sometimes the audience's imagination ISN'T scarier than what's on screen. In fact, the sheer visceral body-horror of the effects in 'The Thing' would make David Cronenberg proud, and indeed one scene in particular makes the famed John Hurt chest-explosion sequence in 'Alien' (that other Horror Sci-fi masterpiece) look amusing and woefully amateur! High praise indeed, and the fact that all this is done without a jot of CGI makes it both a testament to the sheer ingenuity of the special effects department and a reprimanding finger-shake to all films that have lazily relied on such computer generated effects for their thrills.Bizarrely this film was a flop upon its initial release, but time generally stands as a good judge in these matters and 'The Thing' has rightly assumed a position as one of Carpenter's best films as well as one of the finest hybrids of horror and science fiction you are likely to find outside of the Nostromo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thing attacks with its gory visuals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that after seeing the three brilliant and scary interpretations of John W. Campbell's story 'Who Goes There?' ? 'The Thing from Another World', 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' and 'Alien' - I sat on my couch to watch 'The Thing' with a bit of skepticism. However, as I knew that John Carpenter is a cult director in the horror sphere, I was definitely ready for a good scare, filled with a decent level of blood and gore, and maybe not too much of a genuine story.The first thing that the viewer sees is a spaceship traveling in the galaxy near Earth. Fast- forward a few hundred years: Antarctica, exactly in the middle of nowhere. In the enormous amount of pure-white snow, we observe a helicopter coming in the distance, trying to shoot a dog. But why do they want to catch an innocent creature so badly? That we actually won't find out (yet?), as the dog runs towards an American station, and after a chaotic couple of minutes and a few gunshots (and dead Norwegians), it is finally safe in the arms of confused Americans.This is the moment when all the fun starts. It's like a game of cat and mice between the 'thing' (no one knows what it truly is, as it is able to morph and take shape of any organism that is nearby) and all the researches. This insatiable creature is able to thaw out at any moment, killing a person, absorbing him and then imitating in the most perfect manner. Nobody can be trusted anymore. The people become overly suspicious and paranoid. And up until the very last moments there aren't any special ways of finding out who is human and who isn't. Unfortunately, the main drawbacks of the movie are the superficial characterization and highly unreal behavior of all the frightened men. Even though they realize that they are in grave danger, they sometimes act as if their main purpose of being inside the base was to actually get attacked from behind and murdered. What's more, at times it's even hard to grasp how many people are actually dead and it somehow takes some of the fun away. Carpenter didn't put a huge emphasis on the portrayal of his characters; he much rather wanted to astound us with the very realistic special and visual effects, which are actually quite scary and gruesome. I mean, even though there are some terrifying scenes of gore and pure repulsion, they probably won't be too expressive for regular viewers (or will they?), and exciting enough to stimulate the blood lust of all the hardcore horror fans. Great music score by Ennio Morricone only increases the mood and the overwhelming suspense of the story.However, even though it has some minor flaws, it still is a great and thrilling picture, and it stand out from the huge crowd of many dull and muddling horrors that came out in the 1980's. Dare to watch The Thing, and it will certainly satisfy all your bloodiest desires.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Horror Films Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with Alien, this is hands-down one of the greatest sci-fi horrors ever made. But in many ways, the monstrous horror of the creature is almost secondary to the paranoia of the men and the claustrophobia of the surroundings. As with Alien, everything about this movie is perfect - from the pitch-perfect casting choices, through the script, the production design and the brilliantly appropriate music score, to the fantastically gory effects courtesy of the FX genius that is Rob Bottin. And talking of the special effects, the mechanical effects of this movie are in my opinion infinitely better than anything CGI can produce. The way they move seems so much more alien than the fluid movements you get from CGI.Everything in this move all just simply... WORKS.If you've never seen this classic, I throughly recommend it to see a director at the top of his game, and a movie that doesn't pander to Hollywood committee-based decision-making unlike so many of today's movies. Awesome stuff!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thing is one of my favorite movies, and my number one horror film. It's a classic. Although I'd say the highlight of the film is special effects, this doesn't mean the story was neglected. Scary special effects backed up by an equally scary story make The Thing better than most horror films. I love the twists. It's a genuinely suspenseful and gripping scary movie.The special effects are still amazing to this day. In fact, I find some of the scenes far scarier than anything CG. Really impressive stuff. I have to say nothing looks very cheesy at all, which is impressive for a movie made thirty (wow!) years ago. Amazing movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never given a 10 out of 10 before, but having just seen Prometheus (which I feel falls into horror rather than sci-fi category) I felt I needed to return to The Thing to watch a classic film that in my view set the benchmark for horror films.The Thing manages to hold the suspense throughout the entire length of the movie, from the eerie bass line at the opening credits to the very end when you don't know whether that dude is himself or not....and then it begs the question as to 'well if he isn't what he seems then why not just jump out and finish him etc'....so you come away never knowing and always asking yourself what happened to Kurt.It is this suspense and mystery that so many other films fail to deliver and in which The Thing does so very very well in succeeding. The acting is also fantastic, along with a setting and surroundings that contribute massively to making the plot seem more real. This is a real treat for the senses! Just back to Kurt, I hold my hands up as by far the best movie he has ever done- portrays an absolute hero as hero's should be- drinking whiskey and having a no-nonsense approach to dealing out blows to the aliens.The other excellent thing about this movie is the special effects- some of the effects in this 80s film STILL blow modern day computer generated graphics out of the water. True, some are less convincing but overall I feel the blood, gore and detail is much truer using these old methods.Don't bother going to watch the modern-day sequel, it will only disappoint, just be glad if you have seen this movie that you were lucky enough to watch an absolute game-changer and make sure you show it to your kids......I must have seen it when I was about 9 and didn't trust our dog again for years!!! 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter's early films are amazing - this is one of them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was difficult for me to decide how many stars to give this wonderful film. It is certainly an 8 or a 9, I thought, and I've ended up giving it a 9 because every second of this film - from the first to the very last - is riveting and engrossing.Yes, perhaps this reason was what persuaded me to give the 9 rather than the 8 rating - so, so many horror and sci-fi films begin slowly, with action not occurring until 30 or 40 minutes into the film. In other words, the first 1/3 or so of the film is spent in characterization, setting, and building up the conflict. From the first second of "The Thing," however, the suspense and the mystery are immediately evident, with the excellent score to the film (the Carpenter-esque, bass-pounding "bum-bum......bum-bum") reinforcing the drama unfolding.This is a very, very smart film. It amazes me how fine Carpenter's early films were - Halloween, The Fog, The Thing, Escape from New York, and, perhaps the best of all of them, Christine. Wow, what a list!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter is legendary for making scary horror films, but this one creeped me out the most! It's got everything a horror/sci-fi movie should have. ET stole the thunder from this film, but now it is a classic. There are some really crazy monster effects in this movie, most of them rather bizarre, but if you have seen John Carpenter movies before than you know what kind of bizarre to expect.Kurt Russell is very cool in this movie as he and the other men at the Antarctic facility try and fight off this nearly invincible foe. The monster and Kurt Russell are the whole reason to watch this movie, so if you plan on watching a conspiracy sci-fi movies, don't bother with The Thing, because this is just monsters, flame throwers, and snow, very simple stuff.This is probably my favorite sci-fi movie next to Alien and Aliens, and I think any fan of Kurt Russell, John Carpenter, or big, slimy, human killing, body transforming, mutant space creatures will love this movie. To me, Escape From New York and The Thing are John Carpenter's two best movies, so check out one or the other if your a fan of cult sci-fi classics. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not seen the original. But without having that as a comparison I can say that The Thing is easily one of my favorite horror movies. The plot follows researchers in the Antarctic who have to battle a shape shifting alien, pitting them against one another. Carpenter captures the feelings of isolation, claustrophobia, and paranoia that are so essential to making this story work. I will never, ever forget the score to this movie, while it is very simple I don't think a better one could have been made for the film. Aside from his ridiculous hat choice early in the movie, I would also say this is a pretty good performance on the part of Kurt Russel, not his best, but he plays his part perfectly. The special effects in this movie are worth mentioning as well. While some people would say it is outdated I think the grotesque creatures Carpenter helped bring to the screen work much better than those in the 2011 prequel which are all CGI. But I'm not sure that should be mentioned in the same breath as Carpenter's The Thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best, if not the best Sci-Fi Horror film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this in the theater at its initial release in early 1982. This is definitely a testament of how horror films should be made. Although their is copious amounts of gore, it never lags in suspense, good acting, taut plot buildup, and enthralling drama. This is a time when CGI was nearly unheard of and special effects and horror make-up were made from scratch in an artists studio. Yes, they literally had to build and create tangible/three dimensional puppets, robots and props to enhance the movie monsters and horror effects. By the early 80's there were several notable horror make-up artists that earned the majority of the business. Therefore, they were at the height of their craft due to competition and a deep appreciation and desire to explore the depths of their creativity that the imagination could fathom.The drama is also excellent as the story envelops e are immersed in the crew's journey and struggle to examine what is happening to their camp due to this alien intelligence that has invaded upon them. Kurt Russell is simply great as the unshakable MacReady. The rest of the cast offers some good performances as well.What makes this movie so frightening is that eventually the crew members all become feverishly suspicious of each other as this inevitable terror befalls them. They must decide to either collaborate or fight each other in order to survive. Being stranded in the desolate arctic snow is claustrophobic enough; but add the ominous and elusive alien presence with the growing resentment and distrust for each character and we are left with a confounding morass destined for doom. A sequel to John Carpenter's version was made in 2011 and is supposed to be the backstory to his version. These two movies should never be confused for the 2011 version is far inferior and lacks the good acting and character development. It also relies to much on the usage of CGI to be taken seriously.</fullReview>

A team of Antarctica scientists encounter a shape-shifting alien lifeform. This is set in the winter of 1982 with a team of male scientists and a helicopter pilot, R.J. MacReady (Russell) who find a dog and Norwegians that have been infected by a mysterious alien lifeform. They discover that the alien presence has the ability to assimilate human cells and shape-shift. As some of the team members become infected, MacReady and the others begin not trusting each other and try to survive. This is one of Carpenter's best that has amazing special effects by Rob Bottin and Russell is great as usual. I highly recommend this.</fullReview>

Everyone is believable and their fear is palpable. Kurt Russell is the great anti-hero and is great as the "clutch" guy who really doesn't give a f***. John Carpenter did NOT do the music, Ennio Morricone did thank goodness and his score set the mood perfectly. John Carpenter should not score movies even though it's apparent he loves to dabble in music. Is he trying to save a buck or is it ego? Rob Bottin's special effects were phenomenal though they were considered gross and too gory when the film was released. The story is different from original version though the original was good also. This is by far John Carpenter's best movie and is much better than Halloween imho.Along with Alien this is as good as sci fi-horror gets.</fullReview>

Let me say right off the bat the cast is gold. Everyone gives very convincing performances, the top favorite of mine being Kurt Russell (obviously), Wilford Brimley and Keith David whom many may recognize as King in Oliver Stone's "Platoon". The story which is indeed a re-make in some regards, is by Bill Lancaster, and is extraordinarily well done. It's a familiar sci-fi/horror plot premise, but never done as well it is here, or since. It keeps you guessing right up until the end, and I don't exaggerate.The effects by Albert Whitlock and Rob Batitin are extremely bad ass, all before the times it got so easy with CGI. It's grotesque and beautiful all at once, being one of the high-points in effects history. The stop motion animation is one of the best of its kind, and continues to terrify. And to top it all off the legendary composer Ennio Morricone does the score. You might recognize the name from the Spaghetti Western glory days, seeing as he composed for all three films of the Man with No Name trilogy. The score is chilling and definitely one to remember.It's a spectacle in film history by many means, and I shall revere it eternally.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter's The Thing is a very scary science fiction/horror movie with lots of suspense throughout. This is classic John Carpenter. He knows how to send chills and shivers down your spine. This movie focuses on a group of scientists stationed in an outpost on Antarctica who encounter an alien life form that consumes and replicates other lifeforms. When the group discovers this, they begin to think that one of them might be infected and they do not know which one. That is what makes this movie very shocking, you do not know who is or is not infected by the alien, and neither do the characters. In other words, their is a lot of suspense and their is a sense of paranoia. And it was such a very big shame it got nominated for a golden raspberry award for worst musical score. I really liked it and I personally think it is very good and very well done. The music is very dark and ominous. And fits very well with the atmosphere of this movie.

		<fullReview>John Carpenter's The Thing takes the original story "Who goes there?" and updates it to the 1980's. However, because of the isolation in the Antarctic, the time could almost be anytime. John Carpenter uses every ounce of his prowess to turn in a creepy, exciting and horrific thriller in which the monster could be anyone or anything. This movie received a lot of bad press because it came out right after E.T. Everyone was looking for a friendly alien at this point and the malevolent shape shifter from this movie was not well received. Well, the hell with those people. In the years that followed, viewers saw this movie pop up on cable and were astounded at the pure genius behind it. This movie was made at a time when there was little or nothing in the way of CGI effect. Each and everyone of the creature effects was constructed out of real stuff by effects expert Rob Bottin. The cast is perfect at every turn and Kurt Russel is bad-ass just like he was in Escape from New York. If you want to see a great sci-fi/ horror movie, check this one out, I have never seen anyone disappointed by it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Isolation. Paranoia. Fear.These are the typical key words used to describe John Carpenter's sci-fi fright-fest 'The Thing'.The standard plot synopsis normally reads; Antartic research team terrorised by shape-shifting alien.What's not so easy to convey is the sense of unease that permeates throughout the movie, from the opening scenes of arctic desolation and that menacing bass-thrum, to the unsettling and downbeat ending.This is genuine, stomach-curdling sci-fi-horror, which effectively translates an ever-escalating sense of fear for the characters amidst the claustrophobic settings of the research base.Little needs to be said of the well-documented special effects, which may still be considered a bar for non-CGI creation, and where acting and pacing are concerned, not a foot is wrongly placed.It's not without some consideration that I award this film a top score, for even today, having watched it recently, I'm still gripped by the taut atmosphere that veins the whole movie.I can think of no other film that inspires such a sense of foreboding or menace, and very few that deliver on such sudden bursts of visceral bloodshed and outright horror.A true classic for anyone with an interest in being scared.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter's intense, grim, shocking, and garish monster movie has transcended its poor box office performance back in 1982 to take its place as one of the great experiences of its kind, and one of the director's finest achievements. A more faithful adaptation of the John W. Campbell, Jr. short story "Who Goes There?" than the 1951 Howard Hawks production "The Thing from Another World", it gets a lot of impact from the central conceit of the story, dropped by the makers of the Hawks movie.Here, the rampaging alien has the ability to assume the appearance of any living thing that it consumes, leading to an overwhelming sense of paranoia as the men of the story have to come to terms with the reality that they can't trust each other any more.The Antarctic setting is perfect for such a story, with our characters completely cut off from contact with civilization, isolated and forced to work to save themselves. While the story is an extremely serious one, with a tone of dread established immediately, there are memorable doses of humour at select points that provide much needed and highly amusing relief. Ennio Morricone's subtle, scary music, unfairly nominated for a Razzie at the time, is appropriate to the story. Carpenter collaborates with a first rate creative team (especially production designer John Lloyd and cinematographer Dean Cundey) who lend their considerable talents to make an incredible looking movie. Carpenter uses his standard Panavision aspect ratio of 2.35:1 to arrange people and objects within the frame to great effect. Makeup effects expert Rob Bottin creates one of the most striking monsters to be seen in the science fiction genre, displaying a delightful macabre imagination all the way through; the scenes are now indelibly etched in the minds of those that have seen them. (Stan Winston's contribution, done as a favour in order to help Bottin with the workload, shouldn't be overlooked, either.)Carpenter's frequent leading man Kurt Russell delivers a superbly understated performance as the reluctant hero MacReady, and receives rock solid supporting performances by a well chosen cast of familiar character actors - Wilford Brimley, T.K. Carter, David Clennon, Keith David, Richard Dysart, Charles Hallahan, Peter Maloney, Richard Masur, Donald Moffat, Joel Polis, and Thomas Waites.Carpenter's somewhat slow pace - at least in the early going - allows the creepiness and sense of mystery to really take hold until the nature of the threat is finally exposed. The story devastatingly illustrates just how ugly things can get when a chain of command is broken and a group of men start to mistrust and fear each other. (It's a brave move on the part of Carpenter and screenwriter Bill Lancaster to exclude female characters, something that wouldn't fly nowadays.) The men even act like sniping children at times. It's bad enough when people have to battle an unexpected alien menace, but when they can't even work together, it's even worse.No matter how badly this may have fared both critically and commercially back in 1982, its following has done nothing but grown stronger in the over 30 years since its release. It represents a great effort from everybody involved.Nine out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, it's certainly SOME thing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You'll never, ever, see anything like The Thing again." -John Carpenter, 1997.He's absolutely right. No one would have the nerve to make a film as disgusting as this in the current "let's not offend anybody at all, ever" climate. Without a single frame of CGI, the Thing shoves our faces right into Rob Bottin's gruesome make-up effects and proves that genuine, tangible prosthetics and monsters are a million times scarier than a cheap, obvious effect done on a computer in post-production.I don't understand why people keep referring to this as a remake. It's far, far removed from Howard Hawks' version. Even Carpenter himself, a Hawks admirer, says that The Thing is it's own movie, and much closer to the original novella 'Who Goes There' by John W. Campbell Jnr.Set in the lonely Antarctic, The Thing takes the form of a wolf and bounds across the snowscapes to a US research station, pursued by frantic, half-mad Norwegians. Unable to communicate with the English-speaking American team they end up dead before being to warn them that the cuddly dog is actually a hideous shape-shifting monster. The team eventually discover the wreck of an alien spaceship that has been entombed in the ice for at least 100, 000 years before the monster begins to wreak havoc at the research station, intent on consuming all of the humans and making it to civilization where it can take over the entire planet.Fear and paranoia grow among the team as they desperately try to prove who is biologically human and who has been assimilated by The Thing. It's utterly horrific stuff, but it's not without its illogical moments and massive plot holes. The universal adoration of The Thing seems to forget that it doesn't make complete sense. Carpenter admits he lost track of who is and who isn't, which seems kinda lazy. Ambiguity can be a cheap way of maintaining uncertainty and Carpenter should have delivered a more focused and precise plot. Plus the paranoia was way overdone. By the halfway mark I reckon the fear among the men should have been merely implicit rather than verbally delivered at every opportunity.It's rather strange, and fitting, that this movie also comes across as a big-screen adaptation of HP Lovecraft's 'At the Mountains of Madness', which also features research scientists in Antarctica discovering an ancient shape-shifting lifeform and losing their sanity.Despite the problems, this is Carpenter's direction at its best, with long, slow, tracking cameras in gorgeous anamorphic Panavision, evocative lighting, and lonely minimalism. Even Ennio Morricone's score is very much restrained. The cast have their defining features mostly hidden beneath thick facial hair, but Kurt Russell once again proves why he is Carpenter's favorite lead, and the awesome Keith David provides plenty of badassness just with his mere presence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nerve-wreaking sci-fi horror classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the new prequel coming out appropriately October, 2011, I thought I'd look back at one of my favorite science fiction alien movies: The Thing. More closely resembling the novel it was based on "Who Goes There?" than the 1950s flick which only follows the first part of the story with the scientists finding the spacecraft, John Carpenter's remake made an icon out of the terrifying shape-shifting visitor.It's a typical monster run amok, but this time none of the characters know who's real and who's a thing because the organism is able to assimilate its victims and take on their likeness. When it attacks, it rips itself apart into a bloody blob of grotesque body parts. It really draws tension between the characters, which makes it especially interesting and the concept of not knowing who's who is pretty scary. Heck, the things are pretty scary, taking on ugly forms and making that wailing scream can send chills down one's spine. Thankfully, our heroes are armed with one of my favorite weapons of all time: the flamethrower, the only effective tool against the organisms. I'm happy that the Thing is more like the book because the 1950s interpretation of the creature is not very faithful being a blood-sucking Frankenstein-like humanoid made of vegetables.With actors like Kurt Russel and Keith David and a good balance of horror, sci-fi, and mild comedy, this is an excellent movie and I look forward to seeing the 2011 prequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>29 years later, still a great film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I dived into this film with absolutely no expectations whatsoever, having only heard of it in mere passing, not hearing good or bad things. I was pleasantly surprised. What I expected to be a cheesy, cringe- worthy 80's B-movie instead turned out to be a clever, intriguing, and occasionally quite tense film. The score was generally quite good, if weak in some places, but it did it's job well. The camera work and directing were very good, as was the script; it never felt over done. The production values on this film were outstanding, with it's 11 months in pre-production. It really shows, making this film a pleasure to watch throughout. The acting was good as well, if perhaps a bit stiff in places, but for the most part it portrayed a believable scenario. And on the subject of believability, the special effects here deserve a mention. They are absolutely fantastic; gory (which I guess doesn't appeal to everyone, but I rather enjoyed it - it's worth to note however that there is a fair bit of gore here) and at times downright disturbing, it seems more amazing to think that this film was made nearly 30 years ago. It's a lot to it's credit then, that even with the advancements in technology and CGI, the effects here are still noteworthy.Overall, this film paints a superb, tense, gruesome and eerie picture, which is still a wonder to behold decades later. Although it may have been a flop when initially released, it's easy to see why it has such a cult following now. A film I thoroughly enjoyed watching, and would be happy to watch again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With all the fancy technology of today that are used to create all the special creature effects there are only a few films in my opinion that really have some cool special effects and the best part is all of them came out in the 80's, before the days of overused CGI.The films that stand out are A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, Clive Barker's HELLRAISER, Clive Barker's NIGHT BREED and John Carpenter's THE THING, now THE THING is the only one out of the bunch where I actually get grossed out when I looked at the creature effects, I mean as I'm writing this review this film is 29 years old and I've watched it again recently and the effects still gross me out, that's how well this film is made, put it back in the cinemas and it'll wipe the floor with every other new horror movie out there.The acting is outstanding, many of today's actors will struggle to match this caliber of performances and the plot is simple, very well paced and does a great job of creating a high sense of paranoia.Overall, its a classic worth revisiting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IMDb Top 250: 174 In the year 1982, while all the other films were having a nice party, The Thing was at home, cutting itself up. You've probably heard how gross this film is, but I'll say it again: The Thing is arguably the most visceral film I've ever seen and deserves all of the praise it gets.Praise? What praise? No one liked this movie in '82. But the special effects/ make-up are so disgustingly real, you will feel sick. The creatures are so vile and spectacular it's unsettling. They are real: unlike today's CG monsters, these actors were in the same room with those monsters. It adds to the effect. The Thing was way ahead of it's time; people could be scared of the 30-year-old movie today if they saw it in theatres. (If you like Dead Space, you'll like this.) None of the acting is particularly special, but it doesn't need to be. In fact, a little fleshing out could've helped, maybe during the first half hour. I confused the characters during the film.The plot is very simple, yet very complex. Sure, you can boil the summary into one sentence, but there's much more than that. Where is it from? How did it crash? One could spend a lot of time thinking about the film. The plot moves quickly, and is always interesting. And gross.It's easy to see why The Thing is so well liked today. Ahead of it's time content and a timeless theme of paranoia and uncertainty. Ample gore and tension. Just look at the FAQ page; people are serious about this movie. And it can add me to its fan base. 8.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll be honest, this is the first John Carpenter film I've really seen. I saw Big Trouble in Little China when I was a little kid so I wasn't paying attention the way i do now that I'm older, so that doesn't really count. This is the first John Carpenter film I have seen with an attentive attitude.Before watching this I never knew who John Carpenter was. But he always intrigued me. I'd walk through the DVDs at Borders and see John Carpenter's The Thing or Escape From NY. I wanted horror one day and bought The Thing with no expectations... Perfect purchase.From the opening to the finish I was hooked. The way the film opens with little to no music, just some synth bass popping in every so often, really makes the film more mysterious right off the bat. Why Ennio Morricone's score would be nominated for a Razzie is beyond me since considering the film and genre it fits perfectly.The fact that the crew doesn't fight the alien by going all guns blazing is very reminiscent of Alien. These aren't soldiers, these are scientists and workers. No professional combat experience here. They have to rely on their wits and their peers to survive. Tensions begin to run higher and higher as the film progresses. It doesn't get any easier as the creature picks off and replaces each crew member one by one, making the one-by-one scenario a bit more terrifying because not only are people dying but the alien is mimicking them so nobody knows who's dead and who's an alien.The special effects are top notch for the time. In fact I thing it's better than some CG effects that appear today. With CG effects the first thing crossing my mind is noticing all the imperfections. Physical effects actually feel real and much more believable, which made the transformation sequences pretty disturbing.The acting is first rate as well. All the characters felt believable as did their relationships with each other during the rising fear and tension. And Kurt Russel is a joy as always.Again on the music. The lack of music actually helps define the lonely mood and sense of claustrophobic solitude in the arctic wasteland. It deserves an Emmy not a Razzie.Final Rating: 10/10 Right on par with Alien.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A delightful and charming story about a visitor from another world who lands on Earth and comes in contact with several humans whilst trying to find a way home....And this, is another film where an alien being, comes down and takes the form of several humans (and dogs) trying to disguise itself and avoid being found to then return home. How similar are ET and The Thing? Both are made in 1982, both are about alien visitors and both films show the obstacles faced in their plight to return home. Well, I suppose one film is more sickening than the other (I mean how much mush, sentimentality and sweetly sick story can one person take?) But enough about E.T, The Thing has become something of an underground classic during the heydays of VCR rentals, where it's outstanding scenes can be paused and rewound to be watched over and over again. Some of the scenes within the film are jaw-dropping and it's all done pre-CGI. It's amazing what could be done in those early days of creature animatronics.The Thing is directed by John Carpenter and is probably one of his best, but unfortunately it was not a hit. A remake of sorts (John Carpenter was hugely influenced by Howard Hawks) however this is an altogether different beast. Set in Antartica, an American expedition group are interrupted one day by gunshots from a far. A couple of Norwegians are firing at a husky from a helicopter. With sporadic gunfire, one of the American scientists takes a shot in the leg. Shots are fired in response and as a result the Norwegians are killed. The dog is taken in and held with the other dogs in the camp. Unbeknown to the American group, the Husky is not what he seems. Eventually the team set out to discover why the pair of Norwegian were shooting at the dog and what they find out is beyond their darkest nightmares.The plot isn't anything original as the group is picked off one by one until there is one man standing (or in this case two), with it's remote location it's very similar to another classic sci-fi horror that is Alien....but where Alien only really has one complete genuine gross out moment, The Thing has so many that it's a wonder when you see the first gruesome transformation how they can top it... but they do. The whizkid at the time (Rob Bottin) deserves so much praise as his effects beat anything that modern special effects can bring to our screens. He was also only 21! The central themes on what makes us human and the loss of identity is dealt with in vivid detail. As men in joining the tribe we gain a sense of belonging but as a result we lose personal identity. Paranoia and trust are tested to the limit. Characters start turning on each other, they begin shooting and eventually resort to tying up one another. In one of the films more lighter moments, they devise a test to see who is human and who is not, from this comes one of the most memorable and perfectly delivered lines. There is relief amongst all the bodily gore.The technical achievements in this film is what makes it so watchable. The score by Ennio Morricone is a haunting yet deliberate heartbeat which is minimalistic yet menacing. One of the only films where Carpenter hasn't had an input on the scoring, but nevertheless Morricone's approach is very suited and matches and enhances the films eerie atmosphere.There is a lack of character development within the film (that is the only flaw I can say), and it seems that Kurt Russell's character (MacReady) is the only one who is given enough personality for us to root for. The majority are unfortunately given the basic stock character traits, though the acting by all is well above average, there isn't enough depth to them.With a tight a script, direction and amazing effects work by Rob Bottin's crew (never has intestinal and flesh mesh been so beautifully realised), it has still stood the test of time and is always a joy to watch. One of my all time favourite films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am 15 years old and i love horror movies. the reason that i believe this is John Carpenter's masterpiece is not only due to Rob Bottin's amazing and grotesque special effects, or of Ennio Moccorone's haunting score, it is because of the care and time put into writing believable and sensible characters. All of the actors (especially Wilford Brimley)execute their lines and actions very well, and they make it seem like the characters handle situations much like a real group of people would. another great aspect of the film is the atmosphere presented in each set and location. all of the suspense is well executed and the scares are not expected upon first viewing. the kills (or transformations rather)are inventive and truly frightening. This movie was ahead of it's time for 1982, and remains an essential classic for any horror fan.i just hope that it won't be remade like the fog, another Carpenter classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Among the many sci-fi horror films to be released in the wake of Alien, John Carpenter's The Thing and John McTiernan's more action-oriented Predator (aswell as James Cameron's Aliens) were the only ones that have really achieved classic status. The Thing was initially a critical and commercial failure (many factors have been blamed, from the gory effects work, its release in the wake of the more happy E.T.), but it did not take long for critics and audiences to finally come round and see what a fantastic movie it really is.Closer to the short story Who Goes There? by John W Campbell Jr, than its previous cinematic incarnation, the 1951 classic The Thing From Another World, this presents a harrowing story of a group of isolated individuals who find themselves locked in a desperate struggle against a terrifying alien lifeform that has the ability to absorb and imitate its victims, and whose very existence threatens the human race. The protagonists, including a terrific Kurt Russell, find themselves battling the creature and its growing number of human impersonators, with the battle taking some interesting turns. Besides the personal battles, with flamethrowers at the ready when a human reveals his true nature, the creature often tries to throw a spanner in the works by playing off on their paranoia, making them mistrust each other, even setting up characters to make others think they're imitations.When the imitations reveal their alien nature, we are presented with some still-awe-inspiring special effects, both highly imaginative and bizarrely grotesque. The creature alters bone structure and ruptures skin during its transformations, providing some truly horrifying and iconic imagery. Ennio Morricone's creepy doom-laden score fits the film well (how it came to be nominated for a Razzie is bewildering). The cast are all excellent, direction is perfect, here's a film where everything fits perfectly. Bonus points for a brilliantly ambiguous ending (thankfully a planned "happy ending" was dropped).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't like Alien (1979) and I got put off by watching another alien, fantasy, sci-fi film again. But when my godfather burned John Carpentar's The Thing, it looked strange but exciting at the same time as it was a Carpentar film.The Thing is about a couple of people who are in snow cabins, studying things and the like. Then a dog runs into the campus and a crazy man with a rifle comes in trying to shoot the dog. He ends up dying and a couple of days later we see the dog evolve into a nasty looking Alien that can take anything it touches and it can imitate that thing. It ends up getting many of the men in the campus and many of the men act out evilly because of the Alien inside them.The Thing has many psychological elements that make this film really fun to watch. It was a little scary, especially when we see that Alien with the really skinny, long neck.This also one of the best remakes that should be owned and watched many times. Even if it's not as good as Halloween, it definitely deserves it's place in the Horror genre. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only reason I am giving a high score is because of special effects which are the best I've ever seen to date. I am SURPRISED no REMAKE was ever made during the 90's utilizing state of the art C.G.I effects available to them. Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, James Cameron, David Cronenberg, John Mctiernan and Ridley Scott should have been the most likely candidates for directing the remake. A remake of the classic 1951 Howard Hawks-Christian Nyby film The Thing from Another World, Carpenter's film is a more faithful adaptation of the novella Who Goes There? by John W. Campbell, Jr. which inspired the 1951 film.The box office performance of the film was poor. This has been attributed to many factors, including Steven Spielberg's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, which was released at the time and features a more optimistic view of alien visitation.However, The Thing has gone on to gain a cult following with the release on home video. It was subsequently 'novelized' in 1982, adapted into a comic book miniseries published by Dark Horse Comics, and was followed by a video game sequel in 2002, with a film prequel currently in the works.Full Plot: In winter 1982, an American Antarctic research station is alerted by gunfire and explosions. Pursued by a Norwegian helicopter, an Alaskan Malamute makes its way into the camp as the science station's crew looks on in confusion. Through reckless use of a thermite charge, the helicopter is destroyed and its pilot killed shortly after landing. The surviving passenger fires at the dog with a rifle, grazing George Bennings (Peter Maloney), one of the researchers. The passenger is shot and killed by Garry (Donald Moffat), the station commander. Not knowing what to make of the incident, the station crew adopts the dog.What the Research Team don't know is that the Norwegians were only out to destroy the Alaskan Malamute. Unable to contact the outside world via hand radio, helicopter pilot R.J. MacReady (Kurt Russell) and Copper (Richard Dysart) risk a flight to the Norwegian camp....... And that's when the film really begins.What were the reasons behind the Norwegian attack? See this superb science fiction horror film to find out more.Conclusion: BUY it for your home theater and sit back and enjoy the special effects.

		<fullReview>John Carpenter took this timeless classic from the 1950's and updated it with his version of " The Thing. " The movie is based on the original John Campbell Jr. story and set not in the North Pole as in the original, but at the South Pole. In this version we have versatile actor Kurt Russell playing R.J.MacReady and Wilford Brimley as Dr. Blair. In this version, our Space visitor is seemly more dangerous as the 51 version in that The creature has the complete ability to Morph into any other creature. In other words, it's capable of 'Shape-Shifting' and becoming any creature it comes in contact with. Much more menacing than before, it soon has the entire cast wondering which of them will be next to be absorbed. Dark and horrifying, the movie is both dramatic and suspenseful and with the shadowy world of the space alien, it's only a matter of time before all the cast become prey. A good story and definitely more frightening than the original. Easily recommended. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now this movie was back when horror masters like John Carpenter where really hitting their stride! This 1982 remake of "The Thing from another world" was a sheer delight to all fans of gore and horror! Kurt Russel is perfectly cast as the boozing anti-social helicopter pilot R.J MacReady. His performance hit the right tone of the last guy you would ever expect to take up the mantel of leadership in a situation like this. Actually, I have to commend the entire cast in this movie. They all are individuals with strengths and weaknesses that come off as genuine. The big temptation in a movie like this is for everybody to ultimately rise to the challenge and work together to fight this alien menace. Here everybody is an individual that cant trust anybody else because the enemy is hidden and could be anybody. The setting of the barren ice Continent of Anarctica was so apt to convey the isolation of these men. This and the tight almost claustrophobic way the camera shoots tends to send shivers right up my spine. The soundtrack was truly scary with its primitive methodical tempo of impending doom. The special effects in this movie, for 1982 or even for today, were jaw dropping! I had nightmares for weeks at some of those transformation scenes. Like, remember when the thing-dog is put into the kennels and transforms into some horrific space creature and starts to absorb the other dogs. Or when the "test" to discover who is the thing is done and the blood literately screams and jumps out of the dish. I could go on and on. Whoever did the effects for this movie should have gotten at least an Oscar nomination. In conclusion, see this movie if you like horror, or even just suspense. You will not be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably my third review here of this Carpenter classic. An American scientific expedition in the Antarctic is laid siege by a shape-shifting alien, and no one is able to stop it. Kurt Russell stars as the expedition's bearded, quirky pilot. Shot in Canada, the movie is stark and shocking at times, and the creature effects -- prosthetics, the forerunner to CGI -- are simply amazing. They look great to this day. The opening is haunting: a sled dog is pursued across frozen terrain by a gun-toting helicopter crew from a Norwegian camp. The dog reaches the American camp, and it soon becomes apparent this is no ordinary dog. It is an alien in disguise, which the Norwegians inadvertently released from its 30,000 year old frozen slumber. Carpenter respectfully pays homage to the 1951 Howard Hawks version, but takes his remake to levels Hawks could only have dreamed of. Great supporting cast, including Wilfred Brimley and Keith David. For those unfamiliar with the source material, it is a short story called "Who Goes There?" Carpenter's version is much closer than Hawks' to this Cold War tale. Hawks' version is essentially the Frankenstein monster loose in the Antarctic. The remake is notable for its all-male cast and sense of claustrophobia and impending doom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1951 film The Thing from Another World is a classic of its era, but doesn't feel very suspenseful in retrospect. John Carpenter's remake from 1982 reportedly follows the original book by John W. Campbell, Jr. more closely and hasn't lost any of its effect over the almost 30 years since it was first released. The plot premise is the same in both films: a team of scientists on a research station in Antarctica comes across an alien spacecraft that has been buried under the ice for thousands of years. After discovering the hideously mutated remains of another research team, they realize that they are dealing with a hostile organism that can infect any living creature it encounters with gruesome consequences. To their horror, they become aware that some of their own team members may also have become infected... but which ones?The number of actors is small, but the twelve men on the station suit their roles naturally. MacReady, the leader of the group, is played by the always charismatic Kurt Russell, but I would also mention Wilford Brimley as Blair, the station's doctor who cannot cope with the stress, and Keith David as Childs, a strong and somewhat menacing team member. Besides the sparseness of human presence, the atmosphere is also intensified by the overwhelming isolation of the station. The claustrophobic rooms and corridors of the interior scenes contrasted with the vast empty plains that expand all around the compound create a very effective setting for the distressing tale that Carpenter handles skilfully throughout.What I like the most about the film, particularly when compared to the 1951 film, is that the effect of isolation, uncertainty and stress on the crew is explored so effectively. The tense contacts between the characters are essential for the mood, and it's enjoyable to follow the team's evolvement from a carefree and somewhat bohemian bunch to nervous wrecks. Besides the atmosphere, the film also puts more emphasis on spectacular gore effects that are a real treat for any slime fan. The tentacles, crawling body parts and the arm-chewing ribcage are not far from black comedy, but never come across as unfitting for the style.The cinematography also looks good, ranging from the blue darkness of the snowy plains lit by red emergency torches to the flaming interiors. Since the gore and suspense are in good balance and even the last shot holds on to the hopeless aura the film radiates, there is no reason why any horror or sci-fi fan should skip The Thing; it is essential viewing in both genres.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most realistic sci-fi / horror movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like Sci-fi / horror movies, then I promise that John Carpenter's version of The Thing will not disappoint you. It has a good, suspenseful story, great acting from interesting characters, and even better special effects. There are some moments in the movie that still make my skin crawl. The best aspect of The Thing is that it seems very realistic. The characters look and act like real people would if they were thrust into this situation. It also withstands the test of time. In my opinion, it is still the scariest and most realistic horror movie I have seen.This is the only movie I would give a rating of 10. Way too many people throw around 10 star ratings on movies that they simply liked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You gotta be Carpenter kidding me...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After being freed from its ancient crash site an extraterrestrial life form infiltrates an Antarctic research station, imitating taking the appearance of the researchers that it kills.An atmospheric understated sci-fi at it best. I'll never understand how Carpenter lost the lustre in some of the other film he made, nevertheless, his Thing is one of his best movies and also once of the best sci-fi movies ever. Despite being based on the same source material (before remakes were popular) the thing has a look and feel of it's own and is very different from its 50's counterpart.The isolated setting, the astounding cinematography and scenery creates intrigue; drawing you in from the very beginning. It's a perfect horror/sci-fi cocktail of Ennio Morricone's haunting foreboding score, Rob Bottin and Stan Winston's benchmark practical effects (which are to-date arguably unsurpassed) Carpenters claustrophobic set ups and Bill Lancaster screenplay. It's rare that every single actor is exceptional and supplied with effective dialogue. All the cast from Kurt Russell to Wilford Brimley as Blair are all captivating, great casting by Anita Dann. The characters have their own issues and as the paranoia sets in relationships are forged and other broken, building to a bold and satisfying conclusion.This is more than just a cult film with a 'monster' hiding in warm places surrounded by snow, it's a finely tuned science fiction horror masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far Better than I Remembered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw The Thing when I was in junior high, and was rather disappointed. I had read about it in books on horror movies, and had expected a total gore fest beyond anything I had ever seen. Although the movie was indeed bloody, it was not the vomit-inducing shocker I had expected and hoped for.Fast forward twelve years. I purchase the movie cheap on Amazon, having heard so many rave reviews of it that I was wondering if I had missed something. What I found was a sci-fi / horror masterpiece.Too many reviewers concentrate on the gore in this movie, while failing to note the clever use of a claustrophobic, hostile setting, and the tense atmosphere. Although the film is set on earth, for all intensive purposes it takes place in an alien environment, a place so cold no human can survive there for long. It is these aspects of the film that make it genuinely unnerving.The film also earns kudos for being a remake that improves on the original. Whereas The Thing from Another World was basically children's matine fare, this is a truly disturbing film with a deserved cult following.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psychological sci-fi thriller that works paranoia in with suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If 1979's "Alien" was the original hypothesis that the best science-fiction thrillers are psychological, then John Carpenter's "The Thing" is the study that proves it true. A remake of John W. Campbell Jr.'s 1951 classic "The Thing from Another World," Carpenter's re- imagining is another brilliant execution of quiet suspense that gets quickly into your head and hooks into your brain.Kurt Russell, Carpenter's star from "Escape from New York," takes the driver's seat again as one of a team of scientists living in Antarctica when a helicopter with two Norwegian scientists arrives at their facility trying to shoot down a husky. The Norwegians are killed and the husky lives, only the husky is actually an alien from another planet that survives by taking the identical appearance of the organisms it kills. Having had the dog in their possession for 48 hours, the men realize that any one of them could be a thing, causing a huge build-up of distrust and tension.The key part that makes "The Thing" stand above most other alien/creature/monster kills off a group of people one-by-one movies is that last bit about distrust. In other films, the creature is identifiable -- a shark, an alien, etc., but in "The Thing," it could be any of the characters -- now that's both terrifying and awesome. Instead of a thriller where we're just curious about the gruesome way in which the creature will kill the next random dude, we get the simultaneous thrill of wondering which person the creature is. It's like rolling a mystery into a sci-fi horror film.The nice part about that dual entertainment is they feed off each other. While we're busy wondering who isn't human, Carpenter can fully utilize shock and awe when the thing actually does attack and boy, does he ever. The amount of prosthetics and mechanical devices used to create the constantly moving spool of guts mixed with slimy Venus fly traps that is the thing and the people its imitating are incredible. More than 25 years later you almost wish more films stopped pushing computer-generated images so hard and stayed devoted to developing better and better prosthetics. But can shear paranoia and suspense along with the fulfilled promise of excellent visual effects drive a science-fiction story? Apparently so. Russell is the only known actor and there's not a whole lot to the characters other than the way they deal with their fear and paranoia. Another less obvious reason "The Thing" works so well is the parameters the story sets up for itself. Carpenter and screenwriter Bill Lancaster establish a very specific set of rules for what the thing is and isn't capable of, even going so far as to show us the science of how cells from the thing devour other living cells. We know that the thing only reveals itself when its alone with its victim and that it is driven primarily by a survival instinct. These rules lend legitimacy to the story and make it much more interesting for the viewer trying to stay a step ahead of the plot.When it comes down to it, "The Thing" is just smart formula film-making, even though the formula arguably came after this film. It has a director with impressive horror and suspense credentials in Carpenter, who directed "Halloween," one of the greatest film composers ever in Ennio Morricone to do the suspenseful, haunting score and a creature with more than meets the eye who wreaks psychological havoc on the characters and consequently, us. ~Steven C Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I think I'm still human - I hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are so many comments here on this brilliant movie, yet I've been compelled to also write one for so long, so here we go at last.You can opt to answer if my comment is useful, well, I guess that depends on whether you've already seen The Thing or not :-)If you have, perhaps you're in a younger generation (IOW, you didn't see it in the cinema, I think ?). If so, this is an opportunity for you to take a ride back to 1982, as a teenager and the account of it on the big screen. What do you reckon ? If you haven't, no worries, this is not another user comment claiming to not spoil the movie when I think (IMO) it does.... at least to some extent - not plot-wise per se. For example, I read user comments claiming it's not about special effects... you kidding' me ? The Thing's special effects (in 1982) didn't just shock, they truly terrorised (more below on that, stay tuned)!So, let's go back to 1982. All the masses were flocking to the theater to phone home (ET). A bunch of teenagers about 15-17 - my friends and myself included -wanted to see 'The Thing'. (I personally had no desire to see ET at that time, I'd read the book and that sufficed - for now). In hindsight, I'm glad we did. Sorry - correction, a couple of mates back then didn't, I think. One "friend-of-a-friend" (amongst the bunch of us) came out of the theater looking pale, he felt sick (well, he looked it :-) because of the terror he just went through. Is that good ? Absolutely ! Now, let me digress briefly to the special effects. I've seen my share of horror movies. Some have great special effects, sure. But this is 2009. Terminator 2 presented a quantum leap in CGI. But James Cameron thought it through, as usual. He knew then that CGI is - or should be - the last resort, not the first. The team that ensured The Thing delivered its full impact beyond the nightmare story, using every resource available at that time (CGI wasn't one of them), succeeded too well it seemed. Rob Bottin's (yes, even Stan Winston) willingness to push the envelope - of course with the help and synergy of many other brilliant minds - did something I have/had never seen in a story on the screen : I spent years, stumped ... speculating how on earth the movie's visual juggernaut was conceived and punched into my face... And I couldn't figure it out. (not until the fine day I got my hands on the special edition DVD).Now, again, consider this is 1982 ! I can't muster another movie title where I've wondered how it looked "fake" in other words, how it was done. All others are fake ; some take little effort to conjure up or accept the story's reality, many need a willing mind and some effort. That's not necessarily bad of course.Now back to the future, today. It's 27 years on and this movie still manages to either make you think you're human (you hope) when it picks you up and immerses you into the story of this "frozen dozen" characters. They're isolated, exhausted and too terrified to even consider sleeping. But one or several are hoping they're human - I think - but are probably not. Why ? Because something has infiltrated them, or should I write, 'some THING'.So, if you're still reading and you didn't see the movie then I urge one of 2 things. Rent the movie or buy the DVD movie (I did the latter). OK, now proceed with your favorite ritual (you can get popcorn, I'm not sure if you'll actually remember you have it while viewing:-) and get ready to watch film making that is so brilliant that the audience wasn't fully ready for it in '82, sadly underscored by lack of "box office success". I'm not even sure about 2009. I have flagged this Chef D'Oeuvre to a few younger friends asking to see a "scary movie" when thirsty for more of today's gore entertainment.... most have afterwards admitted they got too scared and didn't see it through :-)So, are you game ? Ennio Moriconi will give you a taste with his introductory sound score, that this story will finally thrill you as you were promised. If you're anything like me, it'll do so much more. Every line of dialogue is great. The actors' performances are outstanding and utterly convincing. (perhaps save for a single line "What do we do now" by Donald Moffat). But Moffat and all other 11 are discerningly cast near perfection and clearly spilled their blood, sweat and tears, it seems, to bring these outstanding performances.To close, it's quite hard to fault The Thing when put in its context. The lighting is perfect, the sound and dialogue is, the score is. And a handful of dark humour will make you laugh, but I did it afterward - when I was able to - back in 1982 when I got every cent of my pocket money's worth paying my cinema ticket.I'm sure you will treasure The Thing's special DVD edition after you've added it to your collection... I did and still do. Finally, in my opinion John Carpenter brings you his best direction and breathtaking camera work in this movie.(DVD purchased in 2004, watched every 3-4 months or so since, the last viewing earlier tonight).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most perfect alien film ever made...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening shot and accompanying (and memorably haunting) Morricone score, the scene is set: A helicopter chasing a seemingly innocent dog through the Antarctica wastelands.And Kurt Russell's (MacReady's) first appearance is also characteristically anarchic and stubborn: calling a computer chess program a "cheating bitch".This film's plot is spot on. The acting feels real, even with the (now dated) mechanical props. The all-male ensemble cast (with some classic B-role actors acting perhaps their life's roles), the claustrophobic set, the palpable personal tensions between diametrically disparate characters... then add to all that a near-perfect alien entity that melds with whatever it touches. Human or otherwise. One word: Atmosphere! The biggest tribute this film has ever had is that NOBODY has ever had the brains or courage to try a remake or a sequel.You think of some of the top-rated films here on IMDb - or anywhere really, films that stand by and for themselves, such as Casablanca, Shawshank Redemption, 12 Angry Men, The Usual Suspects.. and you will know that they were great and remain so purely on their own merits.Well, The Thing is the same. There may be many Star Wars, many Aliens, many Predators... but there is only ONE The Thing.Why? Because apart from its seamless plot, it has possibly the best ending of any Sci-Fi flick ever made. An ending that's simultaneously so open yet so unequivocally definitive.Enjoy. This is Carpenter's masterpiece. An utter masterpiece within the horror alien genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thing! I just watched this horror movie. It was very good. I liked it even more than Alien. The Thing has more involvement with the characters. It also has a darker atmosphere. There is more paranoia. The Thing also had a perfect ending. This movie is most definitely worth watching. But Beware, it is quite frightening. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone under 16. I also would only recommend it too people who liked the horror genre. This movie may not be the best movie to turn someone on to horror, as its pretty graphic. The Thing is a great movie for horror fans. (It's a horror classic). The movie's special effects were very good, but a lot of the gory scenes looked rather dated so they weren't really disturbing. The Thing is about a group of scientists at a laboratory base in Antarctica. One day a helicopter crashes near their base. Norwegians were operating it. Soon after they find out they were chasing a dog. They take the dog into a kennel, and keep it there. Soon after they find out the dog has been taken over by some "thing". They kill the dog, which is no longer a dog but has mutated into a giant alien. They research and find out its an alien creature. This creature can disguise itself as anything it wants too. They then realize that there friends with them could be infected with this creature, further increasing their paranoia. They must find out who is infected and destroy them, and then escape from the base.I was very impressed with this movie. It is gripping, memorable and quite a thrill to watch. I would put it in my top 5 favorite horror movies, and I would definitely watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>glorious gorious masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For many people, John Carpenters swansong will always be Halloween, a taut brilliantly directed movie that continues to generate new fans over 30 years since its release. But for those who know carpenters work, he directed at least 3 other gems, one of those being the 1982 movie, the thing. ostensibly a remake of the 1951 movie the 'thing from another world', the movie begins with a helicopter chasing a dog, whom the occupants are trying to shoot, for which we have no idea why at this point. Carpenter is an expert when it comes to tension and suspense in his movies, right up there with Hitchcock in my opinion. the use of such tension in this movie is where carpenter excels,the master directors vision of a dark cold world perfectly instills the sense of dread and(later) paranoia all of the scientists at this research station feel. So they let this dog into the facility...and then the real terror begins. all the tension and great directing you like wouldn't work though if it were not for the absolutely astounding effects that to be honest are probably the best I've ever seen in cinema, horrifyingly gut wrenching spine ripping head tearingly real and convincing of an alien force that will absorb its host... all credit must go to rob bottin for these effects which with carpenter knowing exactly what to do (and when to do it) added together and we have an absolute corker of a movie which should be in the top 30 movies if all time and top 10 horrors. and yet it has never received the credit it deserves. why? no pun intended but perhaps the violence alienated some people? it is fantastically gory and anyone easily offended and under 16 should avoid at all costs, for the rest well, turn the lights off, get rid of any yakkers and ENJOY. 10/10 David Ford</fullReview>

Usually I see very average performances by actors in movies like these but I have to say that the characters are portrayed exceptionally well in this.Personally, I hate CGI implemented into modern films; it just doesn't work. The Thing shows how gore and special effects should be done and puts current movies to shame.The setting is isolated and perfect for the flick and the music, as usual by Carpenter, fantastic. This is a good movie to watch for the carnage or for the paranoia and break down of characters, or both.One of my favourites and does not get old to watch again: 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest and most layered horror films of all times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe it was the timing. With AIDS rearing its head in eighties culture, the Cold War essentially having everyone fearing the end of the world but John Carpenter's The Thing just has that special something about it.Considering today's horror films are almost entirely remakes (something The Thing has had written about it for several years now) this feels original despite already being a remake in itself. There hasn't really been anything else like it before or since, unlike films such as The Exorcist or The Omen that have found their premise inferiorly mimicked countless times now.The premise is simple. Nine men are stranded in Antarctica - and something is taking over their bodies. Carpenter racks up the tension early on creating the sense within the first half hour that the entire cast could already be infected and never gives you any suggestion they are infected until the reveal. It's that sense of unknowing as an audience member that gives The Thing one of its finest strengths.Performance wise the cast are universally strong, never dissolving into horror clichs to ensure that this isn't just Kurt Russell's show nor is it just another hackneyed remake. Ennio Morricone's minimalist score only helps to heighten the tension around every scene.The real hero of the film, and its strongest suit, is make-up guru Rob Bottin creating creatures that are undeniably taken from the audience subconscious. Every time the creature is revealed in its grotesque form there's a sense that the stuff of nightmares is really well and truly out to get these people and the audience. While many horror films (including many of Carpenter's own works) deal in the unseen The Thing itself is always seen and its terrifying.The fact that the ending ends on such a note of uncertainty is all the more chilling leaving the audience wanting a conclusion that they will never get. It's that sense of unease that never leaves you. The Thing is about a lot more than just scaring its audience. It leaves you thinking. It leaves you wanting more. It leaves you in a state of unease. But then again, The Thing never really leaves you.To put it simply, utter genius</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An under looked horror classic that puts contemporary horror movies to shame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denounced as a forgettable Alien ripoff by most critics upon release, (A frankly unfair claim considering the only thing the two films share in common are isolated settings and a murderous alien that infects people) , The Thing, is a remarkably well made sci-fi horror film, that is nether too thoughtless and gratuitous or too pretentious and inaccessible the twin pits of cinematic failure that all too many horror movies fall victim to. The effects while aged by today's standards hold up well and in some cases remind us all that sometimes good oldfashioned conventional effects, plus good editing and directing can surpass all the computer generated effects in the world, but the real meat and potatoes here is the story telling and the suspense. John Carpenter superbly crafts a story that keeps the audience as off balance as the characters are, by not laying all cards on the table at once and dropping the trump cards in an unassuming timely manner.The setup is well calculated and executed, the all male cast(another point of contention upon many critics at the time of its release used to condemn the film despite the fact that: 1. given the setting it makes perfect sense and 2. It serves a storytelling purpose as it helps to set the mood of the piece), their stark characterizations (we are really only introduced to the characters within the confines of their daily grind and the increasing dire circumstances they find themselves in),and the Antarctic setting all serve to establish a very bleak tone from the get go and as the insidious, amorphous Thing, rears its fearsome shifting forms(quite unexpectedly at times)its gets all the bleaker. But its the Thing's very nature really drives this home. As the Thing can infect and perfectly imitate any organism it comes into contact with, effectively destroying and undermining the ability of the research stations remaining humans to fight and survive as they can neither afford to remain too close to their fellow man nor allow let them out of sight lest they really be a thing. Trust is a commodity they can't afford to have but they cannot hope to survive without it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter, The real horror master!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter doesn't just push the cinematic envelop, he rips it open and reads the letter! The Thing has to be one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. Graphics were simply amazing considering the technology they had in 1982. The film's special effects were simultaneously lauded and lambasted for being technically brilliant but visually repulsive. Even Film critic Roger Ebert called the special effects "among the most elaborate, nauseating, and horrifying sights yet achieved by Hollywood's new generation of visual magicians", and called the film itself "a great barf-bag movie" Sadly The Thing fared poorly at the box office. It was released on June 25, 1982 in 840 theaters and was issued a "R" rating by the MPAA. The film grossed $3.1 million on its opening weekend. It went on to make $13.7 million in North America. Carpenter and several writers who have covered him, such as Michelle Le Blanc and Colin Odell, have speculated that this was due to the release of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial two weeks later, with its more optimistic scenario of alien visitation.Technically brilliant as said before, this movie contains some of the grossest scenes in cinematic history! Such as the dog ripping is own face open and then off to reveal a hybrid 'Thing' Dog. Attacking and swallowing the other dogs. and Wilford Brimley disgusting transformation into the 'Blairmonster' (called so by the Crew). In which the man's head is detached (by itself) and dropped to the floor, where it then grows spider legs and tries to crawl away but not fast enough before McReady (Kurt Russell) blasts it with a flamethrower.This movie was nauseating and yet, overall unbelievably entertaining! I would gladly recommend this movie to any horror buff's who have not yet seen this cinematic Masterpiece! 8 out of 10 stars!</fullReview>

It turned out to be the scariest movie I had ever seen. It stars Kurt Russell as a member of a expedition team in Antartica. They then come across an alien that takes the shape of people. It is probably the scariest when the alien is taking shape into the other people. It is also very suspenseful when they have to figure out who is an alien by testing their blood.

Normally, I detest remakes..you have seen one remake, you have seen 'em all. I like Carpenter and it wouldn't hurt to at least give him a chance. I was secretly thinking "I'll bet he can't rise to the level of inducing the real symptoms of a myocardial infarction." I had friends over to help me critique that night. I don't think anyone said a word or even got up to go the bathroom for the duration. Just this side of the emergency room, I had to take 2 NTGs during the movie and an extra Verapamil afterward. Who knew that such a flick could sicken and mesmerize at the same time?Who knew it would age so well? Twenty-four years later, I'm still awed by The Thing and Carpenter's ability to exude 100% confidence and skill in obtaining just the right results. I'm glad he didn't use the alternate ending with MacCready's survival. Then there were Rob Bottin's amazing special effects. No CGIs. He deserved more than The Saturn. I thrilled at the wonderfully creepy claustrophobic effect.Who knew...that the delicious feature in this movie were the characters' paranoia...Who knew who was who? Who knew if he had the infection?I haven't seen a better sci-fi horror to date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the best remake ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thing is a truly terrifying movie that holds up extremely well over the years due to the incredibly innovative work of FX man Rob Bottin. Bottin proves in this film that great prosthetics, puppetry, and automation are superior to CGI in terms of producing profound horror for the viewers. There are so many moments in this film that will leave your jaws on the floor even after the 4th, 5th, and 6th viewing. Complementing Bottin's stellar effects work is a strong cast, masterful editing, and superb, suspenseful directing by John Carpenter. While the movie is definitely a horror film, it delightfully morphs, at times, into a great "whodunnit" murder mystery with many shocking twists. The erosion of trust between the main characters and the chaos this creates is pulled off wonderfully by Carpenter. Throw in a super creepy score, a great opening and closing sequence and you've got a horror classic. Look for some solid character acting from the great Keith David and Wilford Brimley, as well as a gritty, dark turn from Kurt Russell as the lead. The Thing is a bona-fide top ten all time horror film from a master (Carpenter) at the top of his game. Do not miss!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy, Gross, and Worth It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't remember when I first saw this. In 1982 I was living in Hawaii and all I remember was seeing ET and Poltergiest. Musta been later on HBO or something.At first I was rather upset since I loved the 1951 version which was used as an example in my "Sociology of the Horror Film" class at San Francisco State Univ. There it was touted as a prime example of cold-war paranoia. Plus it scared the crap outta me seeing it as a kid in the 1960's.Carpenter's version hits you in a different area. The stomach, primal fear and that isolation you get when you realize that no one from the outside is going to come to your rescue.As to the "gross-outs"...the transformation of the sled dog didn't bother me. As an animal lover, it would, but by that time it wasn't a dog anymore, was it? For me, the real gross-out was from when Norris had a heart attack to the ER where Doc Copper gets his arms bit off to Norris' head melting off and sprouting legs and eyes. Palmer's stoned comment really summed it up.Great movie and a product of it's times in many ways. If a remake is gonna be like other recent remakes.....I'll pass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you love mystery, scares and old school special effects that make CGI look like pure, unadulterated garbage, then you'll love this phenomenal story from Bill Lancaster. This is by far, John Carpenter's best film, full of grit, fear, conflict and circumstance. With a strong cast of characters and sometimes virulent dialogue, Dean Cundey's subdued cinematography allows us to fill the chill of the Antarctic station and establishes a visual tone that is just plain disturbing in its isolation. Haunting music that permeates the psyche, and Rob Bottin's outrageously mesmerizing special effects, will transport you to another world of shock and awe.Better still, the story is rock solid, loaded with little enigmas that keep the audience guessing even after the credits roll.Do not miss one of the strongest and most profound horrors of all time. Just put on a parka, turn out the lights and dive in for a very terrifying ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A certain classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film first caught my attention on the blockbuster shelf for a very strange reason: it had the only blue DVD case in a field of red tones. Just for the sake of it, I checked it out, and then watched it.Before my eyes unfolded a magnificent story of fear, paranoia, and survival. John Carpenter has managed to make a perfect film: the suspense is beautifully created, ramped up sharply and yet not ridiculously, the blood doesn't run ahead of the plot, but doesn't fall behind either, and the effects are great! This is the type of film that proves that CGI is nothing compared to good old models and sets.The acting deserves special mention. Kurt Russel was terrific in this film as a grim, rather solitary man with the quite apt name MacReady (kudos to Carpenter if he put that in on purpose). Hallahan, Brimley, and Carter are perfect as rather worn and rugged researchers and essential people on a small, isolated Antarctic station.As for the Thing... well, it's beyond description. Robert Frost and Shakespeare himself would fall short of a satisfactory description of the Thing. You have to see it to believe it.A definite 10/10. This film I rank as an equal to 'The Truman Show', meaning I would give it a 12 if I could. I have watched it numerous times, and I am glad that I have 40+ years to watch it again.PS. I don't know why I found it in the Horror movie section... seems like an obvious Sci-Fi to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Claustrophobia and paranoia help this one work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of men is isolated in Antarctica when they are confronted by a shape shifting alien who can imitate any living creature it encounters. It starts with a dog but moves on to the men, who are never sure who is what they appear to be.This is the premise of John Carpenter's re-telling of the 1951 classic "The Thing from Another World". I would say that this rates as highly as some of Carpenter's other works, though it is not my favorite. One of my biggest complaints is that it is just too dark (physically, not in subject matter) and while it may give some effect and contribute to the atmosphere, it simply bothers me. But that's my personal opinion which others might not share. The other place this movie doesn't quite make it is in character development. The characters seem a bit wooden to me and I didn't have much sympathy or empathy for them.What this movie does accomplish well is to create an atmosphere of claustrophobia and paranoia. The effective soundtrack and the use of camera shots that seem to close in on the subjects and keep everything small contribute to this effect, as does the fact that the viewer is kept in the dark as to who the alien might be until it is revealed to the characters.There is some gore in this film and there are some good action scenes. The final scene is an excellent ending to the movie. Overall, it is a good movie that succeeds in what it tries to create.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unrivaled masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1982 remake of THE THING gets my top rating, and few films do. I was awestruck by it from my very first viewing and continue to watch it at least once a year for good measure. An ambitious rehash of Howard Hawks' 1952 THE THING and clearly inspired by Ridley Scott's 1979 ALIEN, JOHN CARPENTER'S THE THING roughly follows the plot of the original: An alien life form that can imitate anything it desires kills and absorbs humans and other animals left and right. If let loose on the world, it will soon be the only living thing on the planet. A bunch of American scientists and their support team working at an Antarctioc base try to contain the beast, with little success. Hawks made his creature a close copy of Universal's Frankenstein monster, while Carpenter opts to have his Thing morph into all sorts of things, including a sled dog, various people and occasionally a snarling pile of absolutely disgusting ooze and flesh. There's even a funny if stomach-turning moment when the creature is an upside-down head running around on tiny feet. I wouldn't have been surprised if one of the men had said, "Now there's something you don't see everyday." It's a fight to the finish, with a very ambiguous ending. The incredible special effects have never been surpassed. The cast is superb, and includes a very hairy Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Donald Moffat, Keith David and Richard Dysart. Plus some wonderfully trained dogs, with an astounding opening sequence involving a suspenseful chase across a snowy landscape. The film was shot in Canada, for the record. While each character is nicely defined, Russell is definitely the tie that binds, the John Wayne-type hero facing down the black-hat villain. Several sequences pay fond tribute to Hawks' original. I like that as well. See it. But definitely not at meal time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still one of the masterpieces of the horror genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When "The Thing" was released, it was a critical and commercial failure for some reason. Maybe it was too gross, because Carpenter's breakthrough success "Halloween" is a very restrained film when it comes to on screen violence (its reputation is derived from the sequels). Maybe its because there are no female characters in the cast, who knows. Looking at it today, time has been very kind. Its still one of the most suspenseful films ever made and an absolute masterpiece of not only the horror genre, but film all together. In fact, I'd say this is one of the few remakes to better the original. The original is an entertaining spook show, but Carpenter's version is an absolutely delirious thrill ride.There are many reasons why the film is so fantastic. For one, Carpenter's direction is the finest of his whole career. He can alternate between being over-the-top and subtle seamlessly, and the pacing is pitch perfect. The acting from the whole cast is very good, as these supposedly tough guy characters take on more depth as the film continues. But, the main reason why this film has garnered its reputation over the years are the special effects. To be honest, the quality of the rest of the film's departments deserve just as much credit. But the effects are still fantastic, and seem way more convincing than most recent CGI overdosing blockbusters. The monster is a truly Lovecraftian creation, and is absolutely terrifying to behold. "The Thing" is one of the greatest horror films of all time. (10/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the ending credits appeared on screen of my TV after watching "The thing" on DVD for the first time(knowing very little about it), I just sat silently and whispered to myself more "wows" than I have my whole life.Some people will call this a horror movie, but I politely disagree. Even tough elements of horror run throughout the movie, "The thing" can only fall under the sci-fi genre. And not only is this sci-fi, it is sci-fi as you will have trouble finding- the purest of its siblings. There is not one unreal symbolic character development like you find in so many other movies; the characters evolve with the movie and there is absolutely no moment where the action stops in preparation of the next THRILLING moment- it is always thrilling, endlessly running the beautiful images and sounds and effortlessly building the story without flaw in your mind.The acting and directing, as well as all the other technical areas, work so well they're not even noticed. Kurt Russel delivers a terrific performance worthy of mention.When watching "The thing" it is hard to try outguessing it, not just because it will surprise you in every corner, but more importantly because you will be sucked into that world and be too impressed by it's wonders to think about anything else.I give it a 9/10 and a top 5 in my all time favorites list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps the scariest movies I've ever seen. John Carpenter really had it back then (we'll just forget about Ghosts of Mars and some of the other crap they've released more recently). Everything about this movie is why I haven't lost faith in American Film. Kurt Russell does an awesome job, and has a commanding presence, even if he's not your typical Ahnold type alien fighting hero. This movie is scary on multiple levels, visually (because Stan Winston rocked), psychologically, and it has that long term fear factor that still to this day (almost a full 10 years since I first saw this movie) scares the bejezus outta me (even if I haven't seen the movie in a long time- just looking back on it gives me the willies). This belongs in movie history as among the top 3 scariest movies ever created, but also, one of the best science fiction films ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the midst of the Antartican snowfield, the scientists and workers of a small American research base are shocked when a helicopter begins to circle their camp, chasing and shooting at a dog. When the helicopter is destroyed and the passenger's are killed by accident, the dog is let into the base and the American's begin to wonder what has actually happened. The helicopter is discovered to be of Norwegian make, and probably linked to the Norwegian base not too far from their own. Helicopter pilot J.R MacReady offers to travel to the Norwegian base and find out what has happened. On arrival, he finds that the place has been totally destroyed. He also discovers a mangled body that looks as though it was once that of a person, which he brings back with him to study. It is only then that the clues begin to add up; the dog morphs horribly into a strange creature that attacks the researchers. They manage to fight it off, but the base's doctor has come to a conclusion: an alien with the power to transform and take the appearance of anybody else is amongst them. Who is infected already, and who can be trusted? J.R MacReady sets out to find the answers to exactly that.At John Carpenter's best, this is one of his greatest alien films. It doesn't have any flaws or mistakes and it is really cool effects. As I can say, but it still have some cheesy effects, but what I say about this movie, it is a classic in every sense of a word.Rated R for Extreme Graphic Violence and Profanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter's The Thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of the black and white version of "The Thing". I was angry that John Carpenter made his own version and I refused to see it... until recently. "The Thing" has a very Lovecraftian feeling to it. Lovecraft is one of my favorite writers so it was inevitable that I would love this film. Let me clear the air about a few things. This is NOT a remake, both films are based on a story entitled "Who Goes There?" by an author I can't remember. I will try to find and read it as soon as possible. The level of paranoia in this film is thick. You have no clue who is The Thing until the transformation happens. The difference between this film and the black and white version is that the black and white monster was like a Frankenstein monster type of thing. This monster is like Alien from "Alien". It takes the form of living things (excluding plants, that's just my guess) and hides in them. Both monsters can be destroyed by the same means, see both films if you want to see what these means are. I'm eating my words, I will bow down to John Carpenter for doing this film. Both films are good, so I suggest if you see this one, see the black and white version. Just don't expect to see the same monster. Another thing that got me about this film is its level of controversy. Apparently, a bunch of sensitive people got offended because there's no females in this film. I don't see people for their race, gender, ethnicity, etc. I see them for who they really are. Some people are way too sensitive about stupid things like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter's Best Film, At Least Critically</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Antarctica, there is a science station where Americans run experiments... but more often than not just get drunk. One day, a dog and a group of Norwegians shows up... and thanks to poor translation skills, the Norwegian is killed. Soon after, a horrible fate in unleashed upon the American station... one by one the crew become suspects in a very heinous string of murders. Who is the killer or killers? I like many -- perhaps most -- of John Carpenter's films. The original "Halloween" and "They Live" are amazing. Pretty much the bulk of his work pleases me (with a few exceptions). And "The Thing" is among his best, which both fans and critics alike seem to agree on. You are working with horror, which Carpenter excels at... and you are working with isolation fighting against an outside enemy (which we have seen in "Assault in Precinct 13", "Pro-Life" and elsewhere). And we have the ideal Carpenter cast: Kurt Russell as R.J. MacReady, Wilford "The Beetis" Brimley as Dr. Blair and Keith David as Childs.The suspense and isolation work to bring the film to a crescendo of horror perfection. And science fiction fans will love it, too (the border between the two is danced upon quite heavily). But what really makes this film the masterpiece it is -- and what will make it never remakeable -- is the special effects. If you have read enough of my reviews, you will know my strong dislike for modern CGI effects and their "cartoon" quality. Here, we have a prime example of what I would rather see in a film: good, old-fashioned effects. More realistic than the cartoons and just visually stunning. I have no idea why they started doing things differently, but every film since "Jurassic Park" has let me down in some way. Rob Bottin is quite possibly the greatest effects master in cinema history.My one concern with this film, and it is very minor, is that the characters are not easy to keep straight sometimes. This goes away with repeated viewings, but aside from the main characters, the secondary characters just seem to blend together. One guy looks sort of like another, and trying to keep the names straight will take a little focus. Some of them do not appear on screen for more than five minutes or have more than a line or two of dialog, it seems. But what good is a killer if you do not have people to kill? Beyond that, what to say? Keith David and Kurt Russell? That does not sell you? Adrienne Barbeau as the computer voice? A dog that kills people with its tentacles? Even the Internet Movie Database seems to think this is one of the best films ever made (well within the top 200) so I am going to go so far as to recommend it to non-horror fans as well. There is just something very tight about this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is without a doubt one of the best horror films ever made. The storyline is amazing, the fact that an alien space craft crashes into the Antarctic where they are frozen in ice for thousands of years gave it that sense realism.The fact that the film begins with the action from the gunning down of the dog by the Norweigians immediately gave the film edge. Only for the members at the science research plant to investigate their camp finding the remains of that alien attack. The overall features of the alien creature's capabilities gradually emerging made the film that more gripping, only films like that of Alien were able to undertake. What was more appealing was the fact the alien can mimic its host turning the film also into a thriller as well, the blood test scene was legendary. The films ending was also great that it left the members in circumstances that you are unable to predict what happens.What deserves great appraisal is the special effects that were able to be performed, 25 years later and they still look realistic. The only thing that let the film down was that most of the characters remained emotionless and the only character that turned out to go crazy just ended up embarrassing himself. This film will always live up to its expectations, a true masterpiece.</fullReview>

Is it the tremendous realism portrayed by all the actors? Is it Rob bottins Superb effects? Is it the excellent soundtrack which reverberates so simply and deeply? I must admit it is all of these and more. The unnerving atmosphere and paranoia held at a perfect pace throughout the whole show combined with the everpresent fear between the characters is simply unmatchable in todays CGI cinema.Do not judge this film by its title(various people i know wont watch it because they believe it is a poor B movie, eg the blob...). Its stood the test of time superbly and is sadly going to be remade for a 2009 release. I can only hope it turns out as good as this 1982 version but it may be hard to match.Fingers crossed all you other Thing lovers!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the greatest and scariest sci-fi movies I've seen, it still creeps me out now when I watch it and that's another reason why I love it. John Carpenter's The Thing is a remake of Howard Hawk's The Thing From Another World made in 1951. The film is scary because they're trapped inside with each other and one of them is The Thing and they can't stay outside because they'll freeze. The paranoia is great between the characters as they start to distrust each other thinking one of them could be it. The music score is another thing why I enjoy this movie because it's so creepy and makes this film more scary, The Thing effects are brilliant and really impressive since all of it is hand made since CGI wasn't made then. The effects are also really gory and disturbing like when Blair does an autopsy on the body of The Thing. John Carpenter's The Thing is a fantastic sci-fi horror movie that is still really scary and should be seen. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember when this one came out I was 11 and I begged my dad to see it. He took me but he warned me that it would be too violent and bloody. I didn't care. We left right after the dog kennel scene. 25 years later I saw and boy, that was one hell of a movie. Seriously speaking, it was pretty scary and gory for younger kids. The outline of this story is an arctic research team stumbles onto a 100+ year old space ship buried in the snow and a frozen alien life-form. The problem is, the alien is loose and it takes the form of its host, so now you don't know who's who. What a twisted storyline. The writers finding clever ways to play tricks with us, and it works.The acting was there, though at times wooden, but still nonetheless there. What I really like about it was the weirdness and the excessive alien gore. It reminisced of such films like "Alien" (1979) and "The Exorcist" (1973). The way that the alien presents itself throughout the film is both disturbing and very clever like, a huge mass of skin and teeth, a human head with spider legs coming out of it, a huge "face mouth" and so many more. The general sound that this creature makes is frightening.The only problems that this movie has are, it drags on too long with some pointless scenes and chitchat. It tried to add character development, but it seemed as though the characters were like that before the alien even came.However, thanks to ET, this movie didn't receive the populatiry that it should have had.But aside from those, this movie is pure frightening, gory and scary fun. I do not recommend little kids to see this movie. If it doesn't affect them right away, it will later on. I do recommend this film to those who like great remakes and general horror genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that even if you aren't a die hard fan of it, you'll still find it hard to turn away from. It is hard macho action and hard macho science fiction, and it does Carpenter a lot of justice I dare say. The old version of the Thing had an appeal to it, but so does this one. And this one I dare say has a lot of grit and excitement to it. The premise is an isolated Arcitc (or is it Antarctic? Who cares)) science team finds a frozen alien and inadvertently bring it back to life. In this version the "Thing" is very high on the evolutionary scale, and very tough to deal with. Each cell can act on its own, but also must respond to the other cells. I know it doesn't make sense, but it makes for one *$#* of an adversary you don't want to tangle with. It eats you and then copies your DNA so that it becomes an exact replica of you with even your memories. How can you beat something like that? Well, Kurt Russell finds a why. He drinks vodka at it! And then he gets flame throwing units to burn it. But which people are real and which are "things"? You see the dilemma. And the script plays it for all its worth, and I dare say it plays it very well. An exciting thrill ride. The characters ring fairly true, and Carpenter, as usual, does his characters much better than most directors. I could nit pick at one flaw. It didn't ring true when a certain character froze and refused to burn up a thing, who even in human form was abusive toward s him. There's my one nit pick. Not bad for over a dozen characters in a full length film. If only other directors and writers could keep it down to one nit pick. There is a question at the end, as to whether one of the survivors might be a "thing." A good ambiguous ending, and enhanced by good selection of music. I think the sound effects unit deserves much praise for this film. The first time I watched it, and I've reinforced that opinion over later watchings, I thought the vodka drank by the characters at the end proved they weren't things, since alcohol kills individual cells, and the "thing" would not be able to tolerate it. Indeed, I believe the alien had to have a stronger weakness than just fire, or it would have taken over much easier. It did have to choose hosts that were alcohol free, because since it couldn't drink liquor, it might be found it too easily. And yes, there are no women in this movie. Which makes you feel like your watching an old war movie. Must say it is very exciting, and very mesmerizing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, you've read all the praise, and it's all true, this is a helluva scary movie, well-made, the effects are outstanding, and it holds up well over time.But that's not all there is to it.We've all seen morph effects, one critter transforming smoothly into another, we were pretty bored with them by the early 1990's. Big deal.But this was made before cheap, cheesy CGI morphs. There's nothing smooth about these transformations. Much the opposite. What's so monstrous about this Thing, is that everything about its transformations is so WRONG. This critter has a rather nasty disregard for the rules, it doesn't care that heads aren't supposed to sprout legs and walk off on their own. Very imaginative special effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thing is the one of the best science fiction i,ve seen in years and i can watch it any time and never get bored its that good. The film is set in Antartica, a thousand miles from the help. A twelve man research team has discovered a Norwegian outpost not far from where they are stayed and make a shocking find, they discover a frozen body in the ice and find out later its an alien life-form buried in the ice for 100,000 years. The film gets into the gore soon as a dog starts to act as though its not a dog but an imitation and turns into a bloody, slimy monster, the special effects are brilliant and the blood and gore will not disappoint you, i swear. As you watch the film you find out that the alien can take over a human cell making it identical to the original feature, when the men start to get taken over some of the scenes of burning are terrific, for those who want a sci-fi film, with plenty of gore, The Thing is the film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A true horror classic. Claustrophobic setting, cast of lesser-known but great actors, slowly building suspense, and terrific gore effects. The tension amps up so well that jump scares aren't needed for the movie to be frightening, and the paranoia that develops feels real and just as terrifying. A great story, because it doesn't reveal everything and it doesn't have to - it leaves a lot up to the audience's interpretation, and remains mysteriously ambiguous most of the time. Because you don't know who gets infected and when, the film is even more suspenseful, as the audience is in the same position as the characters. And the ending, while hopeless and depressing, fits the film perfectly. Plus, the makeup effects in this film are outstanding and just add to the pure shock of the scenes they're in. One of the top sci-fi/horror hybrids ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just your average sci-fi/horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's "The Thing" is undoubtedly one of the best horror movies ever made. Sadly as with most Carpenter movies go it is also one of the most underrated movies being panned by critics shortly after it's release for a reason that is almost pathetic. It seems that at the time people were overwhelmed by the idea of the "good" alien. An idea spawned after the success of "I.T.". And the very thought that a movie dealing with aliens could deviate from that idea was regarded as heresy. Human ignorance is truly a frightening thing, people need to judge films for what they are not for what they want them to be."The Thing" itself is an interesting study on human paranoia as members of a U.S. Antarctic base discover the presence of an alien being (refered throughout the movie only as a "thing") able to imitate any form of life. Not knowing who might or might not be the creature, we see how every character reacts to the situation. There is no mass hysteria or panic just a slow and gradual descent in to chaos as more and more people turn up to be... not quite human.Carpenter succeeds into elevating this movie into something far more than your average Sci-Fi/horror. There are no "whats behind you?" jumping moments here. Instead relying on an intense atmosphere of mistrust and pre-apocalyptic despair along with some nicely balanced moments of visual terror with no small thanks to Rob Bottin's impressive creature effects, he gives us an experience not matched by many other horror films.Instead of just throwing facts and plot elements at our face Carpenter offers us a much a more gradual and delicate approach. By implying a sense of mystery he gives the viewer enough freedom to interpret-ate what has transpired in certain scenes, while giving enough plot to those who are not so fond of interpretation in movies.Ennio Morricone's score works all the way. It's minimalistic and depressing sound perfectly fits the movie's overall tone. Although I've always wondered how would it have sounded if Carpenter (he has been known to compose all of his movies's OSTs except this one) did it? Characters while not as deeply developed are still memorable thanks to the good performances of the actors especially Kurt Russel who plays the "down-out" apathetic helicopter pilot R.J. MacReady. Its worth noting how his character transforms through the movie. From his disregardful "don't give a ...." attitude in the beginning, to that of a unifier and leader of the group of men who try to fight "the thing". But even with that said, there are no false heroics here, there are no "laughing at the face of death" moments and there certainly isn't any sort of comic relief, the movie keeps its atmosphere from the very first scene to the last. Speaking of which, here once again Carpenter keeps his tradition of creating a powerful ending.Quarter of a century after its release "The Thing" doesn't feel dated. And with the disturbingly growing use of computer-generated effects it feels even stronger then before because it shows the life's work and dedication of human beings not computers. Combined with its openness for analyzing it gives the viewer a lot more reasons to watch it for a second or third or fourth or ... time. A masterpiece of terror that will never be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A brilliant horror film. Utterly gruesome and very scary too. The Thing is a remake from John Carpenter, but please, do not let that put you off this film. It is simply brilliant. The start of the film has the alien's spacecraft hurtling towards the Earth centuries before mankind walked the planet with an explosion that unleashes the film's title in amazing shining white and blue stating 'THE THING'. One of the best opening credits for a horror film ever.The cast of actors who play the twelve man science team are a joy to behold and the locations for the setting of their Station in Antartica is visually impressive on DVD widescreen. It must have been great in the cinema. I regret not seeing this on the big screen.Kurt Russell is excellent as Macready, the helicopter pilot who reluctantly becomes the leader of the men trying to combat a lethal shape changing monstrosity that has infiltrated their base. All the actors in this are really good and create terrific scenes of paranoia and tension as to who the thing has infected. My favourite scene in the whole film has to be when Macready tests everyone thats still alive for infection, it is tense, scary and finally spectacular. I love it because its funny as well.Special mention must go to Rob Bottin for his truly amazing make up effects and shape changing designs of the alien itself. If he didn't get an Oscar for best visual effects at the time then he damn well should have. This is also debatable as to whether this is John Carpenter's greatest film...its certainly a gruesome masterpiece.Wait for a cold winter night. Get some Budweiser from the fridge. Sit down and watch The Thing, a horror masterpiece of flame throwing heroes fighting shape changing towers of gore and slime.Utterly brilliant.Ten Out Of Ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this for the first time this morning. Obviously I'd heard of it years ago, it being generally held as a classic and all, but had somehow never had the opportunity to watch it until I was loaned the DVD. Not being a massive fan of John Carpenter's work (Michael Myers and Snake Plissken don't really impress me) I wasn't expecting much, without even considering the 80s music and effects. However, in honesty, I was pleasantly surprised. Whilst too many years have passed for the effects to scare or horrify, they at least manage to stay the right side of laughable, so there was no unintentional comedy. The cast was well chosen and stuck to their jobs, and the film was pleasingly bleak and effective. I am not sure that it is quite the classic that I'd been led to believe (maybe you had to see it in '82?) but it is a good solid movie, and worth a watch for anyone else who has gaps in their film history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the film that turned me into a Carpenter fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, a ten-star film is one that never dies in my memory, and yet can be watched over and over again with the same pleasure as the first time. This could be a technically flawed movie; the pleasure has nothing to do with spit-and-polish (my personal top-ten is idiosyncratic, to say the least!). John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of very few films to fit this criterion.I've been a science fiction fan since I was a child in the Sixties, and I read the John W Campbell short story on which the film is based ("Who Goes There") before I saw the original, black-and-white Howard Hawks film (as with a lot of people, that viewing was illicit, on the TV, when I should have been in bed!). That movie, as with so many that you see as a child in such circumstances, seemed near perfection: the suspense, the inexplicable nature of the alien, the photography; it all just seemed to work. I watched it many times in the years after (and still do, when it is shown on TV). Because of this, I avoided the Carpenter version for years - seeing remakes of one's favourite film is, I thought, always a mistake. When I did eventually watch it sometime in 1988/9, again on TV because there was nothing else on, I realised that I need to change "always a mistake" to "usually a mistake"! Carpenter had produced something different from the original film, closer to the original story, and truly wonderful. From the opening scene of the helicopter and husky, through the viscerally disturbing scene in the dog-pound, to that ending (sorry, no spoilers here!), I was hooked. The sound track alone lives with me - all I have to hear is a close similarity to that bass-over-snare drum beat, and I'm *in* the final scene again ...Until seeing "The Thing", I had Carpenter down as just another gore-monkey, based only on comments and reviews in mainstream press. Since seeing "The Thing", I think I have seen most of his movies - I haven't gone out of my to do so, but if one comes up, just seeing his name as director is enough to make up my mind to watch it. He is thoughtful, and knows how to build a film up so that it reaches a point at which something will stick in the memory.If you haven't seen "The Thing", and you enjoy science fiction, do yourself a favour - sit down in a dark room, wrap up warm, and prepare to have your memory enhanced!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite possibly John Carpentar's greatest achievement as a filmmaker. A remake of the classic "The Thing From Another World", involves an American expedition in Antartica dealing with a tenacious alien that can mimic anything it "absorbs" or contacts; an alien that will stop at nothing to ensure it's survival. This leaves all the characters questioning who is the "Thing".As the film progresses tensions increase between everyone. Paranoia, suspense, and desperation, becomes the prominent feeling and mood among the members of the expedition as each one slowly falls victim to the alien.The soundtrack by Ennio Morricone purveys the dread and despair that the characters feel throughout the film. It does a great deal to add to the suspense. Along with the setting which takes place in Antartica, the viewer is left to wonder if there is any escape from not only the alien, but from the most unforgiving climate in the world. The word "cold" is an appropriate and applicable explanation of this film.The Thing is perhaps the most suspenseful horror movie ever made. A must see, not only for horror fans, but for fans of all cinema. It is one of a kind film that leaves an indelible impression on the viewer, and continually makes them ask what is going to happen next?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that give me a feeling of nostalgia like few others. I remember being a kid and watching this over and over on video and on cable whenever it aired.Some would say that this is Carpenter's best work and it's tough to argue against that point because it's such a great film. It succeeds at creating this mood that's so palpable that I can only think of a few horror films released after this that achieve the same effect. I love the feeling of despair in this film, especially when the team realizes that they're not going to make it off of the outpost alive. You never know who's going to be next in line to become a mess of tentacles, teeth and slime and you never know who's going to bite it. The true horror of the situation that these men find themselves in is captured perfectly through the skillful direction of Carpenter, the acting by the uniformly excellent cast and the music by Ennio Morricone, which helps to seal the deal.The special effects by Rob Bottin still hold up even after the nearly twenty five years since the film's release. This film has one (actually, I should say several because this thing never looks the same every time it appears) of the most wildly imaginative designs for a space creature that I've ever seen.There are many scenes in the film that are classics, my favorite being the initial discovery of the creature manifested as a dog. It's one of the most revolting scenes ever, in my opinion. Another fantastic scene is the blood test scene that somehow manages to make me jump occasionally, even though I know when the big reveal is coming. The ambiguous ending is one of the best ever. We will probably never know just how things ended up* (see below), will we? This is another grade-A effort from Carpenter and I applaud him for this one. Highly recommended! RATING ***** out of *****.NOTE* They made a video game for the Xbox which was considered an official sequel to the film and it actually does answer the question of who survived. But I'm not telling!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never has a lack of trust for one's allies been depicted in such an amazing way. The isolation of the Antarctic adds to the films ever increasing suspense that creeps up on you like a nasty tentacle oozing with alien goo. The effects are timeless and the actors performances are without a doubt perfect. The Flame thrower as a horror weapon is superior (it doesn't break the tension with loud bangs and works well only in close quarters combat). It even has an axe versus door sequence. As well as all that, you have incredibly tense scenes that make this the most awesome Horror film of all time, But in my opinion what makes this film truly great is the way that every member in the team appears in equal proportion to each other with the slight exception of MacReady (Kurt Russell) the main character. This I feel makes it impossible to workout who's next and there fore seals its place as the best horror of all time. I LOVE THIS MOVIE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter still is the master of terror. His scares go far beyond the typical jump out of your seat thrills although he often delivers those as well. As he proves in The Thing, and also with The Fog his level of scare goes into the psychological and makes your skin crawl with every detail of it. The Thing is put together beginning to end to scare and not just with the alien life form itself but the setting and the characters and everything else around it.The Thing takes place in the Antarctic which plays such an enormous role in how this film makes you feel. You couldn't possibly be any more isolated than these men are. Despite all there modern equipment and living arrangements they are thousands of miles from any other human being or contact and all they have is each other. Each one of them have their own skills and reason for being there and overall they have it pretty easy considering their location. That is until another local expedition brings something over to them that will uproot everything. A Norwegian expedition uncovers something in the ice that eventually makes it's way to the American expedition and now is determined to get inside each and every man in order to eliminate them so no one can stop him from continuing on world domination. It's a shape shifter but so much more than that. It literally takes over the person or thing that it inhabits. Given time it can act, speak, think exactly like it's host. What does this mean?? It means that any one of the men in the American expedition could be infected with The Thing. That drives up the level of paranoia wondering who is infected, which one of them is it and when will it be revealed. And when it is Carpenter reveals it in a horrible, gruesome, gut wrenching way. This really is one of the ultimate sci-fi horror films of the eighties. Anyone watching this will have their nerves on end as much as everyone locked away in that habitat.The cast is good!! Kurt Russell is great in the lead role as the tough as nails, quasi-leader R.J. MacReady. He's very rough around the edges, mean almost but bent on survival not only for himself but to protect the world from this thing getting out. Wilford Brimley plays the doctor of the crew who immediately becomes overtly paranoid when he realizes any one of them could be the alien. Unfortunately his behavior marks him to everyone else as the possible alien and they lock him away. T.K. Carter plays Nauls, somewhat of MacReady's adversary especially when it comes to looking at who may or may not be next. Everyone's performance is very intense and adds to the action. Each one of them plays the victim and the paranoia very well. More than anything this film is about isolation and these men being hunted in such a small area with no other option but to try and stop it. It's an intense thrill ride and any fan of sci-fi or horror must see this absolute John Carpenter classic film!! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aaah...The Thing.To see a horror film in which not only is every character over the age of thirty, but distinctly UNattractive, makes a refreshing change, and reminds me of those distant times when actors were chosen because of their talent and their ability to play realistic characters, rather than because of their teen appeal on a magazine cover. And Carpenter chooses a production designer and a cinematographer who can actually create realistic environments rather than over-styled parodies. And there's no gimmicky 'twist' ending, or cameo celebrity appearance, or lame pseudo-romantic subplot.And I REALLY miss on-set physical effects; with all those 20 year old kids trying out crazy new ideas with vats of blood and latex and early animatronics. In the 5 years between 1979 and 1984 we saw Alien, The Elephant Man, Poltergeist, The Howling, An American Werewolf in London, The Thing, The Company of Wolves, A Nightmare on Elm Street...what an era for horror effects! And don't get me started on the death of matte painting. The matte work in this movie is beautiful and seamless.What do we have now? Third rate CGI, former music video directors and professional stylists, that makes even 'gritty' horror movies look like glossy MTV videos.Now I'm going to go Netflix 'The Howling'.</fullReview>

It scared the bejeezus out of me, and to this day after multiple viewings is still chilling (pun intended).I've never been as huge of a fan of John Carpenter as a lot of folks are... I do admire his originality on many films and he is a master at creating an atmosphere of suspense, but this is absolutely his Citizen Kane.You all know the premise, but one area that I really enjoy is the solid character acting. All of the actors (with the exception of Kurt Russell, and he's never done anything better than this) are generally well-regarded and very experienced character actors (many primarily from TV), and they are very believable and just do incredibly professional yeoman-like work. I particularly enjoy Wilford Brimley as the scientist Blair.Also as others as pointed out the HP Lovecraft influences are there, and I feel that perhaps more than any other film captures his style of slow realization of impending doom and otherworldly horror.A rare "10" in my book, and is absolutely a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the beginning of this movie, you don't know whom you can trust. It soon becomes evident that the danger is not just to the few people at this antarctic station, but to the whole world if this monster reaches civilization. Sometimes the reactions of the people don't make much sense, but they're scared out of their wits, and understandably so. This film leaves you with some great images, such as a disembodied head growing legs and running away, and you will never want someone to put his fingers near your mouth again. It's more than just suspenseful; it's realistic. It could really happen. We'll have to hope that aliens like that never come to this planet. Even at the end, you aren't quite sure if the alien is really dead. I'm just glad I don't have a pet dog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter's finest; an underrated masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An alien theme plays as a helicopter flies across the South Pole landscape. Below it is a wolf dog, running through the snow. Apparently, the helicopter is chasing the dog. The pilot emerges with a gun and begins firing at the creature as it runs towards a base of American scientists.Soon, this doesn't sound as strange as it seems. Kurt Russell stars as the American scientist who learns the secret of the creature: it's over 100,000 years old, frozen beneath the ice, and ticked off. We also learn that if it reaches civilization, within 27,000 hours the entire planet would be run by this creature - an alien lifeform that imitates whatever it kills. Dogs, spiders, grandma - this thing can do it. It's up to old Russell to save the day and destroy everything in sight in a blind rage.When first released in 1982, The Thing met with mixed critical acclaim - most of it bad. It was either "not scary" or "relies on special effects", but rarely would you find a positive review. Now, in the new millennium, the film is finally getting the recognition it deserves. The Thing has deservedly joined the ranks of the most famous horror films of all-time. It is even arguably more popular than it's basis, the 1951 sci-fi classic The Thing from Another World.I felt the acting was excellent, especially Russell as the determined chosen leader of the team. The acting actually gives this film a documentary feeling ...Carpenter is probably the movie's second most important aspect. His direction is eerie and suspenseful - this movie helped elevate him to his current position of horror/thriller wonder. If you truly look at this film, you can tell Carpenter wasn't trying to make it scary - he wanted to make it suspenseful, although there are a few jumpy moments in the film.There's also a fitting and chilling score by Ennio Morricone. It definitely doesn't rank among the master composer's greatest scores, but it works well on the mood of the film.The most important, and no doubt the greatest, aspect of the film is Rob Bottin's special effects. They are extraordinary. Every scene involving the alien parasite is completely convincing. Whether it's a gruesome alien bursting from a dog's body, or a severed head sprouting spider-like legs and walking around the room, the effects are outstanding. Bottin proves himself to be a make-up genius.It's no wonder The Thing is a classic. It's documentary-like feel and it's creepy atmosphere are perfect. Carpenter has succeeded in making a thrilling wonder that may even surpass it's aforementioned story source. No horror, sci-fi or thriller fan should go without at least taking a look at this masterpiece chiller.</fullReview>

After watch The Thing, I now own every mainstream John Carpenter movie and love the guy's work. It showcased some spectacular gore, creepy score, excellent performances, and a great story, illustrated with genuine paranoia and fear.First and foremost, the astonishing special effects in this movie are one reason to watch this movie, even if you don't like horror movies. Rob Bottin and his crew created, in my opinion, the most realistic gore effects second only to Day of the Dead. My favorite is either in the dog kennel or the scene with the defibrillator. WOW! I won't say anymore.The score, though not composed by Carpenter, is unsettling and creepy. It fits the movie perfectly and doesn't overpower it at all. To this day when I watch it, I am still creeped out by it.Even though there are 12 guys in this movie, they are so different and well developed that I can name all of them right off the top of my head. Even the minor characters like Bennings, Fuchs, &amp; Nauls are memorable and enjoyable. Kurt Russell gives a fantastic performance here as R.J. MacReady, even rivaling his role of Snake Plissken. This man means business and I would want him to be one my side if push came to shove. Keith David as Childs is wonderfully sarcastic as usual, I mean the man is an expert at playing this role. A. Wilford Brimley plays Blair perfectly. The man can act. The other supporting characters are great too, especially Norris and Clark.The story, based on the short story "Who Goes There?" is adapted perfectly. The fact that it's set in Antarctica already ups the isolation factor. Add in 12 uneasy, unstable and panicky men with a shape-shifting alien that can imitate anything perfectly, and the paranoia level is cranked up to 11.This movie is one of the few movies that actually scares me. The movie itself is creepy, but after you watch it, I guarantee that it will stick with you and creep you out. Go out and either rent or buy it. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was a movie that made me love horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when I was a kid and I watched this movie. This movie used to creep me out. When I was 9, this was what scared me. Now that I am older, I still enjoy this movie every time I watch it. I may even like it even more now in some respects, but nothing compares to when you are young and a movie really scares you. What I love about John Carpenter movies isn't just his style, but the sound he puts to the movies. I'm not sure how much say he has in that, but I do know that music plays a large part in the psychology of his movies. This movie is great on a windy, winter night. With some hot chocolate, a big blanket and a comfortable pillow. It doesn't get any better than that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once upon a time in a cold icy place, there was a little alien called the thing... S**t, This movie is no fairy tale, It's a gore fest!John Carpenter is not known for making movies with fluffy bunnies and wide eyed puppy dogs, No instead he likes to make movies about puppy dogs wide eyes popping out and its guts splatted all over the kitchen sink! The Thing is every horror/sci-fi fans wet dream, Although some what dated now it still has a strong cast who shine as their characters and enough excitement to keep anyone watching right up to the end. I was 15 when i first saw The Thing and i have to admit there was a strong smell coming from my pants long after the movie had finished, What, With the thumping beat of the music, The chunks of meat and drool, I was horrified!Thank goodness however i was not put off watching horror movies from then on. I went on in my humble youth to watch other classic horror movies like Re-animator, From Beyond and other gore movies favorites.Thank the lord for The Thing as it set a new era of horror production right through the 80's here are some of my collection i have now, You may remember some of these... The Thing (of course)..The Howling..From Beyond..Fright Night..Waxwork..Cellar Dweller..Creepshow I and II..The Kindred..The Gate I and II.. Terrorvision and Screamers. I have loads more but these are some of the rare ones i own and enjoyed from the 80's.

		<fullReview>John Carpenter out did himself with this film, and I really don't think that he will ever be able to top this scary little film from 1982. Essentially a remake, stunning special effects, and a great storyline make for a terrifying ride into the unknown.At a remote research lab in Antartica, a team of American explorers come in contact with some sort of thing. Problem is, the thing can take the shape of anything it kills. Now...miles away from civilization, they need to destroy it. The problem is, who is human, and who is now the thing?Truly scary movie. The plot and the extraordinary, and sometimes disgusting special effects, bring this movie way above many others. Definately worth your time. I highly recommend this film. But....if you're squeamish and scare easily...don't watch it alone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror films of the last millennium</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching John Carpenter's The Thing, I was reminded of how good a filmmaker he used to be. In the 1970's John brought us Assault on Precinct 13, Elvis and one of the most profitable and copied films of all time, Halloween. In the 1980's he was involved with no less than 8 films including Escape from New York, The Fog, Big Trouble in Little China and Starman. However, it was his 1982 release of The Thing that is most revered in the new millennium and now it is re-mastered and re-issued on home DVD.Based loosely on the original 1951 film, Thing From Another Planet, John Carpenter set out to remake the film keeping only a few of the original ideas in tact. To ensure success, John assembled an A-list of B-list stars including Wilfred Brimley, Keith David, Richard Mauser and Richard Dysart and circled them around best friend Kurt Russell (Escape from L.A.) in an isolated compound in the Arctic. The film begins with an encounter with a Norwegian group of men who are trying to shoot and destroy a dog from their helicopter. The chopper is soon destroyed and the Norwegian killed, so Kurt (Mac) and the others set out to discover the origin of their visitors. Upon arrival at the Norwegian camp, they discover dead frozen bodies and a block of ice that seems to have transported something to the compound. Outside, they find the burned remains of a creature that has human-like qualities and they inevitably bring this hideous piece of flesh and bone back for examination. It's not long before the dog they took in exposes itself to the group as an alien lifeform that can take on the identity of another being, and soon one by one, the humans become victims and hosts to the alien's intentions. Shot almost 23 years ago, I am amazed at how the special effects still hold up today. The creature effects by Roy Arbogast (Jaws, Return of the Jedi), have not been bettered by new technology and the scene where Norris (Charles Hallahan) has his chest collapse and literally loses his head and we watch it grow spider legs and run out of the room, is as potent and memorable as John Hurt's creature birth in the original Alien.This movie had a lot of things going against it in 1982. It had a cast that consisted of only men (not one woman appears in the film), it had effects deemed too gory for the times and most importantly, it was released the same year as Steven Speilberg's cute alien movie E.T. However, where E.T. ,upon present day viewing, shows signs of dating and blue screen special effects, The Thing continues to show like it was made just yesterday with precision and craftsmanship. The movie has a sense of claustrophobia and urgency and its end, which is far from Hollywood typical, might leave room for a sequel possibility, but not with the same cast of characters. I also appreciated that John Carpenter did not fall prey to the typical horror film ending that we are now so accustomed, where just when you think it is all over, the killing entity gets one last cheap fright out of the audience.The 90's and post 2000 have not been kind to Mr. Carpenter. He has directed such stinkers as Ghosts of Mars and Escape to L.A. and Body Bags, and John's reluctance to work under the Hollywood umbrella of a major studio and budget now show with his cheesy effects and locations. However, he and Kurt Russell can look back proud to the summer of 1982 when they put one of the best horror films in history on celluloid. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers exist.The Thing is a modification of ALIEN. Not a clone, not a rip-off, but a modification. James Cameron obviously took a lot of elements from this movie, both obvious and subtle for Terminator 2, The Abyss, and Aliens. The characterizations are very Cameron-esque and the consistent use of props to advance the plot are extremely similar. Horror, like action, is frequently about repeating the same core three or four elements...which The Thing does in great profundity. Traces are evident from The Andromeda Strain, THEM!, 2001, and The Shining. Unfortunately, the story--necessary in a film of this caliber--is more a prop to showcase Rob Bottin's wicked creations.If there are four levels of horror in the genre, with level one being ingenious, then The Thing probably is the best of level three. There are many positive aspects to it, but so many times the story is hurt by useless cliches such as "Guy runs off alone without telling anyone else what he's doing". These are minor qualms, as are my thoughts concerning the variety and quantity of weapons at the research station. The Thing is, more or less, a condensed version of ALIENS.This is Carpenter's best movie. He alienates the camera from the characters. Watch the blood discovery scene, how many viewpoints and perspectives are taken into account. Some other group scenes like the many "fireplace" moments aren't as adaptive. There are the usual story deficiencies and lack of sophistication (Kurt Russell the anti-hero again, who'd have guessed?), but this time there is no budget hampering like in The Fog and They Live. Another minor qualm is why did Ennio Morricone do the music? Carpenter could've done it himself, it sounds like his usual work. Maybe The Thing is too slick for its own good. Many themes are used, none to their full potential, but all are subsequently more useful than the slasher icon of Halloween. Isolation, Paranoia, Trust, and the usual crackpot biology that requires just a little research to find the holes in it. Is stop-motion's future in horror films? Between Carpenter, Raimi, and Burton I thought there'd be a rebirth in the technique. So far Chicken Run hasn't sparked any renewed interest...Overall, could've used more depth. My last qualm is The Thing uses the two stereotypes for blacks, jive loudmouth and tough boss. The ending, IMHO, is anti-crowd-pleasing and a radical departure from the mainstream. Kudos.

		<fullReview>How often is it that a remake is vastly superior to the original? Not often is the answer. The Thing is the only one that comes to mind. This movie, much more true to the short story ,"Who Goes There?" from whence it was based, is far more magical and encompassing than "The Thing [From Another World]" from the 50's.This is one of those all-rare instances in Hollywood where the special effects SUPPORT the story instead of take its place. They serve to enhance the movie experience, and suspend your disbelief entirely. If John Carpenter never makes another good film (he hasn't since), he can go to his reward knowing he made this one. Solid acting,editing, music, and top-notch special effects highlight this film: one of science fiction's greatest movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would have to say that I do generally like John Carpenter's films, and I feel that when he has a good script to work with, he can make an intense movie. This is by far my favorite of his. Usually a film like this becomes very dated very fast. And I'm talking about special effects, sound, visuals, the works. This one though is differant for me. The special effects are some of the best makeup effects (which I prefer to CG) I've ever seen, and the visuals are beautiful and bleak. The only real thing that seems to date this film is the clothing and the shots of the "high tech" electronics. If you can get past these minor things, you will find that this is a gem of a film. The story is intense, the acting is top notch, the cinematography and direction are good, and the score, a staple of every John Carpenter film, is as haunting as ever. It's a shame that more people don't recognize this movie for the wonderful film that it is, and in my opinion, on of the best in it's catagories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carpenter has officially blown me away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've known who John Carpenter is since I was a kid-- a very young kid. My parents let me watch "Halloween" and "Escape From New York," which was one of my late father's favorites, maybe too young for some, but with a crowd that made them 'just a movie.' Yet, when I tried to watch "The Thing" at a young age, I was so disturbed I couldn't bare it. It didn't have the hero of Snake, or the novelty of Michael. Not that it was overtly realistic, but it started a little too slow, and then the whole things with the dogs happened... We had too many dogs at the time for me not to be disturbed... I quit, and hung it up until yesterday.Now, I'm in film school, last semester we had an assignment to match the lighting techniques in "Halloween," and since I've revisited many of my old Carpenter favorites (and realize I still know "Escape From New York" by heart, and it's been years since I've seen it.) But, given the IMDB high ratings every time I went to his name, I decided to check it out."The Thing" is bar-none one of the most brilliant films I've ever seen, and certainly the best John Carpenter movie out there. The F/X are one thing, a brilliant thing, but the film doesn't rely soley on them at all. The cinematographery and the narrative are the leads. (Take out "The Thing," and you still have a story. The sub-plot alone could be the story-- guys cracking up under stressful conditions in the wilderness.)The film looks pitched in low key light under extremely high key weather conditions. The interior scenes look like they were done at the same location, although they weren't. That pitch helps with the clausterphobic atmosphere, but also the dark mood of the story even before it happens.I won't go with any spoilers, I am against them. But, the film's narrative starts at a level of distant, unaware, and unsure charactors and ends in a dark level of distant, unaware, enlightenment. Nothing else matters to the lead. Kurt Russell in no way displays the heroics 'I don't give a damn' attitude he did as Snake. He's burned out and it doesn't matter any more. He's still the hero, and not an anti-hero, because in the end he did all he could do. His means, in the end, did not justify his end-- and he states that well before the film ends.The gore was harsh, but is well worth it, and amazingly real in and unrealistic circumstance of the main plot. I'm not a Sci-Fi fan, I rarely get scared by a movie (and there are some moments that honestly scare the hell out of me, even when they are predictable. It's the old Hitchcock 'bomb under the desk' trick.)Also, the DVD is highly recommended. The documentary is a little slow, but ends up very interesting, especially when talking about the F/X, done by one man who was about seven years younger than me at the time.Lastly, I want to mention that like many brilliant achievements by previously known directors, the film has much the same feel as some of his previous works at first-- music, shots, and pacing especially. When you realize, however, that Carpenter didn't embark in the same direction as usual, realize that he didn't use tactics that had already worked before-- by himself or anyone else-- on probably the biggest budget he had had before that time. Instead, Carpenter went darker and more realistic than ever before. That's rare with independent directors of today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror film that stands the test of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Less than successful on release, "The Thing" is a horror film that really stands the test of time. Its special effects (which are key to the atmosphere of the film) haven't dated that badly at all and don't distract the watcher from the film with too much obvious "fakeness". That's not to say everything looks ultra-real, but given that two decades has passed since the original release, this movie has done pretty well.The major attraction to this film is its atmosphere. Stuck on an ice base with an alien that can impersonate anyone, a type of claustrophobic paranoia starts to take shape. This is aided that characters will disappear for long times only to reappear later and not all the action is shown - the audience is never quite sure who hasn't been contaminated."They Thing" is a seminal horror film that relies on tension rather than gore to draw the audience in. It's a pity that not more horror directors haven't learned from this film (and what's even worse is that Carpenter himself seems to have forgotten too!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I LOVE This Film, one of the 25 Best Films of all Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot believe I never added my two cents about this film as yet!This is one of the best films of all time. Many critics and movie-goers alike talk of John Carpenter's "Halloween" for setting trends and being "his best work". Those folks have not seen this version of "The Thing" because it is right up there with "Halloween".John Carpenter's work shines in this film. He took a film that was already made and instead of "re-making" the film, he made the book the first film was based on! Brilliant.The casting of each man was great, the tension between them was real, it made me scream, made me scared, made me guess, made me laugh, made me question, even up to today "who goes there?" in that film. This film had no Hollywood sweetie pie or funny-type ending, and what a bold move not to have one in 1982. Another brilliant move.I was at the screening for this film when I was on vacation in Southern California. The audience at the screening went wild! I carry those memories for years, it was so much fun! We all thought that there was no way on God's green earth this film was not going to be a hit. But by box office receipts, it was a dud because of "ET, The Extra Terrestrial" and "Poltergeist" two very good family oriented films took the box office in 1982 when this film came out.This film was what I, as a horror film adult buff was looking for, a horror/thriller with an adult script, and real adult actors. Not kids playing adults. Not little Miss "big-breasted" scream-queen of the day running around screaming for titilation BUT real guys with real problems delivering some of the best monologues you'll ever hear. Heck, being a feminist, I didn't even MISS women in this film! And good for Mr. Carpenter by not putting one in there, it really wouldn't have made sense! (Unless, "The Thing" was actually feminine! Something to think about!)I saw special effects of that time I had never seen before, I saw makeup that made me sit up a few nights. This is what horror/thrillers of today are missing. Today, the Directors wimp out. Today, the Studios wimp out. Too much CGI and not enough belief, too much CGI and not enough story, not enough imagination. You leave the theater and in a week -- or less -- you forget about the film and move onto the next grand film opening. This one stays with ya. That's one of the marks of an excellent film.On many reviews I've written how now paying $10 for a film is horrid. For films like this one, you'd pay it and not feel slighted. This film is NOT for everyone.I find it horrific that they lable this film a "cult" film. I find that the audience is broader than many would lead you to belive and although not a commercial success in 1982, this is an example of how releasing a darn good film on the wrong date can make a darn good film look bad. After John Carpenter's film, many people copied many techniques, make-up, special effects and story lines from this version of "The Thing".I am now excitd to go on record and state that this film is one of the best films of all time, very much under rated. Please see it uncut, please see it in letterbox and please hear it digitally. You'll talk about it for years as well.</fullReview>

This bears no resemblance to the late 40s classic which featured James Arness as a dangerous, alien vegetable in the Arctic. Rather it is a modern version of the the original 1930's novella and follows its story line extremely well but for the likewise modern, but more cynical ending.A combo of science fiction and horror that is very frightening and could be thought of as plausible if you have an imagination and enjoy this genre.The cast led by Kurt Russell does a marvelous job and the screenplay is excellent altho some might be offended by some excessive profanity in the original release.

		<shortDescription>An unfairly under-appreciated modern horror classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many have written John Carpenter's version of The Thing off as an overly gory remake of the 1950's horror 'classic'. What these people have failed to realize is that, unlike the vastly overrated and campy Howard Hawks version, The Things' scripters actually read their source material, John W. Campbell's classic sci-fi tale, "Who Goes There". You will be hard pressed to find a film that remains so faithful to the text off which it is based. Everything is meticulously captured, from the utter desolation of the Antarctic to the grotesque, Kafka-esque imagery of the monster itself. The cast offers genuinely solid performances, making for a horror movie that does what a horror movie should: frighten the audience while having them sympathize with the plight of the cast. Despite its gore, the film keeps strength in characterization, making death scenes and creature attacks more tragic. Those who write this film off as an overly gory remake should learn what makes a good HORROR film and read the original story off which the film is based. This isn't a remake. It's Hollywood finally doing the story justice after its butchering in the 1950's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember when I first saw John Carpenter's The Thing back in 1994. It was scary because it was the first time I saw it and i was only 8 years old. Now I'm 15 and I sat down and watched it and promised myself that I'd sit through it. When I finally watched it, I realized it wasn't so scary, except for the dog kennel scene. I give The Thing a 4 out of 5 because you have to give Carpenter credit for the grotesque special effects. Everything in The Thing is perfect. SPOILER ALERT My only major complaint about it is Death of Nauls scene. When MacReady, Nauls and Garry are setting the charges, Garry's headlight dies and Blair comes out of nowhere and kills Garry. When Nauls realizes Garry is missing, he doesn't bother to alert MacReady that Garry is missing. Then Nauls is attacked by the thing. This is the one aspect of the film that I am disappointed with. Other than this flaw, The Thing is a great horror film with a great cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no question about it, THE THING is one of the best horror movies ever made. This film is the culmination of director John Carpenter's talents; a truly horrific tale that will keep you up at night.An isolated Antarctic research station is the site of the film, where a skeleton crew of biologists and researchers find that a shape shifting alien is among them. No one can trust anyone as the monster purposely pits the men against one another.The monster is downright scary to look at, and monster creators Stan Winston and Rob Bottin uses their special effect skills to the max. Kurt Russell is in top form as the voice of reason (or the closest thing you can find to one in this place of terror). Keith David and Wilford Brimley are also excellent standouts in this talented cast.Ignore the fact that the film originally bombed at the box office; that was due to E.T. opening before it and changing the image of aliens into a more family friendly appeal. I have never seen another film that has captured paranoia so well. This truly is one of the finest films the horror genre has ever produced, and you can tell by how many times is ripped-off (THE RELIC, DEEP RISING, VIRUS, etc) that it is highly influential.If you haven't seen it, you're missing one of the finest scary movies ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carpenter's best film. One of the best films of the 80s. In a word: amazing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter is a master of the medium of film, and specifically the widescreen format. This is quite apparent in his 1982 remake of The Thing... He bypasses the Howard Hawks original, taking only the name, and bases his film on the short novel that Hawks' film is based on: Who Goes There? by J. Campbell.Carpenter's visual composition, editing, pacing, and characterization are nothing short of flawless. He handles themes of identity, isolation, and trust without becoming overtly preachy.In short, the film is beautiful. It is now available in widescreen on VHS and DVD so I suggest you only watch that. It deserves to be seen in all its claustrophobic glory.(NOTE: If you're a fan of special effects, this film should be number one on your "must watch" list. The make-up effects and (subtle) matte work are top-notch.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Thing" is John Carpenter's best movie. Merging his talents for tension building and shocks with decent production values he turned out a perfectly crafted sci fi / horror movie.By filming in truly difficult conditions he creates a very believable isolated research base which sets the tension before anything has even happened. The ensemble cast work well together with Kurt Russell proving a charismatic leading man even under all that beard.By building the tension slowly with moments of gory horror (courtesy of effects meister Rob Bottin - currently directing Freddy vs Jason) Carpenter creates a movie that has rarely been matched. Considering this came out the same year as ET it could not be more different!Worth a watch / rewatch. 9 out of 10.p.s. the DVD is excellent. Lots of extras plus the best DVD commentary going (with Carpenter &amp; Russell). Plus remixed in Dolby Digital for even scarier sound effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding - the greatest alien horror film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film accidentally when they showed it on TV and I was up far too late... I really lucked out there though. It's truly incredible; from the location (as isolated as it's possible to be on this planet; it made "the abyss" look like ET in the council swimming pool), through the interesting characters (Keith David is especially good as the reactionary Childs -"What if we're wrong about him?" - "Then we're wrong.") and the effects (more yucky than Alien).Moreover, however, the real tension and fear in the film has nothing to do with the effects. It's the people you start being scared of; knowing that one of them may - or may not be - "All they appear to be". It's certainly got the feel of "who goes there?".The soundtrack is great; it really plays up the isolation, fear, and gravity of the situation.Finally, the epilogue scene really, really cuts. Even more than the "But then again who does ?" punchline of Bladerunner. Enough said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It couldn't.From the cutting dialogue to the super special effects this film was a joy to behold throughout. The immediate feel for the bitterness of the antarctic, the affinity for the characters that is built up at the base level before the real action heats up and the cunning finale combine to make this one of the most memorable and enjoyable films around.Up against a long list of films that have attempted to exploit the theme of visitors from another planet, The Thing comes out on top and laughing. Who can forget the perfectly timed dialogue and the chilling special effects? Special effects that are a lot more impressive than the computer generated images that we get to see today. I for one found some of the most enjoyable aspects of the film to be the way that we were introduced slowly to each member of the crew, and the way that they all had some distinctive character traits. This wasn't just a senseless bloodbath-come-slasher-horror flick. This film had feeling. Emotion.I truly can't recommend this film highly enough. I have yet to see anything in it's class that comes anywhere near to matching, let alone bettering, the near perfect acting and timing utilised in this cunning polymesmeric feat of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When John Carpenter's masterly version of "The Thing" was released in summer 1982, it was panned by critics and bombed at the box office. The audiences couldn't handle another 'bad' alien, they wanted ET. Their loss in the long run.I would kill to be able to see this great movie on the big screen. This is a movie that was way ahead of it's time; now it has influenced a new generation of filmmakers, showing it's trail on things like "Se7en", "Alien 3", and even "The X Files", which unceremoniously ripped it off page by page. And the structure, which eschews character development in favour of incredible SFX, is commonplace in today's blockbuster flicks.Carpenter shows the same skills he honed in "Halloween", using the camera to create an unsettling and claustrophobic atmosphere. The performances are all fine, and the ending is terrific - still unique today.A paranoid masterpiece.</fullReview>

It's what true horror is all about....fear of the unknown, not being able to trust those around you and the struggle just to stay alive. The effects by Rob Bottin are unequaled to this day. There are a number of classic scenes &amp; lines, essential ingredients to a great film, with the blood-testing scene the most suspenseful scene in film history. Kurt Russell is stand-out, as is the rest of the cast, totally believable in such incredible situations.

		<shortDescription>Simultaneously scary and fun thriller manages to send shivers down your spine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A thoroughly enjoyable horror masterpiece conceived by the one and only John Carpenter (HALLOWEEN, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK). THE THING is a great horror movie with plenty of spine tingling chills, and much genuine suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat. State-of-the-art special effects and make FX provided by Rob Bottin (ROBOCOP, TOTAL RECALL) help propel THE THING above the usual films of the science-fiction/horror genre."The Thing" has been discovered by a dozen explorers at the Arctic. They've made a startling unveiling of a mysterious life-form...but little do they realize the destructive capabilities of this creature. This alien creature is so malevolent that as it mutates, it assimilates the form of its nearest, most unlucky victim. Later, the creature masquerades itself as whatever the life-form it has consumed and deformed. The leader of this expedition, Kurt Russell (STARGATE, SOLDIER), must deploy the explorers into employing ways to stop this alien mutant before it's evil spreads into worldwide, global proportions. However, as the toll rises, any one of Russell's colleagues...may in fact, be part of the demon already...THE THING is an engrossing horror film with some of the most grotesque special effects seen on the screen. The literally eye-popping effects include melting faces, cremations, walking heads, deformity, heads bursting out of stomachs, and other sequences too gruesome to print in words alone. THE THING though, has been sadly criticized by film connoisseurs as merely exercise of disgusting special effects. In my sincere and humble opinion, THE THING is a film with more substance than what most movie critics have said.This film is a parable. The expedition must learn to trust one another and stick together in order to essentially survive. Another interesting aspect about THE THING is that this movie shows what would happen if fear and isolation conquer a whole group. The consequences are devastating, people end up fighting each other and debating violently, instead of trying to work together to alleviate the problem. This film conveys a lesson saying that trusting one another and teamwork are the two main components for survival against the odds. Without those two traits, then everything else, even technology itself...is meaningless...THE THING is a great movie to watch in the dark during midnight. You will be guaranteed to jump out of your seat at least a few times. THE THING delivers its fair shares of shocks and jolts.Although the story-line in this film is not very efficient, it doesn't distract from the tension and suspense of this movie. If you enjoy truly frightening horror films with AWESOME special effects, then THE THING is a highly recommended movie perfect for you.WARNING: If you have a modicum of squeamishness inside you, then steer clear of THE THING. Otherwise, get ready for an exciting and suspenseful presentation. Plenty of effort integrated into this film, thanks to the direction of John Carpenter, and the believable performances of the main characters including Russell, Wilford Brimley, Keith David, Donald Moffat, Richard Dysart, and the rest of the cast.RATING: **1/2 out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfortunately, Sci-Fi doesn't get much better than this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ironically, what makes John Carpenter's "The Thing" such an entertaining sci-fi film are its genre-defying elements of mystery, suspense, and tight plot structure. It puts to shame such films as "Aliens" or "Armageddon" that are content to inundate the viewer with special effects while their plots revolve around stunts that butcher the laws of physics, testosterone-laden one-liners, heroes equipped with enough artillery to conquer Iraq, and pathetic attempts to inject "meaning" into the barrage on screen with "emotional sequences" that only serve to further insult the intelligence of the audience. The supreme tragedy, of course, is that these kind of lobotomized movies are also the most popular. I think that there is a cause for this, although it isn't very comforting. There is an increasing trend in our culture to passively "surrender" to the media -- to immerse oneself in the images we see without dedicating a single brain cell to comprehending the statement the work is trying to make. This mindset is becoming increasingly dominant in all arenas; even the once-hallowed print medium is being diluted, thanks to the abominable "reader response" theory that pervades our schools and the "tabloid brigade" that lines our magazine racks whose mentality appears to be infiltrating the once-venerable mainstream press. Nowadays, we just flip the switch and put our minds on "pause." Is "The Thing" a "good" movie? For the rare individual who still values his faculty of reason, a more appropriate term would be "entertaining." Its plot keeps one guessing, its ending is uncompromising, and it has some redeeming statements to make about human paranoia. Upon subsequent viewings, one begins to note a conspicuous lack of depth in the acting, but the taut storyline remains compelling. Of course, "Citizen Kane" it's not, but then again sci-fi never was a thinking-man's genre...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After the contamination of a scientific Arctic team from an unknown alien creature, the group must figure out who is really who in order to stay alive.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the early Fall of 1978, Terrence Malick (Badlands, A Thin Red Line) released his take on deception and turmoil on a rural farm with Days of Heaven, which featured the young faces of Richard Gere and Brooke Adams. Accompanying the 29 year old actors is a majestic and graceful score by Italian composer Ennio Morricone, who created one of the most iconic sounds in a new generation of Westerns. Around this time, a bright eyed and passionate director began piecing together one of the most memorable scores for a film that would become one of the most iconic slashers of our time. Four years later, both masters of iconicism would join hands melding Morricone's strings with Carpenter's terror, creating one of the greatest pieces of science fiction horror cinema has ever seen.Taking place at United States National Science Institute Station 4 in Antarctica, a helicopter manned by a Norwegian sniper attempts to shoot a wild dog making its way to the research station. After a brief shootout, the Alaskan Malamute is taken in by gruff sled-dog handler Clark (Richard Masur), while fellow researcher Dr. Copper (Richard Dysart) and helicopter pilot R. J. MacReady (Kurt Russel) investigate a nearby Norwegian research facility. Finding the entire camp in ruin, and a mysterious, twisted corpse containing two faces lying amidst the charred facility, they fly it back for Dr. Blair (Wilfrud Brimley) to look at. Soon afterwards the dog, now caged with the others and containing the creature, mutates into a biomass of flesh and bone that is quickly contained by a flamethrower wielding Childs (Keith David). The creatures autopsy reveals that the thing inside of the animal can mimic other life forms, putting the rest of the crew on edge as they quickly try and figure out who the creature has infected.Originally a short story entitled Who Goes There? by John W. Campbell Jr., The Thing is a remake of a 1951 science fiction film The Thing From Another Planet by Howard Hawkes and Christian Nyby. Playing more closely to the story Hawkes and Nyby adapted, John Carpenter weaves a beautiful tapestry of twisted design between a veil of claustrophobia as each member of the research team becomes more and more paranoid over who is who. As the creature makes itself apparent, showing us one beautiful transformation after the other, the room we are given to move around is slowly cut off, adding to the creeping feeling of isolation and hopelessness.With the tension John Carpenter and screenwriter Bill Lancaster creates as things unfold is all too palpable, causing each scene to build on top of each other in Jenga like fashion. What stirs each paranoid glance, each unsure movement, and what ultimately goes bump in the night is Ennio Morricone's magnificent post-Western score, raising hairs with each sound. Whether it's a wide shot of the frozen Arctic tundra or a close-up of the thing ripping out of a fellow teammate, the music behind each scene raises it to new heights that only a master composer could.Just as The Thing is a film that you can watch, it is also one you can listen to and feel, with each contribution working with equal and powerful forces. Ranging from suffocating tension to grotesque and sudden outbursts, every frame is one for your senses. While Todd C. Ramsay's editing comes off as a bit too ill-guided, forcing multiple scenes transitioning to pick up too many pieces, it doesn't cause us to deviate from the story. Whether it's John Carpenters patient build up, Rob Bottin's and Stan Winston's horrifying and undeniably ahead of its times special effects, or Ennio Morricone's hair raising score, The Thing is a film that cannot be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Suspense: It Will Rattle Your Teeth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:Want to know the power of good acting? Watch the remake first, then watch this one and ask yourself why does the remake fail? It has far superior effects to this one, no contest. Yet, it was a huge bomb; it is already forgotten and it has been such a short time. In order to make suspense real the actors need to know how to behave oddly and make you suspicious of them. In this one, with Brimley, Masur and Childs, you have gifted character actors that are able to convey odd, suspicious behavior. The first time you watch this you will never know who is who. This is what makes it so terrifying; also, Carpenter mixes in a few pop out scares. If you blend in on of the best actors of my generation, Kurt Russell, you get one scary movie. Never underestimate Ennio Morricone's music; it is what made the Sergio Leone films so powerful. He wrote a really creepy score. It really enhances the terror. It is so superior to the boring, overrated original by Howard Hawks and the dreadful remake. It starts right away no build up; from the first frame, Morricone's music with that ominous beat, the who is who game begins. The photography is the other star of the movie; watch for the creepy shots of the dog. After you have seen it a few times, you find yourself watching the dog. Then, you see how you should have known who was who better. Even the dog is shot very well; the effects while dated, and nowhere near the remake, are still well done. This was Carpenter's first big budget movie. It did not do very well because it was considered far too gory for the year of 1982.I still prefer Escape From New York but this is very close. The first time you watch it, it will scare you, I guarantee it. The acting is what makes the difference; these are very skilled character actors. The new one just collapsed under the weight of the dreadful, bad acting cast. If only young filmmakers would see that effects are worthless unless we care about the characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The great horror called The Thing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing about the thing is that the thing can look like any living thing. John Carpenter's 'The Thing' is the best scifi-horror movie after Ridley Scott's 'Alien'. I haven't seen any other film by Carpenter but now I am keen as 'The Thing' portrays his talent exponentially. The amount of suspense that gets built here is monumental and that's the ace-point of the film.The film is set entirely in Antarctica where the researchers encounter a strange alien creature called 'The Thing' that can mimic any living thing.It kills the person it copies before taking the form. The cold and isolated location on Antarctica where the events take place induces the scary atmosphere. The music is even more haunting. There is lot of gore so have a strong stomach. Seriously, the detailing is too much. There are many moments in the film where no one has any idea whom the thing has mimicked and the suspense is at its peak.The only major problem with the film is that its doesn't induce varied characterization. There are 12 researchers and none of them stands out among the rest.I don't mean the acting was bad which by the way was excellent, but all of them have similar expression there is no unique character.Also some more interesting sub-plot development was possible which I would liked more, anyways the film is kept tight.The Thing is a must-watch for horror fans and rest can also give it go if they can handle the gore.RATING:[4/5]</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Barf-bag splatter flick: Cult film but no classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's update of 'Who Goes There' and 'The Thing From Another World' came out 31 years ago to seemingly little fan-fare and even less critical reception. Steven Spielberg's 'E.T.' released the same year was a more popular take on the alien invasion story. Apparently people weren't too keen on seeing hideous creatures from outer space wreaking havoc in the same way.Which is a shame, because 'The Thing' has a lot going for it. The opening sequence with a pair of Norwegians in a helicopter chasing down a sled dog, with the steady synthesized beat of the soundtrack, proves something eerie, and leads into a brilliant set up.Unfortunately, once things go wrong and sh*t hits the fan, the paper thin characterizations of the cast come to the forefront. All of these 'scientists' and researchers on this base are rather bland, and the viewer never gets a sense of having known these guys. For example, in 'Alien', you feel like there is real camaraderie among the crew of the Nostromo, with subtle rivalries and edgy small talk providing so much detail and backstory to their characters (much of it ad libbed). But in 'The Thing', you never get a chance to hear these guys talk, or develop as interesting human beings at all. The most you see is them playing ping pong or getting high. The only insightful one is Kurt Russell's "Macready". Everyone else is simply fodder for the alien.Carpenter seems to rely on mantaining the viewer's interest with the next highly inventive, but over the top special effects gore scene. Some say that "the less you see, the more frightening it is". Well someone forgot to tell Carpenter this on set, because each creature appearance is gooier and more in-your-face than the last. Even worse is the concept of the shape-shifting alien itself. It seemingly has the ability to transform into whatever shape with whatever powers it wants. A lot of it seems to depend on the amount of material (people) it absorbs, but in some cases the survival of the characters seems entirely arbitrary and not down to the rules that should have been established in the beginning. The main concept is that each piece of the alien is a living whole. But the film doesn't account for the idea that even the tiniest, invisible molecules that float through the air are part alien. And if the alien transmits itself through bodily fluids, why can't it just breathe onto someone and absorb them that way. Because of this and the weakly written roles, the atmosphere of paranoia and claustrophobia that should be developing is instead undercooked, and leads to many of the characters going crazy and acting unrealistically way too soon.It's literally only 10 minutes into the assimilation process, when one key scientist character realizes that mankind would be doomed within a year of the alien reaching the mainland. So what does he do? Round everyone up like a sensible person and try to weed out the alien? No, he suddenly destroys the radio and the helicopter, therefore dooming his companions to be trapped on a remote base with an enemy they can't see. Oh, and he tries to kill them all.Of course, the alien isn't too smart either. Rather than laying low and maintaining its disguise, it would rather transform at the most inopportune moments to get itself destroyed.Honestly, the film has little depth to its story or plot, and is really just a B-grade slasher flick, like Carpenter's last film 'Halloween'. With characters that seemingly want to die, how else could you describe it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meandering, slow, sci-fi tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of several of John Carpenter's early oeuvre of works (Halloween, The Fog, Big Trouble in Little China, They Live), I've got to say that I was disappointed in recently getting around to watching his remake of THE THING (1982) and am a tad surprised by how revered this movie is. Having seen the original 1951 Howard Hawks' classic a few times, I was stunned that Carpenter's remake is actually SLOWER than the original film, which moves at a brisker pace, never lets up, and is still fun to watch even over 60s years later! Don't get me wrong, I don't mind a "slow" film if there's a method to the madness, but there is none here. The Thing just drags and drags and drags and really goes nowhere.Not to mention, I was not much impressed by the casting in this 1982 remake. I thought most of the performances were rather monotonous and lifeless throughout, which a bunch of interchangeable characters. Even the usually reliable Kurt Russell really brought very little to the table in terms of personality. The ONLY character the remotely piqued my interest was the one played by the veteran actor Wilfrid Brimley, and low and behold, Carpenter sidelined him for virtually the entire 2nd and 3rd acts! Other than the talented Brimley, the rest of the cast was literally just there.Getting off to an interesting start, with an alien spaceship hurtling toward Earth, we are immediately introduced to the crew of an Antarctic research and discovery station, who witness the pilot of a helicopter from a nearby station shooting at a seemingly harmless dog. The station captain kills the pilot and they take in the dog, who turns out is an alien beast that kills it's prey, then replicates them in every detail. So that this remake ends up functioning as a mystery-whodunit, as the station crew become paranoid (although it's hard to tell through all the mediocre acting) for the rest of the movie not knowing who is really who.I found this remake to be overly long and very slow. It literally got to a point where I thought the film was over, then it went on for about another 45 minutes! Some of the stuff in the climax was kind of interesting, whittling down the crew to the remaining "humans", but the getting there was very tedious. I found it strange that as soon as they found out they were dealing with an alien life form, none of them seem flabbergasted or blown away by their discovery. Also, I wondered why they didn't try harder to call for help as the alien threat became increasingly ominous. Plus, the ending left a LOT to be desired. A bit too ambiguous even for my taste. Also, the initially shocking, gory effects wore off quickly as the film progressed and became redundant.Carpenter's film usually have a penchant for thrills and suspense (see aforementioned movies of his that I actually LIKE in my first paragraph), but this one strangely left me cold (pardon the pun!). However, I do give it points (thus, the 5 out of 10 rating), for having some obviously unique (if a bit too gory) effects and piquing my interest early on, just not being able to maintain my attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What to do, when you can't escape or trust anybody?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First time round, in 1982, this was a scary movie. Having seen it again, recently, it's not as scary as, say, Hallloween (1978), Alien (1979) and others. More importantly, nearly thirty years later, it's now much easier for me to spot the shortcomings of the narrative.But, I'll ignore those so as not to spoil the story which I first saw in the 1951 version (largely produced by Howard Hawks). For its time, that also was a scary movie (for a ten year old) which also served as a political metaphor about the dangers of the Soviet Union and communism. This 1982 version, however, avoids that trap by eliminating all of the military aspects so prevalent in the earlier version.Essentially, the story follows the book written by John Campbell quite well (unlike the 1951 production), showing how a particularly vicious alien attempts to take over and literally absorb ? into itself ? the scientists and support personnel at an American Antarctic base station. In a series of graphically violent situations, we see how the alien infiltrates and, when finding one of the humans alone, attacks, envelops and eventually takes on the physical appearance of its victims.Hence, creeping paranoia and mutual distrust invade the humans. And, very cleverly, the script and direction make sure that, as viewers, we can never be entirely certain about the true identity of each character as the story reaches its inevitable conclusion ? and, by implication, beyond.The special alien effects are still worthy of special mention, particularly as it was all done without any help from CGI. The early scene in the dog pen, when we first see the nasty beast, can never be forgotten, I think; the destroyed Norwegian base camp is suitably spooky and scary; and the scene where MacReady (Kurt Russell) conducts his own blood tests to weed out the good humans from the bad ones is a tour de force in suspense. Added to all of that is Ennio Morricone's brooding, throbbing, menacing sound track ? pervasively shadowing the action, its beat emphasizing the time ticking away as the desperate men battle each other and the alien.Arguably, this is equally a movie about terror as much as horror: the terror of the malevolent unknown, and the horror of one's fellow man taking on the guise of that malevolence. To cap it all, there is no escape, even for the survivors ? who may or may not be human anyway. Make your own assessment if you see this movie from John Carpenter, one of the true masters of terror and horror.Recommended for all lovers of sci-fi who like to be scared witless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter's The Thing is an entertainingly gore-drenched horror flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just rewatched Howard Hawks' The Thing from Another World, I finally decided to see John Carpenter's The Thing on the HD DVD my dad ordered months ago. In this version, the title alien starts to inhabit many of the dogs and people that are stationed in the Antarctic Circle. Among the crew: R. J. MacReady (Kurt Russell), Nauls (T. K. Carter), Dr. Blair (A. Wilford Brimley without his familiar mustache and glasses), Vance Norris (Charles Hallahan), Garry (Donald Moffat), Clark (Richard Masur), Dr. Cooper (Richard Dysart), and others. I'll stop there and just say how fascinatingly weird and gory this movie is. I mean from the dog scene to yet another creature-coming-out-of-someone's-body sequence, there's plenty of entertaining blood-drenched visual effects courtesy of Rob Bottin and Stan Winston. And the pulsating score of Ennio Morricone is positively riveting. I can't always make sense of the dialogue in Bill Lancaster's screenplay but as long as those monster effects come on, I'm never bored. So on that note, I highly recommend John Carpenter's The Thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember watching this film when i was 14 and i genuinely thought this was the greatest Horror film i had ever seen, twelve years later i brought and watched it again and it still is. This in my opinion is John Carpenters best film (thou Halloween is excellent). This film has it all scares great special effect a very creepy atmosphere and a sense of claustrophobia, as for the cast the main star is Kurt Russell but to be fair the rest of the cast are all just as important and play there roles very well believing they are scared for there lives. I don't want go into the story i think i would just ruin it for people who have not seen The Thing but i would recommend it for anyone who is a horror fan or for that matter a movie fan. I know there are so many old horror been remade at the minute, so i would just like to say please leave this classic alone, instead give it the credit it really deserves.PS DON'T TRUST ANYBODY.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Winter, Antartica. A group of scientists and pilots are stationed in a US observation post. With the arrival of a seemingly insane Norweigen helicopter crew shooting wildly at a fleeing husky dog the film starts with violence. The dog runs in to the American base prompting the hysterical rifleman to chase after him, firing blindly. Garry the base officer shoots and kills him. After trying to radio out for advice on how to proceed the base radio operator 'Windows' tells them he has been getting nothing but static for two weeks. Concerned at this crews seemingly randomly insane behaviour, Dr Copper wants to check on the Norweigen crew at their base in case anyone else is hurt, recruiting helicoper pilot McReady to shuttle him. The Norweigen base is destroyed, decimated by fire. Searching the ruins they see the grisly sight of a man who has cut his throat and wrists in an apparent suicide..what happened here to make a man do this to himself. Could they have all gone crazy out here in the frozen wilderness?. Outside they come across what appears to be the burnt remains of several men , they wrap it up and take it back for examination. Later Fuchs the dog handler takes the dog which has been wandering aimlessly about the base and puts it with the other huskies. Checking on the animal later to see how it is settling in he is confronted with something out of a nightmare..something is killing the dogs . The men spring in to action and use a flamethrower on the monster they find, but not before it cleaves off a part of itself and disappears through the roof of the dog shed. Blair the biologist does an autopsy of the dogs mangled remains and makes a horrific discovery. The dogs were not being attacked they were being taken over by this creature, and then imitated. After further research in to the imitations capabilities Blair comes to the stark conclusion ..if one single cell of this imitator reaches a populated area in 27,000 hours it will have imitated the entire population of the earth. And there is further bad news, there is a 75% chance that one or more members of the crew have now been imitated. With this realisation paranoia descends on the crew as they realise this alien can imitate anyone of them perfectly and no one would know until it is too late. With trust gone, how will the men survive ?. Part of John Carpenters 'Apocolypse Trilogy' ( the other two being; In The Mouth Of Madness and Escape From L.A) The Thing is his masterwork. A brilliant adaptation of sci-fi short story 'Who Goes There?'. Focusing on the paranoia of an enclosed group who are isolated from civilisation and the authoritys by their environment. And this is interesting, when the alien(s) can look like anybody who can you trust?. Certainly not the head of the base Garry ( brilliantly played by the reliable Donald Moffat) who the group begin to suspect when the blood is contaminated. There are no square jawed heroics in this bleak film, the characters are all ordinary men thrust in to a terrifying situation with a creature they have no control over. A being who lives by taking over, then imitating others. Ruthless decisions are made and made quickly. McReady is the loner alcoholic pilot who takes control when others refuse it. But we see he is doing this for one reason only- to protect his own hide. When push comes to shove ( and it does) Mcready is more than willing to kill any of his co-workers if he suspects one of them is a Thing. The Thing is clever and manipulative and uses the mens suspicion of each other to divide them, getting them alone so it can attack and imitate.. The acting in this movie is excellent, all the actors working at the peak of their powers to create realistic , physical characters with all their flaws and pettiness. Kurt Russell turns in one of his best performances as the pilot McReady a man who is not to be crossed when the chips are down. The ending is bleak and ambiguous. With the fires dying down and the temperature dropping Childs and McReady seemed fated to die. Is one of them an imitation?. This film will have you talking afterwards, would we all react the same in similar situations, turning on each other?. This remains my favourite John Carpenter movie and one of my favourite films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carpenter's masterpiece of paranoia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though it didn't attract audience and mostly received bad critics,John Carpenter's The Thing is now considered as a masterpiece about human nature and paranoia.At least,it's a masterpiece to me and it's one of my all time favorites.Carpenter creates a chilling atmosphere which he does best and he focuses on twelve men working in a research station in Antarctica with nowhere to run.When they find an unknown organism,they took it to the station with the hope that they could've made the discovery of the century.But when the frozen organism is thawed out,the trouble begins.From that point,the movie gets very different from it's predecessor which was a Howard Hawks (Carpenter's favorite) production.The thing was a monster in shape in the original film and the crew was fighting against something they could see,but in Carpenter's version,the thing has a deadly weapon;it can imitate any living creature it wants.After they learn the terrifying truth about their guest,the crew loses trust for each other and this keeps the tension always high.Members of the crew fall apart and they begin to accuse each other of being an alien instead of acting like a team.With this masterpiece,Carpenter accomplishes what he always does once again;he scares us to death.While doing this,he also shows what a human being is capable of(lies,mistrust,even murder)and how easy they can forget some basic moral values when they feel they're in danger.Kurt Russell stars as R.J.MacReady;the helicopter pilot who tries to hold the men together in order to fight against the thing and gives one of the greatest performances of his career.The cast also includes some well known character actors like Wilford Brimley,Richard Masur,Keith David (also appeared in Carpenter's They live),Richard Dysart and Donald Moffat.Unlike his other movies,Carpenter didn't compose the music.The music belongs to a legendary composer;Ennio Morricone(you know who he is)and it provides a great support.The movies great special effects were made by Rob Bottin and his work is still remembered as a milestone.The Thing is a masterpiece from a master film maker and will always remain as one of the scariest movies about human nature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I literally had to sleep with the lights on for 3 nights (i saw this at its release in a drive in). This movie sets the bar for paranoia &amp; nerve racking. I have the first DVD that is pictured here yet am dying to see the latest super special directors redone version which netflix does not have.Nothing scared me like this till the I saw the Grudge &amp; house of 1000 corpses which came close but The Thing really has staying power. Its ancient effects are still terrifying &amp; the great cast does a fine job of instilling fear in the viewer.I think this is one of the finest horror/sci-fi films ever made, &amp; am glad to see it start to get the recognition it deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revenge of the 80's meet The Cinema of John Carpenter: The Thing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thing (1982) was another one of those classic horror films that was being remade during the eighties. But this time hot director John Carpenter was given the green light to re-invent the film. Carpenter decided wisely to remain faithful to the original story line and created a dark and depressing movie about alien mutations and co-habitation within humans. He also create an atmosphere of hopelessness with no light at the end of the tunnel. This film is also the first part of his Apocalyptic Trilogy.A group of scientist and technicians are living inside a U.S. research base in the middle of Antarctica. Nothing but the cold and cabin fever accompanies them. One day they get a taste of excitement when a helicopter from a nearby Norwegian research base is chasing a dog. They fail to kill the dog and die in the process. The guys were left wondering why they wanted to kill that husky so bad. unfortunately they do find out but by then it's too late. A mutating copy cat alien is living within the base. One by one it kills off the crew refusing to show itself. Paranoia and madness soon sets in and no one trusts anyone. By the end of the film, the men destroy their own refuge. The last two survivors sit in the ruins not trusting one another and die in the cold Antarctic wastelands with weapons in hand waiting for the other to show their true self.Another great film from John Carpenter. Too bad he couldn't keep the streak going. His next film was a unwise choice. Due to the lack of box office drawing power, Carpenter was forced to jump on the Stephen King band wagon and adapt one of his works for the silver screen. It was a failure as well, but nowhere as cool as THE THING.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't really get this movie at all. Some even consider it a masterpiece. What?? The initial premise was interesting and I liked the snowy scenes. Reminded me of The Shining in that regard. There's something creepy about a winter landscape which can be an effective characteristic for a horror movie. But that's about as good as it gets. The characters are weak and I think the story needed more dynamics, more intrigue, more abstraction. I was hoping something more psychological perhaps e.g. the people start behaving in strange ways and "the thing" would more of a psychosis than some stupid gory blobster. Despite a few suspenseful scenes, there's nothing scary about this. I feel like I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this trash. If you want a good scary movie, just watch Kubrick's masterpiece The Shining (and watch his other films too while you're at it).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some things work, some things don't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thing is a monster movie with a twist. The monster could be the guy standing next to you. Or maybe the monster could even be you. The story unfolds at an American research outpost in Antarctica. Some crazy Norwegians show up, shooting at a dog. Before the Americans can ascertain what is going on the Norwegians are dead. Soon everyone will realize this dog is no dog at all. It's, for lack of a better term, a thing. This thing can take the appearance of other creatures it absorbs. It can become a perfect imitation of any living creature. So now how much do you trust that guy standing next to you? Paranoia overwhelms the group very quickly. This thing is, quite literally it appears, eating the group alive.Kurt Russell plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot who becomes the leader of the group as they try to stop the thing before it destroys them all. If they don't stop this thing in its tracks and it manages to make its way to civilized areas it will be the end of humankind. So some pressure on our little group then. MacReady is a take-charge kind of guy. But who's to say he's not a thing now? Certainly other members of the group have their doubts. Trust is a commodity in very short supply. Where the film fails a bit is in failing to really establish any characters beyond MacReady. A couple of them stand out because they're portrayed by actors we recognize, Wilford Brimley for example. But it's a largely faceless bunch, not a whole lot of personality in the group. And for a bunch of supposed scientists they're not the smartest group either.The movie has some decent twists and turns, leaving you guessing along with the characters as they try to determine who's still human. It's an intriguing story but it certainly would have grabbed you more if you really identified with all of the characters. As it is there are too many guys whom you really wouldn't care about should the thing make a meal of them. Characters, and the story as a whole really, too often take a backseat to the gore which director John Carpenter piles on liberally. If you're looking for a gross-out movie you'll find few better. The creature effects are very well done but maybe a little too repulsive for some people's tastes. A little more story, a little less blood and guts, probably would have served the film well. It is a very compelling story. You just wish the filmmakers trusted that story enough to allow it to carry the film. The paranoia, the mistrust, there's so much great tension there potentially. But tension loses out in the quest for gory, scary moments. In a movie such as this you want to have some good frights. But you want the scares to enhance the story, not overwhelm it. The balance in this movie is just a little bit off. It's an interesting movie but there is definitely the sense more could have been done with such a fascinating concept.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thing has an interesting start as a man makes a determined effort to kill a dog. It's a disquieting scene, creating a sense of mystery. The movie continues its sense of disquiet for a while, letting you worry without quite knowing why.Unfortunately, after that the movie becomes focused on special effects and explosions. The characters are generic, the story is a little muddled, and some of the most effective scenes are also the least realistic. For me, the most interesting thing about the movie was how much Kurt Russel looked like someone from the band the Bee Gees. I always think of his as Snake Pliskin, but here, in spite of an authoritative role and bushy beard, his baby face and blow-dried hair make him look like a Hollywood actor pretending to be a tough guy. I wish they'd made him a little scragglier. To be fair. I didn't care much for the original movie from the 1950s either. So perhaps this is just not the story for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A textbook example of suspense and horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much as Star Trek: Nemesis was released terminally close to The Two Towers and fell well below box office expectations, Universal chose to try and kill the then-rising star director John Carpenter's career by releasing The Thing a mere two weeks after a little feel-good piece called E.T. It is somewhat funny, the spin history can put on things, because now as a Lucas-like special edition has failed to reinvigorate interest in the family-friendly box office hit, The Thing has found a new life as a cult piece. This is not to put down Spielberg's career-building piece, as it is a well-made film in its own right. But years after I have forgotten Spielberg's effort, and dismissed it after he tried to make even more suitable only for infants, I still remember the mood it put me in, the first time I saw The Thing, and watched as the creepiest score I have heard in at least a thousand films played over elegantly understated credits. Put simply, The Thing should be shown to film-making students as an example of how you build suspense.The film starts out innocently enough, with what appears to be a husky running from a helicopter as a (lousy) sharpshooter tries to kill it. Running and flying into an American research station, the husky tries to bond with the present staff as the sharpshooter emerges and tries to warn them in broken-sounding Norwegian. As the helicopter is accidentally destroyed and the sharpshooter shot dead, the husky works its way into the confidence of the camp, eventually placed in the kennel at the insistence of one of its edgier residents. The new husky soon reveals itself to be an alien creature, not that this is any surprise to the audience. As the alien absorbs the other huskies, the men at the research centre are fortunate enough to get to it before it finishes. Whether one of them has already been absorbed before two of them pay a visit to the station the Norwegians came from is a matter of debate, but things take a definite turn for the worse when they bring back some artifacts from the site.Screenwriters like Ehren Kruger could learn a lot from The Thing. Although the scenario itself is incredibly harrowing, especially when you consider what could happen if the chameleon found its way into civilisation, its the details that make the story what it is. One of the men, considering the what could happen question, destroys every means the team has to call for help or leave, cutting them off completely. While most of the others do nothing quite so dramatic, their anatognism towards one another makes scenes that would normally be test patterns into something that may make viewers bite their nails. In contrast to the The Thing From Another World, this tension comes from the important fact that destroying the evil alien is almost secondary to identifying it. And in one of those happy coincidences, the scene where our hero does learn to identify the alien is far from the end of the tension. In point of fact, the scene in which he administers the test to identify who has been absored is unequalled in American film when it comes to tension. I still leap out of my seat in the quick shot where the "infected" blood sample is tested.Although it is generally bad for a film to rely on its special effects, both the story and said effects are top of the line here. The Thing was the eighth film on which Rob Bottin provided special makeup effects, and is among the films cited when his godlike reputation in the field is discussed. Regardless of whether one considers makeup effects an extension of special effects or otherwise, both can be summed up as an art where the goal is to fool people into believing they are seeing something they're not. I doubt that anyone is going to believe they are seeing an alien organism of any kind until it becomes commonplace, but like the acting, writing, and music, Bottin's artwork is a wall in a tense atmosphere that dares the viewer to look away. As in all the best films that ask the viewer to accept unreal elements, The Thing does this the right way, by suspending disbelief in graduating steps. By the time the most outrageous unrealities are unleashed upon us, we have been so drawn into the world of the story that there is no going back. It never ceases to amaze me how much the filmmakers of the 1980s could get away with in terms of stretching reality compared to their present-day cousins.This would be (at least) the third of many collaborations between Kurt Russell and John Carpenter. The two never work better than when they work together. Russell has shown a number of different modes under Carpenter's direction, from the loud arrogance of Big Trouble In Little China to the hoarse understatement of Escape From New York. In The Thing, Russell starts at the latter end of his acting spectrum and ends a couple of steps toward the former. Not that Russell is the most versatile actor in the world, but this film calls for an everyday man type, and Russell more than fits the bill. The audio commentary recorded for the Laserdisc goes into the less than noble motivations the men have for being at the research station, and Russell is best among this cast at giving the viewer a character they can see the events through the eyes of. Not that the rest of the cast let the side down in any way. Everyone from Wilford Brimley to David Clennon gives their character all three dimensions, and the story benefits enourmously from it.I gave The Thing a ten out of ten. In a season of remakes for the sake of remakes, see this for an example of a remake done right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Horror in its Purest Form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching John Carpenter's "The Thing" for at least the 25th time. I've been a huge fan of the flick since the mid 80s (I had a mad teenage crush on Kurt Russell at the time, thanks to "Escape from New York"), and I considered the John Carpenter / Kurt Russell association to be a winning one.I'm not shocked or horrified by the gore anymore, but that's only because I've seen it so many times. The gore is totally believable, and slightly understated (considering the subject matter), and there is no end to my amazement that it's just as good - if not better - than the cookie-cutter CGI horror flicks that have been released more recently. This movie holds up to anything recent in the genre, and will probably continue to do so for quite some time.Russell does a great job (as he always does, regardless of the Grizzly Adams impression in this one), Keith David (I'm a big fan of his voice work) is outstanding...Wilford Brimley was a bit of an odd choice for this flick, even though he does do a good job. You think of the Quaker Oats / Diabetes Test Equipment guy playing that sort of role...it's a bit of a head-scratcher.My point, I guess, is this: I've seen this movie many, many times, and it still holds my attention. No sexual tension, no political intrigue...just a bunch of guys playing with flame throwers and bad-tempered aliens. And the ending is phenomenal!!!!!! The only reason I didn't give it a higher score is because there are obviously many movies out there that ARE perfect 10s, such as: Hitchcock's Rebecca, the LOTR trilogy, American History X and the Shawshank Redemption. But John Carpenter's the Thing is definitely high on my horror list! Though it isn't my perfect 10, I still give it 2 thumbs up from my thumb and my other thumb. There you have it. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The pinnacle...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The critical response to THE THING was par for the course: having been brainwashed by kiddie corn like E.T., they could hardly be expected to view objectively what has turned out to be a timeless masterpiece. From an opening evocative of any of a number of 50's sci-fi schlockers (not to mention the closing moments of Carpenter's DARK STAR, itself) to an ambiguous though not unsatisfying ending, it's clear that this masterfully macabre monsterpiece is a bona fide tour de force- a coup de grace, par excellence.The 50's version, which plays out more like the James Whale FRANKENSTEIN, pales by comparison. Carpenter is a meticulous craftsman (he has contemporaries, but no peer) and, for those of us who like our flights of fancy tempered with a bit of storytelling, he does not disappoint: by simply returning to the source material and notching up the suspense in his patented manner, he and scenarist Bill Lancaster have fashioned a claustrophobic chiller that plays the e-t incognito exactly the way it should've been played the first time around. The players, to a man, are excellent. Carpenter's overriding concern is clearly this band of enjoyably eccentric misfits and their reactions to the malevolent monster in their midst. He navigates the tight rope between fantasy and reality like an expert. (Which he is: this is his frightening forte.) The "thing" itself is truly the stuff of which nightmares are made: the movie showcases, without catering to, some marvelous mechanical makeup effects by master monster maker Rob Bottin. Under Carpenter's artistic aegis, these effects are utilized as dramatically as possible. If there's another candidate in the running for greatest monster movie of all time, I haven't seen it. Nothing else comes close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-rated creature feature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definitely over-rated by my reckoning, then again, I'm not a big fan of creature features. They tend to age badly as time goes by because of technological improvements, what may look state-of-the-art at that time becomes prosaic in time to come.As with all the other films in its ilk, the creature is the main focal point with no character development for the human co-stars at all. As a result, one cannot identify with any of the characters. In fact, I found some of the scenes extremely hilarious and burst out laughing, for example, I cracked up during the blood-testing scene when the creature was outed and the body it possessed started to transmogrify into the alien itself, the other humans tied with it were frantically trying to free themselves and the flame throwers were malfunctioning, a scene that could have taken place in a Charlie Chaplin/Marx Brothers feature were it not for the alien.Somehow, I felt that the film could have developed and exploited the paranoia/distrust theme much more to build up the suspense and unpredictability.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacks the creepiness of the 1951 version but nevertheless it's a fantastic visual ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The staff of an Antarctic research post discover that an extraterrestrial is around that can replicate any living thing. It's powers are extraordinary and the staff find themselves in a fight for survival.This remake of the classic Howard Hawks film `The Thing From Another World' takes the guts of that story - improves some things but loses others. Obviously the film greatly improves the special effects and frights provided by James Arness in 1951, however it does so at the loss of some of the suspense of the original. This still has a great feeling of paranoia about it that filters through everything. The story is basic but it has plenty of chills at the start, but once the effects start we see everything and it's more gross than chilling.That's not to say the effects aren't good. They still look good now - despite being 20 years old! It's telling of how much work went into this to reflect that effects wizard Rob Bottin was checked into hospital with exhaustion once the movie was finished.The cast are all pretty good. Russell is a good lead, although this is more of an ensemble piece than a star vehicle. The cast are gradually whittled down until they reach the ending that is not only downbeat but subtle and intelligent. It's flawed if you think about it too much but it works really well after so much gore.Overall it'll never have the classic status of the original but it is definitely a good example of a modern sci-fi that is almost as good as Alien in terms of atmosphere and thrills.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good action, but no emotion or character development.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's start with the good: The special effects are fantastic, the actors are good (despite what they have to work with) and the over all setting is good.So why do I dislike it so much? First of all, the characters have very little personality. Besides their work and their mood, there isn't much to define them by. Bennings and Garry are supposed to have been friends for ten years, but you wouldn't ever have guessed so since you never hear about them actually having known each other that long until Garry says so. When somebody dies, nobody seems bothered. Garry is the only one making a halfhearted attempt to not make Macready burn Bennings body... only to join in and watch Bennings burn. When I first saw the movie, I was confused as to why nobody suspected Garry be a monster... who would be so casual about their best friend for ten years dying? After Bennings is burned, Garry never mentions him again as if they never met. It's also kinda ironic that Macready is the one calling Bennings "George", but Garry never does.And the characters are so unbelievably stupid. Of course there is always somebody ending up alone or walking off alone, making them at risk to be contaminated. And in the end, they have figured out the only one who could possibly be contaminated is Blair. They have figured out flamethrowers will kill the monsters in just a few second. They have figured out that staying together is the best option. So what do they do? They split up to look for Blair and they blow up the whole base with dynamite! So of course someone dies because they walked alone, but then they realize they will freeze to death because they blew up the whole base. Which they didn't need to since Blair was underground! Who thought that was a good idea? Of course they never actually show a scene where they agree it is a good idea..Overall, if you can look past the glaringly obvious stupidity of the movie (everybody keeps walking off alone all the time despite knowing they can get contaminated), the lack of character development (if any), then you got an action-packed movie with an eerie setting and some of the best special effects of its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Commendable science fiction which works well until you place it under close scrutiny - whereupon the faults become all too clear.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the famous short story Who Goes There? (which was previously filmed as The Thing From Another World), this 1982 version of The Thing is an exciting and fairly gruesome slice of science fiction. It has its fair share of shortcomings, which I will mention later, but on the whole this is a commendable film. A bunch of US researchers at a secluded Antarctic base rescue a stray dog. Little do they realise that the dog's body has been inhabited by a deadly alien organism which can take the shape of its victims so that no-one knows it is there. Seems that some Norweigan scientists at a nearby base unearthed the murderous extra terrestrial from the ice, where it had laid frozen for hundreds of thousands of years. Pretty soon, the guys in the American research team are being infected by "The Thing" one by one.... but how can they tell who is who when it can imitate any one of them with such accuracy? The Antarctic setting complements the suspense perfectly. The isolation of a scientific station in the middle of nowhere is an ideal metaphor for the fearful isolation that each character experiences, miles from help and surrounded by other characters who may or may not be what they seem. Rob Bottin's make-up effects and Albert Whitlock's visual effects are memorably (and intentionally) unpleasant. And some performances, notably Kurt Russell as the suicidal hero, are absolutely spot-on. As I touched upon earlier, the film has a few shortcomings. There is never a satisfactory explanation as to how the alien actually infects its victims, and some moments near the end seem illogical (e.g. what's going on with A. Wilford Brimley's character in his last scene, and why does Keith David go running around alone knowing that the alien is on the prowl?) Also there are clumsy goofs - for instance, it is widely-known that Antarctica experiences six months of uninterrupted daylight and six months of uninterrupted darkness, so how come day and night occur on a daily basis in this film? The film is best enjoyed as an exercise in suspense and a show-stopping display of innovative special effects, but if you start to unpick the plot in closer detail the holes begin to show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mess and a travesty of the 1951 classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a good reason why the 1951 The Thing is a classic. Howard Hawks influence is obvious and it packs the excitement, bravado and camaraderie that he brought to his westerns. It introduces us to a variety of characters that are amiable and sympathetic, and balances that with the conflict that erupts between the scientists and military in dealing with the alien threat that confronts them.Looking for anything of similar depth or entertainment value in John Carpenter's woebegone remake is pointless because it simply does not exist. This film adheres a bit more closely to the source novella by John W. Campbell Jr. Carpenter's version adopts an Invasion of the Body Snatchers mentality, wherein a creature "infects" others and takes on their appearances to move about at will. It is an interesting concept, but it becomes apparent that the sole interest Carpenter has is in crafting progressively gorier and grotesque effects to gross-out the viewer.The film keeps the same setting in Antarctica and opens with some Norwegians attempting to kill a sled dog. The chase intersects with a group of Americans at a neighboring research facility, who think the Norwegians are crazy. When the dog is sheltered in the American facility, it is revealed to be The Thing of the title. The remainder of the film is basically a guessing game as to who is really human and who has become an assimilation of The Thing.The storyline sounds infinitely more exciting than it plays out. Carpenter has little to no interest in the characters populating his thriller. There are no women at the base and the men have little to no discernible personalities. There is not a role that is not filled by a capable actor, but no one manages to make much of an impression. Even lead Kurt Russell - doing another one of his lamentable John Wayne imitations - just blends into the bland background of bottled testosterone. Unlike Invasion of the Body Snatchers, where it seemed a distinct tragedy that the central characters were being turned into cold, unfeeling beings, the characters in this film are already relatively emotionless and so we feel no tragedy over their assimilation.It is easy to understand why Carpenter has no interest in plot, character development, or even building genuine suspense, his attention is too focused on the next special effects/make-up freak show extravaganza. All of the imagination seems to have been funneled into the next gore scene. The initial scene where The Thing departs its guise of the sled dog and launches an attack on the other dogs in the kennel is revolting on more levels than one can care to count. The dog's head splits open and the tentacled creature goes on a bloody rampage assimilating animals all around into a giant writhing wall of quivering flesh and fur that splits open in various spots to reveal writhing bloody innards. Animal lovers be forewarned. Full disclosure, when I initially attempted to watch this film (and being a fan of the 1951 original) I actually walked out of the theater shortly after this sequence. Several years later, I decided to give the film another chance and made it all the way through to the end.Later sequences are just as repellent. Body parts fly to and fro, chests are crushed, arms are bitten off, limbs take on lives of their own and try to skitter away. Again, lots of imagination, but it would have been far more impressive if Carpenter had channeled this initiative into more substantial areas of his epic. At the time, this depiction was a bit of a surprise coming from Carpenter, whose thrillers had heretofore largely eschewed graphic violence. Here, he makes up for it a hundred fold.Gradually the men are wittled away. Unfortunately, no one cares. There is no sense of urgency or concern for any of these people. They are all unknowable ciphers and easily interchangeable. We truly cannot tell who The Thing has infected less because of its diabolical nature than because the men are all written and played as colorless cookie-cutter tough guys from the average grade-C action film. Carpenter seems to have no idea how people would genuinely act in such a tense situation and there is no camaraderie amongst the men at all. None of them seem to be friends or work well together - they are a gaggle of lone wolf Marlboro Men braving the great unknown. Despite being isolated together and living in close quarters for months, none of them seem to know even the most minor of things about each other.The vague, ambiguous ending with two of the characters resting amongst the carnage, sharing a drink and trying to ascertain if the other one is human or The Thing is exceptionally vacuous. For one thing, knowing that The Thing propagates itself through body fluids, why in the world would the two men chance sharing a drink from the same bottle? Then again, do we really care about either of these guys? The answer would be a resounding no.Interestingly, the film has developed a cult following and fanatics talk about it like it is some sort of a classic. Unfortunately, nothing could have been further from the truth. At the time of release the film was a major box office disappointment and the majority of critical reviews were scathing. In fact, the only people who really seem to consider this some lost classic are gore hounds who think bloodletting should trump storytelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If You Liked 'Alien,' You'll Like This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This intense sci-fi film is almost horror in nature, a la "Alien" as it features a tremendous amount of suspense. If you liked "Alien," you'll like this, the main difference of the two films being the different setting and a different cast.The cast may be different but the characters are the same: scientists-heroes who are all profane low-life-types who you would never see in professions and positions like this. Only in the world of film do you see sleazy people like this in high-tech intelligent positions such as astronauts or scientists. Who better to exemplify this in the 1980s than self-proclaimed macho man Kurt Russell?Back to the positives: besides the great suspense, the story is an involving one that hooks you in fairly early and never lets go. I have a widescreen VHS copy which looks nice, too, since the visuals definitely warranted a widescreen viewing experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carpenter's Best Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Trust is a tough thing to come by these days." The centre-piece of this feature is the bleak, isolated Antarctic landscape in which the story is set, which Carpenter contrasts so effectively from the outset with the claustrophobic confines of the American research base. The latter was built from scratch at the edge of a glacier in Stewart, British Columbia, with the remoteness of the location shoot exemplified by the cast and crew's hair- raising tales of being transported there. Based on John W Campbell's 1938 story 'Who Goes There?', this adaptation is much more faithful to the source material than Howard Hawks' 1951 original version, 'The Thing From Another World'. Thus, it is ironic that much of the criticism levelled at this production when it was released at the box-office was in lambasting Carpenter for creating such a dark and violent vision in comparison to Hawks' treasured original treatment. In fact, Carpenter not only paid homage to Hawks' original in his version, but also in his earlier body of work. In his 1978 breakthrough, it is playing on the TV set where Jamie Lee Curtis is babysitting, while in this feature the video footage the American team watch to learn what their Norwegian counterparts have unearthed consists of clips from Hawks' version. Carpenter's version's poor critical reception was largely based on its gory special effects, with Roger Ebert dismissing it as a 'barf-bag movie', while Hawks' 1951 director, Christian Nyby, wounded Carpenter by caustically commenting: 'If you want blood, go to the slaughterhouse'. It is clear that by wishing to preserve the shape-shifting alien presence of the source material, and thereby avoid the 'man in a costume' horror of his childhood, Carpenter irrevocably tied his film's fortunes to the quality and reception of its special effects. A second upshot of this decision was in handing total creative licence to special makeup effects creator, Rob Bottin. Having cut his teeth the year previously on 'The Howling', this former apprentice to Rick Baker both thrilled and appalled audiences in equal measure with his nightmarish visions. Though a little dated today, these still retain the power to shock, and deserved at least an Academy Award nomination. In spite of Bottin's laudable workmanship, what they did earn at the time was both a notoriety which deflected attention away from the film's strengths, as well as a period of hospitalisation for Bottin out of pure exhaustion. A further critique aimed at this production was a lack of sufficient characterisation, though it could be argued that with a plot so driven by suspicion, the audience's lack of in-depth knowledge of individual characters adds further to the tension. It is clear that the screenplay, penned by the son of Burt Lancaster whose only other screen writing credit was for the light comedies of the 'Bad News Bears' franchise, is as much of a psychological thriller as it is a visceral horror story. As Carpenter himself later commented: 'The paranoia is the glue that holds the movie together'. This is gradually racked up by the director before reaching its apogee in the film's most acclaimed blood-test scene. It is also supported by Ennio Morricone's throbbing baseline soundtrack, which was so unfairly nominated for a 'Razzie'. Many have questioned the plausibility of the actions of the men trapped on the base with this shape-shifting presence, forgetting that the latter's arrival sharpens the level of mistrust and friction which had been building throughout the team's isolation from the wider world. As such, the alien interloper in its desire to survive at all costs is able to exploit the breakdown of discipline as the team's fragile relationship is tested to its limits under siege. The cast give commendable performances in capturing the escalating tension and dread, none more so than Keith David as the volatile 'Childs' whose belligerence surfaces towards Kurt Russell's hirsute, cynical, renegade helicopter pilot as they bid to take control of the beleaguered survivors. It is fitting that these two characters are the only ones left to await the dying of the flames of their razed base uncertain as to whether their enmity is purely on human terms or one biological organism against another. This is another perfect vehicle provided by Carpenter for Russell's ability to deliver an understated but memorable performance in a role turned down by both Nick Nolte and Jeff Bridges. Russell also contributed the final lines of dialogue: 'Why don't we just...wait here a little while...see what happens?' Although now regarded as a cult movie which raised the bar for the horror genre, this production 's failure at the box office marked the last time Carpenter would be entrusted with a major studio, big-budget vehicle, and the virtual end of Lancaster's career, as both were removed from plans to have them bring Stephen King's 'Firestarter' to the big screen. A victim of the timing of its release to audiences warmed to a much more benign vision of alien visitation in blockbuster, 'E.T.', Carpenter's feature has finally accrued the plaudits it deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the scariest movies from the 80's. The 1951 original version is underrated. That is real one of the very few movies that is scarier then this one. The prequel which should have been called The Thing 2 but instead they called The Thing. That movie is underrated. It is also one of the very few movie that is scarier then this one. Still this is a very good movie. It has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. See all the Thing movies. They are all great movie. This is a very scarier movie. It is a science fiction horror classic. All the Thing movies are great movie. Great movie great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great story (loosely based on novel "Who Goes There?"), suspense (it will give you constant chills and goosebumps), cinematography, practical SFX!!! (created by Roy Arbogast) and climatic music thanks to another master: Ennio Morricone. Very good cast (one of the best roll of Kurt Russell and Keith David - not only in my opinion, check on YouTube top 10 lists for example on WatchMojo.com) If you want to watch good horror you should definitely pick this one (do not consider remake/prequel from 2011) It's in my opinion The Best movie of John Carpenter (he also stated that "The Thing" is his favorite one) During watching you will gonna constantly guessing and feel trapped (just as one of tag-lines says: Man is The Warmest Place to Hide) Even now (2015-2016 and It was released in 1982 that is 34 years ago - it seems like in different historical era) it still holding strong (It's practical SFX are much better than most CGI used in todays horror movies) I love it - it's on my top list. In summary: Timless Horror Masterpeace!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly mind-harrowing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carpenter is an outstanding horror-suspense director, but he simply outdid himself with "The Thing," crafting a horror film rarely touched by any other in intelligence or quality of the ensemble cast. The film truly captures the horror of Campbell's short story, light years ahead of the 50s version, while maintaining the same fearsome idea: that there could be things out there that will take us over, absorb us, and we would not even really know. It's a hysteria that drove many 50s science fiction flicks, but by the 1980s it could be reduced to its pure essence, without that heavy-handed "US vs. the Soviets" thing.When I saw this in the theater in 1982, I felt queasy several times during the film. Yes, as in "about to throw up." It was the uncanny realism of the special effects. It has been remarked that The Thing, and the special effects that embody it, are truly a living character in this film, and it is true. Rob Bottin, Stan Winston, Bill Sturgeon, and the makeup/creature crew did things that could never be done as realistically with CGI effect. And director Carpenter uncompromisingly selected only the best of it for the final cut, as anyone who has seen the "deleted scenes" can attest. Gone are any stop-motion animation or slightly imperfect scenes. The artistic triumvirate and its perfectionist director created the ultimate thing.The ensemble cast of characters, trapped in an Antarctic science station where a creature that absorbs all life forms in their own image gets them one by one, is amazingly good. Yes, Kurt Russell gets first billing and survives to the last, but every character, down to the Norwegian rifleman who tries to warn the Americans of their impending doom when a seemingly harmless husky trots their way, is perfectly cast and plays his perfect role in the grand scheme of things.The film scares, amuses, excites, spellbinds, disgusts, simply everything you could ask of a horror film. Every time I see it, I like it better despite knowing how every character will end, and how the web of dread, hopelessness and helplessness is cast to the bitter end by The Thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece Of Unrelenting Terror, Nail-Biting Suspense &amp; Omnipresent Paranoia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A masterpiece of unrelenting terror, nail-biting suspense &amp; persistently looming paranoia, John Carpenter's The Thing is one of the greatest films of its genre(s) that presents its esteemed filmmaker at the apex of his talents for the remarkable simplicity with which Carpenter succeeds in infusing the storyline with a chilling sense of dread, tension &amp; uncertainty right from its opening moments and then effortlessly sustaining those vital horror elements throughout the film's runtime is no mere achievement in itself.Set in Antarctica, the story of The Thing follows the crew of an American research facility whose expedition is interrupted when a couple of seemingly delusional Norwegians barge into their station while pursuing &amp; shooting a dog, and are killed in defence. But when the dog mutates and reveals its true identity, the crew deduces that they are being confronted by a parasitic alien lifeform that assimilates other organisms and in turn imitates them perfectly. With no one really sure of who's human &amp; who's the imitator among them, paranoia develops within the group.Directed by John Carpenter (the mastermind behind Assault on Precinct 13 &amp; Halloween), The Thing is without a doubt my favourite film of his. The plot creates an atmosphere of impending doom right from the beginning as we can sense that something is definitely not right with the dog, and thanks to the minimal but menacing track that accompanies that sequence, the build-up is quick &amp; effective. Bill Lancaster's screenplay deserves a mention too for it retains the mystery from start to finish, keeps the premise unpredictable &amp; although the characters aren't fleshed out that well, they do have an identity.The technical aspects further help in setting the film's desired tone &amp; atmosphere, starting with its isolated set pieces that have this sort of a raw, unrefined feel to it which, in addition to its remote location, cleverly brings the element of claustrophobia into the narrative. Cinematography makes excellent use of its camera for the wisely chosen angles, minimal lighting &amp; slow but fluid movements encapsulate the whole picture with an unsettling vibe which only amplifies as the story progresses. Editing is carried out in a very methodical manner as it allows the suspense to settle in at its own pace and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats throughout its 109 minutes of runtime.The work in the special effects &amp; make-up department might have been groundbreaking during its time of release but it looks a tad dated now and at times, unintentionally funny as well and yet it fits &amp; work in favour of this narrative for the most part. However, the most impressive aspect of The Thing in my opinion is its background score, composed by Ennio Morricone. What's amazing about the soundtrack is that it sounds exactly the way Carpenter himself would've scored it, with simple, synthesised tracks that help enhance the sinister mood of the picture and elevate it to a nerve-wracking level. It's quite possibly the best John Carpenter score that wasn't composed by John Carpenter.Coming to the performances, Kurt Russell spearheads the rest of the cast with a good show and plays the role of the research team's helicopter pilot. The script doesn't delve into the background of its various characters but it does give each one of these scripted people their deserving moment on the screen. There is much similarity to Ridley Scott's Alien as far as its casting goes for each character has a role to play here and even if we don't get to know enough about any of them, their predicament and the situation they find themselves in on the isolated continent is deeply felt. Also, both Russell &amp; the rest of the supporting cast do well with what they're given and deliver truly convincing performances.On an overall scale, The Thing is as suspenseful as any cinema can get. It deserves to be ranked amongst the greatest horror films ever made, has aged amazingly well over the years despite its dated effects and still remains John Carpenter's finest directional effort to date. It may not be scary on a visceral level but its tense ambiance, claustrophobic setting &amp; the omnipresent danger of the unknown can run havoc on the senses plus it leaves enough pieces for viewers to put together once the whole story has concluded. Immortal for its contribution to cinema, absolutely living up to its legacy, and continuing to inspire &amp; influence modern chillers, John Carpenter's magnum opus is one chiller no horror fanatic should miss out on. Strongly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thing is a splendid presentation of horror at its best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter has always been a director of many talents, bringing forth some of the most creative and scary films ever to grace the screen, like Halloween, In The Mouth Of Madness, The Fog, and Christine. But he broke the mold when he made The Thing, and the result is probably the greatest monster movie in history. Sure Jaws was great, and so was Alien, but The Thing blows them all away. It's about a twelve-man research team that unwittingly takes in an alien organism that has been frozen in the ice for over 100,000 years. As if things couldn't be worse, this alien can shape-shift and "absorbs" its victims, so no one in the camp quite knows who is real and who is "the thing." Rob Bottin's special effects for the film are probably its ground-breaking achievement, for it was the first movie with a really gross-looking monster, and the monster effects still look great even today. Ennio Morricone's chilling score, Dean Cundey's beautiful photography, and John Llyod's incredible sets all help contribute to the eerie mood of the picture. Not only that, but the cast does a great job, and as far as I'm concerned, Carpenter was at the peak of his skills when he made this film. It was rather disappointing to find out that it didn't do that well at the box office, but at least it can have a nice long afterlife on DVD market now. So, I don't know what else I can say except run out and buy this wonderful film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quickie Review: The Thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dumb-Dumb? Dumb-Dumb? Dumb-Dumb...so goes the now chilling theme (which was originally nominated for a Razzie, you know) which, though it sounds like classic Carpenter, was actually composed by the legendary Ennio MorrIone. It perfectly captures the sense of dread and foreboding that The Thing emits. I remember when I first watched this on TV years ago. I didn't know who John Carpenter was or Kurt Russell or Ennio Morricone. All I saw was the title, and it was intriguing enough for me to go in blind. And what an experience it was. Paranoiac, gut- wrenching and filled with outstanding special effects, The Thing left me with my mouth open long after the credits started rolling. Set in the isolated Antarctica and filled to the brim with a memorable supporting cast, each of whom threaten to steal the scene they're in, The Thing is far more than an "Ooh. Ahh!" splatter fest. Though the creature effects (completely practical ? take that, CGI!) have gone down in history as some of the most inventive and disgusting in cinema, the paranoia and mistrust between the characters is just as nail-biting to watch. The all-male group of actors are constantly at each other's throats, prioritising their own survival, and anyone could be 'the thing.' The creature is t it's most powerful when the humans are doing the killing and fighting for it. There is a constant sense of dread, as previously stated, of what is to come, of who to trust, that when one of 'the things' is revealed an orgasmic amount of colours hit the screen - there is blood and body parts flying in all directions. It's an excellent film that is essentially a collection of memorable scenes. Take the blood test scene ? the protagonist, played by Russell, ties up the rest of the cast and takes a sample of their blood in a petri dish to burn and, hopefully, reveal who is not human in the group. There is arguing as Russell moves from one dish to the next, and Carpenter cleverly distracts us with the dialogue ? we become do engrossed into what the characters are accusing each other of that when the alien blood 'jumps' out of the dish it feels as though someone has stamped on your heart. Then the character who was the thing transforms, and our nail-biting is rudely interrupted by a terrifically tense showdown between Kurt Russell and the thing (the others are, of course tied up). After the hullabaloo is over, tensions rise again, but not quite as much, as Russell's continues with his tests, untying those who have been had their blood tested. It ends with the final character, exasperated after having been finally cleared, bellowing a hilarious line at the rest of the cast, after which we fade to black and are given the chance to breath. It's masterful direction. The Thing is, quite simply, one of the all-time great horror/sci-fi films and undoubtedly John Carpenter's best work. Best Scene: There are so many to choose from, from the nail-biting blood test scene to the cringe-worthy deliberator scene. But like with most of Carpenter's work, I'm going to go with the ending. It's a cliff-hanger that is just so brilliant on so many levels that you really have to watch the film to appreciate. So if you haven't seen The Thing, be sure to add it to your watch list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the creepiest thing I have ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the more horrific alien-themed films I have seen, a story where a team of scientists in Antarctica faces an alien who changes into the shape of living things it infects.This movie's plot is straight to-the-point with no fillers, however, the pacing is a bit slow due to the lack of character emotions and development. But, the horrifying appearances of the hideous-looking alien thing and its attack on the hapless humans make the film tense and intriguing at times. The plot element of the scientists attempting to destroy any traces of the alien before it spreads its infectious toxin to the rest of the world is an exciting one.Aside from the alien plot, much of the film has a gloomy atmosphere setting and uninteresting, bland-acting, characters that didn't carry the movie much and rendered it boring at times. The special effects were good, but the overall visual of the film was dark and dull. Overall, it was an average film for me.Grade C</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thing is Other to, at the very least, mammalian life-forms on Earth. They have been frozen away in the depths for the last 100,000 years at least and now that they are out they are trying to figure out their place on an unknown world. If they had crash-landed further north how would the evolution of our planet been different?For more of this kind of perspective you should do a search for the Clarkesworld short story by Peter Watts that moves through the storyline from the perspective of The Thing.Aside from human speculation about alien thought the film is certainly a classic in the sci-fi horror genre. It has similarities to Alien in both plot-line and special effects. The thing the movie lacks is a sense of humor. I like that in a good horror flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrific surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When my boyfriend and I decided to watch this movie, we dove into it thinking it was going to be a rather amusing, easygoing piece of classic 80's horror movie with clichs and bad effects. And that is was similar to Alien. That's all we knew and we didn't expect much. So the movie started and we giggled at the cheesy characters and bad haircuts (Kurt Russell, as always, is a gem), as you do. Then along came the scene where the dog mutated and we both fell silent in awe. Occasionally, one of us burst out saying "WOW". I could not have been more surprised or terrified.If you are a fan of over-the-top 80's gore effects, seen in e.g. Cronenberg movies or the Evil Dead trilogy, you are going to love The Thing. This movie went to such an extreme level of gory mutation and body horror that I can only really compare to the ending of The Fly. Yet, even if the extent to which the body horror is taken is some of the most extreme and in turn ridiculous I've seen in any movie of this kind so far, The Thing never loses its finesse. As horrific and disgusting as they are, you still always look forward to the next mutation scene, just to see what new thing they can think of next. The Thing is one of the absolutely most creative horror films I have ever seen.But The Thing was much more than just the gore. In this movie, John Carpenter once again proves he is the master of build-up. The tension, partially thanks to the skillful camera-work, never stop creeping under your skin throughout the story and never lets you stop keeping guessing. The characters themselves are unable to trust each other, and for the viewer, it never gets less obvious who you can trust or not. It manages to always keep you on the edge of your seat.The Thing only really falls short in the boring soundtrack and the flat characters with little to no personality, except for Kurt Russell, whose character is unnecessarily crass and hard to relate to as the hero of the story. But with that said, it's hard to believe the hatred the movie first got upon release (Roger Ebert, I'm looking at you!). The Thing is surprisingly enjoyable, especially for its genre, it really stands out.</fullReview>

If you've seen as many different kinds of parasites as I have; and, the sickening damage that they can do as long as I've been a Veterinary Technician...you'd feel exactly the same way.AND..with all of these new and mutated seemingly-medicine-resistant strains of parasites; diseases; viruses; and, other sicknesses nowadays...movies like this; and, "I Am Legend"(rabies); "Night of the Living Dead"(radio activity); "The Hidden"(Leucochloridium paradoxum - an hypnotic parasite that controls and makes a snail become a victim - makes a snails eyes/tentacles appear to be maggots and has the snail slide into broad-daylight so birds will eat them, hence, completing their parasitic life-cycle); "The Walking Dead"(like cancer - everyone carries it and it only has to be activated); "Alien"(a 'creature' has developed a way to 'impregnate' other creatures with its spawn, like a parasite)...and, the list goes on and on.Of course, this movie would be even more horrific if it were real...and, that may not be far away!?!?If you love horror movies as I do; love to be frightened; and, love a great movie with a great story, great stars, and, great direction; and, all set in a cold and barren place with little chance of escape - this movie is exactly what you're looking for! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Old Fashioned Tension.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's The Thing is a great film.It's hard at times to put a finger on what makes it so great but to me it is the use of tension. The narrative of The Thing thrives on the growing paranoia and distrust between the characters as the story progresses. Even as just a science fiction/horror film the story is intriguing but then you mix in the tension and it gives the characters a much more genuine feel. Every character feels essential and the decaying sense of camaraderie is almost sad to watch.Overall, if for some reason you are looking at this page and haven't seen this movie before you should watch it now. If the plot synopsis sounds even remotely interesting to you then just watch it. It's awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Total remake of an old horror/sci-fi film using an age old idea/fear of an alien creature infiltrating a human base and then humans themselves...its suppose to make your skin crawl.A bit of a failure at the box office upon release but this was mainly down to the tough competition of 'Blade Runner' and the friendly alien 'E.T.'. Despite that the film came into its own once hitting the video market and became something of a cult.Personally I think its a good solid film but its never appealed greatly due to its shape shifting alien that is simply surreal to the extreme. Of course the effects are the main showcase of the film and back in 82 they were pretty special, by today's standards on a recent viewing they have aged badly and do look (of course) rather plastic and fake BUT they do still hold up as, unlike CGI, they are actually real.The imagination of Bottin is clearly let loose big time for the alien as he goes way off the wall coming up with all manner of combinations aimed at making you feel uneasy, and it does work. Utilizing spider forms, snake/eel forms, things growing or under the skin, being violated and having something germinate within you etc...all good stuff to make you squirm. The suspense and bleakness is handled well by a young Carpenter (much like 'The Fog') and examines how quickly people break down and turn on each other. All the set work is cruel and cold looking, good location work and with nice elements of 'Alien' used throughout including the isolated oddball crew at the base which does remind you of the Nostromo crew.Its definitely a thriller of a ride with some stand out moments which leave you wanting to know more about the creature and its background. The film just loses its wallop near the end as the creature doesn't look quite as cool as previous incarnations, edging down the B-movie route a touch but the one thing I do like about the film is the way Carpenter bookended it. Its pretty much open at both the start and finish leaving you to think about what came before and what happens after, the final sequence with Russell and David is quite original and unique as the heroes/main leads pretty much fail.Best moment in the film for me has to be the Norris chest bursting sequence revealing a large razor toothed maw where his torso once was, highly original and, at the time, quite surprising.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter's "The Thing" is a rarity among movies. It's a remake of a classic ("The Thing From Another World") that managed to eclipse the original. It did so by hewing closer to the source material (John W. Campbell's classic novella "Who Goes There?") and by showcasing some incredible visual effects.The story concerns a group of American scientists stationed in the Antarctic. In the film's opening, they encounter a group of seemingly mad Norwegians frantically pursuing a dog in an attempt to kill it. Unbeknownst to the Americans, the dog is actually an alien that assumes the shape of its victims. When the Norwegians are killed, the dog is taken in by the Americans and begins to turn them against one another.The plot is rife with paranoia as tensions arise over who may or may not be an alien in disguise. The story is as bleak as the Antarctic wasteland that provides its background but is enlivened by the extraordinary special effects of Rob Bottin (and, in one sequence, Stan Winston). Admittedly, not all of the effects have aged equally well but there are several memorable sequences scattered throughout the film.Meanwhile, John Carpenter's direction shows a deft control of building suspense, maintaining it and, ultimately, paying it off with unexpected scares. Another vital element in the film's atmosphere is the icily foreboding score by Ennio Morricone.In terms of acting, though, I find the movie to be fairly undistinguished. Kurt Russell's OK in the lead role but I find that he's better suited to lighter material (eg. "Big Trouble in Little China"). The supporting cast includes a few recognizable individuals like Wilford Brimley and Keith David but, for the most part, the ensemble's composed of relative unknowns who perform their roles satisfactorily though unexceptionally.Taken altogether, "The Thing" is a well-executed horror/sci-fi movie that's deserving of its cult status. The special effects may be the main attraction but the story is equally important in the scheme of things. John Carpenter and company undoubtedly delivered a movie that was worthy of its landmark predecessor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>-The Thing follows a team of scientists who find a strange being frozen at an Arctic base. When the alien escapes, it begins to take the forms of the team members, causing terror and suspicion throughout the Arctic.-I love The Thing for any reasons, but really because of its ability to merge realistic characters, a tense story and plot that leaves you captivated, terrified without using jumpscares, and leaves you guessing until the end?. And beyond! (evil laugh) -It stars Kurt Russell and a few others who all do a great job. One of my all-time favorite performances from him, as well as one of the best horror-movie heroes.-The music is very eerie and haunting, but it's not that great to be honest. It feels old, but it's not really about the music.-I guess I should go ahead and talk about the visuals. They are pretty visually terrifying. It is 100% practical effects with no CG, which makes it even more gross, but it is also old now, so it's not really that scary at a few moments. Still, best practical effects I have ever seen. That and Jurassic Park.-It is rated-R because of its visuals. It also had a few F-words, but that's like 4. Not too bad, unless you hate creepy aliens morphing out of people. I think it's sweet! -So John Carpenter's classic version of The Thing delivers in acting, suspense, story, and scare factor that is so much better than clich. I will say that The Thing is totally worth seeing! (If you like horror/sci-fi films) I gave it a high 8.5/10 as my #37 of all time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scientists in the Antarctic are confronted by a shape-shifting alien that assumes the appearance of the people that it kills. An American scientific expedition to the frozen wastes of the Antarctic is interrupted by a group of seemingly mad Norwegians pursuing and shooting a dog. The helicopter pursuing the dog explodes, eventually leaving no explanation for the chase. During the night, the dog mutates and attacks other dogs in the cage and members of the team that investigate. The team soon realizes that an alien life-form with the ability to take over other bodies is on the loose and they don't know who may already have been taken over. The Thing is a horror classic that is genuinely creepy and ultimately effective in its approach. This is one of Carpenters best films, right up there with The Fog and Halloween. All of the actors give strong, realistic performances just as if it were really happening. The Thing is truly a horror classic that any lover of horror will enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the greatest movies of all time, my personal favorite movie in any genre! John Carpenter created a masterpiece that stands as the crown jewel in the horror genre! Great acting, thick atmosphere, brilliant effects, and smart character decisions are just some of the things 'The Thing' offers. Speaking of the characters, this is one of the aspects where the movie stands apart from the rest, they make logical decisions for the greater good of the group. They aren't splitting up, going to into dark rooms alone, they are fighting back and using science to their advantage. Outside of strong characters, the movies special effects are unrivaled even by today's technological advancements and widening resources. The practical effects used in the movie look spectacular, over the top yes, but never too fake to the point where they become silly. The creatures many taking forms could not look any more impressive or scary! This is the standard that all horror movies should be judged, from its foreboding atmosphere, to special effects, and strong characters, this is the crown jewel in the horror department!Full Review at : http://www.simplefilmreviews.com/2014/05/the-thing-1982.html</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Horror Film Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never has there been a more perfect horror film. Carpenter really out-did himself with this one, and has had trouble approaching this greatness ever since.From the story to the characters to the music to the atmosphere to the special effects this is a masterpiece in every way, and the fact that it didn't do too well at the box office proves that Americans are indeed a very fickle audience. There is no logical reason why this should not have been a major box office smash! It's even better than Halloween and a lot better than The Fog. And it's a trillion times better than the lousy CGI horror movies nowadays, including the rubbish remake. I will go as far as to say that Hollywood has "totally" forgotten how to make horror movies (I haven't seen a decent one in, like 20 years).This is right up there with Halloween, The Wicker Man, Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, The Omen and Texas Chainsaw Massacre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One if the great horror films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thing is one of the most suspenseful films ever made. This is a remake that is nothing like the original, and that's alright to me. Instead of the original monster, they made a new one who can morph into creatures that it absorbs. This ads an element of suspense that the original lacks.The movie takes place in Antarctica. The main characters are secluded from other humans, which stops them from being able to escape so easily. The movies starts out slow, but once the monster is introduced, it is one fright after the other. It can be rather gross, because of its great special effects, but that is not what makes it scary. It is so suspenseful not knowing who is the thing, and when you find out, you are shocked and horrified. The blood scene is so suspenseful, and when the blood jumps up, it is just scary. Of course, you can't forget the dog scene. 9/10The ending is perfect. I like how it leaves with a cliffhanger, leaving them out there to freeze to death. Great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thing (1982) is not only the best horror film of all time, it's also the best remake of all time. It still scares me to this day.This movie isn't even cheesy. It's pure horror. Not knowing who's human or who's not, aliens being able to almost perfectly impersonate the host, the constant distrust... It's truly terrifying.The special effects are very good, especially for the 80s. The look of the aliens when they transform doesn't look fake or rubber at all. It's believable effect-wise.The acting is superb and believable. It's not like the acting in Friday The 13th or any of that cheese. It's very good.9/10 would defiantly recommend this wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An interesting combination of top notch Hollywood movie and low-grade B-movie. Segments of considerable suspense, but with the suspense disappointingly released far too easily at the end. Great, convincing special effects but wildly over-used. Fine actors, acting well, but little characterization in the script. Large budget spent on creating a highly believable antarctic environment, but then glaring lapses allowed. For example, one character says something like "Are you crazy? Go out in these 35 knot winds?", and in the next shot, the helicopter is flying through a beautiful clear sunny sky with not a cloud moving. They get out of the chopper and MacReady keeps his hat on easily and not a lock of his flowing mane moves. Or to take another example, as some characters go from one part of the station to another, they cling to a guide rope as if their life depended on it, but there is plenty of light to see by and only signs of a light breeze. Why not just walk calmly to their destination? Very puzzling.It felt like a fine effort, but by a director who had a little difficulty shaking off some of his low budget background.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carpenter is a great director, and this is a great movie. The acting, the cinematography, the timing, everything contributes to make it a masterpiece. Carpenter shows us that he knows how to use closes, wide- views, fast and slow action, all in order to portray the misery and grandeur of men facing danger. But the goo, the gore, the trash, in one word, is absolutely ridiculous. Childish minds will tremble with terror and shrink down in the couch while seeing it, but adult people will just laugh at it. Why not create a "reasonable" monster, with no harm to the story? Or perhaps it wouldn't even be necessary to show it. The knowing that it is present and acting would be horror by itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loving Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carpenter has always been a favorite of mine. He's not afraid to let his imagination run wild, and he's one of the few directors out there capable to put together a movie that is interesting, exciting, scary, and even, as it's the case here, adapt material that a few people consider untouchable and turn it into a populist work of art. "The Thing" is the ultimate scary hybrid, a film that takes the best of so many genres and delivers a superb package that few will ever disagree with the fact that it is almost a perfect film.Based on the old classic, Carpenter has made a grungier and more graphic film, with the exception of a couple of gory scenes, the movie works very well, giving us a closer and more intimidating portrayal of the dangers of facing this monster or space alien. Much, like the feral alien, an evil we dare not face or ever encounter, this "thing" is a formidable creation.As I mentioned before, he borrows a bit from a few directors, to give us style, majestic vistas, exciting and horrific thrills, intense drama, a ton of suspense, and plenty of uncertainty, and that is the soul of the film. First, the science fiction elements which quickly mutate to a cat and mouse chase that evolves into an experiment in paranoia, as the crew finds itself under attack by an enemy that is difficult to conquer, understand, gauge or even locate. Soon, one by one the crew falls prey to their own fears as they don't know who is real and who is a perfect and lethal copy."The Thing" takes us into a wild ride that will give us what we expect in the movies: great acting, great direction, fantastic special effects manufactured by a crew that didn't rely on the sophisticated technology directors can avail themselves of nowadays. The editing hits all the marks as we follow the creature in its indiscriminate chase of the crew.A lot of people were upset with the ending because it doesn't resolve much, but in truth, it allows us to become participants in the adventure because if the creature is still around, we might have to question ourselves about what the next move might be. It might make you resourceful or just another victim.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big let down despite being a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into watching this movie with high expectations as John Carpenter's 'Halloween' is one of my favorite horror movies. I was excited to see this movie- that was for sure The premise to 'The Thing' sounds very interesting with a shape shifting alien who duplicates and shape shifts into humans picking off members of an expedition at Antarctica. I'll tell you why I was interested. Monster horror movies such as Alien are just amazing and so I was excited for this. Being trapped in Antarctica is perhaps the best place to be trapped and John Carpenter's suspense added in Halloween and absolute minimal level of gore made his original Halloween a frightening movie. So, it was hard for me not to have high expectations The acting by the entire cast is very good mainly Kurt Russel who shines as MacReady. The music was great but to me, not as frightening or anywhere near as iconic as the Halloween theme. The story was as I said...just an awesome premise for a horror. The writing and directing were great. The movie falls a bit in terms of suspense as I found the movie very suspense-less and very "not so scary" The effects have certainly been outdated but that isn't a flaw considering the movie came out 30 years ago. I felt that during many circumstances that the suspense level could've easily been risen and would've had me far more interested in the story. There were lots of good stuff such as the ending which like 'Halloween' is an amazing ending.The movie never really frightened me. Some times, I found the characters and the story falling away from me. My expectations should've been too high as I constantly found myself wondering if any real suspense would be built into the movie. Most of the suspense was held back to the last ten minutes or so which was a disappointment I however believe, that this review will not be one that most agree with and it is far more likely that you enjoy it a whole heap more than I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real classic from the king of atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thing is real classic from king of atmosphere, John Carpenter, and one of the most famous horrors which is, nowadays, a lot more easier to classify as a psychological thriller than a horror movie. The film is based on a novel by John W. Campbell, Jr., Who Goes There? and is often mentioned as a remake of The Thing from Another World from 1951. It is also a part of the Apocalypse trilogy which also includes Prince of Darkness (1987) and In the Mouth of Madness (1994). The film begins with a scene of Norwegian scientist chasing a dog in Antarctica. The hunt ends at the U.S. scientific station where Americans, of course, shot fissured Norwegian and saved the dog. They weren't concerned about why someone so badly wanted to kill the dog so they let him stay in the station. Soon we learn the reason of Norwegian pursuit. Norwegian scientists have found unknown being frozen in the ice and being convinced that it's dead they unfrozed it. The thing was alive and just like every other life-form it wanted to survive. Only ability the thing had is to imitate any life-form with which it makes contact. In imitating process original life-form dies. And that is the core of the story. Who's real and who's not? As a psychological thriller film works wonderfully. Horror elements fits perfectly and the atmosphere is brilliantly polished with scenery and music and special effects are pretty impressive for 80's. Many scenes in the film are still striking and recognizable. That's what makes the film special, but pretty much everything else falls under mediocrity. The cast led by Kurt Russell did a solid job, and for many people Russell is most recognizable as MacReady. Here we come to the big problem of characterization. It is not strange for Carpenter that the main characters are superficial and purpose of many of them is only to die. Almost every his story is successful despite this, but that does not diminish the fact that this is still a big problem because the easiest way for audience to connect with film is through the characters. Also, some characters must behave totally illogical for story to be successful, what especially in the modern era, is very annoying. But in total The Thing deserves a high mark. Especially because of the brilliant atmosphere and interest that it creates.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sci-fi horror isn't really my thing but I did enjoy John Carpenter's stylish and exciting re-make of a 1950's Howard Hawks production (which I haven't seen). Sure the plot looks very familiar, Alien gone south, but the freezing climate and remote location of the Antarctic fit the "nowhere to run" scenario just as well as the moon.After the arresting opening, which introduces the vastness of the frozen wasteland of the region as a helicopter for some reason chases a husky dog over miles and miles until it reaches the American scientific exploration base, the film settles into the again familiar "and then there were none" plot line as the alien entity starts to prey on every living thing in the camp.The film benefits, in my opinion from its lack of major star-power, thus providing a more communal feel among the menaced men and making it harder to guess who, if anyone will still be standing at the end. The special make-up effects are absolutely terrific, making for many "don't look now" moments. Carpenter keeps us in the dark, literally, as almost all the attack sequences take place to gloomy backdrops, aided in this by Ennio Morricone's brooding and atmospheric soundtrack. The acting is good, strong ensemble stuff, although some of the characters fir me lacked individuality. I'd also slightly criticise the ending as being inordinately stretched out and lacking the climactic finish I think the previous tension merited.Nevertheless this was at least as gripping and exciting as any of the "Alien" movies I've seen, plus the similarly themed "The Abyss". In fact, make my aliens bloodthirsty rather than cuddly any day of the week.</fullReview>

John Carpenter definitely did a great job on this one. From "Halloween" to this, John Carpenter is a pure genius. One of my most favorite parts in The Thing is when they find the dead Norwegian strapped to the chair frozen, and when they find the open ice chamber where the thing slept for years.The atmosphere in this scene is so dark that I couldn't wait to see the rest of this movie. The most popular parts about The Thing has got to be the Gore. This movie redefines the Horror genre, and easily claims the top of the violence meter. Next to The Exorcist, The Thing is a definite must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably one of the best horror films ever made. A true classic.The film is filled with great moments and incredible effects. Undoubtedly some of the best pre CGI effects ever filmed. The tension the film creates is perfect. The characters are believable and acted well. The story line starts off confusing as a helicopter with a passenger is seen shooting at a dog as it runs away. The dog runs into the camp and is rescued by a group of American scientists. The scientists head over to a nearby Norwegian research station where they discover that it has been abandoned and there are signs of death and destruction throughout. From there the story quickly progresses to one of terror as the scientists are killed off by a mysterious creature that can imitate them.For those of a squeamish nature beware, the mutations in this film are expertly done giving a real feel of authenticity. It is a very bloody film with many violent deaths. But this is a horror film after all and you really get your money's worth here. It doesn't go too over the top like many creature films do. The direction of John Carpenter draws us in and along with it the terror felt by the characters.In 2011, a prequel to this film was released showing what happened to the Norwegian team.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can i say but WOW!What an excellent film.The paranoia created by John Carpenter is outstanding!The special effects created by Rob Bottin are the best ever,ranking at the top with Tom Savini.I've been up to the filming site at Stewart,B.C. and can say they picked the best place for this film.Kurt Russel as MaCready gives an outstanding performance, Keith David as Childs the brooding pot smoking mechanic also gives an excellent performance.The pinnacle of this film though is Rob Bottins special effects.The set design and filming the movie in reverse to use their camp as the Norweign camp worked quite well.The musical score Ennio Merconne.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, Escape From New York, Big Trouble In Little China, Halloween, Halloween 2, The Fog, Escape From LA and Christine all of those movies had John Carpenter and they were all of his movies I've seen and liked excluding this so you might say I am biased towards him as a writer/director. This is considered by many as his best movie so I decided to take a look.The overall plot sounds a little weird but the execution is very well done - On an expedition in Antartica twelve men come across an insane Norwegian who wants to kill a dog that is running towards them - after killing the Norwegian it turns out the dog is really an alien that mutates into the things it kills after killing 4 of the dogs, the people notice it and burn it - after a while they find out it isn't dead yet and discover that it mutates into the things it kills - so it's all a mystery - Who is THE THING!There are a few of those "jump" moments where something unexpected happens on screen that is meant to scare you - it works extremely well in this movie. I think that the mystery element of this adds to the horror as well.Would it surprise you to say I prefer Halloween? It's all opinion but I do think so. Anyway - my opinion is that The Thing is a movie definitely worth being on the Top 250</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Trust has became a scarce commodity, because of the simple fact we never really know a person, because in reality it's impossible to know a person fully, there is just always something to hide.This film is my favorite film from my favorite movie director John Carpenter as well as my favorite horror film and favorite films in general. The film really helped pave the way for the way we look at most horror and suspense films but also was an inspiration for video games like "Dead Space", parts of "Resident Evil". It's also a prime example of a remake when done the right way, don't get me wrong I like the 1950's film it's good in it's own way but I love the 80's version more because of just that being good in it's own way, a way I just like the most.There is so much I really love about this film, I love the creature effects from one of my favorite make up/effect artists Rob Boltin as well as the late great Stan Winston. I liked seeing the dolperganger alien whenever it pops out it just seems to always transform into whatever the heck it's suppose to look like, it just seems to be a mixture of things, their slightly inspired by the monster from H.P. Lovecraft's stories which always had bizarre otherworldly monsters.I love the location it really sets up a atmosphere of fear and isolation. The music from Enccio Morone is excellent, it's one of my favorite horror scores ever, the theme song is memorable it just has that evokes the feeling of cold lonely fear. But most importantly it was in the suspense which is the best thing and a common thing with Carpenter.You are just on red alert throughout the whole film, because the danger doesn't let up even in it's peaceful moments. I actually jumped a few times watching this movie and that was a great feeling that I don't get often. Like that infamous blood test scene, I was at edge having both anticipation on who the Thing is but at the same time scared of the possibility of the Thing. You really feel just that sense of paranoia. From the enviorment which feels palpable, just the cold, darkness, and sheer isolation knowledge that these people are in the middle of nowhere and there is no one out there to help because their miles away. There is also the fact that no one can really run or even hide, because you really can't get out of the facility there is nothing out in that envorment to run to, you'll freeze to death in mere minutes. And due to the Thing being anyone along with how small the facility is it leaves few places to really hide. So it leaves you with that sense of doom and dread because of the lack of those options.It's true these characters don't have much depth and you don't get to really know most of them despite some personality on them but that's the point. Even though these characters all live under the same roof you can see their all not really close, and it just goes to show that just because your in the same enviorment doesn't automatically mean all will be friends, it's like with the high school and collage I've been to there are hundreds or almost thousands of people that I pass by or go to class with and barely know a mere fraction of them.Though a couple of characters stand out for me mainly MacReady and Childs played by two favorite actors of mine Kurt Rusell and Keith David. Both just have some of the best lines and both are proactive in the situation, I like how both are scared but their don't wimp out against danger they fight back, let alone that really is the only option available. Let alone both are likable and easy to emphasize with a bit because both are bored and just want to get the heck out of the facility. I don't blame them, I might just go nuts being there to long without a anime convention or girl around that can really suck.The Thing itself it an enigma, we don't really know it's motives or if it even has any. Nor does it seem to have really a true form since it can replicate itself by being viral. I even like how it behaves which makes it feel all the more real, despite primal it's capable of intelligence it was able to fly and tried to rebuild it's spacecraft after all. It's also kinda like a game hunter, the Thing doesn't really do anything at first but you know it will once it's moment comes, the humans it imitates are practically it's camouflage which is it's edge, and what makes it a hard opponent to nail. Did the Thing come from another planet we haven't discovered or may'be another galaxy. Was the alien suppose to be some kinda scout for invasion of Earth or could it of been some sort of bio weapon some alien race created to help destroy Earth's inhabitants. I don't know your theories are as good as mine, but that makes the creature all the more scary.This film was an acknowledgment of cold war paranoia as well as paranoia of disease in the 80's decade but I also feel it's relevant today with our decade with our war on terrorism and chemical weapons/disease epidemics. The main theme is about distrust of our fellow man, how it is not the enemy seen that will destroy people but it is fear of the stranger that becomes our undoing.It's not the enemy that you see that should be fear, it is the enemy unseen.Rating: 4 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror in the Antarctic Winter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the beginning the viewer knows that there is something alien in the Antarctic as we are shown an alien vessel in the opening scene. The next thing we see is somebody trying to shoot a dog from a helicopter; as the dog reaches an American base it looks as if the people in the helicopter aren't quite sane as the man with the rifle wounds one of the Americans while trying to shoot the dog; realising they are in danger they shot him? and take the dog into their camp. Of course this was a very bad mistake; one which will cost many lives. The dog wasn't actually a dog; it had been taken over entirely by an alien creature at a cellular level; an alien that isn't content to take the form of a mere dog! When the people realise what they are up against paranoia sets in; anybody could be alien and nobody trusts anybody else. Each time they thing of a way to identify or beat the creature it is thwarted and eventually they realise if they are to prevent it getting off Antarctica and infecting everybody on the planet they may all need to die.This is a classic horror where a group of people are trapped in a confined area with no means of communication or escape to the outside world. In the respect it reminded me of the superior 'Alien' although the way the alien here could mimic its victims increased the sense of paranoia. The effects looked pretty good and were delightfully grotesque in a way that could only be achieved with models and make-up rather that the CGI that would inevitable be used today. The cast, led by Kurt Russell did a fine job as did director John Carpenter; they managed to keep the frights coming right till the end and even then there was some ambiguity about the creatures survival!</fullReview>

The movie is the second version to the 1951 original.Now there has been a prequel made to Carpenter's classic.Whether it is a good thing or not, I can not tell until I have seen the movie.But I can tell for certain already, that it can't beat this one.Who would even try?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of those movies that gets better with repeated viewings, and preserves a sense of dread every time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Up until the last ten minutes of its running time, John Carpenter's "The Thing" upholds its contemporary, well-deserved legacy as one of the best of recent science-fiction films. Actually, the picture is more of a mishmash of science-fiction and horror, with a tremendous amount of impact being held up on the part of the second. It is based on the novelette "Who Goes There?" by John W. Campbell, Jr. which was also the source for a much-lauded 1951 Howard Hawks film with a pre-"Gunsmoke" James Arness and, more recently, a prequel to Mr. Carpenter's film. Comparing all three films, I think it is fair to say that Mr. Carpenter's has held up the best: it's the trimmest, the most purely enjoyable, even if it's somewhat unpleasant to watch. Then again, that was the whole idea.It's also the closest to the original story, about a research team in Antarctica composed of a large group of men who find themselves placed under attack by a shape-shifting critter from outer space, which can seamlessly adopt the characteristics of organisms (men included) that it comes into contact with and walk about undetected until it decides to change shape again. The Howard Hawks version had a monster that, as described by Mr. Carpenter, was a "Frankenstein's monster" as opposed to the other-worldly thing in the story, and the 1982 film.It is such a fabulous, smashing idea for a science-fiction film as well as a straight-up gross-out horror flick, which "The Thing" marvelously, not clumsily, combines together. One of the fabulous tactics that the filmmakers make is not giving the alien creature a definable, recognizable shape. We never see what it looked like before it started assimilating dogs, men, and who knows what else from all corners of the universe before and after its crash into the Antarctic ice a hundred thousand years ago. This in turn produces a truly effective sense of dread about the creature, as it can appear in and out of nowhere whenever it chooses to. It adds another dimension to the "Jaws" theory, that the unknown or unseen is more effective.And when we do see the thing, it is done with special effects so tremendous that they actually surpass the digital concoctions in its 2011 prequel. When it changes shape, its disguise starts to spurt blood and protrude with all sorts of strange figures, oftentimes from life forms it attacked before. Whereas Mr. Carpenter kept visual blood to a minimum in his classic 1978 film "Halloween," here he lets it pour in spurts, hoses, and torrents from the disfigured assimilated bodies and the effect is superb. To an extent, the gross-out effect may be a show-stopper, but I think it works to a strong degree. After all, what would it really be like if a human stomach split open and a big pair of jaws appeared at ragged edges of the sliced flesh? Also effective is the decision of Mr. Carpenter and screenwriter Bill Lancaster to reduce the number of characters to a minimum. Some might find problem with the picture for only a few of them being defined, much since the alien is devouring many of them early on, this seems to be hardly a problem at all. Best of all is the way in which the filmmakers develop a sense of animosity and tension between them and this is the core effect of the picture. "The Thing," while gripping and scary, is more or less a "who's who?" fright-tale with the cast, headed by Kurt Russell in one of the actor's very best performances, trying to decipher who is human and who is an alien in disguise. The strongest scene in the movie is when the characters, who think like human beings, learn that every part of the alien reacts to pain, so they strap each other to chairs and draw blood before exposing it to a hot needle. It combines both parts of Hitchcock's surprise/suspense theory and utilizes both of them to a hilt. The tension of waiting for the bomb to go off (or in this case, the creature to get loose) is nail-biting.The last ten minutes of the movie, do however, prevent "The Thing" from being a wholesome masterpiece. Its raw power, developed by the aforementioned suspense scene, begins to loosen as it approaches a climax which is unfortunately a little rushed and not striking with as much of the intended dread. It's not that the ending of "The Thing" is bad or not effectively done, it's just not as good as what came before it.However, this is an easily-forgivable weakness, as more than seventy-five percent of this classic is immensely enjoyable. It's a great idea done with skill and affection. Clearly, John Carpenter was in love with the original story and one can feel his affection for it in the way he has cleverly directed it. Best of all is his understanding that it was meant to be a nightmarish tale and his understanding of how much to balance the intrinsic horror and science-fiction elements. Even though it has, in a way, been done, there really is no need to adapt the story again, as John Carpenter has done it in the best way possible, save the very end. It's one of those movies that gets better with repeated viewing and still very effective even when you have seen it a few times and know what is around the corner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just watched this movie, and all I can say is that it is incredible!! So much better than any other horror movie out there! 1.The acting. Kurt Russel is amazing, and the supporting cast does their job quite well. The character of Blair comes close to stealing the show. There have been many critics out there who have complained that the characters are underdeveloped, but who cares? This isn't a movie about characters, this is a movie about characters being eaten! 2. The special effects. This movie came out in 1982, a time period where CGI could have been a plot line in a futuristic sci-fi novel. Sometimes I sit and wonder how John Carpenter could possibly have made those effects. They are Unbelievable. A scene where The Thing rips its way out of a character's stomach and then grows spider legs on its head was revolting, but really well made.3. The scare factor. This movie didn't scare me (I'm used to horror films) but I sure can see why somebody else would be scared. There are some jump scenes that completely come out of nowhere (the dog scene) and some truly creepy shots of the creature. But the freakiest thing about it is the paranoia. Nobody has any idea who has been infected by the Thing, and some characters (Blair especially) are willing to resort to violence in order to settle things.The Thing is an amazing alien movie, one of the best I've ever seen. Watch it--you may be scared, you may be grossed out, but you will never be bored.</fullReview>

Great set up, story, effects and the grooviest "ten-little-indians" thriller i've seen since forever. I just re-watched it in hi-def recently &amp; it still is a gripping masterpiece. I'm finding it hard to believe this film bombed at the cinemas back in '82- what the hell was wrong with people back then? Fortunately it has now achieved the cult/legendary status it deserves. Simply one of the best horror films of all time. Also props must be given to Rob Bottin and his clever use of practical effects. These effects are sooooo much more devastating then todays CG-tastic horrors- they should be more prevalent. Word up</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably John Carpenter at his best, in another words this is a pretty good movie. And a movie that is just great to watch on Halloween night. I especially liked the theme song for this movie, it isn't anything grand but the beat is iconic. This movie left a great enough impact for there to be a prequel and a video game which is suppose to be a sequel. This isn't one the scariest movie I have seen but the tension and especially the paranoia between the characters is really high. And that is one of the main thing that drives this movie, how the characters can't trust each other which makes working together to fight The Thing a difficult challenge. This movie even stands out even now, but I can really see why this movie left a big impact in the the movie industry for it's time. I mean if I seen this movie back than I would have been blown away. Also there is little to no CGI in this which is a plus since it makes the situation a bit more creepy and it also has authentic feel to it in other areas. The special effect was just amazing for it's time and to some degree still works today without looking too fake. Overall this is a well made sci-fi horror movie that still holds up today.8.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest Horror movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's The Thing is one of the greatest Horror movies ever made. This little seen masterpiece is often credited as being a brilliant grotesque piece of cinema, and their not wrong there. A remake of the 1951 Howard Hawks original The Thing from another World is often said to be a more closer adaptation of the short story Who Goes There? by John W. Campbell, Jr. The plot for those who do not know is: a parasitic extraterrestrial life-form that assimilates other organisms and in turn imitates them. It infiltrates an Antarctic research station, taking the appearance of the researchers that it kills, and paranoia occurs within the group. Sounds pretty interesting doesn't it? The Thing is classified as a science fiction horror film, I would consider it to be Slasher film also. To tell you the truth, I couldn't find a single thing wrong with The Thing, its pretty much flawless film. Let me start off by saying that the cast is amazing, the acting is brilliant. Kurt Russell was born to play the role of our assumed hero R.J MacReady. Wilford Brimley and Keith Davids are also great as Dr Blair and Childs. The mixture of paranoia and tension between the characters is brilliant. A fun fact about The Thing is that its an all male cast, presumably John Carpenter wanted it to be more realistic. Let me just say that the special effects and creature effects by Rob Bottin are just simply outstanding, probably the best use of grotesque effects ever put into film, there just simply jaw dropping its hard to believe. Originally released in 1982 The Thing did poorly at the box office and was panned by critics, much because of the release of E.T, a movie that focused on a more friendly theme of Alien life form on earth. I could go on for ages on how The Thing is such a great movie, but I want to keep this review short so, If you haven't seen The Thing before then rent or buy it, because if your a horror fan, this deserves to be on everyone's DVD/blu ray shelf.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well made horror sci-fi film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thing is a remake of the 1951 sci-fi horror film The Think From Another World and it is rarity because it is often considered better then the original. It is also often considered John Carpenter's best film.In the Antarctic a Norwegian helicopter team try to shoot a Husky dog where it runs into an American scientific outpost. The Norwegian seems mad so the Americans kill him. But when the Americans explore the Norwegian's base they discovery they had discovered something and everyone has died. Back at the American base they discover that the dog is really an alien who's cells can copy any other creatures. The Americans do not only have to battle a big monster but each other, as the alien is able to pretend it is human and a spirit of paranoia and distrust is fostered.As a horror it works for a number of reasons. The characters are simply men living in close quarters, playing games, watching videos, discussing what to do, getting annoyed with each other, typical people who have something extraordinary happen to them. They are not your typical horror film jerks, at least not at the beginning. The film also has a very simple but scary idea, who do you trust and when trust breaks down what people are willing to do. It is a scary idea that people you know well could end up attacking you and that a monster can take any living form. But it is not just suspect, there is plenty of gore and the special effects of the monster taking many different forms were both very well done and wonderfully gross. It is so good to practical effects, nowadays it would just be some CGI effect which lacks physicality and threat. The Thing has a very minimalistic style, there are only seven characters, the whole film is mostly set within the base and the freezing outside, it makes for a claustrophobic atmosphere knowing that there is no escape. Even the music is kept to a simple, using only a few notes or chores and only one instrument is used at a time: added to that Carpenter allowed no music at all some key scenes, having more impact and surprise then a musical cue telling the audience how to feel.Acting wise only really Kurt Russell and Keith David (who has an awesome voice) notable members of the cast, doing a decent enough job. Everyone else seems to blend into the background. But overall no one was terrible and overall The Thing was a very well made horror film.</fullReview>

The Thing has some of the best natural special effects ever developed, I almost puked during the couch (blood test scene). Slobber tubes, guts, sh*t flying everywhere.

		<fullReview>I read the short story (Who Goes There?) as a kid and loved it. I saw the B&amp;W late 50's version of the Thing and loved it, even though it was quite a bit different from the original short story. When Carpenter's version came out, I refused to see it. Why? Carpenter, Kurt Russell and the poster. I didn't care for Halloween, I equated Kurt Russell (at the time) with Disney and the poster gave NO HINT of the true nature of the film. I have come to regret all those presumptions. They cost me the chance to see the best monster movie (IMHO) of all time in a theater.This movie is almost flawless. Rob Bottin's FX still stand up 30 years later . . . even with NO CGI! Morricone's score is perfection. The casting is spot on, Bill Lancaster's screenplay is awesome with many, many great moments and memorable lines.See it with an open mind, on a big screen with all the lights out . . . in the winter.

		<shortDescription>Who among them is the thing? Great paranoia horror from one of the masters of horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film to me is the best horror film John Carpenter ever did, trumping another great "Halloween". What he did in remaking a 50's science fiction movie into a super horror movie was just genius. The story has these guys (and it is all males, not a female to be seen) at some sort of research facility in Antarctica, I think. They discover something that has been removed from the ice at another facility, having been led there after witnessing a helicopter chasing after a dog with the purpose of killing it. Well they explore the base and take said dog back to their base, which in turn leads to some thing moving about the facility. It seems to infect or take on properties of those it kills, it is kind of hard to say, but when you find it out it goes all out to defend itself making for some of the most gruesome special effects you have ever seen. I love the scene with the shock pads and the head, who can forget the head? The movie also has such tense moments as you do not know who could be the thing and the group of dwindling survivors gets more and more nervous and paranoid as their numbers go down. The monster effects would inspire a lot of horror movies and games, just look at the recent "Dead Space" video game for things that look like they came straight out of this movie. This movie would also be Carpenter's greatest movie, looking at this one wonder's how he could have made a movie as bad as "Ghosts of Mars". This is also one of Kurt Russell's best roles as well, he and Carpenter always make a good team and this movie makes for a good night of fear, suspicion and gore. The thing could be anywhere...or be anyone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Skin of ineffable miracle. Music like support of dreams,memories, a powerful love, harsh duty, disillusions, expectation, intangible spell and magic silence. Touching beauty and exercise of admiration. But the root remains a magnificent novel. It is very hard to define a perfect film about a master- shadow. At first, for the original form to present the soul of a special style. The words about survival are not music but their impact for the reader may be more fascinated, more profound than any real musical rendition.In fact, "The Thing" is a delicate homage for a lost time, a ambiguous glory of a age of ice, a dazzling brilliance and a melancholic contemplation. In same time, it is a splendid parable. Possession of ineffable, love like ladder between two different worlds, mystery of touching, forms of freedom and meekness, ambition of young man for who the victory is a deep exploration of life's taste, for who the price is more little in perspective of luxurious victory against the others are elements of subtle tale in which illusion is the heart of every existence.R.J. MacReady is ordinary man for who the birth is duty to be somebody. The pilot's duties, the humiliation are elements of a past who must be forget. The triumph, in any mode, in any form must be the fruit of a tense desire.I am a Wilford Brimley fan and this passion may be part of subjectivism but, this movie is not only a novel adaptation, or only a film about an alien intruder. It is occasion to discover the real beauty of life, sadness, melancholia or desire. To discover a possible path to the sense of life. And I believe in this message importance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Sci-Fi Horror Movie Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aliens is a close second, but this movie rocks. Bottin's effects are incredible and the acting and story are all first class. This IS Carpenter's best horror flick. If you think you are a horror movie freak and haven't seen this movie, then you don't know what you are talking about.This movie has some staying power and to date is still one of the best all time. Russell plays R.J. MacReady a helicopter pilot for a US naval/scientific outpost in Antartica. The film was actually made in Alaska so you feel as though you are seeing an authentically made set here. If you can watch the DVD Special Edition it gives you all the back story to making the film itself. There are however a few unanswered questions that you will just have to speculate about.SEE IT, and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent special effects. As in "Alien", Carpenter shows an eerily realistic spaceship wreckage. As in "Alien", it's just one long cat-and- mouse game. But it's very well-made, the special effects are scary and very creative, and the atmosphere captures men in isolation, with no help for rescue. (In the Arctic, no one can hear you scream).. There were some flaws, however. As in "Alien", we have an African American character who has a highly qualified position,no doubt having had to be screened for intelligence,and technical know-how. As in "Alien", he is a jive turkey; a fool who speaks like an uneducated ghetto stereotype. Some scenes called for an emotional response, but the characters took it in stride. When Russel's character and the other guy look at a huge spaceship stuck in he ice, they seem too relaxed. Nobody said, "Wow! a flying saucer!" They didn't even elaborate on it when they got back o the other guys. When the horrific Thing kept warping itself into demonic images of horror, nobody really panicked...they just dealt with it as if it were a rat in the kitchen... At the end, the alien inexplicably attained gigantic proportions. And when I sit riveted to the screen for two hours, I want closure....not this type of ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thing is a complex creature this thing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's The Thing I found very slow to start off with in the beginning and it takes its time in getting to the point of the film. It was lucky it finally got interesting at the half way hour mark because I was starting to wonder exactly what all these guys were doing in the Antarctic.The Thing is a horror movie that relies on sudden shocks and visual effects that take a shape shifter into some bloody but sometimes amusing territories. The title is correct as you don't really know what this Thing is - at first it looks like some really warped spider then the next thing its something else.The characters in this film - to be honest I really couldn't care less about any of them and who died because that is the whole point of the film - to get down to the 'who dunnit' or in this case 'who is it' mystery. And it sometimes gets confusing because you never know who could be it - and it doesn't really explain itself well enough to give you enough clues and hence comes off randomly sometimes.But I will say that it is a fun sort of plot and this 'Thing' is given quite a casual treatment in its entrance. It isn't dramatic but it is a shocker - those poor dogs in particular - and hence builds up suspense quite well and you never know what is going to come around the next corner.It's not really Halloween, but it sure has a thing about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching The Thing for a second time, I realised how good this film is, especially if you consider when it was made. The special effects really are very good, they're convincing, creepy and all kinds of disgusting. Not only are the special effects great, but the storyline itself is pretty entertaining and suspenseful. Although of course the characters never learn their lessons and always underestimate the thing by splitting up, doing things by themselves etc. Other than that The Thing is quite a good eighties horror film. If you enjoy movies like The Shining and The Exorcist I'd say you'd probably enjoy The Thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is the perfect combination of events to elicit a not so subtle jump out of your chair in regular intervals. The characters are convincing without having to observe them for very long. You will never know who to trust and that element plays with you for the duration of the film. The plot is clever and suspenseful and the action starts early enough in the film that you will not wait long before your first eye-goggling experience. Even if you prefer CGI effects over "old-school"...you will be visually disturbed more than once. If you like watching movies alone or with friends, give this one a try. It is definitely not for the squeamish and if you are a "screamer" you will most likely demonstrate your talent several times over. This is my favorite John Carpenter film. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of a kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thing is not only the undisputed best sci-fi horror movie of all time, even topping Alien and Aliens, but probably one of the best movies ever made regardless the genre. Different genres make different movies and generate different emotions, of course, but this movie totally succeeds in evoking a lot of feelings, and doing everything right. It is truly a work of art ? and I am not even talking about effects alone; they are still top notch today, simply incredible for 1982. The Casting is great; all characters are played well and they are all individuals, both fitting the profile of the person you would expect to work in remote areas, as well as making it convincing anyone could later be one of those Things also. Because the people in the movie are all so different, and yet all so human and convincing, it is as if you see the story unfold through your own eyes. This distance of observer to the subject is what great art can keep at bay, and this movie excels in it. All through the end the film stays utterly unpredictable, since almost never we get to know more than the guys in the movie. Therefore, again, it feels like we are there ourselves, cleverly creating a bond between us and the humans in the movie. We never know who is who, who will make it and who won't. But we all hope 'we' make it in the end. Just as in the people struggling for survival in the Invasion of the Bodysnatchers, we feel the sense of loss as the movie progresses and mankind is slowly but surely taken over; the powers and knowledge of the Alien power might be infinitely bigger than ours and its superiority is maybe meant to survive us, but what it lacks is of course emotion, feelings, all that makes humans to special and worth fighting for. The Thing also excels in storytelling. Take the beginning. Action and setting plus players straight away, the landscape of the Arctic, the eerie pulsating beat of the GREAT soundtrack (also 10/10, you just feel the gloomy future on mankind if the Thing gets into civilized areas), a helicopter chasing a dog, the crew just as us looking at it, thinking: what the Sam Hill? Just as them, we will soon find out. Great art, whether it is a story, a painting or a movie, plays cleverly with our unconscious desires, fears and fantasies. What is shown and not told, is in the Thing just as powerful as what is not shown, but only told, leaving it up to us to fantasize. Instead of showing the inside of the UFO, or how the alien looked like in the ice, we see a distant black and white video of the doomed crew in the snow, as if it was an old Arctic exploration team a hundred years ago. It would be tantalizing to see the UFO from the inside, and the Alien too, but to not do it is the perfect choice of the director, leaving it to our own fantasies to work it out, thus creating suspense. We know the alien is old, came from far away, imitated life on a million planets, is smart, powerful and now it wants us. Even the computer prognosis of 'doc' is creepy: if it reaches civilized areas, entire world copied in around three years. But do we really believe in 'this voodoo nonsense'? (Even the dialogues in the movie are 10 out of 10). We do when we see the character Bennings burnt down, howling, with hands half finished, half human, half the unimaginable monster that is underneath, we know the Thing might indeed truly be amongst us. Of course, in reality it probably taps the subject of humans themselves: we are all capable of love, but also of burning Jews in gas chambers. We have wonderful visions, we can be brave, but we also have nightmares and fears. Not all that is human we are proud of. Together with the big picture, also used in the Bodysnatchers, it is all about society getting violent and less human, no government after Nixon can be trusted, et cetera, further tapping in on paranoia. The Thing is maybe not so different from us, maybe it is already here, after all? What this movie DOES show,wow, how magnificent can special effects be? And how unpredictable? The shape shifting of one of them turning into a werewolf cum spider is unforgettable and still terrifying today when I see it. It was lucky CGI wasn't available then, making it all look more organic and realistic than any computer could have made it.The setting of the story, and the movie, is also great: a closed environment, violent weather outside, a violent unseen creature inside: suspense guaranteed. But to keep it from sagging, the story even succeeds changing in the end, when the Thing realizes it has no way out of there, and wants to freeze again, waiting for a possible rescue team to pick it up. It is then not anymore about who is who, but a race against the elements: who will be the last to die? If it is the Thing, mankind will be doomed in the future. In a grand finale we see the whole combined shapes into one monster creature, an idea taken over by James Cameron in the end of Terminator. So when the last remaining character suddenly appears and asks Kurt Russell 'did you kill it?', we know he did, or did he? Perfect dialogue again, indirect, since Kurt Russell replies: where were you? Well, he got lost in the storm and so it is the end, creepy and eerie to the last second: 'how do we make it?' 'Maybe we shouldn't?' Not only a 10 out of 10, but one in a million!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Human horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bought this series of DVD's. Each DVD contains two horror movies. Number 1 has The Thing and Day of the Dead. Both are horror classics, so the series delivers. But of these two The Thing is much better. The production values are higher, the script is more intelligent, the acting is better. The main thing though: the characters are better. These are human beings being submitted to supernatural, or better extra-terrestial powers. In Day of the Dead I couldn't sympathize with any of the characters, but in The Thing it is completely different. And the fine acting adds to this particular. Even though the movie is now nearly 30 years old, it still is a strong one. Being based on a Carpenter story helps, of course.Excellent movie, especially for horror and monster movie fans. But even viewed as just a movie, this one delivers. Strong stomach recommended, especially when the blood is being tapped. It is human horror within the classical monster horror.I rate this spelling movie a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not For the Squeamish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gore films are not for the weak of heart, or those with weak stomachs. After all, the amount of blood shown in these types of films can reach a pretty disturbing level. Then again, that's the objective of the gore film, to disturb and disgust its audience while frightening them at the same time. John Carpenter's The Thing certainly doesn't fail those objectives. According to Wikipedia, The Thing, directed by John Carpenter (Halloween, Escape From New York, Vampires), is a gory remake of Howard Hawks-Christian Nyby's 1951 film The Thing From Another World. Interestingly, both films are based on the science fiction novella Who Goes There?, by John W. Campbell, Jr. The movie's plot is pretty easy to understand. Research scientists unearth an alien ship that crashed into Antarctica, unleashing a dangerous organism that imitates other life forms. After wreaking havoc with one research base, said unearthed organism takes the form of a dog and infiltrates an American research base. The Americans must survive the alien organism's attempt to take over them, which causes mistrust amongst the members. Whose body has been taken over? Which members can be trusted and which members cannot? Starring Kurt Russel (Escape From New York, Escape from L.A.) and Wilford Brimly, the film is full of suspense and will leave you guessing all the way until the end. Although Russel is the star of the film, it is the life-imitating organism that steals the show here. In other words, the special effects trump the acting. Rob Bottin is the special makeup effects creator and designer, who will go on to lend his talents to such films as Robocop and Fight Club (IMDB). The attention to detail is convincing, to say the least. Such detail in color and texture that was put into this film will easily induce nauseating disgust in those with weak stomachs. For instance, there is an autopsy scene that shows a dead person that was in the midst of being transformed. The twisted face and the blood-soaked, mangled body takes a cut from a scalpel, revealing squishy, wet organs. It all looks pretty convincing, which is what makes this particular scene horrifying. During another scene, the alien creature is seen transforming from a dog into a grotesque monster with tentacles and spidery legs. At one point we see the dog's face split open, revealing a slimy, tentacled tongue that proceeds to digest another dog. The victim dog's slimy body can be seen partially digested, with some of its bones sticking out. No CGI was employed here; therefore, it looks all the more real.Besides special effects, the lighting and the music also do their part to create suspense and terror. Overhanging lamps light up the inside base, covering some sections and rooms with shadows at night. The dim place looks cramped and depressing, which is fitting for such a film as this. Low and ominous in some scenes and sharp and piercing in others, the musical score is implemented wisely during the film. That being said, I would only recommend The Thing to those that enjoy the gore/horror genre; especially those that like to pay attention to special effects. As for people that are squeamish and sensitive, I would advice them to ignore this film altogether, as seeing it will only induce nauseating disgust.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent special effects and outstanding original score</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is always a top choice when it comes to the list of classical horrors or horrors of science fiction. After watching it, I kind of realize the reason why it could get so much praise, and I totally agree with that this film is a classic.First thing I noticed in the movie is the special effects which appeared so vivid that can absolutely beat most horrors of science fiction nowadays. Not like some horrors of science fiction, this movie demonstrated excellent qualities not only for its achievements in special effects but also in the outstanding acting and directing. In addition, the sound effects blew my mind as well. As we all know, sound effects play extremely important roles in horrors, and this movie did it in a simple way with straight and simple melody, yet remains in our head for a very long time after we saw this movie. With excellent special effects and sound effects accompanied by outstanding acting and directing, I can't find any reason that this movie shouldn't be a classic.As for the story, all that matters is to convince the audiences of things that happened to the characters. Thanks to the atmosphere establishing by the crew, I thought it was really convincing to me. The suspicions among the members reflect humanity, and most important of all, it offers pleasure for the audiences to speculate the real infected. After all, it's more interesting to guess than to know in advance, especially in such a horror of science fiction. Infection from outer space became a popular theme ever since, but no one will forget to mention this film when talking about horrors of science fiction.In short, this film is no doubt a milestone for horrors of science fiction, and I certainly won't forget the melody for years!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a remake of the 1951 film. It concerns an Alien organism that has landed in Antarctica and now wants to take over mankind by infecting them one by one.The Thing is without doubt, one of the all time greats. The special effects in this movie have to be seen to be believed, all the more remarkable when you consider they were all made from model work. No computer generated rubbish here, just real craftsmanship. Current movie makers please take note.All the acting is very credible and conveys the paranoia and genuine fear these men feel, as no one can tell who is infected.Great musical score by Ennio Morricone adds to the tension. This movie is a must see, though definitely not for the squeamish as the effects are quite gruesome. If you are after realistic alien terror you can't beat this movie. It still packs a punch today and will exceed any current horror movie on the screen. 10 out of 10. Unforgettable!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My mum wanted me to get her some VHS tapes for Christmas. She's worn out all of hers. There's nowhere that does blank ones anymore so I got some movies on tape at an old Mom and Pop on Oliver Plunkett St. I of course picked some movies I like, Cube, The Thing, and Solaris(not really suitable to watch on VHS more a DVD title but the other two are fine.) I wasn't crazy about watching the Thing again for some reason and just put it on for something to watch over breakfast. But I'm glad I did! I suppose it was being a bit older and wiser that made me appreciate it more. When I was young I probably only concentrated on those gross-out bodily effects(which are still awesome although they have more a look of artistic sculpture to them now then real body parts.) But now I could appreciate every other aspect of the film, and it's all superb! The script is brilliant, the film grabs you from the very first scene, it's very unusual and arresting, a helicopter chasing a dog through the tundra, right away you're hooked, and it doesn't let up all the way to a brave and uncompromising ending. There is no fat in the script, everything serves the stories. If you want to know who the characters are just observe how they behave in the situation, there's no need to take time off from the plot to listen to MacReady talk about his time in Vietnam, we can see what kind of man he is very easily. Kurt Russel's performance, and every line he speaks, informs us. He is a hero simply because he does what he has to do, he kills a man(probably as an example) and he doesn't apologise. It's kill or be killed. He's ready to sacrifice himself to protect humankind but he doesn't make a song and dance about it, he has really one speech, it's only a few lines but inspires and says it all. The setting is wonderful, it's something we hadn't seen much of before and it explains how they're not able to get help. Not to mention the lovely juxtaposition of fire and ice. Also how great is it to see a group of capable, intelligent men put their heads together to meet the threat, instead of just being victims waiting to happen. Despite the large cast and the lack of individual attention, all stand out, due to the acting and writing skill. And those great names! If I had one problem it would be what I see as a plot hole, why didn't they bring Childs with them at the end when they went to test Blair. I understand they mightn't have wanted the thing to take over the camp but it seems like they would have all four stuck together. But a small point. All in all a great flick, one worthy of study in film class. Can't believe they didn't make a sequel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguably John Carpenter's Best Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thing is a remake of the 1951 Howard Hawks film "The Thing From Another World," an adaptation of the short story "Who Goes There?" by John Campbell Jr. Hawks did not portray the Thing as it was in the book, that of an alien that could assimilate any other life form (human or animal) while retaining its memories and personality, almost like a more sophisticated kind of zombie. Perhaps due to technical limitations, or maybe to fit with the contemporary conventions of the horror genre, the 1951 adaptation portrayed the Thing as a Frankenstein monster from outer space. John Carpenter set out to change this with this adaptation, not only to make the story more loyal to the book, but to create the ultimate monster, one that was more than just a guy in a suit. Boy, did he succeed! The special effects for the Thing, created by Rob Bottin and Stan Winston, are incredible to this day; it is a much more realistic creature than many of the CGI monsters you see today. It's an amalgamation of all the creatures it has assimilated, including dogs, humans, and any other alien life forms it has encountered, giving it a familiar yet distinctly alien look.Notable cast members include Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, and Keith David. When the characters realize what they are up against, they quickly descend into a state of paranoia, as anyone around them could be the Thing. I would rather fight regular zombies myself. To make things worse, they are on a scientific research station in the middle of Antarctica, with no radio contact, and their only means of transportation is destroyed.The Thing was not successful upon its initial release, one of the great mysteries of the universe, but it garnered a large cult following, and it is now recognized as one of the best horror movies ever made. It is arguably John Carpenter's best film, although Halloween is very close. It definitely has my vote for best monster in a horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first watched this film about 10 years ago, after having seen the original 1950's B&amp;W version and then being told by my dad this one was better. How right he was. From the very first scene, of the dog being chased and shot at by the Norwegian helicopter, everything is highly strung tension. The music helps to add to the atmosphere, as does the horrible isolation of the Antarctic (although not shot there) landscape. All of the actors - Kurt Russell especially - play their parts extremely well and the feeling of comradeship being torn apart by horror and suspicion just draws you further into the story (adapted from the short story "who goes there?" by John W Campbell. There is a prequel being made at the moment, detailing the events up to and including the Norwegians chasing the dog scheduled for 2011. I really hope this upcoming film contains some of the magic of the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A milestone in horror cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter can be regarded as an enigma in American cinema. Admired as one of the leading horror practitioners of the post-Star Wars era, his subsequent output since the mid-80s far from reflect the brilliant filmmaking skills he once wielded. Carpenter regards The Thing as the first of his 'Apocalypse Trilogy' together with Prince Of Darkness (1987) and They Live (1988). In a morbid way, it is perhaps an apt description for a filmmaker whose incredible slide from being lauded as an influential horror master to a run-of-the-mill director of forgettable junk is nothing short of, well, apocalyptic.It is best to look at The Thing as the last of Carpenter's 'Great Horror Trilogy' which includes Halloween (1978) and The Fog (1980). The sudden, inexplicable loss of ability thereafter to even create averagely decent genre pictures is mysterious, and I shall leave it at that. The Thing is science-fiction horror in the mould of Ridley Scott's Alien (1979) but it is set on Earth in the Antarctic continent. Written by Bill Lancaster who loosely based his screenplay on John W. Campbell's story Who Goes There?, The Thing is also an (even better) remake of Howard Hawks' The Thing From Another World (1951).Several men working at a remote research station discovers an alien buried in the snow, or what is left of the alien's imprint in the snow. Now unfrozen, the alien enters their facility in the most unlikeliest (but later quite obvious) of means, especially after the realization that it can change its identity by taking over the bodies of living organisms begins to send shockwaves down the twelve-men team. Right from the start, Carpenter builds a sense of isolation and gloom with wide, sweeping shots of the vast, barren, icy landscape as a chopper flies above it.Slowly, paranoia takes over when the alien starts to attack and imitate some of the men. Guessing games are played and mutual trust becomes a rare commodity. While Alien employs the 'less is more' technique to frighten audiences, The Thing is the direct opposite. Carpenter and his crew of visual and makeup effects artists bring the terror right-in-your-face via some of the most grotesque images ever conceived. Short of describing how nightmarish they are, these images could be imagined as a cross between David Cronenberg (The Fly, 1986; Dead Ringers, 1988) and Sam Raimi (Evil Dead, 1982; Evil Dead II, 1987), a fusion of surrealistic violence, and bodily invasion gore which are hallmarks of '80s horror.If there is a flaw to the film, it is the lack of character development of the supporting roles. This comes as a result of having too many characters (twelve!), more so than from a weak screenplay. It seems like who lives or dies is unimportant because first, the film does not intend to work (other than that of fear) on our pathos, and second, the deaths of these characters (oxymoronically ugly and beautiful) are excuses to raise the bar for cinematic horror to artistic heights. Carpenter could have tightened the film up with fewer supporting characters, so that each could be given the chance to match up (and play along) to Kurt Russell's excellent performance, giving the film an 'acting balance' akin to an ensemble cast rather than Russell and eleven extras.Carpenter, who usually scores his own films, pushes music composition duties to Ennio Morricone whose minimalist soundscape accompanied by a thumping beat successfully help to force an uneasy atmosphere of existential dread upon the viewer. The Thing is a milestone in horror cinema (that I will not argue against). However, I feel it is not the masterpiece that many have made it out to be. But then again, who could ever forget what Carpenter has achieved here? SCORE: 8/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent fright-fest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a fan of this movie since I saw it on video in the mid-80s -- John Carpenter truly accomplished a miracle here, integrating old-school classy paranoia-scares that exemplified Hawks' 50s version of the Campbell story with state-of-the-art gore effects that are so well designed by Rob Bottin and Stan Winston that you almost feel as if you're looking at some kind of surrealist art instead of a sci-fi movie effect. It doesn't really have any sci-fi ideas in it, but it's such a good horror movie that even sci-fi fans won't complain.Kurt Russell plays a self-assured misfit in the company of other misfits, including a doctor played by Wilford Brimley. An extremely unfortunate encounter with a shape-shifting alien breaks down the bonds of human society and kindness and replaces them with the animal will to survive.Ennio Morricone provides a stripped-down score that could easily be mistaken for one of director Carpenter's own. Carpenter's directing is easily what makes the movie memorable. I mean, let's face it this movie has the same plot as "Horror Express" and any number of horrible movies. In many ways it's obviously just an imitation of Ridley Scott's "Alien." But the Russell/Carpenter magic, this time for once played straight, redeems it as does Carpenter's effective suspenseful direction.There's not a lot to say about this movie in my opinion. It's just a good gory suspense/horror flick. It doesn't insult your intelligence but it also doesn't challenge it. The monochromatic color scheme was a good idea because it distinguishes it from other films from this period. Rob Bottin's effects are so gory and extreme that they make me laugh, yet this movie still has the strength to shock and terrify the impressionable. A worthy re-make that put the lie to all the nonsense about remakes being inherently bad, this film will probably outlive even the Hawks/Nyby original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIdeo Discussions: The Thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERShttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC4HArjL4bgWelcome back to Video Discussions with the BRB. The subject for this episode is the Ultimate In Alien Terror: John Carpenter's The Thing.This film is without a doubt an all time classic, but it was certainly a struggle for it to achieve that status. Released in the summer of 1982, it was considered a disappointment with critics and audiences alike. Many people, including John Carpenter and Kurt Russell, attribute this to the popularity of E.T., a film that stands in sharp contrast to the nihilistic tone of the Thing. However, the film found its audience when it was later released on home video. It soon achieved cult status. And slowly, but surely, over the course of the 28 years since it's theatrical release, The Thing has risen to the ranks of being one of the greatest horror films of all time. It's of general consensus that John Carpenter's two greatest films are Halloween and the Thing. And even though I personally am a HUGE mark for anything involving John Carpenter, I would agree with this assessment. Both films have had a substantial impact on the genre, the difference being that Halloween had an immediate impact upon it's release, whereas the influence of The Thing was more of a gradual process, fittingly enough. And neither film, in my opinion, is necessarily better than the other. What makes The Thing so special, and is more than likely one of the major reasons why people have embraced this film, is that it is a culmination of every great aspect of John Carpenter's filmography. In other words, it's the ULTIMATE John Carpenter movie.FOR MORE, CLICK ON THE LINKhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC4HArjL4bg</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the problem with horror movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with the majority of horror movies, and why I dislike most of them, is that the writers are so lazy or inept at character creation. Instead of drawing us into the film we're too often pushed away by their complete lack of human qualities to which we can relate; logic being the most neglected.A horror writer may be skilled at fantasizing a scene or story that is scary. However, when creating the character with whom we should follow into the horror fantasy they too often fail. They resort to having the character make completely stupid or illogical decisions in order to place them in harms way, and keep them there. This makes me want to scream and storm out of the theater or burst out laughing.I did much more laughing in this film. While the story and plot twist is pretty good the main character's actions are inexcusable. When a psycho killer is slowly approaching you with a knife a logical person will not stand and wait. Also that person will not run a short distance then wait for the killer to catch up. This movie should have ended way too many times but instead the cheap thrills just kept repeating themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another winner from John Carpenter!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Putting "The Thing" into my DVD player, I knew that I was in for a great horror film. After all, it's John Carpenter, the man who brought us such classics as "Halloween" and "The Fog." My expectations were correct, and this 1982 spook-fest wound up being one of the creepiest horror films of the 80s.Doing a special project in Antarctica, R.J. MacReady and his crew discover something hidden beneath the snow. It's what appears to be some kind of a ship, something believed to be dated more than 100,000 years old. MacReady and the others should have stayed away from the remains of that ship. Because now, there is an evil, alien force lurking around the base, taking form of the crew. The Thing could be anybody, and it's up to MacReady to find out who the next victim is."Halloween" has always been John Carpenter's scariest movie. What sets his other movies apart from his masterpiece is that they focus more on creeping the audience out than officially scaring them. No doubt, "The Thing" is a very frightening film. But why is it so frightening? There's plenty of gore in it, but Carpenter also wants to make the viewer very uncomfortable. Instead of scaring them, he creates the most horrific sense of paranoia anybody could imagine. The Thing could be anybody, and I found myself guessing who would be the next to fall prey to the alien force. The movie is very unpredictable, and I was on the edge of my seat.The cast is very well-chosen, with great performances by Kurt Russell, Keith David, Richard Masur, and more. These are sympathetic characters, and I never wanted any of them to die.One word I can say for Rob Bottin's special effects and makeup is: amazing. The moments when The Thing attacked were strangely believable, and I could feel the effects. Points to Bottin for creating superior effects.An awesome cast, a great story, a terrifying sense of paranoia, and remarkable special effects make 1982's reimagining of "The Thing" another winner from the master of horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My heart was beating wildly during the whole film. John Carpenter at his best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say my heart was beating wildly, this is Sci-Fi horror/thriller at its best. Now I'm usually not to fond of movies in the horror genre, but this was excellent! It's a movie based on Paranoia, the fear for the unknown, and the ultimate fight for survival.The basic plot is that a team of scientist stationed on Antarctica comes across a helicopter with two frantic Norwgians trying for some reason to kill a dog. The team saves the dog and kills the two Norwgians in self defence. Meanwhile they discover that everyone at the Norwegians base, has either died of unknown reasons or killed each other. They had also found a hundred-thousand year old spacecraft in the snow, and apparently dug something up, which was now gone. Later during the night the dog changes into something hideous and grotesque, they kill it, but that's not the end of it. They soon realize that there's an alien that can infest they're bodies and slowly grow inside them, and any one of the the team that has been in contact with the dog, could be the Thing.Im not going to spoil anymore, and i advise you to see this movie, but I warn you this is not for the weak of heart.The effects were excellent, and prove that you don't need CGI to make a good movie monster. The Thing looked so real, and I tell you, CGI would just have made it look fake. And I'll give the man behind the special effects, Rob Bottin ten points just for the Thing. The acting in the movie must not be forgotten either, Kurt Russel as McReady was excellent and couldn't been done better. The fear he and the rest of the crew projected just helped make the film even more horrifying. And lets not forget, this movie proves John Carpenters great skills as a movie maker.So two thumbs up, and I recommend this film for everyone that is a Horror, Sci-fi, or simply a John Carpenter or Kurt Russel fan. This is a must the See film for everyone with the heart for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece of Sci-Fi and horror...a gift that keeps giving.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now and then you find yourself looking up a personal favorite film on IMDb, both out of curiosity for it's score and to check out other viewer's comments.Firstly let me say, that the current score of 8 for The Thing grossly misrepresents this extraordinary work - and as you wade from the reviews from the 90's to more recent.. you notice a sad slide from appropriate adulation by audiences who love cinema and recognize this horror masterpiece for what it is...to the current dregs, the typical 'its boring' kind of glib comments minuscule minds with microbial attention spans can only manage.These withering mental midgets - the visually and dramatically ignorant, whose idea of character and suspense is gleaned from bad computer game dialog and garbage like Cloverfield where one dimensional characters (the kind they obviously identify with) are terrorized by absurd CGI monsters...all given the most obviously phony 'reality TV' style shaky cam to give it 'authenticity'.The ultimate in fake...manufactured 'reality'.But back to The Thing, which suffers none of those ills...part of the reason this film never found it's audience in the 80's was that it was released in the glow of one very friendly alien cheeseball known as ET. Carpenter's bleak meditation on paranoia and suspicion in a claustrophobic and isolated environment was simply way ahead of it's time and ill suited to the times. On the heels of Close Encounters and ET, audiences were perhaps enamored with the idea that aliens would be friendly cuddly creatures hoping to be our friends.When you compare The Thing to quality contemporary horror such as Let The Right One In, it's easy to draw comparisons with the building suspense and isolation of The Thing - it's probably the most powerful reinvention of a horror story/film ever made.Horror movies are a thrill ride in uncomfortable emotions..thats what they're for..people who complain about this film, simply don't like horror as a genre but are too stupid to realise it themselves. They want all their experiences watered down or handed on a platter.From the pitch perfect acting, superb design, mindblowing and inventive physical effects by Bottin (where are you dude?, WE NEED YOU) and Winston, incredible throbbing drone of Morricone's theme...The Thing is the gift that keeps giving.' I must have watched it a good 20 times and never tire of the deft craft in play. The film delivers on two major fronts...both psychologically (who is the Thing?!!) and visually (some of the most boggling and crazy icky stuff committed to screen).The Thing continues to deserve it's place toward the very top of ANY ultimate horror or sci-fi film list...26 years later, this film deserves to be honored by cinephiles, not derided by small uneducated minds whose tastes are more suited to the middle of the road in happy hopeful endings..</fullReview>

Amazing story and incredible effects for that time. A film that actually CAUSES anxiety and terror,there is a general feel of paranoia in the air. If you like dark movies with frightening and claustrophobic atmosphere,and you have the stomach for a lot of gory scenes, THIS IS a movie you wont forget. For me it is for sure John Carpenter's and maby Kurt Russell's best movie. The acting is very good,the music also. It's a classic. They don't make this kind of movies now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow moving, but with some genuine scares, and amazing effects!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's no wonder why John Carpenter's The Thing has gained a cult status today. The special effects in this movie are amazing, and possibly the best looking animatronics ever in a movie. The scares are plentiful, with lots of effective jump scenes. This movie may be slow moving, but it has enough content to please any horror or science fiction fan.An Antartic research station of twelve men is alarmed when a strange body is found near an abandoned Norwegian research station. It looks like nothing ever before seen. Soon after the find, the team realizes that there is a shape shifting alien amongst them, and it can take any form. The Thing (as it is called) can take over anybody and change them into bizarre monsters. RJ MacReady (Kurt Russell) takes charge when no one else will and tries to find who the monster is. Lots of scares and violently amazing effects ensue.If nothing else, this movie should be remembered for it's animatronic effects. These are some amazing animatronic creatures, and the most realistic looking one's of any of these 80s movies. One of the best looking scenes features a husky dog being eaten by a Thing husky imitator, with it's bloody tentacles wrapped around the dog.The direction is good. Lots of establishing shots are used, and where in most movies this would be annoying, it's fine here. The characters are a bit generic, but they have enough likability to them to make them stand out. The story can be very tense, and many scenes should have your heart racing. The musical score is...OK. It's a bit scarce, with the main theme being a bass pluck. It worked for Jaws, but it's not quite as effective here.This is a slow paced movie, and the action scenes are few and far between, but if you can keep your attention focused on more than just violence, this will be an enjoyable horror film filled with some spectacular special effects.My rating: *** out of ****. 105 mins. R for language and strong violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE THING (John Carpenter's)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even as a fan of Horror, I can tel you that there only a handful of movies worth sitting down and viewing. The rest are poorly written, filmed, and directed.My favorite horror, monster, sci-fi, whichever you want to call them are......#1.The Thing (John Carpenter's), #2. Alien, and last but not least is #3.Jaws. There are a few others but they cannot come close to any one of those. John Carpenter's THE THING.....what a masterpiece. Every element of the flick, was planned, shot, acted, and directed so well. When a scene opened it was shot with intent, direction, and a flow that gave perspective on the entire event at Outpost 31. I know when that one guy fell...looked like he had heart attack. But what I saw was another infected guy that didn't know it. He was just feeling the pains of THE THING taking over parts of his body. And the doctor guy that was locked in the small place, he was obviously infected when he was doing the autopsy. So obvious.And as for the guy who was burned. It is obvious by the way the scene was filmed that after he saw the clothing of MacCready (which meant to him that MacCready had been taken over by the thing), the one he thought for sure he could trust, he committed Suicide.You have to love the scenery, the Isolation, the fact that all these guys have IS each other. Slowly as time goes by, and trust seems overwhelmingly more important, and less available, they are trapped in that desolate location...without contact with the outside world, as a horrific Alien creature with the ability to hide itself seemingly inside any one of them given the chance, makes your skin crawl a bit. Well not so much as INSIDE one of them but AS one of them I should say. ;)And the "gore" Scenes, were awesome. The head walking away!!! The Chest bursting open, the finger of Blair going into the other guys face at the end, oh and when Windows was almost eaten alive, but then you can see he is being infected and transformed into one, and later flame thrower-ed. heheheLord I am asking that Universal Studios would give John Carpenter the total rights to make his Sequel of THE THING.

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter's homage to the B monster movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie many many years ago on TV and hadn't seen it for a while. It was on TV again last night and decided I should give it another go. I am very glad I did because it is a tremendously entertaining horror movie from the master of the genre John Carpenter. The movie concerns a bunch of research scientists who investigate an isolated place and find some kind of deformed creature and take it for research hoping to gain recognition for their discovery. What they don't know however is that the creature is very much alive and it's not long before it starts taking over their bodies. It is then upto the crew to decide which one of them has been taken over by the creature by taking a series of tests cue bags of tension. This could have been simply awesome but it ends up being just great. The problem is not the script or the climax but the fact that it bears quite a bit of resemblance to Alien(my favourite horror movie). For example in The Thing the scene where The Thing comes out of one the scientists body is similar to that famous John Hurt scene in Alien. One interesting point is that in John Carpenter's Halloween the original version of The Thing is playing in the background. Despite it's minor flaws The Thing is a pretty great monster movie and one of the best horror movies of the 80's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Sci-Fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Children both Director John Carpenter and co-producer Stuart Cohen saw the 1952 production of "The Thing from another world" directed by Howard Hawks, which was based on the 1938 novel "Who goes there". In 1976 Stuart Cohen decided to remake the film. It is believed that it inspired the making of the 1956 and 1978 "Invasion of the Body Snatchers " and 1979 "The Alien" as well as the 1981 "The thing" . Since that time a whole plethora of Science Fiction horror films have been spawned using the same theme. Al;though initially a box office failure it became a cult classic and subsequently evergreen profit maker.Since many great reviews have already be made of this classic film I merely endorsing all reviews and fans of this great classic Science fiction film.The film begins with a Helicopter chase of a lone dog in the Arctic winter near a scientific research station "No 31". The crew at "31" witness the crash of the Helicopter and adopt the dog. They investigate and find a strangely mutilated body and another base nearby.Gradually the "31" crew lead by R' J. McReady played by Kurt Russel discover the dog is infected with some strange alien virus that attacks its host and then transforms itself into a copy of the victim. This film effects were almost unique for the time as there was no CGI both Albert Whitlock with special photography effects Rob Bottin ( The Howling) creates the make up a plausible and terrifying Alien creature. Even the the alien form is revealed early on the suspense of the film is maintained as the "31" crew become confused as to is infected amongst them.I strongly recommend this classic sci fi horror flick to all fans of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific film has hardly aged at all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's The Thing is what a remake should be. It takes only the most basic thematic elements of the original, and then takes them in an almost completely different direction. Carpenter gives us a film that is not as taut or suspenseful as the 1951 version, but it is light years ahead of that film in terms of f/x. This film is a lot more moody and ambiguous, as well. This time, we aren't dealing with an actual "man from mars". We are dealing with an organism that can take the form of any living creature. The dozen or so cast members seldom have any idea which of them is human or a reproduction until it's too late.The film begins with a couple of Norwegians in a helicopter shooting at a snow dog from the air. Had the guy with the rifle been an even half-way decent shot, maybe the events of this film would have never even happened. Anyway, the dog makes it to an American compound nearby on the frozen tundra of Antarctica. The Norwegians are unable to explain the dangers associated with allowing this dog inside the camp, and the two are soon dead. Within a few hours, the organism from another world spreads through the dog population in the American camp on to the human crew. The cast starts dropping like flies in some incredibly gory ways as their bodies are taken over by this hostile life form that seems bent on conquering all life on earth. The brutal cold and isolation of this Antarctica outpost don't make survival any easier for the crew, and time is quickly running out on them. Do any of them survive? Watch and see. You may have to draw your own conclusions, however.Is the film frightening? Absolutely. The original film relied more on suspense. The scares in Carpenter's film come mostly from gore-related shocks. Rob Bottin's wonderful creature work has to be seen to be believed. These were the days when you couldn't just sit back and rely on CGI. You had to actually construct these monsters and find a way to make them move convincingly. The gore f/x here are incredible. The cast and acting are uniformly excellent. We get to know enough about virtually everyone who lasts long enough to care about. Kurt Russell is top-billed and gives a typically great performance. He looks to be hiding under about three year's worth of facial hair. Wilford Brimley stands out in an early role for him. T.K. Carter found a lot of work back in those days, and I had not realized that Keith David got any good parts like this so far back in his career.Is this a great film? Not quite. There are some glaring flaws. The film is allowed to cheat by never really explaining just how the creature can morph so easily from one person to the next. Also there are typically dumb moments where the characters split up when they should obviously stick together considering what they know about the enemy organism. The film looks wonderful, and it has some nice homage scenes to the original here and there. Be warned, though. You will need a strong stomach for some of the gory scenes. The R rating is very well justified. In sum I'd recommend watching this film. It never seems to get shown on television anymore, so you may have to turn to Netflix or something similar to find it. 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

Personally I am only a fan of Halloween, The Fog, and The Thing. The other films seem to lack soul.The Thing is a monster movie set somewhere near the North or South Pole. It may have been intended as a horror film, but I have never found it horrifying or scary. I like the film from a sci-fi point of view.This film also 'feels' like a B-Movie with an A-Movie budget (in that respect it's a perfect Carpenter film). Incidentally the best actor here was overlooked in the Oscars, even though he never barked or growled once during the entire film.Pros - Excellent cinematography, atmosphere, effects, characters Cons - Stomach churning effects Overall - Excellent sci-fi film whose ending attempts to give the film surprising depth.</fullReview>

But when it was going quite cheap at a sale i grasped the opportunity.I had seen Escape from New York City, Halloween and the remake of The village of the dammed but this is by far the best john carpenter film. I hadn't seen the 50's version of the thing but after seeing this i didn't bother. The thing is good because of the suspense it carries you sit there wondering which one is carrying this alien. And when the alien shows it self it is rather spectacular. The effects were amazing for the time and the acting was top notch. Although it won a razzie award for worst music i actually thought the music was quite good. Well come on the music hasn't totally wrecked the film altogether.This is definitely an essential horror title along with hellraiser,Halloween,evil dead,the exorcist,dawn of the dead,night of the living dead, an American werewolf in London and so on.</fullReview>

If you thought about it for a million years, you'd still be hard pushed. That's what "The Thing" is all about. At a superficial level, it's a gory, blood-drenched horror show (and full credit to it for its utter gratuity). But probe a bit deeper, and you will find an intriguing exploration of what it means to cling onto your own existence, and then you have to ask yourself: "What would I do to stay alive?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Thing" has come a long way from being virtually ignored in the theaters in 1982 because it was released within two weeks of "E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial," (I lobbied hard to see this instead, but my parents overruled me because I was 9 at the time and they felt "E.T." was just a LITTLE more age-appropriate) to making its way onto the IMDb Top 250 Movies of All-Time list. For that remarkable comeback alone, you have to give "The Thing" and its resiliency some mad props. Myself, I ended up finally seeing this in the early 90s when I was in college. Definitely worth the wait. Its based on the old 1930s sci-fi novel "Who Goes There?" and is essentially a remake of the 1950s "The Thing From Another Planet." Aside from being based on an old novel, it is derivative of many before it the sci-fi/monster movie genre. Think "Alien" but in the Antarctic instead of outer space. But this movie still works on so many levels. First of all, it was one of the few movies in the late '70s/early '80s sci-fi genre that actually had a decent cast (such as Kurt Russell, Richard Dysart and that old geezer -- forgot his name -- who used to do Quaker Oats commercials and always mispronounced "diabetes"). Secondly, the special effects are amazingly good for an '80s sci-fi movie; better than a lot of the crap that passes off as CGI special effects on SciFi Channel. Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, this movie takes a somewhat complex plot (in addition to the "monster runs amok" theme, there's quite a bit of plot and character buildup and mistrust amongst the main characters, weaved in with the "in addition to fighting an unknown monster, we're kind of stuck in Antarctica too" claustrophobia) and does it without affecting the pace of the movie whatsoever. I guess that must be the John Carpenter influence. Whatever it is, this was a great movie to watch, giving you the sci-fi scares without any of the laugh-ability of bad, low-budget shockers. I'm shying away just a bit at giving it the highest possible rating because I wasn't 100% on board with the ending (leaves a little too much to interpretation of what happened to the final two survivors), but I give "The Thing" a very solid 9.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter was probably the man to beat during the late 70's and early 80's in terms of horror flicks, and ranking as his greatest film, is most certainly the Thing. This is a creature horror, a genre that rarely hit's the mark, but most memorably perhaps with this film, and Ridley Scott's Alien, a few years previously (for the best recent example, check out The Descent). The Thing also ranks as Kurt Russell's greatest cinematical moment. This came shortly after Carpenter himself had helped Russell expunge himself from his longstanding Disney poster boy image (In Escape From New York). Indeed the collaborations of Carpenter and Russell always hit the mark, and established Russell as one of the coolest, cultest, action guys of the 80's.Here the story centres around RJ MacReady (as cool a name as you'll get in cinema, perhaps seconded only to Snake Pliskin) and his workmates stationed out in a remote scientific research station in the Antarctic. When a chopper carrying Norwegian's from a nearby station fly's over their airspace, while shooting at a husky, something seems amiss. The Norwegians seem intent on destroying the seemingly innocent dog, and after inadvertently blowing up their own chopper and wounding one of the American men, the remaining Norwegian is shot down. When MacReady and Co take a look at the remains of the Norwegian camp they discover it all but destroyed with no survivors and only a hideously mutated carcass, and a huge crater. As the film progresses we soon discover that the camp was destroyed by an alien shape-shifter, that absorbs the bodies it contacts and takes over that form (the dog, and then down the line the crew members). The genius in The Thing is, from a certain point on, Carpenter builds up the tension between the American crew. No one trusts anyone, and sanity is pushed to the limit. One by one they all get killed by the Alien, or by each other. Above the amazing special FX in this film it's the human interaction that creates the most tension. Kudo's to JC for creating a really intelligent horror.As mentioned the FX are amazing. All the creature FX are top class, and of course done long before CGI came and reared it's ugly head. The FX in this, by Rob Bottin, and also Stan Winston, outdo anything I've seen done in a computer with creature makeup etc. The film is pretty creepy and gruesome at times with some nightmarish imagery, and Carpenter pulls off some brilliant jump scares in the film, some of the most perfectly set up and timed scares ever committed to film.The cast are excellent. There's a host of characters and in the support of Russell, Wilfred Brimley and Keith David are particularly good. Kurt Russell though is the man, playing his role superbly as an actor and as an action man. People seem too quick to remember Willis, Stallone and Schwarzengger as the 80's action gods, when Russell preceded them all. Russell is after all one of the few people to ever successfully pull off the mullet.Carpenter has never exceeded his work here. It's brilliantly paced, shot and edited and Carpenter has a control over proceedings that exceeds all his other work. Aided also by a fantastically uncharacteristic score by Ennio Morricone, who does a very Capenteresque score, and something that is fully of eerie menace. This is without doubt one of the best of its genre. *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't like horror movies in general but I was curious about this movie .. what a classic horror movie! .. Kurt Russell is an OK actor nothing more but he was the best man for the leading role.The plot was unique at the early 80s .. it is more common nowadays .. the story takes place an extraordinary place "The Antarctic" (The Southern Pole) which is freezing most of the time. I believe, it was one of first movies to be shot in such a cold weather due to the technical problems which made it very difficult to shoot in such a weather.The movie isn't great and you would see much better horror movies nowadays. One of the best things is showing the passions of the characters under different situations and seeing the developing of the characters with time is good .. people who face a big danger &amp; pressure like a war or something like that, show their real faces and such terrible situations shows the best of human beings according to scientists. And this is what's so good about the movie .. which I consider the best of the movie.The visual effects were good and the cinematography was good .. especially outdoors.It is a classic horror movie .. horror movies lovers would like this movie.I'm not sure it is a pleasant to watch .. but no harm in watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another John Carpenter classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter is one of the most influential directors in the horror/thriller genres. He has at least four classic films to his credit in my personal order of preference - Assault on Precinct 13, Halloween, The Thing and Escape from New York. I liked Assault and Halloween better than The Thing largely because of their low-budget feel. The Thing, although probably better directed, is a big-budget movie from an established and successful director who was all of 33. It doesn't have that gritty, low-budget feel that made Assault so stunning - although its certainly more testosterone fueled and there is NO female involved in the making of this film. This is the second adaptation of the John Campbell sci-fi short "Who Goes There?" which was first filmed in 1951 as The Thing from Another World. The original was reputedly directed by Howard Hawks but I find that hard to believe. The original was a drag, there was no atmosphere or any of that B-Movie feel that films of the period like Them! or Invasion of the Body Snatchers give fans of those films. There was also a ridiculous love interest angle which added nothing to the film. The John Carpenter remake is actually more faithful to the original sci-fi short story apart from being eminently more entertaining.The basic premise of both films is a group of scientists based at an Antarctic station come across an alien - a "Thing" from another world which starts attacking and killing them. A very similar theme was tackled in Ridley Scott's Alien. Alien, which is actually better than The Thing, was set in outer space and even more scary than The Thing. Its release a few years before The Thing may have been one of the reasons for The Thing's originally dismal box office returns. However, rest assured that the usual elements that make for a good John Carpenter film are all present in The Thing. Namely, great atmosphere, a good ensemble cast, thrills aplenty, a unique musical score (Ennio Morricone this time) and at least one classic scene of nerve biting tension. The classic scene in The Thing is obviously the blood testing scene which just doesn't let up on the tension - it keeps building and building.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that i keep revisiting, and always enjoy. Now, i know it's a remake already - but am I the only one here who would like to see a remake of this remake? And i DON'T mean with cheesy CGI like in "Escape from L.A". The effects in The Thing are imho great for its time, but that's just it.. I'd like to see an updated version. Before Kurt gets too old.. :DGenerally i don't care much for remakes.. they tend to be.. sucky. This, however, would be an experiment i'd like to see made.I ALMOST feel the same way about Escape from N.Y, but having seen Escape from L.A, i know how technology can muck things up and i guess it would be impossible to catch that same feeling nowadays..what with the excellent music-score and Ernest Borgnine and whatnot in the 'original'. I still think Kurt could pull it off, though. :) Carpenter rocks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No greater horror film to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off i got to say i loved this movie. Im also a John Carpenter fan myself. There are 3 main reasons why i liked this movie.One is trust, these people had no trust in one another not knowing which one was a potential thing, and being isolated from civilization was also a great plot. I feel that putting them in the antarctic limits there sense of freedom which in turn, doesn't leave many places to hide. Another thing i really loved in this film were the creatures. For one, there a totally different style of animal with no stable shape or size. Another key aspect is, they are never the same. No 2 creatures in the entire film were alike in the least, they were each unique in form.I also liked the special effects in the film. I feel they are still as powerful in this time as they were in 1982. I feel Kurt Russel did a great job as well, showing a rugged look as though he were untouchable, and yet he shows fear when confronted by a thing unlike himself but does not back down when faced with the task of eliminating the threat of total takeover of the campsite.I recommend this film for any horror film lover, whether your of the new generation or a classic horror fanatic. I hope they will make a sequel, but i'm not so sure it would do the movie justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter's Best Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know many people will disagree and say that "Halloween" is Carpenter's best work and that movie definitely is a masterpiece but "The Thing" has it all for me. Rob Bottin's special effects were so awesome at the time and still look good today. Who could forget Kurt Russell's strong lead character and the great supporting cast? Not only does this movie have truly disturbing gore scenes, it also has riveting action and a binding tension running throughout. The story is outstanding and definitely sequel worthy. Also, the musical score is minimal but provides just the right amount of backing in the film. It's too bad that some of the effects of the Blair Monster had to be scrapped for the final film so that the audience could see more details in it. Highly recommended. If you haven't seen this film go out and rent or buy it today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most horrors and some thrillers rely on isolation to build the tension -alone , no-one to help . . .to save . . to consult. . to believe -this is a long recognised tool. Carpenter goes for the throat straight away his background music eerie comes up as the camera pans across desolate snow capped mountains the bizarre shooting at a dog from helicopter , the awaiting unknowing Americans at play etc. The comfort of the victims is stripped away by layers , they are alone without immediate help already ,the storm strips any hope of help away then they are denied the support of their comrades when the truth of the situation is understood ....alone amongst friends who may not be what they seem - paranoia even man's best friend cant be trusted. Solid acting from all, well shot ,method acting its cold!.It finishes without hope do they live , die , convert? I read somewhere that "you could never put anything on film more horrible than the imagination could supply- and then they made The Thing" . Its John Carpenters best film his more recent offerings pale shadows -please make something as inspired leave the safe Hollywood clique be dangerous again. I have watched it more than any other film .</fullReview>

There's a pretty good amount of violence and the special effects are way better and more invented than the cheap and easy CGI that any half-assed movie contains nowadays. It may be nostalgia to say that the movies have loss the quirky inventiveness needed to think up solutions to all sorts of special effects problems, but there it is.John Carpenter does a good job of pacing the story and action just right and Keith David as always adds a great supporting roll.give 7 out of 10 raise it to 8 if you've got some alcohol</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies in a few different genres. Sci-fi, for this creature is an alien. Horror, there are scenes of gore in here that will set you back aghast. Suspense, the tension that comes across in this film is almost unrivaled, from the edginess all the actors give off in general interactions, to that fantastic blood test scene, this film upon first viewing will have your stomach tight. Everything in this one clicked, the script, the acting , the effects, one would be seriously hard pressed to find its equal in these areas not to mention its better.I must mention Russel in this. This movie set the benchmark for him. He was made for this role, and he was at the right age with the right experience under his belt to make Mac come out perfectly. Other than Kurts performance the other characters played their roles with brilliant acumen. I count all but two of those guys who have gone on to or came from already long and varied careers. Everything every one of those actors do, they do well.Finally the effects. Those do still hold up today as stomach churning and terrifying to witness, all without any CGI. Unbelievably well done. My only complaint is like someone earlier said, I have a hard time watching the dog kennel scene. But even that scene, if you parallel it to the blood test scene for tension and fear, is a standout I've seen very few films match, and all the actors in that scene were dogs! So bravo for 'The Thing' 1982. One of the best films ever made in many categories. I watch it gladly every single time I see it come on T.V.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always loved the movies of John Carpenter and this is definitely one of his best. A classic example of old school horror filmaking, a piece of work that some of the newer horror directors may want to take another look at and learn something from. (I'm looking at you Eli Roth!) On that note, how many other people were as disappointed by Hostel as I was? After Cabin Fever which is basically the bomb as new horror movies go, Hostel was basically crap. The violence was generally castrated, the direction uninspired and the screenplay had none of the fun of Cabin Fever. Yes, back to Carpenter, I remember recommending this movie to a friend who is a big horror buff and loves his violence bloody and nasty. He wasn't too keen on seeing The THing simply because he doesn't like 80s horror and the DVD cover did look distinctly 80s and shoddy. After tying him down and screening the movie despite his resistance all he could say was 'Jeez, that was pretty good.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a horror fan but I am a great admirer of John Carpenters work and, having helmed such classic films like Escape from New York, The Fog and Halloween I believe he is a very understated director. The Thing is possibly his greatest achievement and has all the ingredients you don't see in the horror genre today.For a start the casting is superb, the Kurt Russell/Carpenter marriage is on top form here again as Russell gives gruff coolness to the anti-hero Macready. The rest of the cast members also excel in their roles as they are faced with a terrifying and insurmountable foe from outer space. Ennio Morricone's score adds to the tension and becomes kind of an extra character creating a feeling of isolation for the central protagonists. A vital ingredient for any horror flick.The effects are quite simply years ahead of its time, and I would say the creature still stands as being possibly the most highly original of all time. The idea of having an alien being an infection is a landmark in the genre if compared to such modern bores like monsters in caves or hillbilly cannibals. when the creature reveals its form it is truly heinous and revolting. The death scenes are amongst the most inventive I've seen on celluloid and it will be a long hard stretch to be beaten even by todays technological standards.All in all The Thing is a prime example of how the genre should be projected to the audience and still sets the benchmark for suspense horror today.

The music of Enio Morricone, adding to the suspense. Kurt Russel does what he does best, Keith David is brilliant as always.

		<fullReview>Whoa! Seeing this, one of my all-time horror favorites, amongst the top 250 movies of all times just made me want to pay my respects to it. I admit it's a bit out of its league amongst movies like "Braveheart" and the original "Star wars trilogy", but nonetheless "The Thing" is a very, very, VERY good piece of horror. And easily one of John Carpenter's best ones. If you want to be nasty, you can say it's only a clone of "Alien", but there's more. What makes the difference for me are The setting - location adds to the common theme of isolation, and also to the nihilistic and dark mood; when the last survivors gather, you know they'll just freeze to death after fade out.Characterization is done well. Everyone on the station has a post, a job and responsibility. So, even though Kurt Russell is clearly the lead, the rest aren't just cardboard fodder. They are as potential clones, as potential next victims - and as potential survivors towards the end. Keeps you guessing. Well - written, just like in "Alien" or in "Scream".Benchmark in gory and eye-popping FX. What can I say? Everyone brings this up :D Surely some of the effects are now dated, but on the other hand, some are still very convincing. Not bad for an effects - ridden flick that's nearly quarter of a century old.</fullReview>

Carpenter's movie has second best visual effect I ever seen in my life (Copper try to save Norris when he have cardiac arrest, second best in whole move is 'Dog Canel' scene where Bottin have help from 'dad' of Predator, Terminator &amp; Alien, master of visual effects Stan Winston)..Kurt Rusell is great as helicopter pilot McReady and this is his best performance ever (sorry Snake Plisken but you are on second place) with his blue eyes, beard and ironic "MIster No" type of thinking), Rob Bottin have his best work thru the whole movie (he was 22 then, and already have fine job in best werewolf move ever "American werewolf in London" by John Landis (1981) and do best visual effect ever "Jack transformation in werewolf" - Oscar winning).This first Carpenter movie from Apocalypse Trilogy is truly master piece, and have best soundtrack score in SF movie (Razzie Award for Worst Musical Score I don't care) by legend Ennio Morricone (se Sergio Leone movies and you will know what I mean). I like that brooding, menacing bass chords that say to spectator that movie is depressive, paranoia type. Claustofobia elements is very intensive in the movie (like in "Alien" or in "Evil Dead" first two parts) and you have very good aspects of "who is who" and "who is next and who I will trust".So if you didn't yet see that movie you go on and see it right away (if you like gore scenes you have it plenty)..but if you already watch this peace see then :The Hidden - look like and very good SF movie with Kyle MacLachlan (he as FBI agent again but still goodlike in Twin Peaks)The Faculty - ripe off of alien design like "The Thing" but still good SF movie with young excellent actors and good director Robert Rodrigez The Thing: Terror Takes Shape - documentary movie about the movie Invasion of the Body Snatchers - both versions from 1956 and 1958, great actors and depressive, paranoia type (great ends of both movies is one best in SF and Horror genre).Play the video game caled "The Thing" and see comics with the same theme.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carpenter's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched this many times in the past, but this is the first time I really realized what a masterpiece it is. This is easily one of the greatest horror films of all time, bar none. Everything about this movie comes together perfectly, not a single minute seems out of place. Everyone praises the gore and special effects, which certainly are amazing, however I think the real highlight of the film is the characters. Though it does get confusing at first with so many characters, it's worth it. They all bring a unique personality to the film, they all give it that extra dimension that so many horror films lack. MacReady, played by Kurt Russel, was amazing, one of the all-time great horror heroes. Just when you think the film can't get any better, Joh Carpenter gives us one of the coolest endings that I've ever seen. I wont spoil it in case any of you haven't seen it yet, but I love how open ended it is. This film is a perfect example of John Carpenter's genius as a filmmaker, contrary to some of his recent work. I find giving a film a perfect score looks bad, but this is one of few that deserves every point I can give it.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbeaten in the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I First Saw it in 1986 when I was 16 at a mate's birthday party, in a dark garage.I thought it was cool and forgot about it.I had since watched a few of other horror movies, including the alien quadrilogy. When I decided to watch it again for the 1st time last year, i realised the true greatness of this film. I don't think anything beats in in the genre. I sometimes think of horror as a brainless genre designed for teenagers who don't have access to porn. But this is much more than that. It is, among other things about claustrophobia and natural mistrust of human beings to one another. The characters have a dimension and are not here just as an excuse for horrible monsters and gore. The alien, by the way, is a great SFX achievement, even 20 years after. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie with wicked special effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very cool horror movie with tons of visual style and very good replay value. I even liked the music (which Carpenter usually does himself with mixed results; the Halloween music was killer though-this time it is done by some Italian guy I've never heard of).The acting was great I always like Keith David and I was surprised by Wilford Brimley. I never saw him in anything but commercials before this and I have to admit it was pretty weird to see him in a movie like this. The thing that makes this one great is the claustrophobic feeling and the special effects; they are just plain crazy. Carpenter must have had some help from Mary Jane on this one.It does have one of the stupidest moments in horror movie history in it though. The blood screams when he touches it with the hot copper wire? Umm how?!? My god that was brilliantly stupid. If you liked this movie I would recommend the Alien movies and Mimic, and if you liked the blood screaming I would recommend anything by Ed Wood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top-drawer science fiction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some movies that qualify for the definition 'classic' and this is surely one.Carpenter has made a number of interesting horror/suspense movies, but it is THE THING that truly ranks as his masterpiece.The plot is almost as old as the creature. A group of people go somewhere isolated, stumble upon something very nasty, and seem powerless to deal with it. But it is also a bit of a who-done-it, leaving the viewer to second-guess which amongst a group of suspects might be the real villain. A nice little job for Poirot.The story unfolds with some Norwegians in a helicopter chasing a runaway dog into an American Antarctic research station. After a brief skirmish both are killed. Two of the American team then fly-off to investigate the Norwegian base a few miles away, unaware that the enemy - in the form of the dog - is now already within. What they find at the Norwegian base is chaos and death, and a grotesque artifact burned and frozen in the snow. They bring it back.The artifact must be seen rather than described, and gives rise to one of those truly classic moments. It is placed on an examination table in the medical facility and unwrapped to the bald explanation 'we found this'. 'This' is not clearly seen. The camera shifts at about waist-level between the tightly clustered men, switching between tantalising glimpses of bizarre anatomy and expressions of shock and disgust amongst those assembled. One feels like a child struggling to see beyond a crowd of grown-ups, which heightens the sense of vulnerability. What can be seen is slowly thawing-out; it glistens and drips, as chilled vapour rises.The undoubted star of the show is Rob Bottin, for this and many other frightfully disturbing effects. They are all the more remarkable for a movie that predates computer-generated imaging. What you see is pretty-well what you get: shocks and gore a-plenty. During my first viewing in 1982; when the infected dog's head split open, someone actually ran out of the cinema.The movie unfolds with sustained periods of slowly-building tension inter-spaced by moments of almost hallucinogenic monstrosity. As it gradually becomes evident that this thing could be anyone, members of the group no longer trust each other. That, and the stifling intimacy of small rooms and narrow corridors add to a sense of paranoia.Carpenter employed Ennio Morriconi to provide the music score. This was a wise choice because Mr Morriconi is able to dilate upon the simple themes of horror and suspense in the way that only a professional musician can, evaluating the impact that events may have upon the broader spectrum of human feelings. There is a particularly well-rendered piece during the flight to the Norwegian base, in which the helicopter is seen in long-shot against the huge expanse of frozen wilderness. The music is weighted with string instruments and imparts a sense not so much of horror as one of tragedy and despair - which is what this organism truly represents beyond our own simple fears: the utter destruction of all life on earth.And where there is no music, there is the endlessly moaning wind.The set pieces are simple and entirely believable, from the cheesy common-room where you can almost smell tobacco and stale socks, to the dank frost-bound storage areas. The wrecked Norwegian base is sublimely executed. Notice the pink tinge around the block of ice from which the original fossil was apparently cut, hinting of organic tissue and unpleasant circumstances.This is, strictly speaking, a 'B' movie. It contains no 'stars' except perhaps Kurt Russell. But because of their unfamiliarity on screen, the other actors are all the more plausible as ordinary people. They are aptly chosen and play their parts with understated conviction. Radically, it is an all-male cast, so there is non of the 'romantic' digression expected in most other movies. You are given nothing else to consider but the creature and how to deal with it, just like the actors themselves. This focuses thought and draws you into their dilemma.Horror aside, if you're into thought-provoking science fiction, this is the stuff. The most disturbing element for me was the realisation that such an organism could exist. An anti-virus: this is one that instead of changing host cells into copies of itself, rather assumes a similitude of the organism instead, thereby also inheriting its intelligence. Such a thing could leap 4 billion years of evolution with just one single infection. Imagine HIV with a 3-figure IQ; truly, the stuff of nightmares. I've docked a point because I am fed-up with Hollywood helicopters that apparently can't hover. The Norwegians could have done this and simply shot and bombed the dog to hell. I also think that someone on the American team would have considered putting the animal into quarantine, at least until more was known. After all, the Norwegians would hardly be chasing it for fun. It might perhaps have had rabies. And all animals - including humans - have fleas, lice, or just skin mites. These would likewise be infected and infectious. Then, being nosey, I wanted to see inside the spaceship. Finally, check-out the scene where the monster has absorbed the other dogs and throws-up two big arms to punch a hole in the roof. As it hauls itself up, you hear the sound of a squeaky winch or block-and-tackle, which one suspects is what they used to lift it; but whoever forgot to oil the wheels also forgot to edit-out the noise.The quirky ending suggested a sequel, but - for whatever reason - it never happened (good job Sigourney Weaver wasn't in it).Don't dwell on my nit-picking though; this is definitely a collector's item. In half a century, movie buffs will still be talking about THE THING.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First and foremost: THE THING is one of my favorite movies. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the many insightful critiques and deductive conclusions concerning this film. The writer/director definitely left the ending open for a possible sequel. Moving the discourse and discussion in another direction, ponder this: "Why was the 'alien' constructing the space ship?"Is it reasonable to assume the alien (who obviously was extremely intelligent) had little to no interest in the Earth?Perhaps the alien was only constructing the space ship in order to leave Earth and return home.Best, ...Steve usmcshoreparty@aol.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thing excels at every level.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie deserves mention amongst the greatest horror movies of all time. It hits the right note on four levels: visual, aural, intellectual, and emotional. The special effects hold up as some of the most disturbing that have ever been filmed. They aren't quite perfect, but given the subject matter you will have a tough time thinking of how they could have been done better in 1982 (or now, in today's impressive but hokey looking CGI). The sound of the Thing when it screams in pain is otherworldly and memorable. The movie gets you to think about how you would react in this situation, about the ramifications of such a creature existing, and about what actually happened since so many burning questions were left unanswered. It also hits the all-time height of paranoia, where your best friend could have been taken over by an alien with no regard for your or anyone else's life, and has the ability to kill you and take you over with a simple and easy touch. And the only way you will know whether the guy next to you is the thing is by harming it, and therefore, releasing it where it will destroy what it can in self defense. The only way to kill it is to burn it. You can't wound it because it can quickly repair itself by reforming itself. You can't freeze it. It survived 100,000 years of being frozen in the ice of Antarctica. You can't dismember it, since every cell is a being unto itself, capable of killing and imitating its victims.If you are into horror and sci-fi, this movie will impress you and keep you guessing, thinking, and hypothesizing. Whether you are squeamish or hard-stomached this one will stick in your memory. If you like happy endings, this will upset you. Regardless, it will leave you wondering what happened both during the movie and after its conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of John Carpenter's best films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the winter of 1982 of Antarctic. Twelve Men (Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, Keith David, Donald Moffat, T.K. Carter, David Clennon, Thomas G. Waites, Richard Masur, Charles Hallahan, Richard A. Dysart, Joel Polis and Peter Maloney) are living together in a research scientific encampment. An creature from Outer Space has been awakening from more than 10,000 years from another camp. Now the creature is killing one by one... killing off its inhabitants.Directed by John Carpenter (Big Trouble in Little China, Ghosts of Mars, Village of the Damned-1995) made an strong terrific horror/suspenseful/sci-fi/thriller. When this film was released in 1982, it was an box office disappointment. But this film went on to be an cult favorite on video and television.The original 1998 DVD has an strong non-anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an excellent digitally remastered-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD also has an amusing commentary track by the director and actor:Russell. DVD also has an entertaining documentary with the cast &amp; crew, outtakes, original theatrical trailer and more.The new DVD from 2004 does have an anamorphic widescreen transfer and the same DVD extras expect the isolated film score by Ennio Morricone (Which it was oddly placed in the documentary instead of the film in the original DVD). One of the highlights of the film is the horrific and excellent make-up creature effects by Oscar-Winner:Rob Bottin (The Howling, Legend, Total Recall). The Thing is the first Apocalypse film by Carpenter. Which his two another apocalyptic films are "Prince of Darkness" and "In the Mouth of Madness". Certainly one of the director's best work. Panavision. (**** ?/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film from Carpenter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching The Thing From Another World, I was expecting to be disappointed by remake The Thing. Boy, I was wrong. The Thing is excellent remake, if I ever seen one. Usually, I don't approve of remake but John Carpenter did fantastic job on this one. From what I heard, The Thing is more faithful to the original story than the predecessor The Thing From Another World. But The Thing is perhaps one of the best horror films if I ever seen one, although I confessed that I'm not expert in horror genre like some folks are.What makes The Thing different from its predecessor is that it creates its own universe, along with its own set of characters. That's why The Thing, along with handful of remake, is one of the successful remake films at where millions and millions of remake had failed. Kurt Russell, in one of his best roles, is fantastic as MacReady whose took charge of the base when bad stuff occurred. The set up in The Thing is very different from original film, which set the tone for whole film. I find it very hard to explain what the set up is like so check this one out.The Thing is fantastic because it doesn't rely on CGI, which is astonishing. The special effects are top notch and have held up very well to this day. One of the most entertaining horror films ever made and it's just very exciting from beginning to the ending. If the studios want their remake to be very successful, they should take notes from The Thing. It's very solid film of its genre.The actors are fantastic and didn't try to outperforming each other but they're perfectly content with their roles, which is good. Carpenter's direction is top notch and his handling of the material is just fantastic. It's great. Like its predecessor, The Thing has held up very well, which isn't something that happens to every film.Carpenter was very smart to place The Thing on South Pole instead of the North Pole, where The Thing From Another World had been placed. We can see that Carpenter isn't being pressured by the original film; instead he just focuses on constructing original screenplay that is based on short story, which is very smart thing.The DVD of The Thing is one of the handful best DVDs I've ever seen. Solid presentation of the film and very nice special features, which is very seldom seen in this day where studios like to put lot of fluff and talking heads on their special features. I think I'm going to get DVD of The Thing once I get my hands on DVD of The Thing From Another World.One thing I have problem with The Thing is the music Ennio Morricone had produced. It just sounds bit out of place and very electronic. But when used properly, it's great. It's only thing I have complaints about this one.Very solid stuff. Highly recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was never a John Carpenter fanatic before seeing The Thing. That is probably why it took me until last week to see it for the first time. Sure I think Halloween and Escape From New York are classics but he's always been a director that has as many misses as he's had hits in his career.The Thing is as close to perfection as any movie I've even seen. Start right at the end, I love the fact that it has a apocalyptic ending where we assume the two survivors are going to die. It is also very open ended and open to interpretation. Did The Thing really get destroyed? Is Childs really still human or is he part of The Thing? The way this ends is in stark contrast to most Hollywood movies that feel the need to have a happy ending and tie up all the loose ends. I had the benefit of watching the Special Edition DVD which includes an approximately 90 minute documentary with tons of great facts about the production and interviews with everyone that was anyone on this production. The documentary revealed that they actually shot an alternate ending that shows that Kurt Russell's character MacReady made it out of Antarctica and survived the whole ordeal. Luckily that ending has never seen the light of day.More then a monster movie, this is a movie about isolation and paranoia. This is about a group of men, living in close quarters without any female elements. That group dynamic adds a lot of interesting elements to the emotional side of the story.If for some reason you've never seen this movie....go see it now! And get the Special Edition DVD for the documentary. Even if you have seen the movie, get your hands on the documentary because it will give you a new insight into the movie and into the genius of John Carpenter as well as the effects team that brought the monsters to life.</fullReview>

The Thing was the 1st and only movie that I have ever gone gone to by myself. This is by far one of the best movies that I have ever seen. I believe that the public would very much like to see this movie continued into a part 2, based on the ending of the first movie. I would like for anyone with any contacts to point me in the right direction to audition for a role in the new movie. I am 6.2 and weigh 220lbs with exceptional acting skills.

The movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. This movie views on television often and I find my self watching it again and again. I hope that someone reads this and do the fans a favor and do a remake or a part two. This movie has left fans on the edge of there seat and wanting more for far to long. I been waiting to see previews for a part two or a remake for a long time. Now I would not only like to see a remake or a part 2, but would also like to have an opportunity to have a role in the movie. Thanks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thing is a frightening movie, because the shape-shifting alien is too disgusting with its multiple misshaped limbs and slimy tentacles. When I see it, I get chills and in more, the action takes place in a frozen and lost land that is Antarctica.Kurt Russell did a great job with this classic, and I wish to find it in store to buy the DVD, cause I like sci-fi films a lot. Also, it's mixed with viscous horror to freeze you dead.Finally, I think that when we see "traitors" becoming deformed monsters is truly awesome for a 1982 movie (a big thank to Stan Winston's awesome talent), and it makes it a classic reference of the genre to view absolutely.Steve Baillargeon</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguably The Best Horror Film Of All Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's 1982 remake of Howard Hawks' film The Thing is considered by many to be the best horror film classic of all time. Surprisingly, this film didn't do well at all when it was released in 1982. It was competing with E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial and failed miserably at the box office. In fact, Carpenter could barely find work as a director afterwords. But since then, The Thing has become a cult classic horror film that has influenced generations of filmmakers and audiences alike. This film has an all-star cast which includes Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, Keith David, David Clennon, and T.K. Carter.Set in a snowy military compound, a lone wolf wanders into the compound after being savagely hunted by a foreign military. Soon enough this group of men realize they are dealing with something much more dangerous than just a wolf. If you haven't seen John Carpenter's The Thing, you are in for a very big treat.

		<shortDescription>A Classic Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes 'The Thing' such a great film is that you appreciate it more and more every time it is viewed. What sounds like a fairly average monster confrontation, it achieved so much better due to its way of thinking:"Less is more.... but when you want more, you go over the top!"It may not be expected but there are actually few monster scenes during 'The Thing'. Suspense is drawn and a huge amount of time is given for the characters to develop, particularly the way they interact with one another. As well as each member being very believable, you can imagine that such a team actually exists. As with the more well known 'Alien', seeing the characters goof around by eating, playing pool and the like draws you into the experience far deeper than just letting an actor play a stereotype. Some of the script is also hilarious, such as the captains suggestion on the couch.Once the scene has been set, the fairly sedated start wakes up with one hell of snarl. You have never seen any monsters before like this, not ones which look so realistic. Todays audience is constantly bombarded with CGI effects, to the point where we can instantly tell when they are being used. 'The Thing' is 'Old School' with its effects, displaying some truly unbelievable anamatronics. For todays audience, we are able to spot the flaws in these effects, but at the time I imagine that the audience would of been absolutely stiff in their cinema seats. To put it straight, these are some of the best effects ever to grace a film. Its worth bearing in mind that 'The Thing' was beaten to the Oscar for special effects by 'E.T, the Exrta-Terrerestral'. Hmm.Saying this, we all know effects don't make a film. But they certainly add to the atmosphere. If the film was remade with CGI effects, it just wouldn't have the same effect. The film also stands head and shoulders over other horror films due to the 'Who did it?' element that is maintained throughout. You will be constantly guessing who 'The Thing' really is, adding another physiological element to the film. However, there are some aspects which stops 'The Thing' from being truly great. The music throughout is fairly dire, and laughable when you give it attention. The ending to the film is also quite a disappointment, snatching a satisfying conclusion just from the viewer at the last minutes. When viewing the film as a whole however these points are particularly minor, especially considering what this film has going for it.'The Thing' is a film that will not leave the viewers memory for a long time, and is one you will certainly be telling your friends you watched last night. There isn't anything else out there quite like it, which is a crying shame. If all horror films were more like 'The Thing', the world would be a better place...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is, what John Carpenter calls, his first movie in his Apocalypse Trilogy. The second was Prince of Darkness (1987) and the final one was In the Mouth of Madness (1995)."The Thing" is Carpenter's most terrifying movie till date. Some research scientists in the isolated Antarctic encounter a deadly shape-changing alien, who absorbs other organisms in order to create a perfect imitation. This alien attempts to take over this doomed team of scientists one by one.There is not a single boring moment in this movie. The narrative is smooth. The atmosphere throughout the movie is very tense and suspenseful. The acting from most of the cast is amazing, with special mention of, Kurt Russel and Keith David. The display of paranoia from all the characters/actors is nothing short of brilliant! It really convinces the viewer that no one can be trusted!Other aspects: The score is wonderful and haunting. The gore effects are of course, fantastic, as the reader might already know!All in all, a great package; a true horror classic.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's true, The Thing is one of the best horror/sci-fi movies of all time, definitely the best out of John Carpenter's Apocalyptic Three (The Thing, Prince of Darkness and In the Mouth of Madness).There are certain movies that can make me love/hate a certain actors and actresses and The Thing is the movie that made me love Kurt Russel. Playing the part of MacReady he comes across as one of the more memorable bad-ass heroes in our time: long hair, full beard, shotgun, whiskey and the weirdest hat i've ever seen in a movie... what's not to love? Okay, that aside, the acting IS stellar. Paranoia and suspicion are the leading emotions in this film and you really begin to wonder which of the handful of men in the outpost are infected by the alien. Keith David and Wilford Brimley are definite stand-outs in the acting department.The special effects are also quite a treat. Considering that it was released the same time E.T. was they're both realistic, disgusting and terrifying.... hilarious, if you, like me, have seen the movie upwards of twenty or so times.It's nice to see a horror movie without the dynamic of love, sex or romance in it. This movie is raw and brutal. Once you've seen it there wont be many other horror movies that can really 'do it' for you.I can't recommend it highly enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on Campbell's book, ?who Goes There? and comparing it to Aliens, I would only say this; The Thing is far more suspenseful. Russell playing his opposite, in this case Ripley is more realistic while Weaver is more stoic. A sequel should be made. Russell and Childs as you know were still alive at the end but of course being in Antartica, there was no chance they survived? Maybe they did. It will take a good writer to act on this and add to Campbells original concept. Overall, this movie is much more intense than Alien. The 1950 version with Kenneth Tobey and of course, James Arness playing The Thing was a scary movie when I saw it the first time. It gave me nightmares!

		<fullReview>I remember when this came out and how it was pounced on as simply a superficial gore remake of the '51 version. The reviews at the time were silly and relied on memories of the previous version while ignoring the fact that this was not a remake. Not to mention how ET was the darling of all involved (I will never understand how ET made so much money, It was a minor bit of confection) This film is not a remake of "The Thing From Another World" though it does use elements of that version of the story as an homage. This is an adaptation of the story "Who Goes There?" which the other film also used as source.The '51 version is a great film worth watching, but it is a very different movie with an approach based on the time it was made and should not be used as a comparison to Carpenter's "The Thing". Well, now that I got that out of my system...This is a gory film in the sense that it shows all sorts of bizarre and gruesome events in astonishing FX sequences, however they are not there simply to be grossouts. The scenes are essential because they demonstrate the nature of the alien and are actually fascinating. Seeing how the creature is formless and just a mad collection of what it has infected can only be expressed through the scenes some find so repulsive.When the dogs are infected how they begin to morph makes me think about where the creature came from and what other previously absorbed creatures alien dna is influencing the process. Every time an infection/transformation takes place it is so bizarre and seems to meld different species and biology. When the humans get infected I wonder does the creature have intelligence? Does it retain knowledge or simply mimic? Where did the creature originate and how many others has it infected? What if it eventually infected everyone? The actions of the team are understandable and realistic to me, they have no clue what is going on most of the time and some of the complaints I have read tend to come from people who are looking at this as if the characters should have known what the viewer of the film does.The characters split up numerous times but each time it is obvious why they do. Either they don't know the things the viewer does or the situation demands it.I have read some comments about how the characters are not fleshed out and the FX take it over, the people who say this saw a different film than I did. I remember each character distinctly. They all have scenes where they become individuals we recognize and their characters nature are essential to the progress of the plot. Watch the movie once and each character is memorable. At no point are the characters interchangeable fodder like in so many other Horror/SF films. The actors are all distinct fully realized and the performances are memorable and unique.The film doesn't spell anything out, it is a great example of both SF and Horror. It is thought provoking and truly scary and it also has a perfect ending.Great Ennio Morricone score, great cinematography, the best performance by a dog ever, great mystery, and the list just goes on. This film, with precious few changes (some computer scenes date it), could be released today and would be hailed as a masterpiece and make a fortune.Was Childs infected? Was MacReady? What happens next? Great film.It also has my favorite line in history. Palmer's reaction to the spider-head... "You Gotta be F**king kidding me!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The terror, panic, and paranoia in this film has been matched by no other. The arctic setting made it better because there literally was no escape. And you obviously spent most of the film trying to figure out who was infected.A great cast. The only semi-dud was Richard Masur (Clark) sleepwalking through his role. Although he usually does that in most his films and it served as a good balance for the other intense characters like Childs, Windows, (where did they get these names?) and Mac. Kurt Russell was perfect in the lead but Donald Moffat nearly stole this film as the Captain. An excellent mix of personalities all around. The gore effects might be too much for some though.An added bit of trivia. The late Charles Hallahan (Norris) went to college with my parents. I don't mean they just went to the same school. They knew each other. I just thought that was worth a mention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film in the Scottsdale 6 drive in (yes they were still around) in Phoenix when it was released. Everyone has covered the particulars well enough already so I won't. If you think it freaked YOU out, imagine seeing this movie with your buddy and our then girlfriends while tripping on mushrooms!!! I'll never forget sitting on the bed of a pickup, beer in hand, staring widely dilated at the screen watching a man's head that has just "oozed" off his body spew a three foot tongue around a table leg, pull itself over, turn upside down, sprout spider legs and start walking across the floor :-O . Among many other totally out there, horrific scenes. I think I still have the bruise on my arm from girlfriend gripping it. I've seen it at least 50 times since and own the special edition DVD. Suffice it to say, if you're a fan of scifi/horror, particularly a younger fan and haven't seen this flick, you have not yet been baptized. Like others have said, despite all the technical advances since, story, effects, acting, music, direction, it doesn't get any better than this. Tiribulus -Detroit</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved it, its terrific one of the best horrors I've seen in ages. I remember it from when I was younger, on viewing again it was just as good if not better! This film contains some of the most shocking visuals in any horror.Researchers out in Antarctica alone stumble across something buried in the ice, which turns out not to be very friendly... the film follows what happens to them all.The whole desperation of the situation is so intoxicatingly brilliant that it builds to a Russian roulette type scenario where we're going to find out who is the alien, in one of the highlights of the film.When the alien shows itself on many occasions the special affects are superb. Better than anything I've seen using computer trickery the visuals are like something from hell - I still struggle to keep watching throughout! The scene where the doctor is trying to resuscitate someone who has died is a truly haunting moment - you have to see it.Loved this film make sure you watch it... in the dark :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the perfect HORROR movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must have seen this film about a hundred times, I have told "horror fans" the world over that this is a (MUST) own. If it wasn't for this film, I do not believe we would have the (quality) horror films that came later, simply put: John Carpenter's "The Thing" paved the way and wrote the blueprint for all that followed. 1982 was by far a turning point for special effects, and The Thing delivers it by the truck load. Mind blowing creature effects, blood, gore and a fantastic storyline to pull it all together. R.J. MacKeady (Kurt Russell) is a hard-edged government man stranded in the north pole on a research team, when they come across someTHING in the ice. Carpenter blends comedy with horror and gore to a glorious conclusion, the acting is top notch and the characters are believable through out. The scenes are paced so that you truly are on the edge of your seat and when the horror starts, it throws you out of your seat. The special effects completely blow away anything you see in today's so called (horror) movies, and Carpenter deserves an award for pioneering the genre. My hat is off to you Mr. Carpenter, PLEASE BRING US SOME MORE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"First g--d--- week of Winter." With that line, Kurt Russell as R.J.Macready, the rock solid helicopter pilot, paints a bleak picture of what is to come in John Carpenter's The Thing. Twelve men living in the Antarctic are confronted by a mysterious and terrifying "Thing" from outer space. The Thing it is revealed, crash-landed 100,000 years ago and frozen, was dug up by a team of Norwegians who allow it to thaw with disastrous consequences. After arriving in the American camp in the guise of a dog, the Thing goes after Kurt Russell and his comrades, killing and replacing them, one by one. Who is human? Who is the Thing? The air of paranoia and suspense are practically palpable in a movie that if it does not scare you, then you are already dead. I love this movie. I watch it about once a month. Based on the short story,"Who goes There?" by John W. Campbell Jr., John Carpenter's picture has a group of regular guys thrust into highly irregular circumstances, threatened by a creature that can imitate exactly any living thing it touches. An all male cast and claustrophobic sets are a few of the unique aspects of the production. I see something new every time I watch it. Wilford Brimley is cast as Blair, the scientist who discovers the true nature of the Thing and decides to save the world,isolating the research station by destroying their transportation and radio equipment. Beautifully shot in Canada and Alaska and using then (1982) state of the art special effects, The Thing is the perfect movie to curl up with on a cold Winter's night. The characters are entirely believable and their sense of isolation and panic are easily felt by the viewer. Beware, there are some squeam inducing scenes with plenty of alien goo and guts. I highly recommend this movie for all those who love suspense and horror. I think it is also some of Kurt Russell's best work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never realised it before but I'm a bit of a John Carpenter fan. I still don't like Halloween though, I find it an ordeal to sit through.This on the other hand is pure brilliance. The story revolves around a group of American researchers on an Antartic research station. After rescuing a dog from a seemingly crazy bunch of Norwegians (or were they swedes? ;)) they start falling host to an alien being that can imitate anything it assimilates. Cue plenty of suspense, paranoia and gore.This film wouldn't have worked anywhere else. The sense of isolation and hopelessness adds to the claustrophobic horror of the film. The characters, especially Carpenter veteran Kurt Russell are fantastic. It may seem on the surface a simple horror film but its so open at the same time that you can read anything into a particular scene or conversation. You feel just as paranoid as the characters on screen. Its wonderfully done. Its a testament to the film that it is being so hotly debated 23 years after it was released. I'm still not quite sure who was who, even right at the end. Whether this was intentional on the filmmakers part or arose simply because of the nature of the story I really cant say but its a major part of the films appeal.The film is also well known for its gore and creature effects which are still fantastic even today. In fact in the wake of CGI snoozefests they can be appreciated even more. Some scenes such as the defibrillator scene are simply shocking upon first viewing.A lot of films seem to focus on one aspect of horror, whether it be gore, suspense or psychological. The Thing defies convention and masters all of them effortlessly. One of the greatest horror films of all time and one of my personal favourites from any genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Desert Island Movie Keeper !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is perhaps one of the most under-rated, yet best sci-fi/horror movies ever made. It's hard to believe that this movie is almost 25 years old but it has aged well and looks as fresh as ever.John Carpenter has made some good films here and there but made A lot of dogs. However, sometimes...and I mean once in a lifetime kind of "sometimes"...everything will click and you got yourself one damned fine film. This is Carpenter's "click".Ingredients: A great premise story by the late John W. Campbell Jr., an absolutely spectacular ensemble cast who, even back then was somewhat unknowns but they all cut their teeth on the stage. I mean really, Richard Dysart, W. Brimley, Peter Maloney, D. Moffat, Richard Masur and Tom Waites, all damn fine stage actors. Sorry to name drop but the producers either were brilliant and/or extremely lucky to pull off this cast for an ensemble piece about paranoia. Great cast! And to really put the icing on the cake they have the edgy special effects guy, Rob Bottin, who was really just a kid at the time pulling off amazing special effects (yes, this is before CGI, kiddies) with a budget that I use to buy groceries with. He was years ahead of his time.The litmus test for me was to show this to my 15 yr. old son and a few of his buddies one Friday night. They were glued to the TV; from the opening scene where the Norwegians were shooting the wolf from the helicopter to the end scene where Mac and Childs make veiled paranoid small talk amidst the carnage that was once their camp. They loved it and were blown away when I told them how old it was, but I think the scene with Mac and that lame chess computer sort of dates it. LOL.If you watch this on DVD, make sure you see the Collector's Edition from Universal. 5.1 sound with bullets whizzing by your head. This would be one of the five movies that I would take to my deserted island bungalow. Heh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kurt Russell, gun-toting Norwegians and a spider-head</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Claustrophobia has never been so terrifying and featuring flame-throwers so prominently. John Carpenter and Kurt Russell manage to blow up a huge chunk of Antarctica in this brilliantly gory film, that portrays extra-terrestrials not as Reese's Pieces eating domiciles but graphic shape-shifters that slaughter dogs, not too mention, well, all of the cast. The mood of the movie is summed up by MacReady's speech halfway through briefly after the barbecuing of an alien replicate; "I know I'm human. And if you were all these things, then you'd just attack me right now, so some of you are still human. This thing doesn't want to show itself, it wants to hide inside an imitation. It'll fight if it has to, but it's vulnerable out in the open." It goes without saying that out in the open is below 40 - a testament to 1980's science fiction fatalism that ranges from the apocalyptic future of The Terminator to the selfish corporatism of Aliens - as the base members either become devoured or go insane. Stepping up as the unlikely hero is the protesting helicopter pilot John MacReady, who takes to wearing a cheerful sombrero and gets steadily drunker as the other men drop like flies. 'Cabin fever' seem to be the key words when the survivors barricade themselves in; The Thing is the best fictional depiction of paranoia bar none. Even MacReady threatens to set off explosives when he is subjected to an inquiry. Following the routine thriller build-up of viewing a previous team's demise and Kurt Russell yelling "Sweden!", the movie does not offer an uplifting moral or ending - the team is seen as inevitably doomed and its a matter of taking the alien down with them. The movie supplies some eye-popping moments such as an unfortunate chap getting his arms bitten off by a stomach with fangs and a head detaching from a body and scurrying around on stalk legs (cue the token stoner to exclaim "You gotta be f*cking kidding.") John Carpenter delivers in this organic matter-spattering classic, the gruesome effects and the suffocating atmosphere still a good time almost a quarter-century on. There hasn't been a horror director since that has looked so closely at the darker side of human nature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is top notch. I personally consider this one of the best horror movies. This was not only a fantastic horror movie but it also popularised the horror sub-genre "body horror." It is fantastic in almost all aspects of horror. As I sat through watching this the first time, the tension put me in constant suspicion of who really was "The Thing." I was also constantly surprised when I saw one person after another reveal themselves. The atmosphere was also superb as it showed to you that there was no way out of this cold hell. It was also very violent and it certainly doesn't let down on the gore. Many a time the violence made you blurt out "good god!" The only drawback to this classic is the lack of jump factor in the film, but nonetheless it is a fantastic film. Also I recommend that those who enjoyed this film check out the play-station 2 game "The Thing" which although having the same name as the film, is a sequel in story terms to the film. And that's a wrap!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the basis of given scares, The Thing pretty much is the only film that has managed to scare me on my adult age. Sure, there are some films that are just creepy, but this has managed to scare the life out of me.The story goes: A group of scientist find a spaceship buried deep in the ices of Antarctic and decide to drag a frozen alien back to their base. This thing isn't dead and soon it begins to take the appearances of the scientist and their dogs. Soon everyone suspects everyone. Who is human and who is alien.When you look at the effects it's surprising how well the grotesque puppets have taken the stand of time: they look slimy and quite living. Music gives a creepy atmosphere to film and acting is pretty good, Kurt Russel manages to do one of his best performances in this film. The Thing certainly is from the better of John Carpenter, who has a knack of doing either great films or turkeys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well the thing what can i say. One of the best films i have seen and i have watched a lot of films. The story is well written, the characters and acting are well performed by Kurt Russell and co. and obviously the direction by The Master Of Suspense John Carpenter is superb. I cannot give it a perfect 10 out of 10 because i don't think that any film deserves that but i can recommend it extremely high and say that despite it maybe looking a bit dated effects wise the story will live on forever. The suspense is wonderful because of the enclosed area that the scientists inhabit and the feeling that no one can truly trust each other is unbelievably intense. Although i have said that the effects now maybe slightly outdated i also have to put that at the time they were stunning and the effects designer Rob Bottin should get an honourable mention for making the creature seem terrifying and at the same time with the weird shapes and forms that the 'Thing' had become in the past visually stunning and intriguing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter's first big studio motion picture and he's all business with this movie. From the beginning scenes, an ominous feeling hangs over the film all the way to the grim ending. Thankfully, screenwriter Bill Lancaster adhered closely to the original story by Don A. Stuart- Who goes there? This movie centered around paranoia, which makes for a much better story than the 1951 version. And FX wiz Rob Bottin raised the bar for alien special effects in this 1982 classic, which was a dud a box office. The digital, anamorphic version is nearly perfect, with rich color reproductions. And plenty of extras that satisfy even the most hardcore fans. Lead star Kurt Russell joins John Carpenter for the commentary track. Their recollections reveal many interesting behind the scenes stories. Finally, Ennio Morricone's hauntingly beautiful, dissonant score is a perfect match for this very scary, very dark film. Truly, one of the best (horror) movies of all time on many levels!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When John Carpenter's The Thing was released in 1982 its monster was the most revolting ever put on film. More than 20 years later it's not as shocking, but it's still pretty gross. It's certainly not tame like James Arness' original Thing in the 1951 original.This movie has little relation to the original The Thing (1951.) Instead, Bill Lancaster's script follows the idea of the original short story, John Campbell's "Who Goes There?" John Carpenter follows in the traditional of Howard Hawks who produced the original Thing and is one of Carpenter's idols. Once again Carpenter shows that he can put all of his budget on the screen. He makes a movie that looks many times more than its real budget. This film has high production values. Ennio Morricone's score is perfectly creepy. The sets are claustrophobic.As in the original, the acting is top notch. For a horror film, where characters are usually nothing more than fodder for the monster, each character in this film has a distinct personality. Kurt Russell is perfect as the hero RJ MacReady. Wilford Brimley is great as Dr. Blair. Richard Masur is the scruffy, antisocial dog handler. The rest of the cast is also excellent.The star of the movie is Rob Bottin's Thing. The Thing is flat-out nasty. Maybe this Thing is a modern metaphor for cancer as it infects the crew. It changes shapes every time it appears so you never know what to expect.One of Carpenter's best films and one of the best horror movies ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You cannot help but cringe watching this highly atmospheric dramatic-science-fiction-philosophical-who-done-it thriller.This adaptation of the story "Who goes There?" by John W. Campbell and the Howard Hawks film, "The Thing from Outer Space," takes the fear and confusion to another more personally intense level in the scenes involving the Thing (the creature in the film).There is a dark-nihilist-view in this movie about a force, without human fallibilities, that cannot be stopped once it begins to replicate--as it was said in the movie--this thing could take over the earth in a matter of months. This is (eschatological/end of time)philosophy at its best, the thoughts of losing your identity and not knowing it is, difficult and existentialist at its base.Though the sheer terror in this movie, the shocking moments--the reviving scene, dog pens, worm-generator room well as the pernicious mood that soaks into the audience via the confined spaces, single-gender cast, and severe isolation of Antarctica in the northern hemisphere Summer. Probably John Carpenter's best film, technically and emotionally.If you cannot stomach gore, tingling fear-suspense, sparse set design, acting, direction, lighting, music and love happy endings: you should turn the channel--you will be sick as a dog--pun intended.If only my college philosophy professor at Hofstra had showed this instead of reading Heidegger I might have gotten his point. From that standpoint the Thing is a tremendous film, well as for fans of horror (especially Lovecraft), Keith David, Wilfred Brimley (the oatmeal guy), Snake Bliskin (Kurt Russell) this movie will imprint fear in you for long times to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of those perfect horror films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thing is one of those perfect horror films. Everything seems to fall into place. In short this is a magnificent viewing experience.I assume you know the plot so I won't go into it here. It was a strong move by Carpenter to utilize to original plot from the short story "Who Goes There?". The Thing has the ability to assume the identity of it's host and therefore can go about undetected among the men. This causes the immense feeling of distrust among them and Carpenter milks it for all it's worth. In the original there was simply a guy in a costume portraying The Thing and that was a real letdown.By setting the film in a virtually timeless no-man's land, Antarctica, Carpenter maximizes the utter isolation with it's magnificent snowbound scenery and bitter cold. When all radio contact has failed, these men are quite simply alone in the world. And when The Thing starts absorbing them one by one, up until the point that we have no idea who is left intact, their isolation and despair become frightfully real and tangible to the audience.Carpenter's direction is nothing short of spectacular. This film, along with Halloween and Assault on Precinct 13, is his crowning achievement. Genuinely haunting, terribly suspenseful with an eerie, all to real ending, this is one film you won't forget easily. Ennio Morricone's music, which is very similar to Carpenter's own orchestral works, is quite simply stunning. Operating like a slow, emotionless heartbeat, it enhances the impact of every scene. Another triumph for this movie are the special effects. This is 1982 and I have yet to see a horror film that surpasses this one in terms of monster effects. Granted the effects are disgusting but, very importantly, do not lessen the impact of the story. It never succumbs to being a special effects extravaganza, it's limited to only a handful of scenes. In short, this film is unbearably athmospheric and has terrific special effects to boot. They make the film more effective, and that's a rare thing in a horror movie.The performances by the actors are superb. Carpenter regular Kurt Russell makes a solid hero and the rest do an impeccable job in varied roles.One of the best horror films ever, top 10 easily. Can't recommend it enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Terrifying but has a few flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's "The Thing" is my second favorite movie by him with the original "Halloween" being my favorite. The movie is filled with paranoia and isolation. The pace is a little slow sometime, but for the most part it moves effectively, starting at the beginning with a scene of nothing but white snow and mountains. After a moment you hear a helicopter and shooting, and suddenly a Husky comes into view, running from the people in the helicopter who are trying to kill it. I watched this movie when I was young, and seeing any kind of dog being shot at made me dislike the people in the helicopter. The dog runs to another base where he is immediately saved and the Norwegians in the helicopter meet there demise with the helicopter blowing up and one of them being shot between the eyes. I almost cheered at seeing this. However, not long after, the dog is found creeping around the base as if stalking, and suddenly alarm bells went off in my head. Something was definitely not right with this innocent looking dog, and I began to understand why those Norwegians might have been trying to kill it. Soon after we find out why, and suddenly all heck breaks loose because that innocent looking dog was really an imitation of something much worse. A thing from outer space that could imitate any living creature. I really don't have to say more, but this movie, which scared the crap out of me as a child, has some of the most gut wrenching and horrifying special effects ever. They still hold up well today and out do much of the CGI which now dominates films. Carpenter has once again shown how good he is at directing horror films, and Rob Bottin shows us more horrifying make-up effects then what he gave us in "The Howling." The sad thing though is I could never warm to any of the characters. MacCready, as played by Kurt Russel, was the only one I ever really cared about. The others were very cold, almost robotic. And the way they all seemed to go off so easily knowing that they could be imitated made them a little implausible as well. Other than that, I would put this movie in my top 15 horror films. It would be in top 5 easily if the characters had all been more interesting, but the 1982 version of "The Thing" is, in my opinion, still a better movie than the 1951 original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Thing" was the remake of the 1951 classic "The Thing From Another World". Being a John Carpenter fan to the tune of about a 7.5 stars a movie I have to give this production a bit more love?we will say 8 stars or so. The story might have been a stunner "back in the day" but to the modern movie fan it will come off like twenty or so other horror movies that have crossed the silver screen over the recent years?and about a hundred other that went straight to VHS or DVD. Despite that it holds in there with a nice little cast of B+ actors led by the B one day A the next actor Kurt Russell. Fear not movie fans Russell was on one of his A days for this one. The movie itself is a quality production and will do your widescreen, surround sound system proud when playing the collectors edition DVD. The movie certainly has a couple scenes that are classic for the horror fan and that alone makes it worth the time. I won't promise it will make you hide under your couch in fear but its special effects are nicely done and you might find yourself uttering an occasional "eeeuuuwww" or "Yuck".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thing is by far one of the best horror films ever made. This was a real horror film. It had little to no comedy to it and the roles were perfect for each actor. I can't stand the horror films today that have reduced the scare factor down to well, lets just make them jump a little but damn can we try to make them laugh. I HATE THIS. The Thing never does that. It went over if not broke barriers that never had existed in film. 1) all male crew and cast. 2) no happy ending. 3) Scary as hell. This is what a great horror film is to me. If you feel that I am wrong, please email me and tell me. But please tell me what horror film you thought was the best to you... in your opinion, because that is all this is... my opinion. j_edward71@yahoo.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror movies ... CLASSIC !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie would have to be in the top 250 best films of the history. It's the best carpenter movie that I have seen in my life. Yesterday I watched the assault of precinct 13 and I like a lot I enjoy very much with the idea: Direct a cop-movie with the style of horror movies.The carpenter thing is very different of the original "The Thing From Another World" 1951 version. The carpenter directs is better than directs of Christian Nyby.The characters of Carpenter Thing are very "enigmatic" &amp; the script are very atmospheric &amp; claustrophobic. The Rob Bottin make up it's one of the best make up in the movies history. The Ennio Morricone score it's unbelievable, simple and forceful.And the end of the movie it's very rewarding. It's and instant classic one of the best horror movies with Ridley Scott "Alien"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies if not my favorite. It has excellent special effects,but thats not why its so good, Its story uses paranoia ,suspense, fear, and gore to scare you.The special effects weren't computer animation, they were all robots, which gives it a more organic and real look. they used real flamethrowers and I think real dynamite.The movie's ending doesn't let you know if they make it or not, if they killed the thing, or if they are the things.there is a game that is supposed to be the sequel to the movie. I played it , it's a good game , but it doesn't do a good job of being a sequel to the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thing (1982)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 19 years old when i first saw this movie at the theater. To this day I still can't believe this movie did not get recognition it deserved when it first came out. I believe as people buy it at the stores they will really appreciate this flick. I thought it was a well thought out, and put together movie. In later years I never saw the movie on Pay per view or cable and it was just recently released on DVD. I rented this movie from a video store back in the late 1980s and watched it two or three times before I returned it. I just recently bought the DVD at Best Buy. In my personal opinion i think this was the best movie Kurt Russell ever made. This Sci/fi horror movie was very fast paced, and action oriented. If you are looking to rent a movie with Sci/fi, and horror you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't a slavish remake of the black and white original or an anal adaptation of Campbell's WHO GOES THERE? short story. It's John Carpenter stamping his own brand of balls-to-the-wall film-making on a fascinating premise and it works beautifully.Carpenter doesn't compromise the material by sticking a love story in there and he doesn't sanitize the shock scenes. Ably assisted by the brilliant master of special make-up Rob Bottin, he creates one of the very best Hollywood-financed sci-fi movies ever.Ennio Morricone's brooding, minimalist score keeps the tension pumped and the all-male cast keeps the expected thespian histrionics under control.This is not a pacey film. Carpenter allows it to seep into our psyches and fill us with dread before he pulls some jaw-dropping rabbits from his hat.The film flopped upon its theatrical release while the friendly alien (ET: THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL) in the theatre next door took box office line honors. Both films have stood the test of time for their own reasons.Lensing by Dean Cundey is stand-out and lead Kurt Russell carries the film well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spellbinding story of isolation, distrust, and fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last night I watched John Carpenter's version of "The Thing" for the first time. It was very good. Gore and scenes of suffering repel me, so I was reluctant to watch it. But I wanted to compare Carpenter's work to the 1951 movie, which I had seen earlier this year (and found much less satisfying).The main themes of the 1982 movie were isolation, fear, distrust, hopelessness, and bafflement, and how these emotions affect otherwise stable human beings. People change from being "scientific" to being undisciplined from fear. A feeling of doom steadily grows. As for the gory scenes, they are much less frequent than some reviews would have you believe. However, they are horrific (I had to look away once, and I'm 57). The special effects were a tribute to the human imagination: what causes a person to conceive of a head's stretching from its torso, falling off of an examination table (to avoid being burned up by a flame-thrower), and sending out tentacles that lash onto objects and pull itself across the floor? Other effects were equally creative. Some aspects of the "Thing" reminded me of the creature in "Alien." The opening scene, involving the hunting of a dog by men in a helicopter, was troubling for me because I hate to see animals suffer. To me a dog that is being hunted is suffering (from fear). Once I overcame my bad feelings about the scene, I gave some thought to its details, and I became puzzled. It should have been fairly easy for the men in the helicopter to kill the dog, so why were they unable to do so? They had a machine that could fly much faster than any dog could run, and flew a zigzag path to repeatedly take aim at the fleeing animal. But no bullet from the rifle hit the dog. Later it became clear: shortly before the hunt, the men in the chopper had seen their comrades---at another scientific outpost---perish in a most gruesome manner. Those scenes of death, and the experiences that led up to them, undoubtedly made these men almost insane with fear and desperation. No wonder the pilot flew erratically and the gunner never hit the dog! I have two complaints: staffing and armaments. The staffing of the research station was implausible. Some characters seemed to be too casual or unprofessional to have been stationed at a scientific outpost, where---I assume---only the cream of the crop are sent in order to get the "biggest bang from the buck." Yeah, scientists are people too, and the outposts in Antarctica surely have social problems. I just think that people at remote science stations are more serious, more mature, and have more to do than some characters depicted here. And so few people at a station? Survival in the extreme winter conditions would seem to require a bigger outpost and many more people: cooks, medical team, maintenance people, etc.The other weakness was the presence of the armaments and flame-throwers. Since the station's mission was never explained, I was forced to assume that these things were necessary. But I don't like that type of story-telling. If there are devices present that would seem out of place to the average person, the story-tellers have an obligation to explain the situation. Was an "explaining" scene deleted during the editing process, or was this a case of lazy writing? Some commenters have theorized that flame-throwers are used to melt snow, but that's unlikely. As I understand it, flame-throwers are not merely super hair dryers with flames, but squirt guns that propel a napalm-like substance onto things. That burning medium would be all over anything that had been sprayed---not a nice residue to leave in the snow. Aside from the staffing and armaments themes, I could believe the movie. Maybe I need to go back to school and take a remedial course in "Management of Small Scientific Stations in Ice-bound Environments." On the plus side, as others have mentioned, there were not any extraneous elements such as romance or earthquakes to keep viewers interested. (Aside from the fact that there were no women in the movie, romance would have been laughably out of place here---when people experience an increasing state of terror, they aren't likely to linger in the lab to kiss.) The development of suspense, based on the disintegration of trust among the characters, kept me spellbound. The soundtrack helped sustain a creepy, foreboding atmosphere; I don't care who created or manipulated it. Partially filmed in or near Stewart, British Columbia---get out the atlas! For a guy who hates scenes depicting horror or bad things happening to animals, I liked this movie. It was much, much better than the 1951 version, not because of the special effects, which were excellent, but because of the development of suspense and the style of acting. After reading so much praise for the DVD version of this movie, I just might rent it.Forty-four pages of comments!---impressive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's The Thing is an intelligent and well made horror/thriller with Kurt Russel leading an absolutely fantastic ensemble cast. The characterization in this movie is critical because of all the paranoia and suspense between the actors. For anyone who thinks that special effects could not be done well before the advent of CGI I beg you to watch this movie. Rob Bottin really outdid himself on the designs for the Thing, which in essence could really look like anything that he could imagine since it has no "true" form, at least not in the movie. The pacing of the movie is absolutely perfect and really causes the viewer to question who is who. This is one of the most suspenseful, claustrophobic and thrilling movies of all time. It's a shame that it didn't perform well at the box office (in part because it was released during the "summer of E.T.") since I would really like to see more the alien's backstory and origins in a possible sequel or prequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Modern Sci Fi Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taut,atmospheric and superbly crafted, this remake of the 50's classic is a great film in it's own right. Arguably John Carpenters best movie. The Thing is also an absolute bench mark for incredible creature effects by Rob Bottin. No CGI back in '82, which makes the Thing all the more impressive as it's withstood the test of time magnificently. The design and execution of the monster effects are hideous.mind boggling and darkly humorous. Carpenters typically creeping camera work (in beautiful anamorphic widescreen) sucks you in and tantalises you, as does Ennio Morricone's pulsing score.Kurt Russell is charismatic as ever and the rest of the cast do terrific work. Ironically when released in '82, The Thing tanked mightily, got critically crucified for gross out effects and it's gallows atmoshpere. But it's important to remember that this was the summer of E.T and audiences weren't in the mood for this horrific paranoia thriller. In 82 the Thing was seen as gratuitous. In reality 'The Thing' was way ahead of it's time.Now it can be admired for the terrific movie it is, showing the kind of suspense and creativity which seems to have deserted most big budget sci-fi and horror films these days.The Universal Collectors DVD is the only way to discover this woefully under-appreciated movie. So grab some popcorn, turn down the lights, crank up the sub woofer, you wont be disappointed</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gory remake of the 1951 classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen many John Carpenter films and this one is the best for Carpenter. Aside from the obvious flaws in this film, It's not a bad remake of "The Thing From Another World". The special effects are the only thing worth watching. As far as the characters are concerned, they are so stupid. I mean that they are supposed to be intelligent scientists, but act like a bunch of alcoholic, drug addicted morans who have no clue what they are doing or where they are. I would have expected that Carpenter have more insight into his characters. On a scale of 1 to 10, I rate it at 4.5 Look for Kurt Russell in his best acting job since "The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes" (1970). If you have a weak stomach, don't watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How do I tell someone what a classic is... how do I saw "it was the scariest movie of its time"... There have been remakes, advances in SFX, and how annoying is it (Im 30) to run across someone who just saw the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and NOT KNOW that its a remake. I wont even go into the Manchurian Candidate story. Luckily, we have The Thing. The special FX are EPIC...EPIC!!! Timeless. You have the ultimate not only in Hitchcockian horror (the unseen being scarier than what is actually showm), but blinding horror in the shape of what IS seen. A tough mix. AND... what makes this movie epic on all fronts...the storyline, and the main, central plot... the relationships between characters. Not just fodder, or characters that exist just to get the body count... but a very scary game of CLUE..hehe... in which nobody trusts anyone. Sci-Fi fans jump on in too. This is the nightmare passenger on ANY flight.WOW. By the way, after writing this, I'm putting this movie in. Do it right, people. Turn out the lights, let your guard down, unplug the phone, and prepare to be disturbed. This is THE THING.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>80's movies and time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To see this movie in this day and age, most think that "The Thing" is a horrible movie. I myself believe quite the opposite. We should relic the movies before computer generated animation. Movies like "The Thing" and "Alien" or even "Killer Klowns from Outer space". Each of those movies, while they may not be the most popular movies, is a relic and a tribute to times when a monster required work and time outside a computer screen. Sure there is a small amount of computer help in "The thing" but the monster and all the scenes in that movie are genuine in the fact that a real place was involved in either the in studio filming or the on location shots. Lets not think of this movie as old and outdated, lets think of it as a true horror movie that was designed to scare you not to make you ooh and ahh at the monster (Even though the monster in "The Thing" is one of the best movie monsters ever both visually and in pure horror</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No doubt one of the best horror movies ever made. The special effects are so mind-blowing that one can almost not believe it. This is made before computer graphics, so one becomes aware of the artistic genius behind the special effects. I saw this as a child. It is super cool. A real 80s movie. Later I found out the H.P.Lovecraftian spawning of the movie. Anyway, it's great. Watch it! All sci-fi and horror fans should see this movie, and despair! Only thing I found a bit weird was the beginning with the spaceship that is flying to Earth. Perhaps that is a bit too much, since this is a monster-movie more than anything else. Moreover, one has a feeling that it is a present-day Earth, so it doesn't fit in with the plot of the UFO having landed a long time ago. Anyway, despite "goofs" and "mistakes" this movie is on my top 10 of favorite movies. Of course, the reason for this is also the excellent acting and dialog, such as great lines like: "Maybe we are at war with Norway!" All things considered, this is a great movie which can be seen again and again. There is so much detail in the characters, plot and effects. Moreover, it is shot in a beautiful location in Alaska. The DVD also contains some very good extra-material.</fullReview>

Mostly because the film is so good and it flows along very well.In the scenes where Clark finds something weird going on in the dog pen and brings all the others back, they all watch as the things stretches long clawed arms upwards, punches a hole in the ceiling and escapes and then they burn what was left in the pen.Then the movie continues with NO ONE remembering that part of it escaped from the dog pen.So where are those scenes????</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing the remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers and thought that was pretty creepy. This however made me excited when somebody turned out to be The Thing. It was great when Sci Fi decided to air the movie in order to promote the video game (which is equally as cool). I also enjoyed how there were no women in the feature mainly because it meant no love story would be included. This is one of those few movies where you wouldn't want a thing like love to slow a character down. Also I doubt they wouldn't be trusted just like any other person, which means there couldn't be a love story. One of my favorite parts is in the beginning where the Swedish guy throws the grenade and goes after it. Childs would have to be my favorite character just because of his attitude. I also enjoyed Keith David in John Carpenter's They Live.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Formally perfect scary movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Carpenter's few true masterpieces. Reviled by critics at the time of its release, it's built a healthy cult following since then, but still suffers from a reputation as the ne plus ultra of alien splatter movies. It's a reputation that is both deserved and unfair--Rob Bottin's effects are certainly repulsive and shocking, even by today's standards, but they are few and far between, and that's actually what makes the movie so scary. 'The Thing' is a study in contrasts--long segments of unsettling quiet punctuated by sudden, brief blasts of grotesque horror. It's an approach that works beautifully--in fact, this may be the paranoid horror movie to end all paranoid horror movies, surpassing the superficially similar 'Alien' and even 'Night of the Living Dead' in its style and polish (if not its substance). The large cast of character actors is uniformly superb, with Wilford Brimley, Keith David, and Donald Moffat perhaps standing out. Bill Lancaster's screenplay is economical and convincing, resisting the urge to stereotype its characters or over-inflate its dialogue. While 'The Thing' is known for its humorlessness, to my ear the script plays like the bleakest and subtlest of black comedies, with its unexpected doses of hideous death, and its terrified, bickering scientists never managing to pull themselves together and solve anything. The lighting and slithery cinematography are magnificent, even for this director, and Ennio Morricone's score seems to be a conscious, clever imitation of Carpenter's own minimalist compositions. If pressed, I might complain that in this (as in most of his other films) Carpenter is too much of an aesthete, more interested in exercising his formal gifts than in saying anything. At the same time, I don't much care--Carpenter's rare dips into social commentary have been rather heavy-handed (see 'They Live' - just kidding, don't), and a perfectly scary film is still a perfectly scary film, deeper meaning or no. Enjoy. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful over-the-top gorefest -</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, this is not exactly a remake of Hawk's 'The Thing (from Another World)'. There are only glancing similarities. Most every reviewer has pointed this out and now so have I. But that makes it far from disappointing. It starts right into the action and tosses a mystery in your face. Before you get a chance to ponder too long the fit hits the shan. I love this movie. It is so nightmarish, grotesque, and at times hideous. The special effects are stomach churning every time - and fascinating - almost beautiful. And yet it isn't necessarily a 'gross-out'. There's plenty of blood and ooze to last a couple of sequels - it's just the nature of this beast - whatever it is. The movie keeps you tensed and eventually resolves to a logical ending. Then I wonder why a sequel was never made? Now I understand this didn't exactly pack them in at the box-office. It's just as well. It would have been hard to equal this in a sequel.The acting is exact and convincing. Russell is, well, as you've seen him before and since. But he does it well. No-one really stands out, but everyone is competent and the character development works so well you don't even notice it happening. The background music is taut. Perfect.The real show stopper is the special effects. For maximum effect - beware. Many cable channels will show this movie but they always cut it. When they do this they take away some of the more interesting effects. Yes, they are intense and disturbing - but that is the whole point - innit? That is why this one is a 'keeper' in my library. Great Halloween night flick! Just maybe not for the feeble or green, if you know what I mean?I have viewed this multiple times and still find it worthy. I find myself even trying to determine who 'caught it' when by nuances in the acting. You never know. I kind of identify with Brimley's character. I would get real confused and paranoid too. Or was that just an act to get left alone to work some things out? Hmm?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter takes horror to a new level by thrusting the viewer into the bleak, frigid expanse of the Antarctic, where an American expeditionary research team encounters the unexpected.... a rescue of a sled dog pursued by a pair of Norwegian paramilitary types from their camp miles away. In so doing, the Americans unwittingly provide a safe harbor for what turns out to be a hideous alien creature capable of assuming any life form in close proximity to it- in this case, the Husky.Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley and Richard Dysart head a cast of scientists, and support personnel who are yanked out of their sheer daily boredom and cabin fever to confront the Thing.Problem is,WHO is the Thing, and WHO is the genuine human? A bitter battle for survival ensues,complete with the dark paranoia and exhaustion caused by each of the men not trusting each other.Carpenter follows John Campbell Jr.'s short story, "Who Goes There?" far more closely than Howard Hawks did in the original 1951 release. By doing so, Carpenter was allowed to capitalize on 1982 special effects in order to portray the alien at its goriest splendor. Rob Bottin's latex and mechanical effects are superb, and will still evoke a sense of disgust from even the more seasoned horror movie buff.The sense of distrust, vulnerability and anxiety mounts among the research staff as they try to figure out how to bring this perfect imitator out into the open... before they are all consumed by It.Definitely graphic. Definitely claustrophobic. Definitely one of Carpenter's best films. It will leave you trembling in your bed at night, whispering, "who goes there?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can you believe that, when this movie was originally released, audiences despised it? An 80s remake of The Thing could very easily be a rehash of Cold War nostalgia- there's still something of a pretext about it- but the setting and effects employed here make it a horror classic. The stop-motion animation, instead of feeling dated and tired, has a more visceral impact than computer-generated FX, and the entire film is loaded with tension. And Carpenter doesn't let the movie fall back on cheap gore either: several scenes are just good, old-fashioned scary as hell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really loved this film so much The Thing is the best horror film that john carpenter has done along with Halloween and The Fog. Not going to say alot about the plot in case people have not seen the film yet but let me say this is just about the best horror paranoia film you can ever get in movie history. The special effect are so good it holds up todays speical effect even better and that was done in 1982. John Carpenter films today are not very good vampire and ghost of mars was rubbish and wish he goes back to his roots.Give this film 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily one of the best horror movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter used to be a great director and this is an example of that. He's done one really good movie in 10 years and that's "In the Mouth of Madness." For some reason he's gone away from what he does best and chooses to do horrible big budget horror movies like"Vampires" and "Ghosts from Mars." This is a classic horror movie and better than the 1951 original. Kurt Russell is excellent and so is the rest of the ensemble cast. Paranoia is the best way to make a horror movie work. Movies like Session 9 don't even need a budget because they work so well with human nature and how it takes very little for man to turn on his friends. This is a must see for any horror fan or even Sci Fi fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite possibly the finest movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm totally serious, this is a work of art. The setting, acting, plot everything is TERRIFIC. Top notch psychological thriller. I love this movie so much it was one of the first DVD's I bought. Hell I bought a DVD player just so I could buy this movie on DVD. This movie is up there with the original Star Wars in terms of my devoted reverence.What makes this movie so great? It's the feeling of helplessness so far away from any sort of rescue. It's the complete unknown. It's watching in grim fascination how this group dynamic completely becomes unhinged. When the monster first appears it is so GODDAMN frightening that you are just awestruck, along with the rest of the all male cast. It's that surreal theme of just a single repeated note.... It's the way the ending is left completely ambigious, something Hollywood seems to have forgotten how to do. Remember Contact? Why have "we have 17 hours of footage" comment at the end instead of leaving it ambigious, promoting eternal wonderment and use of your imagination to decide for yourself how it all turned out. The Thing is a wonderful, terrifying, utterly captivating what-if social experiment that far transends it's b movie, horror/sci-fi categorization. In fact in that category it is it's Star Wars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great horror overlooked in its time. Now more revered than ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a remake of the 50's version as commonly thought, but a far closer adaptation of the literary source, "Who Goes There?" by John W Campbell Jr.The Antarctic. Isolation, mistrust, horror. Kurt Russell, a chopper pilot, takes the lead in a group of a dozen men at a meteorological research outpost in dire straits. In a gruesome and vain struggle, they try root out the bizarre alien lifeform they unwittingly gave refuge; one that can "assimilate" and convincingly impersonate anything it kills.A box office weakling during the original release, The Thing has stood the test of time. It was obviously the underdog beneath the huge shadow of ET- no doubt politically incorrect among critics, being a hideous evil alien during a love affair period with friendly little lovey huggy aliens. (also check out X-tro, an offbeat British flavored rebellion against the sweet lil' alien phenomenon of the time).The Thing has returned in a collectors edition DVD (darn I gotta get it), spawned comic series, and the recent video game. I think this film has gone beyond a small cult following, and is much more appreciated nowadays, over 20 years later, than in '82. Like wine, it has virtually improved with age, showing us decent horror and pre-CGI special effects that surpass most of what is (laughably) called horror and special effects today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror films ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first watched this film I was sixteen years old. I was at the time (I still am!) a huge fan of Carpenters work and had seen films like "Halloween" or "In The Mouth Of Madness" and many more, but unfortunately "The Thing" wasn't available on DVD in Germany. So I bought it via the Internet. When I watched for the first time I had many friends around me, we used to watch movies at least once a week, mainly horror. When the film started it got dead silent and everybody was fully concentrated to figure out who was the one creating all that havoc (of course no one did with succes!)The film itself is highly tense and manages to make you sweat! The superb directing of John Carpenter, the great performances of Kurt Russel and his co-stars, the eye-catching special effects (all hand made, no CGI!), the music (Carpenter himself) and the new approach to an old topic makes this film most definetly to one of the best horror films. Who could ever forget scenes like the "blood test scene"? Or the beginning with the dog? These scenes can be remembered forever, just like the shower scene from "Psycho"! But I must warn you: Don't ever watch this film alone! It'll make you turn into something different! 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably Carpenter's best work.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally seen as the true masterpiece it has always been, John Carpenter's 1982 sci fi / horror classic The Thing is a must for all the director's followers. Unlike Carpenter's usual efforts The Thing is one of his few films that is not rooted in the Western genre. It is however the opening part for his 'Apocalypse Trilogy' that continued with Prince of Darkness (1987)and concluded with In the Mouth of Madness (1995).The Thing is a retelling of the story 'Who Goes There?' (1938) written by John W Campbell Jr. and made previously in 1958 by Christian Nyby as The Thing From Another World. The story concerns a group of men isolated and forced to defend themselves against a shape shifting alien species. High tension, great performances, chilling score from Morricone and some dazzling camera work from Dean Cundey. The star of the show is undoubtedly special effects maestro Rob Bottin, with what is still considered today to be jaw-droppingly shocking make up effects.The DVD is worth purchasing. Full of extras and commentaries with Carpenter and Russell are always entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest horror/sci fi film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is hands down the greatest horror/sci fi movie of all time. I'm not biase anyway in this decision considering John Carpenter is my favorite director of all time, because this movie led me to believe he is the greatest director out there. I remember seeing this movie for the first time a long time ago on A &amp; E, of course it was edited for television but I was hooked on it. It took me 5 years after that to get around to actually renting it, and it was greater than before. I don't think I'm alone when I say that 90 % of all horror movies today suck ass, because it is true, and sorry to say thats in no way opinionated.For 1982, this movie really did break a lot of boundaries. Now I'm not saying Alien was a bad movie, I liked it, but The Thing kicks the Alien's ass. I mean, the alien in Alien was so crappily made, it seemed to float, and you never saw it actually walking, and the suit the guy wore was obviously too obstuse and mechanically mediocre, hence the alien moving along sluggishly at the speed of life. At least with the Thing, you had something original, which was something that could be just about anything. Whether it was a spider, a crab, a walking head with snail eyes growing out of it, the Thing was virtuous and worked things out in an incognito manner. Whereas Alien seemed terribly drab and bleak, the Thing was explosively original. Now I'm not too big of a fan of Rob Bottin's work, but this movie really showcased his ability to make some freaky stuff. I always saw Rob Bottin as the poor man's Rick Baker, but with this movie, he's right up there with him without a doubt, no lower.Other great aspects of this movie are the lighting and music. I loved the dark and light shades of blue that illuminated the set, especially the lights outside and color of the windows at nighttime. The music was cool too, but I really only liked the John Carpenter music, because a classical Ennio Morricone score just doesn't fit a Carpenter movie, considering he has been credited as scoring all of his films, with the exception of this, Starman, and Memoirs Of An Invisible Man. Only Carpenter's electronic realization of the score brings the oddity and isolation of the film.The Thing is a movie that any true horror fan will appreciate. If you see anything wrong with this movie, then I feel sorry for you, because you probably pertain to the crappy demented slasher movies, by the way which all spawned from Halloween, another Carpenter classic. I'm sorry, I just couldn't ask for anymore, and the several thousand people out there that see this underrated movie as a classic, I have to admire you all, I really do, you all have my gratitude and accompanying salute as people who truly know what a great cinematic piece of work is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At the apex of its genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's truly hard to find a horror feature that so cleary disgusts the viewer to a point the story becomes difficult to absorb and analyze as food for thought. When faced with physical and emotional trauma most people, in general, desire some sort of closure to relieve the tensions of a traumatic event, but these unfortunate characters can only slog through a desperate situation that gets worse with each scene. John Carpenter's exploitation of this vuneralbility forces such a burden on the viewer that a full understanding of the story's dialogue and action can not be grasped in a single viewing. Some of us have to experience "The Thing" a number of times in order to come to terms with the multitude of questions one is left with in the wake of such intense emotional stress. Personally, I have seen this film many times over the years, never tiring from the repetition. I just finished watching the DVD Collector's Edition and still come away with the same nagging question. SPOILER FROM HERE OUT How has MacReady and Childs managed to avoid infection? In the director's commentary John Carpenter leaves the question unanswered while suggesting that each of the viewers must decide for themselves the true meaning of the final scene. My brother says, and I agree, that it's because of MacReady's abuse of alcohol(which is made very apparent), and a possible link to Child's suffering from a blood disease (ie, sickle-sell anemia) that keeps the thing from infecting the two of them. I know, fanciful speculation, and that's my point; there can be no closure for the viewer. Like the characters in the the story, one could lose sleep trying to wrestle with the pressure related to the paronoia and fear generated by not knowing the answers they seek. In the future I will continue to revisit this movie and allow it to do for me what good art should.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still the real thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Warning contains plot and last scene spoilers*John Carpenter's The Thing still sticks in my mind as one of the most frightening and disturbing films I've ever seen. I first saw this on video as a teenager, although I do remember the original trailer on TV and thinking 'I wish I could watch adult films!'. -It scared the cr*p out of me!The story itself (from a 1930s sci-fi novella) is a fantastic idea alone. An alien creature that can assume the identity of any organism it 'comes into contact with' (this is a very mild expression next to the slime-fest we're exposed to in the film!). Not only that, but it can assume the form of any, part of, or all the things it has *previously* come into contact with.. And this Thing has been around! We know this as it arrives via Flying-saucer-in-trouble some time before the dawn of mankind. This is shown right before the titles giving this film one of the most memorable intros I've seen (to match the memorable ending - see below).Thus we are given arguably the best monster to ever appear on celluloid.This film will be compared to 'Alien' a lot simply because the premise is similar (close-knit group of vulnerable people in claustrophobic prison-like environment, locked in with unknown man-killer) and they were released at a similar time. BUT the *big* difference you have to recognise between the two monsters is that The Thing can look like anything and therefore you don't know who the monster is, and Alien was ultimately, a bloke-in-a-suit which has been done since the dawn of cinema!Now we have established why the monster is so good in concept, you have to go on to talk about Rob Bottin's gruesome realisation of the monster. These have to be amongst the most violent and disturbing creature effects ever made, along with possibly the original Evil Dead, An American Werewolf In London and, of course, Aliens.This guy was 20 when he started his work on The Thing. Yes *20 years old*. Obviously he's read a lot of sci fi and comic books, and the excellent DVD will tell you he worked on The Howling before this movie, so knew his stuff where latex and goo was concerned. This guy helped to create one of the most memorable movie scenes ever made (the infamous resuscitation scene). His effects are a work of genius and even the filmmakers had doubts he could pull some of it off. To my mind this stuff is more difficult and gives better results than the modern CG equivalent. One of his creations was described as 'beautiful' and 'a work of art' by cast and crew. Those images will stick in your minds forever once you have seen this movie, I guarantee it! Even after watching the DVD extras you have to marvel at what they pulled off and how it was accomplished.Rob worked so hard on this movie he was sent to hospital for nervous exhaustion after working 18 hrs a day, 7-days a week for months. That's when the second-unit effects team were called in to do some of the kennel scene - led by Mr Terminator himself, Stan Winston.Next mention goes to Kurt Russel. Personally this is my favourite Kurt film and to be honest, one of a very few genuinely good films he's been in. His understated Macready character is immensely watchable, and more importantly believable, as the alcoholic ex-Nam copter pilot who is forced into becoming the reluctant leader. Whenever I hear the name Kurt Russel now I always think of this bearded character standing in the snow with a flamethrower and a squashed mexican sombrero!Next we have the rest of the cast who do a great job of getting across the potential flashpoint mix of all-male characters. Yes there are no women in this movie and in my mind it's better for it. So we have this initially confined group (who never seem to do any work!) tolerating but knowing very well each other's habits, becoming an intensely paranoid and potentially murderous bunch of frightened men looking to their leader to deal with this Thing. This changeover from friends to enemies happens over the course of one maybe two scenes and so becomes great cinema, without the monster.Next the sound and music. For some reason Carpenter mentions Ennio Morricone's music once in the DVD extras, and does not mention the sound effects at all! Russel actually asks him in the Director's Commentary how they got a certain sound and Carpenter laughs the question off with 'who knows'. Shame on you John Carpenter! For the sound effects are some of the most disturbing I've heard in a movie, especially when the dogs are suffering, and also at the conclusion of the blood test scene. The violence that comes across in this scene is carried 50% in the screaming of the men, the smashing furniture, the coughing of the broken flamethrower ('Windows, blast him!!') and the horrible gurgling of the Thing itself.I am still confused as to how much of the main musical score in the film is John Carpenter and how much is Mr Morricone. It certainly sounds more Carpenter than Morricone, with that trademark simple sinister baseline and dread-inspiring chords. Whoever it is the soundtrack is also extremely fitting and memorable, right from the first credits.Mention has to go also to the set designers and builders who create this incredibly realistic environment, perfect for the story, in snow-covered British Columbia. They built it in summer when there was no snow so that by the time it came to filming it would look as real as possible. Much of the internal shots were done in refrigerated sets in a very hot LA summer. I still wonder how much research was done into, er, research posts - especially with regard to the amount of firepower they store in the film! - racks of shotguns and 2 flamethrowers!! Maybe those copters take a little more defrosting in the mornings than most ;) Anyway we worry about the details after the film because the flamethrowers are such an integral part of the action and fire is the only method our victims know of killing this Thing.Last mention to Carpenter himself who does a great job of realising the vision of the original story, bringing some great performances out of the actors who didn't have a lot to work with, and giving us one of the most memorable endings to a movie: the last 2 survivors sit in the burning wreckage of the base, exchange a bottle of whisky, knowing they eventually will either freeze or be eaten by their colleague and Macready says 'lets just see what happens..' Fade to black. Fantastic stuff!So, 20 years on, a lot of sci-fi, monsters and computer graphics have passed us by but The Thing still lives on as a very disturbing but believable take on the alien takes you over nightmare. I had very real nightmares for years which were a cross between this version of The Thing and the 70s version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Perhaps Kurt Russel, Rob Bottin and John Carpenter's finest hours. Buy the Collector's DVD!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute genre classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to wonder what went wrong with John Carpenter. While nowadays he is just creature feature director (and a poor one at that), back in 1982 he created not just the greatest sci-fi monster movie ever, but one of the most exquisitely crafted films of any genre.The camera work, understated performances, sound editing, score, set design and wonderful matt backgrounds (that you won't even no were there were it not for the DVD extras) are as good as you will find anywhere. All of these elements combined to create one of the most believable environments in cinema history. When watching this film you can almost feel the arctic cold.Then of course there is Rob Bottins effects work. Whereas similar effects heavy films from the same period such as Ghostbusters and the Terminator now look quaint, the Thing still convinces as a nasty organic tendril sprouting entity. There is no comfortable CGI to reassure you that this is 'just a film'. The effects on display here interact seamlessly with their human co-stars, leaving you in no doubt that the characters are in very real peril. The cast, including a young Keith David and the ever reliable Kurt Russell as the taciturn MacReady, are uniformly excellent. There is not one moment that you are in any doubt that these men are in the freezing cold middle of no-where without actually wanting to be there. Also worthy of a mention are the dogs. The canines in this film produce better performance than most of the human cast of the Star Wars films!###SLIGHT SPOILER### The film also features one of the great 'what's going to happen next?' endings, with the survivors stranded without food or shelter, but seemingly having accomplished their revised mission to vanquish the Thing. However if you look closely one of the men's breath cannot be seen, which is an odd thing in sub-zero temperatures. Maybe this is by design, maybe it's an editing mistake, or maybe it's just me. But if one of the survivors is the Thing what is to stop it finishing of the remainder of the survivors and going back into hibernation, waiting to be 'rescued' by the people sent to rescue MacReady &amp; co?With this and Halloween Carpenter created two of the absolute best films in the Sci-Fi and horror genres. It is high time that this one-time master crafts men was acknowledged as a film-making great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently obtained the Collector's Edition DVD after having seen this film in theaters and countless times on VHS. Still one of the best in the thriller/horror/SCI-FI genre, not quite as good as it's predecessor ALIEN but very close.The paranoia of the hapless research station staff is palpable. Enhanced by the claustrophobic surroundings of the station buildings and inclement polar weather outside. And in 1982 if the director wanted a special effect they actually had to BUILD it. No CGI here. To my mind the effects hold up well considering it was 2 decades ago. Thankfully a second-rate sequel was never made, preserving the impact of the thought provoking ending.THE THING is a classic. I recommend the DVD - wide screen being the only way to view John Carpenter's vision. An updated "making of" documentary with cast/crew recollections is also quite interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1951 Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby made a wonderful science fiction film called The Thing From Another World(known to many simply as The Thing.) This film served as the impetus for horror director John Carpenter to make a remake. Carpenter makes the film his own, however, and rather than a remake we really have a completely different film with like elements. Whereas the first film focusses its main attentions to the division between science and military, Carpenter's film is more of a gory mystery to see who is the alien being inside. There are plenty of reviews here going into great detail about the story, etc... All I will add is that Carpenter's film is stylish, scary, well-acted by a veritable who's who of character actors like Richard Dysart, Wilfred Brimley, and many others, aided by a nice performance by Kurt Russell, and has state of the art special effects. I was mesmerized from beginning to end, and found watching the film a thoroughly entertaining time. I am always grateful to people like John Carpenter for sharing their joy and enthusiasm for the horror and science fiction genre and paying tribute to it in their own special way. A first-rate scare!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not seen a movie in a long time that effected me the way The Thing did. it gets under your skin, slowly at first, and it eats you up inside. it can literally transform you into a nervous wreck.I could only watch the (horrifically violent) scenes in which The Thing actually appears comfortably. this should tell you something of the atmosphere of the rest of the film.John Carpenter's apocolypic masterpeice opens with a scene that is so incredibly simple but nearly unbearingly unnerving. a dog bounds across a snowy tundra, with a helicopter full of crazed Norweigans in close pursuit. the soundtrack, a simple, rythmic creation throbs heavily in the background. this soundtrack is not heard often in the film; not a single scene is scored in any traditional way. it's rythmic pulse insinuates a heartbeat.for a cast of 12 characters, all of them are balanced and, more importantly, all of them are validly suspect. I still am not sure as to weather or not Kurt Russel (who amazes here) was a thing or not. the film is abigous; it ends on that same note; and along the way it's a roller coaster so terrifying it makes Carpenter's other best work - Halloween - look tame by comparison.Rob Bottin's surreallistic creature effects are shown very little; they probably only dominate less than a quater of the screen time and are used very effectivley. all of the effects are the old-fashioned, mechanical-puppet variety, and yet each and every one is so convincing and realistic that they, themselves become fearsome. add that to a deeply, profoundly effecting excercise in what I can only define as psychological tourture and you have a modern science fiction classic. I cannot find a single thing wrong with this film, and trust me, I've tried. just a warning beforehand:if you should choose to see this movie, know as little about it beforehand as possible and be perpared: this film hits you, and it hits you HARD, and it doesn't stop. this is as effective, smart, errie, and terrifying a film as you'll find anywhere in any genre.and they say horror isn't an art. it is, ladies and gentlemen, and this film is proof of it. regarded by critcs and fans alike to be a modern classic of every kind, don't miss John Carpenter's Science-Fiction-Horror masterpeice.man is the warmest place to hide....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never liked the first version of "The Thing." It didn't follow the short story (which a great many science fiction fans believe is the best SF short story ever written). The monster's makeup was awful, as was typical for a 1950's horror film, and the characterizations were stereotypical. The John Carpenter version fixes all of these problems. With the exception of the ending, it is very close to the original story. The special effects are excellent, and the characterizations (or at least the fear they exhibit) seemed realistic to me. The only flaw was the ending, which IMHO made no sense whatever. Happily, one can still enjoy the movie even with the ending. I've watched it several times and still find it a good flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's not much to say about this movie that hasn't already been said, but i've watched this movie literally dozens of times over the past few years and it keeps getting better. All that can be said is it wears well with the time, unlike all the crappy horror movies they keep making today. Definitely the best movie Kurt Russell and Wilford Brimley have been in, and it features another great performance from Keith David, a truly underrated supporting actor. All the actors work well together, adding the tension needed to push the story over the top. Carpenter has made some other classics (Halloween, They Live, Christine, etc.), but this is his best. Just find someplace warm to hide, and trust no one (except this review of course)...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paranoia...a perfect way to bring fear to a perfect movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*May Contain Spoilers* Terrifying, creepy, excellent, beautiful. All of these words describe The Thing, John Carpenter's best work to date. I'm not sure how, but the people behind this film sure know how to set a mood of believable paranoia! It's like, ya' never know who the thing is until WHAM!, a guy's head splits open or a dog's head drops off, leaving a huge tongue. The F/X do not disappoint, of course, and Kurt Russel's performance as the brave but yet moderately paranoid hero brings fear in itself. Watch it in the dark and see if you ever sleep again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will never forget this as the suspense and the sheer horror makes this a great film.The plot is about researchers in Antarctica that discover a Swedish base that was burned to the ground. They obtain a friendly dog that turns out to be their worst nightmare.I enjoy John Carpenters direction. He makes you feel very hopeless in the situation, and the characters have some decent development. The level of gore is high, with spectacular effects. I consider it the best of Carpenters work.Get this movie if you want to scare your girlfriend, and yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thing i feel is a bit over rated, i'm not saying it was a bad movie cause it wasn't bad but it wasn't all that good. i found the first 30 minutes very slow, it does pick up but The Thing never reaches it's full potential. Kurt Russell was great like always and John Carpenter also was great. it's cool how The Thing can get into the bodies of the people he kills it gives the movie suspense which was good in the final 40 minutes of the movie. like i said The Thing is not bad but not that good, but i would recomend it i give the The Thing 7/10, if you wanna see great films with Carpenter and Russell check out Escape From New York or Big Trouble In Little China</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is converged excellence!The light in the movie is either blue (the cold antarctic), red (burning torches and fire) or just plain mat colors (in between the cold antarctic and the fire) which really 'highlights' the atmosphere from scene to scene.The script allows for the classic 'a few humans cramped up in terror' setup and really separates the boys from the men during the course of the movie. The build up of suspense and character developments are well balanced. This is actually one of the last sci-fi horror movies that has true cinematic class without having to dwell on block-buster one-liners or cliches (at least not apparently).The casting for the movie is excellent. The different personalities truly mimic a small society (in despair) with the 'rationals' battling the 'emotionals'.The special effects are very realistic. The use of classical effects (as opposed to computer animations) give the movie a very natural 'dirty' look which blend in very well with the surroundings.The only Thing that can be hard to grasp is the plausibility of the mechanics of the Thing. I saw the movie back in 1985 for the first time. At this time the way the Thing worked was imaginable but lacked a frame-of-reference.Since this time the concept of nano-technology has become more and more common. So if you watch this movie nowadays and have previously read something about nano-technology then the concept of the Thing has true merits.And the state-of-mind of the Thing, with more or less the same determination whether it's in a state of individual blood-cells or in a state of one of it's victims is excellent.Better than the original. I'm glad the movie never had a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Splendidly daft sci-fi nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening scene where McCready pours booze into the chess game sets the dumb tone for the rest of the pic. As if he would casually destroy property like that when he's got so little to pass the time with. Ah, but little did we know.....It's hard to believe this notorious el floppo is nearly twenty years old now but it I remember it was rather fascinating at the time. And there was a memorably silly hat, too. The science is dumb. How can an organism imitate a life form exactly and still retain it's own original identity and intelligence? If the thing's cells have changed into a dog's, how can it suddenly change into one of a million different life forms from a million planets at a moments notice? Where are those cells stored after a perfect simulation? And if it is a perfect simulation it should die if it has a heart attack in human form, not keep going and changing. Blair trashes the radio room in a fit of pique shouting, "no dog makes it a hundred miles in this terrain. No, that thing wanted to be US!" But why couldn't the thing turn into a more weather resistant monster out of it's million life forms rather than trying to be a warm blooded mammal that freezes to death easily?Carpenter was once a master of suspense, but this film marked the turning point and is curiously flat at exploiting the possible tensions between the men. It looks like it had been a difficult and troubled shoot and the script does not help. My favourite cringe-making line: "Do you buy any of this Voodoo bulls**t, Blair?" For an intelligent creature, the thing's behaviour is baffling. If that shadow early on in the film when the dog is stalking the rooms was Norris and by his hair shape it looked like him, why didn't he take over McCready and Doc when they went off together on the second trip to the Norwegian camp? It was a perfect opportunity. Likewise, he is left alone with Chiles and Gary who are tied to a sofa and at his mercy. He could have taken them over through their faces without damaging their clothes like he did to Gary in the final scene in the boiler room. The others were outside in the snow so they wouldn't have heard the screams. Also, Norris was given the early opportunity to be the leader but inexplicably turned it down. It would have given the thing a perfect chance to divide and conquer. Other daft moments include Blair building a mini saucer out of chopper spare parts. As if. Also the stupid moment when a blood sample suddenly acquires a mouth and shrieks. The blood on the floor runs away squeaking like mice as if blood has 'brains' as well as vocal cords. The average Bugs Bunny cartoon has more credibility. And did you notice that at the climax in the boiler room, the thing shoots up through the floor and instead of instantly attacking McCready it just sits their showing off a few heads, allowing McCready time to blow it up? And they wonder why films bomb. Having an ending that makes the audience feel cheated doesn't help, they like to think all that effort wasn't in vain but I rather liked not knowing if one of them was the thing.Despite all that it's still goofy fun and Carpenter has that ability to tap into that unnerving satanic atmosphere of his. Anyway, if you hate this review you can always console yourself with these words:"Are you going to listen to Gary? I mean, he could be one of those things!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Released at the same time as ET this is a somewhat different kind of alien. A remake of an old (yet relatively) good B-Movie it was modified by John Carpenter, changing the setting to an isolated Antarctic research outpost and upping the tension significantly. A thawed out creature that can "assimilate" and turn into whatever it touches hacks its way through an all-male cast. This actually works well with lots of angry posturing when nobody knows who is who they say they are. Class acting from Kurt Russell (in another anti-hero role) supported by a great ensemble cast, who work well together, and opposite the very good special effects (by maestro Rob Bottin) that convey the oddness if the creature itself. Definitely one of Carpenter's best and highly recommended to sci-fi and horror fans alike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is clearly one of the best horror films that has ever been made. This movie excelled in acting, screenplay, sound, script, etc. There really was no weak point in this movie. When writing a horror film, the primary thing that sets apart the great horror films from "the rest" is the ability to capture true human fear. This movie does it. The worst fear known to all of humanity is to not know who or where your enemy is. This is what the movie is all about.For all fans of this movie, be sure to hunt down the X-Files 1st Season episode "Ice". This is a remake of "The Thing" and done extraordinarily well. This is available on VHS and DVD. Find it and buy it. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carpenters finest movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I regard this one as John Carpenters finest movie. It has been sad to see his decline in recent years. In the mouth of madness had its few moments, but The village of the damned was a worthless piece of s--t. Luckily one can always watch The Thing again, and it certainly a worthwhile experience - especially in widescreen. The surreal imagery hold up remarkably well - one of the best special-effects work ever in the history of horror-movies. Fine performances overall, the photography is outstanding, and one detail is very refreshing - the sparingly used music, Im sure many scenes would have been overscored, if it had been done today. The Thing itself is a wonderful creation, a movie-monster which never shows its true form, and leaves you guessing as to what shape it originally had. And I love the unsentimental ending.</fullReview>

Actually the special effects are A GRADE, with the film offering plenty of explosions, more than a modern day action film. FLAMETHROWERS, GUNS and FLARES add to further action.Kurt Russell is well cast as everybody's favourite hero, chopper pilot, Macready.I won't spoil it, I mean to tell you what the THING is, but the film is interesting and suspensful because there are MOLES at work.Who is one of the THING? Who is not one of the THING? Kept me guessing, and my guesses shifted from one character to another.I feel it is a different sort of ALIEN, it certainly isn't a RIP-OFF or anything. Even the Background Music is good , the theme song, DUH DUH....DUH DUH....DUH DUH....DUH DUH.... still plays over in my head.I wouldn't be surprised if this FILM was remade with modern day special effects, with KURT RUSSELL reprising his role as Macready.9/10.</fullReview>

Soon enough, they discover they have a shape shifter in there midst that can take on the form of who it pleases.The tension is brilliant in the fact that is really is hard to tell who exactly "The Thing" is?. This film will keep you behind your cushions until the final credits have faded away.I give this film a 9/10 because it is horror suspense at it's best, full of gore and a theme tune to send shivers down your spine, very nasty.</fullReview>

This leads into the classic "someone in this room is the alien" plot, which has about a half a dozen to a dozen grown men looking at each other suspiciously, ready to bash each others heads in if someone "looks" like the space alien. (This plot has been run into the ground by THE OUTER LIMITS...they do one of these every other week!)

		<shortDescription>Not only a good horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thing is Carpenter's best work right after "Halloween" (which is almost impossible to surpass). It was also the first film of J.C. which he did for a big studio and on a rather large budget. Contrary to other films Carpenter was given much more time to complete this masterpiece. What he achieved has since become a true classic in the horror genre even if it is quite different from most of the other films that were made in the 80s.The Thing is not just a normal horror film trying to scare the audience with cheap thrills but is also some kind of a psychological drama. Throughout the whole movie you can never be sure who to trust. The thing moves from body to body imitating the victims perfectly and that's why anybody among the men could be possessed. The theme of paranoia and mistrust is very strong in this film and cleverly done.The Thing is set in the Antarctic (in fact it was shot in British Columbia). It is made clear to the viewer that there is no possibility of escape for any of the members of the research crew. The location also creates a feeling of loneliness and isolation where each one of the dozen men is basically on his own and therefore contributes to the paranoid undertone.And of course the film has state-of-the-art special effects and lighting. Rob Bottin simply did a great job. There is lots of gore and some very inventive scenes were the thing changes its shape. Some of the effects had to be done several times and others were deleted because Carpenter and Bottin didn't want the effects to be laughable or cheesy. The effects are outstanding and astonishing even for today's standards. They are much more interesting to look at than modern computer-animated special effects.But the most important thing that made this film believable are the actors (it is a male-only film by the way). Each and everyone of the cast was convincing which is a rare thing. Although there are twelve or so men in this film who are almost equally important (with Kurt Russell becoming some kind of a leader) Carpenter managed to give each one of them an own character in a very short time. He didn't even need to include much dialogue to make the persons seem real.I recommend this film to anyone who is interested in Carpenter's work and/or horror films and doesn't have a weak stomach.My rating: 10/10</fullReview>

It had some convincing gore, some effective special effects, and some good, but not great acting to bring a real sense of dread for the characters. If you don't like horror films, 'The Thing' will disappoint you, but if you can remember back to when you used to sit around a campfire, holding a flashlight up to your face, speaking in a creepy tone of voice, you will enjoy the Thing.

		<shortDescription>An intense drama with horror elements</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When John Carpenter is at his best, he has no equal, and his early works are, IMHO, his best. This one, however, is probably my favorite. I do not consider this a horror film, but rather as an intense drama with horror elements, much in the same way David Cronenberg's remake of "The Fly" was a tragic love story with horror elements. This is a character-driven piece and is a shining example of great ensemble acting. These guys seemed to be really into their characters. Ennio Morricone's score sounded like Carpenter wrote it himself. It is minimal, yet very effective, especially the pulsing two-note motive in the bass. The icing on the cake is the eye-popping visual and makeup effects, supervised by Rob Bottin and Albert Whitlock. See this film, and ALL of Carpenter's films for that matter, in letterbox format.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank You, Thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that "The Thing" is one of the greatest horror films of all time. There, I said it, and I'd say it again if I had to. This movie is almost perfect. The outstanding effects are worth the price of admission alone, but the whole movie is just put together so well: the plot gives you the amount of information you need to understand what's happening but not too much as to get in the way of the thrills. The cast is flawless, with each of the dozen characters fleshed out in an amazingly short period of time. Even the dog is a fantastic actor. I rarely gush unabashedly about a movie, but really, it's a masterpiece. Just the "heart attack" sequence alone puts this in the pantheon of great horror flicks. My complaints are few- parts of the story are a little hard to get upon one viewing, but rather than there being plot holes there is room for discussion for what's going on. What we see is not all that is going on- the people in this movie are always doing something, even if it's not on screen. The ambiguous ending also allows for tons of post-viewing conversation. So I guess what I'm trying to say is, "The Thing" is one of my all time favorite horror movies, and definitely John Carpenter's best work. If you haven't seen it, you should, and if you have seen it you should see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was on a hot-streak when "The Thing" came out. He had Halloween, a landmark film for horror, the very good "The Fog" and the cult classic "Escape from New York" under his belt, so he tried his hand on sci-fi/horror combination (two genres which he knew best).The thing succeeds because people like to see gore, and while that concept was sort of new to Carpenter (earlier movies were almost goreless), he succeeds in making one of the gorest films in history.While the movie sometimes moves at a glacial pace, the story is well developed (like an X-files episode), the characters are at least identifable (sometimes, movies with alot of people in situations, I sometimes forget whose who!). Not really scary, there is a lot of suspense and tension built up, because1. The people don't know who the alien (thing) is and2. They don't seem to like each other and would have no problems blowing each other away.For a good movie (skip the popcorn on this one), with the right mood music, darkened lighting, plenty of gore and tense atmospherical cinematography, try out "The Thing"</fullReview>

It also has the best line ever...(trying not to spoil the plot here), Kurt Russell turns to "The Thing" of the title, says "f**k you too!" under his breath, and throws a stick of dynamite at it. Marvelous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a box-office flop and it didn't exactly receive a lot of rave reviews either. The "Fat Guy &amp; Skinny Guy" (Ebert &amp; Siskel) split on it - Roger liked it but Gene was put off by the graphic violence. Well, take it from me and Roger that this a movie worth seeing! Not only is it a remake of the 1951 classic, but it is also "Alien" and "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" all rolled into one! Yes folks, this movie combines the plot of the original movie with a monster that constantly metamorphoses like the "Alien" and one that can also replace unsuspecting humans with perfect (albeit extra-terrestrial) carbon copies. In addition to being a great sci-fi/horror/action flick, John Carpenter's "The Thing" also has a great element of suspense as well: who is really human and who isn't? Only "The Thing" knows for sure as it goes about killing off the motley crew of losers and misfits forced to deal with it and replacing its' victims with perfect look-alikes! Needless to add, this doesn't make things any easier for our ragtag and mostly gutless heroes, who are at each other's throats every time someone gets killed since they all suspect each other of being the extra-terrestrial murderer. I don't know why this movie seems to be either ignored, snubbed or disliked by most critics and ordinary folks but in my opinion this is an overlooked classic of sci-fi/horror and suspense.

		<shortDescription>Grim, genuinely frightening horror epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Easily John Carpenter's best film, "The Thing" is that rarest of movie rarities -- a remake of a classic film that is every bit as good as the original. Backed by a pounding, heartbeat-like synthesizer score from the brilliant Ennio Morricone, "The Thing" opens (following a pre-titles UFO "teaser") with striking, beautifully choreographed images of a low flying helicopter chasing a dog through a desolate, frozen landscape. The finale is just as stunningly filmed, the story bleakly and ambiguously ending in that same landscape awash in redhot flames. In between, "The Thing" offers some of the most potently horrific sequences ever shot. John W. Campbell's original short story "Who Goes There?" is followed much more closely here than in Howard Hawks' version, resulting in some awesomely effective man-to-monster transformations. Although these make-up effects have been much copied since 1982, the film has lost little of its power to shock even the most jaded of horror fans. Carpenter's direction is stylish and assured, filling almost every sequence with the maximum amount of dread and suspense possible. Add Morricone's thumping, eerie music to the mix and you end up with one of the most terrifying of all movie experiences. (The DVD and laser disc versions are highly recommended, crammed as they are with wonderful additional goodies, including a shot-by-shot audio track discussion by Carpenter and star Kurt Russell, as well as an informative eighty minute documentary of the film's production.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thing was released a few weeks after E.T. in 1982 and Blade Runner was released a few weeks before E.T., resulting in dismal box office for both of these films. Blade Runner has, of course, gotten its due over the years, but The Thing still hides in relative obscurity (perhaps in one of us...get the flame- thrower!). While not as groundbreaking a classic as Ridley Scott's masterpiece, it's certainly worth repeated viewings. It is a good ol' fashioned scary movie, and certainly Carpenter's best work. If you've only seen in on TV with commercials or on cable a dozen years ago, see it again (if possible a wide screen copy as Carpenter used the 2.35:1 screen beautifully to create a mood and place). No stupid cop-out endings or cheesy one-liners here, just great storytelling. Best seen at night, during a snowstorm, with the lights and heat turned off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A character study in paranoia.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's "The Thing" isn't so much a horror movie as it is an in -depth portrait of human paranoia and the unconsciously manipulative effect situations can have on us all. By no means is this film an essay. It is a gut-wrenching mind game of second guessing and graphic violence that, quite frankly, shocked me upon initially viewing it. It's a scary movie of the first order, one that understands the difference between what is really scary and what is simply there for it's own sake. This remake of "The Thing From Another World" (which actually more closely resembles the novella "Who Goes There?") isn't a favorite of critics. There are reasons for this, although the artistry or effectiveness of "The Thing" have little to do with them. This movie has several strikes against it. Strike one: it is a remake, and one that dares (God forbid) to be a different film than it's predecessor. Strike two: graphic gore typically strikes professional critics as gratuitous regardless of the context it holds in the film. Already, this film is on shaky ground. Well, I personally have made it a rule never to take anyone's word on a film other then my own. My word? This movie isn't perfect, though in watching it, you're not looking for that. Perhaps that last sentence needs amending. It perfectly does what it intends to do: scare it's audience. One of Carpenter's finest. I loved this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thing (9/10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In numerous interviews John Carpenter has pointed to Howard Hawks as his favorite director, so it comes no surprise that he wanted to pay homage to his film "The Thing from Another World". Thus, Carpenter directed The Thing, alongside a stellar team behind the scenes that include Rob Bottin (special effects) and Ennio Morricone (music). Kurt Russell stars as the stoic R.J. MacReady, a scientist stationed in remote Antarctica. The setting, Antarctica, has really never been seen in a horror film, so with all the snow and cold, it provided a great hopeless dark atmosphere. The cast around Russell were also suburb with all delivering great written dialog. The story is brilliant, leaving the viewer's clueless to who might potentially be the shape shifting monster and what will be happening next. The uncertainty of The Thing stays all the way to the ending scene, which is still talked and dissected by horror fanatics to this day. The Thing is a classic horror, recognized as one of John Carpenter's finest. Watch it if you haven't seen it now!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A claustrophobic and grotesque cult classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thing is an intelligent blend of sci-fi and horror which is now a cult classic.This is about a group of scientists working in Antarctica. Eventually they find a husky which appears to be infected with something far sinister which begins to spread.The movie's main focus is its special effects. Despite the fact that they are over 30 years old, they still look just as grotesque and disturbing today as they did back in 1982. Because of the special effects, several scenes have become iconic. The most famous one being the chest defibrilator scene which was really unexpected.The movie shows us how the scientists quickly turn on each other after they discover that the thing can look like any one of them. The viewer keeps pointing fingers throughout the film and it's a surprise every time one of them is revealed to be infected. The movie's ending is ambiguous and it has inspired a lot of discussions and debates in social media sites. Its ending leaves plenty of room for re-watching the film to look for clues you might have missed your first viewing. I'm not going to spoil anything but it is quite a shocker.The tension is cranked up more since the characters are cut off from the outside world. This concept was borrowed by "Alien" and it heavily influenced "Aliens". Unfortunately, this movie failed at the box office probably since it was released 2 weeks after "E.T. The Extra Terrestrial". But its great production choices with effects and concepts is what made it into a cult classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An American scientific expedition to the frozen wastes of the Antarctic is interrupted by a group of seemingly mad Norwegians pursuing and shooting a dog. The helicopter pursuing the dog explodes, eventually leaving no explanation for the chase. During the night, the dog mutates and attacks other dogs in the cage and members of the team that investigate. The team soon realises that an alien life-form with the ability to take over other bodies is on the loose and they don't know who may already have been taken over.....It seemed in the eighties, well the majority of the decade, Carpenter made a career defining movie, every time he made a movie, especially if it starred Kurtz Russell.He changed the face of horror for over twenty years with Halloween, Changed the attitude of Science Fiction with Escape from New York, BTILC, They Live, and this, probably his greatest film of the eighties.And it's great because its so simple, it's tense because you put yourself in their situation, in the middle of nowhere,with literally nowhere to go or to hide, and not being able to trust anyone.And that's the premise, it could be any film, any genre, any setting, but the fact that its in the middle of the coldest place on earth, and the inclusion of a body morphing alien, that generates the terror, and it generates it in droves.Before anything happens alien wise, there is still an air of tension between the crew, after all they are confined to the setting, so they must get tired of each other from time to time.And then the dog arrives.After that, it just goes bonkers, and even almost thirty five years after its initial release, those special effects are still amazing, oh to see this on its initial release must have been something else.The cast are brilliant, Russell appears and acts a lot advanced in his years, and the film keeps you guessing until the end.If you do enough research, one of the survivors isn't as he seems during the final reel, and it makes it all the more chilling.Groundbreaking stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In Carpenter's Masterpiece, 'Thing's Truly are Seldom What They Seem!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's The Thing is one of those beloved relics of the '80s that was considered a game-changer for creature-features. Viewing the movie thirty years removed from that era, the ideas it presents remain as alarming as ever; this is not a thriller in which ordinary beasts seek to destroy a gathering of unsuspecting victims, but one in which they take on the traits of earthly organisms and walk among them as part of a convincing ruse to adapt to a new foreign environment.Ominously bland shots of the Antarctic profile introduce us to R.J. MacReady (Kurt Russell), a pilot with an American research crew who, along with a gathering of other morose men, is about to be involved in one hell of a tricky predicament. The marvelously disconcerting prologue suggests so, of course, as a handsome Alaskan malamute (with a little more sobriety than typically seen in dogs) gallops across the Antarctic tundra, a nearby helicopter full of eager Norwegians pursues it, hoping to shoot the animal dead in its tracks. That grim pursuit takes them right into the base of the American researchers, who respond with confounding resistance. An explosion and an assassination later, the American crew takes the dog in, only to discover too late that appearances can be deceptive. It turns out that the dog is indeed the alien creature that has assumed the guise of a dog. It soon proceeds to infiltrate the unsuspecting crew members of the camp, and the good guys try to figure out which of them may have been compromised. Throughout the course of the movie, a lot of terrible things happen to this ensemble of characters while the monster in its fuzzy new form snuggles up to its fresh banquet of victims. What it does is the unthinkable: consume people and then essentially take on their characteristics, allowing them to move undetected amongst others. When this knowledge is shared with the scientists, ensuing hysteria overwhelms their need for survival, and inevitably the movie becomes a cat-and-mouse game in which it's not just about how to destroy the fiend, but where to find it and who to trust among the ensemble of wary survivors.Carpenter's thriller is a masterful exercise in claustrophobic suspense, far superior to other sloppy efforts that have saturated the market with a relentless supply of bloodthirsty monsters jumping out from the shadows: a peerless masterpiece of retina-wrecking visuals (with remarkable special effects). Carpenter capitalizes on the dramatic possibilities inherent in the contrast between the cramped interiors of the station and the vast expanse of the wintry landscape outside. He uses this disparity to amazing effect to create an atmosphere of testosterone-fueled paranoia. The strong cast brings the somewhat underwritten characters to vivid life.Though are eyes are horrified and our hearts often unsettled, we watch on as if hypnotized by an unfolding nightmare from which there is no turning away!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter's sci fi/horror masterwork!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kurt Russell and John Carpenter collaborate again in this frostbitten masterpiece of extraterrestrial terror. Kurt is the lead and the film contains an excellent ensemble all male cast. In this horror/science fiction story and sausage party, our cast and film makers deliver the goods. They are a twelve man research team in Antarctica and have discovered that a shape shifting alien is capable of imitating anything and infects and imitates its host. If it reaches civilization, it could mean the extinction of all life on planet Earth. The special f/x by Robert Botin are state of the art and truly remarkable. The tone of the film is stark, apocalyptic and dead serious. The atmosphere is cold and tense, enhanced to great effect by Ennio Morricone's brilliant score. Performances by the cast are very solid and another one of my favorite actors Keith David also appears and gives our lead, Kurt some competition as alpha male of the show. Keith David also worked with John Carpenter on They Live, another classic and huge favorite of mine. This was the first film which John Carpenter refers to as his apocalypse trilogy. The three films have nothing to do with one another, but deal with a potential end of the world situation in different ways. The other two films are Prince Of Darkness and In The Mouth Of Madness which are both very good as well. The Thing is one of his best films and you can feel the coldness and isolation as this group of men struggle for survival on this Antarctic glacier. Great winter viewing and goes down even better for yours truly with some hot chocolate and sponge candy as snow rapidly falls.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is brilliant. The setting of the antarctic is perfect, it adds to the idea of isolation and really makes the film semi- believable, I mean if there's one place a killer alien can go unnoticed for so long, surely it's here right? The special effects are unbelievably good considering it was released in 1982. It works on so many levels. You can take whatever you want from this film. You can watch it just for pure horror and shock value, or you can watch it for a rather interesting look at the human psyche. The paranoia running through the film makes it stand out from other horrors. Mac isn't your typical hero but that makes the film seem much more real and adds to the horror. Overall, a fantastic film and you can take as much as you want from it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most people will already know about 'The Thing,' but, if you don't, it's about a monstrous shape-shifting alien running riot among an American base in the arctic.And it's fantastic. That's all you need to know. However, instead of listing all its many plus points (of which there are probably too many to mention), I will simply point out that, as it was popular, it probably wasn't long before some Hollywood money-man decided to cash in on its success and remake it.It never happened (well, it sort of did, but it didn't). Even Hollywood was at a loss as to whether they could attempt to 'better' such a work of horror genius. So they didn't. They left it as it is and it's all the better for it. They did make a 'prequel' which you can take or leave, depending on your taste. The original is obviously far better, so, if you choose to only watch one, definitely go for John Carpenter's 1982 original.Bottom line: if you like horror, if you like sci-fi, if you love bizarre and monstrous creatures and spine-tingling tension, then this is for you. It may have been made over thirty years ago, but it's still as fresh and chilling as when it first came out. For the few people who haven't seen it, I won't mention its best parts, but the special effects - for their time - were truly breath-taking (and hideous).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Don't Have to Be a Horror Fan to Love The Thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review will remain vague. In fact, I think the IMDb description is too much. You should go in as blind as possible.The Thing is one of the few horror films I've liked, let alone loved. First of all, few have such a mysterious, creepy atmosphere. You are given plenty of time to let the situation settle, ponder the mysteries with the characters, and question everything that comes across the screen. You're further isolated by the cold, inhospitable environment of Antarctica. Nothing feels right, so you're always on the edge of your seat.Character is much better than in most horror films. None of them are useless, annoying cannon fodder. They act how you and I would act to the situation. Each has their own traits, occupation, and moments in the film. You don't want to see any of them die. MacReady is a good action lead - cocky, but takes things seriously. He also has a cool beard. The characters aren't fleshed-out, but its impressive for a horror film with a large cast.The effects are considered among the best in practicals ever made. You'll need to see that for yourself.The Thing is the perfect horror film that deserves its resurgence. It doesn't treat the audience like teenage idiots, and few can match its constant tone. You will not see me rate a horror film higher than this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stomach-turning mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A motley band of Americans stationed at a lonely outpost base in Antarctica inadvertently find themselves sheltering a monstrous shape-shifting alien, which can assume their identities, leading to rampant showdowns and paranoia.The 1951 version of The Thing does not just rank as one of my favorite horror films, but one of my favorite all-time films period. So watching director John Carpenter take a glorified crap on it does not rank highly on my entertainment scale, but alas that is exactly what he does. Amazingly this fetid remake has some sort of cult following that has developed over the years, but I am at a loss at to why, unless they are gore-seekers salivating over the next slimy effect to splash across the screen.I gather that this film version adheres more closely to the source novel "Who Goes There?", but that only serves to show that original filmmakers Howard Hawks, Christian Nyby and company knew what they were doing when they abandoned it. Other than the bleak snowbound setting, there is nothing especially notable or compelling about this film. Fans seem to be reading much more depth into it than ever appears on screen or in the writing. The "are you human or a monster" bit had already been done to death long before this film hit the screen and was fully realized in far better films, primarily Invasion of the Body Snatchers, which had also received an effective and chilling modernization just a few years previously.A big part of the problem with focusing on this paranoia approach is that in the Invasion films, the characters were developed capably and were sufficiently sympathetic enough to warrant concern when they succumbed to the Body Snatchers. Here, the characters are humorless, dull and unsympathetic. We cannot tell who is human or alien because none of them seemed particularly human from the start. Whereas the Hawks original populated the base with a believable, appealing and often amusing gallery of people to be terrorized, Carpenter provides us with paper-thin monuments to testosterone that test patience. None of them are likable or worth investing much concern in. Perfectly solid actors like Wilford Brimley, Keith David, Donald Moffat, etc., have little to do but glare at each other and pose in manly fashion.Lead Kurt Russell can be a solid actor as well, but director Carpenter never seemed able to bring out his best, eliciting performances that either seem to be tiresomely buffoonish (Big Trouble in Little China) or a catatonic rendition of a low-wattage Clint Eastwood (here and Escape from New York).With the story and characters completely underwhelming, Carpenter tries to make up the difference with a repellent cabinet of curiosity gore effects that do nothing but demonstrate that energy that should have been directed to more meaningful areas was squandered in trying to make the viewer puke. The budget for blood, pus, ooze, slime and innards must have been astronomical.Even worse, Carpenter's direction itself is inert. The film has virtually no suspense or forward momentum - it lurches like a drunk from one set piece to the next, scored by yet another one of Carpenter's overly synthesized dirges. I cannot recall one extended suspense sequence in the entire film that raises the pulse even minimally. And anyone waiting for a blow-out climax will be surprised by the vague, low-key final moments in which Carpenter caps the film. A more unsatisfying climax is hard to imagine.The film also provides evidence of why it is a blessing that Carpenter has refrained from directing for a number of years. After first-rate work on the deservedly legendary Halloween and the underrated The Fog, Carpenter repeatedly provided ambitious concepts done in by almost spectacularly lackluster execution, to the point where it seemed as though a rank amateur was responsible. The Thing and Escape from New York certainly marked the beginning of this decline.Misguided fans like to say that this film was overlooked in 1982 (like the similar Blade Runner) because it was lost in the success of E.T. Sad to tell them, but Blade Runner had a following as early as 1982. The Thing, at the time, was a box office dud and critically dismissed as a botched remake that functioned as little more than a effects freak show. That description still holds true several decades later. Genre fans can keep this stinkbomb, I will head back to the company of original and its much-deserved classic status.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To its immediate credit, it must be said that 'The Thing' has one of the most impressive, and iconic, opening sequences in film ... the scene of an unknown gunman in a helicopter following the seemingly terrified, yet magnificent, huskie across the barren snows of the Antarctic, remains etched in memory long long after the film has drawn to its finale.And the finale, too, with its bleak air of uncertainty and unspoken words hanging in the air, too, remains equally memorable ... so much is left unsaid ...But in between, the film is just another gore and splatter "creature feature", of a malevolent alien visitation on our peaceful planet. I would hesitate to categorize it as horror, for there are no truly scary scenes in the film - the effect of the few "jump shocks", too, fade away too fast. Sfx-wise, true, the metamorphozing scenes from human to monster are well executed, but, beyond that, fail to terrify, or even, for that matter, to thrill. It's the usual man-versus-monster flick, with the majority falling prey, and a dismal few surviving ... if they do at all, that is.What succeeds for the film is the atmosphere ... set entirely against the blank snow and the claustrophobic environs of an Antarctic station, the blustering winds and flickering lights do build a sense of menace, which continues throughout its length. And to John Carpenter's credit, he does keep the audience guessing - who's man and who's monster? Performances are nothing to write home about ... it's one of Kurt Russell's earlier ventures, but, as is unavoidable in a film like this, he, like the other characters, has little do, except to try and set things right and restore some sort of equilibrium.But does he? You are still undecided about it at the end, and THAT's where 'The Thing' scores, and elevates itself above the routing creature flick which it otherwise, unquestionably, is.Otherwise passable, but worth a watch for the beginning, and the end.</fullReview>

A parasitic shape-shifting creature gets thawed out as it hides inside a few members of the team, paranoia starts and all must out who is The Thing.An electrifying and shocking yet brilliant movie that combines horror with science fiction thanks to director John Carpenter who brought us such classics like "Halloween" and "Escape from New York". The film has an all guy cast especially the talented Kurt Russell as RJ Macready and lovable Oatmeal spokesperson Wilford Brimley without his mustache. The special effects are very effect for it's time especially in these days of computer graphics, nothing could be compared to the amazing and grotesque gore and alien effects by Rob Bottin and Stan Winston, the movie even gives the viewer a sense of paranoia on the characters who have to deal with the shape-shifting monster. It's not a remake of the earlier film, it's a re-adaptation of John Campbell's 1938 novella "Who Goes There" and is very faithful to the story which was something the earlier film ditched.A must have and must see movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter's "The Thing" is, most would agree, indeed a very frightening piece of filmaking. But unlike other films which rely on cheap and clichd scary tactics for all the frights "The Thing" is bloodcurdling in several different ways. First there's the gore which will surely put off many due to its explicitness and inventive grotesqueness. Second there's the scenery with its chilled and chilling feel of isolation and its "no one's getting out alive" vibe. Thirdly the most unsettling aspect is that it lays out a distrustful relationship among these men, they're all together but not once do they, or indeed can they, trust one another which is clearly made out by lines like "Trust is a hard thing to come by these days" or "You'll have to sleep sometime".Paranoia fills the air while the tension seethes inside each character threatening to boil over.So it's about the natural fear of the unknown but also about being alone in a world you can't by no means control."The Thing" while also marking career highpoints for Carpenter, Kurt Russel and Keith David is one of the finest, most terrifying and intelligent horror movies you can get your hands on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carpenter's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is Carpenter's "ten". He nailed the special effects, but more importantly the lonely, isolated characters, already on the verge of a blowup before the "thing" shows up.The pacing is so well done you don't realize you're being led around by a master. Although The Fog, Precinct 13, and Halloween 1 are super, The Thing is the REAL DEAL.The cast is typical Carpenter: TV actors (Wilford Brimley), or second chance actors, or one-note deadpan actors (Kurt Russell), and they all do the job necessary to not distract from the suspense. Because suspense is key here and it does not let up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's The Thing is an amazing (horror) movie. With an outstanding cast, unbelievable special effects, an eerie Antarctic setting and a creepy score, The Thing is one of my absolute favourites and one of the most gruesome, scariest horror movies made! After a group of Norwegian scientists uncover some sort of aircraft in Antarctica, a deadly shape-shifting alien escapes. A group of American scientists are also in Antarctica and soon enough the alien has found them and begins to wreck havoc on them as they each get more suspicious as to who is human and who is the Thing! This is a remake of the black and white The Thing From Another World. Although it takes more from the short story 'Who Goes There?' John Carpenter has created a timeless sci-fi/horror classic. The cast (Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, Keith David, Donald Moffat and Charles Hallahan) are great as the scientists who soon begin to turn on one another. The special effects are the highlight, though. They are outstanding and are much better than any CGI you'll see. They are sickening and not for the weak-stomachs out there. The score (although not done by Carpenter) is still very much like him, it is eerie and it sets the mood perfectly. The Antarctic setting gives the us a feel of isolation and the' can't escape' feel.Surprisingly, this didn't do well when released. Probably due to Spielberg's friendlier E.T. But today the cult status and fan base is huge and it's thought of as one of the greatest horror movies ever made. This is recommended for any fan of sci-fi, horror or Carpenter.5/5!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very good film is one of my all time favourites's. The storyline is very well written and is a must see film to any alien loving sci-fi film fans!!Also a very enticing ending which will keep you guessing days after you've watched it which will make you watch it more and more to just try and find any clues. very good choice of actors which make the film intense and questions who is actually the thing? At the end of the film you'll most certainly have more questions than answers which also adds to the enjoyment of a well made film that you will want to watch over and over again. The spooky music fits right in with the fact that these men are isolated from the world and have nowhere to escape and should provide you with an excellent way to pass your time by.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpender's the Thing should be a model for all horror films. The amazing part of this movie is not that it is loaded with special effects and easy to predict plot lines. The horror of the film doesn't come from a giant easily identifiable monster, but from the development of its characters and their own inner doubts and fears. The ending is excellent, the dialogue is wonderful, and the premise especially is both engaging and original. This is a film that does not use cheap tricks, but strong writing, acting and directing to convey it's point. I would recommend this movie to anyone, but especially to people who are often bored by modern (recent) horror movies. This film establishes John Carpenter as an undisputed master of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best of its type</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thing must be considered one the best within the genre of Sci-Fi horror movies, together with the first two of the Alien films. Set in Antarctica it captures the atmosphere of isolation, eerie feeling of fear and terror of the unknown. Together with terrific special effects (the head sprouting legs and scuttling away must rank amongst the greatest scenes in the annals of Sci-Fi horror), and good acting by the principal actors, it is one the most memorable of films. I was somewhat shocked and disturbed by the film when I first saw it, and the feeling of unease lingered in the mind for some time.The final scene is also one of the most interesting in the film, it leaves the story perhaps unfinished and in the viewer a deep sense of unresolved tension and unsettled fear.I probably would have given it a 9 or 10 for its sheer brilliance, but viewing it again many years later the shock factor has somewhat diminished, perhaps lowering unfairly the appreciation of the film. Hence the slightly lower vote although it probably deserves more, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone who haven't seen it before.(vote amended to give a 9, it does deserve it on second thought.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A seemingly harmless dog runs into an American research station on Anatarctica pursued by men in a helicopter, that seem to have lost their mind, and are intent on killing as if it were the some terrible monstrosity. The Americans have no choice but to kill the crazed men, but out of curiosity as to what caused their bizarre actions they go to their camp which is completely wrecked and containing a mysterious canister found in the snow. Unable to make much of the situation they go back and put the new dog into the kennel with one they already have and... horror, unlike no other, begins.The horror of the film is a mixture of sickening gore and eerie atmosphere that John Carpenter used in films like 'Halloween." The two elements, under Carpenter's direction, work very well with literally frightening results and the "thing" of the title is an organism (for lack of a better word) to be reckoned with. It is virtually indescribable, even to one who has seen this film multiple times and that is what makes it so good. A similar film, 'Alien,' three years before this used the same formula or darkness and setting to create tension and the monster was also elusive, but here, the Thing isn't just elusive and predatory. After watching the film you should know what I mean.Essentially this film is a near perfect balance of psychological as well as visceral horror. The tension of the film is only equaled by the terrifying carnage and that, my friends, makes for one horror film that you cannot afford to miss. 10/10Rated R: graphic violence/carnage, horror, and profanity</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Within 15 minutes of Watching John Carpenters The Thing (1982)i realized that there had been an X-files episodes which was loosely based on this movie. Even though this is considered to be a classic i found myself enjoying the ex files episode more.The thing gets so close to being a brilliant piece of work at so many times but fails on each occasion. John Carpenter's goal of trying to keep the audience guessing on who the thing has taken over only merely succeeds, due to us not really getting to know the characters.Many of the action scenes which are meant to be spectacular are at times nothing more then bland when they could be so much more. Even the ending is nothing spectacular and seems a little rushed.John Carpenter's The Thing failed on many points and disappointed me greatly because it could have been so great. However, it is still an enjoyable movie that does work and is easy to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is easily the best film about paranoia I have ever seen.The film, about a shape-shifting, predatory alien that takes over any animal it eats and perfectly duplicates it, and endlessly reproduces as long as prey is available, is very frightening for its potential.The Thing seems to be a biological weapon from another world. Trapped in Antarctica far from the coast, it schemes to escape the polar stations where it is trapped. If it does so, every animal on Earth, including every human, faces extinction in a matter of a few years. Once it gets to a bird, a seal, a whale or a penguin, its escape is assured.We never see the true form of The Thing, though in WHO GOES THERE it was described as having three hate-filled red eyes.The Thing is totally and horribly hostile, and intelligent as well, which makes it a terrifying opponent.This movie gets my thumbs up as one of the best horror films ever made.MtLoweMan</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Savage bloody paranoia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a personal level, this is the film that "almost made me throw up when I was 8 years old". It was the first and the last, so you can imagine how much a milestone this film is for me. :) But, of course, I ended up watching this film when I'd become an adult, and it become quickly one of my favorite films ever. In fact, it would be up there with "Alien", hadn't it been the Carpenter film wouldn't have existed without Ridley Scott's masterpiece.What takes us to the point: "The Thing" owes "Alien" so much I can't give this movie a higher rating without feeling "dirty". However, of all the films that lift ideas from others, this is the best, no doubt about it, and the one who stands on its own more remarkably. In the end, this is movie is so good you will forget about the slight ripoff.Which are the basements of this movie? They have to be: environment, acting and, of course, FX.I'll start with FX, because they are so incredibly wild they'll stick in your head for a long time. They are insane and brilliantly implemented. I can only worship Rob Bottin for them, because his work is miles ahead of CGI. This man made me adore rubber and latex like no one. He's a true artist. I forgive him for making me feel sick when I was just a little boy.The environment is the most appropriate. It enhances the feelings of paranoia and true danger we have to sit through. If you add a disturbing bass beat for music, you get it. An isolation feeling almost impossible to excel. There is a certain shot of pure genius: all survivors meet under the snowfall, each suspecting of the other, dressed up in their anoraks. It's bright, because they all look the same from a certain distance, all their heads hidden under hoods. Everyone could be the monster, so the smell of menace permeates the screen. Great scene.And what about the acting? Awesome, credible. This is one of the few movies I have liked Kurt Russell unreservedly. You may laugh at what I'm going to say, but even the dog gives a hell of a performance. God, how could he stare at the camera like that? Ahhh, the 80s... when remakes had a reason to be made and the results were exceptional...RATING: 9.2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. Even with the now outdated special effects, it has enough momentum to send grown men fleeing from the living room. You may not want to see this movie if you are an animal lover and I staunchly urge you not to watch it while you're eating. The story is similar to the older, black and white classic on which it was based. A group of researchers are stationed in the Artic and come across an unworldly presence which has been dug up from years of dormancy beneath the ice. The acting is really superb and the starkness of the surrounds really sets the tone of mistrust between the characters. There is always a feeling of isolation in the film...which can quickly transfer to the audience. Not recommended as a date movie though. Instead of bringing you together, you'll find you and your date casting suspicious glances at each other and wishing for a petrie dish and some hot wire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie should be retitled: "How to destroy an original movie script." I saw the original movie as a kid and I loved it. I loved how I was terrified of the Thing and how I was encouraged by the heros. It was so excellent. There was real palpable anticipation in the original. It was done with intelligence and creativity.However, in today's world intelligence has been replaced by blood and creativity has been replaced by boobs. John Carpenter is no different (sans boobs). His lack of creativity is profound. His zeitwelt is typical of today: "humans are evil and need to die." I guess the movie is really a "film noir" of man's place in the universe.I hated this movie. However it is well done and is watchable (unlike his "Ghosts of Mars" fiasco). 8/10- ZafoidPS: If you too saw the original as a kid - the excitement, the drama, the acting, the sci-fi!

		<shortDescription>Nightmarish special effects highlight this decent film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's "The Thing" is the type of movie where the special effects (by a young Rob Bottin) make the film. If the film did not contain the gory, slimy and disgusting images that are seen it would be a dull, albeit semi-suspenseful flick. The film stars five or six of the best character actors in Hollywood (Richard Masur, Donald Moffat and Keith David) on top of a slightly generic Kurt Russell performance. All in all, no viewer could ever forget the kind of fun this alien creature has with its human hosts. It literally tries to become the organism it "absorbs". And some characters get it BAD. These scenes of terror are truly disturbing, especially for a younger viewer - which I was when I first saw it. I really won't go into details here, but let me just say that Mr. Bottin's creative genius makes this film exceptional. He must've had a great time designing these 'things' we see on the screen.

		<shortDescription>An Admirable, Yet Generally Average Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>R.J. MacReady (Kurt Russel) is a helicopter pilot stationed at a US research facility in Antarctica along with ten other researchers and staff members. While prepping for a pending snowstorm, the team encounters a group of Norwegans desperately shooting at a lone sled dog. In the ensuing scuffle, the Norwegans both die and the dog is adopted by the Americans. It turns out, however, that the dog was really an alien lifeform capable of disguising itself as any living creature it "samples" and spread like a virus to other organisms. Now the team is being picked of one by one, and anybody could be a "Thing." Despite the familiar and generally worn down plot, "The Thing" boasts some of the better visual effects ever caught on film. The depiction of "The Thing," especially as it mutates from a seemingly mundane source (a dog or a average-looking human) is nothing short of nightmarish. Most times it comes off as a mix between a zombie and a spider, although at others it more ambitiously sports an extensively twisted, tortured-looking face, rows of unnaturally-placed teeth and other Hellish details. The hollow, soulless moans that the transforming Things give out is genuinely unsettling, moreso than any mere scream could achieve.The arctic setting perfectly expresses the sense of isolation and hopelessness that the titular Thing thrives in. Carpenter realizes a near "Shining" level of isolation through the film's bleak, unending whiteness (sharply juxtaposed against the night sky). Even during brightly lit daytime scenes, Carpenter never fails to create an atmospheric sense of unease.Kurt Russel does a commendable job in the lead role. While nothing exceptional in its own right, it does get the job done here. Keith David is an actor that I'm never disappointed to see. Even if he's not a particularly talented individual, he has a commanding presence on screen that makes him something of a poor man's Samuel L. Jackson.Despite excellent visuals and solid direction, the film never really rises beyond simply being average. It's entertaining more than anything, which can hardly be considered a bad thing. Fans of science fiction or horror alike will enjoy this eery, effects-laden remake of the original 1951 film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thing is not only a brilliant remake(which I was not expecting after seeing abominations such as Psycho and The Wicker Man) but it is also a brilliant film that seamlessly blends horror and sci-fi amongst other things.The atmosphere is especially what makes the movie so good. To this day, very few other movies have shocked, haunted or unnerved me as much as The Thing. The scenery, sets and costumes are eye-popping and the effects are brilliantly designed and suitably grotesque without distracting too much.There is also Ennio Morricone's most haunting score, a cracking script and a deliberately slow-paced but compelling story that is quite ahead of its time. Not to mention wonderful direction and credible and well-written characters. The acting is equally great, in my mind Kurt Russell has never been better, likewise with Keith David and Wilford Brimley has brilliant delivery of the lines.All in all, a brilliant film and one essentials and its genre(s). 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior to the original - Carpenter's best movie, hands down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it quite remarkable that Christian Nyby's The Thing From Another World (1951) is always held up as an all-time towering sci fi classic, yet when viewed against John Carpenter's 1982 'remake' it is blatantly clear which version has the edge...and how *bad* the 51 movie actually is. I saw Carpenter's movie long before I saw Nyby's, so maybe that is why I'm biased towards the former, but let's face it, people, the original film is stagy, badly acted and horribly overrated. On the other hand, Carpenter's film is edgy, paranoid, brilliantly shot and perfectly performed. I'm not being paid to say this, my friends; like Mr Tarantino, I freakin' LOVE this movie.I suppose it helps that Carpenter actually chose to do an adaption of the source novella, Who Goes There?...Nyby's movie is really nothing like the book at all. William Campbell's often tripped-out 1938 story has been translated by Carpenter into an artifact of its' early 80s era. That is to say, plenty of gore, post-Watergate world-weary 'heroes' who react instinctively rather than earnestly, and a distinct lack of hope. One might almost call it the welcome antidote to the mawkish saccharine (another and wholly opposite facet of the early Reagan era) that was The Thing's box office opponent, ET.Carpenter in The Thing is light years from the rubbish he'd trot out after his last truly great movie, Prince Of Darkness (though In The Mouth Of Madness was a rare return to form amidst some truly lousy movies from Mr C). Here, he's the youthful, edgy, guerilla filmmaker with a touch of stoned poetry that made him the cult icon he is today. The direction is sparse but deft, showing great economy of movement and some of the best examples of 'directing lots of people in a tight space' work I have ever seen. Carpenter knows when to not direct and just let scenes play - he makes you think you are watching a tape of true events at times, just as our heroes do at one point in the story.And it's genuinely *scary*, too. Our scruffy band of Antarctic outpost scientist heroes are confronted by and trapped with a defrosted alien menace that can imitate any life form it encounters...and imitate it so perfectly that it seems that even the duplicates don't know they're duplicates. Our characters are forced into a nightmare where paranoia is actually a virtue, where you can literally trust no-one. There's one thing the creature wants, and that is to reach a populated area and begin an infection that could swamp the entire human race in just 27,000 hours....The oft-mentioned gore is pretty extreme, and there are numerous examples of sheer gross-out body horror. The most famous example has to be *that* bit with the defibrillator paddles- oh God, that bit made me jump out of my skin the first time I saw it. Leonard Maltin might claim that the 'non-stop parade of icky effects' are off-putting, but the grossness of the effects is the *whole point*, Lenny! This creature literally devours a victim, absorbs its' DNA and changes into the victim! To show this process as anything other than flat-out crunch-and-splatter would be..well, silly.Kurt Russell gives the performance of his career here as our hero, Macready; a shaggy-haired, alcoholic, sombrero-wearing chopper pilot who's the only one of our isolated protagonists who realises the truth -that survival is all that matters - in time to save himself. But that's not to say that the rest of the cast are slackers; each of the other 11-odd people in the all-male cast are top-notch. Wilford Brimley excels as the doomladen Blair, Keith David's his usual great self, and a nicely cast-against-type Donald Moffatt (remember him from Logan's Run: The Series?) gets the film's best line when he's tied to a chair.And who can go past Ennio Morricone's music? It's one of his last scores, and one of his best...a moody, pulsating collection of mainly bass tones that serves the same function as Bernard Herrman's slashing strings in Psycho - to heighten the palpable sense of unavoidable doom.There is literally NOTHING wrong with this movie, folks. Not a single false step in the whole flick - even the so-called 'cop-out' ending is perfect. It is up there with Alien and Invasion Of The Body Snatchers '78 as one of the three best sci fi horror movies of all time. Forget the RKO original, because it really is not very good at all. THIS, though, this is the stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very good........ I think after 23years I may be close to fully understanding the film. The first to be infected/ imitated is Palmer..... When Nauls is told to turn the music down by Bennings, the suspect dog is looking for a host to hide within. We only see a shadow as he turns to the doorway to see the dog but I'll explain why it has to be Palmer. Until the "blood testing" scene Palmer shows no sign of infection, then just as he's blood is about to be tested, he shows the look of "my game is up"..... he transforms to take Windows and both are destroyed by flame throwers. So how does the Thing remain living? After it takes Palmer it can rely now completely on the diversions of the others' to remain anonymous, no-one suspects that someone else could be imitation (except Blair but not for very long) for he is quickly overtaken... as he analyzes the dogs' remains he unwittingly uses his pencil to point out that "That's not dog. It looks like dog. But it ain't dog. It's imitation." Then touches his lips with the same pencil- he has started to transform from that very moment. No- one realises at that time. Blair begins to destroy the camp and shoot up the place to limit the chances of outside contact or escape for anyone, but it doesn't like the Antarctic either and has to leave to survive, and so dismantles the chopper to construct his own means of escape. That is another story how Blair can orchestrate his imprisonment so he can remain alone to engineer plans for departure out of that hostile land in which survival comes from residing in the humans or dogs which are offer no protection at all to the Arctic conditions. Both Man and Thing are equal here. Both have to fight to survive here. Not only the environment but each other to live on........anyway, We see Blair running from the helicopter, then again prior to taking Garry thats it he is part of the 75% he computes at the beginning. The computers..... we know The Chess computer is a cheat? It makes mistakes....can Blairs computer be as unreliable? Think about that one. His ploy is to remain totally unsuspecting to all, whilst destroying the camp, the transport, the blood stocks. He also sets up his only threat, Macready, by placing his torn clothing around the camp, Blair left Macready's cabin light on as well. I have more to discuss about The Thing. The fact it wasn't a hit was because it wasn't a fairytale, where everyone lived happily ever after. It looks like no-one lives even the Thing. No-one won the battle to survive. Or did they/ it? I like to think Macready remains human, he has to be when no-one is left to fight, he still continues to finish off The Thing.... with "...k you too!" and some dynamite. But if Childs had seen Blair in the final scenes there is a real chance that when he goes outside to investigate that Blair deals with him there. So Macready is a doomed human destined to be frozen with or as a monster. Regards Marty. P.S John Carpenter offers us a chance to look outside the box and think about what we see. I'll love to write a sequel one day.</fullReview>

The story is an alien crash lands in the middle of winter in Antarctica or somewhere i can't quite remember and it can take over the body of anyone or anything. It takes over anyone who poses a threat so it ca wipe out the enemies around it so it has won and has no more enemies.**/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone is aware that in this movie there is an alien that can perfectly imitate another organism. Prior to watching this movie I was expecting that this would make an interesting dynamic among the characters. Maybe the characters would distrust each other strongly or cooperate or so on. I was expecting the writers would share their philosophy on human behavior in certain situations. After several more viewings my initial expectation became fulfilled. However when I watched the movie for the first time the special effects mesmerized me. In my opinion I believe that the special effects steals the show to an interesting concept. I am now aware that this story was originally written by John W. Campbell, so it is a film adaptation. I do find it faithful in story but it got clouded out because of the visceral and gory presentation. I am not saying the special effects "ruin" the movie but it could detract attention from the story. Simply and I will admit the special effects are that phenomenal; for better or worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's the start of winter. An isolation group of scientists at the United States National Science Institute Station 4 in Antarctica is interrupted by a Norwegian helicopter buzzing around. The Norwegians are throwing charges and shooting at a dog. George Bennings (Peter Maloney) is shot and Garry (Donald Moffat) kills the supposed mad Norwegian. Clark (Richard Masur) takes the dog in. MacReady (Kurt Russell) flies Dr. Blair (Wilford Brimley) and Garry to the Norwegian camp. They discover it smoldering and a place of massacre. Windows can't reach anybody on the radio.The makeup special effect is gruesome and astonishing. The pre-CGI real effect reaches an all-new high. The snowy atmosphere is stark. No room is given to sentimentality. Director John Carpenter has crafted an incredible masterpiece that is a must-watch for all horror fans. He brings out his music sound effects once again. The testing scene raises the tension beyond high. It's one of the most intense scenes in any horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I may give away some parts of the movie but if you continue to read you will be continued interested in watching this movie. You never know your neighbor could be the Thing. Good movie so much better than Thing 2 which was suppose to be the first to Kurt Russell - The Thing. Loved it - wished I could be turned into the Thing so that I could chase some people that made fun of me in life. They used the original plastic molds for the monster rather than all digital in second recent movie. The recent movie just missed the mark as overboard. Original is a great movie to see as it deals with science fiction. There are people that say we were put here on this earth by aliens, lets hope they are not the Thing aliens. Kurt Russell does a great a job in this movie as well as the other guy who lives at the end. Was he the monster or not? I think maybe. Yah - baby.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just my thoughts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am such a horror movie buff. I could not pass this sight without entering my opinion of this remake on line. Yes, I am one of those who loved the first Thing movie with James Arness and I absolutely loved the second with Kurt Russell. This one however, left me a little baffled and scratching my head. Even though the Carpenter film did start out a little slow with showing the actual monster in action, I felt that the leading up to it was brilliant and I loved every slow second of it. The only thing I liked about the new version was the fact that they showed more of Norwegian side of things. It to me was more of a pre-sequel version of John Carpenter's version. I have to honestly say that I didn't like any of the actors at all. In the other version, the actors were absolutely brilliant and it appeared more realistic because the actors appeared extremely scared throughout the entire movie which made me feel like I was on the edge of my seat all the time. I personally think the newest THING movie is for the newcomers not the old-timers like me. Any event, the new movie was still entertainment but thats it. I hope they continue this sequel but use Carpenter again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A smart and stylish ripoff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did like this film, don't get me wrong. Acting is good, the overall atmosphere is very dark and moody, the gore scenes remain impressive to this day, the special effects are fantastic (damn, why did the industry ever quit matte painting...) There is even character development and a very solid storyline. I love the idea of the extraterrestrial life form being, for once, DIFFERENT, not your usual Roswell-type creature with two arms and two legs... But men, you must admit this is a ripoff of Alien.(SPOILERS FOLLOW) Everything is there : the confined home within a hostile environment, the extra-terrestrial life form supposedly dead for thousands of years, the slow progression of the killings within the team by this seemingly unreachable ET, even some of the gruesome moments are heavily inspired by those in Alien. The cool thing is that you don't notice it during the film because Carpenter has his own way of telling a story, and the cinematography is unique. And hey, who knows if Ridley Scott wasn't himself inspired by The Thing From Another World...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Skillful, Though Far-Fetched and Shallow, Gross-Out Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter exercises as much control over his films as possible. As a pointer to this, many, including The Thing, bear his name as a suffix of sorts in the title. And Carpenter's film relies on its special effects, which are among the most laborious, revolting, and shocking spectacles by its time accomplished by Hollywood's technical wizards. There are times when it appears we are jutting our heads right down into the rancid, gore-gushing jaws of the unidentifiable, as the Thing metamorphoses itself into creatures with the body parts of dogs, men, lobsters, and spiders, all entrenched in gummy intestines. And Jesus, those poor poor dogs. Designer Rob Bottin's work is groundbreaking and extraordinary, yet because it endures in a near abyss in terms of emotional investment, it becomes too aesthetically oppressive and something of an enterprise in abstract art more than film.A spaceship crash-lands on Earth a zillion years ago and is entombed beneath Antarctic ice. There is an organism in it. It is thawed out and researchers in 1982 are ill-timed in finding out that it has the ability to mimic all life-forms. Its urge to live and enlarge is ravenous. It starts to simulate the sled dogs and then the scientists at a secluded Antarctic research station. The central issue comes to be who is real, and who is the Thing.This follow-up to Escape from New York is a skillful gross-out flick, hands down, not to mention scored not by Carpenter himself as per his usual but by the great Ennio Morricone, who departs from his usual aesthetic and composes a very low-key pulse to the movie. However, John Carpenter's The Thing is ineffective in two regards: the shallow drama and the far-fetched actions of the scientists on this glacial frontier. Characters have never been Carpenter's forte. He prefers to see us cardiac than see us concerned with the traits of his characters. This time, though, regardless of some pragmatic pigeonholing and some competent boilerplates like the Leader, the Screw-Loose and the Lush, he has occupied his ice station with people whose essential function in life is to be accosted from behind, which is all the more disappointing because he casts some really good character actors like Keith David and Wilford Brimley. The few scenes that foster actual drama are submerged by the scenes in which the men are mere trip wires for a blitz by the Thing.That brings us to the other problem, credibility. We know that the Thing tends to bide its time until a character is alone, and then ambush, consume and replicate him. Well, the first instinct against this quandary is a padlock buddy system, nevertheless, constantly, Carpenter lets his characters to ramble off alone and return with odd looks on their faces, until we're almost baffled as to who may have been contaminated and who hasn't. At the conclusion of the movie, the survivors ultimately happen upon another whom they all thought before had either died or been contaminated and imitated. Because it had been made clear earlier that the Thing rips through clothing, why their suspicion of whether or not this returning character is real as he is still wearing the same intact clothing as before? I guess one way to look at all this is the obstacle in the way of their survival: the human weakness of constant proclivity for conflict and suspicion keeping them from an obvious goal. But perhaps that takes more than simply letting them disregard the elephant in the room and devolve into slasher film robots.This ostensible remake is all in all a freak carnival, a make-you-sick movie in which kids on dates can giggle every time there's a scare. There's nothing wrong with that, especially since in that sense, it delivers well. I like being scared and I was scared by various moments in this film. It's readily apparent that Carpenter made his decision at the start to focus on the special effects and engineering and to let the story and people to be a side effect. Since this material has been done before, and to superior effect, as close in release period as Alien in fact, there's no requisite to see this paraphrase except if you are intrigued by what the Thing might look like while starting from slippery, unidentifiable innards then forcing out horrifyingly enormous crab legs and mutating itself into a dog. In which case, see it high.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good horror, but flawed. Others may have appreciated the film more, but those are not me. Recommended to fans of thriller, horror and gore movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It all seemed like a normal summer in the Antarctic Mountains, when all of a sudden; a strange man appears in a helicopter, trying to shoot down a dog with a machine gun. The scientists spending their time at the houses in the Antarctic shoot the offender. But, why was he shooting at the dog? Well, apparently some creature was unearthed from the ice (or something like that) and came to terrorize the humans. This is no ordinary creature though. It can change its shape into the victims that it has killed. (Does that make sense?) If it kills somebody, it can look like them, and possibly speak like them! It sounds pretty similar to the villain in Terminator 2: Judgment Day! Well, if you have heard of the monster, than it becomes way too obvious about why the man was shooting at the dog. But, don't worry. To counter the predictability of the first scene, "John Carpenter's The Thing" brings many moments that are, well? not as predictable. These are the good moments. These are also the moments when the audience suspects that one of the people was infected by the creature, and therefore, the audience is subjected to guessing who it is.While the film is fairly un-predictable, these moments have their flaws. The audience is left guessing whether the person is Childs, Blaire, Clark or somebody else. This would be nice if we actually knew who they were! The characters hardly stand out from one another, and there are just way too many of them! How is the audience supposed to follow? This leads to confusion, which also makes the film less enjoyable to me. Plus, every moment of thrill is way too short for my enjoyment. This adds to the displeasure as confusion and boredom invade my enjoyment.But, the moments of thrill, while short, are fun. No, they're not so thrilling that you hold you're breath and refuse to stop watching, but they are pretty fun. After all, it is directed by John Carpenter, who made Halloween and The Fog. If you are a hardcore fan of thriller and horror films, or a hardcore fan of gore films, you should probably pick this one up.7/10 Good: Thrilling movie, with nice twists here and there.Bad: Confusion, boredom, short thrills and way too many characters</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carpenter's dramatic masterpiece...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually mislabeled as a "horror" film, this is really a drama in science fictional clothing. The plot is really driven by the impact on the characters of an alien that can perfectly disguise itself as any organism it's come into contact with. Carpenter ratchets the paranoia and tension almost to the breaking point as the creature slowly destroys the entire crew of an Antarctic research station.As faithful to the original short story, "Who Goes There?" by legendary sf editor (and usually mediocre writer) John Campbell as the original movie was not, Carpenter's adaptation is a masterful study of humans under the most unbearable tension imaginable.The special effects retain their punch, 23 years later whilst the intense criticism they brought at the time (the movie opened two weeks after "E.T.; as Carpenter says, "ET was the good movie and we were the bad.") is no longer relevant in the post-9/11 world. We've all seen things far more horrible than anything ever conceived by Hollywood.The movie that got Carpenter labeled by one critic as a "pornographer" of violence" has stood the test of time; the now criticism but a footnote.None-the-less, they remain spectacular. The kennel scene is particularly astonishing. A later scene in which Dr. Copper (Richard Dysart) is killed is also a special effects marvel.Carpenter also treats us to breathtaking scenery (Alaska and British Columbia served as "Antarctica") of vast ice fields and glaciers.Kurt Russell also turns in one of his best performances. Forced to become the leader of the dwindling band of humans, his character MacCready displays the tough-mindedness of "Snake Pliskin" combined with a humanity the latter lacked. To be fair, the movie also lacks the humor that helped alleviate "Escape from New York's" violence and degradation.The entire cast does stellar work. Even the dog "actor" playing the alien turns in a great performance, never once looking at camera or crew in the scene's he's in. Russell and Carpenter also offer a funny, incisive and illuminating commentary on the 1998 "special edition." If you haven't seen this movie in years (it had been at least fifteen years for me) you'll be presently surprised how well everything holds up, from the special effects to the actor's performances, to Carpenter's directorial trademarks. Ennio Moricone's score fits Carpenter's style almost as well as one of Carpenter's scores. Low key and unobtrusive, it provides the perfect counterpoint and undertone to the intensity of the images and performance.Still not for the squeamish or the kiddies, if you like your sf, or horror, served up without the usual clichs or half-naked females helplessly waiting for the killer, then I definitely suggest this movie.As Carpenter proved he could master comedy with "Big Trouble in Little China", so with "The Thing" he proves he can handle deadly serious drama. The denunciations have faded with the paper they were printed on. 23 years later what's left is an excellent movie and special effects landmark.DVD Ratings: Transfer: 8 5.1 remix: 8 "Extras": 9 (for Carpenter/Russell commentary track; the "Special Edition" also contains a nearly 90 min documentary about the movie; also highly recommended.)Trivia tidbit: associate producer Larry Franco--who also plays one of the Norwegians at the beginning of the movie--was also, at the time, Kurt Russell's brother-in-law.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the thing is a FAR better movie adaption of the original John W Campbell Jr/Don A. Stuart story "Who Goes There?". Carpenter's film version actually FOLLOWS the original story (though in an updated 1980s setting), with the alien being a shape shifter that consumes its victim's cells and morphs and merges or splits into two. The 1951 version is a shallow adaption of the original story and has nothing of the creepiness and gracious gore of the original. What the hell is wrong with you people? The Thing a cheap alien knockoff? READ THE ORIGINAL STORY. good god. some people...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thing not as good as Alien</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Early Carpenter movies seem to find a particular niche and exploit them to their very best. I'm thinking of Assault on Precinct 13 (drama); The Fog (Ghost/thriller); Halloween (slasher/terror); Escape from New York (Sci Fi/thriller) and of course The Thing (Pure Horror);although ever since then he seems to have lost his magical touch. For a start, the original Thing from the 50s is a better movie because it relies on tension rather than out &amp; out gore. In addition The Thing has been compared to Alien, but again the latter film has the edge because the gore is limited to our imagination while focusing on what's-around-the-corner scenario.Having said that, the story &amp; characterisation are both very good. Russell seems to be enjoying himself as the anti-hero, more so than he did in the Escape films.Rob Bottin's special effects are truly amazing pre-CGI, and all the better for it. Although on the down side, I felt Ennio Morricone was the wrong choice to write the score - far too understated &amp; amateurish. Morricone works better with orchestral scores and not messing around on synthesizers and samplers.The ending too was poor. Too many loose ends and disappearing characters. Bit of an anti-climax for a Carpenter film then, but is still recommended especially in DVD with widescreen pro-logic.***/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like gore and explosions more than a clear story this one is for you. The techy talk was awfully fast and all that running through tunnels was a bit much. It was even hard to tell who was who what with the parkas and the beards and the yelling last names at one another without any clear introduction as to just who was which. They were looking for "Blair" and I thought that he was a totally different character.The opening shot with the helicopter and the dog were pretty cinematically impressive. The explosions and gore were also impressive BUT awfully repetitive. The only jump worthy scene was during the "blood tests". That actually got a "whoa !" reaction.Not a fan of this type of film and I did prefer the "original". EDIT: Re-watched the original just now and see that the Font for the TITLE was the same !

		<fullReview>The Thing is certainly a creature to fear. Its transformation capabilities yield it one of the strangest yet most powerful weapons introduced to the horror genre. The vulnerability of a population of any size certainly makes the Thing a being with infinite (chaotic) potential and one to hold in high regard.From the eerie soundtrack to sharp moments, The Thing certainly has the inner workings of a classic. Despite the great technical qualities, I was generally unmoved by the film. Although the oddity and atmosphere in the Antarctic was entertaining throughout, it was rather dull than pure excitement.The haunting and supernatural plot combined with the scary scenes and chilling vibrations surrounding every movement ensure a moment should not be missed. But alas, it was simply not a movie for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carpenter's first B movie on an A budget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's "The Thing" serves up not only a civilizational clash between aliens and mankind, but between Hollywood popcorn cinema and the cinema verite and neorealist movements of 1960s Europe. Such an odd blend resulted in many excellent horror films in the 1970s and early 80s, which mixed fantasy plots and big budget SFX with gritty realism and grungy characters.The film ? a loose remake of Howard Hawks' equally great "The Thing From Another World" - revolves around a group of men trapped in an ice station during a blizzard. To make matters worse, a shape shifting alien is hidden among them. Much paranoia, tension and violence ensues.Carpenter's special effects range from excellent to hokey, and he does dwell on them a bit too much, but his cast ? especially Kurt Russell in the lead ? are what really keeps us riveted.8/10 ? Like "Alien", this is essentially a peek-a-boo haunted house movie, Ridley Scott's lavish environments replaced with better characters, dialogue and arguably more tension. Like most films which rely on easy spooks, the film is a bit too shallow and schematic. Worth two viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a serious injection of pure paranoia. If you don't get anxious and ask important questions about what exactly happens that we don't get to see, and when, during the course of this, then you, my friend, were not properly engaged, and, let's be brutally honest here, this film probably wasn't meant for you(and hey, that's no problem, nothing is for everyone). A lot of debate is possible over the answers. And that's part of why this is so enormously terrifying, and what keeps this working for the audience, even with many viewings. It's difficult to be certain. The plot is marvelous, and its progression feels natural without being predictable. The concept is well-thought out, interesting and fascinating, and the execution does not disappoint. The pacing is spot-on, there is not a misplaced moment to be found in this. When this intends to be, it is rather intense. The atmosphere is expertly crafted, and builds at the proper speed, never rushed. The tension is so thick you can practically *see* it. The gore is plentiful, and while quite frightening, it isn't the point, nor does it ever feel like it is. And whether you like them or not, ya gotta admit, they look pretty darn good for when they were made. All the special effects in this do, almost entirely on account of Rob Bottin, the newcomer who literally exhausted himself creating them. The key is the balance, how far you push the shocks, and John's got that down to a science. The humor is of the same type and close to the same amount as his usual efforts. The acting is average or above. The characters are sufficiently developed and varied. The dialog is well-delivered and well-written. The mood is helped by the brilliant composer Ennio Morricone, who applies his talent, and puts together music that fits Carpenter perfectly. If your nerves are not in tattered rags before this is over... see the beginning of this review. All of these things together... the isolation of the people and the setting, the long, claustrophobic hallways, the genuinely successful scares, the gruesome violence and the haunting, unsettling score... it creates a strong horror piece which still holds up today, and which manages to get jumps out of yours truly, after having watched it around a dozen times. The DVD holds a feature-length behind-the-scenes documentary and a commentary track with Kurt Russell and the director, who are cool to listen to together, and which is both entertaining and informative. The menus are a tad flat, and one can tell that the release was done years after this hit theaters. I recommend this movie to fans of all that were involved in making it... in particular the man who helmed it. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am very disappointed in the fact that The Thing is not in the top 100 best movies. John Carpenter's best work, even better than Halloween. The Tjing is one of my favourite films, along with Brazil, Star Wars and Shinen No Samurai. The tension Carpenter builds up, and up, and up, until something terrifying happens, like someones head falling off, or a guy getting his hands eaten by a mouth in someones stomach. From beginning to end, it is a gripping film, starting with a strange chase in a helicopter, with Norwegiens attempting to kill a dog, to the end when MacReady and Childs sitting in the snow talking. The graphics are sick and twisted at the most pleasant moments, and that is the kind of thing I like. The only thing I disagree with is the dogs face splitting open. I am an animal lover, so I think that it should be them chasing a man instead of a dog, and that guy kills a load of scientists instead of slaughtering the huskies. Apart from that, it is a perfect movie, mixing horror, action, and gruesome graphics to make a film for any age (over 18, that is).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excellent sci-fi/horror movie. Many of today's movies don't compare with this in my mind.The setting is perfect--it wouldn't be nearly as scary in a desert or island--the arctic climate heightens the theme and tones of being stranded with no one you can trust.The special effects, although at times a bit cheesy, are very well done, especially for the year it was made (this is from the 80's, people, don't be so critical). The limits in special effect technology is the only thing that holds the movie back--if it were remade as well today, it would be a HUGE hit! (although Blair's computer shouldn't be changed a bit--man that was engrossing) I recommend this movie to ANYONE unless you're super-ly-afraid of any scary elements in movies (I cant watch most scary movies without a nightmare or two, but that didn't stop me). I showed this to all my friends, and they all loved it. And besides, if you're too stingy to buy it, at least rent it or watch it on HBO or Starz (I did today!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Thing" - Repressed homosexuality? or homophobia?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Spoilers*I must be the first person to post a review here for this film that is not hero-worshipping it.First of all, I must say, it was a very well cut film, and the sense of mood it created, whether deliberate or accidental was very effective. The unspectacular, minimal eerie score was just right for adding to the feeling of cold and isolation in the film.But I'm quite puzzled at the cult status this film has achieved over the years. The effects were supposedly quite revolutionary for their time, though I didn't think they were anything more than 50's schlock horror effects with a bigger budget. By today's standards, the effects are downright cheesy and I found myself chuckling rather than chucking at them. Indeed, the sense of suspense was well built up, and the plot mostly consisted of "who will die next, and what disgusting way will it happen?". This is sufficient motivation for the characters in the film, and though there wasn't much character development, I suppose it wouldn't have been worth it as they would just die by the time you got to know them.But overall, the film was reasonably average. What's all the fuss about?Finally - I could go into this at some length if I had the energy, but I couldn't help notice the film being a metaphor for repressed homosexuality, or men's attitudes towards homosexuality among their own ranks."The Thing" is fear, repression; "Does he have the thing? What if _I_ get the thing? Everyone will want to KILL me if I get The Thing! Maybe if I try to KILL the Thing, they'll think I don't have it!"I thought maybe I was reading too far into this, you could apply any primal fears to the thing, but what did it for me was three things (!). Firstly, there are NO women in the film!!! Why? It was totally possible, in fact likely that there would be women on the base, but they are noticeably absent. Secondly,the ending, where only Kurt Russell's and one other character are left alive, around a fireplace (burning debris). Perhaps it was poor acting, but there was warmth in their characters, and the final words uttered were to the effect of "What do we do now?", to which Russell answers "Well let's just see what happens.". And finally. The tagline for the film : "Man is the warmest place to hide".Hmmmmmmm. Eh? No doubt hundreds of angry fans will send me evil hate mail, it's just an opinion. I did think it was an entertaining film. Honest. :)</fullReview>

I thought it was worth watching at the time. I now own this on DVD and it was good to pass the time with a film I had forgotten about.The film itself wasn't scary as such, it was slightly creepy and very gory. The gory scenes do shock, but it was a pity the horror aspect doesn't so much, but it does stir up a good dose of suspense. Kurt Russell does give an excellent portrayal of a guy slightly on the edge but of one who can take leadership, and I could really get into his character. The other characters I felt could have been developed more, but in fairness the film gets straight to the plot and keeps it up.The cinematography is OK, with good use of fading from certain scenes, and the score is simple and creepy. I must mention that it has good effects for a movie of that time. Go for it, watch it ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting...but not brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an interesting film, mainly because it is one filled with some of the most disgusting special effects I have ever seen - though I admit that I am fairly new to horror flicks of this kind.What's good about it? For one thing, it is a very clever touch not to reveal who has been infected and who hasn't until it is absolutely necessary. It is completely impossible to tell who is who, and the suspense raises sky-high because of that.Also, the performances are actually pretty good, considering the cramped confinement of the set and the sparse and somewhat lame dialogue. These are ordinary men talking, though most of them seem to be more or less criminal in some way.The beginning is very clever, and it takes quite a while before one gets the hang of why these crazy Norwegian are so eager to hunt the dog with machine guns and hand grenades (!) that they injure one of the Americans in the process. Of course, the first time I saw it, I knew what was coming, but it makes it better nonetheless.I have a favorite scene in this movie, it is one I will remember forever: when the doctor is trying to resuscitate one of the team members, who has been infected, he gets his hands caught in some weird mouth that opens right in the guy's chest. That is awful. It doesn't matter much that the doc's hands seem to break off by themselves...What else? Well...it's a cult classic, and deserves it. Like many of those, it's very far from brilliant, but are nonetheless very good and entertaining to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE THING (1981) **** Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, Richard Dysart, Richard Masur, TK Carter, Keith David, David Clemmon, Donald Moffat. John Carpenter's gory special effects laden remake of the sci-fi classic offers an alien parasite wreaking havoc at an Antarctic American scientific camp in the middle of no-man's land with Russell as the cocksure chopper pilot facing paranoia and death everywhere he turns. Waycool make-up effects by Rob Bottin (remember this was pre-CGI! - All practical effects that criminally did NOT nominate him for an Oscar) and an eerie score by Ennio Morricone. One of the best 're-imaginings' ever perfectly set to paranoia and 'plague' phobia; one of my all-time faves!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What you fear most.. is among you"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long story short: I had large expectations for this film. It's been coined one of the scariest films of all time. The Shining and Exorcist are also coined the same thing, which are actually scary. It had a great plot. I loved the whole mystery thing it had going on, not knowing what 'it' is. And it was made by John Carpenter. He's the director who has created the iconic character of Michael Myers and made the classic horror film. So with all these added up, I was really excited to see what was to come. It had all these things that had it coming, but here's the biggest shocker: it was horrible. The Thing has all the components of a horror film, and the strangest thing is that it uses them, but for what reason? So the beginning was done fantastic. My expectations were huge, kept me wondering what this film could do. Ready to be scared off my seat. But maybe my expectations were too high.. Carpenter thinks he can create an eerie feeling throughout the entire thing, which he's half right/half wrong. The sense of paranoia IS there, but it just dies down every time something happens. Carpenter also takes the gimmicky effect of gore itself, and uses it to make these far-fetched images, that he thinks will scare us, but then comes off a bit silly. One scene was this guys turn into some crawling creature, which way back in 1982 would surely look stupid. And it does. And Carpenter's vision of aliens itself are just absurd. I imagine aliens as short, green fellows with one eye and a laser gun; the stereotypical vision of them. Carpenter thinks they are shape-shifting guys that we never get to see. And that's the problem with me. Carpenter uses the gimmick to not show the aliens, which sort of comes of as a mixture of stupid and curiosity, but for me? I sat in half-confusion, half-bored. There was no sense of tension between the characters, and the slow-burn pacing never helped either. So I wouldn't recommend The Thing. It's cracked up to be one of the greatest horror films of all time, but it never ever shows this. It's was boring, slow, pointless, and tension-less. It's not even one of those horror films that you want to watch with your friends, because all you would be doing is watching the gross-out scenes that seamlessly go nowhere. If you loved Halloween, and hate the gimmicky effect of gore, The Thing will be hated by you. If you hate Halloween, love gore, love horror movies that come out today, then this is your sort of film. I didn't like it, my opinion, my fact. The end.4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was about time I watched this movie again. I was 12 when I first saw it and it scared the living hell out of me. Ever since then I'm careful when I see a Hushky...John Carpenter's version of the "Who Goes There" story is fascinating, scary and pretty gore at several times but it surely is highly recommended. The creepy atmosphere is unique and very few movies equal to it or even come close. The Thing is some sort of Alien monster that has been safely frozen for the last 100.000 years but now it has thawed. That's the fault of a few Norwegian guys...In the form of a innocent looking dog, the thing ends up in an American Station. This is the greatest power of the enemy. It's fully capable to take over any life form and therefore it's hard to detect. And ... even more importantly ... it doesn't take long before anyone can be trusted. Everyone could in fact be "The Thing" This rather simple - but at the same time original and innovative - aspect about the enemy allows the story to create a unique claustrophobic atmosphere. First of all, you have the isolated landscape of the Antarctic Circle. The groups ' space to run and hide is very limited since it's unbearably cold and there are lots of storms. Secondly, the Thing to itself is very unpredictable. The tension between the characters can almost be smelled by the viewer and I think that's Carpenter biggest achievement about this movie. Although, there ain't much dialog in this film , you're kept close to the screen in order not to miss anything. Basically, Carpenter does pretty much the same as in his other horror classic Halloween. Although this is a complete different plot and complete different setting, there's not a message to detect, no psychological undertone or no form of humanity what so ever. Just a raw battle to survive between a bunch of tough men.And last but certainly not least ... some credit for the special effects and make-up department. This crew is just brilliant and pretty explicit for the 80's if you ask me. They managed to visualize a perfectly scary looking creature. Several shocking scenes will haunt your head long after you've seen this movie. Don't matter if you're a hardened horror fan already or not, but the images of a splitting dog and a human head marching on spider legs won't leave you senseless. Excellent Class A horror. Also worth a mention: the subtle but memorable score by Ennio Morricone... Highly recommend to all film-fans, a must see for horror freaks. The original version from 1951 is highly recommended as well. Lovely 50's SciFi-movie, that is !!Favorite "rewind"-scene : The Doctor desperately tries to save a crew-member and prepares himself to give him a heart-massage. At the moment that his hands touch the guy's chest, it splits open and grabs the doctor with filthy looking teeth ...Enjoy !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I swear I thought "The Thing" was a thousand times scarier than "Alien". The orginal movie is kind of boring. It's a classic, but this is one of those rare occasions the remake is needed. Besides the awesome effects, the acting is phenominal. Kurt Russell is amazing. How everyone just turns against each other was so natural. The make up was incredable. I couldn't believe that this movie was made in 1982. I think "The Thing" is very under rated in it's 7.8 star status. I think it should be higher. Maybe even reach up to the top 250. I'm not kidding, I loved "The Thing". I would recommend it.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Nice To See Carpenter Knows How To Remake Something Besides Rio Bravo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's remake of the Howard Hawkes production of The Thing From Another World FLOPPED in 1982. I thought the failure lay with screenwriter Bill Lancaster whose limited experience included The Bad News Bears Go To Japan. Carpenter did a fair job filming the extensive practical special effects which was the real star of this show. An alien organism is discovered frozen in a block of ice but emerges and is capable of mimicking any organism. This leaves plenty of opportunity for the make up department to cut loose and let their imaginations run wild. The Thing was the Citizen Kane of make up special effects films and eventually found a cult of horror fans. Unfortunately the decades have not been kind to those once state-of-the-art FX as the more polished CG has dominated the medium since the 90s. The Thing is occasionally scary despite the shortcomings created by the badly aging effects work. And it's great to see Carpenter try his hand at remaking something other than Rio Bravo. Nominated for a Razzie for worst musical score. Followed by a prequel in 2011.</fullReview>

The opening scene of the dog being shot at from the helicopter clues you in to the fact that this is a very disturbing movie. I do not care for the insipid dialog or plot line, with dogs and people tuning into disgusting, morphing monsters. I don't care for the plot twist of everyone the in the movie being suspected of possible contamination, in danger of becoming monsters themselves. The special effects were terrifying and excessively gory. I want to see different horror movies that are much more entertaining than this piece of crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far better than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thing is that rarest of beasts, a remake that is far better than the original. The film opens with the crew of an American Arctic research centre rescuing a dog from some deranged members of a European party who die, before it can be established why they are trying to kill the canine. Upon investigation it appears the remaining members of the European crew are dead, some of them horribly mutilated. The research centre has also been burnt down.The Americans take the dog in. This is where the trouble starts. Slowly the centre is been taken over, equipment is being sabotaged and people are being killed but by who? The `who' is the `Thing' in question a being that can assume the forms of others. Kurt Russell stars as Macreedy a helicopter pilot determined to find out. The film also has an array of character actors all destined for gory deaths including Richard Dysart (guy for LA Law), Donald Moffat, Keith David and most menacing of all Wilford Brimley. Whilst the film is primarily remembered for its excellent special effects, In my opinion these are actually the weakest part of the film. The strongest part being the claustrophobia heightened by the conditions (they are in the middle of an arctic storm) and the paranoia of not knowing who can be trusted. The scene where a test is being administered to determine who is the `Thing' is incredible. Kurt Russell is excellent as Macreedy demonstrating an understandable edginess, paranoia and vulnerability. The rest of the cast too is excellent in their portrayals of suspicion, fear and terror.The music is suitably creepy, although it seems to me a bit strange in hiring Ennio Morricone to effectively imitate a John Carpenter score. What's the point when you have Carpenter at the helm of the film anyway?The film itself was dismissed when it was released at around about the same time as ET. I suppose people weren't ready to see a film about a nasty alien. In retrospect the film is getting the recognition it deservesJohn Carpenter's finest hour, no I'd say it was Assault on precinct 13. However it is one of the most effective chillers you will ever see.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You think that thing wanted to be an animal? No dogs make it a thousand miles through the cold! No, you don't understand! That thing wanted to be US!"I'm definitely going to see the upcoming remake of The Thing (Mary Elizabeth Winstead, 'nuff said) so I thought that it would be wise to see the 80's remake (the original movie came out in the 50's) before hand. And I'm glad I did. It may be a little dated by today's standards, but it's still a solid exercise in paranoia-fueled monster movies.An isolated Antarctic research station on the cusp of polar winter becomes a battleground for a handful of people and a terrifying alien. One that has a unique ability that quickly causes the humans to not be able to trust one another. They have to remain on the lookout for danger from their fellow humans, as well as the creature.&nbsp;The two aspects of The Thing that are most worthy of mention are the gory and impressive special effects, and the believable tension between the actors as they realize that there is no one they can trust but themselves. The creature design for the Thing truly is memorable, and if you have an aversion to copious amount of blood or tentacles, this will be a nightmare for you. The dynamics between the characters is what most of the story focuses on, and without that, this would just be a mindless movie about people being killed. But instead, it almost becomes a race between the viewer and the characters to figure out who is a threat and who (if anyone) might survive this whole thing. Pretty cool.I think if you're a fan of movies like Alien, you'll like this. It doesn't quite have the timelessness of that movie, and it's not quite as frightening, but there's a similar vibe that the two share. If the upcoming remake is at least as good as this one, it'll be worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter's "Thing" Is No "Halloween"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The man who showed the world how scary a movie he could make with nothing more than a shoestring budget ("Halloween" in 1978) demonstrates that less can be more when it comes to making a horror movie that will truly scare you.John Carpenter gets quite a bit more money to throw at the screen and uses it to create all kinds of nifty makeup and creature effects in his 1982 cult classic "The Thing," but it's the movie's quiet early scenes, before anything much is actually happening, that are the most unsettling."The Thing" isn't exactly a remake of the 1951 classic "The Thing from Another Planet," though it shares the source material of that film. It's a reinvention and is largely better than the earlier version. Kurt Russell and a group of scientists working at the North Pole become prey to a shape-shifting alien that has the ability to look just like any one of them, and the real tension in the film comes from the mens' increasing inability to trust one another -- after all, who's an alien and who isn't? This adds an effective punch of psychological complexity that was missing from the 1950s version, which presented itself as a straight-up monster movie. In John Carpenter's version, the paranoia and claustrophobia that develops from being trapped in your own worst nightmare are as scary as any of the oogie-boogies running around in the snow.But the film relies too much on its gross-out effects, which no doubt looked state-of-the-art in 1982, but which look silly and dated now. Carpenter didn't take to heart the lesson he taught audiences in 1978 -- that a person's imagination is going to cook up something ten times scarier than anything a filmmaker can actually show you on screen.This is a worthy addition to the horror canon, but its quality has been overrated by fanboys.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I had forgotten how brilliant this movie actually is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It had been quite some years since I had last seen this movie and the earlier brilliant and fresh movie version "The Thing from Another World" from 1951 was more fresh on my mind. I think I can say that "The Thing" is actually even a better movie. It's a great horror with a touch of science-fiction.To put it boldly, this movie is like "Alien", only set at the Antarctic. It has the same sort of atmosphere, build up, look and of course a killer alien on the loose. However this is not an "Alien" clone. The movie is just too good for that to call it one.I think I can say that this is one of the most paranoid movies ever made. It's actually quite easy to make a good and effective horror movie once you know to create a certain level of paranoia into the movie. In this movie you just never known who the alien is, which makes you very uncertain of things and makes you literally trust no one or his motivations throughout the movie. With this given element the movie knows to build up a great tension and atmosphere for the movie. It's horror elements mostly gets feed from these elements and it's what makes "The Thing" such a superior and classic movie within its genre.You really have to give John Carpenter credit for this movie. He has done lots of classic horror movies throughout his career but this one perhaps is his most brilliant one. He builds up the movie extremely well and very effectively. What also helps with this are Ennio Morricone's moody musical score (while normally Carpenter composes the music himself for all of his movies) and the camera-work from later Oscar-nominee Dean Cundey. Why doesn't he do horror movies anymore? Now days he mostly makes bright looking, happy movies, while in the past he did the camera-work for some fine and classic horror flicks, including "The Fog" and "Halloween", which also got directed by John Carpenter.It's also a quite gory movie to watch. The still at the time very young Rob Bottin did a very good job with all of its make-up effects. Some truly gory and unexpected things are happening throughout this movie, so know what to expect.It also knows to remain a realistic movie throughout, even though it of course doesn't feature a very likely main plot. It's because of its directing handling, acting and its writing that the movie works out that way.The movie doesn't feature many characters and also no big names playing them, except for Kurt Russell of course. This also keeps the movie realistic and keeps all characters on the same level. It helps for the atmosphere of the movie, since you also don't know who is going to die next and where and how. It increases also the overall paranoid feeling of the movie.A brilliant classic atmospheric genre-piece!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. Of the near 400 reviews on IMDB, I'm only one of about four or five who didn't go for this. Sure the effects are mind-blowing and the score's pretty good, but so much more was needed. Start with the pace. In between some pretty good scares and gore, are painful lulls that drag forever. The set-up is intrigueing, but then goes on too long. Later it's far too much talking that does the film in, "Is it you or you or you or...". An unidentified "thing" happens upon an unidentified research team to inexplicably devour them from within. Tack on one of the biggest loose ends in film history, and you've got a plethora of annoying unanswered questions. And of course this is better than the original. That film came out in 1951, far from the advances of Rob Bottin's awesome transformation effects. But that's all this has going for it, and that's not enough to recommend this Thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rate this Sci-Fi/Alien Invasion movie 5 stars solely on the merits of its gooey, fantastically over-the-top monster-effects that were artfully created by brilliant effects-wizard, Rob Bottin.Man, Bottin really outdid himself this time with some of the most wild and grotesquely imaginative alien assimilation sequences ever seen in a pre-CGI horror picture. The awesome "blood test" scene was the absolute best of all.This movie only comes to life when Bottin's excellent handiwork is the focus of the action. Without his cool creations The Thing, under John Carpenter's lame direction, just sucked.It would be an understatement to say that this picture has lost a lot of its initial clout over the past 35 years.As well, none of the characters were at all likable, especially Kurt Russell's MacReady, who was nothing but a suck, a drunk, and a sore-loser who couldn't stand to be beaten in a game of chess by his computer-opponent.I thought that this film's opening sequence with the Norwegians (flying in a helicopter) repeatedly attempting to shoot down an escaped husky and missing their target every time (even though the dog was an easy target), was one of the most pathetic "hot pursuit" scenes ever captured in a big-budget horror movie.Boo! Hiss! to John Carpenter for dishing up this kind of crap.</fullReview>

It's only fault is the execution of the effects. I know this impressed the **** out of people back in the 80's, but as a 90's guy I have to say, it's not that scary. There is never any interaction between the cast and the alien (except for when the doctor looses his hands, that part doesn't make sense btw., why does the replicant suddenly collapse?) Sure, the ones infected/taken over/copied must have interacted with it, but every time the alien shows itself it never does anything. It's just there, as if its gross appearance and sounds would be enough. It almost is, but... Some will say "sacrilege!" but I say go-go remake.Ps.: Watch the much underrated movie Phantoms from '98 for a better "amorph"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first say this movie on a projection screen at a Take 1 arcade in the early 80's. Can't believe I saw it uncut, either. Perhaps the owners felt the sound from Battlezone and Pac Man would drown out the profanity from young ears. At the time, I certainly found it frightening, but with time, and repeated viewings, I have to wonder about some of the director's choices. Could someone *please* explain to me why a civilian research station is heavily armed with firearms, not to mention flamethrowers? I mean, c'mon, I can understand maybe a shotgun, but flamethrowers? Were penguins that much of a threat to their survival?Yes, the original "Thing" from 1951 may not have the gore and body count, but you can't beat the fact that they were lightly armed, even for military personnel, and had to use what was at hand to battle the creature. Here, whatever they need is thrown their way. It's hard to beat the orignal folks fighting off the creature with buckets of kerosene and flare guns in a confined space. If Carpenter really wanted to impress me, he would have done away with the firepower and focused more on a group of lightly/unarmed scientists improvising their survival as in the earlier film.</fullReview>

More Fangoria is not necessarily needed to evoke chills in a good horror film and Carpenter knows better. Even his minimalist music that is usually so eerie garners very little emotion because it is overwhelmed by all of the ugliness. The cast and atmosphere suffer the same situation frozen out of the melodrama by a barrage of excess baggage. The popularity and cult following of this film is due mainly because of the strong fan-base of the Director. This is not one of his best.A lot of explosions and a very lame ending.</fullReview>

This big-budget remake of the 1951 film proves that bigger isn't better, marred by poor acting, directing, and script. Carpenter thinks that slimy creatures and graphic mutilations are entertaining, but it's just disgusting. There is no subtlety at work here. This film has parallels to "The Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (the original) and "Alien," but one of the reasons it falls far short of those landmark sci-fi classics is that there's little build-up of suspense.

		<shortDescription>Carpenter does his own thing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's remake of The Thing From Another World has divided the opinions of sci-fi/horror fans ever since its original release: the film was a box office failure, panned by the critics, primarily for its bleak, emotionless content and over-reliance on excessive violence and gore, but has since been declared by many as a classic for the very same reasons. Judging by the comments here on IMDb, the debate still rages...As far as Carpenter's storytelling is concerned, I'm kinda pitched between the two camps: there are some very effective scenes in which the director successfully creates an Alien-style atmosphere of paranoia, mistrust and fear between his increasingly desperate characters; and there are some equally dumb-as-a-box-of-rocks moments that simply defy logic, particularly as the film reaches its poorly conceived and annoyingly inconclusive climax.What is undeniable, however, is that The Thing does deliver some of the most spectacular and gloopy gross-out make-up effects in the history of horror cinema, and for that reason alone, the film makes my 'recommended viewing' list. Devised by FX wizard Rob Bottin, the incredible metamorphic creatures that burst onto the screen in the film's show-stopping scenes of visceral horror are quite breath-taking, and to this day, these physical effects easily hold their own against contemporary CGI movie magic.Oh, and Dean Cundey's cinematography is pretty damn good too.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a definite chill in the air (in more ways than one)...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True to his name, John Carpenter was a major architect of celluloid terror in his prime, with a distinctive visual style, a reliance on simple musical scores that stick menacingly in the viewer's mind, and a manner of manipulating suspense through lighting, character conflict, and well-choreographed action. As both writer (often under a pseudonym) and director, Carpenter's films comprise some of the finest examples of the horror genre. However, when he's in command of someone else's script, there is sometimes a clash between the two. Upon viewing "The Thing" for the first time in several years, this inconsistency sticks out like a sore thumb.Now don't get me wrong. As a child I'd build my schedule (at least on weekends) around horror movies playing on cable TV, and Carpenter's interpretation of "The Thing" (far more faithful to the short story 'Who Goes There?' than its 1951 predecessor) was certainly a major influence on my personal taste--it was bloody, scary, and very cool-looking (Rob Bottin's makeup FX put all the CGI offerings that have come since to shame). And that minimalist score by Italian composer Ennio Morricone produced a shiver without fail. And the ending--from its ambiguous final line to the isolated manner in which it's photographed, was enough to thoroughly creep me out as a youngster.The movie still holds up for a lot of the reasons I just mentioned, but it falters somewhat due to the weak characterizations. Bill Lancaster's script renders the dozen or so men stationed at an Antarctic research outpost (a gaggle of scientists and military types) besieged by an imitative alien life form as little more than fodder for the cool-looking transformation/death scenes (that is, when they're not tossing explanatory dialog around like a hot potato). The isolated setting in the midst of a section of the world known for extreme weather conditions casts a weariness and desperation over the whole film, which would have been more effective if we gave a damn about the characters.Carpenter does what he can, and certain actors shine (such as future Quaker Oatmeal spokesman Wilford Brimley as a crazed doctor and David Clennon as a wisecracking pothead), but most of the cast comes off as nondescript as the alien life form itself. While mostly exposition, the dialog does unravel in an intriguing way as the men become increasingly aware of what they're dealing with, and the special effects complement the story rather than overwhelming it. And perhaps "The Thing"'s main saving grace--in terms of its horror being so well-preserved after all these years--is Carpenter's uncanny way of capturing a mood of dread, fear, and isolation, to the point where you might be tempted to jack up the thermostat a few degrees after the end credits are done rolling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to watch this movie with an expectation of seeing a masterpiece, but the film went far from it. The film missed several opportunities to take a course that would be far more interesting than it was, the actors were not well, some phrases defied the intelligence of the viewer, for example when the conversation might already have finished the doctor says to the other "we stopped before it ended" and the guy asks, "finish what?" the answer is obvious, unnecessary question .. Also the fact that "the thing" to copy the cell from the other so quickly, that would be impossible in real life, it would take at least a few days to be able to copy it completely. Anyway, I have serious problems with this film, score: 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Antarctica, date 1982, Outpost 31 for the US National Science Foundation, is called to arms by the rude invasion of a helicopter piloted by crazed Norwegians aboard armed to the teeth from a neighboring camp a hundred or so miles away. They are carrying out a mission to blow one of their own sled dogs to kingdom come that's currently due inbound. Cue Wagner's Flight Of The Valkyries.Well, these Norwegians are wussies. First it is revealed they have lost their minds during the first week of winter only after two months spent at their base camp but they can't shoot worth their water either.It is obvious they pursued their dog for miles from base camp over level, expansive snow and clear skies never managing to inflict a single scratch upon the animal. (Recall the words of Bennings "an hour there, an hour back" before Copper and Mac left to investigate the Norwegian camp.) Scoped semi-automatic assault rifles firing supersonic bullets, box of grenades, and a hovering helicopter capable of airspeeds upwards of 130-150 mph all fails to stop this dog. The Nords had game and should have enjoyed the proverbial kerosene bonfire and been back before dinner. No matter, relating to a future incident in the movie.But these, Norwegians are scientists, we learn, so what do they know? The terrifying secret about the dog, desperately they do.That is just the beginning of the flaws inherent to The Thing.The movie is the second and more faithful adaptation of "Who Goes There?" a 1938 John W Campbell Jr novella about scientists stationed in the Antarctica that uncover a buried spacecraft and a virtually frozen live hostile alien that can assume any identity of any victim it digests.In JC's version, Outpost 31 is run by a loose crew of 12 men, namely scientists, doctors, pilots, mechanics, a radio operator, a dog handler, and a cook. The story takes places over three days and three nights. Once the members of Outpost 31 learn their new canine guest that very same evening is not what it appears to be, a tidal wave of fear and distrust amongst themselves soon engulfs the whole camp for the same reason after their scientists learn the true nature of this alien menace and the frightening implications it presents to the whole population of Earth abroad.They've been out of radio contact two weeks and good old natural paranoia builds in this barren isolated microcosm where no one trusts anyone anymore. Their situation motions from grim to even worse when they lose their radio and the copter to one of their doctors whom went over the bend and they're forced to lock him up in the tool shed outside under heavy sedation. Meanwhile, the alien goes to work either assimilating or killing the crew members off one-by-one or vice versa. The coffee pot is on the burner, a bloody sleepless attrition has begun. A hypothetical solution how to identify their alien perpetrator is finally agreed upon by blood test which leads into the movie's best moments during the long third climatic night.Where The Thing consistently misfires is the fact, the suspense is poorly executed, too reliant upon a smrg?sbord of gross-out special effect wizardry provided by Rob Bottin for shock rather than playing more upon the audience's imaginations for scares. A limp cast provides lackluster underdeveloped alien fodder without an ounce of sympathetic qualities. It would benefit if I actually cared about these characters thereby partook in their helpless terror. But sadly I don't. Every scene and nearly every line of dialogue is suffused with acid resentment, sarcasm, or condescension. Outpost 31 spares viewers of any warmth, any camaraderie amongst courageous human endeavor, and any heroes... Carpenter proceeds to fill every slot in the cylinders with mean getting nastier cyphers then mechanically pulls both triggers. No, the real hero is the alien itself the remaining real actors are an inevitable foaming mad beast, hamstrung and bleeding to death. The constant tension and grudging social pockets amongst these Americans at Outpost 31 is evident they were already on the verge a Chernobyl meltdown, thing or no thing. Their unexpected visitor only triggered it. Then I clap and cheer when the credits finally roll.Some reasons instrumental to my sentiments is 1) no emotional investment in any of the characters 2) it telegraphs all it's terror moments. Viewers know when something is going to happen because the movie takes the audience by the hands... walking them through it.Final notes, the amazing score of Ennio Morricone provides the proper downbeat atmosphere. The Thing proved capable of superhuman feats and genius throughout the movie chiefly displayed during the insurmountable task of engineering an underground workshop and one incomplete spacecraft furnished from the remains of Mac's helicopter and other flotsam jetsam lying about in less than two or three days. Survivor of unknown worlds. The Thing survived beneath the Antarctic ice for 100s of thousands of years. A creature with a nature so ingenious and alien, it can perfectly assimilate any other lifeforms in matter of mere moments right down to every quirk and eccentricity and minute detail in brilliant natural mimicry to be entirely unidentifiable from the original. How difficult can 12 grizzled, snowbound, isolated, and grumpy lonely men be, eh?PS In reality international law forbids flamethrowers and weapons caches such as found in Outpost 31.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thing (1982)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter is probably the horror genre's single most famous export. I think the reason why, other than the fact that he built his career with a couple highly successful low budget horror films at the box office (Halloween and The Fog), is because those films had his name all over the advertisements. You knew it was a John Carpenter film when you went to see it. But any biography of John Carpenter reads a little funny when you consider how big a name he is in the genre, because shortly after those films were so successful, his 1982 epic The Thing absolutely tanked at the box office. Things didn't get much better for him following that. Neither 1983's Christine, 1984's wonderful Starman, nor 1986's Big Trouble in Little China did any better. I'll bet Universal was having greater luck when they acquired the rights to the sequels for Halloween. Though even there, Part III: Season of the Witch most likely didn't make too much more than John's remake of The Thing. Though some say it's not even a remake, but a more faithful adaptation of the original story, Who Goes There?Now, that's a scary concept. Not knowing who is around you, as well as whether or not they're human. I'll admit to the world (apparently full of fans of this movie), this is a scary enough idea. But almost all the actual scariness is drained right out of the film by Carpenter's love for old-movie clichs. Literally, there are pieces from science fiction, western, and action films plastered all over The Thing. I like my horror a lot more pure than this. I don't get excited when I see scenes that are clearly being shot and added into the film for the purpose of watching someone sling-shoot a gun, or argue over who should be in charge, or smoke a joint, or drink a bottle of whiskey. I'm almost instantly reminded of Jaws, the big Hollywood adventure / drama that many people think is a horror film. The Thing is still a horror film, but my reason for bringing it up is there is an equal sense that much of Jaws is about "good ol' boys" and their dramatic situations and conflicts. But, this is horror. Why should I care just because that's the attitude of older military or western films? I sat down wanting a horror film.Okay, so The Thing isn't pure. And it's not that scary, either. I'm in my mid-20's, I'm probably not going to be too scared by 99% of all horror films anyway. The film has a few undeniable good qualities. John Carpenter is a visual master of the genre, so his films always look amazing. This one is no exception. 1980's The Shining and 1974's Black Christmas had already captured the creepiness and starkness of being somewhat isolated in winter conditions. But, The Thing is much colder. Credit to Carpenter for managing to get some real dread from the viewer about potentially being in the characters' position and possibly freezing to death in the incredibly cold Antarctic climate. The film is literally a harsh snowy desert, which Carpenter at times paints with red and blue light. Not as pretty as Argento's 1977 masterpiece Suspiria, but I'll take it. Ennio Morricone's score for the film has its' moments and sounds like Morricone trying to imitate Carpenter's previous scores somewhat, or the style of them. But overall, it's not nearly as effective as Carpenter's scores for Halloween or The Fog.And now, comes the part I always dread when talking about The Thing... Rob Bottin's special effects. The film's characters already do a good job of making this stylish film boring, but Rob's effects slam the book on why I dislike this film shut. They turn what is hopefully a restrained and tight paranoia piece into an out-and-out freakshow, like a circus of oddities. Which does not do much to add to any mood of suspense Carpenter was hoping to achieve. They stop the movie dead in its' tracks (though as I pointed out in another review, that's a Carpenter specialty), which I almost never care for. Bottin's work in Joe Dante's films previous, The Howling and Piranha, was flawed only because of the low budgets, but Bottin's and Dante's usage of them was remarkable and skilled. In The Thing, like I said, it's freaky and grotesque. Which I do think will knock your socks off if you're seeing the film for the first time. But will never scare you on repeat viewing. Rather, the sequences are just so disgusting, they make you want to turn the film off. Unless you're a budding special effects artist, who I'm sure will want to study every frame.However, I will admit that one sequence definitely still gets me and I am impressed (after seeing the film about six times to date), the spider-head sprouting legs. But for me, the quality of the special effects are never as important as how they are used. Too much is actually too much. John would go on to show much more restraint and skill in this area 5 years later with Prince of Darkness. A film that's nowhere near as good as The Thing, but used special effects to better overall effect. When the big effects scenes in The Thing are pretty much over, the film gets a lot more interesting. For example, the famous "blood test" scene is a total home run for Carpenter and company (shy of the stupid effects), but afterward, the film actually becomes beautifully eerie, dark, and very enjoyable. When MacReady and a few survivors are walking through the camp, discovering Blair's secret, and making final plans. This is what the entire film should have been like. No scene previous really made this film. But this ending is actually on par with Carpenter's earlier and excellent work in the horror genre.</fullReview>

It comes from director John Carpenter who otherwise has an excellent track record. The worst mistake that this movie made was wasting an excellent task- they are not really given a chance to act, instead, they grimace at all the (fantastic) special effects.

(As a side note, he doesn't even sound like he's talking Norwegian.) So is the computer "simulation" calculating the risk that one of the members in the expedition is infected, and how many hours until the entire world population is wiped out.I rented it to be scared, but there wasn't a moment that I was scared or even excited.I give the team credits for the special effects, but that doesn't make up for an uninteresting story and the above-mentioned laughable parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter's cult classic about Antarctic scientists led by Kurt Russell battling a space-shifting alien which is able to take on the appearance of the people it kills. Typical monster-that-would-not-die shtick in the tradition of Ridley Scott's "Alien" of 1979 as we have a whole host of character actors (led by Wilford Brimley, Keith David, and Donald Moffat, among others) trying to survive seemingly insurmountable odds. Jolts of energy come only sporadically with long mixtures of would-be suspense and unfortunately boredom as well. Good for a few campy laughs and mild shock values, "The Thing" in the end does little to separate itself from literally dozens of other films of the kind. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Don't Get The Hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply put, I just don't get all the hype surrounding this movie. To me it seemed a lot like Alien (1979). The plot was similar with an seemingly dead alien species coming to life and killing off a crew. While the time period and setting were different they were still both in a harsh just as unrelenting environment. The movie wasn't bad but it just wasn't that great either. The creature effects weren't that impressive and seemed pretty typical of other films from in and around the era. It all looked a little aged and overdramatic but is better than most from the 80's. If you consider the drastic circumstances that the characters were in and their inability to trust a single solitary soul, they didn't seem as intense or rivaled as they should have been. It was slightly dull when the situation should have been full of excitement. I have seen a couple of John Carpenter directed films being Big Trouble in Little China (1986) and They Live (1988) and I think I enjoyed them more. The Thing was a much more well made movie and it wasn't as cheesy as the other two or full of stupid one-liners and laughable action. The serious mood to the movie was more fitting, but it failed to exhilarate or thrill me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie I somehow avoided seeing for a while. Turns out my gut feeling was right, because this movie is just not good.I'm glad this genre kinda died out. We have seen this too many times. And the graphics are .. well.. this is a 1982 movie..So, the movie itself, starts of kinda slow, but very intriguing. Once that "the thing" is introduced, we get into all the charades about who is infected, who is not, surprises, kills, etc..Like I said before if that were my first time taking this kinda ride, I probably would've been impressed. But, as it is, it's just like, wow, so they did that back in 1982... cool. Good for them. Props.I have to give them credit for sure, and that is why I gave in 5/10 stars. But I really disliked this movie a lot.I guess the only reason I would recommend it just so you can cross it off the list. Which is a terrible reason. I'm also not a horror fan.I can definitely see why it was(!) popular. Your heart rate will be up throughout the entire movie. Which was new back then.But really , horror movie, what is the point.. why do we like to be scared?? To feel something. Bad excuse, we should strive for greater things.Real rating: 4.0 + props because it's old = 5.0</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did find this movie entertaining but it never created the depth of fear that's been ascribed to it. Lots of slow-moving, predictable segments and downright stodgy sequences. It had the feel of an unpolished television movie in many ways.The concept could have been pulled off with a lot more suspense and mystery, simply with better cinematic techniques.It seems like a movie people would enjoy best while drunk, clapping at certain scenes they remembered from previous watchings. One of those films that get an inexplicable reputation from word of mouth, but were never all that great.For a feeling of isolated terror near the poles, I think "The Last Winter" and especially "30 Days of Night" were much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS People have always told me how great "The Thing" is as a film. So it was with high anticipation that 15 years after it's release, I finally got round to watching it. It's a shame that I waited too long though. "The Thing" is a good film. It's tension builds nicely and the acting well above standard. Unfortunately it's also blatantly an 80s film, is ridiculously dated, and the special effects are practically Jim Henson standard.Not exactly a complicated story, the beauty of this film is it's occasional twists. Set in the arctic, it tells the story of a bunch of scientists (including a young Kurt Russell) who are conducting experiments. As events unfold however, it becomes apparent that they aren't quite alone.So taking the good points of "The Thing", it has great tension, the acting is up to standard, and occasionally it scares the bejezers out of you.It's just a shame that despite all that the special effects have faded over the years and the creature itself isn't really that scary anymore. Still, for what it is, "The Thing" is pretty damn cool!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of the 1951 Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby film, The Thing from Another World, sticking more closely to the John W. Campbell Jr. novel it was based, with an updated screenplay by Bill Lancaster (son of Burt), and directed by John Carpenter (Halloween, Starman), this is a special effects extravaganza. Basically an alien ship crashed to Earth, and then we see a helicopter circling an Antartican snowfield, trying to shoot a dog, and this is where American researchers work in their facility. They let the dog into their facility, but what they don't realise is that it is an alien copy, and it is only when they see the remains of a mangled body they discover and realise this "Thing" can transform and take the appearance of anyone amongst them. Everyone is now a suspect, because they don't know who is the "Thing", and one by one, the unlucky few are suffering the horrific terror attacks to it. The only way to determine the alien is taking blood and putting it in a dish, to see reaction to a hot needle, and they have to make sure all other remains of it are with it to be destroyed. Starring Kurt Russell as R.J. MacReady, Wilford Brimley as Dr. Blair, T.K. Carter as Nauls, David Clennon as Palmer, Keith David as Childs, Richard Dysart as Dr. Copper, Charles Hallahan as Vance Norris, Peter Maloney as George Bennings, Richard Masur as Clark, Donald Moffat as Garry, Joel Polis as Fuchs and Thomas G. Waites as Windows. It is almost unbelievable to think that absolutely every effect in this film was created by animatronics, no CGI whatsoever, and you have to remember that things and people are being ripped apart, and they still move! The story is good, the acting is as good as you can get, and the special effects, what can I say, a good horror classic. For some reason it was nominated the Razzie for Worst Musical Score for Ennio Morricone, I'll admit it isn't amazing, but it's not that bad. It was number 17 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carpenter actually managed to make his "The Thing" far inferior to its predecessor , the 1951 "The Thing From Another World". If you have read my comment on the latter you may know what I'm talking about, but the fact remains that you cannot make this sort of movie based purely on some cheesy monster, it has to be character driven first; that's why "Predator", the whole "Alien" franchise and some other monster movies work. And what does "The Thing" have to offer; well not much; Kurt Russel is his hillbilly self, taking the leader role from the very start and the rest of the cast doesn't amount to much either. The best part of the whole movie is the opener which really got me thinking and hoping what Carpenter had in store, but it just proved to be a disappointment. The movie also excluded some of the best scenes from the original, like showing the discovery of the space ship. The 1951 movie made that scene very thrilling, showing less than more, making the viewer yearn for a glimpse but never getting one. And don't get me started on the monsters; the comments I read from the IMDb users make you want to think the effects are better and scarier than anything you've ever seen, but the honest to God truth is I'd choose even the original creature from "Alien" any day. There are just so many things popping and bursting out of those creatures it's hard to swallow, and the head-turn-to-spider scene is a real gem when it comes to idiotic comedy. Plus it shows just how much the special effects creators were influenced by "Alien" which came out only a couple of years ago; the thing even lived off of the same thing, it needed a host and then it just ate whatever it could find. There were even similarities with the whole blood scene; alien's was acid, this one just lived forever and didn't like fire. I thought Morricone's score was quite good, the whole 5 minutes of it which I'm guessing is one of the reasons it got a Razzie nomination. Ha. Overall, a movie that doesn't pay much tribute to the original, nor does it manage to surpass it, not by a long shot. Not enough atmosphere, a poor script and a bad climax don't amount to much and probably the most inventive and positive thing in this whole mess is the very ending, which reminds us "The Thing" is definitely a Carpenter movie, sadly just not one of the better ones. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't really understand what all the rage is about. I found the story fairly slow moving and the "Dark Star"-esquire crew is in the way of creating a real threatening atmosphere. I find that odd as that has always been Carpenter's strong point, particularly in Assault or The Fog. Whereas the violence in the Fog is all inside the viewer's head, here it's right on the screen. I guess it's slightly unfair to judge with hindsight as the special effects are made less spectacular by the fact that we have seen them in Alien. What puzzled me most was Morricone's soundtrack which sounded is exactly like the music Carpenter himself composes. Why hire someone to copy you? All in all, I find Carpenter's first big studio film highly overrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Have Been A Lot Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was round about 15 when I heard about THE THING. A couple of trailers were shown on television promoting the cinema release . A few months later friends started discussing it in class ( They had seen it on pirate video . Obviously I will not condone this but it was very very common to watch pirate videos in the early 80s because that was the only way you`d get see the latest Hollywood blockbusters in those days ) So as soon as I could get my hands on a legal rental copy of THE THING I did so , mainly due to people saying things like " Watch THE THING Theo . The special effects are brilliant " and I was very very disappointed with it. Not only that but I became educated to the fact that good special effects usually = bad film .Over the years however THE THING has grown on me slightly . It`s a scary disturbing film but one that is ultimately destroyed by its characterisation and plot holes . For example why should we feel sorry for people who are totally unsympathetic in anyway ? I was under the impression that when writing a script you are to feel for the characters in it . I felt absolutely nothing for the men in the base in the Antartic , though maybe I`m doing Bill Lancaster a great disservice and the characters are written in such a cold way to match their surroundings . But the script suffers from several plot holes , the most obvious one being the fact that a research base in the South Pole comes equipped by endless supplies of explosives , guns and flamethrowers . What may I ask do you need all that for ? Is that in case you get attacked by a gang of vicious penguins ? And there`s a ( *****POSSIBLE SPOILER*****) credibility defying scene in which the base members - who have all been proven not to be infected by the alien - all split up for no other reason except to have an ambiguous ending where one of them might be infected by the alien after all . If they`d all stuck together the alien would have been unambiguously killed.THE THING does have its good points, though not very many. Best plus point is the special effects. If it`d been made 10 or 15 years later it would have been CGI dominated. I think CGI is a pretty poor and unconvincing effect and I`m sick and tired of seeing it constantly used in movies , the effects in this are much better than what we have been used to recently. This is an extremely dark bleak film , perhaps too dark and bleak which caused its disappointing box office sales, and lets not forget it was released at exactly the same time as ET. I`m a big DOCTOR WHO fan so I expect aliens to be nasty scumbags who have got a really nasty streak towards the human race , I don`t expect to see them befriend middle American children or fly around on bicycles , but that`s what aliens did in the 1980s , so I guess that THE THING was the last " they`re coming to get us " sci fi movie to come out of Hollywood for a while</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Is This In The IMDb Top 250?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This could easily have been a Star Trek episode and have been wrapped up in half the time. If only they had a universal translator or spoke Norwegian! The Thing may have been state of the art in 1982, but it just looks cheap in the 21st century where we are used to awesome CGI effects.I cannot believe that these men are "researchers" ? they seem more guys you would find in a police station, both the cops and the criminals. So, you can get high at the research station? And roller skate around it? Not very professional, indeed.Kurt Russell channels Escape from New York's Snake Plissken for John Carpenter who directed both films. How does Kurt's R.J. MacReady, who is the station's helicopter pilot, know everything and always have the right answer? MacReady wears the worst hat ever worn in the movies.Don't bother with this unbelievable farce.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ending of this piece of trash ruined the entire movie, which, in itself was not that good. If you want to see the REAL "Thing", go watch the classic film from the 1950's. Now that one was scary and with a decent ending. John Carpenter may be great but, in my opinion, he totally missed it with this one and wasn't even close to the '50s version. In the original version, everyone in the theater, both kids and adults were on the edge of their seats and everyone was talking about the movie after they left the theater. This version started out much the same as the original one but deviated, dramatically, as it progressed. I saw the original as a kid and it scared the heck out of me. I even had nightmares about it that night. The only thing I might say about the original is that it was in black and white and it MAY have been better had it been in color, which was not that common back at that time. This one should have had a totally different title because it really was nothing compared to the 50's version. I've never understood why screen writers, producers,directors, etc. think they are better than the original. Boo-Hiss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice idea, poorly realized, way overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Contains minor spoilers)I grabbed "The Thing" a few days ago, expecting a classic horror movie that I somehow managed to overlook before. Well, it turned out that I was wrong.Even though the plot of an isolated research station in Antarctica provide a very nice basis for a horror movie, Carpenter didn't make much of it. At times, it became just too obvious that he simply tried to mix some ingredients of other (real) classics of that time, namely Scott's "Alien" and Kubrick's "2001", and then expecting to get a great movie. Which did not work.On top of failing to provide any real new ideas (or even just special effects), the movie's storyline is very foreseeable. Plus, the characters do not act authentically - I don't buy that researchers shoot each other that easily or that they take the death of one of their colleagues that lightly ("well, he's been massacred by an alien monster, fine, let's burn and bury him and hope things will be fine").Conclusion: 4/10 - only for die-hard Carpenter fans. Better watch "Alien" one more time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't let the extremely high rating here on IMDb fool you, this movie does not deliver. It honestly did nothing but bore me the entire time. The movie starts off slow, and never really gets going. There's no character development with any of the characters sans Kurt Russell, and the movie relies on Gore &amp; special effects for it's scares. Trust me when I say there's absolutely nothing suspenseful about this movie, and the paranoia theme doesn't work here. What we basically get is some shape shifting Alien that apparently was frozen for thousands of years, which apparently a group of Norwegians was able to carry to their base, which then escaped and started attacking the group of Americans. That's the plot right there. What it does is it basically stays hidden as a dog for a very long time, apparently not in the mood to make it's attack, and only gets caught because apparently the sounds of dogs barking annoys it enough. And let's not forget how the seemingly immortal Shape Shifting Alien dies in such a laughably easy manner. Kurt Russell and his crew spend the entire time burning it down, and yet it somehow still finds a way to survive, making it seemingly immortal. Then at the end Russell blows it up easily with a stick of dynamite, which for some reason he never thought of doing before. We also have no idea what happens to the Nauls character, as he just disappears into oblivion. Apparently his character wasn't needed anymore, so the makers of this film decided to get rid of him by sending the character to go investigate something he saw, even though the character Nauls knows there's an Alien out there waiting to take over his body. Honestly, what sense does that make? That part right there was very poorly written. As to the ending, it really makes no sense because it features Russell's character and Childs sitting there wondering if each one is possibly The Thing, despite Russell just recently killing it. And if either one was The Thing, why didn't it attack the other? Why sit there drinking whiskey with a human when you could easily finish him off? It makes no sense to me. Also, neither apparently care to leave the freezing area, apparently leaving us to believe they both just die there. Anyway, the only points I give this movie for is the special effects, and the atmosphere. The location of Antarctica was fantastic, and the special effects for it's time were astounding. Other then that, this movie is poorly written and really boring. Pass on it, 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nonsensical monster, but movie is okay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Multimorphic monsters from space! Bah! Space monster movie authors, please, think about what you're writing. Where does that thing get the energy to morph like that? Where does it get the food to bulk up so quickly? How come it has so many ways of eating humans, and yet it never devours them completely, or maybe it doesn't need to because it insinuates itself into the body, but then why does it keep popping out like that? Why does it have both tentacles and arms in the end, and one misshapen head in the end, but then some kind of dog body coming out of it's middle? How would something like that have lived on its home planet?Anyway, the best scene in the movie is near the end, where three guys are tied up on a bench and one of them starts morphing, then the others start yelling and trying to get away. And the overall theme of paranoia and mistrust keeps it interesting enough to be viewed about once every 10 years. I give it 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A missed opportunity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The jaw-dropping special effects are practically the only worthy aspect of this surprisingly dull (and wildly overrated) horror movie. Lifeless and uninvolving, filled with uninteresting characters and potentially tense scenes (the attempt at trying to figure out who is infected by examining blood samples) that don't pay off. Don't ask me why, they just don't. Carpenter's followers sometimes seem willing to admire all his efforts, but this time he misses the mark. (*1/2)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Repugnant remake does boast macabre showmanship...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's nightmarish variation on the well-regarded 1951 chiller "The Thing From Another World" features a colorless cast of macho dullards led by Kurt Russell who tangle with unseen enemy at an Antarctic outpost. Overloaded with gross-out special effects, the movie seems destined to appeal mainly to connoisseurs of splatter-cinema (and, in that regard, it was somewhat ahead of its time). Carpenter, working from a weak screenplay, does all he can to raise shudders with the minimal material, but his atmospherics are disappointing, as are the performances. Still, the outlandishness of the violence stays with one--it's memorably disgusting. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overly dark remake of classic 1951 sci-fi thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We know that John Carpenter revers the original "Thing," directed by Howard Hawks back in 1951. For one thing, he's said so but it's also playing on the TV the kids are watching in Carpenter's original "Halloween." Too bad Carpenter was unduly influenced by Ridley Scott's "Alien" because this film's tone comes off a shade heavier than the atmosphere on Jupiter.A good cast is generally wasted in a treatment spoiled by Carpenter's penchant for excessive violence. Maybe we've got a creature with mind-numbing power and a real threat to the human race but there's no dramatic build-up, no interplay between characters, absolutely no humor--in other words, a good time is had by none.Would have liked to have seen a story unfold like the original instead of the steady series of blows to the gut that Carpenter delivers. He had all the pieces here--U.S. Antarctic post finds Norwegian camp destroyed near their discovery of a spaceship in the ice. Thing terrorizes US camp. But, whoa, we go into horror overdrive and everything goes downhill. Should do it again and get it right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely Overrated!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>--If you have seen this movie please read on, if not Do NOT read, this contains many spoilers--The story idea is an interesting one, I do agree with that but, some of the dialog, and scenes are a bit far fetched. They fly to the others base, it's all burnt up a destroyed, they walk in unaware, of everything(no dialog),and then start asking where everyone is. The inside has so many holes in the walls its basically an ice cube tray, and the place looks like WW3 on the inside and out! They walk in calmly and "don't notice?!" the burnt corpse they walk right by. What an unrealistic scene. Then when they are reviewing the footage they retrieve from that lab, they are looking at a big shot of the middle of the arctic, with some snow cleared a large area of ice.. One character says, "looks like there is something buried under the ice"...Wow he has superman vision! The space ship, is buried about 100+ feet under the arctic ice(can any human see 100+ feet into ice, ever been ice fishing? well it's impossible.)and he some how manages to see it, it's ridiculous. Now for you people that actually raked this movie a 10! This is a question for you! They decide, to test the doctor's blood that is locked in the shed. They approach the door and: #1) The door is unlocked and no valid reason was ever given how the doctor opened the door, since it was pad locked from the outside. #2) they find that within 2 days he dug a huge tunnel under his shed, complete with a large area, and on the inside a 3/4 complete space ship... I mean seriously. How can a person/alien move that much snow in 2 days(watch The great escape(1962) this will explain how long it takes to move dirt), then escape your padlocked shed and have time to steal helicopter parts and build a 3/4 complete space ship? Not like those aliens moved extremely fast, it was completely unfeasible. Then the lights go out, (and I HATED this part) they realize the generator was down. Kurt russel says, "We are not going to make it out of here alive" ...um why? Can't fix the generator? Can't fly the helicopter(you are a pilot, if you forgot)? Cant get in one of the many snow machines and warm yourselfs up? ....BAD line! Just give up hope the second the generators down? No, you try to live,if anyway possible...so stupid. Last but not least this was made in 1982 so i realize, the special effects were kinda weak, but there are so many other problems with this film, it's amazing that people would rank this so high. There are A lot of other issues within this film as well, too many for me to list really. This movie is HIGHLY overrated (currently) ranked higher than Terminator, I mean come on, if your going to rate this make it your own opinion and don't follow what others think. Really, is this movie that good? Nope!5 - 10 Stars, and I am being extremely lenient.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blah.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An ultimately bland, dull, and pointless exercise. As slow moving as 'The Big Chill,' John Carpenter's version of Campbell's classic 'Who Goes There?' is more faithful to the monster but ultimately as thrilling as a term paper.While the Howard Hawks film re-wrote the monster into a simple marauding, though intelligent being, at least that film built a sense of menace and a hurtling momentum to its story. Carpenter's version is slow, talky, dull, and punctuated only by over-the-top silliness that shows his puerile obsession with gore-puppets. The 'paranoia' of people who may not be who they seem plays much better in 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' or 'Planet of the Vampires,' or even in Campbell's own story. This version is simply so slow, the characters so stilted, the story so jumpy and plodding that the final act of the film is a relief, not an experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bloody mess and too gross-out for its own good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>so i just rented this movie, I'm only 22 but being on the internet hearing so much about this horror movie "the thing", i knew that despite me hating bloody/gory movies, i was eventually gonna have to see it. well this is my take: sure it was creepy and pretty disturbing effects and the tension and paranoid feeling is OK (although done better in older scifi films like "body snatchers") but lets face it, this movie was and is a cult movie. no way this was ever going to be a mainstream film. and today, movies like this that are old and gross seem to be very popular in todays goth/punk culture of death, anyone notice? no wonder its got such a (highly undeserved) rating on IMDb! older movies from the 70's/80's that are known to be gross and twisted with those supremely gross special effects are actually more popular now then they were back then. i think its just a stupid trend and shows was perverted times were are living in. movies like the thing, army of darkness, Texas chainsaw massacre, Halloween etc (just look at all the new remakes!) are all more popular now then they were back in the day. and no greater example of this then the Thing. i think its just a really lame trend that needs to go away and fast! this movie was a onetime view and nothing more. certainly not something you can watch 20+ times unless your like a sick freak or something. seeing ppls heads getting torn apart and see poor innocent dogs getting brutally attacked by some idiot monster (guess there isn't intelligent life out there huh?) just isn't my idea of a good time at the movies. movies IMO are meant to make you feel good or if anything, have the good guy win in the end. but movies like this are dumb and depressing. i don't need real life fear in movies, unless i know the good guy is gonna kill the evil thing. i just think movies like this are too gross for there own good. i mean, you didn't see movies like this in the 1950's or even the 60's that much. pretty scary when you think that you can get away making disturbing movies like this, and they are even worse today! thanks to movies like the Thing and even Alien, we now have these insanely graphic gross-out movies by the ton. well, you can be sure i will never give them the time of day. I'm not a fan of ultra scifi cuz most of scifi tends to be creepy, gross and depressing with always a question to things. i don't like that, reminds me too much of real life. but there are some "alien" movies i really do enjoy, like Independence Day, Star Wars movies, Predator (which although it has SOME blood, its certainly not over the top gross like some of these others). but overall, not a big scifi fan, and the thing is just too gross for anyone IMO. only the most depraved of people would actually enjoy this kind of movie, along with the evil dead and other films of that ilk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly revolting film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've only seen one other film that affected me as badly, and as permanently - Pasolini's "Salo". There, the film was revolting for a reason. Here, it is just revolting, badly written, and badly acted. Nothing but pure shock and gore and the most repulsive special effects I've ever seen. No story, stupid characters, and patently ridiculous. There are ways to be frightened, but this is about as entertaining as mutilating yourself.I swore when I saw it back at its release that if John Carpenter had been in the lobby of the theater, I would have punched him for making me feel so thoroughly disgusted. That still holds true. Whatever else good he may have done, I have never been able to have any respect for Carpenter after seeing this. He has talent beyond doubt, but this film also shows that he has a heart of pure shlock.I truly hate this movie, and I wish I had never seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I made a huge mistake when renting 'The Thing'. Yes, it is a classic, but it just didn't fit my taste. First of all, I thought it would tell about a spirit, a ghost or something like that, but no, it was about a space creature! And god I hate space creature movies (except E.T.)! Especially this one. It was boring, though the idea was good and special effects too. But still, I didn't like it. Maybe it was the actors, maybe the directing... The dialogs were dull and stupid and the characters too. Only good thing about this film were the lovely Husky-dogs (which of course died during the movie...). So in one sentence: The Thing is a movie, that no-one who doesn't want to die because of boredness, shouldn't rent.</fullReview>
