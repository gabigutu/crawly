		<fullReview>Well there is the case of the Remake, but I will criticize that, on it's own. Let's just say, that the remake never even comes close to the south Korean horror/thriller, that we've been served here. A movie, with a great visual style, a very good art direction and camera man. It's edited in a manner, that allows you to dig deep into the suspense story (if you let yourself do that, that is) and still remains complex enough to challenge your brain (something you can't say about the remake though).The acting is pretty strong, for a movie that is declared a horror movie (although as I mentioned it walks a thin line between that and the mystery/suspense thriller element it also has ... almost like a detective story, with a touch of drama in it). Of course if you know that you can't handle Asian movies well, than you won't be able to like it as much as I (and others) did</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent thriller with good traditional photographic effect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was only my fourth experience with a Korean film, and was probably the best I've seen so far.By my so-far limited experience, Korean films share many production values with Canadian ones. Well-balanced real location lighting, good use of real ambient soundtracks, acting that is at times understated even to the point of awkwardness, and skilled use of traditional in camera photographic effects are among these.As the title implies (English: Into the Mirror), there are a number of cleverly executed mirror shots throughout the film. For viewers who are fans of good photographic effects, this is a must-see for this reason alone.This is a more "traditional" thriller, with decent suspense tying the story together. The film does not rely on fancy effects to fill in what would otherwise be plot; there's an actual story here, and though it may be somewhat disjointed at times, it follows throughout the film and leads to an ending that may not be entirely surprising, but is satisfying nonetheless.I viewed the film with its original 5.1 soundtrack (very nicely mixed) and have to say that the English subtitling (at the least) is easy to follow.A good watch for those who like suspense rather than mere graphic violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the accidental death of his partner Young-ho in a hostage situation, the former detective of the Seoul Special Operations Force Woo Young-min (Ji-tae Yu) feels responsible for the tragedy and quit the police force joining the private security company SecuZone. His uncle and owner of the department store Dreampia, Jeon-il Sung (Ju-bong Gi), hires Woo to be the chief of the security of Dreampia, which was rebuilt after a fire where many employees died and is near the reopening in spite of the protest of the families of the victims that claim their indemnity. When an employee dies after hours in the store, Woo leads an internal investigation, while detective Ha Hyun-Su (Myeong-mim Kim) that blames Woo for the death of his friend Young-ho, and his assistant Park, come to the store to lead an official investigation. When other employees that worked in the same department are mysteriously killed in the store, Woo meets Lee Ji-hyun (Hye-na Kim), the twin sister of Lee Jeong-hyun, that convinces him that her sister has not died in the fire and is trapped in the mirrors, while Ha Hyun-Su believes that Lee Ji-hyun is the serial killer."Geoul Sokeuro" is another great South Korean horror movie. With a complex screenplay that discloses an intricate and intriguing supernatural plot, this film is supported by great direction and acting and excellent camera work, using mirrors in many unexpected scenes. The horror is not gore but psychological, and there is an important and complex explanation about the "mirror-world" that is basic to understand the end of the story. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Espelho" ("Mirror")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good. Better than the American remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this because I saw the American remake earlier in the day (Mirrors). Its nice to see that the remake isn't an exact mashing of the original film. Here an ex-cop goes to work for his uncle's department as a security guard. The store is reopening after a fire and everything is going fine until a series of deaths start up. The tone of the two films is different with the American version dark and brooding and this one more bright and open. The fact that the store is opening allows for things like security cameras that further add to the story. I don't know if I liked this version or didn't like this version since my feelings are so tied up with what I saw earlier in the day. It is certainly good, but its different enough that my getting lost on comparing the two films distracts from this one. I'll have to watch it again to know what I really feel.(I will say this I think the original is more internally consistent)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One excellent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was based on a psychological analysis for mirror and patients who suffered severe shocks. The movie doesn't really have a ghost or a bloody scene, however, the flimmaker intentionally puts mirror into the film many times, the fear and thrill flows underneath the screen.The film starts with a department store in South Korea, the department store caught fire and one woman was killed. Few years later the department store was opened again and those people who hold secrets of the department store and the dead woman began to be killed.To tell the truth, the film was great and I recommend you all to see this!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A curate's egg of a movie, but engaging nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite being unsure what it is, Into the Mirror succeeds in spinning an entertaining yarn.Ji-tae Yu is Woo Yeong-min, a former policeman who's been reduced to security guard for his uncle's company since a hostage incident 1 year prior resulted in the death of a man as a consequence of a mistake from Min. He opted to shoot the aggressor and missed, shooting his reflection by mistake. The occurrence left him completely traumatised and entirely miserable, and unable to look himself in the mirror.However, when 2 employees of the company die in extremely mysterious circumstances, Min's former partner on the force, Heo Hyeon-su joins the investigation and strange goings on continue.Part supernatural chiller, part cop drama, part psychological drama, part surreal mystery, Into the Mirror is very much an eclectic mix of different styles of movie. It without question succeeds in the basic discipline of any film, that of concertedly engaging the viewer's attention for the duration, and it does this thanks to a number of elements:First of all the cinematography is spot on, and is extremely good at facilitating the supernatural psychology. Aided by a director who seems to know exactly what to show us, each scene is smartly captured, with many clever uses of mirrors. Many occasions will call for your attention on more than one thing, and the mystery of wondering what, if any, wrongness will occur is well realised. Furthermore, the acting is surprisingly decent for an Asian movie. As ignorant as that may sound, I have viewed many Asian films and the acting is uniformly rather bland. Even though westerners do not understand the language, emotion et al can still come across on celluloid and Asian movies are often left wanting here. However, Into the Mirror is more than decent in this area for once, with good performances from a fair few players. It certainly adds to the experience when it's not just the story we watch for.There lies another strength. As touched on earlier the movie is downright entertaining, and relies on a pretty strong script and effective narrative. This film is never boring, aided and abetted by a script which never has vacuous moments and empty sequences. Everything is there for a reason.However, the big weakness is the overriding suspicion that the film really doesn't know what it is trying to be. With so many styles mixed together, it comes across as more of a salad bowl than melting pot. Weird goings-on akin to the spooky occurrences in movies like Ring seem a little out of joint in the company of a police drama and crime mystery.However, if you are willing to forgive this lack of harmony, like I, then you can overlook it and accept the movie for what it is: An entertaining yarn with enough going for it to keep you watching.One last flaw though is the ending. Obviously I am not going to give it away, but the problem with it is it seems far too ambitious, and not a tad confusing. I was left not so much baffled as to what was going on, but what it actually meant overall. This took the shine off perhaps a little, but it was still a fine picture overall and I would still recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not an exceptional movie, but it's worth watching...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not totally agreed to categorize Into the Mirror as a pure horror movie. In my opinion, it is more of a thriller movie, with horror elements within it. It does have a 'ghostly' appearance and 'supernatural' effect like 'those 'deviating' images in the mirror. It is slow-paced movie, with investigations involving cops with hundreds of dialogue lines, more of a drama. And the eerie tension is noticeably below average, only at some points where homicide occurred, and it was not much, I notice there were only four deaths in this movie, including death of the antagonist near the final scene. That's why I prefer to call this movie as a thriller, not a pure horror movie.The idea for the movie was original, it was quite good. Instead of focusing storyline on haunted house, hotel, etc, the director decided to take different approach into making a horror movie (though I think he did not make a quite impression of a horror one). Into the Mirror tells the story of a series of mysterious deaths occurred in a supermarket, all which involving mirrors. Finally it was revealed that all victims were murdered by their own mirror images. And there was a clumsy cop trying to investigate the murders as he was still traumatized for carelessly causing the death of his own partner while held as hostage by a group of crooks. The investigation became more complicated as it unwrapped some peculiar facts like the concept of 'another world behind the mirrors' (well this one is more of a fantasy, world behind mirrors, eh?), 'a ghost seek for revenge', and 'twin sisters'. The plot was then rather predictable: the task of the cop was to help the 'undead' looking for the murderer.The opening scene itself was excellent. Scene of an employer trapped inside the supermarket after it was closed looking for exit, and then she was killed when standing in front of a mirror. A decent introduction to the movie's storyline.However, despite the somewhat good ending (i.e. the aforementioned revenge was successful), the ending was rather vague. Unlike the self-explanatory opening scene, it is quite possible that the ending left you many unsolved and confusing questions. It was told that the protagonist had actually died in the real world, and now he lived in the mirror world. Little bit confusing, right? Ah yes, maybe the director did not want to leave a 'pure' good ending, instead leaving you with questions, or else, forced you to watch the movie over and over again to understand the ending.Generally, while not the best movie ever made, Into The Mirror is still worth a try (or rent, if you are reluctant to buy). As a horror movie, it still lacked requirements to be a good one. But the unique story has its own strong point. Maybe it's so strong that it interested Hollywood to remake their own version of this movie (of course with more terrors and gory scenes, Hollywood-style (Mirrors starring Kiefer Sutherland anyone?). Yeah, another Asian flick to be remade by Hollywood!). If you like horror movies with non-stop terror, do not watch this. You will be boring by its slow-paced story and hellishly long dialogue lines. But if you are willing to be more patient, maybe you will find hidden gem somewhere between the scenes (in which, too bad, I mostly didn't). Not a special movie that I will remember for a long time though, but it is not that bad. Give the mirrors a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting addition to the Korean horror genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>INTO THE MIRROR is an intriguing mix of police procedural and supernatural horror, an unwieldy but effective combination that proved successful enough for Hollywood to attempt a remake (the Kiefer Sutherland-starrer MIRRORS, which upped the gore but lost something in translation in the process). The film's setting is a once-deserted shopping mall, always a choice location for the movies and one that doesn't disappoint here; in places it drips with an eerie, provocative atmosphere.What I liked most about this movie was the mixing of genres. On one hand there's a serial killer aspect to the murders, which are inventive without being gruesome. Then there's the supernatural touch, which is handled subtly and effectively, particularly in that great twist ending. Finally, there's the police procedural side which dominates most of the running time, and that's interesting too because the cops are humanised.Ji-tae Yu's former detective Woo, now working as chief of security at the mall, is by far the most interesting of the characters. Although he's saddled with one of those all-too-familiar back stories involving him making a fatal error, the script works well to make him sympathetic and an intriguingly balanced lead. Myung-min Kim's officious detective is well placed as Woo's antagonist and the story that develops is never less than enthralling. A good little movie, this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I always thought there was something unnerving about mirrors.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An ex-cop becomes as a security guard to escape the haunting past where a mistake cost him his partner's life. Now he's working in a shopping complex owned by his uncle, but he gets caught up in a series of bizarre deaths that are occurring in the building. All of these deaths seem to be link somehow to mirrors, which cover most of the building. So now he becomes involved in the police investigation surrounding these unusual circumstances. Another little unknown Asian flick, this time from South Korea, which really snuck up on me. But on that point it had me in two minds. Neither was it bad nor good. At times, I couldn't care less what was happening, but at least it didn't follow the same suit of most Asian films of last couple of years? well kinda. 'Into the Mirror' is a murder mystery that dabbles into the supernatural by involving the folklore about a world that lives through the mirror, where a part of our soul can cross over. To quote the narration from the flick "Self-hatred triggered by a mental shock, can cause a personality to split and perceive two worlds inside and outside the mirror. The world is divided into two symmetrical worlds, both perceived by the person who is psychologically split. If you die outside the mirror you can still be living inside. And if you die inside the mirror you see no reflection". Now that would've made for an involving watch, but sadly this idea isn't taken advantage of. Instead it's just too bad that they seemed to settle on the tired and we've seen it all before sub-plot about the cop trying to come to terms with his past and then getting involved in a investigation that doesn't really add up. This actual sub-plot does have merit to how it connects with this mirror theory, but it's not as interesting as delving into this belief of two worlds. The parts involving this premise are the most lively and neat moments within the film. The opening half an hour has such a brood mood and nice supernatural touch, with characters dying strange deaths and the last 15 minutes has a decent climax that probably goes on for too long, but it ends in a cool fashion. Then there's the ending which makes you think well there goes by a good story right there, why did it take that long (?). The mid-section is where it gets really bogged down though, the drama element sees most of the daylight and by shaping the way for the lengthy investigation and feuding cops moments? and the creepy opening to it all has sort of lost its way through this stage. During the middle half it's not so hard to tell what's going to happen next and so the puzzle isn't really one at all, because you already guessed the key players. But you have to wait until the last 15 min for some new unexpected twists. There's a moral stacked into the story about conquering your fear, or it will eventually destroy if you don't face it and not to trust what you always see. The film looks a treat, being rather stylish in detail and in its glossed up set pieces. They make good use of the film's environment (that being mostly set in a shopping complex) with beautifully presented ideas and visuals make you sit up. Helping that is a bone rattling score and the camera-work has its moments by putting you off balance with its fluid angles and shots. The performances are incredibly down played and mostly giving lifeless expressions, but that works out within this film's dour context, but the main lead was probably a bit too wooden. 'Into the Mirror' is a fair and ambitious horror-mystery flick, even if it's a muddle of ideas executed in a patchy manner. You just can't stop thinking what could have been if they concentrated more on the supernatural side of things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Korean horror similar to phone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Into the mirror is indeed, yet another great Asian horror film that's plot revolves around ghosts, possessed spirits and pretty gruesome killings. The trademark plot twist isn't there, though there is a surprise ending(i wouldn't call it a twist) The film is about mirrors. In Korea it is believed that there are 2 worlds, the normal world and the mirror world. They believe that if you die in the real world you remain in the mirror world, and if you die in the mirror world you have no reflection. Into the mirror is original and at some points very eerie. The film is quite gruesome and has some cringe-worthy moments. The end is a bit muddled but still a must-see for Asian horror fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cool and classy Korean horror thriller, but results are pretty patchy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Into The Mirror is for all its gloss and good reviews not an especially great film. If all of it were as good as its opening it would a be a real triumph of a film, and if it were all as good as its first half hour or so it would merely be very good. Sadly after hitting the ground running and continuing for a while at a storming pace things quieten down to such a degree that the film sheds interest to just about the point of becoming a bit of a drag. The story follows a security chief at a department store about to re-open, having previously suffered a fire. But strange deaths are occurring, something definitely isn't right and there are secrets from the past waiting to be uncovered. Yes, its a lot like many other ghostly Asian horror films, but at least for a little while it is pretty danged ace. The few deaths of the first half hour are all creepily inspired, grisly, imaginative and fairly spooky, driven by a really nice idea. But the film takes on drama and police investigation elements as well as its mystery and horror to the point where anything scary is drowned out by the film shooting for pathos and slowly unwrapping its mystery, a mystery that actually doesn't dovetail that well with how the film starts out. It all turns conventional plotwise and rolls along with only fair interest until its nifty finale in which it recovers its balls and achieves a decent degree of gnarly tension and a couple of sweet bloody moments. What really stops the film from edging into the mediocre is the beautifully stylish direction of Sung-ho Kim, Into The Mirror is a tremendously visual film with great use of mirrors, windows, screens and portal like spaces throughout, there is an intriguing feel throughout that the environment is full of spaces where the unknown might intrude into our world. This interest combined with the typically fine acting, Ji Tae Hu full of downtrodden but determined pathos as the hero, Hye-na Kim mysterious as a lady who may be key to the whole mystery and Myeong min Kim effective as a colleague with a bit of a grudge among others, give the film a reasonable enough hook throughout to keep things from ever becoming dull. So all in all for me this wasn't a great film, but a pretty solidly decent one. Partially recommended then, certainly not bad but not a stunner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some good ideas and a chilling end - Spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was expecting something along the lines of The Ring or Dark Water with this one. The general mood, however, it much lighter and less claustrophobic, and the story focuses more on the plight of the ex-cop and the traumatic experience that cost him his job than on the haunted supermarket in which the film opens.Certain story points are left dangling (eg. why was Yeong-min released? They still had his prints on the gun, which, as far as evidence went, was harder than anything else in this film).In my opinion, the potential in the effects was never fully realised. There are no real shocks. Maybe this is because Kim Seong-ho himself expected to make a Ring kind of film, so instead of going straight for the jugular, he went more for the lurching things-that-go-bump-in-the-night approach. I for one would have liked it if they had used more won on the effects and made them really jump at me (and make me jump).Still, the final scene and the chilling realisation of what has happened to Yeong-min is worth it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beware the mirrors! They are evil!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I was a bit evil myself to put a comment titled like that, and the film was a good one. The problem with it is that is not really scary. It's a nice thriller and , as some other viewers have noticed, has a nice pace in the first half, but then gets sluggish. The lead actor doesn't show a lot of emotion in his acting and that also sets the feeling of the movie to a lower level. The ending is really unrealistic to the extreme (for a ghost movie, that is :) )But the idea is nice. Another world may lie beyond a mirror and things that happened there might not mimic exactly what s happening here. Parts of people might get trapped in mirrors or exact revenge coming from there. Anything else, though, is pretty confusing. I am not Asian so a lot of the names in the movie sounded alike. Add to this that the dead girl had a twin sister and there were mirrors everywhere and you can understand why I felt confused.As Asian horror movies go, I would rather see a cliché "bad hair wet ghost with spooky eyes" than this kind of thriller, but this film definitely has some good and original parts in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A self-reflective murder mystery.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This could have been a good story if it had not been a supernatural fantasy. By combining the elements of murder mystery with fantasy, however, means that the viewer has a bigger job in suspending disbelief...So, why did I keep watching? One reason only: the very clever use of mirrors that form a constant motif ? in fact, a psychological sine qua non ? throughput the entire film. To that extent, this is a stunner. The camera techniques will have you trying to work out how a particular shot was achieved. So, from a technical aspect, the production crew deserves high marks, no question.The story, however, is difficult to follow and not only because sub-titles are generally atrocious to follow; it's just a very convoluted narrative that twists and turns along many paths. Fortunately for me, that was alleviated to some extent by the clever visuals.And, now that I think of it, there's another reason for watching this film: the ending. All through the story, mirrors are the focus ? for many important reasons, as you will see ? and at the end, there's a twist that hints at much wider implications about the real world and the nature of reality. A bit arty, perhaps, as an ending, but one that does reflect the problem of personal identity. When you watch, you'll see what I mean...Not recommended for kiddies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Parts of this horror movie are absolutely brilliant. The opening scene, with the doomed girl standing in front of a mirror, is a real stunner! And for the first half hour things move along quite effectively. We get some amazing visuals, mostly concerning mirrors, and good suspense too. Then, after that half hour mark, we get some truly boring dialog scenes and a lot of quarreling between our hero (who, according to me, seems to be a nice guy but a complete bore!) and an ex-colleague of his (he used to be a police but resigned after a shooting accident). Things pick up later in the movie, but the ending is a little bit of a let-down, because the build-up had so far been (mostly) very effective. But it is a nice idea for a horror story and well directed! Give it a try and I think you'll like it! :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overly ambitious Korean ghost story but with some creepy highlights</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main plot of Into the Mirror concerns some spooky deaths (concerning mirrors) that delay the re-opening of a large department store. The supernatural elements, of ghost-characters that seem to exist the other side of the mirror (and can sometimes reach through to the real world) are played well, but the plot holes in the real and surreal story lines become wearying and detract from the ingenious psychological twists. It has a deft storyline, and all the promise of a modern supernatural-psychological horror, but the hallmarks of inadequately developed Asian cinema and frailty in details. Will probably get re-made at some point with a Western-friendly makeover - and without the subtitles many viewers would probably be more forgiving of such better-than-mediocre but hardly outstanding horror stories.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Into the Mirror" has an interesting and unique premise, a good story, and a few decently creepy scenes. And even though it sounds promising, you can't help but feel as if there's something missing. The first ten minutes has all the atmosphere, all the suspense, and the shock factor to make the rest of the film great. But the atmosphere, the sense of dread and suspense strangely disappears after then, and never really comes back. From then on, it sets up the mystery, and until the last twenty-five minutes, things are dull and uninvolving.Despite the apparent terror factor that's missing, I do have to say that the film itself is well-made and has high-quality production values. The photography and imagery is nice, the Ho-sung Kim's direction is stylish and artsy, the acting is really good (with a very welcomed performance by Ji-tae Yu, as seen in "Gawi" and "Oldboy"), and the visual effects are impressive.So, I know a lot of people love this movie, but I personally think this is, well.. a wasted opportunity. There's some interesting things here, but "Into the Mirror" left me disappointed.My rating: 5.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the dullest experiences I've had watching Foreign Horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the accidental death of his partner Young-ho in a hostage situation, the former detective of the Seoul Special Operations Force Woo Young-min feels responsible for the tragedy and quit the police force joining the private security company SecuZone. His uncle and owner of the department store Dreampia, Jeon-il Sung, hires Woo to be the chief of the security of Dreampia, which was rebuilt after a fire where many employees died and is near the reopening in spite of the protest of the families of the victims that claim their indemnity. When an employee dies after hours in the store, Woo leads an internal investigation, while detective Ha Hyun-Su that blames Woo for the death of his friend Young-ho, and his assistant Park, come to the store to lead an official investigation. When other employees that worked in the same department are mysteriously killed in the store, Woo meets Lee Ji-hyun...I know I'm probably going to get heat for this, but I felt the remake was miles better than this one. I appreciate the fact that it went the thinking route, instead of gore, but did it have to be so damn boring? I didn't care about any of the characters, I was continuously looking at my watch, I wasn't thrilled, and I certainly wasn't scared. Say what you want about the remake, at least it's suspenseful, and this has none of that, despite what a lot of people may tell you, it didn't do anything for me in my opinion. I was unfortunate to come across this, as a special feature of the DTV sequel Mirrors 2(Which is just as bad)Bottom line. No suspense, no scares, your better off watching paint dry. I seriously couldn't stand this movie, and consider it highly overrated. Be my guest if you wanna see it, lots of people like it, I'm not in the minority. And it provides a rarity when a remake does it better.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>6.2 votes equal to fragile. And 'now clear that this site has a strong antipathy towards the horror film. If this movie had been in Stephen King would have had more. For me to go to pieces is the comment by Aaron1375. AARON STILL TU, quache distant relative of SHARON? Restless character already seen previously. Why make comparisons between SILENT HILL AND MIRRORS? E '100 times better this movie. Silent hill comes from a video. Do you have anything like the original film plot. There are mediocre film recited by actors who have high ratings as we are beautiful film recited by people less known. This site is so. In this movie there is a coup scene that leaves us with mouth open the others kind of Nicole Kidman. But since this movie and played by Sutherland takes one vote less. that's disgusting. Arise THE VOTE!</fullReview>
