		<shortDescription>Truly Terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For one the first movie wasn't very good (so your expectations are low anyway). BUT this movie is WAY worse. The dialogue is terrible and at times the acting is almost laughable. Nick Stahl has been in some decent movies, but in this he looks like he's just come out of rehab and took this part for a quick buck. He clearly didn't read the script or watch the first movie, which makes me think he didn't care as long as he got the work.If your watching it for the shocks, you won't find any in this which actually "work" (not unless your of an extremely sensitive disposition at least). A character doing "insane things" in a mirror while a "normal" person at the other side of it "isn't" can only work SO MANY TIMES (like once) before your completely bored and used to the whole thing.No story. No plot. No believable characters. No dialogue. No scares. No decent effects. No decent nudity (at least get REAL looking women, not plastic surgeon modelling wanna be actress rejects). Not worth renting.At the end of this movie one of the characters screams. I knew EXACTLY how he felt. I imagined he'd just watched the movie himself and was sharing my pain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mirrors 2" isn't exactly in the same league as its predecessor. Unlike the Kiefer Sutherland story, there's more or less no suspense. Not because its predictable (which it isn't), but simply because it's a sequel. Actually, this isn't a sequel. It's a rehash of the first one, except there's no mystery this time. I found this "sequel" fairly enjoyable, and I recommend to anyone not expecting too much out of it. Compared to the previous story, this one is a pale imitation, which is easy to see why it went straight to DVD. A worthy rental, but it's not worth spending 20 some dollars on.**1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sequels normally aren't as good as the original film, but often times they are good films in their own right. They can be inferior for a variety of reasons; made without heart, straying too far from the story, or perhaps worst of all staying too close to it. When a sequel is more like a loose remake of the first film it makes one wonder what the point of making it was. The first 'Mirrors' in my book is one of the better Horror films of the last several years and quite underrated, but if a sequel was never made it wouldn't be the end of the world. But it was announced Fox was prepping one for home video, which is usually not a good sign. Once in a while the film turns out to be worthy, but unfortunately in this case it's just another forgettable straight to video effort.Pros: Some decent performances, some by actors who deserve better material. Good score. Fast paced all the way. Some memorable and brutal deaths. Also the effects, gore and visual, are pretty good. Not a bad twist.Cons: Plot is just a reworking of the original's. Completely lacking in suspense. Not one bit scary. Most of the characters are poorly developed. Also some of the performances leave something to be desired. Twist is poorly executed. Ending is anticlimactic. Very drab looking.Final thoughts: After watching this it's easy to see why it wasn't given a theatrical release. There's some good in this film, but it's mired in mediocrity thanks largely to a lukewarm script and a few off performances. It's like they weren't even trying this time and what we're left with is basically a mediocre sequel-cum-remake of a much better and more effective Horror flick. Skip it.My rating: 2/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mirrors 2" is pretty okay as a stand-alone feature, but it pales in comparison with Alexandre Aja's first film (which on its term was a re-make of an Asain film). This time, the film isn't exactly what the first one was about. Instead they turned it into a 'vengeful ghost' story. Not bad, really, but pretty standard stuff. Nevertheless, we get a couple of bloody death scenes, a bit of nice atmosphere, a dash of mystery (which isn't too hard to figure out) and some okay performances (though no Oscar worthy material, naturally). The over-all end result is just about decent enough. You could do a lot worse with other stuff that's being cranked out on DVD nowadays, especially when it comes to (loose) sequels. Teaming up "Mirrors 2" as a double bill with something like "White Noise 2: The Light" wouldn't be a bad way to spend a straight-to-DVD horror sequel night with your girlfriend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better then expected.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really dug this film. It is a film that is not for the squeamish Im telling you. The movie stars Nick Stahl who will probably best be remembered as the second John Conner in Terminator 3, or the "Yellow Bastard" Roark Jr. from Sin City. This is a intense little horror thriller. That feeds on suspense and the viewers ...empathy. With its situational awkwardness and bloody gory scenes. It is under the radar because its a straight to video release. I actually think it is a far superior movie then the first film. A better story and less money behind it. I truly believe this film is a hidden gem. Less can be more. Sometimes independent films are better then... mainstream releases because every dollar counts and that they need to be used wisely. What is more important to a mature audience story or mainstream actors and special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While driving on the road with his fiancée Kayla (Jennifer Sipes), Max Matheson (Nick Stahl) has a serious car accident and they both die. However, Max is resuscitated and one year later he is an emotionally disturbed man with the guilty complex for the murder of his beloved fiancée and under psychological treatment with Dr. Beaumont (Ann Mckenzie). When his father Jack Matheson (William Katt) reopens the Mayflower Department Store in New Orleans, his security guard Henry Schow (Evan Jones) has an accident and Jack invites Max to be his replacement to help in his cure. Max accepts the job and his father introduces him to the store manager Keller Landreaux (Lawrence Turner); the buyer Jenna McCarty (Christy Romano); and the vice-president of operations Ryan Parker (Jon Michael Davis). Max has visions of a dead woman and he foresees the death of Jenna and Ryan in the mirror. Sooner Max finds that he has the ability to see Eleanor Reigns (Stephanie Honoré Sanchez), an employee that is missing, and he contacts her sister Elizabeth Reigns (Emmanuelle Vaugiér) to know details of her disappearance. He finds that Jenna, Ryan and Keller were responsible for a tragedy and now the spirit of Eleanor is seeking revenge. "Mirrors 2" is an underrated horror movie, with a flawed but good story and reasonable acting. The greatest flaw in the plot is the lack of explanation why Eleanor attacks Jack Matheson that is absolutely innocent. The gorgeous and sexy Emmanuelle Vaugiér has difficulties to perform a dramatic role and keeps her ironical face most of the time. But the special effects are excellent and considering that this is a straight-to-video film, the result is above average. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Espelhos do Medo 2" ("Mirrors of the Fear 2")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movies may be more boring than they appear in the mirror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, having just sat through this sequel to the otherwise fairly nice movie "Mirrors" from 2008, this movie was somewhat of a disappointing follow-up.First of all, I wonder if any of the people behind this movie ever saw "Stir of Echoes" (the movie with Kevin Bacon)? Because "Mirrors 2" seems like an outright copy of that movie, just set in a different setting.This movie isn't all bad, don't get me wrong. I think the acting was actually fair enough, although it is no award-winning performances, but people did well enough with what they had. However, the movie is lacking depths for the characters, because you never get to immerse yourself fully into the characters.And also the effects were good enough. And the apparition of Eleanor in the mirror was just disturbing enough to make her (at least) somewhat creepy to look at.The storyline and plot is not well-thought through. As I mentioned above, it seems to be a replica of "Stir of Echoes". Despite that, then the story moved on at a good enough pace, although it was predictable and there weren't any surprise twists or moments that made you go 'wow'.Now that I have seen it, I somewhat sit here with a feeling of 'this is the type of sequel that never really should have seen the light of day'. This was like brewing soup off of an already cooked-out broth. Very weak storyline and an overall pointless movie.If you like the first movie "Mirrors", then I bet you will be disappointed with this sequel. But if you haven't seen the first movie, then you might just like this one. However, for a night's worth of scared entertainment, your money is better spent on "Geoul Sokeuro" (aka. "Into the Mirror") a Korean horror movie from 2003. It outshines "Mirrors 2" by a light-years, and it is also better than the original "Mirrors" movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay sequel more bloody then first but not creepy or scary!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was disappointed with Mirrors (2008) , the trailer made it look a lot more creepy then it was, that movie did have one or two creepy scenes and the acting was great for that movie and they had one really good death in that movie, i gave that movie an 5 out of 10 and I am going to give the same to Mirrors 2.This is a stand alone movie there is no connection to the first movie at all as they basically repeated the formula from the first movie but added different plot.What l liked about this movie, is that it did have some really good creative kills in this movie , this movie is more Bloody/Gory then the first however it not as creepy as the first and its not scary at all.The acting was not great at all but just Okay, they could done much,much,much better with the acting.I will watch this movie again but i won't be buying the movie on DVD. it's worth a rental at least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know that sequels are usually crap, but seriously this one takes the cake. So bad, in fact, that it inspired me to create an account here and put in my two cents. This movie has got to be hands down the worst I have ever seen, and I have seen some crappy movies. The storyline did not even follow the original. In fact, the ONLY thing it had in common with the first is the Mayflower store. The fist one had an excellent storyline, good plot development and great acting. This movie had nothing. I would like to find the writers of this sequel and give them a good high five to the face. Don't waste your time with this movie!! And to top it all off, THEY Didn't EVEN REFERENCE THE FIRST ONE AND WHAT HAPPENED TO KIEFER!!! Even the few (VERY FEW) gory parts were sub-par and made no sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe not as scary as the first, but still pretty creepy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching this at night time (which was probably why I found it creepy) and found it quite good. Yeah, this movie isn't as good as Mirrors...but it's still pretty good. I have seen WAY worse horror movies than this, and I quite enjoyed the plot of the movie. I found it hard to understand why people didn't like it. It was a good movie with maybe a little too much gore with plenty of scares and patches of boredom. I don't exactly see how this movie has bad reviews, at all??? But yes, the first movie is definitely better and you should watch the first movie first...but definitely watch this movie if you have watched Mirrors. It will complete the story a little more. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dull, boring, and quite annoying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen a good deal of movies and have never before felt an urge like this to write a review up on here. Im spending time writing this short little review so that anyone who considered watching this movie thinks twice before spending his own invaluable time like I did. The first Mirrors movie was great and I genuinely enjoyed it. It was a fairly new concept, a good thought out plot accompanied by some great effects and some good acting. The follow up... sigh*Mirrors 2 is truly terrible, a masterpiece of a crap horror movie. It seems to me the director is a man who despises the horror genre. There is absolutely no thought put into this movie. The acting is stone cold awful with zero emotion. The plot is a nanometer thick, and the writing horrific (not in a good way). At some points some of the characters seem to be plotting something of their own agenda when in reality they turn out to have no special role in the movie at all and die in the next scene. The effects of the movie were awkward, and actually made the movie less scary. I actually lol'd at one point. I can't believe the sequel was made 2 years after the original. Judging by the effects, the original seems at least 5 years older. The movie holds no true horror - just brainless gore, one scene after the other. Without spoiling anything this movie has many plot holes and logical problems that will leave the even slightly intelligent ones of us annoyed. This movie might be scary only through its unpleasantness to some people who tend to never watch horror. To those of us however who genuinely enjoy horror movies (good movies in general), this movie will just be dull, boring, and fairly annoying. Don't waste your time and look up another movie to watch. If you have not yet seen the first Mirrors and have somehow stumbled onto the sequel, I do recommend taking a peak at the first one. In any case, I guarantee you will find a better watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been watching Nick Stahl since I saw him on HBO's Carnival and think he did an excellent job portraying an emotionally distraught character who has experienced tragedy. His performance is really what makes this movie compelling to watch as he investigates further into the mirrors and the disappearance of the missing girl.The other characters in the movie were decently played as well, the sister of the missing girl, Stahl's father and business associates and of course the the janitor Stah'ls character replaced who has a little problem with the mirrors at the beginning of the movie.In conclusion I like this movie but not as much as the first one. I gave it a 6 out of 10 because it is better than a majority of the horror films I have seen recently.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless Straight to DVD follow-up, which wallows in mediocrity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this a couple years ago on DVD, and I don't remember that much about it. I enjoyed the remake of Mirrors. It was creepy and well done for the most part, so instead of doing what they should have done, and that's delve for a good script to make a theatrical follow-up, they decided to get lazy and go for the quick buck with this STD film. We actually do have an interesting lead in this film. Nick Stahl is not the problem. His complex show was riveting to watch, and I enjoyed it. My problem was the script that he had to deal with. It lacks boo scares, and the proper suspense to truly deliver. If you don't have a good script, it doesn't matter how good you are in my opinion. Final Thoughts: Watch the remake instead, and thank me later. It lacks suspense, and is instantly forgettable. It's never boring, but it's extremely mediocre. If you decide to watch it, don't expect a whole lot4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"When I look into a mirror. I don't know what's real anymore?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In some ways I prefer this sequel over the original remake. I wasn't all that keen on the Korean film either, but I found the concept of a parallel universe within the mirror an interesting angle (mirrors trapping dead souls). In some ways this sequel is much closer to the Korean film than of Alexandra Aja's original remake. The story is old hat (vengeful ghost tale), making it fairly predictable in its revelations and the jolts are over-the-top in the gore stakes (some making you cringe), but I found it to be Nick Stahl's brooding performance and the unnerving edginess of the mirror world that kept me compelled. A recovering addict due to a terrible past event takes up a job as a night time security guard at his father's department store. From the very first shift he begins to have strange visions, where he sees a women's reflection in the store's many mirrors. Soon enough freak accidents begin occurring, maybe because of her and he finds himself trying to figure just who is this young lady he keeps on seeing in the mirrors. For most part it's atmospherically cold and sterile, where the narrative runs like a murder mystery involving the supernatural and building upon a tragic central character battling his own demons while seeking the truth. Formulaic in pattern, but some set-pieces to do standout and a vivid William Katt also shows up in a small part as Stahl's father."Everything happens for a reason."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mirror image of the first one, with just as sour an aftertaste.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having already seen 'Mirrors', I could not enter into 'Mirrors 2' without some degree of hesitancy. Was I really willing to subject myself to what was bound to be blatant misappropriation of film equipment for a second time? Perhaps I was being na?ve then, when I decided to watch it anyway. "What questionable antics must the team behind this movie engage in for it to be more abominable than the disastrously substandard 'Mirrors' before it?", I thought to myself as I hit 'play' button with a tentative prod.The movie starts off, and regularly intervenes with, a psychologist discussing mental health issues with the main character, using Freud's pseudo-scientific explanations for mental illness, which sums up this whole movie if I'm honest. Compared to the logically void and seemingly parodic plot of the first movie, the sequel at least made some feigned attempts at what could be a coherent and passable storyline. Even so, the plot is still weak and prone to extensive clichés, leaving us with a story that is as predictable, if not more so, than upcoming calendar dates.This is, of course, the movie's hubris, as what might first appear to be your cookie-cutter horror techniques, soon become an endless knell of poorly executed and overused horror archetypes that abandon the viewer in a decidedly calculable experience that removes all effect the cheap shock-moments and persistently low-grade gore might have had. The shock- moments were notably lessened by the fact that you could see their approach from a mile off, due to the dependably occurring application of camera-panning to and from mirrors, just before something appears in them. It is, after all, very hard to be surprised by something you know is about to happen. Impossible, perhaps, would be a better word.Aside from the abhorrent plot, this movie seems to have inherited many of the downfalls its predecessor claimed ownership of. The acting throughout was sub-par and, once again, the script was more pertaining to the level of a ten year old's English assignment than it was a professionally executed endeavour. One actor whose sheer theatrical incompetence must not go unnoticed is a certain Emmanuelle Vaugier, who played the part of Elizabeth Reigns, the resident eye-candy who filled up the "woman with problem who needs a man to help her solve it" position that was in such dire need of occupancy. I'd like to say that her apparently terrible performance could be assigned causality due to the lackluster script, or perhaps the undeniably bland role she was given, but even taking all of that into consideration, I feel there is no excuse for the less than half-hearted realisation of her character. I'd like to say that even one of the characters gave a convincing and inspirational performance; however I am not graced with such an opportunity, nor do I wish to lie to you. Even Christy Carlson Romano's senseless and unnecessary breast exposure could not provide a superficial saving grace for this poorly executed movie.To conclude, I'd like to make the point that whilst this movie is not necessarily worse than the first movie (which is a remarkably formidable achievement in itself), it is most certainly as shoddy. I daresay I struggled to find any good points about this movie, except maybe for the singular assertion that if you are someone who enjoys obnoxiously regurgitated horror maxims interlaced with bursts of depressingly foreseeable shock moments, then perhaps you might find this movie even somewhat bearable. For the general population however, of whom I still have a slight inkling of faith in, this is one to avoid as much as the first one was. For a sequel that merely mirrored the mistakes of its forerunner, this gets a reflectively familiar two out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this direct to DVD sequel, that is actually better than the first film(!) a young man takes a job at his father's business as a security guard, while at the same time, suffering from bad memories that resulted after the death of his fiancée in a car accident one evening. As it turns out, the previous security guard was found alive, but in an extremely gruesome condition of what appeared to be self mutilation in the very same building after he had looked into a large mirror in the store. Within time, the young man learns that an evil entity trapped behind a mirror is offing the employees of his fathers business, that is soon to open up. With terrifying visions of the soon to be victims &amp; their deaths appearing in the mirror of the store where he works, the guard begins investigating the cause of these spooky going ons &amp; learns a terrifying secret behind his father's fellow employees pasts, one that seems to connect to the disappearance of a girl that had went missing without a trace one evening, a horrifying, dark past, that has now resulted in the girls spirit taking a horrifying vengeance on those connected to her death, while the girls sister &amp; hero must put a stop to it, before more victims pile up. Having seen &amp; liking MIRRORS, I was interested when I heard a sequel was in the planning stages, as a critic, I try not to expect, nor anticipate a sequel (especially of the direct to DVD variety) to top it's original, because lets face it, nine times out of ten you're going to be disappointed to learn that you're expectations have let you down &amp; that usually results in a lot of films (at least the few that are good) to receive a horrible backlash from fans. However there is the odd occasion where a direct to DVD sequel does rise above it's theatrical counterpart &amp; such is the case with MIRRORS 2, a fairly decent &amp; at times weird &amp; surprisingly scary film that manages to outdo it's first outing in many areas. The plot was interesting &amp; really good, with plenty of good, gooey &amp; gory, violent &amp; weird deaths, suspense, plot twists, good direction &amp; solid acting by a fairly attractive cast. The film-makers here prove they have imagination to spare &amp; manage to deliver an entertaining sequel that is a cut above most genre efforts &amp; their sequels. Highly recommended to horror fans. MIRRORS 2 is worth a look!***1/2 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'MIRRORS 2': Three Stars (Out of Five) Sequel to director Alexandre Aja's 2008 remake, starring Kiefer Sutherland, of the 2003 Korean horror film 'IN TO THE MIRROR'. This sequel centers around the same concept of the first film, visions of murders seen in the reflection of mirrors by a night security guard, but features different characters and an all new cast. This time the night security guard is played by Nick Stahl. It's directed by Victor Garcia (who's directed other such direct to video horror sequels as 'RETURN TO HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL' and the upcoming 'HELLRAISER: REVELATIONS') and written by Matt Venne (who also wrote direct to video horror sequel 'WHITE NOISE 2: THE LIGHT').Stahl plays Max Matheson a new night security guard at Mayflower Department Store (the same building from the first film) who takes the job where his father (played by William Katt) works after the former guard quits due to self inflicted injuries. Max has recently suffered the loss of a loved one in a traumatic accident and is still severely troubled by it. Soon after he starts working Max begins seeing images of a missing girl in the Store's mirrors as well as fellow co-workers causing themselves grotesque bodily harm. As these visions continue to become real Max tries to use his powers to prevent them and solve the mystery of the haunted girl.I never saw the original Korean film but I did like Aja's remake (which is all Aja seems to do). I do think it's probably his weakest film though. While this sequel is not as good as Aja's film it is a satisfying continuation. The mirror death scenes are haunting, the murder mystery and characters are somewhat intriguing and the acting is decent. For a direct to video sequel I found it pretty impressive. Not a great horror film but it gives the viewer what it wants.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlah-RpxRPU</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wooden Acting and a Poor Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Contains Spoilers*I won't touch on Mirrors too much other than to say I thought it was one of best horror films I've seen in a long time. It was brilliant. It was simple, it was mysterious, and it didn't try and explain itself any more than it needs to.Onto Mirrors 2. Nick Stahl didn't shine. I can't remember the last time I saw such a wooden and half hearted performance, at times it was almost as if he didn't really want to be there. It really was that bad. Emmanuelle Vaugier was the only other person with anything slightly more than a bit part, and even that wasn't too much more. It's unfair to single out Nick Stahl as nobody put in a performance that I would consider to be anything close to good. They didn't have a great deal to work with or become attached to but it felt as if it was just another pay cheque to all of them.Poor performances aside the plot is where Mirrors 2 really falls apart. The hat is out of the bag from Mirrors, we know there are spirits behind the mirrors so to be fair to Mirrors 2, it was always going to have a hard time; this however is no excuse that Mirrors 2 can use for all it's failings. It's the pretty standard concept of the spirit of a murdered victim seeking revenge on her killers, this time from within the mirrors. It is totally void of any suspense what so ever and if I'm going to be polite, it was boring. Although there was a plot it really felt throughout the film that nothing much was happening.All in all Mirrors 2 was a disappointment, I wasn't expecting a film as good as Mirrors but it could and should have been a good film in it's own right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not better than the first, but not worse! The rules of Horror sequels finally broken (much thanks to Nick Stahl)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the first feature of this rare mainstream Horror duology, I've had very little expectations. If there's one thing I believe all of us Horror fans learnt from The Ring, is that high expectations for a sequel are doomed to come crashing down. Then again, lowered expectation leave room for some nice surprises and a better viewing experience.Knowing that, I sat down to watch Mirrors 2. The first thing I was glad about was seeing the incredible Nick Stahl, one of the most outrageously underrated actors in Hollywood, staring in his own Horror film, and one that is pretty high budget and mainstream (this is not to sat that mainstream is always good, only that it's nice that when Horror finally gets another mainstream feature, it's Nick Stahl who stars in it). Absolutely magnificent in Terminator 3, Sin City and On the Inside (you probably haven't seen it, I recommend you do), Stahl brought his absolute A game to work. Again. The slightly awkward ever struggling facial expressions, the friendly relatable body language, all the fine acting that make Stahl the perfect tragic hero and everyone's best friend is all here. Simply a pleasure! Having said that, I must say the rest of the cast (Emmanuelle Vaugier and Larence Turner in particular) did a fine job as well, and it's difficult to get recognized for good acting when you're hopelessly overshadowed by an actor of Stahl's proportions.The story is not half bad, yet not that impressive. Pretty much the same as in the first film. On one hand it means that there's nothing breathtaking, special or unusually good about it, on the other hand, it's not a complete fall compared to the first. Always nice to see the rules of Horror sequels broken. As in Mirrors, Mirrors 2's story lacked any substantial plot twists, and the direction it took towards the ending felt very out of place to me. Not to give any spoilers, but when it comes to ghosts haunting mirrors - attempting to reinvent the wheel in regards to their motivations is slightly off putting.Effects are of course Hollywood-level impressive, which means all the blood and gore you fans of all things revolting and nauseating could want. I, personally, am not a fan of these, and so I find these affects to be redundant to the point of being a nuisance. Unnecessary. You hear me, Hollywood? Unnecessary. It's high time we separated Horror from Gore, they are two completely different genres, and making an audience sick to their stomach is a million miles away from making them terrified.All in all, Mirrors 2 is nothing special, nor does it need to be. Mirrors 1 was nothing special, and only specific points of the story and Kiefer Sutherland's acting made it above average. Mirrors 2 is about the same, with Stahl having no problems in filling Sutherland's shoes. A good sequel, fun to watch, scary at times, definitely worthy of your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrible movie, at times I wanted to stop watching it, but decided to watch it until the end. I think that they should have started a movie from telling a little bit about this mysterious girl. One more thing was unclear, why she did not start taking on her vengeance from the guy who killed her?Dialogues are really stupid, two policemen were really bad in their acting. Even the main character was wooden.Well, don't even waste your time on this terrible movie. There's nothing in common with the first Mirrors. They could have called this movie anything but mirrors, since visions appear on any glassy surface.My vote: 2 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad, utterly bad. Not worth watching.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot follows the first movie; main character gets visions of people dying every time he looks at a mirror and must solve the whys before everyone around him dies.I stopped watching this sequel halfway. Unlike the first movie, which at least gave Kiefer Sutherland breathing space in between each deaths to investigate and understand exactly what the hell was going on, there was too much senseless gore and too many deaths at a rapid pace in between for the main character (Max Matheson played by Nick Stahl) to understand just WHAT and WHY all of this was happening in Mirror 2.Stahl's acting is commendable in this movie, and that's the only positive aspect about this film.If you want horror involving mirrors and reflections and glass, teamed with a solid plot and in-depth characterisation, better to stick to Mirrors than this sequel. Honestly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Screening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see a screening of the movie. Mind you, I didn't see the first Mirrors. I spoke to one of the movie watchers, and she said the first one was okay, but that this one made more sense. If you like the Saw and detective movies in general, I would recommend this. I scare easily especially because I believe and have seen ghosts, so there are a few spooks as well as blood scenes. Then it becomes more like a detective show/movie, which I personally like. If you're a female and watch Lifetime Movies, I have a strong feeling you'll like this, too. There's a naked scene, which men will like. By the way, I met Christy Romano in person, and she is so cool and sweet. I even made her laugh!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>spiteful mirrors...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While driving on the road with his fiancée Kayla, Max Matheson has a serious car accident and they both die. However, Max is resuscitated and one year later he is an emotionally disturbed man with the guilty complex for the murder of his beloved fiancée and under psychological treatment with Dr. Beaumont.When his father Jack Matheson reopens the Mayflower Department Store in New Orleans, his security guard Henry Schow has an accident and Jack invites Max to be his replacement to help in his cure.Max has visions of a dead woman and he foresees death in the mirror.Soon Max finds that he has the ability to see Eleanor Reigns, an employee that is missing, and he contacts her sister Elizabeth Reigns to know details of her disappearance....Not counting the back-story of this,the movie is a virtual remake of the first. John Connor looks ill in this, and his acting isn't very good either.But if you liked the first,there is a lot of fun to be had here. It's not scary in the slightest, and the reflections are more camp than threatening, but it's still a fun direct to blu ray sequel.It's all very predictable with the revelation at the end, and for some reason it turns into the grudge, with the penultimate kill.It's another sequel that isn't necessary, but will get a lot of viewers just because of the title.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All sequels should be straight to video in my eyes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not bad for a straight to video sequel (as many of them should be done this way) Good storyline that has star Nick Stahl after an horrific car accident in which along with his new fiancée die, only he is brought back, has Max (Stahl) seeing visions in the mirrors of the place where he is a night security guard. Finding out he is actually for seeing events that are gonna or are taking place of various co-workers demises. He spends his time at night investigating as to why he is seeing these things only to find out a ghost with a tragic past is looking for answers as well. Loads more gore then its predecessor makes this a pretty watchable sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Come on, give me a break!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mirrors was OK. Especially with Kiefer Sutherland. This movie was not so good. Actually, it started out with the promise of great expectations, but it quickly sank to boring tedium. This scenario of the dead person getting someone to avenge them has only been done about 140,000,000,000,000,003 times, and better.One point that also adds to the inanity of this crap is if there was a body in the basement, everyone would be able to smell it five blocks away. Can't these dimwits do any better than this, or are they just relying on the dumbed-down generation to suck this up.Since I need more lines to post this (it doesn't deserve more), I'll add it's worse than TV shows like supernatural and ghosts. I know those are geared for the Buffy crowd, but they are still for the brainless. Hmm. Is this enough lines? If it is, that's all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the original and thats not saying much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In all of it's mediocrity mirrors 2 fares better than it's predecessor. At least this time there's a story we can follow well enough. Even though it's completely clichéd and pretty much the plot of Shutter the original and the remake with a touch of Mirrors added in. I'm not sure what divulge exactly but I guess I can say it's a ghost revenge movie. Something bad happened involving a missing girl and her spirit comes back to take revenge against the people responsible. it's all fairly generic and fright free but there are a few genuine chills and some good death sequences. The film is pretty gory with shotty cinematography and by the numbers direction. The performances from Nick Stahl slumming it and Emmanuel Vaugier are solid enough for the material and maybe a little too good for it to be honest. The film is mildly inventive as far as genre films go. It just kinda feels like you've seen this all before and it's because you have... 2.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For A Direct-to-DVD/Blu-Ray sequel it's certainly a good one !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mirrors" (2008) was a remake of the Japanese version, this time directed by the great french director Alexandre Aya (High Tension, Hills Have Eyes remake). It had Kiefer Sutherland (Lost Boys, Sentinel, TV's 24) and did very well at the cinema's. "Mirrors 2" went straight to DVD/Blu Ray which can mean two things: it's really bad or it can be surprisingly good considering it's limited budget and lack of well-known names. This time no Kiefer Sutherland but Nick Stahl (Disturbing Behaviour, Terminator 3). The story is pretty much a copy of the first one and it will remind you especially of the surprise hit "Stir Of Echoes". So no surprises there, but there are effective shock effects that will have you at the edge of your seat. And let's not forget about the awesome death scenes. The gory special effects are done by the legendary K.N.B. Effects group, helmed by Gregory Nicoterro and Howard Berger.The only flaw is that the first half of the movie is better than the second halve. But overall, it's certainly worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment and a complete waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm JUST done watching this film and I'm actually infuriated by a review earlier that said this movie's got all the spooks, scares, etc that you'd expect from a horror film and that its even better than the first one.This was a disaster, with pretty bad acting coupled with an unoriginal and pointless plot which made this an excruciating one hour or so to watch. Nick Stahl seems to be stepping down the ladder by doing a role in such a poor script.The first part was miles better although not a great film either. So if you have absolutely nothing in the world you could do instead, including picking your nose, watch it. Actually no, not even then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a totally different film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly let me say I hated the first one, there was no real storyline, there were too many souls in the mirrors and no reason for them doing what they did. However, this was like a completely different film apart from the mirrors part, it had a beginning, a middle and an end, everything was wrapped up, you wasn't left with empty plot holes. It was also a lot more moving in the story and the reason behind why? there was a few bloody scenes, I wouldn't say worse than the first one but maybe in par with. Give it a watch, you will be surprised, I was, I only put it on because I was bored and didn't have anything else to watch. Glad I did because it was worth the run time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anybody who thought this movie was close to average, must have bin on drugs when the watched it.The problem with this movie is that it sux. The problem with the film industry today, is movies like this. Has the industry lost its originality?The First movie had some good ideas, and good moments, it built up the story to a good ending. this film is just another slasher, it has no depth or thought, its like the writer just pulled a bunch of used ideas out of a barrel and strung them together.And people are still gonna rent it, and they will make more just like it =(</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In some ways more faithful to the original Korean film, and in many ways not, about the weird beings in the mirror trying to cross over.It's got great effects, some nice ideas but is so poorly placed and artificially constructed (the first weird event felt forced) that I lost interest almost instantly. It doesn't help that the lead actor is somnambulistic, a state that had me nodding off last night.A well made movie, poorly paced and in need of something exciting See either the Korean original or the first Mirrors film.5 out of 10 for the stuff that worksWait for cable</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film was very good :D, but we didn't find out why the main character guy's dads's reflection turned evil :o. It tells you why the other people did it, but what did the dad do to Eleanor! (: The film was quite scary and a lot of blood was shown! We cannot remember what happened in the first film, so we didn't really know what the people did to annoy their mirrors :S. So i think that the second film made more sense. i would like to know why the guy that ate the glass still got killed by her at the end of the movie when he didn't rape her or kill her or spike her drink or anything. we liked this film because it was funny and scary at the same time:)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than your average scary movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, it is great that there is a story, and one that makes sense to what happens to the characters in the plot. On top of that, Nick Stahl keeps you glued to wanting to see what will happen to his character, Max Matheson, next. He acts out what has happened to his character, and what his character needs to do about what he discovers, with soul. This quality, along with his ability to energetically turn on the action when needed, makes the movie much better than your average scary movie. I also thought all of the other actors played their characters well, but the roles played by some of them were done extra well. William Katt, as Max Matheson's selfish, all about business father did a super job of portraying this character. Stephanie Honore Sanchez plays her character, Eleanor Reigns, excellently , Jon Michael Davis adds extreme fright to the character (Ryan Parker ) that he plays, and Evan Jones, as his character Henry Schow, are done super well for supporting acting roles. One part that could have been changed though, was a scene that could have been hinted at instead of showing so much, which would have made the whole movie a ten. I skipped it the second time I watched it, and then the movie was a ten. There are some truly hold onto your stomach scenes that add treeeemendous suspense to the moment. Add that to a great storyline that made sense,( which all takes place in clearly lighted, up to the moment settings), and an ending with an outcome ( instead of wondering what the heck just happened ), and it gets even better. Then add the quality of the acting of Stahl, some great support acting, and you have an excellent movie that's a ten out of ten for its genre. I found this movie to be so excellent, I had to buy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy followup, what Aja's movie should have been!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This follow up to the somewhat disappointing 2008 film, Mirrors, is in my opinion a worthy successor and in many ways better than the first. Out of the gate, the kills are very good and in higher quantity. There are beheadings, disembowelments, and lots of creative use of the mirrors to ramp up the tension. I liked the backstory, though a little familiar (think Stir of Echoes), and thought Nick Stahl gave a credible performance as the disturbed protagonist. The CGI is tasteful despite the movie's premise, not overused. The special effects and makeup were spot on. I would definitely suggest giving it a try, there are far worse films out there, and if you liked the first one or the original Japanese film it was based off of, then you are sure to enjoy the sequel. This is what Aja's film should have looked like to begin with.BestMaddis</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK this movie was really really bad. I decided to give it a shot, since i liked the first movie. I mean those mirror images can be really creepy!Well in this movie they are NOT. The scenes with the mirror images where not scary and it even made me laugh a few times. This also had to do with the acting, which was the baddest acting I've seen in a movie for a long time. The 2 main characters are both terrible. Especially the woman Elizabeth (Emanuelle Vaugier, baddest actress ever.. On top of that the film was evolving around an unoriginal and boring plot, the script was bad, the dialogues where awful and also the direction and editing was really bad. You will notice the scenes when u see them and will think What? Completely messed up....Funny thing was i enjoyed the last 15 min or so. Think it has to do with that it involved the only 2 characters who did a decent job with the acting. (Stephanie Honore and Lawrence Turner)Skip this movie if you can. It is a real borefest and i almost fell asleep.</fullReview>
