		<shortDescription>Mirrors: much better than you'd expect of a horror remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mirrors was pretty much doomed for terrible critical reviews from the start. Horror never scores big with film critics; in fact I can't remember the last horror film that got more positive reviews than negative. If the horror film in question is a remake, especially of a foreign movie, it's almost destined for critical failure. There's a reason for that: most horror remakes are utter garbage and are solely created so studios can make a quick buck. However, once in a while, a horror film remake will come along that actually isn't half bad, yet will still suffer negative reviews based on the fact that it's a horror film remake. It happened several years ago with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and more recently, with The Hills Have Eyes.Mirrors has suffered a similar fate. Directed by French horror director Alexandre Aja, the same man behind The Hills Have Eyes, Mirrors is a remake of a Korean horror film, as well as the best wide-release horror film of the year thus far. While I'll admit I probably enjoyed the film much more than most will, it's still miles better than the critic's lousy reviews or lackluster promotion would have you believe.Kiefer Sutherland stars as Ben Carson, an ex-cop suffering from emotional issues after a "workplace accident" and a messy divorce. Sick of sleeping on his sister's couch, he takes up a job as a security guard at an abandoned department store that was devastated by a fire many years back. The job seems easy enough, primarily consisting of walking through the building every couple hours, making sure there are no trespassers. Things take a turn for the worse though, after several strange encounters involving the mirrors in the building, and Ben begins to find that his own reflection is haunting him, not only at the job, but in any mirror or reflective object (or liquid) he comes across. Soon enough, Ben find his life, as well as his families, in danger.Mirrors biggest strength is the storyline, easily one of the best horror premises to hit the screen in years (even if it is recycled). Reflections are practically inescapable, not only appearing just in mirrors, but in doorknobs, windows and water. The inescapability of reflections is what makes the idea of one's reflection out to get them so chilling. They're everywhere. You can't escape them. Not since Nightmare on Elm Street, where ones own dreams were the cause of death, has there been a supernatural premise that has gotten so much under my skin. The fact that whatever the mirror images do to themselves happens to their real life counterparts, only heightens the hopelessness of Carson and his family.Alexandre Aja has already proved his ability to create genuine scares with previous films, but most have been of the brutal, violent kind, as opposed to the atmospheric chills usually employed in supernatural horror movies that are more reliant on the mood and feeling than shocking acts of brutality for scares. Surprisingly, Aja's penchant for gore and violence complements the film surprisingly well. The sequences inside the derelict department store at night build up suspense very well, utilizing the eerie location with corpses manifesting themselves within the mirrors and screams emitting from within deep recesses of the building. It's fairly generic stuff for movies like this, but Aja is talented enough stylistically to pull them off. However, it's the sequences where Aja really lets loose that prove to be the most frightening. One sequence that takes place in a bathtub ends up being one of the most brutal and unsettling death scenes of the year. There are several of these sequences sprinkled throughout the film and they are extremely effective, utilizing a combination of brutality and atmospheric suspense that are, at the least, shocking. When a ghost pops out in one scene, it isn't a pale, long black haired Asian woman, nor a semi-transparent floating apparition: it's a half-naked female with half her body burned off, the flesh still sizzling off her burnt carcass as she wails in pain. That's the difference between Mirrors and most other ghost films.The biggest downfall of the film is when it tries to provide an explanation for the horrific events taking place in the second half. The idea of one's image terrorizing oneself is horrifying on one level, but at the same time, it's extremely unrealistic. Trying to explain why this happened back fires on the film, as no explanation is going to make sense and instead, will just draw attention to the fact that this would never happen in real life, destroying a bit of the film's effect. The audience doesn't need to know why this happens. Ambiguity in this case would be much more frightening and wouldn't take away from any of the other scares. Once you throw in a sub-plot about mental institution experiments and haunting tragedies taking place in the building, you lose a lot of the suspense. Despite the unwise direction the movie takes in its second half, it's still entertaining and manages to retain a few good scares here and there, while finally rebounding in the last act.Mirrors isn't perfect (what film is?), but its strengths far outweigh its weaknesses and in the end, it's the most enjoyable wide-release horror film of the year (although personally, the only other decent wide-release horror film this year would be The Strangers). Benefiting from a brilliant premise and the unlikely combination of French director Alexandre Aja's love of blood and brutality with an atmospheric, supernatural storyline, Mirrors is definitely much better than what one would expect of a typical Korean horror movie remake, let alone any horror movie that hits theaters.- Dylan, allhorrorfilms.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>These days, at over $10 per movie ticket, the question I most ask when I go to these review boards is...was it worth it? The answer to that question depends upon how effectively the movie brings its genre across to the audience...the interesting plots, the action sequences, the drama. Yes, perhaps I've seen the movie's take on these things before, but to me the movie's worth is defined by the movies own merits, not necessarily the merits of what preceded it...We have I think all seen variants of what Mirrors is about, yet I still recommend it. I found it to be atmospheric and suspenseful (with some gore, one effect in particular will probably make your jaw twitch for the remainder of the movie), although the suspense wears off once certain things are revealed about 3/4 of the way through the movie. The atmosphere remains intact however, and the ending of the movie delivers an unexpected twist that brings the movie full circle. While I'm not likely to see it a second time, I found a single viewing to be a worthy investment of my time and my $10.50....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First half: Great. Second half: The opposite.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying: I was stoked about seeing Mirrors. I liked High Tension, and I loved Hills Have Eyes. Both were awesome, awesome movies....especially Hills Have Eyes. So of course, again, I was stoked to watch Mirrors, because it sounded interesting, it looked scary, and the guy who made to great horror movies made it. What happened when I finished Mirrors, you ask? I was left disappointed as hell. Very, very disappointed. Which sucks because it started off so scary and so interesting. Kiefer Sutherland plays Ben, a down and out ex-cop who's battling an alcohol problem and the stigma of killing a man while in the line of duty. While waiting to be reinstated into the police force, he takes a job as a night watchmen at an old, burned down, creepy-ass shopping mall. Of course, once there, he notices insanely scary and creepy things going on inside, particularly with the mirrors inside. He starts seeing disturbing things in the mirrors: People burning alive, grotesque people lying on the floors, crying for help, things of that nature. Since Ben is so unstable, we're not sure what's going on, at least I wasn't. I wasn't sure if all this scary stuff was in his head, or if there was a genuine explanation for all of it. Well, I was wishing that the former was true, because that would've made the movie that much scarier and that much edgier. Instead, the latter was true.The movie has some really, really scary parts....all of it is scary until they explain why everything's happening. Then you're just left there thinking, "Well, that's not that scary anymore." There's some really crazy gore effects, especially the opening scene and the scene with Amy Smart. These parts, especially the Amy Smart scene, will make you cringe just a little bit.But after the first half, the half filled with mystery, intrigue, and scary, horrific moments, the movies take a turn down dumbass-idea boulevard:SPOILER Ready for this? The reason for the all the strange happenings in the movie, i.e., in the mirrors, is because of.....ready?......demonic forces. No psychological reasons, which would've been cool and interesting, but because of stupid demonic forces that lived in the mirrors. Even if they didn't go down the psychological route, they could've at least handled it better and made it interesting instead of just saying, "Bad s*** lives in the mirrors. Jack Bauer's gonna take care of it." When his wife starts believing him and when you know for sure he isn't just crazy and broken, that's when all the interest is sucked away.Everyone does a pretty good job with their roles, but since the movie doesn't get any deeper than "Bad stuff lives in the mirrors," there's not much to do with these characters, especially Ben, who's a pretty broken and messed up guy. But as the second half comes along, you forget that he's a recovering alcoholic with a pill problem who may or may not be completely insane. When there's no more doubt about his state-of-mind and sanity, the movie loses it's punch and mystery, at least I thought so.SOME MORE SPOILERS The movie takes a turn for the absolutely ridiculous when all the demonic forces in the mirrors manifest themselves in an old nun. She pretty much turns into a freakin' licker from the Resident Evil games. She starts crawling up walls, jumping off walls, and gets into a physical brawl with Kiefer Sutherland as he tries to shoot her. She throws him through a freakin' brick wall, and he throws her like six feet away from him. I was just thinking to myself, "What the hell am I watching? Is it still the same movie?" This part was so stupid it pretty much ruined the rest of the movie. My God. It was so stupid. I personally thought they could've done much more with the story instead of just saying "Bad things live in the mirrors." It started out scary, suspenseful, and frightening, but then just ends up being corny and stupid. The only thing that made the last half somewhat tolerable was the last few minutes, which was a little shocking and cool. Loved the ending.But again, don't take this review as a definitive view on the movie. Go watch it for yourself and you might end up liking it very much. I didn't, even though I really, really wanted to.Score: 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When a reflections does not reflect reality one can expect fatalities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a remake of a Korean film of 2003 this film tells the tale of a guy that picks up a job as a night-watchman in what is left over of a burned down department store. What starts as a somewhat dull somewhat creepy job quickly turns into a living nightmare.There have been at least a dozen horror films where the evil lived on the other side of the mirror - nothing new here. Most of them share the same build up as this one: get to know the victim(s), get to know the evil(s), see them getting maimed/slaughtered/eaten one by one - nothing new here. In effect, this film is like nothing new all over and it would be a standard run of the mill one if it weren't for the fact that most of the settings used are worked out pretty nicely and that the ending isn't the normal sloppy one.I haven't seen the original but I am interested into seeing it now that I have seen this one. It might be even better.7 out of 10 mirrors on the wall</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but it could be better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mirrors is the U.S. remake of Korean horror movie Geoul Sokeuro, it is good and scary but not as much as the original one. The movie is about A mall security guard becomes wrapped up in a mystery involving a particular department store's mirrors which seem to bring out the worst in people. The story is almost the same as the original as well as the plot which are interesting although a little predictable. It has a good rhythm and the tension grows in its intensity as the movie moves along, these are two very good things because it never makes the movie tiresome to the viewer. The cast is good, Kiefer Sutherland gives a very convincing performance, although he reminded me of Jack Bauer in some moments of the film. Amy Smart's role was good but very short and Paula Patton as Kiefer character's wife gives a decent acting job. In conclusion, it was a good movie but it could be better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit I was on my toes. It's one that gets better and better as the movie goes. It keeps you wondering and there is pretty much no foreshadowing at all. I really didn't know what was going to happen from minute to minute. This movie is one of those you'll want to watch again. Sutherlands performance is good but I've got to give props to the other actors as well. All their performances were pretty remarkable too. I'm not the type of person that enjoys crappy films. I definitely have to say I know a good movie when I see it and I'm confident of that. The overall twist and turns... yeah it's a definite popcorn lights off cuddle with your boyfriend scary movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better horror movies these days</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is certainly not the best horror movie I have seen but out of horror movies that come out now of days it is one of the better ones. The death scenes were a little over the top and gory but at least the movie didn't really on mostly gore that a lot of horror movies these days do. Keifer Suterland was pretty good and there were a few jump scares. I like it that they added a little bit of mystery to it. I give this movie a B for effort. It did seem a little long though, they could have made it at least a little bit shorter. They had some cool special effects like when the mirror got shot and the holes repaired themselves. Overall it was not that bad of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Promising Beginning, Disappointing Resolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In New York, the former NYPD detective Ben Carson (Kiefer Sutherland) is hired to work as night watch of the remains of the Mayflower Department Store that was partially destroyed by fire many years ago. Ben became alcoholic and was retired from the police force after killing a man in a shooting. His marriage was also destroyed and now he is living in the apartment of his younger sister Angie (Amy Smart). However he has not been drinking for three months and sees the employment as a chance to rebuild his life. When he goes to the rounds in his first night, he finds that the mirrors are impeccably clean and his colleague explains that the former night watch was obsessed by the mirrors. After a couple of nights, Ben sees weird images in the mirrors, but due to the lack of credibility of his past, his ex-wife Amy (Paula Patton) believes he has hallucinations as a side effect of his medication. When Angie is found brutally murdered in her bathtub, Ben discovers that there is an evil force in the mirror that is chasing him and jeopardizing his family.The first half of "Mirrors" is intriguing, with a promising scary story with good special effects and good performances. Unfortunately, the resolution and the conclusion of the plot are very weak and disappointing, and the end is open for a sequel. The death of Angie is really the most impressive scene of this forgettable horror movie. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Espelhos da Morte" ("Mirrors of the Death")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One word....Frightening!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love when a movie really makes my hair stand on end, this one did it for me throughout. There are so many twists and turns, and the ending was very unexpected. All the characters were believable and Kiefer Sutherland's performance as the inwardly tortured ex-cop teetering on the edge of insanity was excellent. If you rent this, definitely view the unrated version, I yelped out loud a few times. I would definitely put this in the category of supernatural horror guaranteed to scare the s___ out of you. It's really quite intense, and even though most horror movies don't really scare me (I actually laugh at most and find them to be more comical than scary), this is not a movie you want to watch just before going to bed. You might want to watch it during the day, just so you can filter it out later, otherwise you might be dreaming about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly effective horror films!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe it's because I only heard bad things about this film. Practically every review said "disappointing," "skip it," etc.So I got the DVD not really knowing what to think. I really liked Haute Tension and I like Kiefer Sutherland. Though the trailer made this look like Jack Bauer and Kim stop a mirror terrorist attack.But once the opening credits started (with that great pre-credit scene), I was hooked.Never once was I bored, and there were quite a few times I jumped out of my seat.Maybe others figured out what the plot was all about, but it took me by surprise.I found the film eerie, suspenseful, scary and well directed and acted.And that house! not since Event Horizon have I see a production design so impressive! It was like another actor in the film. The people behind that work deserves an Academy Award, in my opinion.I also loved the ending. Very un-Hollywood and while in retrospect it probably didn't make a lot of sense, somehow it 'felt' right to me.All in all, I found this a refreshing take on a horror film... and considering the villain was a piece of glass, It think everyone did a great job.Not sure why others didn't like it as much as I did, but all I can say I found it a very satisfying experience, and will probably watch it again one day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ludicrous empty nonsense from someone who should know better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh dios mio, Alexandre, what have you done? Alexandre Aja is a talented director who has a splendid visual sensibility that can breathe life in otherwise tired premises. His version of The Hills Have Eyes features one-dimensional characters and a predictable storyline, but Aja elevated it thanks to its garish, glorious appearance. High Tension also looked great, and had a similarly premise, but was doomed by a lunkheaded twist. His second attempt at a remake, a Korean horror film, was destined to be a failure. The vague Asian ghost story has long since run its course, and it can be argued that only the movement's catalyst (The Ring) was successful. Mirrors is a profoundly troubling film, if only because you wonder how such a talented man could pump out such a dud.The trouble begins right from the start with an uninspired opening. The film proper begins, with an opening credits sequence that is dizzying in the worst way, like the projectionist fed the reels wrong. Kiefer Sutherland stars as Ben Carson, an officer disgraced after killing a colleague. He is living with his sister (Amy Smart), and is estranged from his wife (Paula Patton), mother to his two children. He gets a new job as a night watchman for an old department store that was destroyed in a fire. Around here is when the questions start. The film's first third mines a lot of attempted suspense out of extended scenes where Sutherland is wandering around looking at old burned things, mainly statues, birds and mirrors. None of these are inherently scary, bringing to mind Dark Water, where we supposed to be terrified by bad pipes and a faulty washing machine. If Aja's seem less ludicrous, just wait. All of a sudden, in a manner more awkward than shocking, he starts having fake-looking visions of people burning, so Sutherland screams and hilariously writhes around. AAAHHH FIRE OH MY GOD Not coincidentally, this is the point at which derisive laughter began to emanate from the patrons of my theater.The plot after that set-up is...honestly, a bit hard to explain. Characters are introduced, utilized in situations that would seem to encourage a fleshing-out, then are never heard from again, and are underused even in their minute facet. Despite the film being based upon another medium, in fact another FILM, Aja and co. seem to have no idea where they're going or what they're doing, to the point that they seem to be making it up as they go along. Every major occurrence in the film was laughably silly and gloriously incoherent. First off, isn't his job description merely to just protect the place from vandals? He's taking crazy pain pills and is still disturbed anyway, so why, after his first unpleasant bit of silliness, would he go wandering around to the waterlogged basement and to the empty reaches of the top floor? Are punk kids really breaking into this place and going to all these crazy obscure places? Can't he just sit out front? He runs home, screaming to his loved ones how mirrors are attacking him, and is somehow surprised when they think he's a nutcase.From there, the film provides all these bizarre twists about a mysterious woman, and a mental ward and the fire and mirrors and demons and...it's all curiously empty, to the point that I can't honestly conceive how they managed to fill 110 minutes of film. Oh, there's one big gore scene, but the film had lost this crowd long before it, and it ends up smacking more of desperation than anything else. It kept me entertained just because I wanted to see the nonsensical depths it would plumb, and boy did it deliver. By the time he's abducting a nun at gunpoint and wrestling her demonic corpse (in a scene that somehow makes even less sense than everything that occurred before it), all the rules of believability or genuine enjoyment were out the window, and the film ends as incoherently as it began.In the acting department, it's just as bad. Sutherland is horribly over-the-top (and his character is such an ill-tempered dick that we can't possibly sympathize with him), and everyone around him doesn't know how to act. Amy Smart, the only competent actor in the cast, is dispatched early on, in a scene that later is contradicted, as the film can't even follow it's own rules. Paula Patton was obviously cast for *ahem* other talents, so why they continually give her extended emotional scenes is beyond me. The kids are kids, the rest are forgettable and forgotten (Jason Flemyng is introduced early on as an important character, as the film seems to be setting up a tangent where Kiefer is suspected in his sister's death, but this is as forgotten as everything else in the film).The film's original conceit is one that is if nothing else intriguing, but its only scene with the potential for genuine suspense (having someone look into a mirror, look away, and have the reflection stay) only works once, and only if you're not expecting it. But this film not only uses it extensively with most of its main characters, announces it in its title and plot, and utilized it in its marketing almost wholly. I could continue in this vein for another twelve paragraphs, but I think the most demonic thing about the film is that its influence has apparently gotten to my brain, because, reading over this, I don't think I've accurately conveyed WHY the film is bad, or at least why it deserves the rating I'm about to give it. In an attempt to inform you, I've also blathered epic-length with little effect. Curse you, Mirrors, your tremendous downside has doomed me to work as incoherent and meandering as you. God help us all.{Grade: 0.5/10 (what is that, a high F?) / #64 (of 65) of 2008}</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Haute Tension is one of my favorite movies. Hills Have Eyes &amp; P2 kept me believing that Alexandre Aja was on the road to something big.Really big.Now usually I don't judge too harshly if an artist slips up &amp; makes one or two stinkers so long as they rebound &amp; hold steady. Mirrors already had several strikes against it. Another remake?Come on man. Kiefer Sutherland?Really?! Yet I pressed on its Aja if anyone can turn these strikes into lightning its him. Wrong.Wrong.Wrong. This movie falls victim to every horror movie cliché &amp; makes some new ones for good measure along the way(anyone count the number of times the word mirror was used just in the 1st 1/2 hour?!). There's zero chemistry between the actors. There's no tension no build up of suspense. The horror moments are laughable like the Grudge 2 House of Wax &amp; The Amityville Horror. Christ im about to put the final nail in the coffin on this man being the future of horror over this. I log on to IMDb to see what his next project is &amp; its yet another remake. He pulled a Wes Craven in just under 5 years. I know I haven't written any details on the movie &amp; its because I cant its just too idiotic &amp; honestly hurts my head to recall what I just suffered through. Mr.Aja please get out of the gutter &amp; get back into making kick ass horror movies.Please?!?!?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Major spoilers perhaps present. -- A night watchman(Keifer Sutherland), once a detective who accidentally murdered an NYC cop while undercover, is taking an obscene number of drugs to kick his lingering alcohol problem stemming from the unfortunate crisis which removed him from the force. His duty is to periodically check throughout the damaged ruins of a once lavish mall overcome by fire due to a supposed nut-case who set it afire hoping to destroy the mirrors which occupied the entire establishment. What this watchman, Ben Carson, never imagined is that the "lunatic ravings" of a man, who claimed that the mirrors were responsible for the murders of his family, would actually be true! Soon the mirrors target their intentions towards Ben and his immediate family, estranged wife, Amy(Paula Patton), son and daughter Michael &amp; Daisy(Cameron Boyce &amp; Erica Gluck), and particularly bartender sis, Angela(Amy Smart). Like those plagued by the mirrors before him, such as the film's opening victim, the night watchman he replaced, Gary Lewis(Josh Cole), Ben will face a harrowing crisis..stopping whatever evil lies behind the mirrors hoping to uncover the secret so that he can save his family from harm. When his own attempts at destroying the mirrors fail, Ben discovers that the evil force wishes for him to find "Esseker", and so his pursuit begins.There are some things I enjoyed in the theater from Aja's latest dud to hit theaters unwelcome(..why is Fox releasing this film in August instead of October, where a much greater opening would've at least came?). The Mayflower mall at night is really a spooky place...and a perfect "haunted house" where mirrors and horrifying cries of victims are used to supreme effect as Ben and his flashlight comb the darkness for discoveries. The idea of finding yourself completely vulnerable to the demonic forces that can kill using reflecting mirrors, and foretelling just how little room for escape there is because "mirrors are everywhere". Two gruesome deaths are presented unflinchingly..a victim's throat is sliced with the wound opening up in ghastly fashion thanks to his evil reflection(..not by his own hand which makes the kill even more outrageous)&amp; a victim whose face is ripped apart from her mouth(..ouch!). There are creepy scenes where a reflection remains in it's stance even as a person moves away from the mirror(..nice visual effects for these sequences). But, the film's final 30 minutes or so as Ben discovers that a mental hospital was once underneath the Mayflower for psychiatric patients by a doctor using a peculiar technique with mirrors(..to free the evils plaguing those burdened with such psychological traumas as schizophrenia), and that a particular patient, perhaps possessed with demonic forces, was released from there, Aja's film treads familiar territory. And, the final climax between a certain nun discovered who might hold the key to his family being saved, as they make their way to a secret room, walled up by brick due to the Mayflower mall, and Ben's family finding themselves in a supernatural battle with the evil working through the mirrors, really tests our threshold for accepting such contrived and ludicrous situations. The screenplay does whatever is humanly possible to save Ben's family even though we know that if the evil behind the mirrors really were allowed to, they would've killed them all. And, when a certain nun agrees to help Ben, and is overcome by evil, it's the same old cop versus demonically possessed human except with explosions and toppling stone and pipes. And, as one realizes that Aja just can never resist, there's a twist at the end concerning Ben's fate which is a yawner. Aja really needs to get out of this Hollywood studio system that is raping him of the skills he might possess. And, could someone PLEASE save Amy Smart from such dreck. Man, Sutherland gives everything he has to this role and I applaud him for his efforts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad reflection of where mainstream US horror movies are at</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexandre Aja's "Mirrors" is a sad reflection (did I actually say that?) of where American horror movies are at -- at least the ones getting wide releases. Of course, much better stuff like "Inside" gets dumped straight to DVD because A)It's not "American", B)The French characters don't speak "American", and C)It's too "extreme" for horror fans(!). This film from the overrated director of "The Hills of Eyes" is just depressing. Keifer Sutherland, who can't do anything with a terribly obvious script, starts work as the night watchman of an abandoned department store in New York. He starts seeing weird images in the surviving mirrors in the old store and is soon telling everybody around him that the mirrors are out to get him. What the hell made Alexandre Aja think that this would make a scary movie, let alone a good movie? It's the worst idea in recent history. It does for mirrors what "Dead Silence" did for puppets. There is a ridiculous backstory that tries to explain what's going on in the mirrors, but you won't give a flaming f*** as you try valiantly to exorcise the insidious boredom from your brain. The film has half a dozen climaxes and gore that belongs to another movie. It's a misfire in every department. Aja's sense of judgement stinks, so I'm not looking one bit forward to his "Piranha" remake. The genre is scraping the bottom of the leaking barrel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mirrors: A Waste of Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that a movie like this can easily be summed up into one word: Atrocious.First thing that I would love to get out of the way, is the completely obvious attempts at anything considered "horror" were as cliché as possible.With examples such as the typical "omg a bird just flew in from out of nowhere, I was totally not expecting that", but almost not as bad as the "wow, this cgi is completely unrealistic". There were parts where I thought that I might possibly get a chill, and then as the anticipation grew, I was left with a disappointing "Oh".One part in particular was the scene inside of the dressing room where you're waiting to see what's behind the curtain, and you're sitting there saying to yourself 'Oh god Kiefer don't use the mirror to see what's there!' and then when he actually does do it all you think is- Wow, it was entirely more scary when we couldn't see the face or...anything else for that matter.One aspect that I preferably enjoyed was the atmosphere. The old singed up mannequins were a very nice touch, and also the mirrored room from the hospital added an extra "House on Haunted Hill" type appeal; Which, I thoroughly felt was aesthetically pleasing.Last but not least, I failed to mention: 'the ending'. I almost felt myself getting interested in the movie once I realized Keifer was now behind the mirror. And then before you know it, the movie ends. I just sat through how many god awful hours of nonsensical hullabaloo, when it just abruptly ends with no real consistency.I find it hard to give this movie anything higher than a 2 rating... Mainly because I spent most of the movie saying: "F*** you Keifer". And after the movie, I imagined Keifer receiving letters from viewers all around the world with statements such as that and him sighing in remorse, mumbling: "...not another one". --With these thoughts came my only content. Listen, if you want to see this movie because the preview looked appealing, don't let it fool you. It fooled me, and a lot of other people. Most of the people in the theater rushed, if not trampled each other, in efforts to escape it asap. If you feel you must see it, please for your own well being, wait for the DVD release.But, even then, I wouldn't even give Kiefer the satisfaction of taking a diarrhea dump on this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Objects in Mirrors are closer than they appear...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexadre Aja, the man behind the intensely creepy 2003 film High Tension and the intensely crappy 2006 remake of The Hills Have Eyes has now brought us something in between. Kiefer Sutherland adds credibility to the otherwise unoriginal horror film Mirrors, about an exiled New York City cop who soon finds himself battling a mysterious force hidden behind every reflective surface that is endangering his sanity, his life, and the lives of his family.The movie opens with a terrified night watchman running for his life. From what, we don't know, until he begs forgiveness from a mirror for trying to escape. The mirror cracks angrily in response.There is a strange force in Mirrors that is able to torment members of the living, or members of the three dimensional, or members of whatever land the mirror-forces are unable to occupy. It is at least an hour and a half into the movie before we learn much of anything about the deadly force that is tormenting Ben Carson (Kiefer Sutherland), and that's more than a little too long.Ben Carson has recently been put on mandatory leave from the New York police department after a tragic shooting, and his life is increasingly spiraling out of control. Not the least of his worries is the strange fact that the only job he is able to get is as a night watchman, a caretaker, if you will, of a department store that burned down five years earlier.I'm a little confused about that whole setup, by the way. The building is standing but is nothing more than a skeleton of its former self, and is clearly beyond repair. What is a nightly caretaker meant to do? Upkeep is obviously unimportant. Are they worried about teenagers or homeless people wandering in? Isn't that a job that, say, a good fence can do?It's definitely the worst job ever, but it's a great setup for a horror movie. A guy under tremendous pressure is forced to take a job where he has to wander through an enormous, burned building every hour or so in the middle of the night. Personally I would walk off the job and quit as soon as the mirrors showed me on fire, but not Ben Carson. He didn't start browsing the classifieds even when he learned that his predecessor suffered a mysterious death involving mirrors. This guy has balls of solid rock!Complicating the matters of Ben's unraveling professional life is the fact that his wife doesn't want him coming over to see his kids without calling first, he's an alcoholic, and his sister, who is providing him with a sofa to sleep on, is a bartender. This guy needed professional help before the mirrors started talking to him! The scenes inside the derelict department store are actually pretty effective, but it becomes clear very early on that far too much stock is put into the scares of his nightly walk-throughs and not nearly enough put into developing a real story. There's a story, of course, it's just that the movie feels like a lot of Funland Haunted House tours intermixed with an occasional break to explain a few things, and then back to the haunted house.A good horror movie will either make you fear something that previously seemed harmless (like the dark or hallways or dolls or children or the like), or instill in you the fear or interest that there might be something more going on right under our very noses. Mirrors attempts to do both - to make us fear not only mirrors but all reflective surfaces, which are all dangerous in the movie, and also to suggest that there is a whole other world going on behind those mirrors, that those pesky handprints that won't wipe off are really someone on the other side with their hand on the glass.I doubt that the movie will succeed in making many people afraid of mirrors, although it did have a fair amount of good scares and a genuine feeling of tension when it was supposed to. Naysayers will balk at the idea of paying real money to watch Jack Bauer scream at his reflection for two hours, but even though this is basically a strange combination of several previous movies and there's not much original going on, you could definitely do worse. It's a major improvement on the horror movies that we've seen released in the last ten years or so. I had started to lose faith completely in the entire genre. Mirrors is not going to save the horror genre from being sacrificed to the box office gods, but I'm happy every time I see a scary movie these days that doesn't star a lot of sorority girls in halter tops and idiot pretty boys.But for all of it's weaknesses, as a creepy horror film it's hard to say that Mirrors isn't successful. It might even be a pretty good date movie, although there are dozens better that you could watch at home. But the ending, I don't mind telling you, is better than everything else in the movie, and it's almost worth going to see it just for the last five minutes. Horror fans, if nothing else, will enjoy picking out the homages?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can I watch the reflected good version of this movie now please?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mirrors is a little gem of a movie. Its entertainment value is almost limitless. Although I actually wanted to cause myself physical harm while watching it, I can't deny that I was utterly entertained... I haven't laughed this hard in months. Seriously, you could invent a drinking game around this film - take a swig of the hard stuff every time the script does something unintentionally hilarious. I guarantee you'll be drunk quickly.I should warn that the following brief synopsis contains spoilers (though how exactly anyone could do anything to further "spoil" it is beyond me).It starts off intriguingly enough, with a satisfying and gruesome opener involving the murder of a night watchman by his own reflection. We're then introduced to Ben Carson (Sutherland) - an ex-cop who is (*deep breath*) washed-up, personally-troubled, ex-alcoholic, fighting-for-his-kids-in-a-failing-relationship, battling-anger-management-issues and haunted by his past killing of a man (you don't need to remember any of those character traits by the way, they never actually have any relationship to the plot of the movie, they're just stuffed in there without reason).Carson takes a job as a night watchman in the Overlook hote- oops I mean the Mayflower - which is a burnt-out, flooded, mannequin-infested, department store built on the site of an old Indian burial gr- oops I mean - on the site of an old abandoned psychiatric hospital (fortunately, for the intrepid Mr. Carson - the contractors neglected to demolish the old hospital but instead just bricked off the creepy parts and built the department store right onto the side of it (contractors these days... unscrupulous I tells ya!). In a thirty-eight minute long info-dump, the prior watchman explains to Carson precisely how the place burnt down (which is surprising as this fact also has no relationship to the plot either) and then leaves him to his own devices.Almost immediately (in the most hilariously unsubtle haunting reveal ever) Carson finds himself witness to disembodied screams and burnt apparitions (apparently on-loan from 'Silent Hill'), and is badly cut by a cracking mirror. He also spends thirty painful seconds thinking he is burning to death (painful for the viewer I mean, not the character).The film logically should have ended there with Carson sensibly saying "F#$@ this place!" and resigning. That could have spared us all the next 1.5 hours, but sadly, Carson is both intrepid and astonishingly stupid and he proceeds to wander around exploring further.I could attempt to tell you more - to reveal a plot-arc that makes sense perhaps - but sadly from here everything gets a little vague. In the one moment of the movie actually worth watching, Carsons' younger sister has her lower jaw torn off by an evil mirror version of herself and Carson realizes that whatever supernatural forces are at work in the Mayflower will kill his family unless he unravels the mystery.He proceeds to follow the images on the video tape to a small farm where there is an old well and an odd black-haired demon girl that crawls out of TV sets... no wait, I mixed it up a bit there... but there *is* a demon girl, honestly. They even borrowed Linda Blair's contact lenses from The Exorcist and the shaky head cam from Jacobs Ladder to prove it.This girl grew up to be a nun who is hiding from the evil forces that now reside in the mirrors (although, in reality, I think she was actually hiding from the screenplay. Alas, it found her in the end). All of this is revealed in a stunningly incomprehensible way - with masterful use of deux-ex-machina, info dumping, throw away characters, and leaps of logic that would make the writers of "Twin Peaks" proud. It's all good though, because by this point you're laughing so hard you're beyond help anyway.But it's the conclusion of the movie that elevates it from merely terrible to a true art form. After a mirror explosion shown from (count-em) SIXTEEN different angles, Carson then must fight the Pit-witch from "Army of Darkness" but without the help of a trusty chainsaw. He holds his own though, and after an excellent fist-fight with the hellspawn, he impales it on a conveniently broken gas pipe, says "Bennet, Let off some Steam" and blows it up. A mad dash through the erupting building finds him safely in the outside world again... or is he really just... Dumb Dumb DAHHHHH!... *inside* the mirror. Crescendo, cue end credits, house lights go up, all members of audience older than eight stare at screen in slack-jawed disbelief...Rent it. No... BUY it. Get your friends together and do your own "Mystery Science Theater 3000" style overdub party. It's rare that a film this bad is born folks; don't waste a golden opportunity!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy of the year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was the comedy of the year! Seriously, I've seen comedies this year, but nothing made me laugh harder than this. There was an unintentional joke just about every 5 minutes or so! And the audience in my theater seemed to agree with me on that. I was never the only one laughing.This takes the place of "THE HAPPENING" as the single worst movie I've seen in a long, long time. The acting was so ridicules it was like they were reading their scripts for the first time as they read their lines.Overall: - It gave boring a new level. Out of the 110 minutes, 90 were either a talking scene or a scene of awkward staring. It reminded me of Napoleon Dinomite. There were literately 2 minutes left in the movie and people couldn't bear it anymore and walked out! - It gave cheesy horror a new meaning. At one point the ENTIRE AUDIENCE burst out laughing at how cheesy one scare scene was. (It was the scene with the dead man turning his head.) Every other scare scene had at least one person laughing other than me. And there were like 50 cheap, cheesy scare scenes.- 57 clichés! I sat there and counted every cliché and it added up to 57! Add to that: the plot and characters were copy/pasted from movies like "THE RING", "THE GRUDGE", and "THE EYE". Exact same plot lines. Exact.- Gore? What gore? A chick rips her jaw off, but the CGI is so laughably bad it was no more effective than old Godzilla movies. Plus, haven't we seen jaw ripping in PG-13 movies like "THE GRUDGE", anyway? There was NO gore in this movie. NONE.Beside the horrid things I just mentioned, all the good parts were typical. Typical atmosphere, typical exposition, typical mystery (that was copied/pasted from "THE RING"), typical characters (I can't name how many times I hear in a horror movie, "I have to save my family!"), typical story layout, typical camera angles, typical EVERYTHING. The only things that weren't typical were the things it got horridly, utterly wrong.Go see this movie if "PINEAPPLE EXPRESS" doesn't make you laugh enough, and you'll have a blast. If comedy isn't your thing and you actually think this is a horror movie, may I suggest an episode of Barney to give you shivers?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BLATANT SPOILERS FOLLOW.This movie made no sense from start to finish. I mean, the recovering alcoholic and his estranged wife bit was fine, but the meat of the thing--the horror, its cause, and its final defeat--was completely illogical and incoherent. Here's an example: We start off the film watching the previous nightwatchman get dispatched by the thing in the mirror. This is accomplished by having his reflection cut his throat with a broken piece of glass. We find out later that the piece of glass the nightwatchman was physically holding in his hand was completely spotless when found by police, which means it was not used to slash his throat. Somehow the reflection was able to make its reflected version of the glass do the dirty work. Similarly, when Amy Smart gets her jaw ripped apart later on, it's not done with Amy's hands, but magically, simply by force of will or something on the part of the reflection. OK, you say, so what? I can swallow that. Well, here's the thing: There's a scene where Kiefer sees himself burning in a mirror and then feels the agonizing sensation in his own body. He rolls around on the floor as if burning up and we see the flames spouting from his body in his reflection. But when it's all over, THERE'S NO PHYSICAL DAMAGE! Here's another: Kief sees a burned up woman in a burned-out dressing room. She's so badly burned her skin is still boiling. Yet what do we see hanging on the wall of the dressing room she's in? A perfectly preserved and pleated dress. She must have loved that dress and shielded it from the fire with her body or something. (To fully understand the absurdity of this, you probably have to see how totally gutted the department store is in general. But when you do, you're going to scratch your head over the dresses and curtains that somehow made it through the fire with nary any smoke damage, much less burn marks.) One of the funniest sequences has to do with the old nun who it turns out is at the center of everything. Kiefer goes to her convent and is forced to kidnap her at gunpoint to bring her back because she is absolutely dead-set against releasing the demon from the mirrors, no matter who has to die. That's funny enough in itself, seeing Jack Bauer kidnap a nun at gunpoint while uttering some absurdly lame cliché like "Don't make me do this." But even funnier is the way she does a complete 180 by the time they get back to New York and just can't seem to do enough for old Kief and his family in the very next scene. The Stockholm Syndrome figures big in this one, I guess.There are many, many more absurdities I could cite (the problems with the ending could fill a book by themselves), but I'll stop here. Suffice it to say, this movie is a complete mess. It really has no redeeming qualities whatsoever, unless you just shut your brain down entirely and ooh and aah over the cheap gotchas that Aja depends on to provide scares that his script can never manage. Mirrors is a prime candidate for some future Mystery Science Theater episode.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I would give this a rental</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The easiest way to explain my 3 out of ten is by saying " Hollywood has run out of places to put demons". It's a typical cliché from start to finish. It starts with a soon to be ex-security guard of the mayflower being murdered by (come on guess) mirrors. We see him running from something, though immediately we don't know what it is. He soon gets cornered ( because he decided to run underground in a subway) and comes face to face with a locker room full of mirrors. So the klutz dies and that brings us to Sutherland. He's an ex-cop who prefers popping pills than just getting over his problem. So why is he popping pills?Well apparently he killed a guy and turned to alcohol which destroyed his family. Now he's depressed and trying to get over his alcohol dependency. He goes into his sister's room, basically to wake her up and tell her he's leaving, then tells her to go back to sleep. That was my favorite part. I like when people wake you up then tell you to go back to sleep. I would've been like " no, make me breakfast". So from there it's a bunch of B-roll till he gets to his future job. He grabs the job of being a security guard and ,almost immediately, we see things aren't too kosher.Blah Blah Blah bunch of horror scenes Blah Blah Blah sister dies Blah Blah Blah he teams up with Mr. Hyde Blah Blah Blah. He goes crazy at some point ( or so people think, because he tells everyone " the mirrors are coming, the mirrors are coming") and decides to find some supposedly,dead chick. He finds her, shoves her into a room full of mirrors, and that's when the demon comes out. They fight and the place goes to hell and fire and rock and explosion and blah blah blah.Well in the end, we see our hero stuck behind the mirror. Which, I'm sorry to say, was the best part. The rest of the movie was just crap. It was full of Cliché and a bad romance story. The best actors only popped up for a split second. I saw Jason Flemying for like two seconds. It was pretty much a ego trip for Kiefer. I don't recommend seeing it in theaters, but if you have netflix or something cheap like that, wait for the DVD. I'm not saying " don't go see it", I'm saying if you have nothing to do some Thursday night and you're home early, rent it and you'll get a few laughs at how cheesy some parts are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deeply Disappointing Horror Homage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Alexandre Aja is a member of the so-called new wave "Splat pack" of horror directors, and a self confessed disciple of the genre.Despite a good basis for a story, a credible cast, and a very generous budget this film fails to deliver.It is a long time since I went to a Horror Movie and found myself looking at the time DURING the action sequences.Whilst the cinematography and locations are fine,a preposterous script makes the cinema goer cringe with embarrassment rather than with fear.Convincing horror depends upon the viewer being convinced that the extraordinary can come from the ordinary, this test is failed in spades. Frustratingly the ingredients are not bad.Kiefer Sutherland plays a solid, Ben Foster, a Cop suspended from duty for shooting dead a fellow officer.However the mental anguish of the event is eschewed in favour of the demons that apparently haunt the backs of the mirrors in a dilapidated fire ravaged building for which he is a Night Watchman.When the action is largely confined to the fire damaged department store, an interesting, if routine level is found.Once the action goes outside all plot credibility disintegrates.Afficiandos of the genre will be pleased to know that there is the obligatory nude/ bare breasts/ girl in the bath scene acted by Amy Smart playing fosters sister.We even have a wet t shirt scene acted by Paula Patton playing Fosters sister.But just when the rationale and logic of the malevolent ghosts in the mirrors is "cracking up" it gets worse.Foster identifies the root cause of the problem, a cured schizophrenic Nun whom he kidnaps at gunpoint from a Nunnery without challenge or consequence and persuades her to happily give up her own life in favour of Fosters anonymous family.The coda "plot twist" is a mere device, clever but shallow.Less money, but more characterisation,less gore and more threat are required next time round for Aja.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recovering alcoholic police detective (is that enough clichés for you?) Ben Carson (Kiefer Sutherland) has lost his job for accidentally shooting a police officer dead AND has left his family to recover (really piling it on here). He takes a job as a security guard for a huge department store that was burnt down. Starngely the mirrors in there are fine. He soon starts seeing "horrific" images in the mirrors and realizes the mirrors will kill his family if he doesn't help them! No--I'm not making this up.PLOT SPOILERS!!! Laughable premise isn't helped by a script that has holes galore and incredible leaps of logic. OK--the spirits in the mirrors want Ben to help him. So why brutally kill his sister? Why go after his family? HOW do they know where his family is? If they need help why not plainly tell Ben (through writing on the mirror) what they want instead of killing people? Also why are they looking for just one person when they can (seemingly) possess anyone? Why don't they go after the other guard working with Ben? That's just scratching the surface of the improbabilities! Also Ben's sister (well played by Amy Smart) gets killed when she's nude in the bath! Gotta mix that gratuitous nudity with violence. And Ben's wife (Paula Patton) is soaking wet by the end--so we can clearly see through her clothes! This movie doesn't miss a trick. The ending makes very little sense too. There is tons of atmosphere in the burnt down store but seeing Sutherland wander aimlessly throughout it for minutes on end gets boring quick. Also, at 110 minutes, this is far too long.On the plus side it IS well made and the acting is good across the board. Sutherland and Patton especially are great. The special effects are excellent too. But this can't help a boring, overlong and stupid horror film. I give this a 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me say something, I love mirrors, aren't they just wonderful at times? I mean, when you're looking hot, you just can't stop starring at yourself, it's a great pleasure. But what if those mirrors contained ghosts?! Not only that, but killing deadly ghosts! Oh, no! Great, we have another horror movie that takes the most simple and basic every day item we use and turns it into a scary thing and now we can't look into the mirrors because if you're easily scarable, then you're going to have a few bad hair days. Mirrors is another Asian remake, from a film I believe is called "Look into the Mirror" or something like that. This was one of the rare movies where I looked at the trailer, besides knowing that it was another remake, it looked interesting, so I saw it today in the theater, unfortunately, it turned typical, great story, but why did it have to get predictable? It could have been so much more.Ben Carson is a former NYPD cop who had an accidental shooting, he's also a recovering alcoholic who is trying to get his life back on track and wants his family back. He gets a job working at a burned down department store as a security guard. But then as he looks into the mirrors, strange things start to happen, he starts seeing things in the mirrors of people burning, him dying, and now the spirits are going after his family. The only way he can prevent their deaths is if he gives the spirits what they want, the only person they can jump into and get into the outer world.Mirrors is better than most Asian remakes, it does have some good scare moments, it has actual gore in it that will make you cringe. Amy Smart has an awesome death scene that is just horrific to watch, you'll just have to see what I mean. The ending is also kind of cool, like a Twilight Zone episode. I love Kiefer Sutherland, I love this guy with a passion, he's a great actor that still needs his big due on the silver screen, but he should have done a little more with his character in this story. One thing I'm sick of is a sane rational person starts to see ghosts, and they start screaming at people expecting them to believe as well how they're seeing ghosts and that someone is in danger. Mirrors is worth the look, I'd just recommend waiting for the rental, it's a watchable movie, just nothing special.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Horror Effort That Begins To Shatter Near The End.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mirrors" focuses on Ben Carson (Kiefer Sutherland), a police man separated from his family who is living with his sister (Amy Smart). He takes a job as a security guard/patrolman of an abandoned New York department store that was horribly burned in a fire. Once a lavish, very high-class building, now all that remains are charred walls and mannequins. But after working there for only a short while, he realizes something about the massive mirrors left in the building aren't quite right - he sees apparitions and has strange experiences that become more and more disturbing. It seems something from the mirrors is trying to tell him something, and reflections become deadly as those around him begin to meet their demises in very bizarre ways. What ensues is a battle against time as Ben attempts to unravel the mystery behind the presence that is held within the mirrors before it gets to his family.From Alexandre Aja, French filmmaker who brought us "High Tension" and "The Hills Have Eyes" remake, "Mirrors" is an offbeat little shocker that kind of came out of nowhere. With a fairly well-known cast, it's surprising how little build-up there was to the film's release. In fact, I hadn't even heard of it until hardly a month before it's release when ads hit television networks. Nonetheless, I went into it with an open mind and not expecting much, after the advertisements had me thinking "Hm, looks a little corny", and I didn't think it was half bad. The entire premise, while it is a bit far-fetched in terms of realism, is a neat little exploration into the supernatural with a strange bent to it, in which the antagonistic presence lurks within mirrors and reflections - it could be nearly anywhere.The visuals are neat as well and the immense abandoned department store, charred and black, has an eerie, 1950s-feel to it what with the old mannequins and classy mementos that were left in the building after the fire. Atmosphere-wise, this film had something going for it, as well as a story that was halfway original when compared to the overall crop of horror trash that is pumped out carelessly to audiences (e.g. the "Prom Night" remake, etc). There are a couple of nasty gore scenes too (Amy Smart's bathtub scene was one of the most cringe-inducing things I've seen at the cinema in a long time, and probably one of the biggest highlights of the film), and while Aja is known for his on screen carnage, that isn't the sole basis of the movie. In all reality there are only two really violent scenes.The acting is decent, Sutherland is a good actor and carries the movie on his shoulders. Paula Patton plays his concerned wife well, and familiar face Amy Smart has a rather small role (with a rather big scene) and does a good job. Now that I've gotten going, I will say this movie is in no respects perfect. It suffers from some pretty obvious clichés and suffers with predictability in a lot of aspects, and those "Why are going down there, you're begging to die" sort of things which are pretty consistent throughout the flick. There's some pretty big plot holes present as well, and by the time the film had reached its climax with the demonic nun- monster-thing, I felt the explanation behind the events (which is what the whole film is leading up to) weren't presented in the best way. Like a shattered mirror, I thought things sort of fell apart near the end. There's the obligatory twist as well, which was sort of unexpected and had a neat visual spin to it.Overall, "Mirrors" is a decent effort from a director that has brought us some pretty good movies. It's a lot different from Aja's other stuff, and I like that, but I felt as the movie progressed things got a little sloppy. Still, this is better than most horror flicks of late, and makes a good popcorn movie to kick back and see with some friends. It's got some solid acting and neat visuals to keep the audience engaged, and the climax, while at times a little too far-fetched for me, was nonetheless clever and intense. I think "Mirrors" may suffer more so with movie-goers because fans of the director may have been expecting something closer to his previous works, when in reality it's quite different from what he's done before. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flat, uninspired horror film with intermittent unintentional laughs but with action that picks up in the last third</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Carson (Kiefer Sutherland) is an ex-police detective in New York whose alcoholism made him incompetent on the job and caused him to kill a man. Now he's trying to get his life in order. He's living with his kid sister to save money. He's taking medication to wean himself off the booze. Most important, he's trying to win back the trust of his estranged wife, a medical examiner, and maintain a loving relationship with his two young children. To make money while waiting for reinstatement, he takes a job as a night watchman at a department store gutted by fire. That was a mistake. He is soon tormented by the same supernatural mirrors that plagued his predecessor. The images in these mirrors do not reflect reality as we know it. The images will stare back at you, but remain in the mirror when you walk away. The images will even try to kill you. Soon, Ben Carson finds that the mirrors' demons follow him everywhere in every reflective surface. They're willing to harass him and his family until they get what they want. Ben's job is to find out exactly what that is.This silly horror movie, based on a Korean film I haven't seen, shares several things about Asian-inspired supernatural tales that I dislike. The demons at first seem limited to a single space, but then later prove they can follow you wherever you go. They'll follow the protagonist, attack him, attack everyone he knows. They seem bound by certain limitations at first, but then it seems they can pretty much do anything they want - which makes all the running around, running away and desperate investigations into old records and dirty secrets seem pretty pointless. This one has lots of the usual gross-out effects (especially in the unrated version I saw), including a hideous and prolonged jaw-ripping scene.The movie starts out flat and uninspired, and makes too little use of its main set piece - the burnt-out department store. Every line of dialogue is prosaic and sounds like something we've heard a hundred times before. The music is clichéd and slightly intrusive. There are intermittent unintentional laughs. The action picks up in the last third, which makes things less dull, but even stupider than before.</fullReview>

As he discovers how a mysterious nun , once-possessed named Anna Esseker is also found lingering about the crime scenes and she tells him about an asylum where seriously ill patients were subjected to mirror-based shock treatment. Without wishing it, Carson is drawn farther and farther into the deep mystery surrounding the astonishing deaths.Alexandre's Aja remake of a Korean movie titled ¨Into the mirror¨ is made in American style. It packs,tension,suspense,chills,horror and lot of blood and gore including slitting the throat,attempted rage, slicing ,stabbing, all courtesy of Robert Kurtzman, Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger. They create a creepy make-up of horrible and bloody images. The gutsy murders are gruesomely executed and equally as graphic as the original movie.The film is constituted by a well done terror set pieces with creepy and spooky atmosphere.The mirrors's reflections appearance deliver the goods with hair raising chills and full scares.The story is borrowing from the original Korean film , taking and ripping off numerous scenes. Thrilling musical score by Javier Navarrete including a leitmotif based on a Spanih classical music and appropriate cinematography by cameraman Maxime Alexandre. The motion picture is skillfully directed by Alexandre Aja, though with no originality because it is a simple reworking . Aja is an expert on terror genre as proved in the new version of ¨The Hill have eyes¨ and ¨Switchblade romance¨ also titled ¨High tension¨ and in post-production realizing ¨Pira?a 3D¨. .The film isn't apt for little boys,neither squeamish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have seen the ring, you have seen this film, just replace the TV and phone calls with mirrors. It amazes me that with its notable lead role actor, its obvious large budget, that people such as Sutherland risk their careers on films people usually make early on. the special effects were below par for this kind of production though, you could clearly see when the computers kicked in producing the new mirror image, may have been better to green screen and re-overlay (also note to runners ensure all background inconsequential items in mirror exist in real world also otherwise the reflections fail). Sutherland was great, as for the rest, they were..good enough, no one else stood out as being exceptional. Now that I have finished moaning, overall its worth watching, but you will be have a familiar feeling about the whole thing, and the basic plot line is farcical...you will find yourself saying "you wouldn't do that" too many times for my liking. but I don't know where this tiny little piece of inspiration came from from an otherwise unimaginative screenplay, but the last 2 minutes sequence puts a nice unpredictable (twist is too strong a word) quirk which makes you forgive a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Keifer Sutherland stars as a suspended cop who takes a job as a night guard at the burned out hulk of a department store. Once a grand jewel of consumerism its now a wreck, a fire five years earlier has resulted in a battle with an insurance company and the building sitting waiting for repair. Sutherland soon realizes that strange things are happening with the mirrors and that several of his predecessors have met with bad ends. Looking into the matter he soon finds himself and his family in danger.Another remake of an Asian horror film, this time from Korea (The original is called Into the Mirrors and is different enough not to warrant too close a comparison). Directed by the man responsible for the French High Tension and the recent remake of the Hills Have Eyes this is an occasionally creepy little film that works better in theory then in actuality. For me the problems come down to two things. First I never warmed to Sutherland. There was something about him that kept me distant from him. The other, more serious problem is that the film isn't internally consistent with its logic (A logic that works better in the original). For example How can the evil move from mirror to mirror when it seems tied to the mirrors at the department store? There are other burps of logic that had me asking why instead of getting creeped out by what should be a terrifying story. Don't get me wrong there are things in this film that work and there is a certain amount of tension created with the idea of this mirror world, but at the same time some of it just doesn't work, or at least work in the framework we're presented with. For me this is more of the same from the director who's previous films sort of worked and sort of didn't, his High Tension's final twist is a complete destruction of internal logic in order to have a "cool twist". His films are worth watching but not at what it costs to go to the movies these days.Worth a look when its cheaper then ten bucks a head.</fullReview>

Bath Scene, sister gets jaw ripped off! laughable (i Actually did) maybe i'm being a bit harsh on this film, the first 30-40 mins are actually OK and then descends into a little bit of a farce, it seems the writer must have run out ideas and then lost the plot (just like you will) Spoiler alert again!!! The Nun? why????? as for the ending, nice attempt at a twist but failed miserably! Summary: OK film, No scares (except pigeon) good 30 mins or so, bad second half lost plot... the end!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wish someone had warned me about this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so I have seen a lot of horror movies and therefore I've naturally had my share of bad horror flicks. But I wasn't prepared for this one. I liked the Japanese version and I thought that it wouldn't hurt to catch the remake. After watching this movie, I'm still waiting on that remake. Oh yes, the two movies may have a few similarities, but the people behind the American remake decided that they could it better. In which they were wrong.This movie starts up with the Japanese storyline about a ex-cop who has been in a shooting that didn't end well. We don't really get the whole story behind that shooting... Well, this cop gets a job as a night watch at a mall where a fire was several years ago and it still hasn't been restored (unlike the Japanese version). Weird things then happen to the ex-cop at the mall. So in spite of the fact that the movie has undergone several changes in form of American clichés, the movie remains to be a remake of the Japanese version. After that it seems that the movie (with Keifer Sultherland's monotone acting in the front seat) slips away from the original version and into it's own little world filled with dull scenes, more clichés, a fair share of gore and a storyline without sense. And just to top things off, they try to end it like the original version. But with their own confusing storyline that ending doesn't make sense anymore.At first I struggled to not stop the film right away. Then I realised that this wasn't a remake of the original movie at all and got confused with all the horror clichés in it. I must say though that I really liked Paula Patton as Amy Carson, so that kept me watching a bit longer.All in all I actually wished that I hadn't watched that movie. It was the worst I have ever seen and advise that people only watch it for the acting of Paula Patton and Amy Smart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very weak result considering what the idea implied..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, my first movie comment. But on a bad one though: Actually I'm a big fan of mystery/horror haunting movies, but Mirrors could not give anything to me what it promised, i.e. shocking results of the idea of haunted mirrors. In the opening scene i was quite satisfied with the realization of the idea "reflections doing reversed things", but with the fast pace of the storytelling all became more and more futile: Very stereotype things there as the interracial relationship, k.Sutherland having lost his job because of drinking, living separated with his wife, no real character depth neither for his wife or the 2 children (Michael loses big time against any of the 6th sense and ring-kids..), no one believes him, taking pills = seeing weird things.. And yes the fast pace of the story: all of a sudden his sister dying through the mirror grudge (relation?) - and what a stupid exaggerated scene with her breaking out her jawbone.. (done 100 times more shockingly in "the orphanage) (by the way jawbone in German means "kiefer" (so funny ). Then, also all of a sudden help from everywhere, a story unfolds, and then comes the mystery lady (flashbacks also appear quite borrowed from ring, grudge, exorcist etc. ..) Anna. Oh yes, first he visits her relatives (of course, again stereotype, comical country guys, showing him everything he wants. 24-like trained he manages to get to the girl, now old lady, who maybe responsible for the hauntings.. and she is a living nun. OK, she doesn't want to help, so he points a gun at her and forces her and of all a sudden she wants to. meanwhile his family, logically, is fully haunted (movie's already finishing..), just because in the house are also mirrors. ..And water of course, also reflects! WHy the boy is haunted so badly by then, i really cannot say. And the once so schizophrenic nun helps: she (we have to think) dies in an imploding mirror-room, where she was put in her childhood. (because the haunted burned building was a former mental hospital of course) -and -again - all of a sudden all mirrors implode/explode and everything is fine. Ah wait, no another exaggerated scene to come. She now is a monster and flies through the room attacking Mr. Sutherland. But at the end he kills her. Steps out of the building, and OK, i admit (also good idea (why not more of these..?) everything is reflected. So we can assume Kiefer S. now is a Ghost. This gets a 4. I promise to review a 9/10 movie next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>mirror mirror on the wall,nearly the worst one of all!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the (misleading) trailer for this movie I really anticipated seeing it and thought for sure I would love it.Man was I wrong! It started out good until the stupid storyline about the 12 year old girl who in the early 50s was thought to be schizophrenic,but was possessed or something stupid like that which we have seen so many times it has really gotten old.I am disappointed that the producer &amp; writer would write something that lame into such a promising new script.It went from a good spooky &amp; atmospheric thriller with nice visual and good special effects in the first half, to downright laughable and pathetic in the last half when the story about the possessed girl who later becomes a nun came into it.This part of it made no sense.There was absolutely no reason for the possession at all.Like other people said,it would have been better to not have an explanation about what's in the mirrors and leave it ambiguous.But since the writer had to add a reason it would have been better to make the possessed 12 year old a boy instead of a girl so it didn't come across as yet another exorcist "ripp-off! When I read about this movie in various articles I thought it was going to be mainly focused on Ben Carson (played by Keifer Sutherland) and his troubled past.Other than his drinking there really wasn't a past.There was some bad dialog but Keifer Sutherland was pretty convincing and did a good job.I thought the movie would be more along the lines of the reflections in the mirror showing the ugly sides of themselves and making them do bad things to the people around them and their loved ones.There wasn't a lot of chemistry between Keifer's character and his wife &amp; 2 kids, and the roles were badly cast.Also Amy Smart at first came across like she was his girlfriend instead of his sister. There really were not a lot of characters in the film to begin with,but if the film focused more on character development instead of adding the asylum and later exorcism, then it could have been an awesome psychological horror movie.The movie should have gone deeper inside the mirrors.The burnt &amp; abandoned department store looked extremely creepy, and the scariest moments in the film were of being all alone with only a flashlight in that huge evil place and all the mirrors.There was enough tension &amp; fear about that alone and all the victims that were burned to death to make a better plot.This movie is based on a Korean movie called "into the mirror",which was typically another Asian horror movie about a murdered female who's vengeful spirit wants justice.I read director Alexandre Aja didn't connect with the Korean film because everything was seen before in the ring &amp; grudge etc.Well now that I have seen "mirrors", it is still nothing new especially because of the direction it took in the last half.I really wanted to like this movie and strongly believed he could deliver a horrifying movie after seeing the incredible remake of "the hills have eyes", and the brilliant "hight tension".I was very disappointed because of the potential the story had. The ending was a bit of a twist, but it ended just as the movie got interesting again which was maddening! Unfortunately I won't be adding this to my movie collection,but Alexandre has made some great horror movies and I have no doubt his next film will be a success!</fullReview>

It makes me very much doubt the original talent he seemed to show. This is simply crass. The frightfest audience (who loved his earlier movies) laughed at it and treated it as comedy by the end.

		<shortDescription>A Disappointing Third Horror Film from a Promising Director?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mirrors" is the third horror feature directed by young and aspiring horror maestro Alexandre Aja. Now, as a fan of the horror genre I enjoyed both of Aja's previous films quite immensely, despite their flaws, and was greatly anticipating Aja's take on the supernatural side of the horror realm. Asian horror films are a major target of movie studios nowadays and their remakes flood the market with mostly poor results. "Mirrors" itself is a remake of the Korean horror film "Into the Mirror". While Aja's remake is more interesting than quite a few of the more recent Asian remakes (such as "The Eye", "Shutter", and "One Missed Call"), it is still highly flawed and ultimately disappointing, especially since it's from a director I've come to admire. Let's start with the acting department.Kiefer Sutherland carries the film by himself at times, most notably the first 30 minutes or so. Once the film continues, Kiefer's acting bounces in and out of believability. Sometimes his acting feels forced and other times his reactions are laughable. The rest of the supporting cast does virtually nothing to help Sutherland. Sutherland's wife, played by the beautiful but immensely untalented Paula Patton, is perhaps the most irritating character during the 110 minute journey. I must mention, however, Amy Smart's brief role in the film. She is easily the most intriguing character inside of Ben Carson's (Suthland's) horror story, yet she is only in the film for a brief time before she is (in rather gruesome fashion) taken out of the picture.One of the films' most notable flaws is its a times' extremely weak executed CGI. In one scene, Sutherland is tricked by a mirror and believes he is "on fire". The resulting scene is one of the most ridiculous and laughable in the film. Several other effects scenes in the film seem rushed as well and come off as ineffective.The story is also disappointing since many threads are left hanging and the ending, while trying to be clever, is ultimately unsatisfying. Half of the film seems to be in a mental hiccup and much of the movie's runtime could have been cut down in order to better service the story and attention of the audience.Despite my major disappointment, I must say Aja's directing and style wasn't a problem. Every scene shot within the confines of the "Mayflower" has haunting and creepy. Aja states his biggest inspiration while working on "Mirrors" was Kubrick's "The Shining" and it becomes evident with how he manages the atmosphere within the burned building. Aja also gives us a few scenes of great gore, but this is easily the most tame of his works yet. Thus, another disappointment since many horror fans will be expecting much more bloodshed.The films' score was one of the biggest surprises for me and will probably be missed by many viewers. I found myself listening to Javier Navarrete's score during many of the more uninteresting scenes.All-in-all, "Mirrors" is a heavily flawed film that held much promise. In the end, Aja relies to much on cheap gimmicks for scares and doesn't spend enough time on other important elements of the film. Although I'm undoubtedly frustrated in his latest effort in the horror genre, I will still line up for whatever Aja makes next since I believe this could have been a thorough learning experience for the still young director.Related Recommendations: 1408, Stir of Echoes, A Tale of Two Sisters, The Ring, Ringu, Dead Silence , The Haunting, The Shining</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>These Mirrors don't reflect much...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...in a word, awful. I was eagerly anticipating the film since I had seen the trailer with The X-Files back in July. Ever since I saw the trailer, I have been shaking with excitement, and so I obviously was really excited to see this.After leaving the theater I was left INCREDIBLY disappointed. I wish I hadn't wasted my money and time seeing this trash. What's even worse is that this is directed by Alexandre Aja, the guy who directed the brilliant "The Hills Have Eyes". This is incredibly shocking since that movie scared the living crap out of me.Kiefer Sutherland plays Ben Carson, an ex-cop who is in self pity over having murdered someone. As an alternate job, he takes over the job of a night watchman in an abandoned department store. In his late night shifts, he discovers that the mirrors are haunted with a demonic force. It becomes clear that through disturbing images and messages, the mirrors want something from Ben. This force begins to haunt Ben and his family until it gets what he wants.Granted, the creepy parts look beautiful and are eye candy. However, that doesn't mean that they aren't good enough. As for the scary and intense scenes are a joke. Shaky camera, constant edits, camera too close, in some of these scenes I felt nauseated.The 2nd half is especially bad. Ben switches to Jack Bauer mode to stop this demonic force. The entire plot is changed by then. A lot of the gore is INCREDIBLY fake! Especially the quick camera shots, which makes it feel like you're having the seizure the whole time.Overall, this film fails in its' weight, while having a good concept and story. Wait for the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Decent, nothing special.Pros: cool ending, cool plot, decent acting.cons: meh. What to include.1) The main character (Ben, played by Sutherland) refused to get a day job, so he got a night job instead. Reason? Not given. So that night job was the most important thing in the world but we have no idea why. Good move.2) The mirrors go crazy on him the first day of the job. I was expecting something more subtle, as opposed to the "1408" mess. Smaller indications over a longer period would have been more effective. Especially when it comes to the wife. Instead of seeing the kid in the mirror and immediately crying/panicking, she should have blinked a few times, and the mirror would be fine, and slowly gets worse over time.3) if mirrors will kill you, are you going to paint over them and then let them stay there? I certainly hope not. I would bury them and break them all.4) I'm not a fan of the nun/exorcist basis. I was really hoping the mirrors were feeding off people's fears, and the day-guard was providing fresh meat. Sadness.5) When Ben discovered he could destroy the mirrors outside the department store, I expected him to bring all the mirrors out and destroy them. But nooo. Silly goose.Oh well. Other than that, it was decent. The graphics were OK, and the opening in particular was fun. The bathtub scene was unexpected and made me twinge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A man and his family are terrorised by a supernatural force that is using mirrors as a way access their home. I welcome Kiefer Sutherland with open arms as he's in the land of TV far too often. Although he seems to lack the great range of his father Donald, he is a great underrated actor. Mirrors gives Kiefer plenty to play with, but as with so many Asian horror remakes that have been spat-out recently and while Mirrors is one of the better re-workings, the story twist is something we've seen too many times.No stranger to remakes director Alexandre Aja (The Hills Have Eyes re-do and 2010's Piranha 3-D) takes the viewer though paint by numbers stuff as Ben Carson (Kiefer), a former undercover detective, is forced to take a night time security job at a department store that was gutted by a fire. However, there is an evil lurking in the mirrors, an entity he must stop to save his family.Lately, I wish all the PC's in the world were stolen so I wouldn't have to see another dodgy effect detract from an actor's performance. While some effects are modest it's the bad CGI that spoils some moments of scariness. When practical effects are used there's one moment that would stop you ever looking into a mirror and taking a bath again.Jason Flemyng shows up for a brief moment but seems to take his pay cheque and disappear as fast as some of the eerie atmosphere. Between Paula Patton and Amy Smarts (almost a cameo appearance) the acting is above average right down to the child actors who are at no time annoying.Overall, Kiefer leaves his mark and it may not be the most original horror but at times it is certainly is creepy, not since Poltergeist and Poltergeist 3 have mirrors been so chilling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see a sneak preview of MIRRORS, the new horror film from French director Alexandre Aja, who also gave us HAUTE TENSION(HIGH TENSION) and the remake of THE HILLS HAVE EYES.It stars Kiefer Sutherland(24) as a former New York City cop, working as a security guard in a burned down department store that is being reconstructed. There he discovers a sinister demonic force inhabited in the mirrors of the store that not only endanger him, but also his family and friends. Sutherland must discover and stop the source of the evil that are in the mirrors before harm happens to his family. The film has the usual shocks and gore coming from director Aja and Sutherland plays the lead with same determination as in his role as Jack Bauer in 24 and the rest of the cast like Amy Smart give solid performances. There are a couple of effective shock sequences in the film, especially in the beginning sequence and in a nasty bathroom scene involving Amy Smart, but the film is predictable, especially in the way the film resolves itself in the ending. The audience I saw this film with, kinda guessed how this film was going to end. But even with it's predictability, the film is an OK crowd pleaser that might satisfy today's horror film fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The mirrors. They're so clean.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mirrors is the American remake of a little known Korean film called Into the Mirror. The plot has Kiefer Sutherland as a recovering alcoholic cop, who whilst on suspension is taken to working as a security guard at a large burnt out department store and starts to see terrifying images in the many mirrors about the place... You would think that Mirrors was a flop. The critics hated it and the horror hordes were very much divided on it, the latter of which is to be fair the norm for any big horror movie release. Yet it didn't flop, it did very well at the box offices of the world and has a decent 6.2 average on IMDb, which for a divisive horror film is well above average.Mirrors overstays its welcome, there really was no need for it to run to just under two hours in length. While elsewhere there's some pretty poor dialogue, parts of the screenplay are pointlessly soap opera in nature, while some thinking will make you scratch your head in bewilderment at events outside of the brilliantly monolithic department store.However, does Mirrors create a genuinely spooky atmosphere (the interiors of the store are creep fest nirvana), insert some shock moments to jolt you out your seat? Is it visually stylish, with sound work to match? And does Sutherland (and to a degree Paula Patton as his wife) overcome the trite parts of the script and give effective and committed performances? The answer to those questions is yes.Does the ending cop out in any way? Insult the audience? No! It doesn't do that either.It has flaws, but they are not insurmountable for the horror fan who's just looking for some good scares, atmospheric dread and some stylish touches from the director (Alexandre Aja). If you haven't seen it then give it a try, judge for yourself, you might be pleasantly surprised at what you find. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat imaginative but mostly boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mirrors is a horror movie with two upsides: it has a fun premise, and Kiefer Sutherland. He's a security guard in an abandoned building (fun to see that not all horror movies start with a family moving to a strange old house) and sees scary ghosts in the rubble. Turns out all mirrors and reflecting surfaces in the world are out to get him.After this, don't expect a lot from the story. To break the curse and convince his family that he's not crazy, poor Kiefer must research the terrible past of the ruined building. The plot doesn't really lead anywhere interesting, the scares are cheap and the visuals dull. Still, it's not quite so bad as to be a complete waste of time.Can't imagine why this got a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really, Mr Aja? Have you not had enough of CGI yet?Where do I begin - the protagonist is not likable not because he does not have to be but because he is such a temperamental moron, meaning the character writing failed. His in-movie ex-wife is wooden and cannot act to save her life or for that matter her role, bless. Actually, all of the cast seem quite inept.It is a movie that could have been. Could have been suspenseful or gory or shocking or enjoyable, etc. Only it got ruined by a plot pulled out of a donkey's rear, high school graphic effects and characters constantly overacting and it just did not know where it was going. As such it is simply stupid.Also, Mr Aja, do we really need a self-indulgent loop-ending each time you make a movie? Enough of that already, time to grow up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is 5th November, year 2012 and i have been watching a lot of horror movies lately. After watching 26 all time best movies with ratings higher than this one, I can undoubtedly say that Mirrors(2008) stands first.This definitely is not for the weak heart people. I must say you should avoid if you are in the habit of watching comic-horror movies like this year's cabin in the woods which are a waste of time.There are many scenes that are more than disturbing. I have seen some people say 'shit in the pants'. Well, if you saw it like me, alone at night with a great earphone, you will feel the scare too !! Repeat : Must watch for a true horror !

		<fullReview>First the movie is terrible, I would have given it a 1, if not for the only thing that the movie has going for it, which is that you just want to know how this mess is going to end, and let me tell you, the ending is horrible. The story is very week, the acting is a little better and although all supernatural movies need vast stretches of your imagination, this story just dos not add up. The horror scenes are not scary at all, they look more like a bad gimmick, the only one that was worth seeing was the opening scene witch gives the impression that you are getting ready for a treat, but all goes downhill from there. Horror is one of my favorite gender, but a good movie should alway contain a strong story, or at best be very entertaining. This one fails on both counts.Recommended: definitely NOIf you already have seen MIRRORS, I would recommend this other movie just to state a point: THE BOX, it is not the best of all movies but at least it makes you think, and question the different aspects of the story, Good or bad.This almost 2 hour atrocity just left me filling bland.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Damnit Chloe! I don't have time for mirrors!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have one word for 'Mirrors': yllis.From the annoying "hey, this movie's about mirrors, people!" opening credits to Kiefer Sutherland's revival of his "Jack Bauer" character from '24,' 'Mirrors' was about as bad as it could be in such a so-called suspenseful genre.Honestly, I can't even remember the explanation they gave to the spirits behind the numerous mirrors, but I remember getting the feeling we're watching another chapter in 'A Nightmare on Elm Street.' Here we have some supernatural being that kills at will that baffles anyone in the real world, frightens those who do believe and must be stopped by some reluctant nun. That and a million other clichés, including separated parents with the male (always the male-half) trying to clean up so he can see his children, a night-watchman in a creepy haunted house and a cast of characters who don't believe the potential psycho/demon until, well, the plot asks them to, ruined what could have been a better movie.Synopsis: Soon-to-be reinstated cop gets a job at a recently partially burned down NYC department store only to fall prey to something behind the mirrors. This entity apparently follows him and his loved ones anywhere/everywhere for some weird reason. Yes, I actually jumped 2 times in the movie ? I admit I wanted to be scared, or at least, entertained. I let myself go, but couldn't help but laugh out loud at the "shocks" and "twists" towards the end that, I guess, was supposed to be the "mystery."Though Sutherland says "Damnit!" in the movie, he might as well has said, "Damnit, Chloe! We don't have time for this!" like his signature line in '24.' There was absolutely no change to his character from the show. Despite me loving '24' and his Bauer character, I would've appreciated to see some range, as he had in 'A Few Good Men' or 'A Time to Kill.' He has the talent; this was just him being lazy, as was the script. Skip. It was as predictable as an episode of 'Gilligan's Island.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the start, I had high hopes that this would be a cut above other horror movies currently out. That didn't turn out to happen. After about ten minutes the movie got really slow and unnecessarily complicated. Keifer Sutherland is okay as the protagonist, but other than that, most of the players really suck.There are a few decent visual tricks with the mirrors, but they can't make up for the stupidity of the story. At the end, when the nun is left in the room of mirrors and her face explodes I thought that would over, but instead it just keeps going and she becomes some kind of stupid CGI demon. It becomes totally ridiculous and unwatchable at that point. The ending was also lame. It's too bad because this movie could have been so much more, instead of something so dumb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very testing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has a lot going for it: A clever logo, some interesting faces and accents, an enthousiastic CGI department - by the look of it probably working for sandwiches and affection - and a composer who is man enough to steal the entire score. Unfortunately though, what little expectations I had before watching were rendered flaccid by the first line on the DVD box: "Blablabla, director of The Hills Have Eyes, blablabla".Always one to judge at hardly a glimpse, I instantly connected all the referenced film's earlier associations to this film. The Hills Have Eyes was another clever title which managed to undo any and all positive expectations within the first ten minutes - Only to go on for another hour-and--a-half or so. I really don't know, I used it for weeks to fall asleep to. Infallibly knocked me unconscious in minutes.Mirrors is a piece of work, I'll give Mr. Aja that much. It wasn't until I spotted a flat screen monitor halfway through that I was certain this movie wasn't from the early nineties. It takes courage to coherently do things in a tragically outdated manner when you're supposed to be a fresh young filmmaker.Movie scorers should be prohibited from dramatically using the diminished fifth interval in horror or suspense. The same goes for building up a diminished seventh chord in order to create a climactic scene ending: the effect has been no more than comical ever since the late eighties.The score was annoyingly present during the entire thing. Annoyingly present and completely stolen. Surprisingly, though, stolen from other sources than I had imagined. What I thought I recognised as the two main themes were one blatant adaptation of Sting's Russians and a inane repetition of one or two bars from Bach's Toccata&amp; Fuga. Admittedly, they were some of the coolest bars in there. Turns out, though, that the score was adapted from an existing classical piece. (thank you Wikipedia) No sense getting into plot review. 'Very testing' would be an accurate general description. If you've always wondered what it would be like if Stephen King and Michael Bay had a backward, moronic love child, but would refuse to support its special needs with astronomical budgets: Skip through this flick some time. Otherwise, save yourself the trouble.Jason Flemyng ("It's a deal, it's a steal, it's the sale of the f**kin' century") has a Gary Oldman-like role. That is meant as a compliment. Kudos to you, sir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing; some memorable scenes at least</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.Mirrors was overall a pretty satisfying film. It entertains, manages to give some very tasteful death scenes, which one death goes back to what I said in the summary, and the plot isn't necessarily bad. Well, the problem with Mirrors is it's a film where when you're watching it you just can't help but think they are trying too hard, and even if they weren't, that's what you're going to believe, because a lot of material in this film did seem exaggerated and over-acted. Also, the movie is slightly boring at times, because there isn't any really high scenes of interest except a couple of scenes which give this movie it's edge. One scene is Angie's death scene. The jaw dismemberment death was the best part and the most memorable thing about this movie. Second of all, the final scenes where Ben is fighting the demon are cool, such as, when the demon is first released back into this world through Anna and all the glass breaks, that was another really cool scene. Finally, the scenes where Amy and Michael are trying to fight off Michael's reflection in the water are probably the most interesting parts and I enjoyed them too. Basically with Mirrors, if you can hang in for the first half of the movie, the next half is the real ride, so while it has great build up, it's just not a masterpiece. In the end, it was an enjoyable and fun movie that really shouldn't be watched for nothing more than entertainment, because that's all it is with some very likable scenes, but lacks a little in basically everything else. If you were expecting an Oscar-worthy masterpiece from the beginning, no wonder you hated it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mirrors" - a movie about possessed - you guessed it - mirrors. Well... haven't we seen that movie before? That's right, it was called "Poltergeist III" and it sucked. Well, yeah, the concept may be old but hey! You can never get enough of the old creepy-things-suddenly-appear-in-the-mirror cliché. And it never gets old watching the camera swerve from the mirror image to reality back to the mirror to reveal: Jesus! The images differ! There's something going on!!Alright, let's get it out of the way: the premise isn't the only thing that sucks. Kiefer Sutherland's performance is unintentionally funny at times (did anybody else notice that this guy is always sniffing as if he had a cold in every goddamn role he plays? He seems to think that's got something to do with acting, I guess), and seeing director Aja move on to a mediocre movie like this is just sad.A burned down department building should have made for a nice horror film setting, but Aja somehow didn't know how to make this place atmospheric and spooky. From the outside the place looks like a mate painting that a low budget movie from the 80's would have used. The CGI in general is bad. In one particularly bad scene someone catches fire and it looks as if the effect had been made with iMovie. Even in the infamous Jaw-ripping scene the usage of CGI is obvious. That's just unnecessary (although the scene is still pretty cool).The story doesn't make sense at times. We're never sure what the mirrors can and can't do. It's as if the movie makers hadn't understood the concept themselves. In the end the mirrors' powers are seemingly unlimited. People can reach out of them, be sucked into them... rendering the previous "suspense" illogical. Another thing that's particularly retarded is the fact that in the third act of the movie we find out that the department building was built over a hospital - literally built over it. Like the cellar of the hospital is still intact with the electricity working.Dammit, I may be a horror fan, but I'm not completely braindead. However, I'm not very demanding, so after having stated all these flaws, I still have to say that I was mildly entertained by "Mirrors". At least it had nothing to do with vampires, zombies, werewolves, slashers or Japanese ghosts. How many other horror movies can claim the same these days? So no, "Mirrors" isn't recommendable, but it's not a complete waste of time, either. Still, I'm not putting so much faith into Mr. Aja's future anymore. This movie probably means 7 years of bad luck for his career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I'd like to tell you that the last couple of months I've been banging these types of movies in to my head, and I guess I'm a bit numb to them now.To be honest I had hesitated to watch this movie after reading the plot here on IMDb and it seemed so different from the original, Japanese/Korean(?), movie. But I got ill and had nothing to do so I saw this movie alone, around 2 am. My first impression was that it jumps right in to the storyline directly and things starts to happen rather quickly.The ambiance of the movie was dark, yet artistic and fairly well done. I saw the original movie a couple of months back, and what I miss in the new one is More info on the background of the head character and also more info on everything. It felt like they've put too much effort in making as many and as 'scary' jump-scenes as possible so the forgot/left out the important story.The jump-scenes was OK, but, at least, in the beginning I think they kind of overdid it. And what is up with the monsterthingy in the ending? Sorry, that ruined a lot of the film for me. They should've just stopped with the exploding nun.Overall I think it was a pretty good movie, well shot and an OK manuscript, but the original is better, at least plot wise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You can't hide from reflection - or the later part of this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film I was really looking forward to seeing. When it was released in theatres I tried to persuade people to go see it but no one was keen other than me. From the trailer it looked intriguing, being stalked by your own reflection sounded like a new direction of psychological horror and Kiefer Sutherland is usually pretty good, but I have to say after finally seeing it I can't decide if I am disappointed or not.Ben (Sutherland) is a former cop who is pending investigation after accidentally killing someone, after this he plunged into the world of drink but now he is three months clean and trying to patch things up with his wife and kids. Fed up of living on his sister's (Smart) sofa he takes on a job as a night watchman at a burnt down shopping mall. The job is easy money, sit and watch television and every three hours wander round the building to scare away any intruders. The problem he finds though on his first night is that he himself is the intruder. As he looks into the mirrors he starts to see reflections of things that aren't taking place, many of them being of the people who savagely died in the fire. Things become weirder when Ben leaves the building to find he is still being stalked by his reflection and that no one will believe his story. His family begins to become stalked by their reflections also and when he finds out the previous night watchmen had the same problem, ending with them killing themselves; he attempts to find out what the mirrors want. The reply is: Esseker, and from here on in Ben searches for the answers.The first half of this film is intriguing; the thought of being stalked by your reflection really plays on your mind. Of course we are all stalked by our reflections but here you will move one way and your reflection will move another. The sure fear of trying to hide from something that is unavoidable is scary on its own and when your reflection causes you to do things you don't want to do you can really feel petrified that your reflection is everywhere. The first half puts you on edge and begins to journey down the route of psychological thriller until?.. Well until the second half.In the second half Ben attempts to search for the reasons, which makes the premise of the first half lose its thrill. Now we begin to unravel the true meaning behind the mirrors demonic ways and without telling you what it is I will say it is so un-scary. The film plays out like many other horror film of today with someone being stalked or haunted and then venture out to find out why. When the second half of Mirrors kicks in here we realise that it is only happening again. The whole thing just becomes a tired old cliché, which is a shame considering the good premise. The dialogue becomes typical, the washed up former cop character is typical and even an oddball family met later in the film is stereotypical. I really wanted this to go more down the psychological route rather than the horror cliché one.The acting is hit and miss. Sutherland is OK as the former cop, sometimes putting on a show and others realising he is in a corny horror. Patton is poor as Ben's disbelieving wife, disbelieving of course until the mirrors stalk her. Smart gets very little screen time but is involved in the most horrific scene. I say horrific but also looks the least realistic compared to some of the images in the mirrors and Jason Flemyng is just useless as the bit part cop that seems to be unneeded.It's disappointing that I feel this way about the film as I really enjoyed the opening half and really thought this was going to go down a dark road but ultimately it just becomes another typical horror involving mirrors. The film does have its positives so I don't want to write it off completely. It does have its scare and thrills just not in the later half. The first half, although unrealistic, feels believable where the second just spirals out of control. Saying that though the final few moments is a bit of a shock and a good ending for the film. It made me feel a bit more for it in the end. I am disappointed but really enjoyed the first half so am willing to say it is an average film which could have been so much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good value horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kiefer Sutherland is a cop recovering from a breakdown. On medication to soften the effects of alcohol withdrawal, he is separated from his wife and children, and living with his sister. But he is starting to put his life back together by starting a job as security guard in the burnt out wreck of an old department store called the Mayflower. Then he starts seeing things in the mirrors in the Mayflower which cannot possibly be true. Is he having hallucinations? He can't easily tell anyone because they will think he is still having a breakdown. We know the truth, however, having seen the prologue - there is something evil about the mirrors. The rest of the film concerns his escalating battle with the mirrors (or what his in them), and his search for the truth behind them so that he can save his family.The first thing to say is that there is no pussyfooting around - so often horror films concentrate on building and teasing, but Mirrors simply gets on with it, right from the start. Which is not to say that it's one-note - there is more story than I expected, and the ride gives us space to breathe from time to time. But I was completely absorbed throughout the nearly 2 hour screen time.I don't think any horror film can avoid elements of formula, and Mirrors is no exception - there are plenty of moments which are exactly what you expect. These include a number of "jump" moments and predictable plot developments. But Sutherland, and his screen family, are all sympathetic enough to make you care what happens to them, and not everything always unfolds as you might think it would.Paula Patton as Sutherland's wife is an actress new to me. Her character could easily be a cliché but is written well-enough to avoid this, and Miss Patton gives her a strong, attractive and credible screen presence.This is a good, solid, satisfying horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Upon reflection....get it?....Ambitious but sadly misses the mark somewhere along the way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexandre Aja became an immediate blip on my Horror radar with the absolutely brilliant remake of The Hills Have Eyes, one of the most terrifying Horror films of all time. Following that I was impressed by the equally disturbing High Tension (Haute tension) (both of which he wrote.) I expected great things from him. Then there was a little stumble when he wrote the lack luster and typical P2. Now we have Mirrors. As I said I do believe Mirrors is ambitious and the idea is terrific and even has a touch of originality to it dealing with mirrors which, let's face it, can be very disturbing. Unfortunately there were a few mistakes in making this movie. The cast was sub par and you never really get to know them or feel any compassion for them. Also considering how gory past Aja films have been the movie only had two murders and they were disgustingly gory but then left the rest of the film kind of void of any blood soaked gore and instead went for the psychological thrills which is great if it holds together but somehow Mirrors doesn't quite make the grade. It felt like there was so much there that they wanted to tap into and yet somehow they couldn't do it. Perhaps too much of their main ideas and story ended up on the cutting room floor.I have always thought of myself as a pretty big Kiefer Sutherland fan but I realized something as I watched this movie...I'm not. I'm a HUGE Jack Bauer fan (24) but Kiefer Sutherland is kind of a two trick pony. He can do evil villains (mostly from his twenties and the 1980's) and he can play Jack Bauer, which is an amazing character so good for him. As many reviewers point out his character in Mirrors is not much more than a Supernaturally aware Jack Bauer. He just doesn't capture the emotion that is necessary for this role. He was the wrong pick to lead this cast period and I think it's a major reason the movie misses it's mark. Paula Patton is good as Sutherland's wife Amy. Yes she looks like Halle Berry a little, but more girl next door which works well for her. Her and Sutherland are decent together but neither one seem to carry the film. Cameron Boyce and Erica Gluck are decent in the role of Sutherland and Patton's children. In a movie like this I expected a really strong role from the youngsters, something along the lines of Haley Joel Osment or thereabouts but there are really just okay. Amy Smart rounds out the cast in a small role as Sutherland's sister who dies in a horrible and violent way...one of the coolest death scenes I have seen in Horror Movies and I've seen my share. I knew though that chances were Amy Smart would be eye candy to flash some boob and then die.The whole movie just feels like all the pieces are lined up, everything is in place and then someone purposely takes those pieces and jams them in all the wrong way. Now after saying all this the movie takes liberties with a twist in the end. Twists at the end of the movies haven't been shocking or stunning since the days of The Sixth Sense or the under rated The Others but I must say when I realized what had happened at the end of Mirrors, it probably brought the movie up a point or maybe even two points. It was a great ending, twisted, disturbing and completely surprising. You never see it coming although it actually makes complete sense. All in all the movie is sadly average in every way and doesn't come together the way that it should. Check out Aja's earlier entries because this is a stumble. Even Sutherland fans or horror fans won't be blown away by this one. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave myself a hard time with the rating ... I was thinking about giving the movie a third star. If you include the visuals, the art direction, one or two nice special/gory effects, than you might be leaning to that conclusion (or so I was) ... even the ending is pretty good (an ending this movie definitely doesn't deserve). Still the negative things had the upper hand ...That's not to say, you can't have a hoot with this film. It's just not what the director originally intended. The Frightfest crowd in London, was pretty loud during the screening of this movie. They laughed, especially during the last act/third of Mirrors. The dialogue, the notorious plot explaining, the ludicrous plot. Everything summed up, makes for a pretty great comedy. With two or three gory effects thrown in, for good measure. And while this was a saving grace for previous movies Mr. Aja made (especially his first one), this can't be saved, with an effort like this. Which begs the question: Is Aja overrated? I can't give you the answer to that ... but I can warn you, not to watch this movie. Especially if you have some (not even high) standards, on how a horror (or any movie for that matter) should be.Having Kiefer Sutherland playing the lead role didn't help either. Emotionless and almost in competition for a "Steven Seagal acting" honorary award! The fact, that his problems or any character development for that matter are thrown out the window, just conclude the overall bad state of the movie. A horror movie, doesn't have to be complex. Mirrors shows you, that Horror can be the best light-headed comedy there can be ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>French director Alexandre Aja exploded onto the horror scene in 2003 with excellent horror flick Switchblade Romance, but since then he's disappointingly veered off into remake territory. He can be forgiven somewhat for his first remake - an updating of the Wes Craven semi-classic The Hills Have Eyes - because it was quite good, but this next attempt - an Americanisation of South Korean film 'Mirrors', is not so successful. The basis for the plot is actually quite good and with some minor tweaks, Mirrors could have been a successful horror film. The plot focuses on Ben Carson; and ex-cop and ex-alcoholic who has been forced to take a night watchman's job in order to get his life back on track for the good of his children. His new job is at a shopping centre, which was forced to close down after a fire devastated the building. He soon notices that the mirrors in the building are extremely clean - as a result of the previous watchman's obsession with them - and he later finds out why, as there's an evil that lives in the mirrors; and Ben Carson is their next target.The lead role is taken by Kiefer Sutherland. I've been a fan of Kiefer ever since I saw The Lost Boys; but he feels out of place in this film. It's probably just because I'm so used to seeing him as Jack Bauer that it's impossible to believe him doing any other role. The first half of the film is rather poor; the atmosphere of the former shopping centre is good, but most of the runtime is taken up by various CGI special effects going on in the mirrors, and it soon becomes tedious. Luckily, things pick up in the second half. There's a rather nasty murder scene; and then the film starts to develop a plot, which is fairly intriguing. It has to be said that the plot is rather lacking in logic at times, and all sorts of plot holes can be picked out; but then again, it is a film about evil inside mirrors at the end of the day. The revelation regarding how the mirrors became evil is a bit disappointing; I was hoping for something better, but at least the final twist is amusing. Overall, I can't recommend this film really but if it's a rainy day and you've got nothing else to watch, you could do worse than see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>goes for cheap scares instead of psychological suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another over-the-top American horror movie based on an Asian horror movie. Kiefer is alright but the other actors are pretty bad and the dialog is quite poor. Only the first third of "Mirrors" is any good. It's downhill after that as Kiefer tries to unravel the mystery of the mirrors. Instead of genuine creepiness, things jump out at every moment. And then there's the over-the-top finale which is unnecessary and awful.I like the idea of abandoned places as the setting in horror movies. I watched the horror film "Session 9" after this and it was quite a bit better. The director knew what the director of "Mirrors" didn't know. Setting is crucially important in horror movies. "Mirrors" used the abandoned department store in its first third and then abandoned it for more scares outside. The film should have taken advantage of this setting and used it more. The film does backtrack to the abandoned store at the end of the film, but by then all mystery and suspense is gone from the place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Mirrors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking at the filmography of Alexandre Aja, he's becoming dangerously close to being branded as a director who specializes in remakes of films that can allow him to amplify the original gore factor, and one who hopefully doesn't position himself, intentionally or otherwise, such that audiences would come to expect a twist in every single one of his movies.While I'd enjoy his Haute Tension and his version and update of The Hills Have Eyes, he seemed to have reined himself in with Mirrors, where allowance for violent excesses was minimized and allocated to creating mood and tension, which succeeded as the movie went along, and plodded forward during many moments in the beginning when Kiefer Sutherland's Ben Carson began probing the mystery of his workplace. You can just about sense Aja's glee when it came to scenes that called for gore, and at times succumbed to cheap scares which were rather successful.However, Aja can't decide if this was going to be an all out spiritual spook fest, or a monster movie, and that confusion resulted in an actual schizophrenia, where one ending is insufficient, and you'd need two endings in order to provide for some bang for the buck. It's as if it ran on multiple fronts which could be delinked from one another, and if not for the characters' relationships, it could well be a series of shorts pasted together with the mirrors being running motifs where spirits reside in, and can determine life or death, with a concept quite refreshing, but again, unoriginal since it's a Hollywood adaptation.While Aja might seem to want to tread back to familiar territory at every opportunity at gore, Keifer Sutherland too can't seem to break too far away from his cop related roles for the big screen, save for lending his voice in Phone Booth, his recent The Sentinel and this one still had his character come from the force. Perhaps it's lazy casting on the filmmakers' part in getting someone already familiar with the territory so that audiences can immediate latch onto his Jack Bauer persona, and have it plain sailing from there. And no matter how Sutherland tries to provide a new dimension to his mentally pained ex-cop, he just can't shake Bauer off, which became as niggling as the persistent spirits that call out for his attention.And that familiarity didn't just stop with the director and the lead actor, as it extended toward the supporting appearance by Amy Smart, though in a not so surprising role of being here just to shed her clothes. I thought she could be a decent actress without having to resort to such "tricks", but I guess filmmakers from Crank to Mirrors still haven't got enough of her Road Trip stint. Again, very dangerous ground to tread on for the mentioned - one for gory remakes, one for cop roles, and one a naked flowervase.Granted there were some fine moments courtesy of special effects, with misbehaving mirror images and the way characters get dispatched - slow, painful and plenty of blood - but those looking for occasionally fine scary moments may find them in Mirrors. I've not seen the original 2003 Korean movie Into the Mirror which this movie is based upon, but given the cheeky finale, I just might be interested to check out the Korean version. For now, I'd start to think about those palm prints left behind in mirrors as they will never look the same again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>some genuinely creepy moments, but a dumb plot and twists can't suffice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexandre Aja probably has talent - I say probably as it's only sprung out his films in pieces. While I've yet to see High Tension, his Hills Have Eyes Remake bares something of a resemblance to Mirrors even as they're fairly different in horror subject matter (one a remake of a near classic Grindhouse flick and the other a remake of a kinda popular Japanese ghost-story flick), so I can try and gage what he has to offer in the genre. And what is it? Basically, that he can conjure up a few chilling and/or creepy moments without really digging into something really exciting or unconventional, and not doing much to either really revitalizing the update of the former film or make it seem any less silly or dumb. With Mirrors it's actually a bit of a slog when Aja actually tries to relay plot or character (i.e. main character ex-Cop, former drunk, pulling life together, ex-wife and kids, blah blah) and we beg deep down for him to get to the gory and (hopefully) scary parts.As it happens, at the least, Mirrors does engage us enough to try to buy what at first appears as a ghost story: killers, or a killer, in mirrors attack those who are around them or are close to those near Kiefer Sutherland's character. Aja manages to get a good atmosphere going with the dilapidated building he's guarding (albeit a little ridiculous to think it's stood that long without being torn down for new real estate in Manhattan of all places), and there is one killing scene- the one instance that starts as cliché (girl in bathtub) and becomes something frightening and just crazy- that works well. But he also rides out a so-so mystery/investigation by Sutherland's character into a mysterious little girl who possibly did something following the burning down of a hospital/store to get to his horror sequences, and by the time we're in the third act it just becomes too implausible to really give a damn (it's too plot-hole-like to have a schizophrenic mirror-killer scheme when technically they could kill any time they want, not just when someone looks at the mirror for longer than a second).The somber tone also doesn't help things to appear as more than just a tad sillier than need be; Sutherland's over-acting doesn't help much to this effect, and a Halle Berry look-alike (though not a bad one) in Paula Patton is mostly relegated to looking anxious and upset and frantic in 'must-save-one-psycho-kid-and-one-defenseless-kid' mode. For those looking for just pure gore it's not too shabby perhaps, if nowhere near as much as 'Hills', even as aja has perhaps shown a little more skill and patience as a filmmaker. Mirrors is somewhat of a tough call: it's not a good movie, but it's also not a bad one entirely either. Somewhere in the middle it rests, occasionally surprising but mostly complacent as another knock-off of the countless Japanese horror stories that invariably involve shapes in objects (earlier this year we had One Missed Call in cell phones, next week it will be in suppositories) and spooky children seeking revenge in one form or another.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top-class terror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A characteristic of truly great horror fiction is it's ability to believably transform some aspect of our world from a reassuring pillar of certainty into a doorway to hell. In the case of "Mirrors", this process is applied to the fact that reflections in glass can simply never have a life of their own. The plot centers on an ex-cop named Ben Carson (Keifer Sutherland) who takes a job as a night watchman at a burned-out department store. This apparently easy gig turns into a nightmare after he attracts the attention of an evil presence that dwells in the mirrors that somehow survived the fire. To make matters worse, his family are also targeted by this entity -which can exert it's influence through any reflecting surface- and Carson is running out of time to save them.At this point in his career, it is obvious that Alexandre Aja is destined to be one of the great horror directors. This film confirms his skill at building unbearable levels of fear and tension (which was so apparent in his remake of "The Hills Have Eyes") and then relentlessly shocking the audience. The pace is relentless and the atmosphere of terror only escalates as the film reaches it's climax. This is one of the few horror films ever made that is truly and deeply frightening. An undisputed classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've watched enough films now to know how a film will pan out. The beginning is somewhat boring. However, halfway through the film I was surprisingly gripped it's like what happened in the start is irrelevant and almost acceptable because I was so gripped... Then I started to think the film was actually good and I'd been too harsh.But then towards the end of the film it does go somewhat downhill. I can't work out if it was a good film or not. I think it introduces irrelevant plots at the start and focuses on them too much. But that's not the real issue...I think the film drags a little bit? It's missing something which is preventing me from rating it higher than a 6! I just don't know what. The ending is actually quite good... But it's more what happened before the actual ending that is a let down.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this film. I'd say it's okay but not something I'd recommend. It's better than other films I've seen because you are gripped in the middle of the film... But it's not an amazing film.I think the acting could have been better... Because the plot isn't too bad apart from how the ending came about, I just don't feel like the characters were really 'into' their roles.I've watched this film and I'd rate it a 6. If nothing else is on then watch this film. I wouldn't recommend renting this film or choosing it over another one... It's not that good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mirrors (2008): Dir: Alexandre Aja / Cast: Kiefer Sutherland, Paula Patton, Amy Smart, Mary Beth Peil, Cameron Boyce: Stupid morbid horror film about image and illusion. This film has a self praised illusion while its image is pure sh*t. Kiefer Sutherland plays an ex investigator who accepts a job at an abandon mall that has burned. Soon he begins to see images of burn victims including his own reflection. Director Alexandre Aja can set up scare sequences but the graphic violence should be toned down in favour of suspense. Sutherland pulls through as he struggles to deal with reality and the unknown and coming off crazy. Supporting roles aren't quite as broad. Paula Patton is featured as his wife in a role that is strictly standard and predictable. Amy Smart is wasted as his sister whose mirror image tears her jaw apart thus killing herself. All she needed was a trip to the dentist for that kind of action and she can make return trips. Mary Beth Peil appears as an aged institutionalized woman. After being part of this film she may need to go back. Cameron Boyce plays their son, and having a kid to mind screw is typical with these films. Horror films in the past ten years seem to be all about gore and guts and it is beginning to take the place of true suspense. Grossing viewers out isn't suspense, it's just disgusting. Well made visually with a screenplay that shatters before the second act. Score: 4 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been a while since I watched this movie. It was like two years ago when I watched it, and I watched it on a classmate's laptop on a school trip. I'll tell you, though, I saw pretty much everything, except I closed my eyes on the jaw scene. I'll tell you, that is extremely, extremely graphic. Taking it away would probably give a 14A in some parts of Canada and lower ratings in other places, such as a possible PG-12 in Japan.Anyway, I don't remember so well, but this was actually quite frightening.

		<shortDescription>Genuinely creepy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't usually comment on films that already have this many reviews, but I saw Mirrors three or four years ago, and it stayed with me. I realise I'm in the minority, but I really liked it, so I got the DVD to make sure, and I still really like it.The first hour accurately replicates the terror and confusion of the onset of mental illness, both from a sufferer's point of view and that of someone witnessing changes in a person they know. There's a palpable atmosphere throughout the runtime, helped by an energetic score, the performances, especially Sutherland's, who's very good, and some stylised lighting, particularly during the burnt-out shopping precinct scenes.While the effects are generally impressive, this stylisation helps soften some of the less convincing CG. The precinct set (or location, possibly) looks great - I hesitate to say it but it's reminiscent of games such as Devil May Cry, and looking like a video game generally isn't a good thing for a film, but it does work. The scenes outside this setting are lit more realistically, but the difference isn't jarring.As the second half gets going it naturally becomes unequivocably supernatural, which is often a turnoff for me, but by that point I was invested. It kinda becomes a mystery for 20 or 30 minutes, as Sutherland's character tries to figure out what's going on, then returns to its original unsettling mood. The tension never lets up for long, and the ending is satisfying.Definitely watch it with the lights off. Preferably surrounded by mirrors. And if you need a bit of light relief afterwards, there's an extra on the DVD with a goth talking nonsense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The good parts conquer the bad parts. Definitely recommended.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Besides being a devout Horror fan, two reasons made me try this film: First, my love for Horror films featuring well known top rated cast members (in this case Kiefer Sutherland). As a terribly underrated genre, every known television or cinema star who plays in Horror adds to its coverage and prestige. Second, even if I wasn't a fan of the Haunting and Ghost Story sub-genre, I've always liked Horror stories concerning and involving mirrors. I've never had a real fear of mirrors myself, but this specific theme has tons of potential in the Horror genre!Mirrors allegedly delivers all of the above. The acting is pretty much great (not just Sutherland, every member of the cast did a good job). At times I didn't like Paula Patton's overacting (though it was obviously a direct order from the filmmakers), and I did think there was room to give Cameron Boyce and Erica Gluck more screen time (mainly because I'm a huge fan of young actors and actresses taking their first steps in Horror), but bad acting was definitely not one of this film's problems. The story didn't feel too original but quite generic. Something evil lives in the mirror, we should drive it away before it kills us. What did seem original (I haven't seen it in other films yet) was the way the evil in the mirror kills its victims, using their reflections against them. I've watched the unrated version, which turned out to be a mistake, as I'm not a fan of gore, blood and the "look how much money I've spent on effects" syndrome. Gore fans would prefer that version, though.The ending lacks the coveted plot twist which makes a good Horror film great, and yet was original and well executed. Many films of this genre suffer from its curse - endings which are anticlimactic and sometimes down right disappointing. While a well thought of plot twist is an excellent tool to deter that effect, Mirrors shows us that not all fine endings involve twists.All in all, I've really enjoyed watching this film. While some parts of the story weren't as good as others, the overall experience is entertaining and at times actually frightening. Definitely recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understand that many people want to see more psychological horror as many horror films in recent years use jump scared which I've seen referred to as "not real horror". Mirror brings just what you are looking for.Aja builds suspense brilliantly so there is the occasional slight jump. Otherwise, it is a cleverly shot film showing our fears.Have you ever wondered what your reflection does when you aren't looking? Kiefer Sutherland plays a suspended cop who is working as a security guard at an abandoned department store filled with mirrors. However, in the mirrors are not just his reflection...I will not spoil what happens or how it ends. If you were to watch the opening scene you would get a feel for what the film is like. With strong violence (as per usual for Alexandre Aja), Mirrors will satisfy all groups of horror fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not the best of Alexander Aja but still worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched the full uncut version to be sure to have all the gore included because I know the director Alexandre Aja very well for his ultra gore flicks Haute Tension (2003) and The Hills Have Eyes (2006). This one here isn't a bad film but for an Aja flick it's rather low on gore.Luckily it still has a good story to offer and the performances were above mediocre. I watched the screen with suspense even as you can see it coming sometimes from miles away. As I stated earlier, the gore isn't the main thing in this flick, it's all about the mirrors and the CGI attached to it. Even as I am not a CGI lover here it does work out fine mostly. But when the gore comes in it's in full glory. The opening is worth watching and the bath scene with the nude Amy Smart (Angela Carson) does offer something for the geeks out there too.Still it isn't the best of Alexander Aja. After Mirrors we had to wait until Piranha 3D (2010) to see gratuitous gore again. But Mirrors is worth picking up if you are into ghost stories.Gore 1,5/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 3,5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mirrors of death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say, I was really impressed with the story behind this one. Mirrors is quite a dark, it's twist at the end, one hell of a payoff. Mirrors have never been scarier. Sutherland does well as a troubled guy, who gets a security night job, at the old classic building, where of course the last guard, disappeared. In this building are possessed mirrors, that end up controlling your mind, and taking away your sanity, while of course, causing death too. Though in it's story, it does get bogged down with too many preposterous story angles, but it does have you believing or more so, wanting to believe the the story, to be reality. It was great to see Kiefer in this, and he has fine support, although there are some ugly moments-violent wise, one with his daughter that goes too far, where the violence does challenge you, the start a bloody scarily thrilling opening. On the whole Mirrors, a solid supernatural drama does warrant your attention. Something fresh and original, and they had to make a sequel, didn't they.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In this mirror world, we don't need no rules! Unless we do.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mirrors" is an attempt at an American remake of a Korean horror film and it just doesn't translate. Even if you're not familiar with the original story, there are constant inconsistencies present and a climax that shatters the film like a tea cup thrown out onto the pavement. The premise is that an ex-police officer (Kiefer Sutherland as Ben) that is down on his luck is hired as a night guard at an abandoned shopping center. There he begins seeing strange images inside the mirrors of the building. They turn out to be far more than just hallucinations; they're deadly. If he wants these horrifying images to stop and his family to be safe he will have to solve a good ol' fashioned horror-ghost mystery.If you're a fan of what I call "J-Horror" films, you will see an overall story that's pretty familiar. You expect the movie to set up some terrifying visions, a quest for the hero, a couple of deaths here and there and a terrifying mystery in the end. The trick will be to get to the bottom of the catastrophe while avoiding any mirror surfaces, which are conduits for the ghostly forces. Trouble begins when The rules set up early in the movie keep getting broken. The further you get in, the more it becomes both confusing and frustrating. For example, the main way that mirrors kill people in the film is by having the reflections act on their own and force people to commit suicide (it's odd, but that's the general idea). Towards the climax of the film this changes completely. Sometimes reflections attack other people or appear without the person who created them being in the room. The reflections feel more like evil ghost duplicates than actual evil versions of themselves that are trapped in reflective surfaces. There are even some scenes where people are being attacked without any reflection present, so in the end you just give up trying to understand what's going on with the movie. Another inconsistency is in the sounds. Most of the time, the mirrors don't make any noise. That makes sense because they're just images reflected that gain the supernatural ability to influence people instead of the other way around. Once again towards the end of the film you hear some reflections making noises and talking and it doesn't make any sense. In theory it would work because just when you think your character is safe, suddenly he or she will be in mortal peril, but in practice it just feels like the script was quickly written with additional scares thrown in without anyone taking a second look at them to see if they worked with the film's pre-established rules.Another big flaw in the film is that it isn't very frightening. You'll be jumping out of your seat plenty, but that's because the movie uses cheap tactics to startle you. If it isn't a quick flash of a grotesque mutilated body accompanied by a music sting, it's a sudden flapping of bird wings or a door slamming. The movie has some genuinely creepy looking sets and some unsettling scenes but instead of building suspense and letting the chills slowly come to you as you start playing with possible scenarios in your head, it just interrupts itself with these cheap sound cues and loud noises. It's a shame because the movie actually starts off pretty creepy. You have this really big derelict shopping center that was the setting for a big tragedy and our main character is stuck there for hours by himself in the dark. There are creepy burnt manikins, perfect for setting up an unsuspecting sneak onto Ben... but it just drops that entirely by making the bulk of the film set in a series of different location. It doesn't help that the characters in the movie make the same mistakes as every other character that sees ghosts and is forced to solve a supernatural mystery. Ben acts erratically, breaking mirrors and painting over them without giving any explanations to the people around him and he doesn't ever try to collect evidence that there are weird things going on. He never tries to convince the people he is trying to protect that he isn't crazy, just so we can have the scene where he gets into a fight with the people that don't believe him.Then, we get to that ending. This is A MINOR SPOILER, but we're basically told that long ago the problem of the ghosts/mirrors/demonic creatures was tackled by exorcists and priests and that they had no success in taming this threat. This information is not only inconsistent with the end of the movie, but it makes the behaviour of the characters in the film totally unexplainable. The ridiculous reason for the mirrors being dangerous is nothing compared to the climax of the film, which is taken from a totally different genre and is downright silly. It would be wrong to spoil exactly what happens in the scenes right before the very end of the movie but if you see this confrontation you'll be shaking your head in embarrassment.The movie isn't a complete disaster but there are points where you can totally tell that the original story just wouldn't translate into a North American setting and nobody knew what to do. Solution? Pick something at random from another horror movie and fill in the gaps. It ends up playing like a terrible Asian ghost movie and a terrible American haunted house story mashed together and coarsely stitched so it would stay in place just long enough for the film to conclude. If the concept of "Mirrors" sounds interesting to you, track down the original source material, or just grab a good Asian horror film. Don't bother sitting through this 111 minute train wreck because you'll be really frustrated as everything that looked promising at first falls flat on its face. (Dvd, April 11, 2013)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My reflections on Mirrors?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Alexandre Aja's Mirrors boasts a decent cast and stunning gore courtesy of FX experts Howard Berger and Greg Nicotero, but misses being a completely satisfying horror experience by failing to adhere to a convincing or consistent internal logic.At first, the mirrors are the gateway by which the evil force finds its way into our world; later, it can use any reflective surface?which is just as dumb as it sounds (almost any smooth surface has a reflection; it would be impossible to avoid them all!). The evil attacks the night-watchmen working at the department store, but doesn't bother with the old guard who patrols the building during the day. Most ridiculous is Ben Carson's continuing to work at the store, even after experiencing several supernatural incidents that would send most people screaming, never to return. These kind of problems plague the film to the end, seriously undermining its effectiveness.Still, at least the film doesn't wimp out on the gore, opening with a splattery throat slashing, giving us a yucky autopsy scene, and delivering a thoroughly shocking sequence in which Amy Smart suffers a grisly bathtub demise, her jaw ripped clean off her face (the same scene also provides the obligatory female nudity, Smart kindly baring boobs and butt before getting in the bath). Aja also sees fit to include that other popular mainstay of the genre: a fit bird in a tight white vest, Paula Patton as Carson's wife doing the honours, even going so far as to get all wet for the film's finale.5.5 out of 10, but I refuse to round it up to a 6 on account of that awful special effects scene in which Sutherland writhes unconvincingly in pain on the floor as he is burned by truly terrible CGI fire.</fullReview>

Slasher movies aren't necessarily my favorites, and I don't like how it quickly turned into an investigation movie and a boring one at that. Investigation in horror can be done right if it's coherent and interesting, which this one was not. The Ring is a great example of an investigation horror film. When it turned into supernatural, that was more of what I was expecting from this film, but it still wasn't terribly entertaining or even scary in the slightest. I think this went more for the "cool effects" route. Speaking of which, the mirror effects did look great, and it was probably the best part of the movie... but if the special effects are the high point of a film, I don't think you're gonna get any quality entertainment.C</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie opens with night security guard Gary Lewis. His reflection in the mirror stabs himself and he dies in the real world with a wide open gash. Ben Carson (Kiefer Sutherland) resigned from the NYPD a year ago after a deadly shooting and he's now sleeping on his sister Angie (Amy Smart)'s couch. He's estranged from his wife Amy (Paula Patton) with whom he has two children. He has stopped drinking recently and trying to rebuild his life. He starts a new job as the night security guard at the burnt-out NYC Mayflower department store. He sees visions in the mirrors and they seem to be looking back at him.I really like the look of the empty department store and the mirror room. The mirror idea is pretty cool. The CGI fire is not the best. There is also a missing element in this horror. Usually there is a question of whether this is all real or not in these kinds of movies. The fact that the first security guard as well as his son see the visions eliminates that possibility right from the start. Another problem is that this needs a physical embodiment of the evil that is both scary and can be put on a poster. It seems to be the perfect fit for an iconic supernatural killer in the mirror like Samara in 'The Ring'. That is missing here. As for the story, this movie needed to end earlier. The movie just goes on and on with Sutherland missing in action for large chunks of it. The movie overstays its welcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bauer gets reflective.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Carson is an ex-police detective in New York whose alcoholism made him incompetent on the job, and caused him to kill a man. Now he's trying to win back the trust of his estranged wife, a medical examiner, and maintain a loving relationship with his two young children. To make money while waiting for reinstatement, he takes a job as a night watchman at a department store gutted by fire. But he is soon tormented by supernatural mirrors that plagued the person he replaced. Ben finds that the mirrors' demons follow him everywhere in every reflective surface.....The biggest problem with the film is that because of the success of 24, you can never see a film with Sutherland in now, without thinking of Jack Bauer, so here, it's just Jack Bauer in a horror film, a good horror film, but he even brings Bauers' traits to the table.But Aja again proves that he is a competent film maker, and until he sold himself out with Pirhanna, he was an exciting horror film maker.The concept of mirrors and your reflection causing you harm is a wonderful idea, and the narrative creates a sinister air of tension.The ending is a little off the straight and narrow, and for gore hounds there is a literal mouth opening moment, but all in all, its a nice horror movie, not trying to exploit, just to scare.And it kind of succeeds....l</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mirrors is a horror movie that was released in 2008, directed by Alexandre Aja. The movie is about Ben (Kiefer Sutherland), A suspended police detective lands himself a job as a night security guard at a shut down department store that previously suffered a massive fire, but the department store has more to it than he knows, something much darker than he could ever think of. Whilst trying to prove himself to his wife after previous problems with alcohol, the strain from the constant strange goings on with the mirrors continues to set even more obstacles in his way of becoming a better father and a better husband. With his past experience with alcohol problems, Ben has to do everything he can to prove to his wife that he is not crazy and that something is not right with the mirrors. Mirrors is rather creepy and somewhat disturbing as the characters own mirror reflection is what causes the character to murder themselves. As much as they try to resist and prevent it they are unable to prevent their reflection causing the killing to proceed.The movies graphics has a massive attention to detail, especially with the death scenes being brutally graphic. For example, the ripping open of the mouth that Ben's sisters mirror image causes her to do is so graphic it may be disturbing to some viewers. I believe that in a horror movie, putting a great amount of attention into the detail of how graphic the gory scenes are is essential. So it definitely can scare some people and that is what you need from a horror movie.Kiefer Sutherland (Jack Bauer, 24), is the perfect lead role making you feel for his character. With Ben going through so much in his past and throughout the movie, you start to feel sorry for Ben leaving you eagerly rooting for him wanting the others to believe him. Overall, this contains everything a horror movie should have, blood, gore and brutalness with a hooking storyline. It didn't get much of a positive response from critics and might not be the best movie in this genre but in it's own right is an acceptable fast, paced horror.Storyline - 4/5Uniqueness - 4? / 5 Overall - 6/10 (1= Weakest - 5=Strongest) (1=Weakest - 10=Strongest)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary And Confusing At The Same Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love a good ghost or haunted house movie, and that is basically what "Mirrors" is all about; Kiefer Sutherland plays a former cop who takes a job as a security guard at a haunted department store, but since every decent haunted house movie needs a plot device, this one focuses on mirrors and reflections, and doesn't let it go. It starts very atmospheric and spooky, and then it accelerates into a far-fetched mind bender with a lot of exposition. Maybe a bit too fast? I've seen a lot of horror movies, both good and bad, and it seems the leap of logic Kiefer makes in the movie from "This place is haunted." to "It's something about the mirrors." was kind of a huge step for his character. Rational people do experience paranormal activity without blaming it on random objects. It's kind of like Jack Nicholson in the middle of "The Shining" blaming the chimney or Geoffrey Rush in the middle of "House On Haunted Hill" suddenly blaming a moose head on a wall. I also think it was a bit of a huge coincidence that Kiefer's character just happens to also be formerly married to the city coroner in order to get the access he needs to do his investigation on the burned out store, and even then, I also don't see why he tries connecting the location to one man's grisly death scene. I mean, I don't get why Kiefer thinks seeing the man's body or cause of death will give him details on the haunting except to set him up for another mirror reflection illusion. He could have got everything he needed to know in one phone call. Why not just do a straight haunted house movie? There is just so much potential in a haunted and abandoned department store that anything else would be exposition. Another thing I didn't care for is that the movie is the unnecessary gore. It kind of stands out in the movie. Amy Smart plays Kiefer's sister and rips her jaw off in the bathtub (why do hot actresses always meet their end in the bathroom?), and the cops don't blink twice. Do you know how strong someone would have to be to do that, and yet, Kiefer's character immediately becomes suspect? They don't bother speculating about a ten-foot guy on steroids? Bottom line, simplified haunted house movies usually work better, but the trickery and reflection motifs in the movie done with mirrors and illusion is very impressive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In other words, about half of the movie is a fabulous thriller when strange and evil things happen, bringing along police investigation... But when viewers get the hint who and what are the reasons, then it comes just visually challenging to monitor the following events and measures taken. The ending has a twist, however, and the overall impression gets a bit better.The other value are two actors: Kiefer Sutherland as Ben Carson and Paula Patton as Amy Carson; the rest are rather ordinary.Thus, it is probably worth watching if you are fan of horror movies with abstract villain as well as use of must-have elements like fire, water and cracks. In general, I am not; the last time I remember I really enjoyed a similar horror movie was The Others from 2001...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Learn to do your hair without a mirror before you watch this...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are basically two ways to Judge a horror movie. The first is to look purely at the quality of the production, things like acting, lighting and writing etc. The second is to simply ask yourself 'did it scare me?' Mirrors is one of those few movies that scores high on both accounts, not only is it well put together as a movie, it's also going to raise the hairs on the back of your neck and have you clutching your armrest. Simply put, Mirrors is a demon/ghost story where the evil spirit makes use of mirrors to interact with humans. Thru the mirrors this unholy reflection causes all kinds of nastiness, including one very gory, yet refreshingly original, death in a bathtub. However, the film has enough of a murder mystery element to keep you guessing at the real nature of the threat until the very end, so don't think this is just another typical ghost story. Director and writer Alexandre Aja has put some real effort into making a film that captivates audiences, not only with high quality special effects and unexpected scare moments but also, and perhaps more impressively, with an engaging storyline and likable characters. Which brings me to the acting. Having always been very indifferent to Kiefer Sutherland I was surprised to find myself really rooting for the guy as he tries desperately to save his family and not lose what little sanity he has left in the process. His estranged wife is caught between trying to help her beloved husband get a grip on reality and protecting her children from daddy who has been unstable at best and has now taken to painting, punching and shooting mirrors. The acting on everyone's part is convincing, including young Cameron Boyce who can go from cute and adorable six-year old to evil demon spawn in seconds. All in all Mirrors is good for several good scares and has a better storyline than you might expect from a horror movie. I recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clunky horror remake can't be saved by a decent ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recovering alcoholic and former cop Kiefer Sutherland is in full Jack Bauer mode as he investigates spooky goings-on at his new workplace. He's got the nightwatchman gig at a burned-out department store. "The mirrors. They're so clean" exclaims Kiefer, who clearly has an eye for good decor? This ill-judged remake of 2003 Korean chiller Into The Mirror takes an interesting premise and renders it almost unwatchable with clunky dialogue, sub-par acting and dubious characters. The pace of the piece is off, too. The spooks pop up too soon, but then the climax is far, far too long coming. With no calm before the storm, there's no chance to get to know the characters and so no reason to care about them. At 110 minutes, more could have been done here, but instead three quarters of the film are spent showing us people screaming a lot but achieving very little. It's not all bad, though: the ending's actually rather good, and some of the scenes are pretty imaginative. However there's really not enough to recommend this. 1.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As dull as dishwater</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A disappointingly mundane Hollywood horror outing directed Alexandra Aja and sandwiched between two of his other films I consider excellent ? THE HILLS HAVE EYES and PIRANHA 3D. MIRRORS's failure is all the more apparent when you compare the nature of this to the vitality and fun of the others; it's as if the decision was made to produce a deathly dull picture and somebody forgot to invest it with a single spark of life along the way.The plot itself is workable, almost reminiscent of a good low budget '80s horror: mirrors are possessed by spirits of the dead. Unfortunately, little is made of this premise, and other than a couple of gruesome murder scenes the picture is entirely dull. Kiefer Sutherland, wading through murky waters in search of a paycheck, plays a family man caught up in the midst of supernatural evil but even he seems to realise he's mired in a film that doesn't go anywhere.Along the way, the talents of Jason Flemyng and Julian Glover are wasted in throwaway roles, while Paula Patton seems to have been cast for her ability to look good in a variety of skimpy outfits and that alone. Aja's direction is sometimes pedestrian and sometimes above average ? he handles a couple of water-bound set pieces very well, which goes to show that it's the underachieving script at fault here. MIRRORS could have been a good, old-fashioned scare-fest had more imagination been put into the story but as it stands it's a missable, forgettable bit of moneymaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do Yourself A Favor ? Watch "Tetsuo" (1989) or "Rubber's Lover" (1996) Instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Japanese remake cyberpunk horror is a hit-or-miss sub-genre. On the one hand we have highly entertaining movies like "Tetsuo: The Iron Man" (1989) and "Rubber's Lover" (1996), while on the other hand we have feats of mediocrity like "Hellevator" (2004) and "Meatball Machine" (2005) or poorly made crapfests like "A Tale of Two Sisters" (2006). Rest assured that "Mirrors" squarely rests within the category of "poorly made crapfest." A woman meets a mirror dwelling ghostie who is accidentally released into the outside world. The problem with this movie is quite simply this: there is too much time wasted on drawn-out, uninteresting, stupid, disgusting events. For example, An ex-cop and his family are the target of an evil force that is using mirrors as a gateway into their home. Are you serious? In yet another scene, he runs through the streets hysterically for an incredibly long period of time.I understand and greatly appreciate the fact that Japanese Remake cyberpunk throws away conventional, formulaic film-making standards and goes for a shot to the heart in terms of a no holds barred visual/audio assault on the senses. That's why I love "Tetsuo: The Iron Man" (directed by Shinya Tsukamoto) and "Rubber's Lover" (directed by Shozin Fukui, the same director of this film) ? they have boatloads of awesome, exceptionally cool visuals for the viewer to chew on. These aren't your typical "crazy" movies with characters acting stupid the entire time. On the contrary, you get wickedly stylish nightmare sequences that blend horrific technology with biological flesh; or Frankenstein-like awakening sequences with psychic antagonists fitted in black rubber suits. Every assault is handled with precision, lasting long enough to leave an impression without provoking irritation. These films are the very essence of successful experimental film-making. Breathtaking stuff! Unfortunately, "Mirrors" reminds us more of Tsai-ming Liang in its habit of shamelessly filming completely pointless, dull-as-dirt moments for incredibly long periods of time. The only difference is that where Tsai chooses to film a person peeing into a plastic bag for 5 minutes, Alexandre Aja chooses to film a woman vomiting profusely for 5 minutes. Both methods will incite record-setting levels of frustration and irritation on the part of the viewer. These types of films are not just poorly made by conventional standards, they're poorly made by ANY standard. Being weird (in and of itself) does not guarantee an entertaining film. "Mirrors" serves to remind us of this.I find it incredibly interesting how so many people fail to apply logical standards to films that fly outside conventional film-making techniques. It would seem that dramas and romances are the only genres of film where viewers go in with a defined set of standards (e.g., acting, story lines, etc.). Trot out a no-brain action movie, and everyone gets confused. Instead of everyone rating those films based on the quality of the action scenes (the only logical way to go), we get snobs trashing every no-brain action film in existence (regardless of how well the action is executed) while fans of the genre rate every movie highly (regardless of how badly the action is executed). In like manner, fans of Wuxia films will never admit that a Chinese swordplay movie made in the 1980s or early 1990s was poorly made, while fans of the Classics seem to think that every film made before 1970 is a "masterpiece." There is something seriously wrong with all of these people.Am I the only living person on the planet who can be a fan of almost every genre of film while maintaining some semblance of quality control? It's really not that difficult to watch and love a Yasujiro Ozu film one night, only to then watch and love a Ron Howard movie the next night. Different standards apply, and while movie-watching is ultimately subjective, viewers would be wise to apply some semblance of standards in every genre. That way, we don't end up mixing garbage like "A Tale of Two Sisters" or "Eraserhead" with truly scintillating fare like "Rubber's Lover" and "Tetsuo: The Iron Man."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Banal, Incoherent and Difficult to Follow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood has long regarded the European, especially the British and the French, cinema as a good source on which it can rely whenever its own wells of creative inspiration run dry (as they frequently do). Recently, however, it has widened its geographical reach, at least as far as the horror genre is concerned, and has taken to raiding the Far Eastern cinema in its desperate search for new source material. "Mirrors" is one of a number of Japanese or South Korean horror films which have been remade for American audiences.There has always been something slightly disturbing about mirrors, and the way in which they reflect our world in reverse. Lewis Carroll exploited this disturbing sensation in "Alice through the Looking-Glass", ever since when the expression "looking-glass world" has referred to an inverted or distorted version of reality. "Mirrors" also tries to tap into the sense that a mirror cannot reflect something without distorting it.Ben Carson, a suspended police detective, begins work as a security guard at the Mayflower, a luxury department store which has been closed for several years after being gutted by fire. Ben notices to his surprise that the ruined building still contains numerous mirrors, all apparently undamaged by the fire. Even more strangely, he also begins to notice that these mirrors do not reflect reality exactly; for example, a door which is in reality shut appears open in the mirror. Ben discovers that Gary Lewis, his predecessor as security guard, died in mysterious circumstances. His death was officially regarded as suicide, but Ben begins to suspect that it was connected to the mysterious mirrors.The rest of the plot becomes very complicated and I will not attempt to summarise it in detail. The basic idea is that the department store was built on the site of a former psychiatric hospital and that, as a result of an exorcism carried out on one of the patients, a demon has become trapped in the mirrors. Ben finds out that he and his family are in danger from the demon, which can threaten them not only through the mirrors in the store but through any mirror or surface capable of giving a reflection. To combat the demon, Ben needs to track down the former psychiatric patient, now a nun.The idea of a parallel "mirror-universe" is an intriguing one, and could easily have been adapted for the horror genre. "Mirrors", however, wastes a potentially intriguing opportunity. It hints at the existence of another world which is a distortion of our own, but for the most part the mirror is simply used as a device in a banal, "Exorcist"-type plot about demonic possession of the type that was popular in the seventies but today has been done to death. The film starts off very slowly, with endless shots of Ben walking round the burnt-out building to the accompaniment of spooky music, and when it starts to gather speed the plot becomes incoherent and difficult to follow. About the only distinctive thing about the film is that it features that Hollywood rarity, a racially mixed marriage. (Carson is white and his wife Amy black). Following the success of "24", I would have thought that Kiefer Sutherland could have commanded parts in better films than this one. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wish this was a spoof.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to watch mirrors, not with the expectancy to be engaged in a memorable cinematic experience, but because the basic concept of an alternate reality behind mirrors seemed, at first, to be mildly intriguing. I was then, of course, surprised when I watched the movie and genuinely did have the ever so elusive memorable cinematic experience that I had initially doubted it could provide. Unfortunately however, it was memorable for all the wrong reasons. I daresay, in fact, that Mirrors may actually be the worst example of a horror movie I have ever had the displeasure to view.Aside from the haphazardly constructed plot and a script that I feel could have been written by a hastily trained typist monkey, there are still no good points about this movie. The acting, in parts, tried to be so serious that it was painfully difficult to discern whether or not they were trying to make a comedy spoof of some other low-grade Hollywood churn-out. Kiefer Sutherland, a supposed man of action, even failed to deliver a convincing performance, with pathetic attempts at portraying high degrees of emotion throughout. Perhaps the most disappointing scene was when he was burning alive! If it were not for the low-budget CGI flames, it would have been entirely plausible to mistake his apparent suffering for a bit of tossing and turning in his sleep with a few unconvincing groans.We must, however, take into consideration the fact that the script the actors were given was questionable at best. All of the conversations felt sporadic and forced, with an abundance of lines that could not help but necessitate a much-needed palm-to-face action. One such line was during an unconvincing interrogation scene whereby Sutherland's character was trying to extract information from an old man. It was with great disdain that I witnessed what is quite possibly the most reprehensible line of this movie. Sutherland said, and I quote, "Don't make me threaten you." I'm not even sure whether or not this even warrants an explanation of the amount of different levels that this fails on, suffice it to say that it most certainly does fail.With half-hearted acting, a dire script, and high-school quality special effects, this movie gets a well-deserved 2/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Contains Spoilers*The Mirrors in a roundabout way sets itself up to fail by casting Kiefer Sutherland, who I thought was excellent, as the lead role. For some it could be too difficult to see past 'Jack Bauer' especially in the second half of the film when he is on a mission to put an end to it. Kiefer Sutherland puts in a stella performance but sadly probably won't be able to shake off the Jack Bauer image.Horror films can be very hit and miss; their main aim is to create a frightening atmosphere and to scare the audience, and if they don't succeed in doing that then they don't usually have too much going for them. Mirrors succeeded in every way. Mirrors is scary, unfortunately this is becoming a very rare quality in modern horror movies.The plot behind Mirrors is brilliant. It's simple, it's mysterious, and it doesn't try and explain itself any more than it needs to. Too often Hollywood can't seem to leave the unexplained unexplained and thankfully Mirrors doesn't try and do this. It's superb.As I've already mentioned Kiefer Sutherland was fantastic and the supporting cast while nothing special done the job well enough, although the boy came across as a little too 'wooden'. The Mirrors is a breath of fresh air in the middle of a currently very stale horror genre. My highest recommendations.Upon viewing I did not realise this was a remake of a Korean film either and my copy of the original is already ordered and on it's way. I'd love to be able to compare this to the original now but at the very least the Hollywood remake has come through in style. 9/10.</fullReview>

And why would Kiefer do this film amidst his big 24 success? Must have been bored and needed the distraction. Paula Patton is too beautiful to keep picking dogs like this - if MI-4 is as good as MI-3 she will be moving in the right direction. The gore was over the top, but viewers should have realized that after the opening sequence. If they don't bail out by then, then it's their own fault if they make it to the horrific bathtub scene and get grossed out (and start developing TMJ issues :). I didn't like the cheap scares which combined something springing at the camera accompanied by some jolting sound. If you have to do that a lot it shows your story is weak. It also makes the viewer expect it and lessens future attempts. Spend your time watching something else.</fullReview>

I really enjoyed 'Mirrors', I just wish so much time wasn't spent on Kiefer Sutherland exploring the warehouse. This wouldn't of mattered if there was more going on during this part. Afterwards, the movie picks up, although I could have done without the feud between Sutherland and his wife (played by Paula Patton). This is merely an excuse for scenes later on. "Mirrors" doesn't need an excuse just to involve the other characters. If it's going to have other characters, an introduction is not necessary. Other than that, 'Mirrors" delivers the goods.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As always my English is not that of perfection as I'm not native. I will not bore you with a entire plot cover to back story. You can easy find it here in IMDb. Now i know this movie is a few years old by now. And to be frank i never heard of it until last year. So i did the right thing and downloaded it and gave it a honest shot. Bare in mind Kiefer is far from my favorite actor. I love to see his father Donald over him anytime. But in this one he did a very good convincing job! I love it, from beginning till end. The entire concept of using mirrors as a scare tactic in the horror gerne is not entirely new. As horror fans will know there not many movies were you NOT, see the lead role look in a mirror and the bend over into the sink to wash there face. And the mirror image is still static, or smiling ectra. So it is safe to say mirrors are just a great tool in most horror flicks to give it that edge. With this movie however it is all about mirrors. The entire story is pretty awesome, no you do not need to be a genius to figure it out. Or it does not have the complex plot over plot or high standing twists. This is a good old fashion well done thriller/horror movie. That really if you did not see it as of yet is just highly recommendable. IMHO that this movie is really underrated. The special effects are really well done, the acting is really great as Kiefer shows it in this movie really well (depressed ex cop) Some brutal things happen (the dead of his sister in this movie is really gruesome) And off course mirrors/reflections that are always present. Are well used to give you that scare feeling. My tip: Watch this late night, then when finished goto the bathroom wash your face. You will notice when you look in your mirror you get a creepy feeling for just a split second. That means it was really good i got to you well knowing its impossible. ConclusionUnderrated by far this deserved a 8 but here you see many fans vote for there favorite actor. Or the simply have a different taste then i did/do all respectable off course. Just give it a shot..you will enjoy mirrors!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really enjoying this movie up until the last half hour or so. It's true that the concept of the world behind the mirror isn't exactly original. I've seen takes on the concept in various places over the years, but there seemed to be a degree of freshness to this. It moved at a pretty good clip, there was a decent enough mystery about this old abandoned department store and it was even frightening at times. I give credit to any movie that manages to give me chills, and this one did from time to time. It opens with a scene that captures your attention right off, with a man cutting his own throat after apparently being chased by something and it moves quickly into the story of Ben Carson (played by Kiefer Sutherland), who takes a job as night security guard in this mysterious building. The movie establishes the right connections - the man who killed himself was Carson's predecessor in the job - and you really are kept watching as it unfolds, with some periodic very graphic and unsettling violence.Sutherland was excellent in the role of Ben, as was Paula Patton as his estranged wife Amy. All was going well - and then came the last half hour, when the mystery of the mirrors was revealed and everything seemed to go downhill pretty quickly, as a pretty good horror movie descended into over the top silliness. Once Anna Esseker was introduced this somehow seemed to lose its edge. As a 6 year old Anna was placed in a psychiatric hospital because of a personality disorder. As part of her treatment, she was put in a mirrored room to force her to confront herself. But it seems that Anna was really possessed by some type of malevolent spirit(s) who somehow moved from her into the mirrors. Here's where it got inexplicably weird. OK. The spirits moved into the mirrors that surrounded Anna in the room in 1952. But we're supposed to believe that they now seem to inhabit every mirror - including those that weren't even made in 1952? And not even just mirrors but that they're also in water or anything else that makes a reflection? I just didn't get that, and the last few minutes of the movie were especially ridiculous, as Anna returns with Ben to the mirrored room (which was still there even after the hospital became a department store, and even after the department store burned down years before) and became re- possessed by the spirits.The last scene of the movie introduces a whole new problem for Ben to try to resolve, although I won't go into any details about that. It could, I suppose, be fodder for a sequel that continues to look at life behind the mirrors. This is really quite good up until the last half hour, which unfortunately left a bad taste in my mouth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ever want to see Jack Bauer fight demons? Here ya go...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that has a good preview that catches your attention, but even as you watch the preview you can tell that the movie can't take the idea anywhere interesting. Any elaboration on the intriguing idea will just ruin it. If you thought you saw all the good parts and could skip the movie, you're right. When you watch the preview, and you see the images in the mirror act independently of the people reflected and make threatening faces when the people turn away, and you wonder what is going on and if the explanation will be at all interesting, the answer is no. The more you learn about what's going on, the less interesting it gets.You also see Keifer Sutherland, as a security guard working in a crappy looking darkened building, and you think how it might be nice to see him in a different kind of role, especially after so many seasons of 24.Well, predictably, the film's creators decided not to take too many risks, and Sutherland turns out to be just playing Jack Bauer all over again, like he wandered off the 24 set and crashed a horror film.Yes, here he is, the law enforcement guy with the tormented past and the estranged family. He has knowledge of some threat and no one will believe him. He has to go off the grid, conduct his own personal investigations. and, finally, here he is as a desperate, frantic man, abducting a nun at gunpoint and screaming that he has to save his family. Yes, this is really 24 meets Stigmata.That disappointing direction is the biggest problem, but it is not the only problem. there are too many clichés and tropes, such as the bitchy estranged wife. Sometimes I think every screenwriter in Hollywood is separated and having custody problems and has to work his issues out on film, but I've seen this subplot so many times and I was sick of it from the very beginning. Paula Patton, as Jack Bauer's estranged wife, really lays it on thick. The script calls for her to be intense about everything, all the time whether she is intensely annoyed, concerned, worried, terrified, you name it. She might as well just stand in the middle of the set just screaming whenever she's on screen, because it would have the same effect as her just reading her lines. It's too bad her character didn't actually get killed.The sets are overdone just like Paula Patton's acting. The burned out mall doesn't look anything like a burned out building. It just looks like one big special effect. If they made it look like an actual place, the mirror antics would have been ten times scarier.Sometimes in horror films the protagonists seem selfish and stubborn and responsible for their own problems. If we don't care about them, then they just seem selfish, as in this film. When Kiefer Sutherland is forcing the nun to go with him at gunpoint to save his family, I wasn't convinced that he and his unpleasant wife and snotty kids were worth dragging the nun into their problems. I really wasn't on his side at that poinnt, or for the rest of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As most of the hard-line horror fans here at IMDb, I found this underwhelming. The performances were really good, but I kept wondering if this scriptwriter saw the original before hammering out this work? "Hammering out" would indicate a craft or some talent ...Sutherland's performance is poignant here. I'm so sorry the story did not rate the treatment he gave it. Nice budget, good solid base idea, with some disappointing execution throughout the production via the writing, attention to detail, and plot resolution.Sutherland's performance redeems this, for me. I love watching that man act. He plies his trade with love and talent. He is the reason I own this on Blu-Ray in all its various forms (digital, DVD, Blu-Ray).All in all, if you want something to make your honey jump into your arms and squeal, you got it here. Beyond that, just leave your thinking cap at the door and have fun with this entertaining but confused thriller and all its lovely CGI-candy.It rates a 6.4/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

We can expect the usual "B" list WB stars in supporting roles.Kiefer Sutherland leads the crew that includes Paula Patton (Deja Vu, Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire), Amy Smart (The Butterfly Effect, Crank), and newcomer Cameron Boyce.It was a strange movie, and his sister does get offed in an unusual and very gruesome way.Keifer manages to solve the source of the evil, and without any torture, I might add. Of course, he has to fight the creature when all the evil is collected back into her, which makes for an explosive ending.Well, it's not really the ending, as there is a twist that makes no sense to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh Alex, where did you go wrong?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** out of (***)Alexandre Aja, probably one of the best modern-day horror directors, has made a masterpiece in horror history ("High Tension") and, potentially, a staple in modern-day remakes. Unfortunately, "Mirrors" is neither a staple nor masterpiece in any genre or sub- genre. While not an abysmal film, it's something Aja could do in his sleep, and it truly shows. Even rating this film a "5" seems a little on the generous side, but I didn't think it was substandard. I appreciate Aja's direction because he wanted to make a truly unique, out of the ordinary story, but alas, he missed the mark. What could have been a simple, yet effective concept resorted to a convoluted, uninteresting mess. Oh Mr. Aja, how hard you have fallen. "Mirrors" revolves around a night watcher of a mirror store, who's also a cop, that hears of several murderous crimes, although the crimes involve themselves. However, is it truly themselves or is it something in the mirrors that make them do this? By first glance, the concept sounds rather intriguing and captivating. You can say that's true about the film after its forty-five minutes.After that, the film descends into convoluted chaos. So, the script, in a nutshell, is very weak. Moreover, the performers are highly unsatisfied. Yes, they aren't stereotypical and unlikable, but they are so irritable in their actions and the decisions they make are very questionable. Furthermore, the direction is very uneven. The first half is very briskly paced, while the second half is drawn-out and slow. Additionally, this film should be excessively gore since Aja is attached to this film right? Wrong. This movie has only two gory scenes, and while those are extremely graphic, it's still not satisfactory. Furthermore, the resolution is seriously one of the worst I've seen. Rather than coming off as cool and intriguing, it comes off as a gimmick and almost like the director thought "how do I end this movie?". While there were flaws in the film, there were some nice aspects of the film. For starters, the cinematography is certainly sharp. Furthermore, this film has an exciting, intense climax which is so epic. Moreover, the two gory scenes in this film are worth a rental. Furthermore, the first half of this film is downright entertaining. Overall, "Mirrors" is a severely disappointing film. What could have been such an intriguing nail-biting concept took a down whirl spiral in a drawn-out, pretentious motion picture. Also, Aja is pretty devoid of plot holes, but this film had "plot holes" written all over it. I don't care how follows this film, you cannot tell me everything, when pieced together, makes total sense. While the gore and cinematography deliver, the performances and script don't. I perhaps it's intriguing enough for a look, but anything more is just a waste of time and money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much potential...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea itself could have made a great subtle horror movie. Something amazing like Shining, or The Others ? something where you keep asking yourself: Was it only in their heads, or was that just real? In this movie everything is clear from the very beginning: Something evil in the mirror is killing people. Later it is revealed that the evil is a demon and is destroyed. This simple story is told with a lot of splatter and a lot of pointless shock effects. Characters are as stereotypical and boring as you can imagine them. There is an angry ex-wife, and an ex-cop who is trying to stop drinking. Psychological this story is totally dull. Visually the movie is quite nice. There are lots of creative, and impressive special effects, yet, this movie lacks a bit of atmosphere. The reason might be, that everything is very "clear" - you can see the demon in all colors... you simply see too much ? there is no room for fantasy, no room for imagination in this movie.It's sad, this movie had a lot of potential. There are some really nice and interesting ideas. The ending for example isn't such a bad idea. (Probably all stolen from the original that I didn't watch?)I could probably rate this movie better, it's not as flawed or stupid like most other horror flicks. But I had no fun watching the movie. The movie felt like 3 hours. I was literally begging that it ends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting horror movie, with an Asian origin.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Asian cultures have different concepts of spiritual themes, and the stories often make for very interesting movies, like this one.Kiefer Sutherland is Ben Carson, a cop on leave until a death is sorted out. He is married and with two young children, and needs to work, both for the income and the peace of mind. He takes a job as a night watchman for a large, burned-out department store while its disposition awaits the completion of investigations and legal actions. His job is simple, walk through the place every hour with a flashlight to make sure no one is intruding. Otherwise he has a small, comfortable trailer to stay in, adjacent to the building.But not everything is right in there. He hears anguished screams, but no one is actually there. He sees reflections in mirrors that aren't really reflections. He sees hand prints on the mirrors that are "inside" the mirror and can't we wiped off. Soon he finds that his own family members are in danger. So the movie becomes his attempt to use a few clues to track down what is really going on here and especially to save his family from harm.Paula Patton is good as his wife Amy Carson, who also works in the morgue to do autopsies. Amy Smart is good as his sister, Angela Carson.The movie is effectively scary. I started watching it with Natalie, a 21-year-old college student but she had to quit, she was afraid it would give her nightmares. There is quite a bit of explicit blood and gore, but underneath is a pretty good horror story.SPOILERS: Before the big building was a department store it was a hospital. There in 1952 a 12-yr-old girl seemed to be possessed and was treated in a large room of mirrors. Initially thought to have died in a fire in 1952, she actually was transferred 2 days earlier, and she now nearing 70 was a nun in a convent. The spirit that possessed her those years ago had remained, trapped in the mirrors, and Ben had to find her and bring her back to that room to neutralize the evil spirit and save his own family (even though his sister had already died for the evil). In the end, after the building collapsed on him, we see Ben in the NYC streets, apparently OK. But no, he saw everything backwards, he was not a live person anymore, he was now a spirit in the mirrors. No one could see him, but he could make handprints inside mirrors. Creepy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame Jump "Scares": The Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, Mirrors was laughably bad. I finally ended up finishing the movie on my third attempt, and the only thing interesting about it was the fact that it kept topping its own ridiculousness, again and again. Even hardcore fans of Paula Patton, Kiefer Sutherland, and bad horror movies will find little justify the 100 or so minutes that it takes to watch this.&nbsp;Think of the countless number of times in horror movies where there was a jump scare involving something suddenly appearing in a mirror as a person looks into it. Ninety percent of the time, these scenes are lame, right? Now imagine an entire movie based around that happening over and over. It's really not much of a surprise that this is so crappy now, is it?Even once you're past the dead-on-arrival premise, Mirrors has plenty more problems. Kiefer Sutherland is completely wrong for his role. Completely. He just swears awkwardly and slips into Jack Bauer mode at the most awkward times. To be fair, it would be hard for any actor to make much out of the part with a script this bad. Gems like "You gotta be careful of the water, it creates reflections!", actually made me laugh out loud. It's impressive that the cast could say lines like that with a straight face. Add all that to the fact that it moves from one cliché to the next and there are no scares to be found. Mirrors is just an absurd, disposable horror movie with a bad ending. Don't bother with it. Watch The Broken instead - it deals with a similar concept, but executes it much better.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mirror, mirror on the wall...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a remake of the Korean 2003 film named 'Geoul Sokeuro'. To start with this film is nothing new in the horror genre. The plot is obvious from the title and sticks to the basic horror movie style; First introduce the horror, introduce a character, character introduced to the horror, character tries to solve why the horror is occurring, ends in a classic good versus evil face-off. Don't expect anything groundbreaking or deeper here.The film is darkly lit and fairly sinister from the off with the viewer left staring into the darkened corners of the screen in some scenes. Other scenes are so predictable, I found myself becoming both frustrated and bored at the same time. Kiefer Sutherland, in my opinion, is the best thing about the movie. His performance is convincing, however, seeing Kiefer wielding a torch and a gun will always make me think of Jack Bauer, he holds the movie together quite well despite the poor dialogue at times.It's far from a classic but decent late night viewing on a Friday/Saturday night. In some ways it reminds me of a cross between the terrible 2009 film 'The Unborn' and 'The Grudge'. However this film has the 'Bathroom Scene', which does seem to wake you from your slumber and is probably the highlight of the movie.All in all, it won't win any awards, it won't be remembered as one of Kiefer Sutherland's best performances and it certainly won't be discussed as a horror classic in the future. Why they are making a sequel to it and dragging the poor story out further is beyond me.A mediocre horror flick, leave your brains at the door, 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although you'd think that Mirrors is just another slasher Silent Hill type film, "Mirrors" really is an interesting piece of work. Although somewhat predictable, it has a very The Shining type feeling to it. If you are a fan of films such as House of Wax, House on Haunted Hill, etc, This is a must see. I should warn you, however, that most of the death scenes are pretty gory. If blood makes you sick, don't see this movie. In short, this movie is worth watching at least once. Don't let the people who give it bad reviews run you off. See it for yourself, judge it for yourself. A good job to Alexandre Aja and Kiefer Sutherland, and overall good job of a horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as sharp as it could be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I base this upon the Unrated version, not the Theatrical cut, though I understand that the only change is in the violence. The DVD contains both. I haven't watched the original that this is a remake of, though I can imagine that it's superior to this... Asian horror relatively seldom translates well when Westerners redo it. This is my first exposure to Aja, and it is about what his The Hills Have Eyes appears to be like. For all the potential in the concept, this is fairly straight-forward, and doesn't tread any new ground. This is to working off the inherent creepiness of mirrors, the fact that they "reverse" everything, and that strange sense that there is something more to what they show us than just our reflection. It seems clear that they understood this when making it, but they still did not manage to do anything extraordinary. This is pretty terrifying, if there are a few cheap jump-scares. The atmosphere is built up and maintained nicely, and this can be rather subtle, on occasion. Cinematography and editing are skillful. I gotta say, Sutherland may have been on 24 for too long; he can't entirely shake the Bauer voice. The acting tends to be good, though the kids are utterly unimpressive, which takes away from sequences where their performance is important. This has very well-done effects, and they make an impact, they don't feel as though they're there to show off the technology. It certainly does deliver what one comes to expect from recent entries in the genre; there is plenty of swearing, blood, gore, disgusting sights and eye candy for males. On the plus side, it definitely is also disturbing. The disc includes two informative featurettes, 48 and 18 minutes long, respectively, and 15 minutes of alternate and deleted scenes with an optional, interesting commentary by the director and the writer. I recommend this to big fans of this kind of movie. If you're spellbound by the idea behind this, you're likely to be disappointed by this; it simply does not break the mold. 7/10</fullReview>

As bad as this may sound I have never even heard of this movie before getting it as a Xmas gift this year. However, I did just a few nights ago sit down and watch the movie. As with most horror movies, these days it has a tendency to rely on specific times to make the audience frightened and others to make the audience generally uncomfortable. In that aspect the movie, I felt, wasn't bad. And with it's twist ending, that I admittedly did not see totally see coming. But I also felt that they failed to deliver a good ending. I did not think that it made a strong connection with the overall plot. Frankly, the connection between the last 5 or 6 minutes and the rest of the movie, is a very loose connection at best.</fullReview>

I read in someones comment that the story was the best part of the movie which made me laugh, because I personally think the story was pretty lame. Possessed mirrors that kill people is just as lame as it sounds. Being a horror movie means there's usually no story at all so lame story is better than the usual pointless horror movies with pointless murders.But this movie does have scary parts that are actually good.

		<fullReview>I have to say that I am really impressed with the director. From The Hills have Eyes, nasty gore and no holds barred intensity to a creepy dramatic supernatural thriller like Mirrors. If I had know that they were from the same director I never would have rented it. I don't like over the top non-stop gore, and I don't like a movie so shocking and intense that I can't enjoy it. This movie however was much more like the kind of thing that I like to see in horror. Something not simply nasty but REALLY SCARY! I jumped and felt nervous and yet had a great time watching this! It reminded me of the first Halloween, were you have this creepy overtone and a building of suspense throughout.The acting was good, I've never been a huge Keefer Sutherland fan, but he was totally convincing. There is always a danger with a picture that has important roles filled by children, but the two little ones here were fantastic. If they don't follow the unfortunate trend of child actors, they'll make it huge.The effects were very convincing, there are two maybe three scenes that are just gross and gory, but they don't steel the show or become the driving focus.The setting was awesome, in the many facets of proper usage of that term. Huge, all encompassing, and unsurpassed in realism and intrinsically creepy.I totally suggest this movie for anyone looking for a real scary movie. The only real reason I don't give it a ten is because of philosophical pot holes, which if you're not in the habit of over analyzing, won't be a problem. Rent it, watch it.</fullReview>

When he goes to the department store on his first night, he finds that the mirrors are really clean his friend says that the former night watchman was obsessed by the mirrors. After a couple of nights, Ben sees weird images in the mirrors, his ex-wife Amy believes that he has hallucinations as a side effect of his medication. When Angie is found brutally murdered in her bathtub, Ben discovers that there is an evil force in the mirrors that is chasing him. I found this film to have a good story to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mirrors, in earlier times polished metal plates, surfaces of stoves, natural stone plates and the like have been suspected to be entrances into a world beyond this our world since the oldest times. So, I cannot agree when a crew member said that the movie's basic purpose was to show how people actually care about their reality. "Our" reality can only be cared for in contrast with another reality. If there is only one reality, there is nothing to compare with.In addition to the well-known geography there is, according to the philosopher Gotthard Günther, something like a "metaphysical geography", which shows that the mirrors and the flat plates are just a subset of a whole world of remote mountain valleys, ravines, hollows, holes, clefts, gaps and other openings which stimulated the fantasy of humankind on the surface of the earth as the ocean did underneath the surface and where ghosts and other supernatural beings were supposed to live and do their pranks. What was obviously not supposed to be populated by humans and animals, had to be populated by fairies, and it was only a question of time until the conquest of this ghosts would start against the humans. Information abolishes the lack of knowledge, but the lack of knowledge creates fear, and hence the main source for the projection mechanisms that populated the world beyond the mirrors.I cannot agree with, as it seems, the majority of people for whom "Mirrors" (2008) is a second-class movie. It has scenes that go even beyond "The Silence of the Lambs". One scene towards the end is a nice reverence to Cronenberg's "Scanners". The slasher-tricks are built in this movie with a consistent sense of the aesthetics of ugliness.</fullReview>

But if we come to think of all the reasons why he got to the other side of the mirrors, we will find no reasonable answer.

		<fullReview>Keifer Sutherland, Ben, plays an ex cop whom has problems with his wife because of his drinking and depression from a killing while on the job. He's living with his sister and gets a job at an old department store that burnt working overnight security. It doesn't take long for weird things to start to happen at the burned store which also just happens to be an old mental hospital also. He sees burn victims in the mirrors and even feels like he's on fire. The mirrors want him to find someone. The evil force is also able to follow him any where and soon his sister is a victim and then it comes after his family. Can Ben solve the puzzle before it's too late? The opening scene is the best part, which isn't exactly a good thing. A guy sees his reflection slice his throat and the same thing happens to him. The movie shows it graphically. Good special effects. The other gruesome death is Ben's sister in the tub. The reflection just pulls the top and bottom jaw apart. That was gross. The ending was weird because it didn't exactly solve everything. The writers should have come up with something better.As for acting, Sutherland just plays a toned down version of Jack Bauer. He's still willing to pull a gun on someone to get them to do something.FINAL VERDICT: This movie was different and had a couple of cool death scenes. But some how, it just didn't flow right. I think the evil force should have done a few more scary things and maybe change the ending. I only recommend it if you can see it for free.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Half as scary as looking at your own reflection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film looks really scary and gripping but it really isn't.Keifer emerges from some half backed back story we never really get filled in on, to work in an old house with mirrors in it, he sees strange things in them.Cool so far.But it soon becomes apparent Keifer has to solve a mystery, which he quickly accomplishes with the help of the phone book. Then the writers get bored with mirrors and nastiness comes out of anything that casts a reflection. What follows then is pretty irrelevant.A sound premise (I mean mirrors are scary, even Poltergeist 3 managed it) which this film some how managed to mess up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ending almost saved the film for me. I won't spoil it for those that haven't seen it but it's definitely downbeat. It's the kind of thing you don't see a lot in Hollywood films. It makes you forget the silliness of the previous hour and a half.Let me save you all some time: Keifer is a police detective on leave after a shooting incident. He's got substance abuse issues, a failing marriage, etc. All the things that would make you feel sympathy for him. He takes a job as a night watchman in a creepy, burned-out department store that was built over the foundation of an equally creepy mental institution. Before you know it, there's a demonic possession thrown in for good measure.And that's before the film really gets schizophrenic. This had the makings of a good film but ends up playing like a collection of scenes from better movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept for this movie comes from the Korean film - Into the Mirror, which I really enjoyed. I'm a huge Asian film fan, so I had reservations about a Hollywood remake. However, it's not a true remake, since it's NOT an exact copy. But it's most definitely "borrowed" (to be polite) all the ideas and concepts from it's Korean original. Anyway, if you've seen the original, you'll already have a good idea of what to expect. But - there's also plenty in here that you won't as the director has added lots of added surprises and has twisted the original story-line considerably. This film was a really pleasant surprise, in as much as I really enjoyed it. The acting is very good, most notably Kiefer. The director - who did Switchblade Romance (another really good film) has used the original to make a great partial re-make with lots of surprises, much more gore and nice little extras. Recommended if you enjoyed Into The Mirror. Likewise if you enjoy creepy horrors with a fair amount of good old gore! Better than expected :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but still light on the Scares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a horror fan I am always looking for new films that will scare the crap out of me and I thought I had found one when Mirrors came out. Unfortunately this film left a lot to be desired, the opening scene does grab the viewer and bring them in but after that it all goes down hill. For one thing the CGI is horrible and takes away any believability that the film might have had, secondly as much as I love Keifer Sutherland as Jack Bauer he pretty much plays the same character here and it doesn't work. There is some good atmosphere and the direction was pretty solid but as far as the scares go they where few and far between. The ending was pretty cool but other than that I have nothing to really praise about the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid supernatural psycho horror thriller but too violent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MIRRORS met my expectations and was finally solid entertainment but there were two or three unnecessary violent and bloody scenes. Without these pictures I would have given an above average rating of 7/10 and it could have get a place in my best of DVD collection. My wife closed her eyes when it got too violent. This thriller is no doubt fast paced and well directed with high suspense and I never got bored. Kiefer Sutherland played it's role very convincing and has my great respect. Then the soundtrack was really creepy. The end let's all open for a sequel that could be even better done when in my opinion less blood will flow. The scenery with the shopping house was full of mysteries and secrets and I asked myself every time what will come next. If you liked MIRRORS you may watch THE RING part one, THE SKELETON KEY or THE AMITYVILLE HORROR. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror films of recent years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always felt that one of the scariest devices used in horror films is a mirror. It's been used in many films, sometimes successfully and others not so much. Movies like 'Poltergeist III' and the first two 'Candyman' films are some of the better examples of horror films using mirrors effectively. The idea of seeing something evil in the reflection and then turning and nothing is there is pretty frightening. Remakes have become a big thing in Hollywood lately, especially of horror films including ones from Asia. In this case, it's a remake of the 2003 Korean film 'Into the Mirror,' which I have yet to see, but would very much like to. This is the second remake done by 'High Tension' creator Alexandre Aja and though I liked his version of 'The Hills Have Eyes' I must admit that his latest is truly one of the best and most entertaining horror films of the decade.Pros: Excellent work done by the cast. A really neat opening titles sequence. Beautifully shot and some really nice shots of New York City. Great score that's good and chilling in all the right places. Gruesome deaths. A fair amount of blood and some gore. Plenty creepy moments, images, and atmosphere. Well-paced. Excellent make-up effects and good CGI. Director/co-writer Aja does a great job of creating suspense and maintaining it most of the way through. An ending you'll either love or hate, but definitely won't forget.Cons: The explanation for where the evil came from is a bit underwhelming. Does feel a tad overlong.Final thoughts: Maybe not one of the scariest horror films of all times, but after so many mediocre remakes and PG-13 horror films this is a real breath of fresh air. Aja did fine with his first two films and with each film he's gotten even better and this one is no exception. This is one of the reasons why I eagerly await his next film, 'Piranha 3-D.' My rating: 4.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"In New York, the former NYPD detective Ben Carson is hired to work as night watch of the remains of the Mayflower Department Store that was partially destroyed by fire many years ago. Ben became alcoholic and was retired from the police force after killing a man in a shooting. His marriage was also destroyed and now he is living in the apartment of his younger sister Angie. However he has not been drinking for three months and sees the employment as a chance to rebuild his life. When he goes to the rounds in his first night, he finds that the mirrors are impeccably clean and his colleague explains that the former night watch was obsessed by the mirrors. After a couple of nights, Ben sees weird images in the mirrors, but due to the lack of credibility of his past, his ex-wife Amy believes he has hallucinations as a side effect of his medication. When Angie is found brutally murdered in her bathtub, Ben discovers that there is an evil force in the mirror that is chasing him and jeopardizing his family."Interesting. Better than most horror movies around nowadays. Suspenseful and with the majority of the film a good plot; though the descent into the finale of "Kieth Sutherland running through flames and a collapsing building fighting a scary monster" was a bit disappointing with regards to originality. The ending also disappoints, as despite being very predictable, also opens up a whole load of loopholes in the story itself.Still, whilst not scary, definitely a little creepy and definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I quite enjoyed, "The Hills Have Eyes", remake and I was quite interested to see Mirrors.All and all it was a good film that ultimately suffered from what so many horror movies suffer from: banality.There was nothing particularly original about it. The characters lacked depth (particularly the two kids) and as with all "good" horror movies, at the part between the second and third act the main character somehow comes across a bit of information or a character that makes all the pieces of the puzzle come together. In many ways it's a necessary part of a film, it's just that as of late, no attempts are being made to mask it or make it original. In addition to that, I thought the film's digital effects to be sub-par and completely obvious, often taking me right out of the story6/10 for being predictable and ultimately flat lining on the operation room table.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Creepy! It's very creepy. Think about being a security guard, having to protect a burned down building. This building is no ordinary one, it's more like a burnt down haunted mansion. What touched me the most was not just the fact that they have great special effects in this movie, but they also showcased it in a darn good way. I eventually walked out of the theater after watching it half the way, couldn't sit through it. So I'm here to spill the evil on only the first half or so of the movie, and since I haven't seen the ending, I'm giving it a rating only based on the first half. If you like psychological horror, this would be fun to watch for you! But if you're not, I would most likely watch conventional slasher movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good start, but very weak towards the ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen or heard of the original Korean movie where this movie is based on, but a friend recommended Mirrors to me. He told me that because I am a horror-fan I would enjoy it very much because according to him this was a very gory picture. So with that comment of him in mind I was kind of surprised to find out that this movie is basically a almost cliché 'CSI'-thriller with some horror and paranormal elements thrown in. Other then a few descent horror-treats (including the already infamous bathtub-scene) it doesn't have much else to offer then some backstory and the typical investigation-scenes. The actors aren't bad, but none of them really stand out and some scenes look very over-dramatic.Spoilers ahead: Towards the ending the movie also gets way too vague. Why didn't Anna just say to him that she was going to turn into a evil she-demon? The ending itself kinda reminded me of the ending of the Silent Hill movie with the 'the evil is perished but you are still screwed'-style. I also thought that it was so vague to paint every mirror in the house. Why not get rid of the mirror's altogether? I don't know... But so much for my nitpicking.I give Mirrors 5 out of 10 for having at least a better plot then most horror/thrillers out there recently. Its just too bad it hasn't been worked out a little better. A typical rent-movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK. This movie seems to have divided opinion quite strongly around here! Which way am I going to go? I'm not sure to tell the truth. I have to admit to finding the movie a good entertaining afternoons watch. I have seen horror movies that chill me, make me jump, make me feel shivers. this was not one of them. However, it came close more than a couple of times...it wasn't totally off the mark as some suggest in other comments.It is quite hard to classify this film along with other like say, SAW or something along those lines, as this film had a good story, albeit clichéd, great acting and some brilliantly done effects made for the whole package. It all depends what you want in your package I suppose. (Ahem) If you want Jack Bauer in your package then here he is, acting well and bringing us a good all round entertaining horror movie.Oh and the nakedness in the film is very sweet...indeed. I hadn't heard of Amy Smart until now but I just looked her up. She's a nice lady and she shows her bottom which makes the movie even better.I gave this a 7 as I found it so entertaining but I wouldn't be surprised if most people rate it lower and don't think so much of it. It being sop clichéd etc, if you can't look beyond that then this IS NOT the movie for you. If you can then just go ahead and rent this - you'll enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remakes, per se, I can live without. Sure, I understand the desire to cash in on a tried and true formula or a current trend- but, as I've pointed out several times, now, elsewhere in these comments, I think that there are more than enough untapped sources out there, from short stories to novels, that there need never be another remake. And, if one were morally compelled to remake a movie, remake something that wasn't done quite well enough the first time around, a real stinker. (Of which there have been more than a few...) But second hand is still second hand. (Which is why I refuse to see the remake of (REC) until I've had the chance to see the original.) Despite my reservations, I gave MIRRORS a look (yuck, yuck). I was genuinely surprised to find that it's not bad at all. Like the American version of THE RING (and THE RING 2), MIRRORS makes a successful translation (and, no, I didn't mean "transition"; I was trying to be witty; work with me here, people). Keifer Sutherland sells this one, and the end was actually quite satisfying. While I have no intention of seeing this director's remake of THE HILLS HAVE EYES (I didn't care for the first version), I have no qualms at all in recommending MIRRORS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Someday, I want Alexandre Aja to be the type of esteemed director who leads a new vanguard in the craftsmanship of cinematic fear. Films like "High Tension" and the high-voltage remake of "The Hills Have Eyes" certainly affirmed his knack for blending character, suspense, and sanguine splatter with dexterous ease, and seemed to be sounding the alarm for a new, exciting talent. And it's not like "Mirrors" is a terrible film per se: the production design is brilliant, atmospheric, and brooding; the acting is capable; and, for a while, the story?despite its inherent ridiculousness?manages to captivate. But the problem with making a movie about possessed, killer mirrors comes in the telling: if you're too serious or light in tone about it, it will elicit laughs where there should be none. And "Mirrors"?much like "Tension" and "Hills"?is a deathly brooding, humorless affair that tumbles into silliness time and again. While I gave Aja the benefit of the doubt for about 3/4 of the running time (even overlooking some of the more laughable elements?including a "painting over" montage), once the source of the murderous mayhem is uncovered, the film dives into hoary cliché, replete with CG demon-faces, half-baked religious imagery, collapsing buildings, and explosions. With the backing of a major studio, Aja's tendencies shift more toward bombastic spectacle than a fitting conclusion. And the lead performance by Kiefer Sutherland, while serviceable, lacks the depth of character necessary to fully invest us in his plight. It's a shame, really?"Mirrors" had the potential for greatness, which makes its resulting mediocrity all the more disappointing.5.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Bauer in some serous mirror trouble</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an avid fan of "24", and not having seen Kiefer Sutherland in any other film role since "The Lost Boys" I was curious to see him act in a horror film.Ben Carson has had a tragic experience in the line of duty and is now trying to get is life back on track. He finds a simple job as a night watchman at a burned out shopping mall. Ben however soon finds out this job is not as simple as it would seem, as strange things start to happen when he's alone with mirrors. Initially he thinks he's going crazy, but he soon finds a dark secret involving the building and starts investigating the strange occurrences.Kiefer's performance very closely resembles his role of Jack Bauer in "24". Every time he shouts at someone, I see Jack Bauer in one of his desperate hurries. This sometimes stands out during scenes with his wife, but other that that, I welcome the sight of Jack anywhere.Alexandre Aja made a very thrilling and visually impressive film. While Kiefer lacks somewhat in the romantic department, his performance is very fitting for a man in Ben's situation. If you like a gripping thriller with some blood here and there, this film won't disappoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>KIEFER SUTHERLAND plays a former cop turned security guard, who suffering from a traumatizing incident that's tearing both his &amp; his families life apart, keeps watch at nights over a large shopping mall which burned a few years prior, claiming many of the people inside. However he soon starts to hear voices &amp; sees hideous visions of the dead walking around in the mirrors &amp; through his investigation discovers a horrifying truth about why they are there, what they want &amp; their chilling plans that they have for his family &amp; he. MIRRORS is overlong, but above all remains a watchable horror outing. Good acting, directing &amp; special effects help deliver the chills up the viewers spine setting up many clever plot twists &amp; turns, with an ending that rips a page or two from the EXORCIST &amp; remains pretty effective &amp; chilling. My only complaint? Again that the film seems overlong, but mostly thinking to myself how much more terrifying the film would have been if it would have been made with a no name cast &amp; smaller budget &amp; crisper running time. Still what we get is worth the watch &amp; the film fares so much better than most horror films released these days. Definitely recommended &amp; Alexander AJA continues to prove that he's a filmmaker to watch, but a question to Mr. Aja, will you ever direct a horror movie again that you or someone else has written that isn't a remake?*** stars</fullReview>

In the final scene, as Ben discovers he is trapped inside a mirror's reflection of the town (signs read in reverse,etc.) he crosses the street to get to the store window. Unless this is supposed to be occurring in England, the traffic is on the right side of the street not the left, as it should be in a reflection. How could this have gone unnoticed? In America the lane of oncoming traffic is to the driver's left. In a mirror's reflection, it would appear to be on the right side. Drivers sit on the left side. In a mirror they would appear to be on the right side.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Story With A Lot of Potential (but still feels like a rough draft)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mirrors, like so many horror movies today, has a great premise: the world beyond reflections is, in fact, another world (seemingly inhabited by the spirits of the dead). Cool. Throw in a possessed child (who ends up being a possessed nun)scampering around a dark and dingy department store basement, and you would think that all the ingredients for a great horror tale are there - and they are! However, the story seems like a rehearsal, or a rough draft story that needs polishing. It was enjoyable and I recommend it to horror fans, but what is most frustrating is thinking that it could have been TRULY great. Three suggestions: Keep the story in the dark of the abandoned department store and its underworld. Focus on the tale of the possessed child/nun and let her inhabit the building in a Changeling/Exorcist manner. Lose the "my family is in danger" aspect and keep it simple: lone security guard in peril in the building (perhaps even keep the tale to one night). Okay who cares what I think, I know, but I just had to rant a bit. Now for the faults: why are they painting out the mirrors with green paint as if afterward they can clean them off? Anyone in real life would have taken them down and put them in the basement or something. Obviously a necessary gimmick to allow the entity to return later, only further revealing the rough draft quality of story-telling here. Further, we are never fully aware of why the "entity" in the mirrors so desperately wanted the little girl (nun) back. Also, the "kills" seem a bit gratuitous and simple - as if to keep the teens watching. Skip them - or give them more basis than "I am an angry demon". And FINALLY, I felt there was a lot of potential for atmospheric CREEP factor that was lost: skip the bloody introduction which reveals all; unveil the tale with patience...nothing is more frightening than the unseen or only alluded-to. I sat wishing that the beginning of the movie had been Sutherland's initial entrance in the creepy store...then spent the rest of the movie thinking how much better it could have been in general. Loved the final scene, however! It was a shocker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mirrors was OK. The only reason I rented this movie was because my girlfriend thought it looked good and i could remember previews for when it was in theaters and I wanted to see it once it refreshed my mind. It wasn't the scariest movie but it was more of a psychological standpoint. The only scene that is disturbing is at the beginning when the guy slits his own throat as well as the jaw scene. It was just creepy but in a good psychological thriller kind of way. At the end made you wonder if they were gonna make a second one. It made you "think" at the end. But, anyway it's a good movie that plays with your mind. What would happen if you looked into a mirror and the mirror looked back???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts out interesting, but logic takes a leap to the mirror world in the second half.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reader be warned: when a movie's trailers shows its only two good scenes, you're in for trouble.Mirrors follows the adventures of Ben Carson (Kiefer Sutherland, who unfortunately has forgotten how to act like anybody other than Jack Bauer), a down on his luck police officer with an estranged wife, an attractive younger sister, and the world's most dangerous job: guarding mirrors in a burnt-out department store from hooligans. All nice and normal...until he sees images in the mirrors that should not be there, and that follow him home. Trying to find out what is going on, Ben digs into the past of the department store, and what he finds turns his world upside down (or should that be in reverse? Mirror joke, there). He must then stop the horror before it consumes him and his family.Okay, SPOILERS AHEAD. Fairly warned be thee.The movie starts out creepily enough, and the two horrible deaths are very creative and cool looking, but without those scenes what we have left is the same old 'Ghost Story' in the lines of 'The Grudge,' 'The Ring,' and so on (that is, a PG-13 story with an R rating to lure in the unsuspecting). We have characters being menaced by a demonic force that originally possessed a little girl in the 1940s, that now apparently kills just because it feels like it, with no rhyme or reason. Which leads to the logic issues. Why would it possess the little girl it chooses in the first place? Why did it leap into the mirrors when it got the chance? Why does it kill very visibly and violently, when it could give the characters heart attacks and hide for years without detection? Why does it need the little girl, grown up after 60 years, to possess again, when it seems like half the other people in the movie would work just as well? Having this remain 'mysterious' is foolish: they are reasonable questions, and given the film has nearly two hours to answer them and doesn't isn't a good sign.And don't get me started about the ending scenes. I think this very well may be the first movie I've ever seen where a nun, who acts very sensibly and reasonably, gets coerced at gunpoint into fighting a demon, does so without complaint, and then when she is possessed, gets yelled at and beat up by Kiefer Sutherland.Yes, that's right: See Kiefer Sutherland set a nun on fire! If there weren't spoiler issues, I would have made that my summary right there. If that line made you shake your head, don't see the movie. If it made it you laugh, you might give the movie a glance. It's certainly not the worst movie of this genre, as long as you don't think too much about it. Just be assured it does NOT do for mirrors what Psycho did for showers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have just finished watching this film and I have to say, I was impressed with the effects....but disappointed with the overall storyline.For starters, I just can't imagine anyone staying for longer than five minutes in that job - when spooky things happened on the very first night of Ben (Keifer Sutherland) working there.... especially someone who is supposed to be in quite a delicate emotional state already.There are plenty of chilling moments in this film and that's my reason for the 6 out of 10 vote - the score would have been lower if it had just been for the story! The acting is very good - with everyone being as believable as possible, in such an unbelievable scenario. The action starts very early on in the film and doesn't let up all the way through. Never a dull moment, even when looking after a derelict building in the dead of night! The ending was "different" - which pleased my hubby very much (he loved the ending of The Mist, whereas I prefer a "happy" ending!). I would have preferred it to go on a little longer and for the ending to be nicer.I always judge a good scary film by whether or not I am frightened AFTER I've watched it (as with The Ring - I was really scared to get up and go to the bathroom in the night without putting on all the lights LOL). This one hasn't made me afraid to look in a mirror, or to be alone in a mirror filled house.... although I might be inclined to check that I haven't left my reflection behind when I next get in the bath!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The point of a horror film is to scare and slightly repulse you. Mirrors certainly achieves that. But i think for the wrong reasons. The story is paranormal, with the concept that reflections in the mirror can turn against you and harm you. I enjoyed it. Kind of. It was certainly an interesting idea: the whole mirrors turning against you thing, your reflection having a will of its own. But obviously, its er, not going to happen, is it? So therefore. Not scary. Really. In addition to this, Kiefer Sutherlands character is a bit of an idiot. A door opens in a mirror but not in real life? lets go check it out, shall we? And then you start seeing things in them; you know, the dead bodies, and that. You learn that the person with the same job before you DIED because of the mirrors. And you don't quit your job??However, I don't want to be a cynic. That is classic horror movie stuff, doing what you wouldn't do, going down the dark corridor, finding the hidden room of an insane asylum, etc. Films are films because of it. Im just trying to say that its not this that makes Mirrors scary. I think the mirrors thing would have tame, and basically rubbish, by itself. But then the film has scenes with such blood and gore and craziness that it really makes the actual mirrors scenario the least scary part: its the schizophrenic twelve year old scratching at the walls in her house that is scary as hell (although her demon older alter ego or whatever it is is ridiculous.)I think my problem is paranormal films. If you enjoy them, you'll enjoy this. I personally have always found films that have a base in truth and could actually happen scarier than those that are completely far-fetched. Plus, in England, its rated a 15, which i think is a bit low (considering the scariness of the 12 year old...if i was 15 and i'd seen it, I'd be avoiding my reflection for weeks!) Overall, a slightly above average horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so before seeing the movie I read a lot of previous IMDb reviews about it. Even though many described it as another ridiculous American horror remake I think it actually was a lot better than many of the other crap horror films we have today. The film didn't have me 'on the edge of my seat' at all, but it was interesting to watch. The actors performances were well acted and as most horror films do, they had many 'jumpy' moments with scary music and unexpected goings on. I would recommend you see this movie as the plot is interesting, and for any one who likes gore, one scene in the movie was made just for you. It was a good film, and much better than many of the films that are released today. It wasn't very scary, but the couple of jumpy moments keep the adrenaline pumping and so does the creepy character of the little boy. Even though the little boy 'Michael Carson' is not a main character, he was actually quite convincingly scary when playing the 'evil' reflection, as his eyes alone scared me. Overall, this movie was good, not brilliant but still did not deserve the amount of bad reviews it received from the critics. 7 stars out of 10.I'll never look at a mirror the same again.Kidding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A deeply unnerving film spoilt by a bad ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror films are falling back into decline, just like they were in the early 80's with trashy sequels to Halloween and Friday the 13th.2008 has been a decent year for good horror movies; The Strangers was excellent and Saw V is being released very soon. Mirrors seems to have been lost in the background between these two movies and never really got the recognition it deserved.An excellent start to the film is met by an equally good middle half, and only the final 20 minutes spoils the scene. Acting by all the leads is brilliant, especially from the children who really can send a chill down your spine. You'll see what I mean.Unfortunately, that bad ending really ruins the entire film for me, it turns into an action movie instead of ending at a point which would've made it the best horror film of the past few years.A few details make mirrors a good watch, but not a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On reflection - totally average</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror films are made for the cinema - everything about them is ten times scarier on the big screen so off I went to see Mirrors.Mirrors follows Ben (Kiefer Sutherland) a cop who is suspended from duty pending investigation over the accidental killing of an undercover detective. He gets a new job as a night watchman in a burnt out old department store and it is here he finds that the mirrors inside the department store are causing people to die.The possessed mirrors seemed to kill people at random. They killed the previous night watchman and went after Ben but left the day watchman alone. They only seemed to kill those who went into the department store (apart, of course from the day watchman) but then left the department store to terrorise Ben's family. They weren't exactly consistent in their plan to reek revenge on who ever looked in them.Anyway halfway through the movie Ben (and the audience) remember that he is in fact a cop so we get a few nice "detective" montage scenes. I don't see why police have problems solving crimes - they should just look at movie police. A 5 minute montage scene looking at old newspaper cuttings will solve any crime - no matter how ridiculous the crime or absurd the logic is.Ben's detective work leads us to learn that an asylum was previously where the department store stood and that a child who was a patient there may hold the key. Well the child from the 50's survived by becoming a nun. Anna survived not because the lord protected her of course, but rather because, mirrors were banned from the convent. I honestly would love to tell you what happened next but honest to God I do not actually know. Apparently the mirrors were killing people in there search for the girl that got away. Why were they searching for her in the first place? Why are mirrors killing people? How did all the madness start? Well none of those questions were answered and it doesn't matter as the final battle included Bens son drowning in the living room carpet (yes you did read that correctly) and Ben having a fist fight with a 90 year old possessed nun.As daft as the last 30mins got the movie was quite scary and the jumps were all very well placed.The department store was still filled with burnt out mannequins and with all the close-ups of them the anticipation of expecting one of them to move was the scariest part of the whole movie. In fact if the mannequins had of just come alive we would have got a much scarier and probably more plausible movie.It is a good scary one though. Once Ben heads for the convent though you should head for the exit door!!5/10 The standard scares are all good but nothing in the movie will stop you from looking in your bathroom mirror when you get home. Loses 5 points for the ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mirrors is a really good movie except for the fact that it could have been lot better and i think many people would agree i'll state here some points that i hated and liked about this moviepositive -Kiefer's performance was good although i never liked him -The idea .. for me its new and strong -The effects are fine , not too many gore scenes -The end , if it wasn't for that end i would have given that movie just 6/10negative -How they ended things so fast in the 2nd half of the movie like if they wanted to make the run time the minimum they could , as i think it would be better if they made some more scenes involving the mirrors instead of wrapping things that fast and rushing into the old repeated story of the sick little girl which i realized that most of the horror movies gets related to a little girl who was sick and held in a hospital -Not much tense throughout the movie , as usually Ben would spend few minutes in the dark place and then its sunlight which breaks the tense -A very clear mistake in a very interesting end (spoiler here) when Ben was trapped inside the mirrors world , they show us how Police and NYPD words on the cars were mirrored , as how would a mirror make the word which starts from the back side of the vehicle to it's front be written from the front to the end .. the mistake is silly but doesn't really change the fact that it was great way to end the movie and more interesting than just going back home and giving his wife and children a hugall in all the movie is good and recommended , 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was not in my list of movies. I would not have gone to see it, but my friends persuaded me and I agreed to join them.An ex-cop Ben Carson (Kiefer Sutherland) takes a night job at a burned out departmental store in New York. Soon he knows that the mirrors in the department store are communicating, and want him to find a person named ESSEKER otherwise Ben s family is in danger. Ben finds ESSEKER and ends the mystery, but looses himself as being one of the mirror spirits.Young writer ? director Alexandre Aja, ventures into horror stuff. Personally I found the whole movie to be full of clichéd, the characters, the family, the sets, the dialogues, the screenplay, the events, the ending, the suspense ? everything? Kiefer Sutherland acted well, but at times over-did his role a bit. Paula Patton in the wife role was so so? This is a Twentieth Century Fox and Regency production. As a child when I used to hear the starting music of the Twentieth century banner, it gave a sign of branding and surety that we are watching that wont be something run of a mill but would be of a very good quality.After seeing this movie, I have to say that the standards of Twentieth Century has fallen despite fierce competition. How can one invest money in such cheesy script and screenplay? Even wanting to get scared - I did not get scared even once throughout the movie, but got annoyed by the sudden loud jarring sounds ? that were used to scare the audience.There were surely few pluses ? the beginning titles shots of New York skyline and its mirroring effect, the last shot of New York skyline and the whole scene when Ben's sister ? tears open her own jaw.. I thought that was a fantastic scene! Overall ? not a great movie for me.(Stars 3.75 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dr. Morris: "When one starts to perceive one's own reflection as a completely separate being, one is suddenly confronted with two entirely separate egos, two entirely separate worlds that can strip us at any given moment. Feeling of self-hatred, usually triggered by a psychological shock, can split the personality in two, hence creating two or more personalities with distinct memories with distinct behavior patterns within the same individual. The patient then has the false perception of the existence of two distinct worlds. The real world, and the world inside a mirror."Kiefer Sutherland stars as an NYPD detective-turned-security guard who discovers something sinister lurking in the mirrors of a fire-damaged department store in Haute Tension writer/director Alexandre Aja's menacing study in the origins of evil. It's been just about a year since mercurial police detective Ben Carson (Sutherland) was suspended from the NYPD for the fatal shooting of an undercover officer, and ever since that fateful day he's been locked in a self-destructive spiral of anger and alcoholism. Increasingly isolated from his wife and kids, Ben spends most nights crashed-out at his sister Angela's (Amy Smart) apartment in Queens. But Ben hasn't given up hope just yet, and in order to get his life back together and prove that he's still capable of supporting his family he takes a job as the night watchman at the Mayflower department store. The Mayflower used to be a lavish symbol of inner-city prosperity, that is, until a raging inferno gutted the building while claiming numerous lives in the process. These days, the Mayflower is a scorched reminder of human misery, the ornate mirrors therein reflecting a suffering so profound that it begins to wear on Ben's already-fragile psyche. Not only that, but whatever force dwells behind the shimmering glass seems to have gained the power to alter reality as well.After Ben gazes into the mirrors and sees a vision of himself being relentlessly tortured, he is horrified to experience violent convulsions, spontaneous bleeding, and frightening asphyxiation. And while his sister is always willing to lend a sympathetic ear, she chalks the anomalies up to an unusually potent mix of stress and anxiety. Unfortunately for Ben, his estranged wife, Amy (Paula Patton), isn't nearly as forgiving. A prosaic NYPD medical examiner who has seen her fair share of tragedy, Amy fears that Ben's erratic behavior could be placing their children in danger. Later, as Ben begins to draw connections between his increasingly gruesome visions and a former Mayflower security guard who vanished without a trace, he begins to suspect that an unimaginable evil is using the mirrors as a gateway into the real world, and that his family is in mortal danger from forces beyond their realm of understanding. Perhaps if he Ben can manage to convince Amy that their children's lives are at risk, he can summon the courage to face the greatest evil he has ever known.I'm in a pickle in this one. A part of me says that I really liked it and I was scared enough to like it but a part of me also says it sucked, the second act dragged the movie down and the demon battle scene in the end was totally unnecessary and hilarious at the same time. To be honest, that bit was a turn-off, it was going so well then the old lady with flying ninja skills had to pop up and battle Jack Bauer. But at least, the surprising (for lack of a better word) ending was a shocker and a pretty decent conclusion to end it all.Alexandre Aja, the director of The Hills Have Eyes remake and High Tension, delivers all the goods in the first act, the second act kind of slows down losing the spooky vibe and becoming more of a monster movie but tops it off with a pretty decent ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kiefer Sutherland, the actor has come a long way since Max Dugan returns. I have watched his many performances and realized that like his father, this thespian is quite talented. In this black horror story, he plays Ben Carson, a former NYPD policeman who has been suspended due to a shooting. Now awaiting a final judgment, he takes a Night watchman's security job. His duties are routine, so much so his main concern is boredom, an alcohol addiction which he is fighting and some powerful sedatives. A few days on the job guarding an old abandoned department store which has been burned to the ground, Ben encounters some frightening noises, odd happenings and some ghostly apparitions. Dismissing them as hallucinations due to his medications, he continues his rounds only to learn that the ghostly images are become stronger and much more deadly, to include his own family. The movie itself is familiar to one I believe I'v seen before. Still, Mr. Sutherland gives a plausible and convincing performance. The scenes are a good indication of his versatility and one would not be adverse to believe that this movie will become a milestone for him. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the film "Mirrors" is supposed to be based on, but the end result is simply awful. The plot lacks any consistency whatsoever. It's literally just one plot device after the other, making the film entirely pointless and boring to watch. Most of the ideas seem to come from a bunch of 15-year-olds smoking pot at their parent' attic and trying to come up with something similar to "Poltergeist" or "The Ring" but failing at it in every possible way. I rarely felt so ripped off as I felt after watching "Mirrors". If you like to see a film that tries to include all the clichés of famous horror films and fails miserably, try "Mirrors". Otherwise, try a better film.</fullReview>

This movie is totally terrible.Only redeeming value: A half naked Amy Smart. This movie is absolutely terrible.

		<shortDescription>Middling, distracting horror fare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning New York cop Ben Carson (Kiefer Sutherland) quit the force after an undercover assignment went tragically wrong. He takes a job as a night watch man on the reconstruction site of a burned down department store to get by. However, one thing he notes is the really large mirrors there- and from then on, whenever he looks in the mirror, it's as if some sinister force has taken hold of his life and he's driven to desperate lengths to find out why and to stop it.Kiefer Sutherland spent years in the acting wilderness, but spent the best part of the noughties developing an iconic figure of his own in the shape of Agent Jack Bauer with the hit TV show 24. Still a hit series today, the man has enough clout to get a lead role in a big studio production like Mirrors. But by choosing projects as piecemeal as this, his star may continue to shine brightest on TV.The DVD of the film offers the theatrical version or the far gorier 18 rated uncut version, which I, always preferring the fuller picture, chose to watch. Outrageous and gratuitous gore, though, will only perk things up for the most shallow viewers. The clunky script and hollow dialogue are like sketching paper for the formulaic, by the numbers film Mirrors is. It's not predictable and there is some strong mystery behind the curse of the mirrors, but the revelation at the end is just ridiculous and baffling and there is no genuine feeling of tension or suspense through any of it. Even more unintentionally funny are Sutherland's sister's death and the 'spooky' bit where he redundantly fires bullets at the mirrors which show no damage. The film pretentiously and presumptuously tries to round itself off with a Sixth Sense style, profound ending which turns the story on it's head but the effect is too transparent to make any impact.Not an awful little horror film at all, just an unremarkable and preposterous one, best served for an in flight movie on a red eye flight home. **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It all makes sense if you look at it as a video game being played.Kiefer Sutherland's performance is a mix between the character and the frustrated player. When he tries to solve a problem he slowly works up to anger which usually ends in him using his gun as it is the most prominent tool at his disposal. As the film progresses we see the player become sick with the plot and begins handling things from a sheer statistical point of view to finish the game. This is evident around the part in the convent as he rushes through every conversation and uses his anger and violence to achieve the objective he set out to do in the storyline.Another tell is the special effects. Some are good while others seemed rushed. The makeup for the mirror monsters is good as are the mirror special effects. There are a couple of over the top death scenes that really don't fit in with the subtlety of most mirror monster films. Then there is the fire which looks like it is a sprite graphic from a PS2 era game.All in all was an entertaining film that I would recommend to anyone who wants to laugh and still have a few good scares.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film of two halves.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mirrors is set in New York where ex cop Ben Carson (executive producer Kiefer Sutherland) has to take a job as a nighttime security guard at the old burned down department store ruins called the Mayflower to support himself &amp; his estranged wife &amp; kids. While patrolling the Mayflower ruins Carson starts seeing things in the mirrors which aren't really there, he sees himself on fire &amp; other people badly burned screaming for help. Carson comes to believe that the mirrors inside the Mayflower store are possessed by evil spirits that want him to find someone called Esseker, Carson calls a few favors in on the force &amp; learns Esseker was a young patient at the psychiatric hospital where the Mayflower store now stands, a hospital with a dark past &amp; an equally dark future unless Carson can find a way to break the curse &amp; free the spirits...Worked on under the title Into the Mirror this American Romanian co-production was co-written &amp; directed by Axelandre Aja for all intents &amp; purposes Mirros is a remake of the South Korean supernatural horror film Into the Mirror &amp; is one in a long line of American remakes of Asian horror films along with the likes of The Ring (2002), The Grudge (2004), Dark Water (2005), Pulse (2006), The Eye (2008) &amp; One Missed Call (2008) all of which have been of variable quality. Mirrors as it stands falls somewhere in the middle, while not a total waste of time it really isn't that great or satisfying a film. Mirrors does start off quite nicely with a cool kill scene &amp; the introduction of Sutherland's character, this opening half is when the films at it's best with a nice mood &amp; atmosphere while the story is also still intriguing at this point too. Unfortunately once all the nonsense about the psychiatric hospital kicks in director Aja forgets all about the horror aspects &amp; Mirrors becomes some sort of silly supernatural thriller with Carson kidnapping a nun in Pennsylvania at gunpoint to try &amp; save his family. The story is never really explained, there's not enough meat on the bones as it's something to do with schizophrenia &amp; these demons trapped in the mirrors want to get out &amp; once they do we are treated to the extremely silly sight of some old zombie witch thing &amp; Sutherland fighting it out in some tunnels, there's no rhyme or reason to it &amp; the ending is just a bit embarrassing although I will the final few minutes do offer up a pretty cool twist ending that almost saves it. Too many things are left unanswered, like how did that earlier security know to send those newspaper clippings to Carson? Why did he send them? The rules are never really defined, it's stated that the images in the mirror can make you do things but then that annoying kid Michael is sucked into the floor &amp; it just feels like the rules of the film change at a whim. Also at over 100 minutes long it does drag especially when all the scares &amp; tension is abandoned for silly explanations &amp; exposition.I watched this on Blu-ray last night &amp; selected the 'Extended Cut' which apparently contains a bit more gore, the real gory scenes are the initial throat slashing, someones pulls their own jaw off &amp; there's a couple of scenes set inside a morgue where some bodies can be seen. When Sutherland is being spooked by what he sees in the mirrors early in the film Mirrors is quite creepy &amp; rather effective &amp; it's a shame what the film turns into later on. French director Aja likes his remakes as his first US film was The Hills Have Eyes (2006) remake, his second was this remake &amp; his third is set to be Piranha 3-D (2010) which is a remake of Joe Dante's classic killer fish flick Piranha (1978).With a supposed budget of about $35,000,000 this had a lukewarm reception at the box-office both commercially &amp; critically which is understandable,although set in New York this was partly filmed in Romania. The film looks good with nice production values &amp; decent enough effects work. The acting is alright, Sutherland is always watchable although his two kids &amp; ex wife are awful &amp; irritated me.Mirrors isn't a total waste but doesn't build on it's creepy first half as it should &amp; that ending fight between Sutherland &amp; that witch is just ridiculous. Could have been better.</fullReview>

In this mirror USA movie you just don't understand the "reason" why things happen or not quite good. If you want to see the better and best version of it go see Geoul sokeuro it's about the same story just "the reason" is clearly and make sense. To be honest I didn't know it would be a rip off so when I saw this mirror movie I just was disgust that the American made another ripoff from and excellent movie! Of course this version has a lot of special effect. So if you just watch movie to see special effect but with no senses, then you'll like it, but if you want a good story and a to feel real horror watch the "real" version.So don't waste your time with this....and watch Geoul sokeuro!!</fullReview>

Not only does he want his job back, but the now alcoholic also wants his family back. Sleeping on his sister's couch and desperate for a job, Ben takes a routine job as a night watchman of the burned and crumbling ruins of the Mayflower department store, once a majestic and famous icon. The building is massive and as Ben patrols the eerie confines it is hard not to notice the ornate mirrors that stand intact on the walls. With flashlight in hand, Carson will witness terrifying images of a gruesome past. He will become obsessed with trying to unravel the secrets of the mansion-like Mayflower's past. Not only his life, but his family's future is placed in jeopardy.Alexandre Aja directs and co-writes this suspense filled thriller. MIRRORS contains very strong violence and disturbingly bizarre images. Also in the cast: Paula Patton, Cameron Boyce, Mary Beth Peil and Amy Smart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plot that makes sense? Who needs 'em?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember growing up as a kid watching movies, and pretty much all of them had a story that made sense. The good ole classic horror movies like Nightmare on Elm Street, they had the protagonist, they had the meat to kill but even stranger (by today's standards it seems) the story behind the killer was told.Not so in Mirrors. You got mirrors that kill. They got no rules, they just jump from house to house, follow around families and kill them in various ways. About half way through, you find that its not about Mirrors in fact...but reflections. Death can come in many forms, whether it be the reflection on the mirror, door knob or water. So really, this movie should have been called: Reflections!Alas, why they do it? Maybe its meant to be a mystery? Kiefer should really have given it up in the 90's. His whiny character has supposedly killed someone - again story not really told - hes all beat up and can't go back to work. His wife walks all over him and dosn't give him the time of day. It is pretty much at this point, where Kiefer begs and whines to his wifey to see his kids, that you consider turning it off...but it's one of those flicks where you just want to see how bad it gets.Hoping that the ending would shed some light on 'why' the mirrors killed, I fast forwarded through some strange scene where a nun turns into a demon, but unfortunately came up trumps.If you want to redeem Kiefer, then maybe have a look The Lost Boys, although after Mirrors - that will be a very hard task indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the start of this film you get shocks and scares. It is unusual for a terror to scare you from the first 5mins and usually ends in a rubbish spoilt film, but with Mirros it really works. Mirros keeps you on the edge of your seat right to the last second of the film and does a brilliant job at it, shame about the advertising for the film as i feel they could have made more of a box office hit from better media coverage, but the film itself is brilliant, a must watch for anyone that loves a good horror that keeps you scared after you leave the cinema, you will not want to look in your bathroom mirror ever again! Voted 10 out of 10 for the film but i would suggest they had better advertising!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a lot more than i expected at first. the same week i'd seen midnight meat train (not so good movie) I went to explore the movie mirrors.When people are walking out in a horror movie cause the movie is that terrifying you know it's a good one!It's not that u could see just blood and limbs the whole time.. It was more like a thriller building up the tension and made you scare the hell out of yourself at some points. I've seen a lot of horror movies.. but this one even got me some times on the tip of my chair screaming out..wtf!?! omg!! The movie just rocks and the bathroom scene... i will never forget it! brilliant.So if you want to see a scary movie go see mirrors! Way better than a saw 4 of a midnight meat train.I really like the movie a lot :D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great atmospheric horror film with nicely and wisely used gore(GORE!GORE!GORE!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't make the most common mistake and rate this film comparing it with the original.....I will rate this film though as a remake!!!It delivers and that's the bottom line...In my opinion is probably one of the best horror films of the last 10 years!!!Very nice atmosphere,very nice occasional gore(GORE!GORE!GORE!),very nice acting by Kiefer and very nice story(for this the credit goes to the original of course) and what a great ending!!!Now about the bad acting of the kids...hmmmm...well it didn't bother me at all!Of course I wouldn't give them an Oscar but their roles were secondary anyway and don't tell me that near the end the little guy,even with his ''bad acting'',wasn't creepy!?!?!I would also like to say that there always gonna be a discussion about the Hollywood remakes of Asian horror movies,but I don't think that's wise!!!The original is and always will be the original!!!BUT if the remake is decent,it gives a great push of the original's plot to an even larger audience!!!I'm from Greece and here we don't use dubbing!!! Strictly subtitles and I think that's the best way to enjoy a movie in its original form!!!But I also know that in the rest of the world especially in America,people are not really into the subs thing!!!So even though I disagree with that,I also look at it realistically and respect that!!!So if I'm about to learn a great story a little bit changed from its original form,I prefer that instead of not learn the story at all!!!Sure the best thing is the original but it's always interesting to see (if it's nicely done of course!!!)the same story from a different point of view,let's say...Finally I would like to remind you the most important thing of all...Let's not hide behind our fingers...We are horror fans,crazy,loud and proud about it!!!So this means that if we watch a nice American''re''made horror movie and we like it,of course we're gonna look for the original movie also!!!!So....no worries,life is beautiful... Enough said...ENJOY THE F*****G FILM!!!!It rocks!!! 9,5 / 1 0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mirrors are standard fare for horror junkies, such as myself. I think that most little kids have some sort of 'thing' with them. After all, who hasn't stood in front of a mirror, with the lights out, and whispered "bloody Mary, bloody Mary...""? And who hasn't scampered away before the completion? I know for sure that I have, and so have most of my friends. And I can't count the number of truly creepy horror movies that utilize mirrors to one extent or another.The reason is apparent. To a creative mind, mirrors are more than just glass. They are where you see the one person you cannot see: Yourself. They are purveyors of perception. They are doorways to alternate realities, as far back as Lewis Carroll, or further."Mirrors" contains many of the creepy elements that make mirrors scary. My favorite nightmare (and a recurring one from age 6 to age 12) was when I would look in a mirror and I would move and my reflection would not. I told this to the barrista at Arclight, before I went into the theatre and he smiled knowingly. OK. So, I guess I'll be having nightmares tonight! But there is enough gore and ick-factor, to keep the film from being so menacing that I slept with the lights on. (Paradoxically, bloody junk usually lightens this type of film.)And, on top of it, Keifer Sutherland brings in enough Jack Bauer to give me the 24 fix I've been craving! How can I have terrible nightmares when Jack's around?? The film most certainly does have a lot of nightmarish elements, though, and the back story is well-played, if a bit cliché. Additionally, much of the film work is lovely, drawing the viewer's attention where it needs to be, without using a cattle-prod.All said, I liked the film and did not have nightmares... but I did wake up in the middle of the night and refuse to leave my husband's side, just in case the mirror in the bathroom was holding a grudge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All over the world, there are stories and legends regarding mirrors. In some cultures, when a person dies, all the mirrors are covered so the spirit does not become trapped inside. Every culture has it's own version of the mirror visage Bloody Mary. It's also said that mirrors can reveal your true self, if you look hard enough.Forget all that when going into this movie. It has jack to do with it. If you don't like mild nudity and language, some blood and gore, violence and terrifying moments(ha-more like terrifying sequences) this movie is definitely not for you.This is what happens when Saw meets The Ring meets The Eye meets Pulse.That's all.I enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little old school, a little modern, though not entirely complete...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Carson (Keifer Sutherland) is currently undergoing marital problems with his wife, Amy (Paula Patton), who is not showing much interest in his wellbeing. As an attempt to stabilize his life, Ben lands a job as a nighttime security guard for an abandoned, yet important, department store. However Ben comes across some mysterious circumstances when it appears that the mirrors in the building are reflecting an alternative reality to his own.The story seems like a simple affair at first: man goes around some dark and mysterious place, discovers something he shouldn't, and all hell breaks loose. For the sakes of everyone, the film does attempt to be more then that. Director Alexandre Aja does a good job at meshing both the supernatural elements of the mirrors with the reality of Carson's married life. The former is tense with some some great moments marred by some which are clichéd. The overall result is hardly mixed however, and proves to serve horror in a good dose, and as well has a nice hint of Asian horror. Like the horror, the social elements either work or do not. The conflict between both Ben and Amy seems rooted in reality and can be related to. But the film does little in the beginning arc to help attach the viewer to Ben's social life circumstances and so there are a few scenes which don't quite gel well enough to be entirely believable. The overall story moves at a decent enough pace, slowly bringing to light new point for the viewer. But after the two-thirds mark, the story not only picks up speed but content as well to the point where the last third of the film has enough story to be told in the first two-thirds. The problem is that too much happens towards the end that its difficult to justify cohesion in the films plot. It really needed to be a few minutes longer so that some of the plot could get more fleshing out.But what is presented, Aja does a great job directing. The cinematography is not exceptional by any means, but is still a wonder to watch. The best of the lot easily goes to the death sequences, with the first being an excellent prologue into the story, and another which is truly numbingly evil: you'll want to keep watching due to its uniqueness but at the same time turn your eyes away. Sadly not all scenes are well thought through, mainly due to the story. The ending, for instance, was rather surprising but apt. However there is no underlying logic to link the events to any tangible truth expressed through Aja's direction. And this is easily the films greatest fault: Aja appears to hope the audience will not question how the film progresses. Even the explanation for the mirrors is still left shrouded, and not because its all expected to be a big mystery, but because Aja does little to use his directional cue to help give more explanation when its needed.Acting is commendable with a few solid performances but none of them are truly able to be anything but good. Sutherland pulls the film along and is fairly believable throughout as a confused security guard going through marital problems, while having to cope with the mystery that surrounds the mirrors. The only downside is that his performance does, at times, bear a slight resemblance to his role in 24. It's nothing major, and will perhaps only be available to ardent fans of the series. Other characters are minor, though Patton does get a nice little chunk and is adequate enough to support Sutherland, but when the script seems to falter with her character, so does Patton. Thankfully her acting is not unbearable.No sex, and some slight nudity, the film is loaded with scattered with swearing, though not always hard. The violence does get gory with two particular scenes, shown in the red-band trailer, being excessively so. And the camera lingers on the bodily wounds and accompanied blood. Beyond this there is nothing exceedingly graphics about the scenes, with the worst being the images of people on fire but this is achieved with poor CG and so lessens its effect. In fact, fans of Aja's work will possibly be a tad disappointed that the gore level never reaches his previous efforts, notably The Hills Have Eyes, but that doesn't stop it from being powerful images nonetheless.Mirrors is very much like a mirror in all honesty. There is the real, tangible film, but then also the diluted image which is created from the reflection: as much as the film seems to promote substance, it inadvertently at times does not. The story is interesting, though inconsistent. The acting is good, though not entirely exclusive. The horror has some excellent moments, though there probably is not enough. Regardless, Mirrors is not a poor excuse for a film. On the contrary, its a good attempt and quite enjoyable. If anything, Mirrors proves an excellent introduction for those who have not accustomed themselves, or are not willing to do so, to the excessive gore of modern horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spookiest and goriest in years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that I value all opinions about this movie. But speaking strictly from someone that hasn't been into the 24 series show, I must say that in my opinion that this is the most spookiest and on the edge of your seat movie that has come in years. There where a few times that the movie appeared a little to dark and somewhat cliché. But I must honestly say that I have enjoyed all of Kiefers work all the way back to lost boys. To sum up this movie, The gore was incredible that pushed that old envelope. The acting wasn't to bad and the creepiness of the movie kept you on the edge of your seat. I mean just imagine of the possibility of and alternate reality just behind the mirror we take for granted everyday, that alone is spooky enough. And to everyone's question about the ending. Sutherland's character ended up on that other side of the mirror, the side that he thought was always looking back. But this is just all my opinion. Thanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great MovieAfter reading some of the other less-than-enthusiastic user reviews I have to say that I only slightly agree with some of their conclusions. Sure, there were some "so-so" moments, and holes in the storyline, but on a whole I thought this was an A-Class horror/thriller ? one of the best I've ever seen. After all, it's just a movie. Thus, I tend to base my judgments on how well it keeps my attention, how they effect me, and not by what I would have done differently. And, by how many times it makes my wife jump. She reports having been startled at least 10 times and it never lost my attention. That's pretty darn good. The look of this movie is creepy and often disturbing ? sort of Silent Hillish ? which, along with The Ring, seems to have become the norm for horror movies. I loved the look, feel, and creepiness of the massive burned-out department store and thought it was very well done. Overall, the movie seemed like a combination of The Ring, Silent Hill, The Frighteners, and The Boogyman. In fact, the film's opening sequence in the subway could have come right out of the video game Silent Hill 3. The main character played by Kiefer Sutherland, is an ex-cop named Ben who is waiting to be reinstated after killing someone in the line of duty, and is just all screwed up emotionally and every-other way. Sutherland does an excellent job ? as always. A good supporting cast made this film even better. I would swear even Jack from the series 24 made an appearance or two. But while the first half or ? of the movie is genuinely terrifying, some of the rest becomes somewhat standard stuff. This is a small criticism since I enjoyed the entire film; but once Sutherland hooks up with the old nun the movie seems to take on a, "well, let's get this over with" feel. But all is forgiven with what can only be described as a great ending which left it wide open for a sequel ? or not. There are fantastically creepy atmospherically theatrical elements throughout that were definitely intended for the big screen, especially inside the massive burned out store. But the main strength of the movie is when Ben explores, and eventually witnesses, insanely disturbing and creepy events inside of the store. There are plenty of charred mannequins which seemed to follow Ben's every move, but the creepiest events are mainly associated with large mirrors. Reflections of seemingly innocent victims, which I figured represented supernatural replays of customers caught in the fire, are seen burning alive; grotesque people lying on the floors covered in burns and bloody wounds were crying for help, and distant disembodied screams, sent genuine chills of pending dread up my spine. Of course, all of this happens while Ben's working the night shift in the dark with only the aid of a flashlight. The large movie theater screen effect makes these scenes unbelievably striking. If it's not seen in the theater, I'd definitely urge it be viewed on as large a big screen as possible. My 65-inch screen might be the smallest able to adequately reflect the massive creepy atmosphere of the department store effectively ? that, of course, is just my opinion. But, there is so much detail to be missed on smaller screens. I'd also recommend at the least a home theater 5.1 surround system ? but again, that's just me. In all, I give this film a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a BAD movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Carson is a washed-up depressed ex-investigator whose self-proclaimed mistake led to the death of a fellow partner. With his marriage broken up and living with his sister, he attempts to get back on his feet by taking a job as a night watchman for an old, decrepit building burned up some time ago. It doesn't take him long to realize that something is very wrong with the absurd amount of mirrors lying polished about the ashy site.The movie gets off to an average start - it's nowhere near as impressive as, say, the Sixth Sense, but it's not something that makes you want to walk out. The movie progresses in a fair fashion; the mysterious mirrors play well, with no extremely cheesy special effects. For those who know about superstitions involving mirrors, it's quite interesting and fun to ponder what's really going on.You feel sorry for Ben Carson, although you're more interested in the mirrors. His wife was an average actor; some was rather misplaced, such as appropriate tone of voice and reactions. Some parts of the story, particularly having to do with Ben's shooting accident, falls a little behind and never really pops up in any true significant value; perhaps it should have been left out completely.The only part where the movie truly falls flat is when the mystery of the mirrors is revealed in a really bare-bones kind of fashion, although at the same time you're thinking, "well, what else?" Those who have seen this movie and rate it poorly on the basis of the mystery unveiled were expecting way too much out of a horror movie - still, the movie could have done better, and thankfully, the mystery can be ignored because the movie overall was not that bad.It is true that Mirrors wasn't fantastic, but neither was it bad. It deserves a higher rating than what is so far has, like Lady in the Water, which was much better than what people had to say about it. Simply sit back, relax, and grin as you see what becomes of Ben Carson and the wrathful mirrors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mirrors is a typical remake of a Korean movie -of course-. A lot of good thinks between a lot of usually known things. B-movie in A-quality. The scary parts are frightened enough, only the well known story is a little bit boring again. Kiefer Sutherland plays well the typical ex-cop alcoholic, divorced father. But I think we saw a lat of these characters on screen in the last 20 years. The mood is still good, so thats why I try to say: Watch it! There is a really good moment in the middle of the movie...in a bathroom!!! Alex Aja is a good horror director, but I think he should proof us something new too. Maybe a really movie with actors like Sutherland in a different story. Hope so, it will happen!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>despite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the lack of Japanese names in the credits, after only 5 minutes of viewing I was positive that Mirrors was just another film to be added to the ever increasing list of remakes being released in the United States today. It wasn't until later that I discovered it is South Korean, not Japanese. The plot is similar to every Japanese film being remade in the U.S. today: ghosts that can only be seen by, or come after the living through, videos, cameras, reflections, or static. Despite the let-down of viewing another remake, I was still excited about the prospect of another Alexandre Aja film. Mirrors is well done by both the actors and the director. The closed-down mall, though over the top, sets a great atmosphere. The body count is surprisingly low, but there is still enough gore to make you squirm in your seat, with the first death being both bloody and mundane, and the second being so unique it is painful to watch. The ending twist will not blow your mind, but it is portrayed well, linking together earlier imagery. Despite being another remake, the actors and director help set the film slightly above the avalanche of cloned films out there right now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Summer 2008 Movie Considering the Options</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kiefer Sutherland plays Ben Carson, a police detective who is kicked off the force for killing another officer. Now he is forced to live with his little sister Angela (Amy Smart) and work as a night watchman for a burned down department store, the Mayflower. While there, he stumbles upon an evil force that resides in the mirrors and will stop at nothing to hurt him and his family.I would love to compare this to the original Korean version, but I can't as I haven't seen it. Thus, I must enter into this assuming the story is for the most part original, even though I suspect it's not. It was an awkward film for Alexandre Aja, who thrilled us with "High Tension" and brought new life to "Hills Have Eyes". Aja works well with blood and guts and raw intensity, but it seems that trying to work with dialog and family situations is his weakness: line after line in this movie seemed cheesy or forced. The son, in particular, was a very poor actor.Luckily, Aja has some gore moments. We start with a throat-slitting scene. There's a very bloody scene with Amy Smart, a scene that probably is the highlight of the film. There's a few other jumps and scares... with some CG fire thrown in. Not necessary to be CG, but not as annoying as it could have been. More gore and action would have helped this picture, which drags a bit and plays to Aja's weakness. And the plot gets a bit weaker as it unravels, with the "secrets" of the mirrors not being all that interesting for me.I'm always happy to see Amy Smart, and for those who like skin you'll get some here. (Personally I think she looks better with clothes on, but I'm weird.) And Kiefer Sutherland, who probably hasn't done horror since "The Lost Boys" (unless you count "Dark City"), was as likable as ever. Playing an ex-cop might have been a bit close to his role as Jack Bauer on "24", but I think that's what many people want. (I have never seen "24".) If you see only one horror movie in theaters this summer, I guess "Mirrors" is a worthy choice. It's pretty much this one or "Midnight Meat Train", which also had its flaws. Maybe see both and together they'd be equal to one good film. In short, "Mirrors" has a lot of potential and some good scenes, but is largely easy to pass up and the weakest spot on Aja's (short) filmography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I am not a fan of grotesque films, I can accept the fact that some people might enjoy them if they are well made or compelling and persuasive. This film is very gross, and in addition it is illogical and suffers from inconsistent and irrational motivations, actions and events. It's not dumb enough to be funny, but rather is a pastiche of gross and bizarre events, some of which are cliché. If you pay attention to only a few minutes at a time, it feels like it's going somewhere and is reminiscent of various other bizarre horror films, but of you can bear to watch for an extended period and listen to the meaning claptrap uttered by the people in the film you quickly realize that the film doesn't hang together well.Some viewers seem to find the premise spooky and impressive because reflections are so commonplace (and hence scary??). They should be waiting with anxious anticipation for the sequel "DUST" which will contemplate another commonplace material gone awry.</fullReview>

Stupid ideas on how to fight the daemon from the mirror. And one of the idiotic things was the movement of the daemon itself when it possessed the girl again. Screenplay of the actors was average. It was too dark in some places. At some points, in the ending especially, resembled a lot "resident evil".The ending sucked - unfinished as most movies lately with a possibility to make "Mirrors 2".Thats about it If you like to see some gore its your movie.</fullReview>

As a cop he should know that facts can tell a story way better than erratic behavior and mumbling. Guess for which he goes when he is around people.Next time instead of building a story around a moron, use an intelligent character, it create a way better story. Tons of TV shows and movies are based on morons as heroes because the plots are for retarded viewers. I guess they target the lowest common denominator. I wish Americans would put more money on a good education system so that in a near future the lowest common denominator would reach higher standards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I see that this movie was very well produced, all the elements were up-to expectations and sometimes more, tense was always there along the movie, I really wanted to take a breath among all that fast events and continuous suspense. there was a message to those who don't care about the human being represented by psychiatric who treat a schizophrenic girl by mirrors, that was the seed of the movie. The life of Kiefer(the security guard in a burned mega mall) was a mess. he got fired from the police, divorced and in trouble with his lovely wife and his two kids, stays at his sister's apartment and on regular use of anti-depressant drug. On his rounds at his new job he discovers something odd. A hand print on a mirror. The print can't be removed. It's on the other side of the mirror. He also discovers a flooded basement. Back at home he starts seeing things in the mirror. And starts investigating things about the place and the security guard who he replaced. He suspects that it is not just in his head as others tell him but that something is not right with this building and the mirrors. this curse has passed to his family members, threatening them and this was the motive that he should end this curse otherwise he'll loose his family. the remaining deserves that you watch it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SCARY.........how F***ING bad movies are these days.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to this movie the other night expecting a fairly suspenseful horror movie that would scare me a little. Unfortunately what I got was crappy acting, a lame story, and nothing to be scared of. The premise is fairly good: evil mirrors that can make you do things that are, well, evil. Somewhere though it turns into a cross between The Exorcist and Flat Liners (a terrible movie also starring Keifer). To make it worse, the dialogue between the characters is utterly ridiculous. I don't know who finds this movie scary (there seems to be a lot though according to the other reviews) but I found myself either laughing (not in a good way) or saying "What the f---k is that crap?" or "Who comes up with this nonsense?" If you go to see this POS, don't say I didn't warn you. And, if you find it scary then you are probably afraid of your own shadow and/or reflection......(a bit of a pun what with the movie being called Mirrors and all, sorry)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i went into the theatre thinking it was going to be a good decent horror.trailers of the film had looked good. BUT it was so pathetic, the wholething. the beginning was good, but after half and hour of watching it, i got extremely bored of this. It was ludicrous, unbelievable and wasn't even scary at all. If you want to be scared, rather than see this movie, pull funny faces in a mirror instead. To be honest, i was laughing at film and keifer sunderland, not because it was funny, because it was utter rubbish. at one point, i very nearly walked out of the theatre. The ending was nonsense and i walked away from the cinema in utter disbelief how a good horror maker, Alexander ajar could make the hills have eyes remake really good n this so pointless and rubbish. Normally, i don't comment on movies on here, unless they are excellent or rubbish. Please don't bother watching it. you won't like it too- have written this review to stop people watching this film. I felt that i had totally wasted my time n money on it. I don't know if u can give a film less than 1 star, but i won't even give it one star- it is utter garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mirrors can be dangerous. They can hold all kind of surprises. A reflection may be more than just a reflection, so respect the mirror. This movie is great. What a surprise! Easily Keifer Sutherland's best movie. Don't be fooled by the B movie aspect of the story. The script is solid, and although meant to be one of those scary movies, the movie is actually solidly part of the sci-fi genre, presenting a complex story that challenges our conventional conception of one of our most common household items, mirrors. After watching this movie, you will come away with a far greater respect for mirrors, what they are for and more importantly, what they contain because your reflection may be something more than what you expect. So please, don't take your mirrors for granted and if you find something strange with your reflection, it may be due to causes that defy reasonable explanation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was A lot better than some are saying here. Whoever said that they laughed through it, have no idea of what they are saying! This was a great movie, I gave it a 9 out of 10. And no I am in NO WAY affiliated with the movie. I'm a movie (horror) fanatic. I've seen most of them and this ranks right up there with some of my favs. There were some legitimate jumps and scares. Which doesn't happen with some of the new stuff coming out. This was original, fresh and had a good plot and great acting. I'ts not a remake of anything I've ever seen or heard of and that gets extra points from me. This is NOT one to take the smaller kiddies to see. There is brief nudity, Amy Smart shows her butt getting into the tub, some foul language and a lot of blood and gore. I'd take my daughter to see it and she's 14 so that's about my cut-off age. Maybe 13 if your kids like to be scared. Would I see it again? Without a doubt. This is one I didn't mind paying to see. That's been hard to say the past couple years. Would be a good date movie if you like your lady snuggled up tight next to you. All in all I'd rate it a must see if you're a horror fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>reflections on a terrible movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has some of my most hated aspects of a horror film 1. Larger than life setting: Seriously, even for a department store the inside of that place was WAY bigger than was believable.2. Nonsensical Mutilation: Now why was it necessary to rip Amy Smart's jaw off!? Given the source of the 'evil' it really seemed more than was necessary. It was a cheap disgusting splatter effect.3. Illogically uncontained evil: Okay seriously, so ANY reflection brings the evil around? WTF? all the mirrors in the Department Store...maybe but the freakin door knob! 4. Utter lack of support for main character: Usually there's at least ONE person on the side of the main character...NOPE not here! NO ONE is on his side for the majority of the movie until the wife sees the boys reflection staying in the bedroom mirror.5. Ridiculously Stupid characters: Of course because he's the alcoholic ex husband the wife can't possibly even entertain the idea that something weird happening. Furthermore she stays in the house where they've already been 'attacked' and she leaves the kids alone while wandering through the water that he's consistently telling her NOT TO GO NEAR! His wife is a classic stupid horror movie character.6. Terrible Ending. If you've seen it you know, if you're going to see it you'll find out...I HATE when movies end like this...it's like...okay I just sat through that whole movie for THAT to happen...so stupidThere were a few good jumps, the effects to emphasize the fire in the beginning were kind of cool and for that I'll give it a couple extra stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie with great potential (but a pretty bad script)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate to say anything negative about a movie with my favorite actor Kiefer Sutherland and it would have been easy to rate this 10 points and then just let the whole thing go but unfortunately this movie doesn't deserve such a high rating. I can actually understand the major disappointment although I pretty much enjoyed the movie (though I don't feel like watching it again). Putting all the favorite-actor-feelings aside I can't rate this higher than 4.0 and that's pretty generous. It's a big shame, though. This movie had so much potential ? it could easily have been one of the best horror/mystery/whatever you call it-movies of the past decade. I mean ? Alexandre Aja (I personally don't know any of his achievements but he surely has a very good reputation), Kiefer Sutherland (a fantastic actor and I AM a huge fan) and great mirrors-stuff (a pretty good idea although it is kind of recycled). People were looking forward to this and the makers come up with this ridiculous script with laughable dialogue and a (I really have to agree here) terrible second half where the whole thing just becomes a big mess with absolutely zero sense. Again, it's a shame, because the movie started rather decently (besides the stupid dialogue). If you have enlisted Kiefer Sutherland for a movie, why can't you put a little more effort in creating good dialogue? It actually hurts seeing him struggling with this bad script ? wasting his talent. He tried so hard to ? kind of ? rush through the movie and he gives a very decent performance for such bad material. To people who complain about him just being Jack Bauer I would say that Kiefer actually can't help the fact that he looks like Jack Bauer and that he didn't write this mess of a script. And this movie really doesn't hurt him because he is one of the few good things about it and ? again ? it actually had some potential in the first place. Unfortunately he can't save this movie on a general basis. He looks good, though. Kiefer fans are rewarded but I am sorry for the rest of you ;). There are some good things about the movie (believe it or not). The music is fantastic and the first half actually comes up with atmospheric and ? really ? scary stuff (just avoid watching the trailer; it shows too much). The atmosphere in the Mayflower building is great and Aja really managed to come up with one of the greatest sets that were ever used in a horror movie. The movie has a great cinematography and fine camera work. Why the hell couldn't they work on a decent story to match all this? The right step would have been to avoid any explanation. Those mirrors were creepy at the beginning and if they had stopped explaining all this mirror stuff they could have come up with many other good, atmospheric scenes. The ending was cool. Let's just forget this second half.</fullReview>

The rest of the story is a butchery of a very good Supernatural/Thriller from Asia. This film is and was certainly not worth the admission price. About the only reason to see it is for the two death scenes.The plot-stunk and the "Explaination" behind the creepy mirrors-lame. The Asian version is so much better. Sure Mirrors had a creepy atmosphere and I can't complain about the acting, but man they slaughtered the plot so badly in this I am actually ashamed to have watched this before "Into the Mirror"-Asian version.Save your time, save your money, don't see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was of course a typical horror movie in my eyes. The one where it had potential to be really good, but it does things wrong here and there and it falls apart to either a bad movie or in this case a just okay movie. The story has a newly hired security guard for an old burned out department store making his rounds. However, in this department store there are quite a few mirrors present. Strange noises and sounds are a plenty. This guy is also a former cop on leave who had something bad happen during his time as an undercover cop. He is also separated from his wife and children and living with his sister. Well something seems to be trying to send him a message and it is doing so very violently to the point of going after his family. Seems the mirrors have a secret. So there you have it, to bad the revelation at the end of what was the secret does not really fit into the whole mirror theme. The showdown at the end to was a bit much as it seemed like it came straight from the movie "End of Days". Also, there were plot holes left unanswered such as the how the other security guard sent the package to our hero. Still, it was somewhat good up until a point. Keifer Sutherland added something to the movie and for a time I was really enjoying the atmosphere of the movie as it seemed almost like Silent Hill. However, Silent Hill Origins and Silent Hill 3 both had better scenes involving mirrors and they are games!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An usual remake with gore!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is based on a Korean horror movie. Nowadays, there are a lot of remakes coming up like Bangkok Dangerous and many more. The point of those remakes, they are made to be better than the original but as I can see, no recent remakes are better than the original. And it seems that directors want to keep remaking movies and think that the remakes are supposed to be better than the original. Back to the movie review, I have not watch the original movie which is called Into the mirror so when I watch this, i will treat it as I am watching a horror. Mirrors proves to be the least violent movie directed Alexandre Aja who did The hills have eyes and High Tesion which have strong gore. Mirrors boost one of the gory moment, a woman ripping off her jaw.The story: The usual horror remake plot. It is one of the longest horror remakes. I feel that it gets slow and draggy at some point. But it does build up the suspense and thrills plus blood and gore. The story is Ben Carson (Kiefer Sutherland) discovers that there is evil lurking in the mirror and killing off people and soon preys on his family. Ben needs to find answers to the reason of the evil in the mirror and blah blah...the usual story of a horror remake. There are some cheap scares which will scare or shock you out of nowhere.Overall: It is not very good but it still keeps my attention at some point. Those looking for scares and gore will look into this one. Those looking for interesting plot that will be able to you to the seat will probably yawn at this. It would be interesting to watch on a boring day. I see no luck with directors who keep remaking movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as effective as it could have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We begin by meeting a security guard running for his life into a locker room. He looks in a large mirror and his reflection cuts it's throat. The security guard collapses bleeding from a real neck wound.Next we meet Kiefer Sutherland as he starts his first day of work in a large mall that looks like castle/federal museum with giant ceilings and Greek columns. The mall burnt and is currently vacant only occupied by some leftovers from the stores mainly mannequins, furniture, and huge mirrors. The mirrors are squeaky clean. We are told the Kiefer's predecessor obsessed about keeping them clean.The life of Kiefer's character is a mess. Out of a job from the police department, divorced and in trouble with his lovely wife over the two kids, sleeping on his lovely sister's couch and apparently with some type of a prescription drug problem. On his rounds at his new job he discovers something odd. A hand print on a mirror. The print can't be removed. It's on the other side of the mirror. He also discovers a flooded basement. Back at home he starts seeing things in the mirror. And starts investigating things about the place and the security guard who he replaced. He suspects that it is not just in his head as others tell him but that something is not right with this building and the mirrors.It turns out next to the mall was a hospital where strange treatments took place in the psychiatric unit. As a result of what happened there to a young girl, the mirrors in the mall are trying to convey a message. Kiefer continues with the investigation tracking down the girl. In the meantime the mirrors start attacking his loved ones.There are a couple of twists near the end. The story takes on quite a different character from the mirror-attacking-people story. Also the end is a neat surprise. Unusual ending and very interesting.Aja knows how to direct horror and actors. And this movie is nicely photographed and has great camera work. There are some good scares and gore scenes. And the story itself is good. The only problem I found is that it's too long at nearly two hours and could have used a re-editing for tightness. The mirrors are as much as a character as Kiefer, who himself is not a very approachable guy in this movie. Overall a watchable milder horror film that could use either more horror or deletion of scenes to make it tighter more action-packed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mirror mirror on the wall, is this the most boring movie of them all?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Consistency, it would seem, isn't one of Alexandre Aja's fortes. Between 2003 and 2006, on the strength of his breakthrough Haute Tension (High Tension/Switchblade Romance) and remake of The Hills Have Eyes, the Parisian director found himself ensconced as a charter member of the "splat pack" alongside such horror notables as Darren Lynn Bousman, Neil Marshall, Greg Mclean, Eli Roth, James Wan, Leigh Whannell, and Rob Zombie. However whereas many of his contemporaries have continued to mature and refine their talent, Aja has found himself stuck in neutral of late, serving as screenwriter for the merely passable P2, and now missing the mark completely with Mirrors, a film on which he doubled up as writer and director.Based on the 2003 Korean film "Into the Mirror", Kiefer Sutherland stars as Ben Carson, a former New York City police detective whose history of alcoholism and wrongful shooting of an innocent during a previous investigation has him struggling to put his life back together. Carson's inner demons, coupled with his landing a job as a night watchman in a burned out department store whose mirrors appear to play tricks on the mind, hint at a promising tale designed to blur the line between reality and psychosis. Instead, Aja and screen writing partner Grégory Levasseur completely drop the ball. Early on they establish Carson's dependence on powerful prescription medication to curb his desire to drink. They also show him stumbling upon a bottle of whiskey during his first night in his watchman's cabin, yet they fail to use these plot points as anything more than red herrings, instead opting to spin a story about a malevolent supernatural force trapped in the store's mirrors and bent on escape. Sure it might be faithful to the Korean original, but clearly there was room for improvement that was passed over.I'm starting to wonder if the lure of large Hollywood budgets and marquee value stars has conspired to make this talented director grow lazy. Even his penchant for eye catching visuals is spoiled here as the interior sets appear to be a blatant re-hash of those used in 2006's See No Evil. And don't get me started about his reliance on pigeons fluttering for cheap scares - a tactic resorted to so many times I lost count.The end result is a tepid tale that's largely devoid of chills as it aspires to be yet another shoddy Exorcist variant, all of which is too bad given the possibilities of what could have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Better than the Grudge 2, and worse than the Ring. This is a story of Ben Carson, a man who is having a hard time in his life and (of course) is having trouble with his wife and kids. He gets a job because he is suspended from his old one and the new job reveals the eerie mirrors that shows him shocking images. When the mirrors threaten his family's life, things get personal as he attempts to solve the mystery of the haunted mirrors.To get to the point the acting was sub par, the dialog was cliché and underdeveloped (like most of the characters), some of the effects were laughable and really fake, and it was boring throughout many scenes.Basically you see him get spooked from mirrors for about an hour. See a couple bloody deaths, and then about 20-30 minutes of solving the problem. There were plot holes and people laughed in my theater at the attempted scary parts (yet there were people who were actually scared). Watch it if you like movies like Pulse, The Grudge 2, Shutter, One Missed Call...I'm sure you will like this too. If you were not scared by these movies..you wont be by this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Preface: I'm in the middle of a project where I take a look at formations of awareness, ontologies of the conscious space. A sidetrip, not fully fleshed in writing at this point, involves looking at the manifestation of horror, the rising impulse in mind.Okay, many will attest that Aja is a profoundly sloppy thinker, but now and then he tries to formulate cinematic expression from a conceptual basis. Haute Tension was bungled in the way described by most viewers, his produced Maniac is much more interesting; note there the killing camera. And this. Here, the idea is that a man has to cope with madness.Not vaguely so, but specifically the rising manifestation: the horror comes because he is not able to place horrific images, he mistakenly thinks the mirrored apparitions (the images) do not just reflect mind but are ontologically real 'in' the mirrors, reflecting real unseen fabric. So they become real, acquiring the believed story. In the end, he is trapped in the other side of the looking glass. Okay so the setup is too simple for my taste, a nightwatchman patrols an old shopping mall full of mirrors. The demonic angle is a wholesale loan. And halfway through, a psychiatrist shows up to explain in clinical terms, which further confirms Aja's problem: he is not working from a deep intuition, but merely repeats found ideas. And psychologically the idea is outmoded, positing 'inner' and 'outer'. Most viewers who center on the predictability of the horror and ideas are right to take a punishing look at the film. But I am ever so slightly charmed by the possibilities herein.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror flick that is not recommendable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is pretty boring horror flick with nothing recommendable about it. There is only one part of this movie that sticks out and that is the bath scene with Amy Smart and some blood that follows. Most of the running time is taken up with Kiefer Sutherland's character going around investigating supernatural stuff that happens within the mirrors. And walks around a burnt down department store with a flash light and a gun trying to figure out what is going on. When he hears creepy noises or screams instead of running he decides to go investigate it. And thus digs himself into a deeper hole. This might have worked better as a video game cause at least you would be able to control the character walking around with a flash light and a gun. But that isn't the case and it's boring. This is a remake of a Korean horror movie "Into The Mirror". Which I haven't checked out yet, but pretty sure it's better this this crappy flick. Near the end it was alright but it really isn't worth sitting through the whole time to get to it. Even the dialogue and scenarios unintentionally comes off a bit humorous than serious. Everything is just predictable and not really scary or has any tension. It's just not a recommendable horror flick.3.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mirrors is an intriguing horror movie. There's endless debate in IMDb about what the end meant or what was happening inside the world of mirrors. For me, it does not matter which version of the story is correct. I was entertained and that's all I wanted.Kiefer Sutherland does a very good job, especially the scenes where he jumps in horror by the presence of the 'mirror ghosts'. Paula Patton as Keifer's wife and Amy Smart as his sister play their characters very well &amp; with touches of glamor :) It was nice to see Jason Flemyng here as a detective but felt his talent was wasted in a short role. Of course, talking about the horror again, it was very impressive. Most of the mirror scenes especially in the beginning and the middle, were really spooky.The movie falls a bit weak in the final scenes where the scares looked a bit hurried and not as suspenseful as before. Nevertheless the climax, that took me by utter surprise, is excellent.Verdict: Unforgettable creep flick, whether you'll watch it again or not...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mirrors is an eerie horror film directed by Alexandre Aja. The film is simple, yet effective, and has you on the edge of your seat.The narrative focuses around Ben Carson, who as an ex-cop and ex alcoholic is forced to accept a job as a night guard, in order to get his life back on track. His new job is at a run down shopping centre, which was forced to close down after a fire devastated the entire building; that is everything but the mirrors. It doesn't take Ben long to notice how mirrors are in prestige condition. After learning that this was through the last watchman's obsession with them, he soon realises that the mirrors have an evil presence which lurks in them.The sequences filmed inside the derelict department store at night provide the overall film with scenes of suspension. The location is utilised to its best, with corpses manifesting within the mirrors and screams exude from within the depths of the building. One of the most memorable scenes takes place in a bathtub, and proves to be one of the most brutal and unsettling sequences within the film. The highlight for me though was in fact the ending. I felt slightly deflated when Ben staggers form the wreckage, because in reality no one would. Shortly after thats when the real twist is revealed and the film should be applauded for not following the traditional American happy ending.Alexandre Aja has proved his ability to create high tension moments within a narrative and also proves his ability to create genuine scares. Mirrors is definitely worth the watch.</fullReview>

When I see a scary movie that scares me, I still sleep well at night. For example: One Missed Call scared me a little but I was not scared of my cell-phone. When I saw the ring, I freaked out and I was not scared to pick up the phone. But Mirrors, after I saw it, I left the theater trembling and when I when to the bathroom and wash my hands, my dad said: "Look in front of you", I saw the mirror and I jumped (don't laugh). In the car I stared at the mirror in horror. At night I was scared to sleep knowing that I have a big mirror next to me, I was scared that I would see a ghost. I had nightmares. The pop ups and the scary images were so well made that I was gasping for air.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warning: Objects in the Mirror are more EVIL than they appear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Barely five years ago and especially in horror circles, the name Alexadre Aja pretty much was synonym with "prodigy", "breath of fresh horror air" and even "saviour of a dying genre". Of course, this was right after he came from nowhere and suddenly delivered the downright brilliant and genuinely shocking "High Tension". What a terrific film that was, and finally a true horror movie again that held the power to upset and petrify. Obviously, Aja's one-way ticket to Hollywood was a fact, but even there his first accomplishment ? a wildly outrageous remake of "The Hills Have Eyes" ? was a big success. One movie later, however, and Aja already lost most of his sharp movie-making capacities. "Mirrors" is yet another remake, but of an Asian ghost thriller instead of a 70's grindhouse classic this time. Basically this means the film isn't even half as exciting or gory and the screenplay risks to become tedious, confusing and ? worst of all ? infantile and politically correct. The film still nevertheless contains a handful of grim and beautifully suspenseful moments (especially during the first half) and unquestionably any other director would have messed it up even worse, but overall "Mirrors" is the umpteenth mediocre and unmemorable remake of an Asian ghost flick that wasn't even too good to begin with. Some of the positive elements of "Mirrors" include the casting and several of the set pieces. Like few other actors, Kiefer Sutherland can depict a mentally tormented protagonist and here he receives good support from the two beautiful ladies Amy Smart and Paula Patton. Sutherland plays a former cop who, due to alcohol abuse and personal issues, is forced to accept a new job as the night guard in an eerie warehouse that tragically burned out completely five years ago. Strangely enough, all the mirrors in the building are still intact and they appear to conceal a dark and macabre secret. Ben becomes obsessed with the mirrors and starts digging into the sinister past of the building. His family thinks Ben's going completely crazy, but soon enough the evil force breaks through the mirrors of the parental house as well. The first half hour of "Mirrors" is intriguing and extremely promising. Sutherland's character is complex (battling his own demons of the mind and all?) and the ruined warehouse building is a perplexing horror location. There are even some grueling bits of nasty gore in the first half, like a slit throat and a really disgusting sequence in the bathroom. But then the story becomes just too absurd, with the pursuit of 1950's mental hospital patients and nuns living in solitude. The climax inside the destroyed Mayflower warehouse is spectacular and flashy, but substantially void and quite dumb. The conclusion of the film raises more questions than it answers, but simultaneously it really isn't your standard type of Hollywood ending. Perhaps Aja still had some of his original French blood rushing through his veins at the moment of shooting. I'm really curious of what he will make of his next project; a reworking of Dante's creature-feature classic "Piranha".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MIRRORS is one of the better horror films I've seen in a while, unfortunately this film bares the burden of being a remake of a foreign film, so negative reviews don't come as a surprise, the odd thing though is that more than half of these film critics who write reviews on horror films, don't even like horror films, a buddy of mine told me about a film critic who wrote a negative review on MIRRORS, and gave it a low rating, after wards this guy admits he rather prefers coming of age stories or these retarded family dramas, so technically everyone who listens to this guy or reads his reviews, is listening to someone who doesn't like the genre in the first place, go figure.From someone that does like the genre, this film comes highly recommended, the cinematography is one of the great things about this film, especially with the mirror shots, Alexandre Aja is a director know for calling the shots on such brutal horror films such as HIGH TENSION and the HILLS HAVE EYES remake, taking that under consideration the way he uses the gore and his trademark of extreme violence, in a film that you would expect would rely on atmosphere and mood setting, it ends up complementing the film in a surprising way, the cast however do a terrific job, but there was an occasional rubber face performance, sometimes from Kiefer Sutherland himself, but mostly from Amy Smart.Overall, ignore the rants and ravings of an idiot that likes to be bored or driven out of his mind, and take the advice of a horror fan and go see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>cliché until the last 35 minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This entire film is ripe with cliché. From the use of psychology, religion, children ghosts, old abandoned buildings, notes from beyond the grave, and character naiveté, I almost wanted to turn this movie off and chalk up the time I spent watching it to an education on not to watch modern horror films. However, once the last 35 minutes or so (I didn't quite accurately time this, by the way) hits, it becomes something that I haven't quite seen before. There are some good scares, and, while it does remain somewhat predictable and has a couple of gratuitously gory scenes, it delivers well with a sense of originality and creepiness. I was on and off for the last 35 minutes of the film, but I was off for everything before it, and I finished "on". This movie will entertain you, if you can fight through the cliché horror film that is the first 75% of this movie. I believe Argento's Susperia had the tag-line, "The only thing more terrifying than the last 12 minutes of this film are the first 92." Well this film's tag-line should read "The only thing about this film that's terrifying is the last 35 minutes." (again, not accurately measured) So, if you think you can fight through cliché for a while, the last portion of this film is worth the wait.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie started okay. I mean, it's a horror film about mirrors, so you know it's not gonna challenge you with innovative ideas. Still, the first 30 minutes were solid, albeit a bit wasteful with the "loud noise scare".But then it loses its ways. Suddenly, bottoms of things need to be gotten to, big chunks of back story want to be revealed. Sometimes, it's done well, like with The Ring. And although Mirrors takes more than a few cues from that movie, it doesn't work.So after half an hour it became boring. It didn't help that the story was more like "The Ring"'s ugly sister. And the climax (with huge air quotes) was video game'ish.I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It has a few too many gore scenes for the mainstream crowd and way too much bad, superfluous story for the hardcore fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>another remake of a Japanese horror, so you just know there will be some genuine creepy and scary moments in the film. Keither Sutherland plays a police detective who has had his badge took off him for a shooting incident and takes up a job at an abandoned store that had been in a terrible fire five years previously. The store inside has many mirrors, and one night whilst walking around the premises, Keither sees something in the mirrors. Is he loosing his mind due to the strong prescription drugs or is something more sinister afoot....of course there's something sinister, i told you it was a remake of a Japanese horror. Somekind of demon is trapped in the mirrors and can travel to an mirror it wants in the world apparently and can some how kill you using your own reflection. Yes it is completely daft but there are some edge of your seat moments. Keither does play Jack Baur in a supernatural version of 24 though. I enjoyed it but its no citizen kane, but then again I never expected it to be anything more than what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't look in these Mirrors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mirrors is one horrible horror film. There is absolutely nothing good to say about this movie. Nothing at all. The premise is stupid, the script is awful, the acting is terrible, the effects are laughable. Kiefer Sutherland plays Ben Carson, a disgraced former policeman who takes a job as night watchman at a burned-out vacant department store. There are a lot of mirrors in the store. The mirrors are evil. The mirrors do terrible things. Kiefer, doing his best Jack Bauer, yells at the mirrors. The mirrors do some more terrible things. A bunch of nonsense happens as the movie breaks any and all rules it may have established. There is some gore for the sake of having gore, but the gore is done so badly you're laughing, not screaming. Paula Patton, playing Ben's estranged wife, contributes one of the worst acting performances ever seen. When you see what they have Patton wearing throughout the film it becomes obvious she was cast for only two reasons. And both of those reasons are located between her neck and stomach. At one point the filmmakers decide having her scantily clad isn't enough so they up the ante by having her scantily clad AND soaking wet. Bravo. Meanwhile, the mirrors continue to do more terrible things. Eventually there is an explanation for all of this. The explanation is as stupid as everything else in this movie. Finally we come to the big, climactic scene which is the most horrifically stupid thing of all, an awful idea executed with absurdly amateurish visual effects. Go ahead and laugh at how bad that scene is, how bad the whole movie is. Treating it as an unintentional comedy is the only possible way to get even the tiniest bit of entertainment out of this stinker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem with these major studio release horror flicks isn't actually the scripts, it's the production. They're spending way too much money and end up with visuals and cinematography that are flashy and drown the story. These movies probably read well on paper but the productions are beyond ridiculous. It's like a high school kid was given an unlimited budget to make the movie they wrote and won a contest with. It's not a bad script, it's just not a great one either and should have relied on the actors and production team rather than the money. The hotel should have been modest. The family shouldn't have been so cliché. Their house should have been more humble. Then issues such as the footage, everything just looks way to expensive. It seems the film makers behind these productions are more concerned with the movie looking expensive than they are with it looking artistic. There is a HUGE lack of art to this movie and the story got lost in the ridiculously huge budget. It's all polish with no internal substance. The studios green lighting these movies are embarrassing themselves. They keep hiring these European film makers, as though the Europeans are SO much more artistic than Americans by nature, and they keep churning out crap. In fact 9 times out of 10 if I see the director is foreign and the movie was financed by a major studio, I know the finished product is going to be a superficial piece of garbage. This has been the consistent product since the release of Thirteen Ghosts. I'd rather watch a dog eat it's own puke.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** This review is courtesy of Fundulgence.com - the One to watch. It also featured on BBC Radio Sheffield, Leeds and York. *** Kiefer Sutherland takes time out of his busy 24 filming/Parole schedule to star in this US unofficial adaptation of Japanese Horror movie 'Into the Mirror'. He plays a shamed LA cop and recovering alcoholic who takes a job working security for a burnt out department store, only to experience sinister visions in the surviving mirrors. He soon finds that the mysterious goings-on aren't limited to his work place and though greeted with scepticism, he fights to protect his family."Some of the inherent scariness is lost in the transition?" Mirrors bears all of the hallmarks of J-horror remakes, like 'the Ring' and 'the Grudge' before it, with the film tapping into universal fears and twisting them into an inescapable, relentless evil, whilst throwing in snapshots of distressing imagery along the way. Like its contemporaries though, some of the inherent scariness is lost in the transition, presumably in trying to make it more accessible to western audiences. Also, whilst there are some effectively eerie scenes, the frights that follow don't come nearly as frequently as they should, the plot devotes more time to the shallow detective work as the history of the building and its sinister events are unearthed."?events are freaky enough to catch Bauer on the back foot" French director Alexandre Aja - who also directed 'The Hills have Eyes' remake - has made a shrewd move casting Sutherland as the focus of the film. His character here is indistinguishable from 24's Jack Bauer (bar a few scars) -even down to the clothes he wears, so character building is largely discarded as unnecessary and if events are freaky enough to catch Bauer on the back foot, then it can only boost the fear factor can't it? It doesn't do Sutherland any favours though; he's even more likely to be typecast after 6 seasons of 24 and this on his CV over the past half decade."It's not for the squeamish" There are some twists and turns along the way, and it's not for the squeamish, but Mirrors is formulaic horror fluff. All the usual ingredients are present, the haunted house, small child possessed, and the disbelief in the film's protagonist (is it all in his head?) and you can't help but feel as though you've seen it all before, and done better.On reflection, this is may be an alternative to the next re-tread of the Saw franchise this Halloween, but it's standard stuff and Kiefer Sutherland starred in much better horror films 20 years ago ? why not rent out the Lost Boys or a 24 box set instead?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mirrors" has an interesting start but, somehow, everything starts to fall apart from there. There's absolutely no consistency in the whole plot, and the characters are, sometimes, kinda laughable (with the exception of Amy Smart's).Kiefer starts delivering a very dark, deep and problematic character, with a nice background story that is never really exploited. He then becomes a character that is "just there", to eventually end the movie as, of course, Jack Bauer. He gets thrown through walls, launched against hard-steel pipes with the force of the almighty EVIL, and, nope, he barely gets scratched. Honestly.But I won't give anything away. So, let's sum it up...The characters are never fully developed (nor the big bad, nor the main hero) causing some talents go to waste (like Amy Smart and even Kiefer Sutherland) and, the characters, have absolutely NO consistency especially the main villain (why didn't he just Immediately KILLED everyone in Kiefer's house? Or everyone with a mirror, for that matter?). And the whole Esseker thing is a very dumb and simplistic explanation.It's a very average (to bad) movie, but may be entertaining to watch with your friends or your girlfriend, especially at night, because, and here is the highlight of the movie, it has some scary moments and gory deaths. So, it's not ALL bad.The ending is all right, but it's one of those made only to impress, not to make sense. It kinda explains the beginning of the movie, but there's no explanation for WHY that happened.For me... Four out of Ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe I watched a different movie from the other Reviewers, but I found 'Mirrors' to be one of the best horror movies to come out since the Exorcist. And unlike others I did not go to watch 'Jack Bauer' beat the crap out of ghosts and ghouls Sutherland was believable in the role of a cop on suspension, trying to get his life together after the incident which forced his expulsion from the NYPD. Shocks come quick and fast and did not rely solely on college girls in Ra Ra skirts getting hacked to pieces. Mirrors is basically a haunted house movie, and it admirably manages to avoid most of the clichés inherent in the genre. Special effects are used wisely and may be too graphic for those amongst us of a delicate nature. There was nothing groundbreaking in this movie, but I got what I paid for, a scary atmospheric cinematic experience. Maybe the poor reviews on here come from the 'Doom' or 'Resident Evil' generation, brought up on a diet of Friday the 13th part 5,000 fodder. In addition notice that several reviewers have criticised it for not being a 'psychological horror', that's like saying a comedy movie wasn't funny because it didn't contain any slapstick. I liked it. But Chacun a son gout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An burned-out former police detective Ben Carlson (Kiefer Sutherland) tries his best to support his ex-wife (Paula Patton) and their two children (Cameron Boyce and Erica Gluck). He decides to take an night-shift security guard at a burned-down department store. Ben discovers that the departed store mirrors are somehow alive and those mirrors could bring out the worse in people. When the mirrors wants Ben to find a person, who was possessed by these mirrors over fifty years ago. Now Ben is forced to find this mysterious person, while his family are in danger.Directed by Alexandre Aja (High Tension, The Hills Have Eyes "2006") made an entertaining but flawed supernatural horror that really tries to be scary. Aja does manages to keep the story interesting with a few decent jolts. Sutherland is rather good in the role. But is somewhat of a step down from talented french filmmaker Aja, which his two previous pictures were truly creepy. Although an box office disappointment and critics truly hated the movie but it should found an audiences... once it is out on Blu-ray and on DVD. The Unrated DVD (Although it is only 10 seconds of additional footage!) has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an interesting 48 minute documentary of the movie, an featurette and deleted/extended scenes with optional commentary by Aja and Gregory Levasseur (P2). The Blu-ray edition adds an filmmaker commentary track and an digital copy of the feature. It is certainly worth a look, despite all it's flaws. Screenplay by the director and Levasseur. Loosely based upon the film titled "Into the Mirror". Super 35. (*** ?/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mirrors can be genuine skin-crawl material, yet these moments are too few and far between.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This year has been an odd one for the horror genre; so far this year alone we have been attacked by numerous unsuspecting serial killers ranging from angry vegetation and vengeful cell phones to heartbroken cameras out to prove a point and dodgy eyeball transplants. And so it only feels natural that we should continue this assembly line of ridiculous plots with another repackage of most of the movies mentioned above, which were also repackages; Mirrors fails to differentiate itself for the most part from its gimmicky companions, throwing together another extremely loose, overwritten bag of bones story that is far more effective at drawing laughs than scares. Yet the movie doesn't quite succumb to the low levels that some have reached this year, mainly through a decent middle act that showcases the lead man's talent at portraying a man slowly slipping into insanity. However, lumbered with a ridiculous opening act and an ending that mauls whatever is left of this corpse of a movie into something even dental records wouldn't help, the effort, although a little way away from being complete nonsense, still never makes it out of the ditch it digs itself merely from trying to convince us that this is even possible, scary or interesting.I've always believed that the greatest horror movies do one thing and one thing only; place an interesting character or set of characters into a situation in which they have no real control. Unfortunately however, as has been the case with the majority of the genre's output from the past decade, usually we are given a mystery-driven plot fuelled by clues that in the end help to solve the riddle which is behind all the paranormal murders. Through this, our protagonists find themselves in a sticky situation and from there go out to the supermarket, buy a crate of jam and begin piling more onto what they began with. One thing that Mirrors does do that is out of the ordinary however is that it drags TV star Kiefer Sutherland in to play lead. Yes, that's right, a man. Sure, it's superficial on paper; it shouldn't really matter whether the lead character is male or female, and yet it sure does feel refreshing to have someone who isn't in their twenties, overly vulnerable and always clutching to a grey cardigan who is out solving our newest paranormal game of Cluedo.Of course, much of his character and Sutherland too, is wasted on the trite that passes for a plot here, but small glimpses of this shift in focus give the film its only real highlight. Particularly surprising is the middle act, which stays a lot further away from all the 'spook and boo' than is usual and instead focuses the lens on the main character as his sense of reality and sanity is brought into question not only by other characters (this is routine for a horror) but by the film itself. At one point I actually got thinking that maybe a Fight Club was going to get pulled, and Sutherland would be made out to really be insane, yet, sadly this isn't the case. Instead, going from slightly interesting to downright moronic, the film spirals into a netherworld of plot twists, contrived action involving a demon and then some more plot twists. To say that this closing act ruined the feature wouldn't be accurate; it was already ruined. Yet, if the film had ended where it should have I could have walked out with at least some respect for all involved. Alas, I cannot. Remember the ending to the latest Exorcist movie? Yeah, it's a little like that.Of course, I'm trying my best not to divulge into spoiler material, but then again I really don't recommend you see this anyway; even if you want to. Sure, if you enjoy such films as One Missed Call and Eye, then Mirrors is right up your alley, and well, you should never read any of my reviews again. However, if like me, you cannot stand these pseudo-thriller-mystery-horror movies that fail for the most part to scare on any level outside of contrived 'BOO' moments, then you should do as I advise and give this one a miss. With certain potential, particularly in Sutherland's character, and maybe less attempts at trying to blend the illogical with the logical (such as these movies often do) within a plot that really shouldn't be taken as seriously as it is here, Mirrors could have been a throwaway treat for horror fans, but instead ends up being something that should just be straight-out ignored. Mirrors can be genuine skin-crawl material, yet these moments are too few and far between to sustain any interest or momentum in amongst all the less successful moments.- A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</fullReview>

From the moment Mirrors started i get the feeling that this movie would become gore and scary, I was right. In the first half everything explained to me that this movie had a terrifying story, but what the reason therefore was, was still not clear. And especially the old burned mansion was the ideal location for a movie like this... Lots of old Mirrors, And the were all a bit to clean.. This movie contains a lot of scary and a some gore parts. Sometimes it gave me the shivers. After seeing Mirrors I didn't want to look in the mirror even if I had no choice, I needed to ride back home and therefore I needed the mirrors of my car.I thought that Mirrors was a nice and entertaining Horror movie that surpassed the original. Definitely worth seeing!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You're probably thinking that a film by Alexandre Aja will be good since the French director created the masterpiece of 'High tension' and the intense creepy 'The hills have eyes'. Well his third film 'Mirrors' surprisingly a film that falls short and a twist that leaves you angry. The film might look like a good horror film since Alexandre Aja is directing it, it has a jaw ripping scene, and a good plot. Mirrors is about a night watchmen that watches over a place with thousands of mirrors. He thinks that the mirrors are a portal to another world and that it's trying to tell him something.Don't get me wrong I love Alexandre Aja and a big horror film. But as much as I tried to like it. I didn't. The acting is really bad. Kiefer Sutherland screaming 'Damn' and punching the mirrors and slamming them on the ground is crazy enough. If you are looking for a gore fest there are only four gory scenes with the jaw ripping scene being the goriest. Now the plot itself is weak. The mirrors trying to tell him something and Keifer Sutherland breaking mirrors, painting mirrors, and screaming is not perfect acting. If the film was screened by critics the film would have been trashed. Honestly I wouldn't recommend 'Mirrors'. I would say wait for DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mirrors is a decent horror movie. If you want to be scared all the way through a movie, then Mirrors is not what you want to see. There were a few parts where people would jump out of their seats but mostly it was a pretty dry movie. Kiefer Sutherland did a good job acting and it basically seemed like a horror episode of 24 during the parts he was in since he always had his trusty pistol with them that he uses as Jack Bauer. The CGI of the film I found to be pretty bad which kinda ruined it for me as I like more realistic things to be done with CGI then what they had in this movie. Overall this movie was OK, not too scary, good acting and not so great CGI but I thought it was worth going to see. If you really like the horror genre go see it, if you only want to see the scariest horror movies to come out, then pass on this one. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely the most intense movie I have seen. I'm a bit of a scary movie addict and I just don't get the rush anymore, but this one delivered. I was sweating at the end (and the theater was cold). The music was perfect. The acting was good but not 100% convincing on every character, so maybe a little more star power could have been used (that's why it didn't get 10). for a point of reference, I'd give silence of the lambs a 10 and the new batman an 8. I'd truly like to give a more concise review, but the IMDb website does not allow for a submission of a review, or what they call a "comment", that contains less than ten lines of text. I think that the reader of this review would appreciate brevity as much as a thoughtful perspective. However, this is not seemingly endorsed by the website coordinators. If this text is subject to editing by a human editor, as I suspect it may be, then we may not have to read through this review of the process itself. I would appreciate my comments ending in "batman an 8." to be the end of my published comment. I appreciate you having read my posting, whomever you are. Hopefully you liked it and can give this film a chance when you go see it, because you HAVE TO SEE IT IN THE THEATER. The audiovisual experience, especially if you go at night, will be well worth your while!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an offensively dull excuse for horror that defies intelligence and rationale and even has a major flaw for a horror movie: it's not scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps the reason why I despised Alexandre Aja's Mirrors is partially due to the fact that I am not a fan of the contemporary formula horror films that are all blood and guts and no story. All style and no substance. Why movies like this, and the Saw movies are so popular these days, I'll never know. But Mirrors is an offensively disturbing and dull movie that defies intelligence and rationale and it even has a major flaw for a horror movie: it's not scary.Aja's film, like One Missed Call (2008) is an American remake of an Asian horror film. In this case, Mirrors is a remake of the 2003 Korean film Into the Mirror, which was directed by Sung-ho Kim. I have not seen the said foreign film, but looking at its American remake, I think that it's basic plot was copied and any plot and effective story was left out. Mirrors has a creepy, but over-the-top plot. There is an evil force behind the world of mirrors (yes, there's a supernatural world behind the reflective glass) that wants revenge (or something) on a woman who was once a psychopathic killer. And as it turns out, anybody who becomes a night watchman and only a night watchman in the building where she was held for treatment, becomes a victim of the mirrors. This time the role of the sorry watchman goes to Kiefer Sutherland, who gives a performance as good as he as an actor could have done given the poor quality of the material he was given to work with. And as people die (in very gruesome, but far from scary manners), he begins to figure it out and goes on his own personal mission to solve the mystery before his family falls prey to the mirrors.Wow, what a plot! You got to be kidding me. Anyway, like I said, Mirrors is not a very scary film. It's a good-looking movie with some very good performances. Credit director Alexandre Aja for that, but discredit him and the screenwriters for the dull, ponderous story and the lack of chills and thrills or even general entertainment. Sometimes its disturbing, but in an offensive way. I will admit there was one scene, one of the gruesome killing scenes, that I felt my spine tingling and strayed a little bit before closing my eyes at night, but only for a few seconds. The rest of the horror scenes are cheap, over-the-top and recklessly bloody. Apparently, Aja did not study the Alfred Hitchcock rules of horror and suspense that make truly intense and scary films. But even still, Mirrors might have been better if there was a real plot and story and real characters behind it rather than just poor excuses for scares.What's more, the characters in the film, while well-acted, as offensively stupid in terms of their actions. For example, the Kiefer Sutherland character is a night watchman. He's suppose to keep intruders out of this building. So on his first night on the job, what does he do? He leaves the door wide open and walks away from it. What does he do when he finds a basement flooded with water? He wades waist-deep into it and turns on the electricity! And that's just two examples of countless examples of errors in intelligence and I will admit it that at these moments, I was actually mildly enjoying the film because my father and I were riffing on it like we were Joel and the robots on Mystery Science Theater 3000. That's really the only way you can enjoy a movie this bad.At two hours in length, Mirrors is far too long. At times, it's too convoluted and at other times, it's too simple. With a predictable storyline and a lack of scary moments, it proves to be nothing more than just a depressing time at the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Asian Remake. why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mainstream horror scene in Hollywood at the moment ' in my opinion ' is at an all time low. Blame it on the writers strike if you like but i put it down to laziness and a lack of originality. Why else would the studios continually regurgitate films from Asia and in most cases make a poor job in the process? Mirrors is yet another remake of a horror film from South Korea. It was originally called " Into the mirror " and was released in 2003 . The odd thing is , that not even the original was even given great reviews.A mall security guard becomes wrapped up in a mystery involving a particular department store's mirrors which seem to bring out the worst in people. Down through the ages, mirrors have always been gateways to other worlds; they have protected us from evil, they have told us the future, and they have told us the truth. Mirrors reflect back at the viewer a glimpse of the human soul. In stories handed down through folk beliefs of generations, and stitched into the fabric of fairy tales and myths worldwide, mirrors have been the gateways to other worlds. is this a realm inhabited by angels, demons, and spirits of the dead? Or, does it reflect back to the viewer a glimpse of the human soul?I like Kiefer Sutherland. He's no where near as good an actor as his father is but he is still very watchable nether the less. 24 is one of only a few American TV dramas i have not become bored with and i think that has a lot to do with Mr Sutherland Jr. He's pretty one dimensional and suffers from a monotone voice but there is something about him that i cant help but like.To be fair he's pretty good in this movie and Mirrors is not that bad . It has it's fair share of Scary moments and the some good special affect. There is one scene where Angela Carson rips off her bottom jaw while in the bath and it's definitely not one for the squeamish. There is quite a smart little twist at the end too that gives you a satisfying feeling and it also ties up a few loose ends.I am yet to be convinced by director Alexandre Aja's work . I didn't like the remake of the " Hills have eyes" but i enjoyed the thriller " P2" . He is currently in the process of remaking another horror " Piranha" this time in 3D . God only know how that will turn out.If your thinking of watching Mirrors then my suggestion is to try to get hold of the original. Lets not encourage the big studios to take the lazy route because I'm sure there are plenty of good home grown writers that could come up with something just as scary and more importantly , original.6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A not bad effort, with some creepy moments.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Carson takes a job as a caretaker at a badly damaged building that used to be a department store. As he begins to see strange and horrific things in the mirrors, he desperately tries to work out what is going on before it takes him and his family.....Mirrors is a remake of a Korean movie, called Into The Mirror. I've not seen it. But this movie isn't that bad. Directed by Alexandre Aja, who also co-wrote the movie, it has some genuinely creepy moments. However, it does suffer from a flaw in that some of the scare sequences don't work as well as they should, mainly due to a flaw that occurs in a lot of horror movies - the music. Some of the best scares have little or no music to build up the atmosphere beforehand, but on occasion music sets up a scare, that in the end, doesn't work as well as it should, mainly as it lets the audience know a scare is coming.The movie also suffers in that there are several plot-holes that leave to many unanswered questions. Also, I'm not sure the ending completely works. Towards the end, it turns more into an action movie than a horror one, which is a bit disappointing as this lessens the impact of the tale.The cast lead by Kiefer Sutherland are not bad, managing to convey their horror at the events playing out. And as I said, the director does manage to stage some effective scares.As a horror it's not bad, but not a great one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mirrors (2008) * (out of 4) Remake of the Japanese film Into the Mirror has Kiefer Sutherland playing a former NYPD who has fallen on hard times. He's trying to get his life in order so he starts a new job working security at an old building, which was the scene of a fire that killed over twenty-five people. Pretty soon he finds himself being haunted by images within the mirrors. Considering director Aja had been behind Haute Tension and the remake of The Hills Have Eyes, I went into this film expecting a lot but within twenty-minutes I was bored out of my mind and we still had another ninety-minutes to go. I'll start right there but having a film like this running 110-minutes is just downright crazy because the story here, as weak as it was, could barely make fit of a 80-minute running time. I'm really not sure where to start with this thing but it's pretty bad when a "scary" film is making you laugh. I counted at least seven times when I broke down in laughter when I was suppose to be being scared. Some of this is due to Sutherland's overacting, which caught me off guard because I've always been a fan of him. Perhaps seeing him act scared just didn't cut it for me. Another major issue with the film is its incredibly bad CGI effects. Just look at a scene early on when Sutherland catches fire. The fire effects are so obviously fake that I couldn't help but laugh and these poor effects are used later when more people catch fire. Aja tries to create an atmosphere but I never once felt it and I think the screenplay doesn't do the film any justice either because it likes to jump around, trying to be mysterious, but it just comes off as very silly. The running time seemed at least double what it actually was because every single scene just comes off as predictable and as something we've seen countless times before. How many movies do we need where we know the hero is right yet we have to hear everyone tell him that he's crazy? There were some bad horror films in 2008 and this here is one of the worst.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling Premise Turns To Ridiculous Cliché</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are five truths made evident in the film Mirrors. First, mirrors, with imagination, can be wielded with quite frightening results. Second, Kiefer Sutherland, unlike his father, cannot act. Third, Paula Patton has a gorgeous rack. Fourth, the whole psychiatric hospital in horror films concept has been done and over done. Fifth, Mirrors had the potential to reach top shelf thriller status but turns to stone glaring into its own reflection and topples recklessly to the ground.Sutherland plays Ben Carson, an ex-cop who finds work as a night watchman for an old, burned up Bloomingdale's-like department store. Carson soon discovers that there exists a malevolent, supernatural presence in the mirrors of the building. As he attempts to unravel the mystery behind the occupant of the mirrors, he realizes that his family becomes increasingly endangered and all dear to him will perish if the mystery continues to go another day unsolved.Despite Sutherland's inability to portray a believable character, the first two-thirds of the film succeeds in some decent spookiness. Unfortunately, the taut premise quickly unravels during the last 15-20 minutes, disappointingly so, becoming a "The Haunting" look-alike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>yes. yes very good movie. a few plot holes, slow developing plot, but all in all, not bad at all. Alexandre aja definitely did a better job with haute tension. (yes thats what you're supposed to call it. hah.) OK and hills have eyes wasn't exactly my favourite.... but mirrors was filled with great camera-work, great set pieces, cool angles, very wide crane shots and dollies down huge hallways, it was pretty cool. definitely a movie i would love to watch at imax. i would actually give this movie a 7.5 because Amy smart finally gets her tits out on camera and it was pretty glorious. then her face gets ripped apart ala' nightmare on elm st. people get killed in the mirror world but in the real world, you just see the wounds being inflicted on them, like in nightmare on elm st, you cant see Freddy in real life. this is one of my only complaints of the movie, how it borrowed a lot of stuff from other movies. also the girls twitching under the tables,, thats in countless movies, and the kids getting sucked under water like what lies beneath or any movie like that, lady in the water you know. yeah but mirrors was pretty good. i recommend it to anyone who likes cool horror films where a lot of the story is kind of being reproduced from other movies, regardless that its a remake. whatever. go see the damn thing. its not bad i promise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is so foul that it absolutely stinks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film might well have been called "Flashlights" because Kiefer Sutherland certainly spends plenty of time in the dark with dim flashlights and near-dead batteries. He stares into mirrors, while probably asking himself how he ever got duped into signing-on to such a dreadful movie. From beginning to end, "Mirrors" only reflected absurdity. It held as much suspense as watching a poorly-patched re-tread go flat. It is like a slow-moving car, with tires full of leaks, and is hardly a "Death Race". The film is boring, and offers no excitement. The movie drags, gets even worse after the first half--and makes one stare right through "Mirrors", wondering (with best intentions) when the film will ever end. And, the bloody scenes only left me seeing red, making it want to loudly scream "stop the movie!"The poor-written script had no coherence or logic, and made no allowances for any kind of direction (bad, good, or otherwise). And, the film does not even make a good comedy. The actors don't look like they're having fun, or enjoying themselves in any way, but the film does seem to be a bad joke on its viewers. They look into "Mirrors", but don't see relevance or substance. The film is just too-shockingly awful. It offers no substance, has no honesty or truth, and lacks integrity.The watchman cuts his throat with an unbloodied piece of glass. Amy's jaw is ripped apart by ten years of bad luck. Fires seem to burn everywhere, but not in the script or the performances. And, things really get out of hand when a nun is called-in for an obvious sequel to "Sister Act 2".I rank this film a 1 out of 10. Stay away from "Mirrors"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should Have been A TV Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Carson (Kiefer Sutherland) has seen better days. It's been nearly a year since the volatile detective was suspended from the NYPD for fatally shooting another undercover officer, an accident that not only cost him his job, but fueled the alcoholism and anger that has alienated his wife and kids and left him crashing on his sister's couch in Queens.Desperate to pull his life together and reconnect with his family, Carson takes a job as a night watchman at the burned-out ruins of the Mayflower department store. What once was a symbol of prosperity and grandeur now sits decaying in the darkness like a rotting ghost ship, destroyed by a massive fire that devoured numerous innocent lives.As Carson patrols the eerie, charred remains of the store, he begins to notice something sinister about the ornate mirrors that adorn the Mayflower walls. Reflected in the gigantic shimmering glass are horrific images that stun Carson.Beyond projecting gruesome images of the past, the mirrors appear to be manipulating reality as well. When Carson sees his own reflection being tortured, he suffers the physical effects of his fractured visions. Suddenly the troubled ex-cop finds himself battling his personal demons and the ones that have hijacked his reflection, tormenting him with convulsions, spontaneous bleeding and near suffocation.His sympathetic but skeptical sister Angela (Amy Smart) dismisses these bizarre "nightmares" as a consequence of his stress and guilt over the accidental shooting, but Carson's estranged wife Amy (Paula Patton), a no-nonsense NYPD medical examiner, is less forgiving. Her husband's increasingly erratic behavior frightens her, pushing his family farther away?and, she fears, it's putting their children in danger.But a much deadlier threat looms, trapped within the mirrors and reflective surfaces that pervade their everyday life. As Carson investigates the mysterious disappearance of a Mayflower security guard and its possible connection to his ghastly visions, he realizes that a malevolent, otherworldly force is using reflections as a gateway to terrorize him and his family.If he has any hope of saving his wife and children from a horrifying death, Carson must somehow uncover the truth behind the mirrors?and convince Amy to help him battle the greatest evil he has ever faced.

		<fullReview>The only reason I gave it a 3/10 was because of the great dp work. Other than that, there wasn't much to say. I should have walked out in the first 20 minutes. The lead actors had no chemistry what-so-ever!! Kiefer's character was horribly portrayed and it seemed more like he was doing this role for a paycheck rather than for the art of the film. The film was cast with "beautiful" people rather than actors. The storyline was not deep. The little "puns" and writing seemed to have been written by a novice or a sellout. The film, I perceive, was purely for the art of the mirror shots and great dp work. In order to make a film be the best it can be, you have to hire the best, and people that care to make the film work. It didn't seem the morale was very high on this piece. I do not recommend it.</fullReview>

Totally did not enjoy the ending even though it was unexpected (give the director his dues for that creative twist but i just didn't like it). overall, i am glad i didn't pay for it with my own money.

The master of the breathlessly whispered (if dubious) reassurance plies his trade as night watchman in the burned-out shell of a former upscale department store that had the misfortune to be right next door to a psychiatric hospital where they "treated" the canonical crazy adolescent girl.Firmly in the tradition of "Hey, there's an axe murderer on the loose. Let's all split up and go looking for him."

This movie, I knew within 10 minutes that I was in for a snooze. I would have left at 20 minutes without even ever wondering what happened, because I could tell there was no plot... I had to stay, my girlfriend made a wonderful pillow. When exactly did I fall asleep? A 2 minute scene where a girl gets poked in the neck and after 30 seconds of showing a wound not even worth of a band aid the mother dramatically hands the daughter a piece of gauz and says ''keep pressure on it''. How anti-climactic. This movie was one of the worst I can remember, maybe the worst..

		<shortDescription>A pretty good gore horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mirrors was a very gore movie that was pretty fun for the most part. It kind of took a while for the story to kick in. In this movie you have to pay attention really well to understand it. I did like the story a lot though. Their wasn't a whole lot of killings in the movie though. The killings that did happen though were very gore and had a ton of blood. The beginning of this movie was very cool and fun to watch. After that though the movie kind of slows down and became a little bit boring. This movie makes you really think what if mirrors could really do what they do in this movie. This movie is definitely to make you look at mirrors differently. I think for some people this movie will creep them out and make them afraid of mirrors. If you are a big mirror person though and don't like creepy images then don't see this movie. For big gore hounds and horror lovers this movie is perfect. It was a good horror movie and entertaining enough. The acting was pretty good nothing amazing though. Just like this movie good but nothing excellent. I think the cast was pretty good. The visuals were really cool especially with all the mirrors and in the beginning. I also thought that it was better than I expected it to be. So overall just give this movie a chance and see it at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mirrors Is Feel Good Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My girlfriend and I just came from seeing Mirrors, and neither of us have laughed so hard and so much since we saw the Disney movie "Enchanted". My girlfriend actually had to watch part of the movie from the hallway so that all the people around us who took the movie so seriously wouldn't be offended by how hard the two of us were laughing. She was in tears, and I was in awe.The two of us debated on the way home whether the director was trying to be scary or trying to be funny. She guessed funny, and I thought part of the awesome humor was how seriously the movie took itself.It literally had scenes where the "monsters" were posing in front of the screen effectively saying, "I'm scaring you! I'm scaring you!" instead of attacking.It is, quite literally, beautifully ridiculous. To borrow a term from the director of "Batman the Movie", the movie Mirrors is theater of the absurd. It couldn't be more silly or more enjoyable if Keifer Sutherland had made a crack about a chimpanzee with a machine gun.This is a complete failure as a horror movie; but that's okay, because it's fantastically funny to watch and is wonderful entertainment. Both of us were delighted to have seen such a feel good horror movie.At no time ever, not in the dialog, in the setup, in the murders and spooks is this movie ever scary or even cohesive. It's like a board room of twelve year olds who didn't even speak English saw The Exorcist, The Ring, 1408, Dark Water, Lethal Weapon and every single Sci Fi Channel movie that revolves around the divorced couple and mashed random effects, cliché dialogs, reactions and spooks. It's so incohesive that frankly my girlfriend and I are shocked that so many people think this is a serious horror movie.Keep in mind, of the whole theater we suspect maybe only six people in the room laughed and realized this was silly and fun. Everybody else was biting their nails and talking to Keifer Sutherland trying to tell him what not to do so he wouldn't take wrong turns.If you love horror movies and love horror movie spoofs, forget all the movies that intentionally try to parody horror movies, and see this one that doesn't even realize it's the modern day Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.The reason I give this an eight is that I reserve the highest reviews for true quality movies like The Fall, El Orfanato, Apocalypto, etc. But we had so much fun watching this movie that I can't honestly give it less than an eight.</fullReview>
