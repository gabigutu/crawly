		<shortDescription>Max Schreck IS "Nosferatu"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1921, director F.W. Murnau set out to make a horror film based on Bram Stoker's novel, `Dracula,' but was denied the rights to the property by Stoker's estate. Undeterred, however, Murnau merely changed the title to `Nosferatu,' the name of the title character to `Count Orlok,' then proceeded to make what has come to be considered nothing less than a classic of the silent film era. An unsettling film (especially for the times in which it was made), it is a faithful adaptation of Stoker's story, and brings images to the screen, the likes of which at the time, had never before been seen. And although by today's standards much of it may seem relatively tame, there is an innate sense of the sinister about it that is timeless. For the same elements that so unnerved audiences in 1922 when it was released, are equally discomfiting now, most of which is courtesy of Max Schreck, who portrayed Count Orlok. It was the first screen appearance for what is now the most famous vampire in history, and the German character actor Schreck brought an eerie presence to the role that has never been equaled. Bela Lugosi may be considered the definitive Dracula-- his portrayal is certainly the most well known-- but even he could not match the sense of evil that Schreck brought to the character. The scene in which Schreck's shadow is cast on the wall as he slowly negotiates a staircase, emphasizing his misshapen head and elongated fingers and nails, is an image that leaves an indelible impression on the memory, as does Schreck's overall appearance: Lanky, though slightly stooped, with oversized, pointed ears and haunted, sunken eyes. It was Schreck's greatest screen role, and had it not been for a lawsuit by Stoker's estate that prevented wide distribution of the film, it would no doubt have made him a star. The supporting cast includes John gottowt, Alexander Granach, Wolfgang Heinz, Max Nemetz, Gustav von Wangenheim, Ruth Landshoff and Greta Schroder. An air of mystery surrounded the set during the filming of `Nosferatu' that became something of a myth, which began with the fact that Schreck, a method actor, was never seen by cast nor crew without his makeup and in character. And it was further perpetuated when it may have been implied by Murnau that Schreck was actually a vampire playing an actor playing a vampire, all of which goes a long way toward proving that `hype' is nothing new to the entertainment industry. One of the three most highly regarded German directors of the times, Murnau, whose philosophy was that `nothing existed beyond the frame,' directed a number of films, but none achieved the lasting notoriety of `Nosferatu.' For film buffs everywhere, as well as aficionados of silent pictures, this film is a must-see, and a perfect companion piece to the recently released (2000) `Shadow of the Vampire,' the film by E. Elias Merhige that chronicles the making of `Nosferatu.' A comparatively short film-- the restored DVD version runs 81 minutes, the video, 63 minutes-- it will nevertheless provide an entertaining and memorable cinematic experience. This is an example of not only the magic, but the magic at the very core of the movies. I rate this one 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They don't make films like this faded, haunting masterpiece of silent cinema anymore.When Dracula was first put on sale for movie rights; the one of the first men to grab it was F.W.Murnau one of the most of the famous German directors of his time. By the time word got back to them about using the rights of the name and storyline of Dracula (Owned by the rights of Florence's widow.) Murnau had alread started production on the film; so to get around it they cut out the name 'Dracula' and replaced it with Count Orlok, Jonathan Harker became Hutter and Ban Helsing became Professor Bulwer; Orlock stalks the gothic streets of Bremen instead of Vistorian London.What is so different from Nosferatu and many of the others films of the time was that most of the film was shot on actually locations around Eastern Europe; the production hardly used any studio sets. What makes the most haunting feature tho is the sense of realism and the expressionism (most evident in the interiors od Orlok's Castle) that gives the film its hypnotic visual power.If there is any film a film student would need to have in his/her collection, it's this film. Although it is a hard task to find any surving copies. The reason for this is when the film was released Florence Stoker (widow of the author of Dracula) noticed the comparsion; she pursued the case relentlessly and in July 1925 a German court ordered all prints of the film to be destroyed. Luckily for us several prints of the film survived; a few in which have still been lost over the last few 8 decades.But thanks to the 2000 release of 'Shadow of a Vampire' a film which looks behind the filming of Nosferatu and starring John Malkovich (F.W.Murnau) and Willem Dafoe (Count Orlok) the film was released for the first time on DVD in it's full original length of 94 minutes.Sadly soon after the film hit America in 1929; at the age of 43; Murnau was killed in a car crash."Men must die. Nosferatu does not die!" proclaimed the original publcity for the film. We can only hope it's the truth for this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my two favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite possibly my own very favourite movie. No vampire film before or since has been either as disturbing or as artful. Less overtly "expressionistic" than some of the other German films of the day, but no less visually impressive. Look at the seascape where Ellen/Nina/Mina pines over her departed husband. Watch those marvelous shadows, which we see in Bremen more often than the vampire itself, used especially effectively in the closing sequence.And look at Max Schreck himself! While Bram Stoker gave his Count affinity with wolves and bats, Murnau favours that rat, both in that they surround him and that he physically resembles a shaved, cadaverous rat. Spreading his pestilence, Max Schreck is truly the vilest, most loathsome villain in the history of film. The scene where he rises suddenly erect from his coffin aboard ship is one that horror directors everywhere should study very carefully.Nosferatu is also noteworthy as the origin of the idea that vampires are killed by sunlight, previously present neither in literature nor folklore. In response to the poster who complained that the vampire seems to be walking around in light before his death, these scenes are set at night. In the original versions, there was a blue tint over these scenes to let you tell night from day; it's difficult to tell the difference without them.My copy is marred with some hilarious inappropriate sound effects (such as a massive "BOING" when the gates of the castle open on their own accord) which I've learned not to hold against the film itself.Thank God that Florence Stoker did not manage to completely wipe this film of the face of existence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I'm sure it is the case for many cinema fans, my respect and admiration towards this production widely excels the enjoyment I had while watching it. "Nosferatu" is a milestone from every possible viewpoint and it's one of those very few movies I think everybody should view at least once (although it actually requires repeated viewings?) It is the very first version of Bram Stoker's legendary vampire tale and easily the most copied film in the history of cinema. I'm sure everyone is familiar with the story of young estate agent Jonathan Harker traveling to Transylvania where he acquaintances the eccentric count who feeds on blood and controls the ones he has bitten, but THIS is the original version. Shot by F.W. Murnau (who also made the equally essential titles "Faust" and "Der Januskopf") and made unforgettable by Max Schreck in his performance as the Count. And, even though this film is over 80 years old, Schreck's image is still as nightmarish as it can be. No visual or make-up effect could ever surpass the simple appearance of Max Schreck! The fact that this film is still very powerful therefore almost entirely depends on his unworldly character. "Nosferatu" is beautiful poetry, difficult to watch at times, but very rewarding. The sexual undertones as well as the shock-aspects have surely dated by now, but they're still present, and ? as I mentioned before ? they only increase my respect for Murnau and his crew. A definite must see, just make sure you're in the right mood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My conception of the vampire made celluloid...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I despise most vampire stories. Not even Florence Stoker's dear departed husband could keep me occupied after the first act in Transylvania in "Dracula". The vampire has been so romanticized as an archetype (particularly during the '90s) that I can't but feel that most horror fans have forgotten exactly what made us afraid of these guys to begin with. Murnau's "Nosferatu" is just such a reminder and, because of that, is the only screen version of "Dracula" that I have ever loved.Though Murnau, in the hopes of dodging the copyright bullet, took many liberties with the novel, he actually shot a great part of the film on location (an unusual practice for the time) in the historical Dracula's old stomping grounds: the Carpathian Mountains in Romania. The town, landscapes, and castles were all for real, not just some fancy studio backdrop. To me, it helps convey the tone of authenticity, as you can believe this story being told. As for Max Schreck, no charming, suave seducer is he. With his bald head, bushy eyebrows, rat-like teeth, pointed ears, nails as long as the fingers they are attached to, emaciated build, and stare that seems to come from the bottom of Hell itself, he is the primal, archetypal image of the vampire of legend.While some could interpret this tale as a subtext to Nazism or anti-Semetism, at it's core, it's simply the tale of a monster, who brings ruin and death in his wake. That such a tale has managed to survive it's era, considering the obstacles that could have totally removed it from view, is the gain of all who have seen. Eat your heart out, Bela Lugosi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Distinctive &amp; Memorable Version of the 'Dracula' Legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>F.W. Murnau's version of the 'Dracula' legend still remains as distinctive and memorable as ever. The enjoyable Bela Lugosi version is perhaps easier to watch, and strictly as light entertainment it might work better, and many later versions brought their own interpretations - but nothing matches "Nosferatu" for its engrossingly morbid atmosphere and its unusual interpretation of the main character.Max Schreck and Murnau were able to create an image of the vampire that remains in your mind long after seeing it. Regardless of whether it or some other conception is closest to the 'true' Dracula (if such a thing even exists), it is quite effective, and it was particularly well-conceived for a silent screen version that cannot rely on dialogue to define a character. The settings and the story perfectly complement Schreck's weird character, creating an atmosphere full of constant strangeness, uncertainty, and foreboding.It's unnecessary (and probably impossible) to make detailed comparisons among all the film versions of the Dracula character and legend. "Nosferatu" stands perfectly well on its own, as a unique and skillfully done adaptation of the story, and as one of the memorable classics of the silent era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>superb silent Dracula</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For copyright reasons, Bram Stoker's novel was filmed with the names of the characters changed (Orlok for Dracula, for example) but otherwise the story remains the same: a young man goes on a trip to see a mysterious count in order to sell a house, leaving his bride behind, and finds that the creature he meets is not of this world.As the extremely creepy Orlok, Max Schreck is brilliant, with his long fingernails and gaunt appearance. A triumph in early cinematic make-up. Gustav von Wangenheim portrays the confusion of the victim well, as does Greta Schroder as his wife. FW Murnau directed the film with flair, showing us not only shadowed vistas and abandoned castles, but the nature outside (foxes) and miniature worlds evolving under a microscope. This film sits well with his later 'Sunrise' in showing the effect of outside forces on a young couple, as well as being one of the key early horrors in its portrayal of Stoker's anti-hero.This version of the Dracula tale remains one of the best, although all have some different perspective on the novel. On the strength of 'Nosferatu' alone, Murnau deserves his place as a true innovator of silent cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the great celebrations/critiques of cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Nosferatu' opens with a man looking at his reflection in a mirror. Besides its symbolic significance, this is a perfect distillation of his character, that of a vain, narcissistic, absurdly self-confident to the point of machismo, married man largely indifferent to a wife he abruptly leaves to make the fortune worthy of a man of his merits. He ain't afraid of no ghosts, nor robbers. So, the image he sees in that mirror is one of wholeness, perfection - I am Hutter, I command all I see, my unity of identity is linked to my power in body. To the viewer, however, the effect is the precise opposite. The framing of the scene is fragmented, with the outer frame, the window and the mirror; Hutter himself is doubled - the 'real' Hutter and his reflection, or shadow. All the assumptions smilingly embodied in Hutter will thus be destroyed in conventional horror terms. His whole identity will be destroyed - the Count will suck his blood and in effect become him, if we believe the man who claims 'blood is life'. Hutter's body will first become passive, feminised as he is violated by the Count; after, he will no longer be a body, but a shadow, bloodless - literally, he shadows the Count as the latter comes to England; and symbolically, in that two men now claim possession of Hutter's wife, and both have equal claim, both being Hutter. Murnau is careful to give his horror story a genuine patina as an 'objective' story: no horror film has come as close to capturing the visual essence of all those stories that have circulated in Europe for centuries, the twisting medieval towns, the arcane religious symbolism, the plagues and mass hysteria, the crumbling castles and storm-tossed ships, the creak of wood - the look of the film feels like a crumpling manuscript setting out the story. But the film is also the portrait of a marriage. The opening sequence chillingly reveals the sterility of a marriage before anyone has even heard of the Count - Hutter wrapped up in himself; Ellen, hypersensitive, morbid, dressed as if in mourning; the union childless; the couple, above all, separate, each completely misunderstanding the other. The image of the mirror is repeated throughout the film, connecting Hutter to the Count - the scene in Knock's office where Hutter looks at the map of Transylvania just as he did his mirror; the Count's house directly opposite Hutter's, a decaying edifice that looks like a melting, anguished face. But Ellen is linked to the Count too, her somnolent rising mirroring his. This isn't a conventional opposition between bourgeois and bestial urges, even though the Count is given the most grotesque (anti-Semitic?) animal features, and even though Murnau never lets us forget the Conut as emanation of the Hutters' dreams, desires and fears - Hutter reads that he will shadow his dreams; Ellen spends most of the film sleepwalking. All three elements of this triangle, which symbolises the one relationship, is linked to death - the Count, the undead, living in coffins of dead earth; Hutter, narcissistic, onanistic, his lifeblood siphoned from him; Ellen, the Venus fly-trap, self-abnegating destroyer of the destroying force. Hutter ends the film as he began, alone, his lust for money and status destroying the union that crowned it. The contrivance of society and respectability is swept away by the malaise of nature, those gendered forests, tides and moons, as if the Count and Ellen are part of the one female nature Hutter cannot accomodate.Such Freudiana is undermined in the film in two ways - in the disarming comedy of the piece, the Count often seeming to have strayed from a silent comedy, running around London with his coffin; and by a self-reflexive examination of film, that sees the warning about vampires in the book Hutter reads linked to bestiality and the eye that is so important in the film; the turning of the film stock into negative as Hutter enters the Count's realm; the trickery, such as time lapse and fast motion, that shows the Count's mastery of time and space, but, more importantly, Murnau's mastery over the storytelling, already indicated by an unseen, but constantly intruding narrator; even Ellen's couch, which, my husband suggests , seems patterned as strips of film. In a movie where human sexuality is impossible, the characters seem content to be voyeurs, like the film audience, staving off the death, the loss of identity, or at least its fragmentation, that contact with another person entails.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a truly original Vampire film- a tale of the Gothic legend in Murnau's masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nosferatu is a great horror movie (possibly the first ever according to some accounts), and one of the pinnacles of the German silent era of film-making. Made in the silent age by the German expressionist/auteur FW Murnau, the film has the genuine power to act creepy, odd, alluring, mythic, and beautiful by way of images and music that don't leave your mind once the film is over. It's like someone collected a stash of nightmares and pulled them together with the original Bram Stoker story of Dracula. Max Shreck, in his most notorious role (and apparently the only one really anyone's bothered to see) plays the monstrous Count Orlock, a vampire who comes out at night to tempt the living and, of course, to suck blood. Though this story of Dracula has been numerously repeated (even by the Hollywood version in the early 30s), this film is one of the prime examples of how horror SHOULD be done- dispense with cheap thrills or overloading with exposition. A director like Murnau here, who had total artistic control (abeit the film not in circulation for many years), could transform Orlock's world into one of acute, deliberate angles, long deep shadows, and painting with light like some mad artist from the dark ages. One could almost claim that this, alongside Night of the Living Dead, changed the way audiences looked at horror films, that a style and presence could be wrung from characters that bring out the worst fears and dread in common people. Years from now, long into the digital age, there may still be room for of all things a silent, non-talking effort like Nosferatu, where the terror can still be felt through the black and white (sometimes tinted) photography and stark physical performances by Schrek and the others. In short, a film like this is one of the reasons I love to watch horror movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good mixture of suspense and action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the Kartes Video Communications 1984 video cassette version on a 15 inch screen. Titles were in English. Film quality was good. Sound was matched to action. Cropping appeared good, and titles were completely visible. This should give an idea of the technical quality of the release I watched. Nosferatu is one of the few silent movies with a significant following today. It deserves a following. The film is a suspense piece. Still it is paced nicely so that it feels tense in the right places but never goes long enough without something happening so as to be boring. Visually Nosferatu forms the precedent for the vampire in movies. The main difference is that Count Nosferatu has more affinity with rat than bat. Aside from this the main stream image of the vampire is based heavily on Nosferatu. This film has been as influential on modern vampire mythology as the novel Dracula. It is based on the novel Dracula. Especially disturbing to me personally are Nosferatu?s twisted hands. In terms of the film?s being silent, this should not put anyone off. The suspense/ horror genre fits well into this medium. I was lucky enough to see a version with music matched to the scenes, but if the copy you are watching has a bad sound track just play some music you like. I recommend this film to anyone interested in the horror or suspense films. It is a bit of a cult film, but this does not keep it from being actually good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still remains one of the most visually harrowing movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want you to go back, way back, before CGI effects, box office predictions, acid trip movies, black and white, even sound, we had silent films. We've of course remember them, but how many of us have really seen one? I happen to love them though, my film appreciation class made me run out and get as many silent films as possible, one of the most memorable silent films of all time is Nosferatu. A film that still to this day remains one of the most harrowing movies of all time. Say what you will about how far special effects have come into today's movies, but the silent film really made this movie into the true horror story that has memorable images and still gives me nightmares.Thomas Hutter is an employee at a real estate firm in a city called Wisborg, living with Ellen, his wife. His employer, Knock, receives a mysterious letter. Knock decides to send him to visit Count Orlok in the Carpathian Mountains to finalize the sale of a house. Hutter leaves his wife with his good friend Harding, and Harding's sister Ruth, before embarking on his multiple-month journey. He goes on the trip and he is soon picked up by Count Orlok's coach, which is driven by a strange specter that hides its face, and moves at an unnatural speed. At his arrival at the castle, whose doors open by themselves, he is welcomed by Count Orlok. His grotesque facial features hidden at this stage by his hat, Orlok initially appears to be a mere eccentric gentleman. Hutter has dinner at the castle; Orlok refuses to eat and silently reads a letter. A bell rings at midnight and a startled Hutter cuts his thumb. Count Orlok tries to suck the blood out of the wound, but stops at Hutter's horror, who then falls asleep in the parlor after a conversation with Orlok. Hutter wakes up to an empty castle with fresh wounds on his neck, he's oh so doomed at this point.The very first vampire movie of all time, when F.W. Murnau couldn't get the rights to Dracula, he created actually one of the most memorable horror movies of all time. Seriously, if you have never seen this movie, try to find it, and if you dare say that the image of Orlok waking up and rising out of his coffin doesn't scare the ever loving daylight out of you, I'm going to go all Clockwork Orange on you, tape you to a chair put toothpicks in your eye lids to keep them open and you're going to watch this in the dark. This movie is a true classic and will always remain one of the scariest movies I have ever seen.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Is Definitely Not Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the American industry got around to making it's vampire entry they must have felt that U.S. audiences needed their monster to be softened. What a difference between the two interpretations!While Hollywood was smart enough to cast an east Europe type (Lugosi) they lessened the dread factor considerably by dressing him up in formalwear and giving him no real teeth to speak of. Orlock has teeth and they look very, very sharp indeed. The hollywoodized Dracula looks less like a monster and more like a romantic leading man when contrasted to the Orlock character of this German film. No one will ever attach 'romantic' to their description of Count Orlock.Where Lugosi would attempt to convey his brand of menace by means of a penetrating, hypnotic stare and holding up his fingers, Shreck has no need of such staginess. Where 'Dracula' (1931) has fake, vaguely European sets, 'Nosferatu' (1922) is truly Europe. In it's silence Nosferatu feels more ominous than does Dracula, what with his slow, deep-voiced, stilted speech which seems contrived and even unintentionally funny at times (how often have comedians utilized it since?) And wolves and bats are far less creepy (almost noble by comparison) than are rats and spiders. Nothing noble about rats.I didn't set out to write a disparaging review of 'Dracula'. I've loved the Lugosi version since childhood, but when I saw 'Nosferatu' many years after numerous viewings of the Universal series I realized very quickly that the fear factor of 'Nosferatu' was leagues ahead of the American version, and frankly, I was initially dumbstruck by this fact. I would never have guessed that a silent-era horror film could be so much more striking than the films made over the next five decades!Whereas Hollywood gave us a fun, not very scary, but deservedly much loved movie classic, F.W. Murnau has given us a fascinating, visionary masterpiece of horror cinema. Students of film art will likely explore 'Nosferatu' more than once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing Much, Just Another Pretty Face</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a bit disappointed in this. I had seen a few of visuals that are sometimes shown because "Count Orlok" is so bizarre-looking, so I finally decided to check this famous German silent film out and see what all the fuss was about. Well, it was much ado about nothing, frankly. Yes, Max Schreck as the Orlok-Dracula was fascinating to view. No one has ever quite duplicated his strange facial features in over 80 years of film-making, makeup or no makeup. That was worth some of the price of the rental, but the story wasn't. It just dragged too much and the other characters weren't much.I did learn a few things, however, about Bram Stoker's Dracula tale that I don't believe I have heard in other Dracula movies, such as how many and why coffins of dirt accompanied the Dracula on his voyage. That, and a few other tidbits, were interesting, as were the different colored tints on the some of the scenes.But, story-wise, it's a bit too dated and too slow for today's tastes, I'm afraid. Also, 84 minutes of a fairly-strong pounding of organ music can get to be a little much. Silent film purists will not like that last statement, as they seem to revere these scores, but, hey, all I can say is: "bite me!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>clammy and creepy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although at a rather quick 90 minutes, experiencing 'Nosferatu' seems as surreal in its semi-illogical disjointedness as an early Bunuel film and not unlike a dark and dreary drinking binge; one recalls only certain sequences of the narrative, punctuated by large gaps in time and in the association of events/characters. This doesn't necessarily detract from the overall enjoyment of the film, but rather adds to its eternal strangeness.Hans Erdmann's (?) original score is at once darkly foreboding and highly hypnotic -- like Count Orlok himself -- with its haunting phrases unfolding and folding back on themselves like a spiral. Orlok similarly comes out of the darkness to glide through walls or up stairs and then, receding from light and recoiling his claws, he inexplicably vanishes from sight (and from script) for minutes on end....only to re-emerge from within his coffin in one of the film's most infamous images.Orlock's insatiable lust for young blood gives the film an erotic charge otherwise repressed in the waking lives of the "human" characters of Jonathon and Nina (surfacing only slightly in Nina's somnambulism).The two most amusing moments in the film also depend on the "non-human" characters of sickly Renfield and his master, the Count. Renfield escapes from his prison cell pursued by a large mob of locals and, fleeing to a rooftop, starts throwing stones at the angry Volk while wearing the mischievous grin of a child. The Count, meanwhile, adds an element of surrealism as he does a skinny-legged shuffle through town with his own coffin in tow. Still quite creepy and darkly comical after all these years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, it was rude of the film makers not to consult Florence Stoker about the use of her late husband's book to make this film. She was entirely within her rights to have the whole thing consigned to the flames, though even a cursory look at the worst prints in circulation reveal what posterity would have lost had she succeeded. At its best this is an extraordinary achievement, and its a pity that its many fine qualities went largely unappreciated in 1922 - and for some time thereafter.However there is no point getting bogged down in false veneration. Nosferatu has some glaring flaws which reduce its status from the towering masterpiece it is purported to be. The cinematography is often crude, even by 1922 standards. The script robs Stoker's story of its grandeur and blatant eroticism - there is a brief nod to the latter only in the final scenes. In place of sex the director has placed pestilence, which may or may not be an asset, depending upon your stance. Of much of the acting, well, the less said the better, and some of the special effects are frankly risible. Compare the journey from the Borgo Pass to that in Tod Browning's Dracula, made only nine years later, to see how inept parts of Nosferatu can be.On the plus side one has to applaud a film that maintains its terror and stark imagery almost eighty years after its release. At its best Nosferatu is that rare creature, a truly frightening and disturbing horror epic. It is a triumph of design, and the attention to detail is overwhelmingly impressive. Max Schreck manages to deliver a performance that is aided and abetted by makeup, but whose real impact derives from its sinister restraint.A mixed bag, then, something it has in common with its 1931 Hollywood remake. I know I swim against the critical tide when I say I prefer the latter, but that is not to deny the power of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this a late night viewing and perhaps being tired made full concentration difficult, but this was not an easy film to evaluate in light of it being a silent film made in Germany in 1922 by Murnau.The overall impression is one of familiarity with the "Dracula" theme, the young man being driven by a coach that will only go so far toward its destination before he has to get out and walk. (This has happened in so many horror stories that we can see it all began with stories like "Dracula" on which this is based). GUSTAV VON WANGENHEIM is the young man and he overacts with gusto in typical silent film manner. GRETA SCHRODER is his wife, Ellen, who seems to have an unusually strong link to Count Orlock's menacing presence. She's the woman whose portrait he is shown, upon which he makes the film's most famous remark: "What a lovely throat!" It's all very impressionistic, with dark shadows particularly menacing when they show Count Orlock's grotesque form (including his long fingernails) as he looks for victims. Some of the plot elements seem a little obscure which may be a fault of the title cards.Very impressive was the musical score from 1997 by James Bernard which had the appropriately eerie effect that caught the mood of the piece with its somber atmosphere.Damp and chilly are the words that come to mind when I think of this film and its overall effect. I can certainly see why it has the reputation it has as a classic horror film with allowances being made for the style of acting that was anything but subtle by today's standards. Worth a look, but not a film I'm likely to view again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is both a ground breaker and a classic. Ground breaking in that it was the first vampire movie, the first in its use of sunlight to kill a vampire (which thing I understand to have been a new concept at that time and original to this film), and a leader in the genre due to its style and quality. Classic in the use of black and white, shadow and light, makeup, and special effects. The scenes, the way they're shot, and the flow of this film are marvels. Max Schreck is the perfect vampire. He represents the animated corpse in wonderful fashion. The story line, character development, continuity, photography in particular, and attention to detail are a tribute to the German cinematic artistic ability of the day. This thing is more than just worth watching. Its worth watching again. It would seem that great vampire movies are like that. Just when you think they're dead forever they resurrect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What a lovely throat"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FW Murnau's Nosferatu - the most famous silent horror film, the first adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula and containing some of the most memorable and terrifying images ever committed to celluloid.The German Expressionist directors can be credited with inventing the horror genre. Not that works with a horror theme hadn't been made earlier elsewhere, but the Germans were the first filmmakers to actually use the medium of cinema to frighten the audience. In Nosferatu this is not just done by the disturbing look of the vampire, but by a number of cinematic techniques. For example, the huge distorted shadows are more eerie than seeing the real thing. He also nearly always has the vampire walking towards the camera, as if he is advancing upon the audience.Max Shrek's as Dracula (or Graf Orlok, depending on the version) has to rank as one of the best performances of silent cinema. Not only is the vampire a brilliantly creepy creation in makeup, but the way Shrek moves and positions himself ? stiff, spindly and slow, like an animated corpse ? completes the character. The parts of the original Dracula novel which dealt with the vampire's ability to change into the shapes of various animals was dropped for Nosferatu, but Murnau references them by having Shrek creep like a rat, hunch his shoulders like a bat, rub his hands together like a fly and so on.Other than Max Shrek, the other actors are decent but not outstanding. The performances are highly melodramatic and exaggerated, even by silent film standards. This was probably a deliberate request by Murnau to heighten the unreal quality throughout the picture, although having said that he favoured over-the-top performances even in straight dramas like Sunrise (1927).Murnau had a great eye for space. His shots are often reminiscent of works by the Dutch painter Vermeer ? cramped interiors with open doors leading to distant vanishing points. This helps to give the film a tight, claustrophobic feel.Like DW Griffith, Murnau makes extensive use of cross-cutting. However, whereas Griffith would use cross-cutting to make comparisons between historical events or to create a tense race-against-time, in Nosferatu the effect is much more psychological. He reveals the psychic link between Jonathon and Nina by cutting between him being attacked by the vampire and her nightmare; he defines Renfield by cutting from him to Van Helsing describing a carnivorous plant; he shows Nina's troubled mental state by cutting from her sleepwalking to shots of the raging sea.Nosferatu is an early landmark in horror films. It's not Murnau's best though, and also sadly due to its history there are no perfect prints available. But the fact that it is still so well known and still has the power to creep out modern audiences is testament to it as a great piece of film-making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Technically Brilliant But Something Just Wasn't Right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no doubt that this is a technically brilliant movie - groundbreaking considering that it was made in 1922. It's well filmed and features generally pretty good performances from its cast all around, within the parameters you would expect for the style of acting used in silent films of the era. It also gives us the German actor Max Schreck as Count Orlok - who may be the creepiest, most monstrous and most frightening take on the Dracula character ever - far more than Bela Lugosi (who basically defines the role) could ever hope for. It's even funny in places - I think of the scene where Orlock looks at a picture of Hutter's wife and says "your wife has a beautiful neck." It is, of course, a variation on the Dracula story, with the names changed and some significant parts of the story changed to get around the fact that director F.W. Murnau didn't have the rights to the story. But those changes don't detract from the basic story. In fact, they may enhance it by giving this a fresher sense. You don't know exactly what's going to happen because there are some differences. It has a lot going for it no doubt.But something's not right. Maybe - as good as Schreck was (and even perhaps superior to Lugosi) - Lugosi's take on the character has so entranced all subsequent adaptations of the story that this just doesn't seem like the story. I found it very difficult to enter into this. It's not a problem with silent movies. I've enjoyed a number of silent movies over the years. But as well made as this was, this just didn't draw me in. I had to sit with it a number of times before I could sit through the whole thing - and at 1:20 it's not very long. And yet, to be honest, there's not any particular problem I can put my finger on. For all the good things involved with this production, something just wasn't working for me. It's unsatisfying to me that I can't explain what the problem was. It's just that there was a problem somewhere. Still, a movie as well made as this that was made when it was can't get anything less than 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dracula masterpiece of the silent screen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>F.W. Murnau directs this unauthorized version of Bram Stoker's novel, Dracula. NOSFERATU is arguably the earliest surviving screen version depicting the 'Prince of Darkness'. This German production deviates slightly from the original, but the now familiar story we all know by heart is intact. Count Dracula becomes Count Orlok and journeys to Bremen, Germany instead of London. His physical appearance is not dashing, mesmerizing or even mystical; but much resembles the rats that frequently accompany him. I find this the most eerie of all that would follow. The accompanying organ music background makes this scratchy black and white silent film an essential masterpiece. Max Schreck is immortal as Nosferatu/Count Orlok.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was really impressive and quite an experience to see. Who would have ever known that a silent movie would still be so powerful now days.The power of the movie is in the fantastic atmosphere. The sets and environments are perfect and give the movie an unique atmosphere that actually is very creepy, even now days. It's also thanks to the cinematography that captured the images perfectly. One of the most atmospheric movies I have ever seen.The story is told in a great way and I must say that it's told better than any other Dracula movie later released. The movie is full with some classic horror scene's that later would inspire many other filmmakers.And yes the movie is actually scary, which is mainly thanks to Max Schreck who plays the part of Count Orlok in a most incredible way, also helped by some good make up. Most of the other performances are typically early movie stuff. Meaning that it's silly over the top at times. Gustav von Wangenheim gives a great lesson in overacting and his laugh might very well be the weirdest I have ever seen in a movie. But in a way all those performances give the movie a certain charm which makes it irresistible to watch.There are also some surprising good special effects. Better one's as in the 1931 version with Bela Lugosi anyway. Some of them were really impressive and I can imaging it really seriously freaked some people out back in 1922.Truly a piece of movie history that needs to been seen by the movie lovers, especially by those who like the horror genre. Still after 82 years one of the best horror movies of all time.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

Nosferatu is flawed, but it still does manage to hold up quite well, considering that it's nearly 100 years old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorry Ange - It's No Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I once had a friend called Ange who many years ago attended a certain university to take a " visual arts " course which is a euphemism for film studies . As can be expected at graduate level the course featured the usual suspects of Soviet Montage , Italian Neo-Realism , La Nouvelle Vague and German Expressionism . I won't identify the university but from what I heard it seemed like the worst university in England with one tutor being a former smack addict and another seen out on the club dance floors totally wired on cocaine . The standard was so bad that when the final test came someone in authority messed up so badly that the students had to revolt so they'd actually receive their final degrees . After this the visual arts course was taken off the syllabus and hopefully the tutors found a vocation better suited to their talents like sitting outside train stations pleading for any spare change . Still despite this Ange seemed to enjoy the course especially the German Expressionism part , so much so that she bought NOSFERATU on video . However after then seeing this movie - which is free to view online because it's in the public domain - I'd really hate to watch the films Ange didn't like if this is the best the university could showNOSFERATU has a complicated history . The producers couldn't obtain the rights to Bram Stoker's novel of Dracula so changed the title and character names . How they managed to get away with this I've no idea since a similar analogy would be making a film called LORD OF THE THINGS featuring creatures called " Bobbits " and who have to throw a thing in to an ancient volcano or else the forces of evil called " Dorks " will conquer Middle World . Hmmm I wonder if anyone would notice the difference between this and a certain book ? In fact the version I saw makes no pretense that it's a wholesale copy of Dracula and uses the character names from the original source novel The problems with the film is that it's never expressionistic or stylised enough . We've all seen clips of it like Max Schreck's Dracula rising from his coffin and his shadow entering the room of Mina but this is atypical from the rest of the film . There's very little surrealism , bizarre set design , nightmare imagery or any anything expressing the sensations the characters may be feeling . In truth it's very conventional with many scenes that are supposedly set in the dead of night being filmed in daylight It's not a bad film and considering it's silent and feature length I never found myself praying for the end credits which speaks well of its pace and rhythm . That said it's a cinematic legend that no doubt features in all university film courses and led to Hollywood making a film called SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE starring Willem Dafoe as Max Shreck so a mainstream audience should rightly expect more from NOSFERATU . Certainly THE CABINET OF DR CALIGARI is much more impressive and memorable and I do wonder if Ange should have wisely spent her money on something else</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>uber Vampire, ultra Dracula, before the glamorizing of the legend!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nosferatu (1922)You can't look at a movie as interesting, original, and yet technically dated as "Nosferatu" the same way you would a new movie, or a Hollywood classic. Murnau's truly great horror film comes a full decade before the famous "Dracula" that copied so much from, and it has to be seen on its own terms, in the thick of the German silent era. Even as a silent film it is five years from the stylish peak of the genre, and so there is a creakiness to some of the techniques (the edits, the iris effects, and so on) that come with the territory.But it's never slow, and in many ways is much more together and sophisticated than Tod Browning's 1931 version, which of course has at least the addition of sound and of Bela Lugosi, the new star, to make it legendary. Here there are a lot of details in scenes not bothered with in later versions, as in the journey on the ship to England, which is one of the most beautiful parts of the movie, or scenes of the countryside which set a place more than a mood.Of course, the two movies are more similar than different, with the basic vampire legend intact--sucking the blood from the necks of beautiful young women, for starters, and needing to avoid sunlight. The expressionist light is wonderful even if it's just showing a swarm of rats. The camera-work is gorgeous, even when static, and when it moves (as on the ship) it's elegant and modern. There is an overuse of the iris vignetting effect for our tastes, no doubt, giving the scenes a constraining feeling rather than a limitlessness that even Browning manages to achieve, and of course Coppola and Herzog do much differently in their recent versions. In fact, see all four. There are others, but these are the famous ones, not including the miserable but campy Warhol vampire film, and the rather different Dreyer 1932 version called "Vampyr," and then some offshoots that are sometimes terrific, but which are not really based on the same story line at all.It's odd to talk about a vampire movie and not mention the main actor, the vampire player, in this case Max Schreck, but in fact he has no meaning for American audiences. The director, F.W. Murnau, is another story, with a stellar brief career including the Hollywood masterpiece, "Sunrise," which won the first best picture Oscar ever. For that reason alone I'd give this fun, slightly spooky vampire flick a good late night look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the truly great horror movies.It is the story of Dracula although he isn't called Dracula because of legal reasons involving Bram Stoker's estate.Maybe it is just as well because this 1922 classic isn't like any Dracula you've ever seen.Even by the time of Bela Lugosi's classic ,Dracula was portrayed as a suave debonair count.But in this great film the Count is a scary little thing.Rat-faced with sharp rat teeth and long nails and the look of disease all about him.Max Schreck is simply amazing in his role as the Count.His portrayal of the ugly little monster is one of the greatest roles ever captured on film.Speaking of captured on film,this film is almost a hundred years old ,and it looks it.There are evenly lit places and scratchy looking segments and the film speed is a little off in places but that all just adds to the great atmosphere that this masterpiece has.Several scenes from this film have become iconic,none more so then the Count rising straight up from the bottom of the ship.The scene where the Count carries his coffin through the town is as freaky and eerie as anything I've seen.The way Max Schreck walks will even scare you.There was a rather expensive restored version of this film done back in the 1990's.Most cheaper copies will come with a crappy added on sound track,death metal or something like that,I always turn that off along with all the lights and let this little creepy silent film flicker away in the still of the night.Watch this one if you haven't.It will stay with you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eeek! Vampires!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having recently seen this as part of a university module on film from Germany's Weimar era, I can safely say that "Nosferatu" is one of the best films ever made, especially from an atmospheric and cinematographic point of view. The film is suggested by Bram Stoker's "Dracula" - I say "suggested by" as opposed to "based on", as whilst the premise is the same, the names of the characters and the story's general tone are changed to something more Germanic. Perhaps even more so than the influence from Stoker, "Nosferatu" is equally influenced in a number of aspects by German Romantics ranging from Caspar David Friedrich to E.T.A. Hoffmann and the Brothers Grimm. Thus, the vampire seems more of a folkloric figure from within one of the darker moments in a fairy-tale from Grimm than Stoker's did, and the relocation of the time period and setting is to Germany during the Romantic era (no less).The film succeeds because it incorporates aspects of fantasy-horror and Expressionism, yet at the same time uses realistic settings (often "on location") extensively; in comparison with the likes of "The Cabinet of Dr Caligari", which were stylistic affairs confined to a studio. This creates a subtle spooky mood, which inhabits the viewer for a good while after the film is over, rather than provide quick short thrills that die as soon as the credits roll like with a number of horror films. This makes for an excellent film, which ought to be watched.</fullReview>

Even Bela Lugosi's interpretation as good as it is can't compare to what Max Schreck brings to his interpretation of the Dracula figure Count Orlac. Murau's tight and focused direction is without peer. Some trivia: In German "Schreck" mean fear, terror. The "edition" I saw was issued in 1991 by Film Preservation Associates and has the title "Noseferatu - Symphony of Horror", with the credit: Freely composed by Henrik Galeen. The Dolby digital score composed and performed by Silent Orchestra is highly effective and well conceived.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Highly influential silent horror classic. It follows the basic story of Dracula. As pretty much everybody knows, they did this adaptation of Stoker's novel without permission. His widow sued and won. The court ordered that every print of this film be destroyed. Thankfully for us, somebody saved a copy. That this film was made nearly a century ago is astonishing. The makeup for the ratlike Count Orlock, played by Max Schreck, is amazing even by modern standards. Orlock still stands to this day as the most uniquely frightening vampire ever put on film. Director F.W. Murnau creates an eerie, otherworldly atmosphere. He uses many authentic "Old World" locations that are very spooky. There are lots of creepy and scary moments in Nosferatu. As much as I love the Universal and Hammer Draculas for their entertainment value, I think this is the scariest of all the different versions I've seen. It's best seen at night, as most great horror films are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never having read the novel, I don't know how closely this film follows Bram Stoker's tale, but it certainly sticks fairly closely to the narrative we've come to be familiar with from later movies.Renfield is a real estate broker in Bremen in 1838 and he sends agent Jonathan Harker to Graf Orlok's castle in Transylvania to close a sale on a dilapidated apartment complex in Bremen. Graf Orlok is Nosferatu, or Dracula. He's played by an actor called Max Schreck, which in German is a joke.Renfield is under his far-away spell, though Renfield's place in the plot is problematic, at least in this version. I mean, he's an agent of Nosferatu. So what? His thread is a dead end.At any rate, Harker makes the trip to the Carpathian Alps where he is warned by the peasants at the inn to avoid the Count's castle at night. Ha ha, laughs Harker.And actually Harker is pretty dumb. Nosferatu meets him at the castle entrance and, alright, this is a fantasy, but no normal human being would get within ten feet of Max Schreck. The creature is grotesque. He has no neck. His ears end in Darwinian points. His incisors look like hypodermic syringes. He wears these skinny trousers on his long legs so that he seems to be walking on stilts. And his fingernails are those of a Chinese mandarin. Not to mention that nose, which alone signals an organism desperately in need of attention from St. Michael the Archangel.I don't want to go through the entire plot. It differs from the classic Bela Lugosi version in a few ways. There is no business with mirrors, garlic, crucifixes, Mogen Davids, bats, St. Christopher medals, silver bullets, or stakes through the heart. Renfield's part is, as I say, largely irrelevant, and the Count's second victim, the pure Lucy, hardly appears. Neither does Professor Van Helsing.This isn't the spookiest version of the tale, although it gets all sorts of kudos for originality. The most frightening version is probably the one with Frank Langella as the count. (I get the titles all mixed up.) It's the most nearly believable because we can imagine the smooth, handsome Langella bringing women under his spell. Francis Ford Coppola's rendition is hardly more than an exercise in style. The classic, with Bela Lugosi, has the advantage over "Nosferatu" of being a talkie. It's replete with lines that are unintentionally hilarious. "Da spider spinnink his vep faw da unvary fly." And, "I never drink -- wine." There have been numerous parodies too -- "Love At First Bite."It was directed by F. W. Murnau and released in 1922, but it wasn't what I expected. Murnau was said to be fond of moving the camera around, sliding it sideways, lifting it. As someone once said of Murnau's directorial style, "They took away his crane and then/ I thought he'd never smile again." But this is shot from eye level. Howard Hawks could have done it. There's little stylization in the sets either, not a touch of expressionism. This is light years from "The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari." Yet it's enjoyable enough. It's bad when Nosferatu is sucking the blood of the poor folks in Transylvania and it's even worse after he moves to Bremen and people start dying all over the place. We always want to see Nosferatu finally get it in the neck himself, if he had one. And actually he gets smoked in the end. Harker's wife follows the directions for exterminating vampires and allows Nosferatu to suck her blood until he's trapped by the rising sun, at which point he disappears in a puff of smoke like the devil in Faust.Vampires seem to have never died -- at least not in cinematic history. There currently appears to be a fascination with them. Several recent movies have shown them as in conflict over their conditions, reluctant to breed with humans, but still ultimately evil. I've tried to figure this out. They're obviously symbols for some other marginalized group, but which group? Gays? The mentally disordered? Pedophiles? Cigarette smokers? Clearly something that Hollywood isn't ready to handle without spells and mirrors and legerdemain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On Google you can get statistics on how often men who work in high rise towers use the washroom (don't bother) but I keep waiting to see stats on the number of "serious" cineastes who have never seen a silent film...? Some think that, like sushi, it is an acquired taste. Not really. Remember that, in the age of books (those rectangular things made of folded paper), readers had to "imagine" BOTH the visuals and the audio. So here we are one step closer to Imax, if you prefer to think of it that way. Anyway, if you have never seen a silent film, this is where you want to start. The strangeness of both the film and the actor (Shreck) have never been duplicated. The movie is unforgettable, a term I cannot readily recall using often in my reviews. So unforgettable that (this is extraordinary) some 80 years later Hollywood did an entire production not as a remake, but rather an alleged narrative based on the filming of the original -- and that film hinted that the reason the actor in the first was so effective was because (wait for it...) he was a real vampire who just lucked into getting the part. Wow.(Another silent film recommendation: the original Zorro, demonstrates what we today call "athleticism" to a degree that is extraordinary).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Nosferatu' came out on a very disturbed time for the world history. Germany had lost the war only three years earlier, and because of this fact that the 'German Impressionism' cinema movement began. In this movement, lots of important movies came out that redefined genres, created genres, and influences film-making up to today. 'Nosferatu' is one of the most famous pictures of this time, along with 1919's 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari', 1927's 'Metropolis' and 1931's 'M'. This movie is loosely based on Bram Stroker's Dracula, and it's the first adaption of the famous novel. But I really don't like the way the story was presented here. It isn't told well, and looks a bit confusing. The titles are too vague, and they don't really explain what's going on. This is one of these movies in which you don't really care what's going to happen. The plot is about a house salesman that is sent to Transylvania in order to sell a house to Count Orlok. The Count buys the house, but only because he is interested in the Count's wife. After this point, the story turns into something weird, and nothing like 'Dracula'. That's why I think it's unfair to compare this with 'Dracula' (although I do prefer the 1931's version of 'Dracula', but as I said...). The acting is really the main reason this movie is so famous. The supporting cast is all excellent, but it's the main part that steals all your attention. Max Schreck is absolute perfect as Count Orlok. He provides a haunting, yet serious and scary interpretation. There's even one movie in which the matter of him been a true vampire is discussed (2000's 'Shadow of the Vampire').The other aspects aren't really worth mentioning. F. W. Murrau's directing is okay for 1922, so is the rest. The titles are well made, but confusing. One thing that really bothered me was the blue and yellow tints to represent night and day, but this is not a problem only with this movie. Lots of 1920's silent movies utilize this resource.Overral, this is a mice movie, with an excellent acting, but a confusing and bad-told story. From its period, I prefer much more the also German 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First and the best of vampire movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes, I think that from over hundred years of Cinema history the best, the most creative and exciting years were in the relative beginning, in the first decades of the 20th Century. The old films that I've watched lately don't seem old - they are timeless. Their beauty and mystery -unsurpassable, their influence - immense, the pleasure they bring - incomparable. Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens made in 1922 by F.W. Murnau is one of these movies. It is so finely crafted, so well thought of, so lovingly produced, so beautiful to look at, and so creepy and genuinely scary that I believe it will stay one of the best films of the horror genre and true inspiration for present and future directors, and not just horror film directors. A Symphony of Horror is a pure cinematic delight, poetry on screen from the first shot to the final. Werner Herzog came quite close in 1979 in his updated color version of the same film but I prefer Murnau's film a bit more, perhaps, because it was the first one and Murnau had no previous film to compare to or more likely, because no one, even fabulous Kinski could not be as creepy and frightening as Max Shreck.The B&amp;W photography with astounding use of sepia gave some scenes a somber dramatic, Gothic tone. Each frame deserved to be captured and enjoyed for the sheer beauty and elegance. The scenery was breathtaking, storytelling - solid and compelling. Hans Erdman's 1922 score created a perfect sound background for the story. The most fascinating asset of the film though was not even acting but simply presence of Max Shreck. What a mesmerizing magnificent ugliness that would not let you take your eyes off his face, fangs, ears, and spider like fingers. The first film in the vampire series, Nosferatu started genre of poetic horror, the most interesting and artful in the family of horror films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror masterpiece which, after all these years, is even more enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>F.W. Murnau indeed has a significant place in movie history. He was the director who invented camera movement in his wonderful 1924 production THE LAST LAUGH. He is also known for having directed one of the most beautiful silent romances, THE SUNRISE (1927). Besides, it is maestro F.W. Murnau who adapted Goethe's marvelous FAUST to screen in 1926. Finally, it is him who, not having any serious reference to how a horror film was being made, proved unbelievable brilliant uniqueness of thrill through the still classic horror, constantly a prospect film for all scary movies, NOSFERATU. We have a number of horrors nowadays... yet, NOSFERATU is still enjoyed by viewers galore... is that not an interesting phenomenon? Of course, the period of time which has passed since the premiere of the film is huge and, as a result, there may be some people who will dislike the movie after all these years: no camera movement, silent performances which tend to constitute "overacting" with "overgesticulation" (from today's perspective), undeveloped cinematography. Nevertheless, I think that because of the movie's old age, it has a stronger sense of suspicion and mystery nowadays than it used to have decades ago. I still absolutely admire this film for its constant power to thrill and shock while the awareness that the movie is more than 80 years old additionally thrills me. Modern horrors are, generally, so unoriginal and similar in their conventions that there is still no movie that could be compared to Murnau's 1922 masterpiece. How come that a movie made in the early 1920s with limited filming techniques can thrill the 21 century viewers? This leads me to one conclusion: Murnau's film really served its purpose to the very core.The number of scary moments are something the film can still boast. Who can forget Hutter's visit to Graf Orlok's castle? Who can skip the facial expression of the vampire from the coffin? Who can possibly omit the terrific atmosphere when Nosferatu is on ship? And the moments with mosquitoes... I personally loved many of these scenes, but particularly two sequences have remained in my memory for good: the one at the castle filmed at marvelous Orava in Slovakia and the final one when Nosferatu's shadow is seen walking upstairs.The performances are exceptionally good, yet on the condition that they are interpreted from the silent era's point of view. This is the only factor that may disappoint some today's viewers. Yet, the facial expressions and gesticulations (these are the major factors that one may take into account when applied to silents) still do the job. Max Schreck is still horrifying as Count Orlok. Consider his face, for instance, at the scene when he says about the throat of Hutter's wife. Greta Schroeder is also memorable as Ellen, particularly at the moments of her trances. Alexander Granach in his portrayal of Knock also provides a viewer with a thrill of fear.NOSFERATU is a very well made horror movie, a silent I would recommend to everyone who likes scary movies. I also consider the movie a must see for all movie fans. Highly recommended movie with unforgettable atmosphere that has become even more intense due to the fact the movie was made such a long time ago. I love it and although I have seen it a considerable number of times, I am going to see it once again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Land of the Phantoms</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life's Pictures Will Turn to ShadowsVampires are one of the most popular horror myths out there that age centuries ago. We have no shortage of films for them. There are probably dozens or hundreds of Dracula/vampire movies ranging from the suave Dracula played by Bela Lugosi to the Vlad the Impaler type Dracula in Coppola's 1992 movie 'Bram Stoker's Dracula.' However, one image, one vampire movie has stood the test of time and appreciation better then any vampire movie ever made. Nosferatu, the first vampire, literally. F.W. Murnau wanted to make a great vampire movie. But he did it differently then most people would later do. He didn't make a sexy exotic man with a heavy accent, more so since the film is silent. But Murnau wished to create a vampire, which would disgust us look-wise. One vampire who is ugly, looks like a corpse, ugly rat faced monstrosity. He created Count Orlock, known as Nosferatu.Of course the story is based from Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' and was almost forever destroyed by Stoker's widow for copyright reasons. But this still wins as the greatest vampire ever. The story merely is changed by names. A man named Thomas Hutter (Gustav v. Wangenheim) is a real estate agent who is hired by an odd man named Knock to sell property to Count Orlock, who lives in an ancestral castle in the Carpathian Mountains of Transylvania. He is warned all the way by townspeople that he is heading toward the land of the phantoms. In one scene we see him mention Orlock's name in a motel and everyone falls silent. Horses scare away, and a Hyena snarls outside. Murnau uses these images to show something is definitely wrong.Hutter's carriage refuses to carry him further into the land near the castle, so Hutter is forced by foot, but soon after Orlock sends a carriage driven by a phantom. The carriage moves in fast motion showing that something is dark about it. In one shot of the journey in the Phantom chariot, Murnau uses a reverse negative showing trees appearing white with dark leaves and the black chariot. A very eerie look of the scene. Hutter meets the Count, and at dinner Hutter cuts himself, where as Orlock is fascinated by the sight of his blood, 'Your precious blood!' he exclaims. Hutter feels sort of uneasy, especially with his occasional reading of 'Book of Vampires.' After dealing real estate with Orlock he sees of locket of Hutter's wife. 'Is this your wife? What a lovely throat!' he says. That night, Hutter catches Orlock in his Nosferatu form, and is attacked, but after Ellen, his wife back in England feels danger, she calls out to him, and Nosferatu stops his attack.Now that the farce is totally up for everyone (even if it was predictable) I will refer to him as Nosferatu now. He leaves his castle to move into the home he bought across from Hutter's house. They both leave, Nosferatu by ocean raft and boat. A plague falls upon the ship, and I don't need to explain what happens with the rest of the crew. In one part of the ship scene, we see a coffin slam open as Nosferatu rise up like a clock hand from laying to standing position, an effect good for that day and age. Now begins the trial of death and plague. Unexplained deaths come with his arrival. Ellen and Hutter fear, especially after Ellen reads The Book of Vampires. Ellen decides to sacrifice herself for the town. After she sees Nosferatu staring at their home through the window across the street, she asks Hutter to get the professor, so he cannot stop what she inevitability will do. Nosferatu sneaks into her horse, and corners her, using mystique powers to render her helpless before sucking her blood.What Ellen read was that a woman pure of heart must keep a vampire up till the break of dawn to kill him. This happens, in one of the most memorable scenes ever in horror. As the cock crows, we see a close-up of Nosferatu as he lifts his head from her neck eyes glaring at the camera, looks toward the window, tries to walks away but is destroyed by the sun using a clever effect for it's time period of film-making. Hutter finds his wife; she is alive for a moment, but dies. She used herself for the greater good. She saved many more lives.Max Schreck plays Count Orlock, who has the best acting in the movie, with his sinister expressions, and slow, stalking movement that scares us into a feeling of never escaping terror. In today's aspects, this film is not scary, but it is creepy in the sense of the looks of Schreck with his pale face, long nails, bat ears, and two rat-like fangs. Nosferatu's blood-sucking carnage of a woman in the film gave it a slight sexual tone to some audiences. In one shot toward the end we see only the shadow of Nosferatu go up the stairs making it more eerie, especially seeing those long nails in shadow grow longer as his hand goes for the door. Max Schreck is also never seen blinking on screen which is odd to me but I wouldn't know why. However this movie is not perfect, in fact the acting by Gustav v. Wangenheim is horrid. Not good at all. He is a walking clich with his over dramatic gasps and his 'Good morning sun' type attitude pre-Nosfertu attack.Murnau directed this brilliantly. His use of editing is great, especially when Nosferatu attacks Hutter with cuts to Ellen's waking. Use of symbolism, fast forwards, and reverse negatives give this film the quality it has. This movie is the best vampire movie ever. A classic, it has withstood the test of time, and is a travel into the evil of life. No sound is needed to creep out a viewer although a classical score helps the mood. Even though a rip-off of Stoker's novel, in the end it inspired most of the Dracula films to come out. A very dated but must see film. Two thumbs up, hell I'll throw both my arms up.Rating: 9/10 Label: Cinematic Masterpiece Favorites Rank: #21</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first Dracula ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Subtitled "A Symphony of Horror", "Nosferatu" is the first, and on of the best, of many movies inspired by Bram Stoker's "Dracula". Directed by one of the cinema's true poets, who helped create the language of the horror movie, it is a dreamlike film where much is left unexplained. The geography is deliberately vague, and several characters, such as the Van Helsing figure, Professor Bulwer, have little connection with the main action. From the start there is a sense of unease and menace, but everything is done by suggestion without any explicit violence. Blood is constantly mentioned but never seen. Plague overtakes a city but we are left to imagine the state of its victims. When the townspeople chase Knock over the countryside they appear to be tearing him apart, but the object of their frenzy turns out to be a scarecrow.The film's climax has a gentle sensuality. Instead of a phallic stake being driven through the vampire's heart, a self-sacrificing heroine holds him in her bed to ensure his death. Sex and death, blood and contamination, are the film's themes. Max Shreck's Orlok is a truly grotesque iconic figure, both frightening and moving, with his bat ears, his aquiline nose, hunched shoulders, hairless dome, flaring eyebrows, black-ringed eyes, white skin, and clawlike hands.</fullReview>

It's also hosted by David Carradine, he provides a short opening piece which seems blue screened for some reason.For those of you who were raised by wolves and haven't seen this film before, the plot follows. Knock receives a letter from Orlok. The Count wishes to buy a home in Bremen, he quickly dispatches his assistant Hutter with the necessary contracts. Thomas arrives in Transylvannia to find the Count is a frightening visage, though he first chalks up the strange happenings as bad dreams. Too late he realizes that Orlok is a vampire and the monster wants Ellen (after seeing her picture in a locket).The vampire's earth filled coffins are loaded on the ship Demeter; en route across the seas crew die one by one as he drains their life. Meanwhile, Thomas struggles to reach Ellen by land, arriving after the crewless Demeter docks. With Nosferatu's coming a plague falls upon the city, it is only when Ellen sacrifices herself that evil is banished.This version is remastered and includes the most enjoyable soundtrack I've seen it put to yet. Type O Negative's metal/Gothic songs rarely seem out of place and then only for moments. The film itself is a masterpiece, with a tidy plot and excellent makeup for Nosferatu.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nosferatu made kosher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That old silent film is of course a classic. It comes from the German school of horror films in the 1920s. It is an adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, but it takes liberties with the original. It is situated in Bremen and not in London. His girlfriend or wife is quite rightly Mina. Rensfield is the boss of the real estate agency. The trip to Dracula's castle is standard. Dracula's voyage to Bremen is also very standard. The real change comes at the end when Mina sacrifices herself by giving herself to Dracula to keep him active up to after the cock crows. Then he dies and everyone is saved. Naive rewriting of the ending into some palatable cathartic compensation of the horror of life : salvation is possible and escape is a real eventuality. But it is also a very Christian ending in a way, or isn't it Jewish after all ? The woman sacrificing herself for the sake of the social group that is menaced by Dracula. And this sacrifice is epiphanic since it brings salvation. This fantastic and horror period in the German cinema seems to be longing for a happy ending, just as if the reality of Germany then was so bleak that happiness could only be a dream and a consolation or a solace the cinema could propose to people. The film though is admirable by the quality of the pictures and the shooting. A black and white film on such a subject could easily become drab, which it never does. The pictures are always innovative in a way or another with a contrast or a composition that makes the poor technique of the days quite able to translate complex situations. The acting of these silent actors is also quite admirable in the body language they use that is never overdone which would make it grotesque. It is just expressive enough to mean what it is supposed to mean without any negative second level reading.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine &amp; University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</fullReview>

Yes, the film is trulyremarkable to remembered after all of these years, it has surely gone through a lot including being sued by Bram Stoker's widow for nothaving permission of doing the film (which is a bit ridiculous). Alas, that is why we remember this beautifully done film for its' greatness and glory, a true masterpiece. So, if you will, makers of such modern Vampire films which earn horribly in the box office anyway, watch this film and remember it for not only is it an actual movie but something that will save your career, it is a true reference.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original vampire film and most famous example of German Expressionism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nosferatu (1922) by F.W. Murnau--F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu may be the most famous example of German Expressionist film-making in the 1920s, and yet it is probably the least representative of the overall movement. The first tale of Dracula to hit the big screen, Nosferatu tells the tale of the vampire, Count Orlok, who brings terror to a village in Germany in the 1830s. The film is slowly paced in keeping with the Expressionist movement's emphasis on slow pacing to highlight nuance in the acting and detail in the mise-en-scene, but also in this case to orient the viewer to the background folklore of vampires, a mythology not in the forefront of the public consciousness in 1922. Compared to the highly distorted exaggerated sets of Expressionism's most representative film, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Nosferatu was mainly shot on location in order to emphasize the idea of the unnatural coming out of the natural, a very different notion from that of the carefully crafted, internal, emotionally subjective reality created in the mise-en-scene of most Expressionist films like Caligari. The acting of Max Schreck as Orlok is highly expressionistic, however, with his extremely distorted body movements. In fact, his acting was so unearthly for its time that many wondered if Max Schreck himself might not be a vampire as chronicled in the film Shadow of the Vampire (2000). The cinematography highlights a sense of claustrophobia through its alternating wide-shots and close-ups with scenes edited together using iris transitions. These edits complement the chamber-drama atmosphere of the tale, as do the many arches in the film, a dramatic motif to define a limited, claustrophobic space. Interestingly, whereas Caligari was a commentary on a hypnotic, but misguided power leading the passive masses to their doom in Germany in World War I, Nosferatu is a commentary on the death of the Great War. So profoundly is this film about death, that every character in some way orients himself or herself to it and establishes a relationship with death. Ideas of the supernatural and death pervade the editing together of disparate scenes, a variation of parallel editing in which two or more actions are perceived by the viewer to be taking place at the same time but there is some sort of supernatural connection between these simultaneous occurrences, such as when Hutter's wife perceives his danger at Orlok's castle when the vampire prepares to drink his blood. Ultimately, while the originator of the vampire film, and a classic of horror and silent cinema, the film's pacing is too slow for so minimal a story. As with many German expressionist films I fear that the emphasis on distorted mise-en-scene and acting betrays what is truly unique to the cinematic medium, editing. Paintings can have emotionally-subjective, distorted imagery as well as in the Expressionist paintings of Munch and Kandinsky, and many German plays in the teens displayed the overwrought performances of films like Nosferatu and Caligari, but this to me is a betrayal of what should be truly emphasized in cinema, editing. Editing is what truly differentiates the cinema from all other art forms, and is why I feel that German Expressionism with films like Nosferatu runs contrary to the soul of film-making.

		<shortDescription>Nosferatu! That name alone can chill the blood!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's incredible to view a film over eighty years old with no special effects and very little in the way of makeup inspire the kind of dread and foreboding as found in director F.W. Murnau's "Nosferatu". Max Schreck defines the title character with his skeletal features and long spider like fingers, a haunting figure that defies an earlier captioned description as a rich man who's free with his money. The mood is set early, his homeland of Transylvania is a land of phantoms where evil spirits become powerful after dark.Jonathon Harker's quest to bring Count Orlok/Nosferatu/Count Dracula back to Bremen is beset with nightmare, heralded by Harker's first meeting with the Count. There is nothing subtle about Schreck's portrayal when Harker cuts himself slicing bread, Nosferatu literally jumps at him to taste blood. When Harker examines his appearance in a mirror the following morning, the doom he is about to face appears as two trace like punctures on his neck.The film uses a number of animal symbols, but unlike the more familiar "Dracula" film of 1933, bats and wolves are missing here; instead we have an early appearance of a hyena outside Nosferatu's castle. Rats and spiders are used repeatedly, and for added measure, a lab scene in Bremen features a study of a Venus fly trap catching a fly, highlighting the "vampire" of the vegetable kingdom.The first time Harker manages a glimpse of Nosferatu in his earthen coffin aboard ship, the image offered is truly one of horror and fear, accentuated by the mere appearance of eyes and a partial face. It's repeated for added effect later on, when Harker opens a door to find a demon like, hideous visage in full form. How much is left to the imagination to see the shadow of Nosferatu climb the stairs while stalking Nina Harker? The implied terror is captured in one of the all time great images of silent film history.There are very few movies that I would consider "must see", Nosferatu falls into that category from the perspective of it's historical importance to the horror genre and it's impact on vampire lore in film. More is conveyed via menacing shadows, stark imagery and the revelation of vampire history than in reels full of many of the computer generated horror fests of present day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director: F.W. Murnau, Script: Henrik Galeen, Novel: Bram Stoker, Cast: Max Schreck(Orlok), Gustav von Waggenheim(Johannes), Greta Schroeder-Matray(Ellen).This is the ultimate vampire movie. Easily superior to the Tod Browning, Bela Lugosi version done in 1931. This has long been a favorite early horror film among fans. Murnau had difficulty producing this film due to resistance from Bram Stoker's widow. To get around this, all the character names where changed.This film is set in 1800's Germany. Johannes, a real estate man, has to leave his wife, Ellen, for a while to travel to Transylvania to sell a flat to Orlock. Orlock, of course, is the vampire and the place that he is to selling to Orlock is across the street from Johannes's place. When Orlock arrives in Bremen, their town, a plague is brought among the village. The journey that Johannes takes to get there is amazing. We are taken through beautiful country with the alps in the background. When he gets close to Orlok's, he comes to a bridge and his ride stop's there. The driver of the carriage will not go across the bridge to "the land of the phantoms". The bridge represents a change from normalcy to an eerie otherworld.This movie even by todays standards has some rather creepy moments. Orlock has a rat-like face with big front teeth and big ears. He is easily the creepiest Dracula. There is a scene where it is nighttime and Ellen gets out of bed and goes to the window to find this shadow of a figure starring into her apartment from his window across the street--very creepy. Max Schreck had such a strange persona that it was rumoured that he was a real vampire. Who am I to dispute this! He sure was convincing. This film is a fine example of the German expressionistic films that where made between the two wars. If you have no horror films from the silent era and are interested in acquiring some, this is the best place to start. Murnau and Fritz Lang was among the two best German directors of this time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the single-most disturbingly atmospheric Vampyre film of the lot. No matter how good effects get, no matter what our technologies, no matter the brilliance of our actors, this movie will always be the best Vampyre flick of all time.Rumors have always run rampant among history buffs, and fans alike. Max Schreck was "supposed" to have been an actual Vampyre. But both dis-spellers of such rumors, and fans of it, have pointed out one seemingly show-stopping point; that you're not supposed to be able to photograph or view reflections of Vampyres. Even with that stumbling block, the rumors persist.But what if the modern liberties taken recently by so many directors were already in place, hundreds of years ago? What if a Vampyre's inability to tolerate sunlight, fear of crosses, or weakness to garlic, WERE the myth? And what's left is this (rather large, I dare say) community of Beings of legend? And let's face it: a stake through the heart would kill ANYbody.This is a haunting film, if only you believe.It rates a 9.8/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Something that unfortunately seems to have been forgotten by many is that between WWI and the Third Reich, Germany made some impressive movies. The three that probably stand out the most are "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari", "Nosferatu" and "The Nibelungenlied".The second one is still the epitome of a horror movie. Obviously, it was based on Bram Stoker's classic "Dracula", but put a surreal spin on it. Max Schreck, as the title character (whose name in the movie is Count Orlok), makes a scarier Dracula than Bela Lugosi, Christopher Lee, Frank Langella or Gary Oldman. His shaved head and long fingernails emphasize his mystique. Probably the best scene is when Count Orlok is walking up a staircase; his shadow on the wall becomes a form of horror in and of itself.All in all, "Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens" is naturally a must for film historians and horror fans alike. Werner Herzog's 1979 remake was even better; they further developed the title character. And "Shadow of the Vampire" was also quite interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the first silent feature film I ever watched. At the time it was obviously a little strange as I was only used to "talkies" however Nosferatu has haunted me ever since. I don't mean to say that I wake up at night, sweating and riddled with terror ? however part of the movie stayed with me since then.Of course there are the technical aspects. Murnau had been a director for 3 years when Nosferatu was made, yet he commands the technical aspects like he'd been at it an entire lifetime. With him he has an entire toolbox full of visual devices: Deep focus (screw you Citizen Kane!), time-lapse, stop motion, shadow-plays, low angles, etc. And then there's the cutting? compared to other movies made at the same time, the movie is actually cut quite fast. However it's not cut chronologically and some of the things make little sense seen only in the context of the story. For instance we are shown a random scene of a professor showing his students a flytrap when none of the characters features before or after. The narration is truly impeccable and entirely unique. It adds up better as a dream than as a story... Now the story, that's a peculiar case? It's an adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula which wasn't all that known back then. So the production team simply got at it without acquiring the rights. They changed a few names and settings, omitted a few characters and then went on to work with the story which stayed largely the same (one of the major differences is the ending of course). As it stands it's really simple: Graf Orlock (aka. Nosferatu) orders a guy named Hutter to his castle to sell him a house in Wisborg (a fictional German city). Hutter goes there but is captured by Nosferatu who travels to Wisborg and takes at Hutter's wife (obviously this is omitting some major plot points). While the movie resonated well with critics and audiences at the time, there was one major problem - Bram Stoker's widow was yet alive and apparently she wasn't very amused so she dragged the production company, Prana-Film, to court. Nosferatu became their first and last film and it was ordered to be destroyed. However that effort ultimately proved to be pointless as the film existed in too many copies already. So the film remained, Bram Stoker's novel received renewed interest (ultimately leading to a stage adaptation and the Lugosi film in 1931), Murnau became a big name and Prana-Film vanished.People like to talk about Nosferatu in relation to expressionism. Of course it makes sense given the cinematic movement at the time (German expressionism), Schreck's makeup, the dark theme, the connections to nature (e.g. the aforementioned flytrap) and Murnau's use of shadows. However personally I think it links much, much better to romanticism. For Nosferatu Murnau used mainly natural settings, shooting mostly on location (he even went as far as Slovakia for the exterior shots of Transylvania). He uses wide establishing shots, showing us nature which is either void of humans or renders them insignificantly small. The entire movie is in vein of a strangely melancholic mood that culminates whenever Murnau (a former art student) copies the paintings of Caspar David Friedrich (one of the leading painters in romanticism and a personal favorite) in still shots (Consider Friedrich's Moonrise at the Sea and Hutter's wife, Ellen, waiting for him by the sea, Friedrich's Woman at the Window and the symmetric shot of Ellen opening the window or Friedrich's The Abbey in the Oakwood and Nosferatu's destroyed castle at the end). Although Nosferatu is (in my opinion) the most terrifying portrayal of Dracula, it's also possibly the most daring, complex and human. The movie stresses nature (as evident in the large establishing shots) and above all doing as one's nature bids one. The movie shows arrays of living creatures (wolfs, horses, rats, flytraps, flies, spiders, cats and even bacteria, amplified by a microscope). They all do as their nature bids them, the wolf stalks horses, the spider devours its prey and the flytrap eats flies? If we relate this to Nosferatu, what is he? The manifestation of evil or merely an outsider who doesn't fit in by nature? Given he's a vampire him sucking blood is only natural. He follows that urge that defines him - and he dies. He dies by the sunlight, he can't withstand. Is this a "happy end"? Is it a tragedy? Is it neither? Personally I found the death to be very sad: The sun shines through and Nosferatu clutches to his heart and slowly dissolves into nothingness. It is debated whether or not Bram Stoker was gay. We're certain about Murnau. Given the disdain for homosexuals at the time, I think the ambivalence is very much intended.If you look beyond the shadows you might see something beautiful - Nosferatu is one of the most visionary examples of artistic realization I have ever witnessed and maybe the best horror movie of all time ? 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Great and a Huge Milestone of Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not going to be a long review. In fact, consider it less of a review and more a bundling together of observations I had while watching the classic silent horror film Nosferatu.It is strange how this became the most recognized and the greatest of all classic Dracula films without even officially featuring Dracula. The Germans that made this film were unable to secure the rights to Stoker's novel, so they just changed a few names and made the film anyways. Normally, this results in a cheap, bargain-basement product. But every now and then it results in a classic, like this here.It is also to blame for many of the traits about Dracula that date back to the novel, such as that he is killed by sunlight. Far more people feel this movie's influence than have ever watched it, which is a shame, since it is one of the best movies of its decade, elegantly shot and stirringly scored.There is a reason that this film is subtitled A Symphony of Terror. You aren't just watching a visual display, you are given a feast for the ears. One of the best scores in film accompanies this film; one that makes this film feel less like a broad form of entertainment and more like a piercing symphony, with notes instead of swords. Certainly, there was more emphasis on music in the old days in film. Be prepared if you haven't watched before a film from this time.The use of chromatic filters has always been one of my favorite techniques, and its use in this film helps maintain a flowing, even turn that never stagnates. The colors are not harsh, but you feel its effects fully.As for the cinematography, there a number of shots that stick out to this reviewer. Among them are many simple shots, such as the ones of the castle in the daytime, the one zooming up to the ship carrying Count Orloc (Dracula), and the one of the seas being looked out at by the wistful love interest.One thing I can say for this film that I cannot say for others is that it is classy. It may give up some scare-points for it, but it revels in the high horror mythos, using a refined and efficient touch. Most of the terror of the film is implied; best for the restriction-heavy decade in which it was made, but also for foreshadowing and anticipation. Many films try to keep their secrets from you, not letting you know what happens. This film doesn't; you know what will happen and it is by such that the film is scary; dramatic irony is in full effect here. What is perhaps most remarkable is that it does it without being dragged down by a general sense of boredom and slowness; it is calculating and maneuverable, like a snake slithering through the midnight sky. This film does not fall into clichs; it sets the clichs for films to come. That is an impressive feat.This is not a perfect movie; many of the plot holes of other horror movies were also passed down from this one. If the film was faster paced, it would be alright, but as it is, counting on those beats to carry tension, it often instead makes you ask questions. But to seriously attempt to degrade this film is a bit like throwing stones against a monolith. Such flaws are nothing compared to what this film authored. It may not be the best film ever, but it is brimming with ambition and beauty and is anyway one of the most important films ever made.Thanks to a recent recovery project, this film can now be watched in full; so grab your horse and ride into the call of the deathbird.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: German Filmmaker F. W. Murnau's Epic Tale of Endless Horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nosferatu is a 1922 silent Gothic horror film directed by legendary German filmmaker, Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau. F. W. Murnau?a prominent figure in the German expressionist movement of the 1920s?is widely regarded as one of the most influential filmmakers of the silent era. Nosferatu, also known as Nosferatu?A Symphony of Horror, stars Max Schreck as the vampire Count Orlok. Murnau's Nosferatu was supposed to be an adaptation of Bram Stoker's 1897 epic vampire extravaganza, Dracula, but after the studio failed to procure the rights of the book from Stoker's widow, the names and other details were deliberately adjusted so as to avoid the hassles of copyright infringement. However, this deviation was not enough to deceive the court, which gave its verdict in the favor of Stoker's widow. After the film studio (Prana Film) declared its bankruptcy, the court instructed to destroy all the existing prints of Nosferatu. If it wouldn't have been for the one surviving copy of the film, which had already been distributed all around the world, we would have surely been deprived of the privilege of savoring this true gem of cinema.What makes Murnau's Nosferatu remarkable, in comparison to the countless other renditions, is that apart from keeping the eerie feeling of Stoker's Dracula intact it also succeeds in doing away with the theatrical gimmicks (that can offer tear apart an entire narrative), thus relying heavily on the development of its characters as well as its plot. This enriches Murnau's characters with an inherent sense of realism that the characters in the book's other cinematic renditions are so ostentatiously devoid of. Max Schreck's Count Orlok, in exact contract to the character's future portrayals on the celluloid, is what he is supposed to be: a cursed creature depraved by centuries of hapless suffering and solitude, who obviously lacks the glamour of a celebrated vampire being made to bask in the glory of his own grandeur.One vampire movie that comes very close to Murnau's Nosferatu in its expression of horro is E. Elias Merhige's metafiction horror film, Shadow of the Vampire (2000). The movie, coincidentally, shares a more intimate relation with Nosferatu, for it narrates a fictionalized account of the filming of Murnau's 1922 epic. The movie stars John Malkovich as F. W. Murnau and Willem Dafoe as Count Orlok. The beauty of Merhige's Shadow of the Vampire is that it serves two different purposes at the same time: It triumphantly presents a fictionalized account of the making of Nosferatu. And, it also serves to be a Gothic horror film of its own. Malkovich's Murnau comes across as a meticulous filmmaker who seems so obsessed about his art that he wouldn't think twice about sacrificing his cast and crew members in order to fulfill his artistic vision. Dafoe's Count Orlok is an actor so committed to his act that he wouldn't leave a single stone unturned in order to bring the Gothic vampire to life. While Dafoe's masterful performance resonates with Max Schreck's iconic portrayal, John Malkovich's F. W. Murnau has all the qualities of becoming the cinematic archetype of a mad artist obsessed with his art.Over the last nine decades, Nosferatu has not only enjoyed a strong cult following, but has received overwhelmingly positive reviews. Renowned film critic Roger Ebert writes in his review of Nosferatu, "To watch F.W. Murnau's 'Nosferatu'' is to see the vampire movie before it had really seen itself. Here is the story of Dracula before it was buried alive in clichs, jokes, TV skits, cartoons and more than 30 other films. The film is in awe of its material. It seems to really believe in vampires." Over the years, Stoker's Count Dracula has enjoyed an unprecedented following, one that is matched only by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's super-sleuth, Sherlock Holmes, with Stoker's Gothic super-villain making a major appearance in more than 200 films. Suffice it is to say that the universal popularity of Stoker's Dracula owes a colossal debt to Murnau's Nosferatu, which not only made Stoker's epic vampire saga a household phenomenon, but also immortalized Stoker's vampire as the supreme symbol of Gothic terror in the world of cinema. Even today, Murnau's Nosferatu serves as a great means to get acquainted with Stoker's timeless tale of terror. Nosferatu still continues to be unparalleled in its demonstration of unrestrained terror in the world of cinema. An essential watch!(This review was first published at A Potpourri of Vestiges)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the granddaddy of every horror movie and one of the best. Seriously, it's still scary, well-made and enjoyable. Max Schreck plays one of the greatest villains ever. No emotions, no motivations, no introspection, just a freaky living corpse sucking your blood.The flaws are little and rare, the only bad thing is overacting. But this was great and probably really scary for the '20s.F.W. Murnau is a true cinema master and probably Nosferatu is his masterpiece. And - my opinion - probably the movie with the bast vampire teeth ever.Aniway, this movie actually introduced the fact that vampires burn exposed at sunlight. And i have to say Orlok is better than Lugosi's Dracula.I recommend you the colorized 1995 and 2005 versions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My most favorite vampire film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always like to plug this film in more than any other in the vampire genre. The atmosphere just draws me in with the shades of black and white acting as the color scheme, allowing me to focus on the film and not be distracted by random colors. The vampire's design is so haunting, the silence of the piece helps with the vampire's mystique, leaving only his movements to provide the chills.A few negatives I have with this film is firstly, the music. My copy of the film uses an organ to provide the sound. It is bit repetitive but it does the job for me. Others I have watched have used totally unfitting or just annoying scores. The characters get really no development in my opinion, and I just don't care about them. It could be a fault of the medium at the time or I'm just missing it.The film is definitely a must watch, especially with the right score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nosferatu is a 1922 German film directed by F.W. Murnau, written by Henrik Galeen, and starring Max Schreck, Gustav von Wangenheim, and Greta Schrder.Liked it, didn't love it. There are so many times during horror films when I think of a smarter plan of action than the characters did, and this movie was just the same.&nbsp;I totally understand that it is a classic, and it definitely deserves to be. It's important to note the time this movie came from while critiquing it. Things in the film that may seem amateur now were ground-breaking back then. The film unfolded in a somewhat confusing manner. Something I've noticed about watching these earlier films is that the pacing is strange. It will be moving incredibly slow and/or including scenes that weren't really necessary, and then things that should take a long time happen in a snap with no explanation. I know that's vague but when watching, be prepared for seemingly random behavior stemming from somewhat ambiguous motives. I thought I was having difficulty suspending disbelief, but you can only blame it on that so many times before you have to accept that the film just isn't filling in all the blanks. It was successful in creeping me out, that's for sure. Interesting enough but I did find myself ready for it to be over a while before it actually was. It has awesome special effects for 1922. There were interesting, creative angles. It is a classic for a reason, definitely, and I'll recommend it, I guess. Bechdel test: 0/1 Did not pass. Only one female character and her sole reason for existence was to worry about her husband and be in utter despair. Did I enjoy it? Yes. 1/1 Do I ever want to see it again? I would watch it again, yes. Do I ever want to include it in my own collection? It's already included but I don't think I would intend to buy it if it wasn't. 7/10 Bye love you -Jessie Carlson</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first Dracula horror movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Nosferatu" is a horror movie which was an unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker's "Dracula" with some changes because of rights, so they changed the names and from "vampire" became "Nosferatu" and "Count Dracula" became "Count Orlok". But the plot and also the storyline is about the same as we know it nowadays.I have to admit that even though this is an old movie I liked it because it is considered one of the must see horror movies in order to understand the history of horror. This movie maybe is considered as a just old horror movie that can not give you anything but I have to disagree with this opinion and for instance I have to say that this movie can give you a lot. Some of them are that this movie was the idea of vampires to be killed by sunlight and of course this movie was the start of horror movies in that times.Finally I believe that "Nosferatu" is a movie that everyone has to watch because through this you can have a historic lesson about cinema and of course horror. I have also to prepare you not to have any visual expectations from this movie or plenty of action but instead of this it has much of suspense. Also you have to take into consideration that this movie is about one hundred years old, so do not judge it hardly and also do not judge it before watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Creepy After All These Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Allow me to start off by saying that Nosferatu is a complete, shameless rip-off of Dracula. Sure, the vampire's name has been changed, and the story moved from London to Bremen, but the plot and many of the characters remain the same. Bram Stoker's widow actually sued the filmmakers for copyright infringement, securing a court order that all copies of the film be destroyed. We are fortunate today that a handful of prints survived. Sure, Nosferatu may be a rip-off, but it's still one heck of a horror movie.The movie does have some very real problems. Although the filmmakers had one of the great novels of the previous century to work with, the problems of adapting it into a screenplay, together with the constraints inherent to all silent films medium, mean that some plot points never become all the way clear. There is also a bit of Bad Exposition Syndrome involving the film's solution. And although Professor Van Helsing appears, he never actually confronts the villain.But the issues are more than made up for by Nosferatu's sheer creepiness. Conrad Viet (?) playing the title role, sports one of the all time great horror movie makeup jobs. His pointed ears, completely bald head, narrow cheekbones, and bushy eyebrows give him an aspect that is terrible to behold. His hands are oversized, with his fingers narrowing into long claws. And forget the standard pair of fangs; all of his teeth are needle sharp, and his mouth is absolutely packed with them.This eeriness extends to practically every other aspect of the film as well. The Transylvanian castle fills the viewer with foreboding from the moment it is first seen, and the darkly lit halls and corridors within are no less disquieting. Even more menacing is the ruined manor in Bremen. Every window is broken, part of the roof is collapsed, and indeed it seems that at any moment the entire structure could come crashing down.The special effects are also worth noting. Although crude by today's standards, there is still something frightening about seeing doors open and close on their own, or coffin lids floating through the air. We know that these sights can't be real; the jerkiness of the movements tells us that something is up. But the incompleteness of the illusion only adds to the feeling that something is not right, heightening our sense of apprehension.Great advances in production values have taken place since this film was made, and I admit that Todd Browning's Dracula, made only a decade later, had much better plot and characterization. But Nosferatu is still the one of the most frightening movies I've ever seen, able to give even the hardiest of audiences nightmares. And if it can still have this effect today, just imagine what it must have been like for people watching this in 1921. It's not hard to picture many a burgher making their way home through the dark, narrow streets of Berlin or Munich, convinced that their every step was shadowed by an immortal being that lived only to suck the very life out of them, and to? You're not reading this in the dark are you?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Silent Symphony of Count Doorlock...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this one just this morning, I happened to be in the company of my niece's son, Louie. To make NOSFERATU interesting enough to hold the attention of a five-year-old, I resorted to doing the voices of the various characters (Peter Lorre and Edward G. Robinson lent their respective distinctive voices to the film). At one point, I thought I'd lost the kid: he picked up a pair of action figures and started playing with them. Then he looked up, just in time to see Max Schreck as Count Orlock walking toward the camera. "It's Count Doorlock," he said. And so it will ever be. NOSFERATU still holds up, after nearly a hundred years: the use of negative images to lend an air of unreality to the proceedings (the coach ride to Castle Doorlock) is still a neat little trick, as was what was apparently the use of a mirror to suggest a ghostly apparition (Count Doorlock, seen by a ship's crewman sick with "fever") and Doorlock's Horizontal to Vertical rise, done without so much as the bending of a single limb. The whole notion of a vampire "plague" is still viable (and the analogy still so apt) that it's being used on television (THE STRAIN) and in print (THE NIGHT RIDERS, an xlibris book).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The scariest film of all-time for Max Schreck alone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My choice for the scariest horror film ever made (with considerable honourable mention to Ridley Scott's Alien) is the quintessential vampire film ? F. W. Murnau's Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens. Made in 1922, its age is part of the reason why it's so strikingly horrific. It feels all the more tangible and eerie, especially due to it being shot on location rather than a soundstage. It doesn't offer shock horror that we're so used to and desensitized from these days, given its silence, but instead incites an overwhelming sense of unease. Is there anything more convincingly ghastly than Max Schreck as Count Orlok? A substitute here for Bram Stoker's famous Dracula due to rights issues, but a character that is no less a part of pop culture.The figure of the vampire seems to be no longer one of horror. Saturated and romanticized over recent years of PG-13 young adult films, not to mention an abundance of parodies, Schreck's performance however still stands tall as an iconic monument in monster movies. Perhaps it is due to the nature of the character in this context. Klaus Kinski almost meets Schreck's match in Herzog's 1979 Nosferatu remake (it takes a lot to claim that Kinski has been outdone in the scary faces department), and Willem Dafoe's committed portrayal of the actor in the mediocre Shadow of a Vampire is one of the greatest performances of all-time in its own right.While myths perpetuated in the aforementioned film wherein Schreck is believed to be so convincing as a vampire because he is one are easy to shake off, he does indeed bring an otherworldly atmosphere. Even when he does nothing in the frame but stand, the film has a crippling tension in his enigmatic mystery. His grotesque rat-like makeup with his pointed ears and bulky nose, his tall rigid intimidating figure, the claws of his hands and nails, and the hollowness of his face are all pure nightmare fuel. Even his silhouette sends shivers down my spine. Schreck uses the tool of his body impeccably to create a sense of perpetual menace.Its most haunting scene comes just passed the midway point when the film's protagonist has escaped from the vampire's castle and Orlok slowly follows him via a ship transporting coffins. The image of Orlok springing out of a coffin is chilling. As he kills off the sailors, which is later blamed on the plague, it suggests a sinister omniscience and omnipotence about him that previous scenes couldn't implicate, and it hints at the crushing inevitability of death.Even so, it isn't as overtly expressionistic as other German films of the time, especially Murnau's own films, but that restraint only makes it more generous to the actors and the story. The simplicity of the iconic frames of looming shadows is enough to withstand 92 years. The film outside of Schreck is still quite notable, in its storytelling ideas (it was the first vampire film to suggest that they could be killed by sunlight) and penetrating themes of fear, narcissism, sexuality and death. Nosferatu is as thoughtful as it is unsettling. I was lucky to see it with a live orchestra two years ago and that experience has stayed with me since. An essential horror film.Read more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com/)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any critic would elect this movie the masterpiece of expressionist cinema. Beyond the definitions, any viewer can not help but consider it a series of pictures at an exhibition, harbingers of horrific suggestions beyond the capabilities of Friederich and Munch. Max Schreck will probably be remembered as the Nosferatu closer to the figure of the vampire that has ever appeared on the screens, so as to suggest (to some) that Murnau had a real vampire playing the role. It seems then that Schreck was his real last name, curious twist of fate, since it means "Terror" in German! Although the names of the characters from the novel "Dracula" by Bram Stoker were all changed, the director was sued by Stoker's heirs and lost the lawsuit. Returning to the movie, even if seen in a cut version (missing half an hour) it is a timeless masterpiece, and I think that instead of staying here to hear me talk about it you should go and see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dracula without the clichs or the terror - 58%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following on from that legendary silent movie "Metropolis", I decided to take a punt on "Nosferatu" which is probably the earliest adaption of Bram Stoker's "Dracula" in existence. Indeed, it was a bit too close to the source material and it forced Stoker's estate to sue the studio behind "Nosferatu" which ultimately put them out of business. As part of the settlement, the courts ordered all prints of the film to be destroyed but one copy survived, having previously been shipped overseas. As such, it is a miracle that "Nosferatu" can be seen today at all although it does lack the epic scale and grandeur of Fritz Lang's seminal picture. Bear in mind that the version I saw had the characters name changed to fit the source novel but I shall stick to the cast's titles to avoid confusion.Sinister German estate agent Knock (Alexander Granach) dispatches his protg Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim) to the distant Carpathian mountains to meet with a client, Count Orlok (Max Schreck). The Count is interested in buying a ramshackle mansion in the town opposite Hutter's house where he lives with his wife Ellen (Greta Schrder) and Hutter is there to seal the deal - despite the locals warning him about the Count and begging him not to go. When he gets there, he quickly discovers that Orlok is a vampire and flees to return to Wisborg as soon as he can. But Orlok is already there, growing in strength and choosing his next victim - Ellen...By today's standards, "Nosferatu" is all rather tame as there is none of the usual frippery we get with a Dracula film - no crashing lightning storms, no garlic or crucifixes and definitely no Christopher Lee. It's more creepy than it is frightening but remains an essential watch of fans of bloodsuckers. Schreck does a fine job beneath a truly disturbing and grotesque visage, coming across like a Dracula we've rarely seen since. Beyond that, the film is pretty much your typical piece of German Expressionism - lots of heavy eye make-up, dialogue cards and melodramatic acting. The soundtrack of the version I watched also grated on the nerves, starting off with lots of harpsichord but quickly becoming repetitive and soon fading from the ears altogether. But to criticise "Nosferatu" is missing the point - it feels like it should be in a museum, creaking through the projector and looking like it might fall apart at any moment. Judging it by todays' standards is futile but it remains an experience to savour for genuine fans of horror and cinema in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nosferatu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>F.W. Murnau set the bar high for vampire movies, very high. Can not help but start praising the job Max Schreck and Murnau did to bring Count Orlok character to life on the screen. Orlok's face, hands and slender build along with his sly shuffling movements with the right camera angles and props brought a hell of a lot of general creepiness. The viewers in the twenties must have been shell shocked because they didn't tame it down which they most often did in this time period. For a full length silent feature film I found the time going fairly fast with a view dragged out scenes, that can be expected. The big bugaboo I have with Nosferatu though is the questionable ending being terribly anticlimactic. Regardless of the disappointing ending, Nosferatu is a killer film that is a must watch for horror or classic movie fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It will cost you sweat and tears, and perhaps... a little blood."I would probably give this film 5 stars if I were to base it on appreciation for how it influenced many films during the silent era and served as a landmark for the horror genre. F.W. Murnau played a key role in the German Expressionist movement and Nosferatu is one of its greatest examples. This movement went on to influence other great directors such as Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock especially in the way they played with shadows and lighting to express the emotions of their characters and enhance the mood of their films. This silent film might have scared audiences in the 20's, but it is really outdated and I struggled to maintain my interest in the story. I have to give it credit for shaping modern horror films today and also influencing the film noir genre, but no matter how much I appreciate it, Nosferatu was far from entertaining for me. One of my favorite things about this film was Count Orlok's makeup which was really creepy, along with how Murnau used the lighting and played with shadows to build the suspense. Those moments were great, but the story really didn't lead up to much and Orlok got very little screen time. I'd personally recommend watching those brief scenes instead of sitting through the entire film. The film uses a lot of title cards and they leave them on screen for so long you could practically read everything twice. There is no denying this was a masterpiece, but I had a hard time sticking with it.The screenplay was written by Henrik Galeen, heavily stealing from its source material, Bram Stoker's novel, Dracula. In Nosferatu we are first introduced to a real estate agent named Knock (Alexander Granach) who is sending his associate, Hutter (Gustav von Wagenheim) to Count Orlak's (Max Schreck) castle in Transylvania. Orlak is looking to buy a house in Wisbourg, and Knock is considering selling him the home next to Hutter's. Hutter realizes this is a great opportunity to make some money so he leaves his wife, Ellen (Greta Schrder), with some friends while he embarks on the long journey. Along the way several people warn him about the strange events that occur at night near Orlak's castle, but he continues on. Once he reaches the castle, he has an awkward conversation with Orlak and when he accidentally cuts his finger he realizes that Orlak is in fact a Nosferatu (vampire). When Orlak sees a picture of Ellen he quickly decides to buy the new home and is shipped to Wisbourg in a coffin. On the way back several crew members of the ship mysteriously die and some sort of plague seems to have reached the city. Hutter and Ellen know what's really going on, but the question is whether or not they can stop this evil creature.Nosferatu is all about the eerie atmosphere that Murnau managed to create with a very low budget. It turned away from the standard action-adventure and comedy films of the silent era by creating something unique and exploring such emotions as fear and suspense. Most contemporary horror films probably have to credit Murnau for being a landmark film and setting the stage for them. Nosferatu is a Gothic stylized film that has influenced the way we view cinema today so we owe Murnau a lot of gratitude for his work. Unfortunately films are subjective and despite my appreciation for this film I did not enjoy it as much as other film lovers. I did like the cast and the editing however, but the pacing of the film was what I had issues with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Max Schreck saves Nosferatu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nosferatu is a film I had wanted to see for awhile. All the clips of Max Schreck as Count Orlock was amazing to say the least, the use of shadow was also incredible, it seemed like such a different take on Dracula. But it isn't, its just the typical Dracula story and the fact that its a 90 minutes but only has Schreck in it for a tenth of that doesn't help.The 90 minutes is a problem. Dracula (1931) with Bela Lugosi was 70 minutes and it told its story far better. 'Well it had sound' you may say, well Nosferatu may as well be a sound film because I remember spending quite a bit of time reading during the film. I understand silent films needed title cards to explain the story but if it becomes a detriment to the pace and well being of the film then you have a problem, either trim the story to better fit the lack of sound or just don't make the film. The film just isn't interesting enough to fill its 90 minutes and halfway through, you get bored and just stop reading the title cards, so if you haven't seen any other version of Dracula, the story isn't going to make as much sense to you. The film practically shot itself in the foot here.The lack of Schreck is another problem. While his small appearances throughout the film does make his character all the more mysterious and terrifying, it makes the other 75 or so minutes painfully boring because you're either reading or watching something that isn't as interesting as watching Schreck. Schreck is fantastic as Count Orlock, his unnatural appearance, movements and almost expressionless face is truly a compliment to how terrifying a monster can be with no voice. Sadly, they do give him a voice, he is a god damn gentle man if the title cards are anything to go by, with such horrifying lines as 'What a lovely throat', why would you give a character as horrifying as Orlock such cheesy lines. It just takes away all the mystery and frankly makes him less scary.F.W. Murnau may have made a flawed film but his eye for detail is incredible. His use of shadow is so effective, he manages to convey things no title card could ever convey in words and its a real shame he didn't inject more of this creativity into the rest of the film. The music is very good as well, blending in well with the films tone and its cinematography.Overall, I wish I could say better things about Nosferatu, but its simply to flawed to ignore. I recommend it to any fan of the horror genre because it is a landmark film in the genre and the performance from Schreck and Murnau's fantastic cinematography are deserved of all the praise in the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gem of early horror, but its setting can sometimes vary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clarification is required ? when we talk about this film, we are talking about three different things: a discrete work of art, a cultural phenomenon and a viewing experience. Murnau's film, which was made in 1922 and in many ways shows it, is the beginning of vampire films. Working with less precedence than all the horror film directors who followed him, Murnau helped shape the horror genre with choices that he made in presenting this story. Many of these still work very well, including the spooky shadow-on-the-wall sequence and the horizontal-to-vertical rise of the vampire from his coffin.Your enjoyment of this film, however, will not be determined solely by what Murnau did. Instead, it will be influenced by a number of factors. From a personal point of view, it will have to do with how you feel about vampire films in general, with whether you've seen the Herzog/Kinski 1979 version of this film(which is absolutely wonderful), and with how your version of this classic is presented to you. In my case, for instance, I had to endure what was a truly horrible modern music soundtrack that Eureka Video felt entitled to inflict upon its customers, and clumsily translated intertitles as well. Were I to have seen this with better music (and it's hard to imagine that worse music could be found) and better translations of the original German caption-boards, I would have been spared some pain.However, these minor quibbles aside, the film is beautiful. The camera angles are innovative, the images are stunning, and although Gustav von Wangenheim as the Jonathan Harker wannabe Thomas Hutter is not a great actor, the rest of the cast, including Greta Schrder as his wife, Alexander Granach as the Renfield clone named Knock and, of course, Max Schreck (his name in German actually means "fright" or "fear") as Count Orlok are all brilliant in their roles. As for exterior locations, the quaint Hanseatic towns of Lbeck and Wismar give the film added authenticity and period charm.Is it scary? Well, not so much today, but it's not really the fault of this film that we have come to recognise every convention it uses. After all, most of them are original to this film and have themselves been copied in the subsequent iterations that we've seen. and in any case, even where it is not scary, it remains deeply eerie. Is this film good? Very definitely yes, although on a personal level, if you asked me about early atmospheric films regarding vampires, I would have to admit that I prefer Carl Theodor Dreyer's "Vampyr", filmed ten years later in 1932. Still, considering the advances made in the intervening decade, Murnau's earlier film is an incredible accomplishment. And Max Schreck, who would come back, thanks to Willem Dafoe, some seventy-eight years later to become an equally haunting if somewhat funnier character in E. Elias Merhige's "Shadow of the Vampire", creates a horror archetype here that we have been living ? and dying ? with ever since.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Max Schreck's Indelible Performance Highlights Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Expressionist film was released in theaters 90 years ago, and its essential ability to scare people has not been diminished. Two people deserve credit for this accomplishment. The director, F.W. Murnau, captured a foreboding world behind the lens by the strong use of shadows and his keen ability to tell a story. The other person is Max Schreck, whose makeup and portrayal as the vampire continue to haunt people to this very day. I still find it hard to believe that his total screen time is less than 10 minutes. This is a testament to his strong screen presence. The film would not work without him.NOSFERATU is an adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula and the plot is very familiar to horror fans. The filmmakers did not receive permission from Stoker's widow, and as a result, some of the characters' names are changed. For example, Dracula became Orlok and Renfield became Knock. However, the plot was basically the same and she later sued because of copyright infringement. Anyway, the protagonist of the film is Thomas Hutter who works as a real estate employee. His boss, Knock, sends him to a Castle in the Carpathian Mountains. He must sell a house to the mysterious Count Orlok. Just by coincidence, the house for sale is next to Hutter's house in the German village. Hutter soon realizes that Orlok is a vampire after being attacked. The vampire rushes off to his newly purchased home, which is in ruin. He will spread a plague in the once peaceful village while attempting to defile Hutter's wife. Hutter must try to get back in time to protect the love of his life.A creepy atmosphere pervades the entire film. There is always a feeling of dread. The story is simple yet very effective. I always fear for Hutter because of his predicament. When he leaves the peaceful village and beautiful wife, Hutter has no idea what terror soon awaits him. In my mind, there is nothing scarier than being isolated in an ancient castle with a malevolent vampire. I could easily sense how alone Hutter truly was during his stay in the castle. After subsequent viewings, I can always feel the impending dangers as Hutter first sets out on his journey. Somewhere in the far distance there is a vampire awaiting his company.The film does have flaws. Some of the acting is exaggerated and laughable by today's standards, but you have to consider the time. The pacing is slow and may bore some people who do not appreciate silent films. You really need to have some patience and watch the film in the right frame of mind.If someone were watching this film for the first time, I would recommend finding a decent DVD release. This film has fallen into the public domain and there are some inferior prints out there. For advice on acquiring the best copy, you can visit the message board here and read different opinions. I also recommend the Werner Herzog remake from 1979, which I believe is a superior film. However, even though Klaus Kinski does a fine job of playing the infamous vampire, he cannot compete with Schreck's performance.P.S. According to the trivia section on this website, Max Schreck makes a cameo as a clerk without any makeup in Renfield's office towards the beginning. Hutter is seen talking to the clerk shortly before going into Renfield's office. In some prints, the man raises his head, in others he does not. This supposed cameo has been debated among horror aficionados, and while there is no official source for this, I believe that it is Schreck. Go watch and decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a very young person relative to this film, I first heard of Nosferatu through Spongebob Squarepants in their funny horror episode. That was years ago. Finally I got around to seeing this classic horror. What can I say about it? It was OK.As a loose adaptation of Dracula, the film's plot cuts out a lot of the story and adds a little. No Van Helsing or Lucy-alikes, shortened sequences of... everything, but with the additions of Knock, an ending I liked, and a great boat scene.The music in the version I saw was great, one of the best parts. I believe it was composed by James Bernard, and it was excellent. As said before, the other things I enjoyed were the boat scene, left ambiguous in the 'Dracula' I read, but shown here in the film, with the scariest results in the film. Also, the ending, was a heroic sacrifice, even though it didn't make much sense. Also, Max Schreck's menacing Nosferatu is just iconic.I didn't find the film the most engaging though, and some unnecessary things were put in. The film is short and cuts out a lot, but leaves in irrelevant things. At 90 years old, the films has aged worse than even other silent films. It's a classic horror fans should see, or if it's on you should see it just for kicks. Just don't expect to get your socks knocked off like it's 1922. 7.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Certainly not Murneau's Best Film, but his most Daring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would give "Nosferatu" a 7. Why? Because out of all the films that predate it, Nosferatu comes of age. But we must respect the fact it pertains to a medieval tradition and some flaws can be found outside when you actually see Max Shreck outside in the sun light. More a nitpick then anything on Murneau's masterwork. What made me like it so much? Well out of all the macabre films that have launched in the genre, this one had more layers and had well executed performances; it was actually shot in the Carpathian mountains, it infused the Monster (Frankenstein's Monster)'s pathos with the Vampire's lust for blood and the film chronicles epidemic more in earnestly then most films (only thwarted by "Vampyr" and Coppola's "Dracula" in terms of serious approach).Nosferatu uses atmosphere to capture the viewer's reverie for nightmarish figures. Knock is a character who has been driven from sanity to madness as the disseminating epidemic takes its toll. It took Bram Stoker's novel and Murneau explicated how he could translate it with subtlety. The answer was substitute the name (now well seeded in folklore) and create jagged and prismatic architecture to change the story ultimately. It's fair to say the film doesn't really have an all encompassing narrative, though it does encompass narrative POVs. There's a famous key scene when Orlock's shadow engulfs Hutter and it's seen from a Woman dying in her bed. The scene is so lurid and so resonant that it doesn't matter about movies like "Saw", "Halloween" (brilliant notwithstanding) and "Friday the 13th" when the director gives your imagination enough fulcrum.It was bodacious no doubt even with the notable flaws that we can dismiss. Undoubtedly it's probably the most sterling horror movie ever made. I.e. when Hutter comes to the mountains he's completely lost. His time being lost gives us enough to soak up the gorgeously Stygian and cavernous world, much like how Allan Grey soaks it up 10 years later in Vampyr. It's only abruptly that Orlock interjects and stipulates that Hutter must come here. Not exactly a congenial acquaintance as the ravishing Bela Lugosi, but a shunned ogre-esque creature who besotted company. Then another scene, which looks almost like stop-frame animation, where Orlock moves rigidly to the coffin to make it up and then wields it as if like Jesus carrying the cross. I'm not saying this was intentional symbolism, but the impression is so sacrosanct that it starts to feel cogent.Like with most silents of greatness, some may not respond to it concordantly. We must remember though that for its time, it had brilliantly archaic element, like "The Cabinet of Dr Caligari", which remain artistic. Although I must admit I have seen many other amazing silents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silent classic with the unforgettable rodent face Max Schrenk as the most horrifying of all screen vampires</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This expressionist German milestone called Nosferatu-Eine Symphonie Des Grauens -Nosferatu a Symphony of Horror- turns out to be a hit in the history of world cinema and especially in terror cinema . It deals with newlyweds named Jonathan and Lucy Harker who are saddened when Harker is sent to Transylvania by employer Renfield to arrange for Count Dracula's purchase of a house across the street from the Harkers' house. Harker travels to Transylvania where he stays with the Count , is sucked by the Count, and eventually escapes from the castle. Jonathan returns to Lucy but spends all his time sitting on a chair in the living room. Nosferatu moves into the house across from the Harkers' and goes to Bremen in a ship called Demeter . The rise in deaths is accredited to a plague thought to have arrived with the Demeter. Only a woman can break his frightfull spell , a woman pure in heart who offer her blood freely to Nosferatu and will keep the vampire by his side until the cook crowed . As the vampire meets his doom when Lucy manages to keep him until after cockcrow.This German all time classic silent horror-movie from 1922 is a captivating and eerie experience with creepy images , imaginative sets and exciting touches . Max Schreck is perfect as Nosferatu with his rat face, long nails , pointed ears and skeletal frame . The story brilliantly conveys the loneliness , despair sadness of the characters .The landscape is moody and lovely and the sets are gorgeous as well as creepy , especially the phantom castle of The Count , the ship and Bremen town . The slow, somewhat exaggerated reactions of his characters brilliantly echo the performances given by the silent actors . One day, the great Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau was talking with Max Reinhardt. Reinhardt introduced Schreck to Murnau. Murnau saw talent in Schreck and hired him to play Graf (Count) Orlok in the fledgling Prana Film's first production, "Nosferatu; Eine Symphonie Des Grauens" -Nosferatu; A Symphony Of Horror- .The regards to Max Schreck are a mystery, he made a few pictures and we don't know anything about his life. His performance as the bald, bat-eared, close fanged Orlok remains one of the most frightening film characters in history . This brilliantly eerie motion picture is originally and compellingly directed by F.W. Murnau .This vampire masterpiece is remade in 1979 titled Nosferatu the Vampyre by Werner Herzog with Klaus Kinski ,Bruno Ganz and Isabelle Adjnani in which Count Dracula is the victim , he does not enjoy his immortality and wants only to live, love and die like a human ,this version of Nosferatu, in places almost a frame for frame remake , it results to be an enjoyable homage . Followed by Nosferatu in Venice by Augusto Caminito and Mario Caiano with Christopher Plummer , Donald Pleasence and also with Klaus Kinski . Furthermore Shadow of the Vampire with Willem Defoe and John Malkovich ; it is a film about the making and production of Nosferatu ; it had to deal with a lot of strange things ,some crew members disappeared, some died, this movie focuses on the difficult relationship between Murnau, the director, and Schreck, the lead actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to get plague off your teeth...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it is a creepy film and at times quite brilliant in capturing with shadows and stop motion photography sense of true dread, the main culprit in the undermining of Nosferatu is with it's clunky story telling and comical acting.I will normally cut a lot of slack for the temperament of silent film theatrics, but considering the place this film holds amongst most, if not all critics, I'm going to have to judge it a little bit harder than the other classic films of its time. Again, kudos for finding and then maintaining such a great look and feel throughout the entire film, but really, I can't go any higher than a seven. There's too many questions concerning the two main characters in their haste to race back from Transylvania. Why won't Hutter take his love away from Nosferatu? He did sell him the house across the street, he had to know this scenario was going to take place. Also, why leave it as a mystery to the character of Knock? At least with Renfield we understand why he is slave to Dracula. In Nosferatu there's not much to go on plot wise to signify any connection, other than that crazy looking home buyers document. I realized Knock was crazy, but I didn't know he was Transylvanian crazy.This is a must see film, don't get me wrong. But other than making a note of it and moving on to other films, I can't see why this film get the love it gets from critics.But, it is really, really creepy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie, specially because most of the scenes must have been really hard to make in 1922. However, I liked so much of Bram Stoker's "Dracula" that I was expecting a lot more from this (maybe I actually forgot this was made in German in 1922 and I shouldn't have). However, I did find Nosferatu creepy at times, specially Max Schreck character. He was just perfect for the role. None the less being a masterpiece, I really wished the story was more loyal to "Dracula": in the end everything ends up fine, in the movie Ellen dies. Also, I missed Van Helsing very much: I was always expecting for him to appear. Maybe I shouldn't think so much in the "inspired by Dracula" sentence: after all, it's an 1922 adaptation. For everybody who is wondering if this movie is worth watching: yes, it is. It's extraordinary how Murnau was able to film all this and still make it feel real.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The images in this film are deeply frightening. Modern depictions of the vampire, at the behest of the studios no doubt, are of handsome, charming gentlemen who, even when they shift at night to monster form, retain grace and appeal. Nosferatu is a horror.I think the best way to approach art is, in Harold Bloom's terms, to read it outward from within. There's a danger in trying to see a work in a social context because you're starting from a false focal point, one you've yourself ordained as critical. That said, I think it's hard to read any film that came out of 1922 Germany outside the context of WWI. One of the most meaningless, mindless, devastating events in human history, and Murnau is very much the Nosferatu who rose from the grave to tell the tale of those undead, survivors in a changed world -- after all, how could life ever have been the same after the war; no, it must assume some new, unspeakable, unnatural and abominable form.The meek beast notwithstanding, other memorable images for me include that establishing shot of the ship at sea (I don't think I've seen this imitated since, which is surprising); the clever intercutting of Ellen's sleepwalk with the trolling vampire a sea away; the shadow of his clawed hand crawling up her nightgown; the reverse negative of the frantic carriage; the fast-motion current of the nighttime river; the extreme longshot of the townspeople chasing the scarecrow (and Murnau's clever use of the iris to simulate a gargantuan setting sun) -- all images that play with the notion of time and how it manipulates nature and vice versa, which, to me, is the most intriguing aspect of the vampire myth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is both horrifying and comical. The make up used on the vampire is amazing. His ears look like they belong on an elf and his skin is extremely pale. His teeth look like they can be real even though they are all pointy and some rotted. The one make-up touch that is most interesting is his fingers. His fingers are abnormally long which makes his hunched over body even more awkward looking. One could think he wouldn't be able to pick anything up with them, yet he carries around his own coffin everywhere he goes. Thats the comical part of the movie (when he carries his coffin) the music that is played as he walks sometimes makes it almost impossible to stay serious.Some of the most interesting shots are those in which you see nothing but his shadows. When the monster is suppose to be walking up the stairs all you can see is the shadow of his long skeletal body and fingers. His look itself is just scary to think about. When he is on the ship walking and his body rises up. The first thing that comes to mind is " keep that thing far away from me" With his eyes bulging out of his head and his intense stair it seems as if the vampire is going to walk directly out of the screen. Moments like this occur all throughout the film. Its a good movie for someone to watch if they want to both be slightly frightened yet laugh a few times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FW Murnau's Nosferatu is a very different adaptation of the Dracula story than Browning's later and more popular version. While Bela Lugosi is a suave, dignified and seductive vampire, Max Schreck is much more repulsive and foul feeling in his portrayal of the undead creature. And it is interesting to see the differences in vision and style that the two directors took for essentially the same story.Nosferatu is an impressive film with an air of dread and this sense of repulsion that clings to it for the duration of the movie. The use of light and shadow and interesting direction and camera work contribute to the atmosphere here. The scene where the shadow of the vampire is seen slowly progressing up the stairs with exaggerated and distorted form leaves a lasting impression on the viewer, as do various other manifestations of the vampire-for instance, when he is seen rising from a supine position without any part of his body bending.While overall I think I prefer Browning's Dracula, Nosferatu is an impressive film that is certainly worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one's the great-Grandaddy of vampire movies and still packs quite a wallop, even though its impact is severely diminished on a second viewing when the story starts to drag ? which is never a good thing for an 80-minute film.Those iconic images of Max Schreck, silhouetted against the rigging of the ship whose crew he has systematically devoured, rising stiff-backed from his coffin, climbing the stairs to his victim's room, his talon-like nails and misshapen head, his ascent charted by the movement of his shadow on the wall, are so embedded in the psyche of any true movie fan that seeing them in their true context is a little like seeing a long-cherished hero in the flesh. Trouble is, by the second or third viewing, images of Paul Whitehouse's 'monster, monster' take-off inevitably start taking over. The film is quite faithful to Bram Stoker's novel, but there is only fundamental attention paid to character development, and the guy who plays Jonathon Harker (the subtitles of the version I watched referred to the characters by the names given to them by Stoker) is truly irritating. His acting style of exaggerated gestures was out-dated even in 1922. Max Shreck, however, barely on screen for more than 10- minutes, elevates the film to another dimension.Watch it once and remember it for its initial impact, otherwise you're likely to be disappointed if you return for a second bite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nosferatu should absolutely be respected for it's contribution to, and advancement of, the film industry and particularly horror movies. The film offers special effects that were cutting edge at the time and still maintain some of their power in creating terror and tension. The particular version I viewed wasn't good, so beware. My DVD rental was through Netflix and severely detracted from the film. There were no color filters added to this cut, which meant that I had to watch Nosferatu parade around in the daylight. Why did they film night scenes during the day anyway? Make sure you get a release that has the color filters added. The soundtrack varies from release to release as well. My version had a beautifully orchestrated symphonic masterpiece, that was at odds with what was being shown more often than not. All film students and true horror fans should see this film at least once to appreciate it's cinematic contributions, just beware of questionable release cutting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Graunes is arguably one of the most horrific adaptations of Bram Stoker's Dracula ever produced for film. In order to better understand the reasons for my 8 out of 10 ranking, I will first explain how it's characteristics of expressionism make it fit in with other films released in Germany during the 1920s. Then, I will explain the most obvious and key difference between this film and other Dracula films. Finally, I will briefly describe how Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Graunes has withstood the test of time, on the screen and in the courtroom.The period between about 1919 and the rise of the German Nazi movement in 1933 was a time of what is now known as The German Golden Age of film-making. Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Graunes is one of the landmark films made in Germany during this golden age. Of course, the beginning of the German Golden Age was when the horrifying masterpiece Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari was released in 1919. This was one of the first attempts at what is now called expressionism in film-making. Expressionism is defined as aesthetics in which ideas and feelings are shown through exaggerated elements in the image such as lighting, decor, and content. Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari took expressionism to the extreme with the use of carefully constructed indoor sets that made everything on screen seem distorted and anti-real. Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Graunes, released 3 years later, brought to its audience very exaggerated shots (extremely tall beds, misshapen windows, grotesque makeup, exaggerated shadows, etc.). But one of the main differences between Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Graunes and Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari is the amount of screen time that shows nature. Many of the expressionist shots in Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Graunes where outside, depicting some of the abnormalities in nature. This is an important element when discussing this film because it puts a rather disturbing twist on the natural world that contributes to a pessimistic air throughout the movie. For instance, when the hyena is shown, its simply unattractive appearance and disproportionate body adds to the film a sense that something is not quite right with the current situation. In most films it is a relief to see shots of trees or of the horizon, but Murnau proves with Nosferatu that this does not have to be necessarily true. Many of the most disquieting shots where actually shot outside for instance, the long shot of the castle, and the scarecrow shot. The expressionism in Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Graunes is obviously there, which puts this film rightfully so in the realm of the German Golden Age, which is characterized by a strong emphasis on expressionism.Next, it is important to realize that one of the foremost reasons that this film has become such a memorable film is because it does not show Dracula as he is usually depicted. This unauthorized version of the 1897 novel does not portray the count as a handsome, deceiving man. Instead, the antagonist (Count Orlok as he is called instead of Dracula because it is an unofficial adaptation of the novel) is as ugly and unattractive as a count can be. With his rat-like appearance, Max Schreck certainly gives the movie a dark feel. Just the appearance of this Orlok on the screen is enough to scare viewers, even if he is not actually doing something horrific while on screen. Schreck is simply horrifying to watch. If someone is on screen for no more than 10 minutes total and can have an entire movie made around their character, they must me one sick looking puppy.As stated above, Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Graunes is an UNOFFICIAL adaptation of Bram Stoker's original Dracula novel. I think that because of this, Count Orlok has been created into this sort of rebellious icon that seems to constantly lurk (much as he does on the actual film) behind all of the other, "pretty-boy" vampires. Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Graunes has become a sort of cult classic not only because of its extreme appearance of the count himself, but also because of the persecution it has endured over the past century. The Prana-Film Company declared bankruptcy after Bram Stoker's estate acted for his widow, Florence Stoker, and sued for copyright infringement. The Stoker estate won the case and the court ordered all existing prints of Nosferatu destroyed. Luckily, copies of the film had already been distributed around the world. These prints were then copied over the years, helping Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Graunes gain its current reputation as one of the greatest movie adaptations of the vampire legend. When most people think of silent horror films, their minds immediately recall that horrifying image of Count Orlok towering in the doorway of a dimly lit room or rising from his casket staring forebodingly into the camera.Through the use of deliberate expressionism, alterations of a classic story, and a nasty battle in lawsuits, Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Graunes proves that it is a must-see film for any true movie fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A silent horror classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this unauthorized 1922 adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel, "Dracula" (or at least some of it) years ago, but at that point, I was only around nine years old, and it wouldn't have meant much to me at all. However, over a decade later, I watched the entire film, and even though it was my first time ever sitting down on my own to watch a silent movie, meaning that I wasn't exactly used to watching films from this era, I was still VERY impressed with this particular one! Jonathon Harker is a resident in the town of Bremen in 1838, where he lives with his wife, Nina. For a living, he works as a real estate agent. One day, Harker is sent by his strange employer, R.M. Renfield, on a long journey to the Carpathian Mountains, where he is to complete a sale with the mysterious Count Orlok, who has sent a letter showing interest in purchasing a house in Bremen. On Harker's way to Count Orlok's castle, he comes to a nearby inn. Here, he looks in a book called "The Book of the Vampires", but does not believe any of the frightening things it says. However, after Harker reaches his destination, he eventually learns the horrifying truth about Count Orlok, and much trouble lies ahead for Harker, his wife, and the whole town of Bremen! It has now been more than eight decades since the release of "Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens" (a.k.a. "Nosferatu"). Some movies from this long ago haven't aged very well as time has gone by, but "Nosferatu" is clearly one that has! For today's viewers, it can still be very scary (as horror movies are supposed to be) and highly entertaining for fans of the horror genre! So, if you're into horror flicks, then unless you simply dislike films from the silent era in general, I see no reason why you shouldn't watch this groundbreaking 1922 classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd never really watched black ans white horror movies before. But this was on in the day time. So i sat and watched it apart from being highly entertained nosferatu did scare the living daylights out of me.The whole film years later is a landmark horror movie despite the court drama that went with the copright of Dracula and bram stokers wife. Although the 20's was when the film was still in infancy. This was a benchmark in horror. His face is known through out the world and scares little kids despite how old it is.This is a classic example of how some movies can still be good or even brilliant no matter how old they may be. Nosferatu will give anyone nighmares.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERSThis is by far my favorite silent film. It was just plain creepy without sound! That's pretty impressive, right? When I was young I was absolutely terrified of Count Orlock. I mean, whenever he came on the television for some commercial I would scream and run. Now, I think he's a brilliant character.Count Orlock is the first Dracula character to come to the big screen along with the first vampire movie ever in 1922. That was nine years before Bela Lugosi in the 1931 Dracula.You all should know the plot to this, so I won't bore you with my speech about the movie's plot. I mean, it is basically Dracula. Anyway, there are hundreds of famous scenes in this film. Here are a few.Jonathan meets Count Orlock with a little hat.Count Orlock in the doorway.Count Orlock in the coffin.Count Orlock's shadow while walking up the stairs.Count Orlock dies.Have you ever noticed that Lemony Snicket's Count Olaf sounds very similar to Count Orlock? That's where Lemony Snicket got his inspiration for Count Olaf.Count Orlock definitely does not the good looks like Bela Lugosi, which looks more like the real Dracula in Bram Stroker's novel. Count Orlock has the head of a rat, and a slight hunchback, and a black suit, and in the beginning of the movie, a little hat.If you're a fan of horror films, pick this sixty-eight minute flick up at Hollywood Video or Blockbuster.9/10 Recommended Films: Dracula, Bram Stroker's Dracula, and Taste the Blood of Dracula.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nosferatu is a timeless production. For some it is shocking, frightening and bloodcurdling for others boring and faint. It's rightly said that it requires specific and understanding approach, especially for the modern audience. Whoever has become convinced to watch it has to be aware that back in 1920's film makers' technological abilities where pretty limited. Expecting Nosferatu to come up to modern criteria is simply sacrilege. The requirements of the modern audience are much different than these 80 years ago. It is noticeable that recently people are more scared of seeing blood and guts all over the place rather than a psychological image of the night's child slowly creeping to get his victim. The editing very nicely works to increase the effectiveness of Nosferatu's image. In general the acting is quite typical for the silent movie era. Because there is no dialog, actors exaggerate their gesticulation and commonly use obvious face expressions that could show their emotions to the viewer. At this point I would like to mention the character of Thomas Hutter. From the very beginning of the movie it's clearly shown how narcissistic and overconfident he is. However as the action goes by we can see how his character undergoes the changes caused by demonic Count Orlok. Max Schreck's acting is different. It's very specific what makes it an outstanding performance. He doesn't gesticulate; he moves slowly, his posture is hunched and his face expression practically does not change throughout the movie what makes it look like a mask. All these factors make up one of the greatest performances I have ever seen. Story telling is surprisingly good especially for a silent movie. However if anyone wants to have a full comprehension about it needs to re-watch the movie. As I mentioned before the editing has been done pretty nicely. All the shots of Nosferatu are very effective. The perfect usage of lighting and shadows as well as his make-up gives the tension, terror and a little bit of the shivers. He was so good that after the movie's release there was a rumor about him being a real vampire. This fact was by the way the main reason I wanted to see this movie although I didn't expect myself to have such a reflection. That is why I am not disappointed. It's important to understand the difference between people's perception now and 80 years ago. I doubt If anyone who was making Nosferatu back in 1920's would have thought how it will be seen in 21st century.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Nosferatu - eine Symphonie des Grauens" (Nosferatu - a symphony of horror) is to my knowledge the first vampire movie ever made, and in my opinion, this still stand as the benchmark. This film is directed by Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau, one of the masters of silent movies, and this is in my view his finest movie. This movie is full of very powerful imagery, which Murnau is famous for and Max Schreck is perfect as the vampire Count Orlok. This movie was recently released on a 2-disc dvd, which is a must for any serious filmcollector. If you want a great vampire-movie, you should go for this one, as it crushes the competition.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brief review of Munich Filmmuseum Restoration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just seen the world theatrical premier of the restoration done by the Munich Filmmuseum. It was presented, along with the premier of a restoration of Alraune (1928), by University of Chicago's Documentary Film Group. A similar review of Alraune can be found on IMDb. Filmmuseum Director Stefan Drler provided a brief introduction and information about the restoration process. The berexcellent Aljoshe Zimmerman provided piano accompaniment to the film. The film itself was utterly magnificent. Drler said that the film was approximately 1900 meters, I believe. In restoring, the Filmmuseum paid attention to getting the original intertitles just right as well as properly tinting the film as was likely intended by Murnau. What results is not merely a film, but an experience in art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Max Schreck is the creepiest cinematic vampire by far. His wide eyes and snaggle-teeth evoke the rats he is associated with in the film. Even for those who don't like silent films or know anything about Murnau, you should see this movie for the vampire. My friends and I were doing the stiff-armed "vampire walk" for days afterwards. Unfortunately, as in Coppola's version, the Harker character comes off as exquisitely annoying. Don't let that deter you though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly terrifying film classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the few truly terrifying films ever made, Nosferatu is a classic film, pure and simple. The atmosphere is phenomenal, just bristling with that early German style. Max Shrek looks incredible as Orlock, easily the most terrifying image of a vampire of all-time. As for the score, I saw the Type O Negative version. Very uneven, though at times it's truly amazing. In many scenes it seems very out of place, but in others such as the infamous Door scene, it fit perfectly and elevated the tension of an already scary scene. The actors weren't very good, but it's not often you see a silent film with good actors. Overall this is one of the only films that can actually scare me. Though Dracula '31 is easily a better film, it doesn't even hold a candle to this in terms of pure scare factor.8.5/10 PS - The DVD I have had a rather interesting introduction by David Carradine that I enjoyed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>History of Nosferatu: The Basic History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a classic of the German film director Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau.Nosferatu meaning "Likes the Blood", was originally determined by the wife of Bram Stoker to be a illegal film copy of her husbands book. Just before the film Dracula(1931) was released she made sure that every copy of the film had been destroyed or so she thought.When this event happened, F. W. Murnau was horribly hurt because he made the film as a tribute to his favorite book and writer Bram Stoker.Later in the 1930's film copies of Nosferatu started showing up in Austria and only three copies are known to exist today, this film was the only true showing of what Stoker wanted his Dracula to be like and it was captured well by the master of horror F. W. Murnau.In fact, the Dracula film was way off from what Stoker intended his vampire to be like. He said Alucard was a ugly malformed dawn walking monster. His family didn't want to scare children, so the vampire was turned into a handsome smooth talking gentleman, but this was not the way Stoker would have wanted it, so current films are ruined because of the rudeness of Mrs. Stoker a true loser.We rate Mrs. Stoker to be a true loser because if she had gotten her way Nosferatu wouldn't exist today and I would have never gotten a view of the most interesting film at early parts of the 1920's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still has great staying power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many things that place this film in your "see before you die" category. It's a priceless, fantastic piece of work, from start to finish, and it has beautiful staying power, even now. But there are a few things that work against it. The music to the film lends neither good, nor bad to it. Understandably, this is very early film, and perception of people watching the film in the twenties was probably vastly different, but seeing as this could be considered one of the earliest horror movies, the music from this film could very much have been better used in a silent drama, or comedy.On that note, Max Schreck is perfect. Much has been said about his ability to capture the character so perfectly (as in Shadow of the Vampire), and it's true. Though it's in no way comparable to Bela Lugosi as a character, this movie is still a very important piece in cinema, and I'm honored to be able to say that I've had the opportunity to sit down and enjoy a brilliant work of early cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the opening scenes, "Nosferatu" establishes itself through a series of ominous images: an obscured sunset, a silenced crowd at a Carpathian inn, and two of the most dreadfully frightening characters I've ever witnessed in a film. Max Schreck and Alexander Granach play Count Orlock and Mackler Knock respectively, and both deliver performances that, even though they are silent, evoke as much fear and mystery as Hannibal Lecter.What is so impressive about this film is that it is able to inspire fear without modern horror film conventions. No objects suddenly revealing themselves alongside a bold musical note, no horror villain stereotypes. This movie inspires fear through the manipulation of its characters; their movements, their costume and in the case of Count Orlock, their slow, foreboding walk. The most frightening point in this film is when the wide eyes of Max Schreck are first seen. This is not the kind of horror that warrants a scream, but rather leaves you completely silent and in awe of its geniusI gave this movie a 9 almost exclusively because of its innovation and artistry. The plot, which bares little resemblance to the Stoker novel in that it doesn't include many of the sub-stories, is not as enthralling as recent versions. Then again it doesn't need it, the purpose is clear and apparent; Nosferatu is not suave or manipulating, it is a torn, haunted soul and this movie gives the only sincere depiction of Dracula that I have seen. Truly remarkable. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Atmospheric and expressionistic horror classic that was part of a fruitful period in German art especially the cinema. During the 1920s German cinema flousished with films that gave us images ranging from bizarre to breathtaking. The Greatest horror film of the Silent period because there isn't any other film of its genre that is amazing in visual storytelling. Excellent direction by a pioneer of German Cinema, F.W. Murnau. He was one of the best directors from his country besides Fritz Lang and a couple other German filmmakers. Nosferatu(1922) is Dracula in everything but namesake. Max Schreck is menacing as the mysterious and sad figure Count Dracula. Remade into a very good picture by Werner Herzog with a faithful homage to Max Schreck by Klaus Kinski. The greatest adaptation of the Dracula story ever put on the motion picture screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With well over a hundred reviews on IMDB and Amazon, and with only a few disappointed viewers, this seminal work by Murnau is proven yet again to be a masterpiece of horror, as enjoyable today as when it was first released. The print I saw on TCM is the newly restored, tinted and complete version (84 minutes compared to the 63 of most earlier video releases) and it is like night and day compared to the earlier available materials. This is the sharpest print I have seen and the tinting is excellent (yellow, brown, red, lavender and blue take us from full sun to interiors, to sunsets, to twilight to night). The adaptation is masterly and the "gimmicks" used to great effect. Was it a joke or deliberate that a mirror is placed leaning on the wall behind the creature as it feeds on Ellen with Orlock clearly reflected in it - we first see her husband as the film opens also preening in front of a mirror. Is this a Freudian Jekyll and Hyde story as well as a vampire film? Very highly recommended for all who love film and masterful direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A let-down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr Orlock/Nosferatu (Max Schreck) is a freak. He wants to buy a secluded house opposite Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim) and so Hutter, an estate agent, travels to Transylvania where Mr Orlock lives with the deeds to the new property for him to sign. He gets there, the deal is done and he returns. Orlock arrives at his new house and takes a fancy to Hutter's wife, Ellen (Greta Schroder). She realizes that she must make a sacrifice to stop the evil one.....This film is only good for the scenes with Nosferatu. You have to completely suspend belief with the story. There is NO WAY that Hutter would stick around at Orlock's castle after seeing him. NO WAY. But then again, he is an estate agent so he deserves to get bitten by the vampire freak. Or does he? Is it only mosquito bites that he has? The majority of the film is pretty dull and Hutter is a smiling idiot. The character of "Knock" played by Alexander Granach is very peculiar indeed. He is described as being a little odd - wow! That's an understatement. He is as big a freak as Nosferatu and becomes the town's scapegoat for all the deaths that are suddenly occurring. The only character that achieves any kind of emotional connection with the audience is Ellen. The film storyline is not always clear so you have to make assumptions while you are watching and there is no grand build-up to a climax. The film is suddenly at the denouement. This film has a scary monster - that's all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing after Caligari</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nosferatu, the famous German version of Bram Stoker's Dracula is something of a disappointment. Visually, it's nothing compared to expressionist masterpieces like Caligari or Metropolis. I understand that actual Eastern European locations and buildings were used instead of sets. That was a mistake. You just have to look at the beauty of Lugosi's castle in the 1931 English version of the Bram Stoker novel to see why. There is no reason why Nosferatu - given the expressionist abilities of the Germans - could not have been even more beautiful than Dracula.Also, the pacing feels quite sluggish for a 94 minute long movie. The only exceptional thing for me was Max Schreck as a truly vile Count Orlock. He is physically repulsive and looks like a monster. He has none of the campiness of Lugosi or the physical power of a Christopher Lee - just a menacing, detestable, sickly creature. There is an excellent movie called The Shadow of the Vampire starring Willem Dafoe as Schreck. Its a fictional movie but much more watchable than Nosferatu. I actually wasted time watching this because of Shadow of the Vampire and my liking for Caligari and Metropolis. This isn't even remotely as good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In The Minority</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously any reviewer has to cut this one a lot of slack. It was made in 1922, a time when people were still amazed by the ability of others to project moving images onto a screen. Although films had already been produced for years at this point, there were still plenty of bugs to be worked out in direction, storytelling and plenty of other areas.I kept all of this in mind when watching "Nosferatu." Based on the high ratings other IMDb users have given, I'm clearly in the minority when I say I wasn't all that crazy about it. Even with its limitations in mind, it too often drags along at a snail's pace. It's also somewhat episodic, lacking a seamless flow from one scene to the next. And other than a few memorable scenes with Max Shreck's hideous vampire -- truly one of the all-time frightening screen villains -- it's not all that interesting. I think anyone, whether they liked this picture or not, can agree that Shreck is the highlight.So what more can I say? I honestly gave "Nosferatu" an honest chance. I'm a pretty lenient critic and am willing to forgive a lot of faults. I just wasn't highly entertained by this one. Even movies long considered classics can turn out dull.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I consider `Shadow of the Vampire' one of the most intelligent films ever made. Herzog's remake of this is even interesting if terminally flawed (as Herzog himself gets bitten).And this has some intensity to it. One can readily imagine it set in its time as a masterpiece of true horror. But transporting ones vision back eighty years strains all the visceral pleasures away. Either way, this is pretty lame stuff now. Everyone should watch it - not for enjoyment but as a foundation for fuller realization of what followed.The one interesting thing here for me was the historical splinter of true magic: the Bulwer character. I think he is original to this version. He is based on the famous novelist Bulwer Lytton (influence of Henry Irving who Stoker managed), who cofounded a `magickal` society based on stuff derived from cabala and celtic mysticism. This stuff was pretty potent in terms of its evil side and is the true incubator of the vampire myths.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nosferatu is a pretty good silent film, but I don't think it has aged as well as other silent films. Some of the cinematic techniques haven't aged well - I'm particularly thinking of the scene where Nosferatu stocks his wagon, getting ready to leave. The film is speeded up, a technique which is associated more with silent comedies, especially of the Keystone variety, so it made me laugh. I also laughed at the line: "Your wife has a beautiful throat." However, Max Schreck has to be the best vampire I've ever seen. I saw this film about five months ago in preparation to see Shadow of the Vampire, which I had heard about when it was at Cannes. So, although I don't think it has aged well, Nosferatu is certainly worth watching, if only for Schreck, who more or less steals the entire film anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The scariest horror film I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About the only classic horror film that even comes close to NOSFERATU in terror is the early sound film, FREAKS. Despite the ability to use modern appliances and technology to make extremely graphic horror movies today, the stuff being called horror just doesn't come close to these older films when it comes to setting a mood and scaring the pants off you.This version of Dracula is different from the Bram Stoker novel in several ways because the producers of the film didn't want to pay royalties! So, Dracula's name was changed to Dr. Orlock and the title itself was also changed. Otherwise, its a very similar movie. In fact, the plot is so close I won't even bother to give a summary other than to say that the way the vampire dies in the end is VERY different from other Dracula films (unless you see the 1979 remake of NOSFERATU, which, of course, is similar).Finally, I strongly recommend you try to watch Shadow of the Vampire, a movie starring John Malkovich where they recreate dramatically the story behind the film. All of Murnau's strange idiosyncrasies are revealed and this is a real great addition to the original film.So why is it so creepy? Well, like the 1931 version, it's filmed in glorious black and white--a must for good horror. Secondly, this Dracula is not the suave and handsome guy he is in some other films. In fact, he's downright awful! With a bald head, pointed ears, weird fangs that consist of his front two teeth and incredibly long, slender and pointed fingers, he is like a nightmare come to life!! Plus, and this is the absolutely creepiest part, his leaving his coffin early is the film will scare the life out of the viewer--as instead of bending his body to get up, he rises up vertically (they must have had someone underneath pushing him up to give this effect) and rats come pouring out of the coffin from his feet! This is a sight no other Dracula film can equal.The only negatives are the rather old-fashioned plot elements here and there. However, director F. W. Murnau (who made a career out of making magical and other-worldly images on film) did an amazing job in creating the mood and magic that was this film and these very minor problems can easily be forgiven.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dusty, cobwebby delight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This landmark film is still considered a classic of the Gothic cinema to this day, despite being nigh on seventy years old. Casual viewers reared on the latest gore-drenched horror spectaculars will obviously find it difficult to enjoy this film, being as it's pretty dated. For instance, the print jumps repeatedly and bears many scratches. Even so, it's not in bad shape for a tiny film which was made ten years before Lugosi's Dracula, itself a feature which remains very dated, in some instances more so than this film. The silent nature of the film may put off other viewers, as the acting is all rather staged and more akin to mime than any realistic type of portrayal.The story itself is nothing original, being merely an unauthorised rip-off of Dracula. However what is original are the stylistic touches and visual flair which fills the film with a certain kind of Gothic dread, building up layer after layer of atmosphere through shadow work. The score, also, is brilliant, although I viewed it with James Bernard's new music. This, I feel, only added to the film, giving it a Hammer feel and a rich Gothic atmosphere, the music both moving and stirring, and most of all thrilling.However it's the character of Nosferatu himself that sticks in the mind, brilliantly and spookily played by the German Max Schreck. Nosferatu is a hideously ugly, inhuman fiend, more like a demon than a handsome man, such as the one Christopher Lee used to play. There are many scenes which were later on to become clichd through overuse in the horror genre (for instance, watch SALEM'S LOT for a feeling of dj? vu), but in this film they are all fresh and interesting. The hand crawling from the coffin, the sudden shock of Nosferatu raising himself from his coffin in the ship's hold, all of these moments are so obviously influential on the films of today. As is the classic image of Nosferatu's stiff shadow climbing the staircase, or the clever special effect where he disappears in the sunlight at the end.While admittedly slow and dated, Nosferatu easily overcomes these flaws by being a beautifully-made, intelligent adaptation of the Dracula novel, which, unlike many, many latter day productions, still has the ability to provoke fear, and that's saying something for a dusty old film made before even our grandparents were alive. Powerful and brooding in equal measure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nosferatu is genre definer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>F.W. Murnau's "Nosferatu" is a genre defining horror film that was far ahead of its time. Much like most of the German films that came out in and around the 1920's, this film was heavily influenced by the end of WWI and was part of the German expressionist movement. Murnau used multiple editing techniques, most notably the montage, that were far from as common as they are today. Although the scare factor of the monster's reveal hasn't quite stood the test of time with the huge technological advances we have made in the last century, there is no denying the brilliance and the effect "Nosferatu" has had on the horror genre as a whole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From as early on as 1913 with Hanns Heinz Ewers' somewhat plodding The Student of Prague all the way through to Robert Wiene's seminal Caligari, cinema had been experimenting and teasing with the still- undefined horror genre, mixing starkly haunting photography with Gothic macabre stories echoing the works of Mary Shelley and Edgar Allan Poe. While still in a form of relative infancy in 1922, F.W. Murnau takes another stab at establishing cinema's darker side in the form of Nosferatu, a film which never quite pushes the boat out as far as Wiene did two years prior but nevertheless makes a haunting and memorable experience on its own ground.As far as vampire stories, legends and big-screen productions go, Murnau's classic film is one that may not frighten quite as much as it might have done but nevertheless still manages to startle with its beautiful photography and otherworldly performances, all the while pushing you unknowingly into an unsettling atmosphere that envelops the imagination during its strongest sequences. Max Schreck?who will perhaps always be most vividly remembered for his portrayal as Count Graf Orlok here more than anything else?may not be as commanding or entertaining to watch as John Barrymore was a year earlier in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, but there are more than a handful of moments where even now almost a century later, Shreck's dead-eyed gaze and stilted, robotic movements are unsettling and haunting to watch.Where the film tends to suffer is during its middle-half where a lengthy boat ride goes awry. Set largely during the day and lacking the eerie claustrophobic sets that dominate the first and last half- hours, these scenes don't have quite the same amount of grip and only sporadically play with or develop the sense of tension and suspense instilled earlier on. Nevertheless, there's still plenty to take away from the experience as a whole, whether seen for historical, aesthetical or purely entertainment reasons. The film's greatest parts, which are set mostly during the dark hours and feature haunting photography bringing to life a thrillingly dark narrative, would go on to further develop the horror genre into its heydays of the 30s and burn images of horror into the minds of its audiences for decades to come. Today, it's not quite as horrifying, but there's an artistry and distinctly unsettling atmosphere throughout that even the ensuing decades since haven't managed to soften.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it for the macabre Count Orlok</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who can forget Max Schreck as the ultra-creepy 'Count Orlok', a classic performance in horror movie history? Director F.W. Murnau gives us a scary, macabre vampire, far from the smooth and suave Draculas in other versions, and uses shadows and shots of Orlok's face to scare the audience throughout the movie. Orlok has elongated arms and claw-like hands, dark eyebrows and glowering eyes with a sinister stare, and is truly spine-tingling.You see in this film so many of the trademark horror elements, such as the villagers in an inn warning young Hutter about the danger as he mentions his plans to go to Orlok's castle, which may remind you of movies like 1981's 'An American Werewolf in London'. And yet, this one deserves credit for being first, in 1922, and for giving us some fantastic scenes, such as the one of Hutter finding and opening his coffin, where we see just a fraction of Orlok's evil face initially, eyes open and long fangs visible. Alexander Granach is also great as 'Knock', his minion/ estate agent with giant, bushy eyebrows, who, when jailed, catches and eats flies for their blood.I don't think it's cool that Murnau changed the names around because he couldn't get movie rights to Bram Stoker's story, but I'm glad the film survived (Stoker's heirs wanted all prints destroyed). The movie drags on at times and the simplicity of the ending was not satisfying to me, so it fell a little short, but if you're into classic horror films, this is probably must-see and you may love it, instead of just liking it as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...Deathbird....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stark. Surreal. Captivating. A few of the words I would feebly use to describe this film, a first and original of many categories that could be discussed for hours. First surviving vampire film. One of the original surviving horror films, this one set the early stage in not only silent film - but how rights to films and content will be set. This film was all but completely lost - as it was ordered destroyed due to unsecured rights associated with the original Dracula novel. By fate almost - one main copy and a few scraps of others have survived - amalgamated into what we can see today.The experience itself? If you haven't taken the time to watch it - it is a time capsule in many ways. With many period pieces, and older films it is necessary to place yourself in the shoes of not only one of the audience of the time it was released, but that of the filmmaker's interpretation of the period they are representing at the time the film was made to get the intended impact of the film. It is very captivating to see all the uses of production, setting, and manner used to convey this story - all shot in 1921. I think you could watch this 10 times and gain something new from it every time.Many have heard of the great silent acted performance of the character Count Orlock by Max Schreck as legendary. Words cannot surmise, how not only did he portray this being wholly - but did it without any prior example in a completely new form of medium. The character it'self, is an example of the raw folklore of the creature now a common place in pop culture. The performance of that entity being an organic representation at the root of this genre is plainly seen in this film. Its almost like being a film archaeologist, just watching it in the dark.Lastly, as I mentioned, imagine never seeing but one or two simple silent movies in your life. You go to the opera hall, to see this film, and take it all in. Imagine the terror of some of these dark folk tales come to life as light and shadow swoop all over stacking up corpses - and the soul of man and woman alike. "Deathbird" I still wonder what the hell that werewolf is doing out there in the Carpathian countryside...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nosferatu accompanied by German pianist Markus Horn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Viewed by Larry Gleeson at San Luis Obispo California State Polytechnical University's Spanos Theater as part of the 22nd Annual SLO Film Fest, formally known as San Luis Obispo International Film Festival.The complete 2006 digitally restored version of Nosferatu the surreal German Expressionist classic silent film by renowned director, F.W. Murnau, served as the Opening Night film for the 22nd SLO Film Fest with a new piano soundtrack performed live by German composer and pianist, Markus Horn. Most recently, Horn has performed his musical talents to another silent German film, Metropolis, directed by Fritz Lang. Interestingly, Horn created this composition in the Spanos Theater specifically for Nosferatu .Nosferatu, is similar in a stylistic vein to the classic example of German Expressionism, the 1922 silent film, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, with its use of unusual, odd-looking characters, geometric mise-en-scen and its abundant use of light and shadows in its storytelling. A storied production, Nosferatu, an unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker's "Dracula," was shot in 1921 and released the following year in 1922. It is very similar to "Dracula," retaining its core characters of Jonathan and Nina Harker and the Count while omitting some of the secondary characters.Interestungly, a court ruling ordered all copies of the film destroyed after Prana Film, a short-lived, silent-era German film studio was unable to get the rights to the novel, was sued Bram Stoker's widow and eventually declared bankrupted in defending itself from copyright infringement. A few copies of the film survived as the studio undauntedly had gone forward with the production changing names and details from the original novel. For example, Count Dracula became Count Orlok, played brilliantly by Max Schreck (Schreck in German translates to terror, fitting for the roles Max Schreck undertook throughout his acting career) and the term vampire became nosferatu. In addition, Count Orlok doesn't create new vampires. Instead he killed his victims with the town folk blaming the deaths on a black plague. And, while Count Dracula was weakened by sunlight, Orlock sleeps by day as any exposure to sunlight would cause his death. In the end, Count Orlok meets his demise in drinking the blood of a young maiden, Mina, who sacrifices herself by allowing Orlok's copulation while enticing him to do so into the day's sunrise culminating in Orlok's death.Director Murnau prided himself on utilizing various angles in his productions and Nosferatu's cinematographer, Fritz Arno Wagner, delivers. Several shots capture the eye including a film ending low angle shot of a castle in ruin representing the demise of Count Orlok. In addition, several shots on board the ship of stacked wooden coffins and the frenzied scrambling of ship rats as a coffin is opened and its contents spilled become etched in memory.All this withstanding, the evening belonged to Markus Horn, as he mesmerized the audience with a soundtrack that brilliantly matched the photographic score in creating a dream like atmosphere for the minimalized intertitled narrative. Horn's intense symbiosis of film and music culminated in a rousing, standing ovation by an enraptured audience at the film's end.This version of Nosferatu with the Markus Horn accompaniment and a run-time of 94 minutes left the audience wanting more. Much more. An exceptional opening film. Highly, highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An All Time Horror Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Murnau! A genius, visionary pioneer of cinema! F.W. Murnau directed classic after classic, and among his greatest achievements are films such as "The Last Laugh", "Sunrise", and "Tabu", but his most famous film is, without a doubt, "Nosferatu"."Nosferatu" is the scariest vampire movie I've ever seen. It doesn't have to rely on cheap jump-scares and over the top violence, but instead sends chills down the viewers spine with great atmosphere, directing, and an unforgettably creepy performance by Max Schreck.Its surreal and dreamlike atmosphere manages to be created all thanks to Murnau's cinematic vision. His films reflect a true love of dreams-and "Nosferatu" feels just like a dream or, rather, like a nightmare. He's one of the cinematic pioneers that proved that film that doesn't need to be in any way lifelike, and that you can really do anything in front of a camera. The movies are magic, and that's what "Nosferatu" (and all other Murnau masterpieces) prove."Nosferatu" (along with "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari") is the most famous and widely beloved of the German Expressionist classics. It's a beautiful movie, and always has been, and is made all the more beautiful and haunting thanks to the way Murnau uses creepy lighting and shadows to enhance the horror.This film is a masterpiece of the horror genre-a truly chilling classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bit of a disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came into this film thinking I'd enjoy it. I didn't necessarily think I was without a doubt going to call it a masterpiece, but I hoped I'd enjoy the film, and while I do respect it for its historical significance, it could not hold my interest very well.First of all, I would like to address the positives. Probably the most impressive part is the cinematography. There are some great shots in this film, like when the Nosferatu is on the stairs. The compositions of these shots in the film contain plenty of shadows and a variety of shades of gray that is visually pleasing. Max Schreck's performance as Nosferatu also stands out. It's exaggerated, but just enough so that it works well and doesn't come off as ridiculous. The make up on Nosferatu is also a very helpful enhancement. Lastly, the film also featured some decent set design, especially the castle. I admired how realistic the sets frequently looked rather than having two dimensional backdrops on a stage.Disappointingly, the movie contains a thin and often predictable plot with an overuse of title cards. The dependency on title cards got really tiring and eventually felt irritating to have to read paragraphs of text rather than seeing it shown visually on screen. Even worse, all of the characters were one dimensional. Because of this, they were too bland to be able to sympathize with or get interested in, which caused me to not care at all about what would happen to any of them or what they were trying to do. The acting in the film, other than Max Schreck's performance, can feel terribly dated. I'm sure it worked back then in the 1920s, but now a lot of it feels laughably hammy. The performance of the protagonist Hutter, for example, was so overdone that I could not take any scene he was in seriously, which often ruined the films chances at being creepy. Ultimately, due to all of these problems, it was impossible for me to care about anything within the film and therefore the moments that should have been suspenseful, creepy, or just plain interesting in general were instead dull and boring.I have the urge to be extra generous while rating this film, since it is so old and influential, but I just can't give it more than a 4 out of 10. There's just only so much slack I can cut, and if it didn't offer much of anything interesting to me, then I'd be lying to say I liked it.</fullReview>

The atmosphere, in particular the sense of dread, that Murnau creates is palpable, and he uses every trick of light and shade at his disposal in doing so.Being a silent movie, the performances are very theatrical. Max Schrek is brilliant as Nosferatu, contributing significantly to the eerie atmosphere.Not perfect - the pacing is a bit uneven, and the plot sometimes feels contrived.Still, an absolute classic.</fullReview>

Bela Lugosi as Count Dracula is excellent, but he played Dracula like a charming nobleman. Lugosi was even wearing a tuxedo. But Max Schreck as Count Orlok was much scarier. He was taller than Lugosi, he was bald, he had those ugly hands, and was just downright terrifying and ugly. Lugosi never really bothered me, but Schreck actually gave me the creeps and made me cringe. Orlok is even an uglier name than Dracula. The German cinematography is also creepy and it really works.

		<shortDescription>Nosferatu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not watch "Nosferatu" by choice. One of the modules I picked for my first term this year in college is European Cinema, which started off with German Expressionism. "Nosferatu" was one of the films we had to watch, and it is, at least to me, one of the better ones.Directed by F.W. Murnau, one of the most highly acclaimed Expressionist directors, "Nosferatu" is an unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel, "Dracula." Stoker's widow was unimpressed with this, and asked for all copies of "Nosferatu" to be destroyed. Most were, but one survived, which is the print that people around the world have seen since 1922.Set in a small German town, a cheerful young real estate agent named Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim) is summoned by his shady employer, Knock (Alexander Granach), to Transylvania. He is to sell a house to the reclusive man known as Count Orloc (Max Schrek). Hutter obliges, leaving his beloved wife, Helen (Greta Schrder), pining for him at home. Hutter heads to Romania, where he is warned by locals and books of the occult that where he is heading is not safe. Not even when the carriage that is transporting him refuses to go any further sways his stubborn mind. Alas, it is only when he meets the strange Orloc that Hutter realizes things are not all well in the mountains of Transylvania. He cuts himself when eating a late dinner with his host, to which Orloc reacts with erotic flourish, "your blood... your precious blood!" Odd happenings occur at Orloc's castle, such as doors opening for the Count without him moving his hands, Hutter falling unconscious in a chair only to wake up with a peculiar mark on his neck. Most bizarre of all, is when Orloc proceeds to attack his guest on his first night, only for Helen to somehow know something is afoot, calling out her husband's name in a frenzy, distracting the vampire...Hutter eventually discovers that his host sleeps in a coffin, and after seeing him journey away to his new home, across the road from him and his wife, Hutter escapes and tries to make his way back home. Orloc manages to kill an entire ship, leading the people of his new town to believe that they are in the midst of a plague epidemic. This is not helped when Knock, Hutter's boss, goes mad, and starts killing small animals for their blood.Despite illness and overwhelming fear, Hutter gets home to his wife, telling her to not research into the events that are occurring. Alas, Helen finds out that the only thing that will stop the henous Orloc is if a good hearted woman gives her blood to him before the cock's first crow...As a horror film, "Nosferatu" is more chilling than scary. It showcases many human fears, both from the time period and today. There is an underlying sexual tone, perhaps due to Murnau's sexuality (he was openly gay), where the unusually flamboyant man is seduced against his will by a creature of undetermined gender. There is Helen; is she deprived of sex from her husband (which from the amount of kissing they do seems unlikely), or does she see her husband is conflicted and offers herself to Orloc for his freedom? There is the fear of the unknown, of being possessed. Losing control of oneself, of what can not be seen or unseen. Of sickness and death. Of love and war. "Nosferatu" may not be a scary film, but, in the words of Roger Ebert, it haunts us.8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vampire classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Murnau's take on the famous Dracula tale and it is exactly these films that made Germany such a successful nation in terms of silent movies. They did not have the quality or quantity like France or the United States when it came to very early silent short films, but in terms of feature films they are right there at the top. "Metropolis" is probably the most known example, but "Nosferatu" follows right behind. This one was made when vampires did not sparkle in the sun, but actually die if they do not make it into their coffin quickly.There are several runtimes listed here, but the version I saw had slightly over 1.5 hours, which is the longest and the most common as well. This is a silent movie, so all the music and sound effects (the cock noise near the end) was added later on to make this a better viewing experience. In my opinion it does improve the material, but that is a choice that everybody has to make on his own. In any case, the story is such a memorable and fascinating one that even legendary German filmmaker Werner Herzog produced his own approach to the tale starring Kinski, Ganz and Adjani over 50 years later and changing some of the names as well (Hutter became Harker).But back to this 1922 version: It's actually not that long anymore until she has its 100th anniversary. In my opinion, the best parts were the ones that included Nosferatu. Of course his presence was felt during the entire movie, but it was just so much more effective when he was seen, which he was not for almost the entire second half of the film, which is why I guess I preferred the first half. Plague references rounded the whole picture and personal tragedies up nicely, so I imagine people back in the first half of the 20th century were genuinely scared back then. People today probably are not that scared anymore, despite the gruesome looks of Nosferatu, because of the way the medium of film, and horror films as well, have developed over the last 90 years. Still, all in all a pretty good movie and I recommend it.</fullReview>

I am absolutely sick and tired of the trailers and advertisements for generic, pseudo-Gothic, angsty-teenager renditions of vampires - which depict vampires as attractive, romantic men or as cutesy schoolboys. I am glad, in contrast, that movies like this exist. If you are like me and want a vampire that is truly terrifying, please by all means choose "Nosferatu".Also, "Nosferatu" is a truly good film.

		<fullReview>The movie was made in 1922 which would make it younger than The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari which I consider superior in every way. Sure Max Shreck is really frightening as the vampire, here called Count Orlok because copyright issues didn't allow the director to use the Dracula name even though the movie is clearly based on the Dracula novel. This means that Nosferatu is the first Dracula movie preceding the Dracula movie from Universal Studios by 9 years. Dracula from Universal developed its story and characters out better than Nosferatu. Sure the fact that Nosferatu is a silent works as disadvantage but it could have been made up by atmosphere which I find is really lacking. I do the comparison with Cabinet of Dr. Caligari which had much more atmosphere and actually a good story and characters. Nosferatu relies too much on the creepiness of count Orlok. The story is so simple, the characters underdeveloped. Interesting to see as piece of history but there is better silents and silent horrors out there. Not to forget showing hyenas when talking about wolves, it's strange they could get away with that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had lots of fun reading Stoker's novel last autumn. Knowing the book by its reputation only as the vampire story that defined and started it all, after finally reading it (actually, I listened to it for the most part) I realized how little my expectations actually prepared for the wonderful story and above all, the sophisticated narrative structure of the thing: to present the story as a collection of documents, all with their own points of view, from which the "author" weaves, in the guise of an editor, the narrative for us. What rocks my world is, of course, the unnaturally acute subjectivity this method emphasizes that can be appreciated and used in abundance in modern art, even in the most mundanely mainstream production that's about avoiding risk, not inviting it.What made the experience even richer was then to proceed with Murnau's film, available on Blu-ray courtesy of the Masters of Cinema series in a beautiful restoration; after that I'd proceed to Herzog's remake, "Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht" (1979) and close it all with Merhige's "Shadow of the Vampire" (2000), a brilliant piece of cinema in its own right, not merely as an insight into the Murnau film.So here we are. I had of course seen this in the distant and apocryphal past, but the only lasting impression of it was that I really didn't like it that much. As has become a habit of sorts lately, I'm all into revisiting films and giving ? not them ? but myself another chance. Now, there are many eerily effective scenes: the carriage is superb and the scenes on the ship are sublime. I still do, however, prefer "Vampyr" (1932) as the touchstone of the genre, incomparable in the things it does cinematically, even after 80 years. I don't get that sensation here. For me the type of "horror" that this genre exemplifies is most exhibited in Dreyer's unconventional film, where the narrative is shifted from the image to our imagination. The images only serve a kind of hallucinatory ambiance for us to invest ourselves in the film. That kind of cinema doesn't tell, it implies. This film, I'm afraid, is a bit too much of the first sort, despite some of the iconic shots that have become staples of vampire films to come.Not that there aren't many brilliant things here. Among the most interesting is the game it plays with Stoker's novel: it's a film that's not exactly an adaptation but a sibling of a different name; and still it opens as a book, and much like the novel, becomes a recollection of an individual of horrific events. This Dracula-but-not-Dracula level works for its benefit when seen in retrospect.Then there's the emphasis on names, rather underlined because they are supposed to be like characters from Stoker yet aren't. It all starts with Nosferatu, the name that actually occurs twice in Stoker*, and continues to the ship Empusa, which is the name of a Greek demigoddess who used to seduce sleeping men and feast on their flesh and blood. The prologue/overture makes the name Nosferatu into a curse of sorts, warning people from invoking it.And then, of course, the characters of Hutter and Orlok, the first of which is insufferably naive in the beginning, then transformed by Orlok, and then the count himself, who seems so out of place most of the time there's no wonder where the idea for Merhige's film could have originated from. They represent two opposite worlds not only in principle but in reality as well: Hutter is the overtly extrovert an ostentatious, and acts accordingly ostentatiously; Orlok is the silently introvert ghost, whose lank figure creeps and haunts the frame. Their antithetical functions are also emphasized not only in their manners but their houses, especially the ones in Britain. Hutter's house, accommodating him and his wife, is all about idyll and sustaining their marriage, while Orlok's supposed new purchase, the ramshackle house, is all about destruction, and it shows in the exteriors.Although I prefer both Herzog's and Merhige's films over this, a curious occurrence of pure vampirism has taken place: just as those two vampire films suck life from this one, so does Murnau's film grow stronger thanks to the later "remakes". * "Friend Arthur, if you had met that kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die, or again, last night when you open your arms to her, you would in time, when you had died, have become nosferatu, as they call it in Eastern Europe, and would for all time make more of those Un-Deads that so have filled us with horror" and "The nosferatu do not die like the bee when he sting once." The etymology of the word is unclear and still under debate; some trace it to Emily Gerard who argued it's Romanian for "vampire"; others have not found such a word in the language in its written form, yet it most like exists in the oral tradition as either 'nesuferit' ("the insufferable"), 'necuratu' ("the unclean") and 'nefrtatu' ("the devil"). Yet Stoker's meaning was most likely "un-dead".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It really makes me sad that a lot of people don't appreciate silent movies these days. People can't really use their imagination anymore, which is a good thing to use when you are watching a silent movie. However, I try my best, and I really enjoyed this movie. It has a really creepy atmosphere, and even though it's more than 90 years old, it still had some creepy camera angles and shots. I can't imagine how creepy this movie was back in 1922, because it still is a little creepy now. Not scary, just creepy. I really liked the music that was playing throughout, because it really enhanced the movie. The whole time the music was playing I was enjoying the movie. Which means I enjoyed the whole movie. Max Schreck did such a good job at being creepy that I completely admire him, even though he's dead. Everyone else in this film did a wonderful job. Even the extras played a believable part. Also, I think the makeup artists did an absolutely wonderful job on the whole entire cast. Count Orlok (Max Schreck) looked really creepy and real. I even thought that was a real person's face until I took a good look at it, and realized that would be impossible for someone to have teeth like that. Also, the costumes are made so well that I believed they were real clothes and not just costumes. Now on to the general aspects of the movie. I really enjoyed the wonderful acting, well, wonderful for the time, and the effort put into playing a believable character really made me happy. The special effects were very rare, but when they did appear, they were very good. I have no idea how they could make things disappear and reappear with the so limited technology of the time. I could tell they used stop-action for some of the door opening effects, or maybe even string, but it was done in such a way that it was enjoyable. The story line was loosely based on Bram Stoker's Dracula, so it was really entertaining, and somewhat original because the makers shifted some stuff around. In fact, the only reason I don't give this a 10 is because it was kind of hard to follow. Now, that is probably because I took a break while I was watching it, but it might not be, so don't dislike this review because I said it was kind of hard to follow. OK. I was trying to figure out why some things happened and why some things did not, but I still understood the movie 100% by the time it was over. Don't judge! I still really loved this movie though, and it really irks me that some people don't take the time for silent movies. That's really all I have to say. So thanks for reading. See ya!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was a Great Death in 1838 Wisborg, Germany. Real estate agent Knock has associated himself with some kind of evil. He sends young associate Hutter to Count Orlok in Transylvania who claims to want to buy a house. Hutter leaves behind his scared wife Ellen as he travels the dangerous untamed roads. When he gets to Orlok's castle, he finds it creepy while the locals warn him of werewolves. Eventually he has enough of Orlok and escapes. Meanwhile Orlok having purchased the house is now coming to Wisborg.This movie has a lot of iconic images like Max Schreck's Count Orlok. It's also throwing everything in here like the bugs and venus flytraps. The movie has set up all the basic cinematic visuals from the classic Bram Stoker novel. The effects are terrific for its time. For a silent movie, it is actually very enjoyable to watch. There is good tension and compelling drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not just a great horror movie. It's a poem of horror, a symphony of dread, a film so rapt, mysterious and weirdly lovely it haunts the mind long after it's over. A landmark motion picture. Is like standing in the same room as death itself. It is difficult to watch Nosferatu simply because it is so hard to find a decent copy of the film. His body is twisted and perverted, gnarling in on itself and constantly invading the personal space of the people around him. Still one of the scariest, most unnerving films ever made. Nosferatu is an important piece of cinema history, featuring innovative direction, remarkable make-up and a genuinely chilling atmosphere. The movie's best effect is its star...He looks every bit like an actual demonic wild-thing, retrieved from deep within the German wilderness and trotted out to perform for Murnau's camera. It is the sort of thing one could watch at midnight without its having much effect upon one's slumbering hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Re-released for Halloween this year, F.W Murnau's 'Nosferatu' is a beautiful and chilling piece of silent cinema that set the foundation of the Gothic cinematic tradition.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1922, 'Nosferatu' was, essentially, an unofficial adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula novel. Disguising the film under original names and details, this Dracula story portrays Count Orlok negotiating a move to Bremen with realtor Thomas Hutter; and like the plagued-diseased rats of history, the Nosferatu is, naturally, a harbinger of death; bringing a great darkness with him in as he obsessively pursues the neck of Hutter's wife.Masterfully directed, timeless images of the nocturnal blood sucker gravitating through the shadows - as one with the dark ? will send chills down your spine; uninvintingly locking themselves away in the darker side of your memory. Max Schreck's Count Orlok grotesques all with his rat-like physical demeanor and extending claws; the epitome being the iconic shot of the shadow ascending the stairs. You feel a sense of unexplainable elegance to the shot; not just because of it's iconic status and cultural significance. It is pure Gothic horror; unnerving through it's sheer visual majesty. This is a vampire you won't be accustomed to seeing if you have been a regular viewer of the the shirtless escapades present in the 'Twilight' films. Nosferatu is not exactly heart-warming, buff or sexy. More, a pale stick insect which has just crawled out of a rat hole. Edward Cullen and family like transparent architecture, with their expensive, modern real estate. Nosferatu prefers his abode to be a beautifully haunting, Bavarian castle.Their is a great charm in seeing one camera techniques pioneered. Film was still a relatively new art-form and 'Nosferatu' pushed that art forward through it's usage and merging of light, subject and camera to create truly oppressive atmosphere. Not even Francis Ford Coppola, or the great Werner Herzog, could create the same sense of mysticism. Could it suggest the invention of sound recording has been a detraction of quality? No, but I certainly can't see how dialogue would have improved the film. It just shows how great Murnau's grasp of the visuals are; his impressionist images effecting audiences for nearly 100 years. Coppola's and Herzog's interpretations of the Dracula myth are both great films in their own right, and there are many more Dracula stories I can watch with certain satisfaction, but non can do what this original vampire movie did: scare me. All the fabulous cinematic innovations that occupy our screens today do nothing in comparison to one inspired performance in 1922 from Max Shreck, playing the physical embodiment of all things foul. For this reason, he takes his rightful place as one of the greatest movie monsters to grace celluloid.Stoker's heirs sued over 'Nosferatu' and the devastating ruling ordered all copies to be destroyed. But, like the movies iconic monster, it seems the film is immortal. One print survived. Because of that one print, we all have the privilege of indulging ourselves in this classical Gothic pleasure. Which many of us, to our disgrace, have not done. Unless you are a film student, forced to digest and evaluate the importance of a silent movie classic, I doubt you have been casually watching 'Nosferatu' when Halloween comes around. Time has left it behind, but thanks to the Masters of Cinema re-release and the film's triumphant return to cinema's this Halloween with the BFI's Gothic season, it can take it's place on everyone's collection shelf as, not only a historically significant piece of filmmaking, but a great, casual viewing experience that everyone can appreciate.Go to hughesreviews.co.uk to see the original article and more reviews!</fullReview>

Yesterday I did try to watch this in early morning before work but I could not get into for some reason , I did turn it off about 20 minutes into the movie. When I got back from work, I gave it another go in full this time. For being first Vampire movie, it was really good and some very cool creepy moments in this movie. I loved those shadow scenes. The vampire it's self was really creepy for time and for a PG movie and I didn't mind the whole reading scenes but when they were writing, I could not make some of handwriting which did bother me also I didn't like how scene were moved very slowly, It kinda of annoying.

		<fullReview>I just wouldn't be making my own stuff if it wasn't for this film and I doubt I am alone in that as it's influence is still strong all these years later. A stunning work of visual art, so glad it wasn't actually destroyed when they tried. The use of light and dark, casting shadows in particular is exceptional. Very much an excellent example of the Expressionist movement of it's day. The fact that this film is up for another release almost a century after it was made is testament to it's beauty, influence and artistry. Even with it's deviations from the plot it is still my favorite, if unofficial adaption of Dracula, and likely still my favorite vampire design with it's creepy rodent qualities adding to the unnerving feel of the entire piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Terrifying Horror Piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even after almost nine decades, F. W. Murnau's film remains a classic of horror cinema. The film contains some genuinely shocking moments, especially when Hutter (Gustav v. Wangenheim) comes to visit Graf Orlok (aka Nosferatu's) lair. Played by Max Schreck, Nosferatu is a genuinely creepy monster; with adept use of - at that time radical - cinematic techniques, director Murnau shows how he can reappear and disappear at will. No one appears to be able to resist him; his demise at the end of the film is mostly due to hubris - the belief that he is somehow indestructible. MOSFERATU also contains some memorable images: the rats moving in and around Nosferatu's coffin; the plague-ridden street, with coffins coming out of various doors; the lonely dog-cart moving slowly across a desolate landscape towards Nosferatu's castle. The version I saw had been recently restores (2010), with a new score and the original German title-cards (with English translations). Happily enough, the translations do not attempt to popularize the film by renaming Nosferatu Dracula.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You start it, expecting some outdated piece of cinema, but you get a chilling peace of history. This movie will stick in your memory for years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nosferatu is one of the most influential horror movies ever made, and many movies own a lot to it, even it they don't know it. Even if Nosferatu isn't Original (More or less stolen from Dracula), it's still worth a watch and set the less popular image of a monster vampire instead of the other often handsome vampire (who own a lot to Stoker and Bela Lugosi). If you want a movie that still have the roots in German expressionism with out going nuts with it, this is the movie of it, there's scenes that keeps it pure, like shadows and certain camera angels, but unlike Doctor Caligari, I don't feel like it's go to the surreal. I don't think there's any need to summarize the plot since many people above me done it before. But i want to give huge credit to Max Schreck for the role of Orlok, he and Lugosi are the best actors when it comes to Dracula. I would also want to give credit to Alexander Granach, he made Renfield / Knock feel very alive, even 91 years later. If you watch this movie, turn down the lights, grab a drink, and just relax and let this creepy movie eat you, i would recommend watching many different editions of this movie, since the different musical scores give a different exercise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Influential Silent Horror Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An unofficial adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula but also the most influential amongst all vampire films ever made, Nosferatu is an eerie, creepy, Gothic &amp; haunting cinema that may not look frightening enough from today's standards but its chilling atmosphere can still rival the best of what modern film industry has to offer in the genre of horror.Set in the fictitious German city of Wisborg, the story of Nosferatu concerns Hutter; a real estate agent, who travels to Transylvania to meet his new client only to find his journey full of strange occurrences &amp; later discovers that he just sold a new residence to not a human but a vampire who after arriving to the new place expresses an interest in Hutter's innocent wife.A silent horror that benefits greatly from a brilliantly written screenplay that was then superbly executed on screen by its classy direction, excellent use of expressionism from its cast, especially Max Schreck who plays vampire Count Orlok, inventive cinematography, smart editing, powerfully haunting music as well as clever use of its uncanny locations.Almost a century has passed since Nosferatu first surfaced on the film canvas &amp; it holding strong even today is a testament to the strength &amp; visual appeal of this silent classic. On an overall scale, Nosferatu is one of the finest works of art that didn't just commence the effective horror genre but also slightly altered the legacy of vampire mythology, forever. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>due to the lack of availability of this film it took me ten years to find it.. so after a long wait, I watched it and I liked it particularly the music, now watching the American cousin-- Dracula 1st I noticed that some of what was in 1931 Dracula was not in 1922 nosferatu. I don't know quite how to asses this. the 31 version seems more complete but yet in 1922 a lot of what was available 9 years later had an input,, yea I could follow the story,, it seemed like certain scenes parts were left out.. or was it that Dracula added scenes.. hard to tell,, this version I feel is darker than the American cousin. the music definitely better. I feel that if I watch this one again I will like it more and upgrade my 8 to a 10 i'm sure of that.. being from Germany I didn't realize FW Morneau talent'ts for the silent film,, he did a wonderful job with this I really did enjoy the movie,, kinda wish it was available before I watched Dracula.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iconic film character alert! Everyone knows this guy. In fact, after a night on the tiles, some of us have woken up looking like Nosferatu (and indeed walking like him too, if curry was involved). To be honest though, after seeing clips of this and all the parodies and homages and what not, I wasn't even sure if I had seen the film or not, but I've watched it now and am glad to say that even though it's roughly a couple of hundred years old, it's great!Johnathon Harker, estate agent, is sent by his boss Renfield to Transalvania, where he's to sell a house to Count Dracula (in the version I had anyway). He's only taken so far by the locals, who leave him outside the 'land of phantoms'. Not before long a creepy carriage picks him up and drops him outside of the castle, where the Count reads over a letter from Renfield, and then tries to drink his blood when Harker cuts his finger.Harker's a bit confused by this, and even more confused when he wakes up in the morning with a sore neck, but shrugs it off (the guy playing him is a bit goofy, at least for the first half of the film). Thanks to a handy 'Vampires for idiots' book that he's found, Harker discovers that the guy who sleeps all day, likes blood, and remarked about how Harker's wife had a lovely neck is actually a vampire! And he was hiding it so well! Worse still, Harker's now trapped in the castle and Dracula (or Nosferatu or Orlock) is bound for Bremen in boat full of soon to be dead sailors. Can Harker make it back in time?Apart from the phrase "German Expressionism" I know nothing about German Expressionism, but if that means loads of mood, shadows, Gothic atmosphere, long fingernails, swooning, images of coffins being carried through the streets, then I'm all for it. This film was a blast from start to finish, with nary a moment wasted. If I had a time machine I'd back to 1922 and say 'mad props' to Max Schreck, whatever that means.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nosferatu (1922)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nosferatu is a classic vampire movie. Count Orlok, the vampire, moves from his home in Transylvania to a town in Germany. Here Orlok hopes to find easy prey, naive to the threat of vampires. Once the count arrive in Germany people thought a plague was causing all the deaths, but Hutter's wife Ellen knows better. She knew Orlok was a vampire and in the end sacrificed herself in order to put an end to all of the deaths. I went to a screening of this film where there was a live band that played. Since the film is silent, it was the band job to make the move come alive. The band definitely did their job, and made me really appreciate the film and their talent. I give this film an 8 out of 10 because it's a great silent film, especially if seen with a live band. If you ever have the chance to see Nosferatu with a band I would recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A symphony of horror indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1922 was when vampires were vampires not horny emotional teenagers with big teeth unlike Twilight. Nosferatu was directed by F.W. Murnau and starting Max Schreck as the Count Orlok. It's a chilling and eerie adaption of Stoker's Dracula, following the same plot somewhat and ever since it has first came to the screens in 1922, it has become a silent masterpiece of terror which to this day is the most striking and frightening portrayal of the legend. The old grainy black and white footage, and low frames per second recording somehow add to the creepiness of this film. Since it's public domain though, there have been several different re-releases over the years, a lot of which have music and voice overs that just seems out of place. It's hard to decide, when there is so many version of the film. There is a version where the music by Type O Negative?somewhere. Some of the campy music; there are moments when the tension of the music doesn't even fit what's happening on the screen. It's sad to watch. The original music was more Gothic in nature and better fit the feel for the movie. The music was originally composed by Hans Erdmann but the score was never recorded. This song is by far the greatest soundtrack to this movie! All the re-mastered versions suck! Not only did the remastered versions mess up the score, but also the picture by making it gold and blue. One problem in the film, is you can't really tell the different between night and day in this film? so it's better to have it black and white for the picture. W. Murnau originally filmed Nosferatu in a color tinted version not black and white, for instance Murnau shot the night scenes in a blue tint and the day ones in a gold tint which really works at the end of film with the rising of the sun. The Kino DVD of Nosferatu is really beautiful. It's amazing how great actors had to be, by telling the story by body expressing. Max Schreck acting in Nosferatu is chilling. The Orlok make-up is so timeless. He doesn't close his eyes at any time during the film, which I find rather creepy. He was an eccentric who took his parts so seriously he remained in character during the entire shoot. Max was already known for his quirky and often seen as weird or obscure habits. He was a loner who enjoyed playing grotesque characters and mainly lived in his own world. It's a trait that adds to Schreck's macabre appearance. The other actors acting are somewhat slow and awkward. Gustav v. Wangenheim is just awful as Hutter. Makes you appreciate this classic! Interesting thing is that the name credits in this B&amp;W film at the beginning are a bit off because Murnau didn't use any of the character's names from the original Stoker novel when he filmed Nosferatu so Bram Stoker's widow wouldn't sue him and his company, (she did though) which is why in the original German titles you have names like 'Graff Orlock' instead of Count Dracula and 'Hutter' in place of Harker and 'Ellen' in place of Mina. Only very loosely based on Bram Stoker's novel, which, I guess would have been too complex to make a film of without dialogue - and is probably over-complex anyway. It's better than Dracula somewhat. Thank goodness that the widow of Bram Stoker couldn't burn all the film due to the suing of Nosferatu. We are lucky to see this film due to that. True horror enters the soul and disturbs us, like a insecure feeling of helplessness. This film holds those emotions after all these years, it still frightens many people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I enjoyed this as a "modern" movie enthusiast with no knowledge about German expressionism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Nosferatu is the way it combines quality storytelling with moments of insight to contemporary filmmaking; even the most mundane and obvious occurrences require a strong emphasis of movement and facial expressions to properly depict a story with no sound. Above all else, this piece of German expressionism is a fascinating remnant from an era where the tropes and possibilities of the horror genre or filmmaking in general had yet to be established. In that regard, Murnau's vampiric tale from 1922 is of great historic value based on its reputation and influential nature alone. A question of relevance, however, is whether its ability to appeal and affect has been lost over the years; which is not the case in my personal opinion. Based on Bram Stoker's 'Dracula', the story accounts for a strange series of events in the fictional town of Wisborg where the protagonist Thomas Hutter lives with his wife Ellen. As he embarks on a journey to meet count Orlok and fulfill his duties as a real estate agent, certain irregularities lead him to believe that his client is no ordinary human being. As his suspicions turn out to be true he desperately hurries back to assure the safety of his wife and stop Nosferatu from making his demonic entrance into a town of innocent villagers.The narrative makes progress at a pace far slower than modern viewers might be used to but makes sure to remain focused, relevant and clear. Moments that fail to achieve any form of importance are easily forgiven as they tend to observe either architecture or hauntingly eerie forests at midnight. Whilst the picture quality is naturally muddled, the creepy and still effective visuals that rely on atmospheric shadowing and angles make the movie as a whole surprisingly approachable even 90 years after its release. You quickly get the impression that this is no hastily written Dracula rip-off but rather the creation of a pioneer with a strong sense of affection for the medium he's chosen. The director even created an epidemic plot device that does not exist in the original novel and adds perfectly to the narrative.Musically, an assessment is hard to make since the original score is mainly lost and several versions have been made ever since. As for my own viewing, I got an incredibly moody and appropriate soundtrack that more or less carried the entire movie on its shoulders and saved me from distractions and boredom. Another virtue of this creation is the excellent casting choice of Max Shreck as the antagonist. As previously mentioned, most actors need to deliver their performances in rather exaggerated manners in favor of coherence whilst count Orlok movies in an awkward, stale, and incredibly creepy manner. Most people have probably seen images or clips from some of the more iconic scenes that depict his ominous ascent in the stairway or perhaps the way he arises from his coffin ? depictions that modern filmmakers still see as a source of inspiration.To sum things up, this is an old movie. It lacks the knowledge of modern visual techniques and devices but fares almost admiringly well without the tropes we cherish today. Gothic and beautiful book pages are scattered throughout the entire film to inform us of vampiric characteristics; formulated as poetically and hauntingly as possible. Each and every aspect of the film, from weird coloring to expressionist acting and Gothic approach adds to the insanely refreshing classical horror feel where you root for the potential victims rather than the antagonist.In many regards, classics are overrated. Criticizing them even on an amateurish level has become a cinematic taboo that most critics and individuals avoid. Nosferatu, on the other hand, sincerely deserves the vast amount of praise it has received; it's one of the few hauntingly grisly and poetic pieces of Gothic filmmaking that chose to tell a vampire tale in an era where it was neither predictable or clich. I mean that as a most sincere compliment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early Silent Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is fine but it's dated and silent even without music to help move the film along. The actors and actresses did a fine job without a script. The film isn't as frightening today as it might have been in it's time period in 1922. The story unfolds slowly and carefully about the legend of vampires in Transylvania. There is a twist at the end of the story. The Nosferatu is the vampire whose legend unfolds in this film. This film is dark in black and white and appropriately too. The length is only about an hour and that's fine. It's interesting to see how audiences would have reacted to it's initial release. The story of a man who sells a house in Bremen, Germany in Pre-World War II time to the mysterious Count is chilling at times. It's sometimes better to see without speaking in the silent film genre. It's a classic thriller in it's time period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing and artful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nosferatu a German expressionist horror film. It is one of the first silent films I ever viewed. I found it to be emotional,creepy, disturbing, artful, and beautiful. By far my favorite vampire film. Although this is a silent film the eerie music,strong sexual subtext, and the use of fast-motion and negative photography makes the film very visually pleasing and captivating. Fritz Arno Wagner brings terror out of silhouettes. It's definitely more haunting than scary. Of course thew best seen is Orlok is standing in the doorway of Hutter's bedroom. Overall Nosferatu is a iconic, emotional and visual treat. My biggest gripe is it is very difficult to find a decent copy of the film.</fullReview>

Schnell, Ruth Landshoff, John Gottowt, Gustav Botz, Max Nemetz, Wolfgang Heinzusa, Heinrich Witte, Guido Herzfeld, Karl Etlinger, Hardy von Francois and Fanny Schreck.Directed By:F. W. Murnau.Review:So a few weeks back i spotted this movie and a few others available on Youtube. i got really excited because the fact that i don't get to see very old movies like these, this was such a lovely thing to watch a movie that basically started it all, the Vampire themed movies. you will see shadows and hear echoes of this movie in many of the modern day movies like these. while i only heard about it and knew nothing about whatsoever i saw it. was really stunned at how great this movie was. it indeed was if i remember correctly, my first ever experience of a Black White Silent movie and since it released in 1922, the most oldest one ever. loved watching this movie very much.To be honest i have not much to say about this movie but still i will try. so i really respect silent movies and consider them truly great experience. they don't shove things down your throats or just keep on throwing things at you but they let you experience and feel the movie, feel and think about everything that goes on in the movie, it is just a whole lot different experience. something that stays with you for a while while those images still lingers in your mind as you really focus into the imagery throughout the movie. this is not a actual adaptation of the novel but that doesn't bother me and nor should anyone else. it is what it is and i love Murau's take on Nosferatu or Vampire Count Dracula (Orlok). this was a great movie where you see from the start the lovely couple, with a beautiful wife and they are in love which is then challenged by Orlok as he claims her later on. i thought it was technically the best Black and White movie i saw of the era lately. it is just well done in every aspect even being so old, i am stunned by how well the details and technical aspects have been taken care of. it moves at a very fine pace or in some places fast. i don't think i found any noticeable flaws in the movie.Everything is good about this movie, Max Schreck looks creepy and quite convincing as the Count Orlok and he does scares and creeps you out. a really scary and almost irresistible portrayal. Gustav Von Wangenheim really performed well too while Greta Schroder looked nice but quite confusing at times. Directed very well and screenplay was good. Art direction and cinematography were excellent. i loved that hilarious sequence that looks so funny when Orlok arrives in the town running with his coffin in his hand. and in other scene looked creepy but rather heroic standing on that ship with everyone dead and looking forward to the fact that he was going to get Hutter's wife who he finds beautiful. many sequences were actually scary and quite creepy. i loved the whole atmosphere of this movie. it is rather enjoyable and very lovable as it ends you feel like you just watched a high budget action Sci Fi movie. creepy and scary sequences with one of the very best or actually the best portrayal of a Vampire or Dracula i have seen. this is a must watch.Rating:4.5/5A-Follow My Blog: HollywoodAndMe.Blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where the vampire genre all began</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is where the long legacy of Dracula films begins. F.W. Murnau's classic, Nosferatu, is said to be one of the most terrifying adaptations of Bram Stoker's novel ever made. It is a silent film German from 1922, not released in the states until 1929 because it was rumoured to be some sort of German propaganda, not something the United States wanted floating around the country in the midst of World War I. Of course, the film is nothing of the sort. It tells the story of Hutter, a real estate agent who visits the Campire Count Orlok's castle in Transylvania after Orlok expresses interest in taking up residence near Hutter. Hutter quickly learns that the Count has a dark secret, and so unfolds a tale of terror as Count Orlok wreaks havoc on Hutter's unsuspecting home town.By 1922's standards this film is absolutely horrific and incredibly dark. By the standards of the 21st century it's hard to still see this film as frightening, but it is indeed still dark. It tells a bleak tale, one of sorrow and misery, without anything to lighten the mood. It begins cheerily enough. Hutter and his wife live a peaceful existence in their town. They are deeply in love and they have a substantial income to make their lives as easygoing as possible. But things take a turn for the worst as soon as Hutter agrees to visit the dangerous Count Orlok. The film only grows colder and darker from there, never shedding a hopeful light on the harrowing situation the characters of this film find themselves in. Even towards the end when the film seems like it might end happily, it takes a dark twist that ends it on a very somber and unfortunate note. This is truly astounding for a film made so long ago.I said that this film isn't very scary by our standards anymore, but that doesn't mean that the image of Count Orlok isn't disturbingly memorable. The images of Orlok as the full fledge vampire, Nosferatu, are deeply unsettling and he is a figure that you cannot easily shake from your mind. The make up is excellent and the hauntingly slow paced way Max Schreck portrays the Count is perfect. He is an incredibly ominous figure, standing up at least six feet tall, dressed in a powerful black robe that contradicts his eerily pale skin. Schreck also wears giant prosthetic hands which are half human half beast, in a way. They are massive hands with claw like structures on the fingers, and when Schreck stretches these hands out it makes Nosferatu that much more feared and all the more intimidating. Nosferatu's image is something that should be revered forever in the world of vampires.And what a vast world that is. Vampires have been falling in and out of popular culture ever since this film. We now have countless vampire movies, plenty of vampire book series, and even a plethora of vampire television shows. And what's amazing to think is that this 80 minute German film from 1922 is what started this entire legacy, other than the book it is based on of course. Any visual rendition of the Dracula story and any film or television show centered around vampires owes so much to Nosferatu, much more than they are likely aware of. Vampires are practically their own genre these days, and its all thanks to this film. Nosferatu spawned a legacy that, just like the film's title character, will likely never die.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me it was more than a movie. Only a strange experience and a deep travel. Beautiful and harsh, delicate and bitter, a kind of jewelery and definition of life, about abdications and small gesture, about love as a cinnamon bread, it is one of films in which every word is only skin of a invisible snake. Max Shrek is magnificent. And the mixture between director and Isherwood is a really surprise. A story about a gay professor is , in fact, map of ordinary searches. So, the nuances are all.The orange slices, the usual gesture, the faces, remains of past, shadow of lost person and the kiss as key of different levels of a single world. Gustav von Wangenheim is the same. Und Greta Schrder is the secret ingredient. A film like a piece of Chaplin in the skin of Mahler. A game in fall colors , with small toy, in a glass house.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Accurate, Most Unsettling Dracula to Date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anybody familiar with Stoker's "Dracula" (from which this film is blatantly lifted) already knows the story. Hutter (aka Harker) travels to Transylvania at his employer's request in order to finalize the sale of an estate to Count Orlok (aka Count Dracula). He is held prisoner at the Count's decrepit, ruinous castle (drained nightly of blood), which he narrowly escapes with his life. Now, injured and feverish, he must make his way back home to warn his beloved Ellen (aka Mina) of the creature which now stalks her. The film is notably more accurate than the official (and canonical) 1931 adaptation with Bela Lugosi (which is primarily taken from a 1924 theatrical adaptation of the novel).I have yet to find a more unnerving villain (vampire or otherwise) than Count Orlok (Max Shreck). Unlike Bela Lugosi's suave and charismatic Dracula or Brad Pitt's (sym)pathetic Louis, Shreck's Orlok is completely inhuman. His appearance alone is revolting: long, bony fingers ending in talon-like nails - white-washed pale face - pointed ears - dark, sunken eyes - rat-like fangs centered in the very front of his mouth (indeed, rats were the bestial motif of choice in the film, spreading plague throughout Germany after Orlok's arrival -- a fitting metaphor for vampirism itself). Orlok moves with expressionistic intent: jiltingly, stiffly and unnaturally.The scenes in which he moves across a ship's deck (backdropped by white sails) or where his imposing shadow (gnarled hand outstretched) creeps up a staircase toward Ellen are among the film's most memorable and most frightening. Fans of Dracula (the novel, the films and the cultural icon), vampires and expressionist films will find this highly-stylized feature an unnerving and truly frightening masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nosferatu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nosferatu was the first horror film. It was the first vampire film. It also has a wide number of admirers from Roger Ebert to Werner Herzog. It is adapted from Bram Stoker's Dracula. For some reason it is one of the few films from the silent era that still has a wide following. Nosferatu gives us an image of the vampire. We see him as a lonely man. We see him as sad. His wealth has no real value for him. The movie begins with a traditional love story but the way Murnau depicts it gives it beauty. The flower scene is very beautiful and later where the woman asks him " Why did you kill the lovely flowers?" juxtaposes the two scenes well. Murnau said that in the future there would be a lot of use of camera angles to tell a story. He says people will film thoughts and that is what Murnau does throughout the movie. He is filming thought. The shots of the seas, stormy and calm, the beautiful shot of the Venus Fly trap and various other similar shots. You can see how much Herzog was influenced by Murnau's style of storytelling.Visually this film is out of this world. It has tremendous beauty to it. Maybe because films in the silent era had to concentrate more on the visual aspect then the dialogue and plot lines but I don't think we would see such a movie today.I love watching these old movies. They have such simplicity to them and in that simplicity lies much of their charm. The scene of Nosferatu just behind that barred window is typical of this simplicity. I think it has to be watched a couple of time for it to sink in if you are new to silent film as I am. Some scenes hold more meaning when you see them as a whole and look more beautiful after the first viewing.The music is quite beautiful and if goes with mood perfectly. There is not a misplaced note in the score and I think the score is a work of art in its own right.Nosfeartu is one of Murnau's masterpieces and is a landmark of the silent era. Made almost a century ago it is still relevant as a film today. Maybe the plot has aged a little but that is not a problem. But visually the film can be watched and re watched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First Dracula, and One of the Greatest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a blatant ripoff of "Dracula", Count Orlok (Max Schreck) moves from Transylvania to Germany, where he sets up base... only to raise havoc wherever he goes, with death and destruction in his wake."Nosferatu" is a great film, and a must-see for any horror fan or film historian. The film is legendary not only for its early portrayal of Bram Stoker's Dracula, but the legal battle that ensued -- at one point, all copies were ordered destroyed, so it is a small miracle the film exists today at all.Max Schreck has been memorialized for his role as Orlok (and for a fictionalized account of this, see "Shadow of the Vampire"). Alexander Granach, the actor who plays Knock (a Renfield knockoff), is also excellent. Director F. W. Murnau would go on to make the critically acclaimed "Sunrise", but he was already experimenting with camera tricks here, and I daresay this is his better-known film. Truly a masterpiece, both then and now.Numerous versions of the film exist for the reason that it is in the public domain, and various degrees of quality come with them -- some are cleaned up better, have different intertitles, and drastically different scores. I do not have a strong enough knowledge to suggest one over another other than to say the Netflix version is not among the best. Also, if you care about quality, avoid watching it in a box set -- as little restoration as possible has been done on those versions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Noir Ancestor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The frights in this film may be contrary to what we are use to today, but I'm sure the audiences back then got a chill with the authentic and Gothic world of Nosferatu. While this film may not be considered very scary for our time, this film does experiment with techniques that would go on to influence the horror genre. Also the uses of black and white as well as lighting added not to just a horror atmosphere but a noir one as well. The use of contrasting black and white palettes and the use of shadows are early signs of the noir genre. Dracula could be seen as the murder in a noir gangster film. He even wears a dark jacket like those in dark gangster or other noir films. I also appreciated the metaphor of Dracula as death, referring to the German people's feeling about World War I. Dracula represents the death to the countries young and innocent. This film also managed to stay entertaining through all ninety four minutes of silent cinema. The dark settings were excellent set pieces for the dark terror. They created this Gothic reality the audience nor the characters could escape. However, the sets also give a certain real feel with the town locations. While many of the performances are whimsical and a little over the top, Max Schreck delivers a chilling and creepy performance as Dracula. Overall I believe this is a well done, entertaining old school silent film. A film that belongs to cinema art for its influences and ideas to horror and noir filmmakers and films alike. The story is faithful to the idea of Dracula, and the acting overall is reasonable for a silent film. The cinematography is this films strong suit, which is where other films have drawn most of their inspirations. A film forever remembered by cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nosferatu Linked To WWI</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nosferatu, I thought, was a great film. After watching and analyzing it, it is easy to see the direct relatedness to WWI. The eeriness, the sense of not knowing, and suspense are all common factors in which people feel undergoing war. Nosferatu demonstrates how closely related film of that era was to politics brought about by the war. They effectively show how WWI is directly linked to the German expressionist movement. This movement then later sparked rise of the postwar horror genre. World War I not only paved the way for many filmmakers to come, but it changed German silent cinema forever. During F. W. Murnau's film, the main character, Hutter, leaves his plague-infested town to meet Graf Orlak, who later is deemed to be a vampire. After waking up, Hutter realizes who Graf Orlak really is. Hutter then must race against time to get back home in order to save his wife from Orlak. The setting of the plagued town is easily comparable to the setting of WWI?just set in a different time period. In both, innocent people died, and there was nothing the average person could do to stop neither sickness nor death. Orlak symbolizes the war itself, while the main character embodies Germany. Germany sought out the war, but in the end the war retaliated and came after Germany. In the end of the movie, Orlak dies once subjected to the sunlight. The sun rising symbolizes a new coming, specifically for Germany. Orlak is killed by this new coming which can be interpreted as a foreshadow that Germany would try once again to win another war, WWII. This film was great, it was ahead of its time and forever impacted German Cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror: This was the first horror movie before horror movies were called horror movies. This was also the first vampire movie and the start of this genre. I believe that people in 1929 found this movie somewhat frightening, but compared to the violence and horror of today's movie this movie was dual and boring to me. This movie related to the aftermath of World War I Nosferatu was the plague on Europe and was the filling around Europe after World War I. Spoiler Alert The story begins when Knock (Hutter's boss) convince Hutter to travel Transylvania to meet with Count Orlok and convince the count to buy the house across from Hutter. After arriving in Transylvania Hutter meets with Orlok and shows him the paper work on the house. During his stay, Orlok unfortunately bites Hutter. Hutter later discovers that nothing is what it seems. He finds that Orlok sleeping in a coffin. Before he can confront the Count about it, the Count packs his coffins and leaves for Hutter's town. Once the count arrives in Hutter's town people start to die the town believes that the deaths are the work of the plague. After Ellen (Hutter's wife) finds the book on Nosferatu, she knows how to stop the vampire. That night she invites the vampire in and gives herself willing to him. Because of this Orlok forgets to leave before the morning light and is destroyed by the sunlight ending the plague on the city. All in all this was a well crafted story using real locations something not seen this early in film making. Like I said the movie did not frightening to me but when you show, something like this to people that has never seen anything like it before you could spook a lot of people. You just never know if that creepy house across town has another Nosferatu hiding in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The vampire in the beginning of the film was really unsettling for me (I'm not a big fan of horror movies), and when he sucks the blood of Hutter when he cuts his thumb, it was a little shocking. I really liked the use of shadows in the film when the vampire is just about to come into the room in the middle of the night to suck the blood of his guest. The shadows were a warning of something bad about to happen and was also mysterious because you couldn't exactly, at first, see who was casting the shadow. I almost laughed when he climbs into his coffin to sleep at night, it just seemed like a stereotypical thing for a vampire to do, so it makes you go "of course." The end of the film is the climax, you are just waiting to see if he will really kill Hutter's wife and you are on the edge of your seat, rooting for something to go wrong so that this woman's life is saved. When the vampire does disappear in a puff of smoke, the image of his castle is now a castle that is destroyed, which is supposed to symbolize the end of the vampire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Over all the silent films of the world and especially German Expressionist cinema, Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror F.W. Murnau, Germany 1922, 94 min.) sticks out the most to me. Murnau continually proves to be a genius director that has influenced both German Cinema and Cinema on a global level. Nosferatu is a story based off the classic novel Count Dracula. Fun fact of the day, the film was actually sued for copy right because of its illegal adaption of Count Dracula.Young Hutter travels east to Count Orlok's castle in Transylvania for business. The Count turns out to be a vampire and travels west to obtained Hutter's wife, Ellen. The town is soon plagued with death and the only way to defeat the Count depends on Ellen's self-sacrifice.The genius of the film starts in the script and creative direction. Nosferatu becomes more then a horror film like Dracula, but is a leading example in German Expressionism as it parallels characters and situations to experiences in World War 1. One scene that truly embodied this analogy was the scene of caskets being carried down the town street. This image was a common one as women watched the caskets of their men who were sacrifice in war.Murnau introduces stunning editing techniques including the use of speeding up the pace and using negatives to provide symbolic imagery. The ability to defy space and time through editing is one rarely, if not ever, seen before. I highly suggest this classic film to anyone no matter their taste in genres.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>F.W. Murnau's 'Dracula'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As many of you know, the creators of the film set out to adapt Bam Stroker's 'Dracula.' But owing to the fact that they could not acquire the rights to the infamous and iconic novel, they changed certain details, including the names of the characters and the setting, and the result was a movie that turned out to be different from the novel in certain elements, but nevertheless retained the its soul. Nosferatu was made by F.W. Murnau, one of the greatest directors of the silent era. With this movie, he flaunts his skills in terrorizing his audience with the atmospheric build-up of tension. The film is an archetypical horror falling under the umbrella of German Expressionism, finding its route in the iconic 'Dr. Caligari's Cabinet.' Some scholars contend that the film is an expression of the jarring experience of World War I, which took a toll on the people of Germany. Modern audiences may not find the movie very exciting or 'scary,' being desensitized by the gore and the violence of contemporary horrors and slasher films. However, Nosferatu does not rely on gore or shock to begin with; its horror is derived from the aforementioned atmospheric build-up of tension. Throughout the film, there is a foreboding sense of doom and lingering chaos that finally erupts in the climax. This film reminds me of Roman Polanski's classic horror film 'Rosemary's Baby' because of its portrayal of horror through psychological rather than visual means. That's not to say that Count Orlok (the counterpart to Bam Stroker's Count Dracula) isn't scary looking. In closing, I would like to say this: don't watch this movie if you are looking to get thrilled, because you are more likely to come out underwhelmed. However, if you like classic silent movies, or are interested in exploring the roots of psychological horror, this is a movie you should definitely not want to miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE Vampire Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vampires have come along way since the days of Nosferatu. Now they are our friends, they sparkle, and are the object of female desire. I can't imagine anyone in the film wanting to be with Max Schreck, or see him as some sort of object of sexual desire. Anyway, that is a bit of an aside, but it means that Schreck is quite effective. Actually more than effective he is terrifying. He lumbers around slowing, with his long arms hanging by his side, not speaking, praying on the living. The story follows a young man, Thomas Hutter, as he visits the castle of Nosferatu, after leaving bringing the vampire hot on his heels. The look of the film is really eerie. It was a foggy feel to it and a camera that lingers on the subjects as they are subjected to impended doom. The lighting is rather beautiful; Schreck's shadow is cast on walls with a certain foreboding. Nosferatu's arrival brings the black plague, which sweeps through the town, wiping it out. The filmmakers do a bang up job of making the town seem empty. There are later shots of coffins at dawn slowly crawling down the streets, the dead being carried away from the town. Hutter and his wife figure out, by reading the book of Vampires how to kill Nosferatu and succeed in doing so. This is how you make a horror film, there are no modern day jump scares, it is completely atmospheric. The viewer is placed into a town and left to watch the vampire as he wreaks havoc. There is no wink, nod to the audience. He moves slows and doesn't present much a threat but at the same time does, he is unpredictable and while he is terrifying looking, it is hard to draw your attention away from him. Horror films don't scare me and this didn't scare me either. But I can appreciate the atmosphere of the film and what the filmmakers were attempting to accomplish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the origin of the vampire flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time i saw Nosferatu was when i was flipping channels late one Halloween night and stopped on TCM. I missed the very beginning but watched the movie all the way through. I have found that films i stumble across on accident are in many instances the best ones i ever see and Nosferatu is no exception. The film is a thinly disguised adaptation of the novel Dracula by Bram Stoker. It tells the story of a young naive real estate agent named Harker (in some translations) who unwittingly is sent to sell a house to the vampire Count Orlok. Orlok buys the house and travels to Harkers home town bringing with him a devastating plague. While the film is sometimes dismissed because of its being a silent movie, i would argue that the fact that it is a silent film makes it even scarier than if the film had sound dialog. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes dark films or wants to research early special effects.If you enjoy this film i would also recommend the remake of Nosferatu made in 1979 and a early sound vampire film called vampyr. This is just a little side note, but i have never seen Nosferatu with the same subtitles twice its really quite strange.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great creepy atmosphere ? Left me wanting more though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As most people know, this is Murnau's version of Dracula. To try and dodge copyright laws, he changed all of the character's names from Bram Stoker's book and fiddled with the story. The end result is a very creepy, atmospheric film ? the performance of Max Schrek gives us the most disturbing portrayal of the Dracula character, one that is quite different from the suave and charming Dracula of Bela Lugosi. I've seen this movie twice now, and both times I was a little let down. Like I said, the atmosphere is great, but the story itself just left me feeling like there should have been more to it. The beginning really got me interested, but slowed down for me when Orlock leaves Transylvania. Don't get me wrong, there are some great scenes after that, such as when Orlock reveals himself on the boat or when Hutter gets a ride in a very creepy carriage, but the story or maybe the pacing just doesn't quite do if for me. The ending especially is a big let down, I was expecting something much more.Like I said, I have seen this movie twice. The first time I saw it, it was a horrible transfer with no tinting and an awful score that did not match the creepiness of the film at all. For my second viewing, I saw the Kino version, a great improvement. The transfer was beautiful, all the scenes were tinted, and the soundtrack was said to be the original score. I believe that my first viewing of Nosferatu has ruined it for me. Do not watch the version that gives the characters their original book names, it's horrible. Make sure you get the Kino version, you'll have a much better experience. Go into this with no expectations and it will probably turn out better for you than it did for me.I give this 7/10, the eeriness of it made up a lot for my disappointment in the story. I guess you could say I respect it more than I like watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Count Orlok may not terrify us as he did ninety years ago, but the image of a corpse-like vampire continues to haunt us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had an interesting reaction to F.W. Murnau's "Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror." At no point in watching this film did I feel any genuine, visceral terror. Even though it features one of the most physically off-putting characters of all time, the movie never actually gave me the shivers. That came about an hour later, as I was tossing and turning around, trying to fall asleep. Lying in that dark empty room, I kept on picturing the movie's iconic images of a corpse-like vampire crouching over his victims as they slept. I kept on imagining my closet doors as the castle passages in the film, and that at some point, they were going to swing open under their own power. One minute, they would be vacant, and the next there would be Count Orlok walking unhurriedly, striving to quench his thirst for blood. That kept me up through all hours of the night.For me, the terror came not in the actual moment of viewing, but afterward. I have seen "Nosferatu" four or five times in the past couple of years, and each time, it has registered the same effect on me. It has a haunting quality that cannot be ignored, even if it is not as viscerally gripping as it probably was to the people who first saw it ninety years ago. And although it does not make my blood pump like some other entries in the horror genre, it is not, save for a small stretch in the middle, a dull experience. It is full of unforgettable images and a quintessential, of-its-time atmosphere.Perhaps the movie's grandest achievement is the ever-going presence of its villain. And that is really saying something, seeing as how Count Orlok, the titular nosferatu, only has about ten minutes of screen time to his name. Ignoring his physical grandeur, one can feel the vampire's authority hanging over every scene like a specter. One that cannot be fought off or evaded, that is until an innocent maiden sticks her neck out (literally) to save Europe. In this sense, "Nosferatu" is a defining example of German Expressionism: an art movement prevalent in the movies as well as paintings during the 20th century in which the creator would provide an inner feeling through some distorted version of reality. And what distorted version of reality would work better than the idea of vampires: carcasses rising from the earth to feed on the flesh of the living. No matter how many times our parents remind us that these are just fictional entities, most of us can never quite shake the impression that there are some things in this world we cannot explain or expect. Especially when it's late at night, and you are all alone in a dark house.But the vampire's physical presence cannot be ignored, either. I do not know how much is owed to Max Schreck's performance as Count Orlok or the fabulous make-up work, whose creator I really wish I could name. But this is one of the most visually memorable characters in cinema history. Count Orlok is not so much a man as he is a rodent. He bears no hair of his own, pointed little ears, a narrow lower jaw eerily reminiscent of a snout, and big expressionless eyes with heavy dark shadows hanging beneath them. But best of all are the fangs, positioned smack-dab in the middle of the upper maw?again, much more like a rat than a man. Add to that Max Schreck's lean, limber posture and stiff movements (movements deliberately slow, as they are made by a creature with no reason to hurry) and Count Orlok quickly becomes visually disturbing. He may not terrify us as he did nine decades ago, but the image of a corpse-like vampire continues to haunt us.Certain elements of "Nosferatu" have dated, most of them the simple practical camera tricks that director F.W. Murnau had to utilize to suggest a supernatural element. But to his credit, he does apply them enough times so that the kitsch element wears off and we start buying them as part of this world. For instance, Count Orlok's carriage: footage of horses pulling a rig played at irregularly fast speed. By today's standards, and keeping in mind that it was very easy to over-crank a camera by accident in the silent era, the effect does look silly. As do some of the time-lapse shots of coffin lids crawling upon their boxes. Whether it was Mr. Murnau's genius or just lucky accidents, the constant usage of these tricks do eventually, as the film progresses, seem to meld it and become part of this fantasy.There is a twenty-minute stretch in the middle, as the vampire travels from Transylvania to (I believe) Germany that loses an overall sense of pacing. And a surprisingly lengthy "meanwhile back home" sequence, with a German professor lecturing about Venus fly traps is flat-out dull, in spite of its metaphors. But other than that, this is an undeniably impressive motion picture from one of the genre's greatest talents. Since the movie is available in several versions, I do feel obligated to briefly comment on them. To put it brief, get a hold of the recent, restored version by Kino International. The movie is given appropriate color tints to suggest day and night (and destroying the error of black-and-white prints in which it was clear that Nosferatu, supposed to be instantly killed by sunlight, is walking around in day without ill effect), and there are none of those added sound effects like crows cawing or doors creaking. There is one version that used these to the hilt and rendered some of the film's best moments unbearable. I'm sure there are some silent filmmaker who would have tossed in these kitschy additions to 'enhance' their movies had the technology been available to them at the time, but I doubt F.W. Murnau would have been one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My thoughts on Nosferatu...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i first heard about this movie and what it was about, i thought i was about to pee my pants when i saw it. It is often hailed as among the greatest(if not the greatest) symphony of horror" of all times(pun intended). The movie is basically "Dracula but with different names(if you want to know why it is all over the internet). Anyway, the movie succeeds in fascinating. The angles and shots were pretty cool and the scenes are memorable, such as Count Orlok(Dracula) ascending the stair case. Some of the horrors i was expecting were not terrifying for modern audiences. The major thing that made me mad was cop-out ending. Like Dracula(1931), which is often considered to be the greatest Dracula, had that same weakness. Although i was slightly disappointed, Nosferatu is a movie everyone should see, like Godfather, Casablanca, ETC. Watch it give your own opinion on this "symphony of horror".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic of the silent era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Dracula (1931) can be seen as the Anglo-American version of Bram Stoker's novel, then Nosferatu has to be the screen version of that novel seen through a European perspective. This product of German Expressionism was, like the earlier Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, highly stylized. It's a film that relies hugely on imagery. And what indelible visuals it presents. It's use of shadows and light is rightfully famous and was a huge influence on horror and film-noir movies of subsequent generations.Perhaps the oldest film in existence that truly has the power to disturb. Granted it's not exactly going to terrify modern audiences but there is something disturbing about those images of the Nosferatu; made,if anything, even more disconcerting by the aged film. Compare Max Schreck's Count Orlok to Bela Lugosi's Dracula and I defy anyone to say that the former is not more sinister. Schreck gives a truly subhuman performance. His Nosferatu is a far cry from the cultured aristocrat of future presentations of the Count. He is a devil in the devil's clothing. An irredeemably evil rat-like being. It's one of the most iconic performances from the silent age.While I actually prefer to watch Werner Herzog's remake, I recognize the excellence of this very old movie. It's one of the greatest achievements of silent cinema and is a must for any student of the horror genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Nosferatu" is one of those rare non-comedy silent films that actually improves with time. This flickering keepsake of a long-dead past, shot in oddly-tinted black-and-white with mouths that move but which we can not hear, casts an almost sepulchral aura of peaking into a grave. We come to this film expecting fear, but what "Nosferatu" delivers is dread.The first of many films based on Bram Stoker's "Dracula" (though its failure to do so officially nearly led to its being throttled in its crib by Stoker's widow), "Nosferatu" is the story of Hutter, an ambitious realtor who gets more than he bargained for when he sells a house overlooking his own home to Count Orlok (Max Schreck). Orlok, you see, is really Nosferatu, a vampyre (that's the way it's spelled in the titles), and Nosferatu has taken an unholy interest in Hutter's wife, Ellen (Greta Schrder).As Orlok famously observes: "Is that your wife? What a lovely throat."It's a famous line, but deceptive, too. There's not much humor in "Nosferatu", even of the dark kind. Schreck is so full of dark menace and rat-like ugliness that it defies belief he can move around the streets of a large German town without being noticed. But Schreck is also one of the most convincing monsters ever put on screen, no thanks to CGI or even much makeup beyond some putty around the ears and kohl around the eyes. He's more zombie than vampire, his eyes seemingly dead as he makes his grand entrance into Hutter's bedroom, memorably backlit as Hutter cowers helplessly under the sheets. Just try and get that image out of your head once you've seen it!Director F.W. Murnau launches the horror film genre in fine style, with special effects that still cast a spell long after technology has moved on. Maybe it helps we don't expect in 1922 to see tricks involving double exposure and stop-motion photography seamlessly integrated into a storyline.Murnau ditches some elements of the Dracula story, reducing the character of Van Helsing into a barely-there character Bulwar, "a Paracelsian", which connotes some mysticism "Nosferatu" never quite delves into. There's also Knock, Hutter's boss, who has the Renfield role, driven crazy either from proximity to Nosferatu (though the two never meet) or just from wearing his pants up to his armpits.The performance of Alexander Granach as Knock, and Gustav von Wangenheim as Hutter, are very broad by today's standards. It's a 90-minute movie, but one that could have stood another 20 minutes of cuts. In addition to the padding involving Bulwar, we have some strange logic gaps, like when the crewmen of a ship open one of the boxes they have been charged to transport by Nosferatu, discover nothing inside it but dirt and rats, and then take on the rest of the cargo anyway. Surely that was not what the manifest said the boxes contained. So why transport it at all?But of course "Nosferatu" is really not meant to work on that level. It's a film about the inexplicable, like how Knock cries "Blut ist Leben!" and Ellen wanting Nosferatu's rat claws around her young body, melting in desire when she sees the ugly count staring at her from the window opposite her bedroom. This works in "Dracula" because Bela Lugosi had charm, but Max Schreck?What seems to draw morbid Ellen is the lure of the grave, the most powerful common element in "Nosferatu", more so now than ever as the actual making of the film passes from living memory.</fullReview>

Alas, Mr. Schreck isn't shown doing many vampire deeds; mainly, he just looks menacing - and ugly. The horror herein is much more suggested than visible on screen, save for the film's rather more pointed ending.

		<shortDescription>Some Better Ideas Than Dracula</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nosferatu is one of our earliest films and certainly one of our most entertaining of earliest films. The film is shown in virtually every film history class throughout universities around the globe. It has been picked apart from every angle of meaning from that of pure expressionism to political nuance. The film did not win any awards after all the Oscars were still 5 more years away from creation. The film is German and actually titled Nosferatu, Eine Symphonie des Grauens which translates to Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror. The film was instantly paired down to just Nosferatu. Directed by F.W. Murnau and staring Max Schreck as the vampire, the film was shot in 1921 and released in 1922. The story is an adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula but the names and details were changed in the movie because the studio was unable to buy the rights to the novel. Items like "vampire" became "Nosferatu" and "Count Dracula" became "Count Orlok."We're lucky to have this film at all. Nosferatu was the first and only production of Prana Film company which was founded in 1921 by Enrico Dieckmann and Albin Grau. Albin Grau was an artist and specialized in the occult. Due to lawsuits by the Stoker estate the film company had to declare bankruptcy and evades the lawsuits altogether. Grau had the idea to shoot a vampire film during his wartime experiences. During the winter in 1916 a Serbian farmer told Grau that his father was a vampire and an Undead. Of course this gave Grau several ideas for movies. On Nosferatu he was not only the producer but he was also the production designer and responsible for how the entire film and characters look.Henrik Galeen was sought after and wrote the screenplay for the film. He was especially experienced in dark romanticism and had worked on other screenplays. He set the story in a fictional North German harbor town named Wisborg. It was also his idea for the vampire to bring a plague to Wisborg when rats follow Nosferatu off the ship from which he lands in the harbor. It was his decision to leave out the character of Van Helsing, the vampire hunter.The film is very engaging for 1922. The establishment of the alternate vampire that came to be known as "Dracula-type" this more rat-like depiction is very believable. This adaptation of Dracula is as positively hailed as the original Dracula itself. The movie is in public domain and because of that most of the copies of this film are of poor quality though it is easy to find the film. There are some very nice quality of film in release and it is well worth it to view one that is high quality so as not to miss any of the fine details of the film.The film was remade in 1979 by German director Werner Herzog. Like all remakes that film is a film unto itself and should not necessarily be compared though it is also worth time to be viewed. Nosferatu is a part of film history but aside from what grade history may give, the film is scary and well made. It is a wonderful film and Max Schreck as Count Orlok is terrific to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expressionism in Nosferatu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Each generation has a different Dracula. When F. W. Murnau directed Henrik Galeen's adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, Nosferatu, a Symphony of Horror in 1922, he created a Dracula for the German expressionist community. Through both acting and editing, the director used the camera to focus on particular emotions that both actors and audiences were feeling.Throughout the film, the camera remains stationary. This mise-en-sc?ne only allowed the audience in on what Murnau wants the audience to see and feel. Emotional moments in which the vampire is about to attack Jonathon in his sleep are inter-laced with that of Nina waking from a dream to warn him of the attack. Nothing else in the two rooms can be seen, forcing the audience to focus their attention on the action taking place before the camera. This drawn-out suspense is felt by both audience and characters.Another editing example that evoked emotion involved Jonathon observing Nosferatu's late-night preparations for his journey to England. Jonathon watched Nosferatu from his bedroom window as the vampire loaded what looks like coffins onto the back of a horse-drawn carriage. Murnau slowed down the filming process to make the vampire appear as if he was moving faster than humanly possible. Cuts between Jonathon's horrified but curious face are inter-laced with the activity outside his bedroom window. Finally, the vampire is seen climbing into the final coffin and closing the lid. The horse-drawn carriage leaves the castle grounds and Jonathon is on his own to escape. Also, "special effects" add to the fantasy that is Dracula through the technology of editing. In one scene, the vampire appears out of thin air before a terrified Jonathon. Also in the death scene of the monster, the director created the illusion that the sunlight radiating from a window evaporated him into nothing but a puff of smoke on the floor. What is interesting in that shot is the director's ability to make the vampire slowly dissolves, starting with his fingers and ending with the smoke. An example of an actor's wardrobe and make-up giving off a strong emotion is seen in the horrifying appearance of Nosferatu himself. Count Orlok appears almost rat-like. His elongated nose and sharp, pointy teeth give his face the impression of a rodent. Murnau used Nosferatu's long, skinny fingers to cast shadows upon the walls in order to "creep" out the audience and give an impression of a crawling monster waiting in the shadows. Multiple shots found in the film give the impression of a slithery movement whenever Nosferatu moves about the screen. His arms are stationary at his side and his fingers spread out, as if ready to attack. This induced a fear in both characters and audience. This fear is only intensified when appearance meets movement, creating an understanding that the monster is not natural. Nosferatu's appearance makes it very clear that he is the monster of the film and is to be feared. Later vampires that would come across American screens would take the fantasy vampire in a real world in Nosferatu, and create a life-like human vampire in a fantasy world. The vampires would become sexier and more desirable to our American fantasies and less bazaar. In German expressionism, the audience feared the monster for how unhuman-like he appeared. In American films, the actions of the vampire first makes the audience desire the vampire, making fear a secondary emotion.Strong emotions can also be communicated through the exaggerated acting of the characters. One character in particular is that of Renfield. Renfield, who could be considered Nosferatu's devoted servant, is locked in an asylum. He senses his master's return and becomes unruly. The actor must exhibit skills that would lead the audience to understand his lunacy without the use of dialogue cards. His uniform was shabby and his hair was unkept, which would be considered consistent with a lunatic's inability to care for himself. Also, Renfield is eating flies when the doctor enters the room. His wide eyes dart around the room in an insane manner. His "desire" for blood even leads him to attack the doctor. His wild-beast-like movements (jumping from the floor onto the bed, crouching on the bed as if ready to attack anyone who comes near) only lead to a greater understanding of the character's insanity.This film was the first known adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula. Even though small elements are different in the movie (the death of Dracula) and some are all together missing (no wolves who are friends of the vampire, the death of Lucy, and the three vampire women) the over-all emotional portrayal of the story is present. The appearance of the character of Nosferatu greatly resembles that of the vampire in the book. The movie's vampire would differ from our American culture some years later when American idealism would saturate the movie industry. Our vampires would become more beautiful and sophisticated. But that is our generation seeing the story through our idealism.Overall, this movie is a good example of expressionism in Germany. It is worth the time to watch this film. This film is a great short summary of Stoker's book Dracula for those who want a "condensed" version of the classic ? or those who just like classic silent films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An admiring reading;the outcasts' drives and secrets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We may say in what sense _vampirism tales are symbolic, allegorical, metaphors?vampires ,like addicts, let people state loudly the character of urgency of certain needs. Even if not explicitly related to sex or other vigorous needs, _vampirism serves as a vehicle for expressing the urgency of these direct needs. Ordinary people, average undistinguished people rather often feel a desire and push as strong as that felt by the vampire or the addict?the outcasts of the normal society. I agree that in many cases _vampirism is a pretext for giving shape to inner needs and impulses. The vampire, the addict need to feed?they need it urgently; this allows people to talk about needs other than the professed ones?more directly, secret needs.Being an implacable foe of _allegorizing in either film or literary criticism, I am myself amazed that I came to speak about the allegoric ,symbolic, hidden, metaphoric content of Dracula's tale. In NOSFERATU this content is expressed better and more powerful than in perhaps any other rendition of the tale; it might be the single adaptation also that makes the book interesting. Al the other Dracula films that I know are more or less exploitation crap.It is understood that I do not mean _vampirism/ addiction as a metaphor for venereal/ infectious diseases, etc., but as an image of secret urges and needs, of a nature either organic or moral. Vampirism and sexuality are obviously mirrored; the same goes for yet another private sides.And yet I am not saying that _vampirism is a mask, a subterfuge, a means to an end. I only explained why a well made vampires story, like NOSFERATU, impresses so powerfully. At least some of its power comes from this. We are at least shown on screen the force of the drives, of the needs. This does not explain all; it explains something. We are shown how urgent is the need?of the vampire, of the addict; we are unaccustomed with such things on screen. It takes its material from the inner hidden experience; therefore, it is effective. But of course the majority of the horror directors lack this flair.Besides,NOSFERATU reopened my taste for the great literary ancestors (Stoker's, Miss Shelley's stuff ...).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First Classic of Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nosferatu by F.W. Murnau, can be considered as being the first classic of cinema history. It dates back to 1922, the early history of the seventh art. If it wasn't for some serious research in order to obtain a full copy of this movie, then I would have to give this title to another film.It is true, this is the first silent black &amp; white movie I have seen, but it was certainly a good starting point, and also a place I could recommend others to start from. Its story is simple; it is basically a summary of Bram Stoker's Dracula, the backbone of the story. It eliminates secondary characters or diminishing their roles in order to present the movie with few interventions of inter-titles.It is very fast moving, understandable and even though it dates back more than 80 years, it is still scary. This is mainly due to some great shots by F.W. Murnau and the amazing main character portrayed by Max Schreck. Some of these effects are yellow tinting for day, blue tinting for night, an amazing sound score and the genius negative shot.Max Schreck portrays Nosferatu. Murnau considered him quite ugly and just ordered ear and nose tips to be added to his make-up. Schreck does not blink on the whole movie, wears heavy clothes and always creates an aura of darkness and mystery whenever he is on screen. This can be finally seen on one of the final scene where the shadow of the vampire is seen walking up the stairs.All these and more, make of this film a great visual experience. This is probably the most significant release on the dark world of vampires since the before mentioned Bram Stoker's Dracula.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>F.W. Murnau's Dracula is just about the most horrifying creature you could experience. Max Schreck presents himself a a thin zombie-like creature with a long face and long bony hands; nothing like the Draculas that many are familiar with, dressed as if they are going to the opera. This is a chilling Dracula; one that would strike fear into anyone that laid eyes upon it. His castle is also different in that it is a crumbling structure along a rocky weedy path, not the lush forests we have come to expect.Murnau uses his settings, shadow and lighting to great effect to present a chilling tale or horror. His characters show real emotions, especially the naive Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim) and his lovely wife Ellen (Greta Schrder).The rats throughout were most appropriate as Schrenk also looked like a rat and this film was made at the time of the Black Death in Germany.The ending is very Christian with a sacrifice for all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Edition Is Ultimate!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few years ago when Fox issued Murnua's "Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans" on DVD as a promotion for their "Studio Classic" series, I was thrilled to see and hear the results of their efforts -- the film had never looked better. As for Murnau's earlier masterpiece, "Nosferatu", it has certainly been released in any number of DVD versions -- some of them quite nice. As this films was originally found to be in copyright violation (the filmmakers not having bothered to get the book rights from Braum Stoker's wife) and the court order to destroy the original and all copies, one was grateful that the film somehow had survived and was available in decent form to see at all. Now comes Kino's Ultimate Edition with a high definition transfer made from the finest surviving archival material from around the world. Who would have ever guessed that this film could be seen in such a breathtaking form! I've viewed the film many, many times -- but seeing this Ultimate Edition I felt like I was seeing it the way it would have been seen back in 1922. The inclusion of Hans Erdmann's original score, newly recorded, is a big plus also. If this is a film that you care about then don't hesitate to upgrade to this 2007 release -- it truly is breathtaking!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Nosferatu" A glimpse of our first theatrical Vampire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Nosferatu" is a wonderful film that was made in 1922. The director of the film was F.W. Murnau, who based his film loosely on the novel "Dracula" written by Bram Stoker. The film later came into legal problems with the movie rights or licensing because the film was based on the book without authorization. Even with certain names being changed like Count Dracula to Count Orlock, you can still get a sense of who they are referencing to from the book within the movie. The same goes for the other characters that are portrayed in the film. Max Shreck who plays Count Dracula in the film "Nosferatu" leaves you with an incredible image of what might a real vampire might look like. Since I have never seen the movie until now, I was mesmerized by the detail that went into the character of Count Dracula. Details such as pointy ears, long fingers and fingernails, and never blinking within the movie made this film unique in the 1920's film era. Having read the book "Dracula" by Bram Stoker you see where Murnau got his ideas on his movie from the book. The film doesn't go by the book quite exactly which helps shed new light on how Murnau's version of the story is for him. Certain shots throughout the film were fascinating. Shots that I noticed that were quite interesting to me were how they made Count Dracula fade in and out of certain shots within the film. It was an incredible special effect that I have never seen done on a black and white film made in the 1920's. Furthermore, to see on the shots taken where Jonathan Harker is picked up by the phantoms is baffling. The scene depicts the horse carriage moving extremely fast, while everything else is moving in normal time. I also thought the shot taken on the boat where Count Dracula arises from his coffin straight as a board was an impressive take. You do not see any strings or wires to help him make such a move, so it leaves you to wonder how they thought of doing that without making it noticeable on film. One other shot that was impressive in my opinion was the scene where Count Dracula is walking up the stairs in the mansion that the Harker's live in. It is interesting the way you see his shadow ascends up the stairs on the wall and the shadows of his arms stretch along the wall into the room and onto Mina. All of these were incredible effects done in this film, which makes you wonder how they shot them in the year that they made this film. I noticed that through out this film Murnau shot a lot of shots at eye level form. I would say that eighty percent of this movie is shot at eye level. He did use some low angle shots though, like when they are shooting Renfield on top of the roof of the building trying to get away from the police that are trying to put him back in the asylum. He even used high angle shots within the film that I noticed only twice. Once when Harker is at Dracula's castle looking down through a window watching these men load piles of earth into these coffins, and even see's Dracula himself get into one of the coffins. It is also another time within the film that is depicted by fast movement of people doing actions in this fast pace motion. Another time he uses a high angle shot is when he shoots the scene where Harker see the town people caring coffins of their loved ones down the street that have died from this plaque that they have thought has infected their town. The film was well shot though, especially beginning and ending every shot with the picture looking through a peep hole getting smaller to bigger or bigger to smaller. One thing in the film that I thought was kind of a problem was that since it is filmed in black and white you could not really tell if it was night time. Because the filmmakers shot everything in the day, it was difficult to depict day time scenes from night time scenes. In some scenes you see Dracula walking around outside when it looks like it is daytime with the sun up, but you know that it could not be possible due to the fact that if it was so Dracula would be dead. So in that sense you just had to know that it was night time all the times you see Dracula within the film until the end. I also found the music to be quite odd in this movie. Some parts of the film had wonderful music to go along with the story, but then there were other parts that seemed different from what I have ever seen done in a silent film. I noticed that Murnau was trying to go for something out of the norm, and more into something that was unique and different with the music and sounds that were put into this film. Overall the movie was an amazing film made for its time. It was extremely thought out with great detail and cinematography. I was incredible impressed with how the film was put together to do such special effects for its time. For anyone who likes old movies and the story of Dracula, "Nosferatu" is a must see film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece of silent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nosferatu is the first of many Dracula/vampire films. It basically follows the plot of Bram Stoker's Dracula novel (even more so than the 1931 film), but winds down to an original ending during the last half hour. It revolves around the ploy of the vampire Count Orlok, who buys real estate in Germany and takes interest in the neighbor's wife.The cinematography is very well done. The shadows and angles in every scene are well-placed. The segments where Orlok's shadow is shown pacing along a wall are effective and suspenseful. Orlok himself is brilliantly designed, possibly being one of the best monsters in film history. The make-up and costume work done on Max Schreck is phenomenal for the time. Schreck's acting style is fitting as well.The plot is a little bit jumbled up, but flows smoothly nonetheless. It felt like too much of the content was unrelated to Orlok. The scenes about carnivorous plants were excellent, but some other scenes did not have much value. Also, it felt like there were too many plot lines, which lead to a few plot holes. I would rather have them traded for more screen time on Orlok.Overall, the film is excellent for its age. It has problems that come about from being a silent film, but is compelling to watch. If your a fan of silent films, this one is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant Reconstruction - Nosferatu 2007 edition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally! The release of the newly restored 2007 edition of Nosferatu, is one I have been waiting for with great anticipation, ever since I heard it was being restored and I can safely say, it was well worth the wait. Indeed, it is an absolute masterpiece, shown as it should be! Its a definitive must have, for anyone who is interested in silent film. I own the beautiful steelbook German edition from Transit (as i live in Berlin) but please note, it is entirely w/o English subtitles! The film itself looks utterly incredible in fact, we have never seen it looking so good.The picture is crystal clear, sharp and very detailed, its practically flawless. Its a joy to watch. The original colour tinting, brings the chapters alive. All previous releases literally pale in comparison. I already own the soundtrack score from a 1995 RCA/BMG cd, but combined with the moving images and 5.1 audio, Nosferatu now looks and sounds terrific. Although I must say I really enjoyed the excellent James Bernard score for the BFI release, this is the way it was intended to be heard back in the 1920s. Therefore, I highly recommend this splendid DVD and by buying it you support the hard work that went into its reconstruction and invest in future releases to come. Congratulations to Transit on their excellent work in restoring this and other classics, such as Battleship Potemkin, Metropolis or Der Golem et al. Well done!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murnau's first great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The German unauthorized version of Dracula which we are lucky to still have today. All copies were ordered destroyed, but there were enough distributed that some remained around. It is a terrific film with a great performance by Max Schreck as Count Orlok. The part of this movie that stays in you brain are the visual images. Count Orlok coming out of the coffin in the ship, Ellen Hutter on the beach with the cemetery crosses behind her, and the precession of coffins of the street. This film has the best ending of any of the Dracula films. It is much more poetic than finding Dracula and driving a stake through his hart. This is my second favorite Murnau movie behind Faust. It is a must see film. The images are powerful and Schreck's performance is great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cinascape of Unforgettable Imagery.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So much has been said and written about Murnau's classic that I had to watch the film a second time to escape all the expectations, preconceived ideas, and the natural human tendency to compare endlessly (especially when critics build a film up with the title "greatest _____"). That and Nosferatu was my first exposure to silent films, and that's jumping into a whole different world of cinema unprepared to fully appreciate the abstract and dreamlike quality of any silent film. Upon the second viewing, I could accept Nosferatu on its own terms.But even from that first viewing, late at night watching Turner Classic Movies, the Symphony of Horror succeeded in burning several images into my memory so that upon my numerous revisits to the film I felt a sense of anxiety as those scenes approached. Most notably: the scenes involving Nosferatu, himself.The first glimpse of a stalking Orlock, standing motionless against the darkness - his white face clearly visible, talon-like fingers and claws extended, and as Hutter takes cover within his chambers we watch the vampire emerge from the darkness and enter through the pointed-arc doorway that opens by Nosferatu's will.And my personal favorite: later upon the plague-strickened ship, the first mate goes down below deck to deal with the mysterious cargo and Orlok rises out of his coffin in such a way that defies physics, stiffly and without using a muscle, he swings up like a hinged hatch. The first mate runs for his life, and takes his chances with the sea leaving the poor captain to fall prey to the stalking vampire.Even in the calmer moments, I watched Max Schreck performance in silent awe at how, metaphorically speaking, Nosferatu has a clear voice of his own despite the literal absence of sound ? how the movements and makeup define the character so vividly. Going over the deeds and legal documents, Nosferatu stares wide-eyed at all the papers placed before him. Hutter drops a pendant with a photograph of his wife, and the vampire picks it up, studying it with even more intensity. Then glancing up to Hutter, a curiously reserved look with conspiring, suspicious, and sinister overtones lingers on his face. Suppressing his excitement as though he's waited centuries for this plan to unfold, as though he's waited centuries to find Ellen, but he doesn't wish any soul to know. It gives more power to the remark, "Your wife has a beautiful neck" and a twinge of dread as he ominously adds, "I accept the beautiful abandoned house across from yours." My second viewing opened the door for consciously observing even more imagery within the film, including the negative shot of the coach as it rides up to the castle and the low shot of the stalking vampire with the ship's riggings and ropes backdropping him.I loved the haunting and beautiful interaction between Ellen and Nosferatu as the vampire (half a continent away), closes in on Hutter. She awakens from a dream and cries out with her arms reaching out, and Murnau cuts to Orlok turning as though he'd heard her voice across that great distance. Murnau cuts back to Ellen, their eyelines matching up, and the Vampire calls off his attack as though something had transpired between himself and Hutter's wife. Through frame composition and editing, Murnau created this sensation of a supernatural communication.On the second viewing, I also really noticed Ellen's eyes and the lingering sadness she carries throughout the entire film (although the film never explicitly explores it). Those are the eyes of a woman carrying suppressed emotions (conscious or not) that burdens her soul, and yet she either refuses (or society forbids) such explicit expression. Watch her curious reactions to Hutter delivering flowers, to the letter she receives from Hutter, and to her lover's return ? she seems strangely distant with a reluctance to show intimacy.But watch also the expression on her face as her outburst interferes with Nosferatu's attack on Hutter, and as she reads of the book of vampire lore, and notice how those repressed emotions come closer to the surface as though somewhere on the lower levels of her subconsciously she's always known her role and ultimate fate in this story.Anyway, I'm not here to add to the long list of people who throw around the "greatest silent horror film" phrase. For one, I don't have enough exposure to silent films to make that assessment, and for two I think it ultimately cultivates the wrong approach. People shouldn't sit down with Nosferatu expecting the ultimate horror film that will scare them senselessly. That's not the film they'll find.Nosferatu is far too old, far too primitive, and has been blatantly ripped off far too many times to still scare the modern audience. A bad horror movie that does not make, however. Despite its age, Nosferatu sports some fascinating and memorable visuals (that remain strangely original even today), and an even more fascinating history.But, let's be honest and fair, will any horror film you've seen recently still be considered scary in 80 years? The fact Nosferatu's images still possess the power they do is a testament to its craftsmanship. And that is the reason to see Nosferatu.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early Horror Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1922's Nosferatu is one of the early classics of horror cinema. Directed by the great German director F.W. Murnau, this film uses lighting and lack of sound to its distinct advantage. I've read that the Bram Stoker estate nearly succeeded in having all of the prints of this film destroyed. All fans of classic cinema should be grateful that this did not happen.What interests me about silent era films is that they are so old now, one gets a sense when viewing them of looking back into the past through the lens of a fiction film. Nosferatu is the standard Dracula story and reminds much of 1932's Vampyre in style and tone. I'm not going to critique the story too much as most readers already know it, but would like to offer comments concerning this version.Max Shreck as the vampire distinguishes this film from the countless other Dracula and vampire films that have been produced through the years, for in most the vampire is normally portrayed as handsome and debonair, a creature that one almost wishes will wind up in the heroine's bedroom. But, Max Shreck is garishly tall, long-fingered and bald in the ugliest way, looking more like an over-sized gnome than the elegant Dracula we are familiar with. One has to watch closely as Shreck becomes progressively uglier as the film progresses, a very subtle suggestion to the viewer of the deterioration of his life and psyche. Murnau uses rats throughout the film to tie them to the presence of the disturbing vampire. The scene on the boat where he emerges from the ships' hold is perhaps the most frightening in screen history. Nothing has topped it in the 84 years since it was filmed. Credit Murnau for this.Much of Nosferatu was filmed on location in villages and old buildings, again reminiscent of Vampyre. In the use of lighting and camera angles, one gets the idea that Murnau and Carl Dreyer were cinematic soul mates. I have always maintained that some films are better made in black and white, and after viewing Nosferatu again before preparing this review, I am also convinced that some films, even today, would benefit from limited dialog and, in some cases, total silence. One wonders what Nosferatu would have been had it been a talkie? Perhaps still a classic, but the images of Shreck as Nosferatu benefit from the mind having no external stimulation such as background music or dialog. 1979's Nosferatu with Klaus Kinski, while not a bad film, simply does not give us an insight into what Murnau would have done with sound technology for this masterpiece.One thing is a bit different in this version than in others. The story goes that, to destroy the vampire and the effects he has had on his victims, he must be in the company of a female virgin early in the morning when the cock crows. I don't want to offer a spoiler, here, but pay careful attention to Nosferatu's ending. It is a brilliant piece of camera work and is a wonderful ending to a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best vampire-horror ever! Still!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing a a fair amount of vampire type movies and other attempts at supernatural horror this is still the best ever! I have seen it 5 times by now which is a lot for me for a movie and a silent one at that! I am mad about the way this movie portrays the vampire as nothing other than an animal. No melodramatic human drama here. It is very effective in this way. The photography is great and one cannot help but be pulled into the story. I saw versions with different background music but one with Bach organ was the best. I will certainly freely recommend this movie to any lover of classic movies and rate it up there with 'Metropolis' and 'M'(Both by Fritz Lang). Enjoy late at night with a bottle of well matured Pinotage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A prophetic symbol of the rise of Hitler or just a good vampire movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nosferatu would probably be almost entirely forgotten today if it weren't for the memorable images of the rat-like Count Orlok. Max Schreck's performance, and the way director H W Murnau uses it, create a screen monster whose appearance is uniquely disgusting, but who at the same time seems perfectly natural. Like the young, eager estate agent, Thomas Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim) who journeys from Germany to sell him a property, we accept him on his own terms, while knowing in our minds that he is to be feared. Orlak's naturalness is all the more remarkable by contrast with the other characters who we never forget are acting, because of silent cinema's exaggerated facial expressions and movements.Somebody has commented on IMDb that the film is a portrait of a failed marriage between vain, greedy, uncaring Thomas, and self-abegnating Ellen (Greta Schrder) who has nothing to lose in sacrificing herself to destroy Orlok. Certainly, the couple are ill-suited, but I see Thomas as uncertain, trying to prove himself to an aloof, brooding Ellen. Is she perhaps the ultimate femme fatale, a destroyer who will rise again in Orlok's place to continue spreading plague? The rats, soil and coffins bring to mind the horrors of the WWI trenches. In 1921, just about when the film was made, Hitler - fascinating to women both personally and nationally - became leader of the Nazi party, and the plague of war would soon return.The film is usually regarded as being expressionist, and the most vivid images, such as the shadows of Orlok's hands, fall into that category. But much of the outside photography of Hutter travelling through the mountains, of Orlok's castle, and of Ellen by the sea, are nearer to 18th century German romanticism. The Eureka DVD on which I base these comments contains interesting commentaries on the movie's locations (most of which still exist) and its artistic context. This Australian-produced 2-disc DVD, with sepia and b&amp;w versions of the film, has very expressive background music by Art Zoyd; though I preferred to watch in silence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like most great horror films, it's not the story that stays with you, it's the images. Moments that last only a few seconds, but are in your thoughts long after the film is over. "Nosferatu" is filled with moments like these, despite having a running time of a little over an hour (at least the version I saw was). What makes "Nosferatu" a more compelling experience is the fact that there is no sound, other than the music. The best way to watch the film is by yourself and without breaks. Today, the story seems dull and full of clichs, but the images are strikingly original and captivating. One must admire the use of lighting and set direction in cruical parts of the film. It's not to say that the movie is without mistakes, but not enough to make the experience one to remember. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Experimental special FX, mysterious actors and great cinematography -&gt; a tense piece of art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected much from this film ('The bringer of the plague'), as it is supposed to be an early (the first?) Dracula movie and because it is mostly named in one breath after 'Das Kabinett des Doktor Caligari' (1920, Robert Wiene). I was not disappointed by the created atmosphere in this film and by the (not yet very convincing, but) scary special FX like stop-frame animation and the like. The story is also ingenious and entertaining. I'm glad I saw this first and 'Shadow of the Vampire' (2000, Merhige) not long after it, in a theater. You'll probably want to see this one twice also and then 'Shadow of the vampire' right after as it is complementary (not opposite) to this one and definitely worth it. Nosferatu is a world of its own and has little to do with other Dracula films. To me Nosferatu is the first and last great Dracula film.If 'M' (1931, Fritz Lang) interests you visually, go see this one and 'Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse' (1933, Fritz Lang) as they are both shot by cinematographer Fritz Arno Wagner. He must be at least very intrigued by expressionism, if not, BE one of the pioneering expressionists in cinema. See for yourself.10 points out of 10 :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an astounding, remarkable film this is ... how can a film that is made in 1922, and so totally devoid of speech still manages to touch my marrowbones to its core is just beyond me. Nosferatu is a sheer masterpiece in film techniques, as well as a brilliant exercise in the very essence of vampirism down to its simplest manifestation. Every scenes in this film is literally filled with images that seems to really understand its main subject, and the actor Max Schreck gave an unequalled performance that brought this film to a whole new height. Considering that its made in 1922, some of the scenes are simply breathtaking ... like when I see the Count revealing his true nature for the first time, as well as the coffin scene where he rises up stiffly .... you can't put a price on that.After seeing this, just about every classic "Dracula" movies that I've seen becomes overtly comical and obsolete. Who wants to see some vampire that wears a halloween cape and a butler's suit? Not me, after seeing a film that is not just about a vampire sucking people's blood, but the very idea of vampirism itself. Honestly, those who don't like Nosferatu can't really call themselves true fans of vampire films. Watch this film, and discover the hidden magic behind this amazing silent masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Dracula</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nosferatu is the best version of Dracula around. Some nine years before Lugosi and about 5 years before sound was used in film Murnau created a surrealistic nightmare and I'm still not sure how he did it. Take a look at the ship board sequences. These were filmed with a bulkly crank action camera and the scenes were shot totally on location. A great feat for the early 1920s. And who can forget the demonic image of Max Schreck at Graf Orlock. He is the stuff that some of my wildest nightmares have been. I'll admit that his acting may leave a little to be desired but I can guarantee that if I ran into him in a dark alley one night it sure would scare the hell out of me. And has anybody noticed that Ellen (the Mina character) is the one who figures out what is going on and kills the vampire-granted at the cost of her own life? Did the Germans realize that they were making a feminist statement? Nah, probably not. It just worked out that way. Nosferatu is a symphony of shudders, terror, and images. A 10 out of 10 for me. A must for any horror movie fan.</fullReview>

The film creates an atmosphere of dread and disorientation towards the end by using symbols and motifs of death . Max Shreck is truly repugnant and well, a little scary, as Orlok. Directed by F.W Murnau ,it's an unauthorized adaption of Dracula.The flaws: It's dated somewhat by the overacting of everybody, the disappearance after a careful setup of a potential Van Helsing character ,and various other stiff, flimsy bits occasionally.

		<shortDescription>The Most Entertaining German Impressionist Film for our Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" remains the hallmark of the genre, "Nosferatu", by F.W. Murnau holds sway as the most immediately accessible and entertaining of these films from the early half of the century that so influenced filmmaking, and a wonderful example of the genre in its own right.In the film, a young impressionable working-class man named Hutter, played in an almost infantilely ignorant manner, goes on an assignment to sell a piece of abandoned property across from his home to one Count Orlock in Transylvania. Of course this dark figure turns out to be a vampire, who easily overtakes the young man and heads back to his home in Weisborg to take possession of his new property, bring death and destruction with him.An obvious thievery of the Dracula story by Bram Stoker, Mrs. Stoker sued to have all copies of this film destroyed. Luckily, it survived and it is now agreed to be one of the major origins of modern horror films. But in a deeper analysis (which the German Impressionists were trying to convey in their art) one sees the sexual triangle between the young man (Hutter), his wife, and the Nosferatu, driven by the struggle between civilized and bestial impulses. One can also view all of the characters and their stories as a microcosm for a single human mind, a characteristic seen often in this genre.Beyond the psychology and art though, this is an old silent horror film that can still give me the jitters if I sit and watch it alone at night.--GD</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful but funny film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me first say that I like to watch horror and silent films. I had seen many "Dracula" movies before this one, but I didn't expect that "Nosferatu" was turn out being so unscary, and beautiful!However, the film has many flaws. First, it is much too long (80 minutes of slow pacing when it could have been much faster?). The film is set up much differently than the other versions, the final scenes in Bremen are short and run together, and are a disappointment. Next, "Nosferatu" was shot by day, and it is painfully obvious that most of the "night" scenes were shot in broad daylight.On a more interesting note, there is not much screen time for Dr. Van Helsing, Lucy, and Westenra. They are much less important. It is all right this way, but can be hard to accept at first.However, the use of classical music in the soundtrack is very effective for the most part (except at the end), making it more classical than scary. The look of the film is also marvelous. Dracula's castle is not as scary as in later versions, but it still gives a faint sense of menace.As all Dracula's go, this will not scare you. It is too beautiful to be suspenseful. Max Shreck as Dracula has a bald head and bat-wing ears. His appearance is unsettling, even funny, and was surely scary for 1922. But it is the least scary horror film I have ever seen, and when compared to other silent films and early '30s talkies (ex. "The Cat and the Canary", "White Zombie", the 1931 "Dracula") it is completely unscary. "Nosferatu" is proof that a horror film can be beautiful and more of a classic than a horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although not 'horror' by today's bloody, gory standards, Nosferatu is a psychic thrill. Max Schreck is the ideal vampire. His pure ugliness makes him, versus today's sleekness and attractiveness of vampires. Modern vampires have an allure to them, a strange attractiveness. This vampire has absolutely nothing attractive about him. Whereas vampires now represent more of a dog-like being, Nosferatu presents Max Schreck as a rodent, a rat. The 'fangs' are placed in the front of the mouth, not concealed by the lips, just as a rat. Commonly seen vampires have two enlarged canines for fangs, making them rather dog-like. Nosferatu is just what a vampire should be; horrifying. He is not attractive in any way, and just his appearance makes you want to avoid him. Also take note that modern vampires only have an affect on their victims. Nosferatu, when in his new home, brings horrible plague. Insanity takes over in what once was a beautiful land filled with happy people. Depression strikes, famine takes over, and this does not just occur to those who have been bitten by the vampire. Rather than moving just one at a time, from person to person, he affects the whole city. This is what makes Nosferatu amazing. Heaven forbid one will just have to look beyond the surface, and realize how horrible this person really is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though this film was made in 1922, it still excels over all of the vampire flicks to date! The cinematography was absolutely terrifying and brilliant! Nosferatu is the only Vampire I have seen who is astonishingly creepy! The film quality may be very grainy and aged, but it only makes the movie even more mystifying. And the organ music makes the movie even more macabre. I just bought the re-issue of Nosferatu, and instead of the organ music shivering your spine, the music is done by none other than Type O Negative! It may not be the same as the classic organ music, but Type O is a very gothic and Vampiric band. I personally think it adds a lot of emotion to it, and it fits the movie like a glove. That was a great idea to re-release a classic bone chiller from 1922, and add a gothic 90's twist to it. And if you're not a fan of Type O Negative, you can still see it with the original music. So check it out, I guarantee you'll love it, Danimal never lies...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nosferatu was made in 1922, and if there's been a better vampire movie in the last 77 years, I haven't seen it. Don't be put off by the fact that it's silent. If anything, that only adds to the creepy atmosphere (hearing Dracula speak would have made him less scarey). The image of Max Schreck, as Count Dracula, rising from his coffin or climbing out of the hold of his death ship, is still sensational. Even his shadow is terrifying, as brilliantly used by director Murnau. The scene of his demise is haunting. Some of the narrative scenes between Dracula appearances are a bit melodramatic, but they don't detract enough to keep this from being the classic vampire movie. Horror buffs, you can keep your special effects. Believe me, if you haven't seen Max Schreck as Dracula, you ain't seen nothing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Defined the horror genre. Period.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is easy to see a film such as Nosferatu and discard it out of hand as being dated. What makes Nosferatu such an important film is that it was released in 1922. It was the first, and arguably the best, screen adaptation of Bram Stoker's gothic classic, "Dracula". F. W. Murnau's use of expressionistic makeup, lighting, and shadows would later manifest themselves in countless horror films of later decades. The conventions for screen horror were developed in Nosferatu and are still common (albeit in a modified form) in contemporary horror movies.The only thing that bothered me about Nosferatu was the overstated acting. This acting style is typical of silent film, and I do not discredit Nosferatu on account of this.</fullReview>

But not long before that, he's out in broad daylight, walking around with his casket under his arm!3. Last, but absolutely not least, there is the geographic issue. It takes place in Brehmen, right? That is in Germany. And Ellen is waiting for her love Jonathan, who is traveling by boat, she's sitting on a beach looking out.

While there is a truly moving love story behind the scenes, the evil nature of the creature was always meant to terrify each and every being to consider his existance. Not only does "Nosferatu" scare the wits out of you, but it does so without words. For an actor to reach into your soul and drain your conception of reality with nothing more than movement and expression is a feat that no cinematic production of our modern era could hope to achieve. This is my favorite movie, without question or hesitation. If you've never given the silent cinema a chance, this is where you should start.</fullReview>

This movie had excellent effects for a 79 year old movie.

		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to see this beautiful movie on the big screen, in a gorgeous print, accompanied by the Oregon Symphony a few days before Halloween. It was a terrific experience, save for the lack of sophistication shown by the rest of the audience. They laughed -- LOUDLY -- at every bit of dated melodrama, which means they laughed a lot, and during moments I think are some top-rate filmmaking. Sure, it doesn't hold up in many respects to today's standards, but it was made almost 80 years ago. And it's still, I think, quite scary at times. Max Schreck is THE MOST FRIGHTENEING MOVIE GHOUL EVER (unfortunately he was meant to represent the Jewish plague destroying Germany at the time, but let's ignore this unflattering social context). The film's main drawback, however, is how its poor delineation between daytime and night-time clouds the resolution in confusion. With Murnau's "Sunrise," however, this is visually the best of the silent era. And the music was quite good.</fullReview>

The eerie ambiance and unique (and disquieting) feel to Count Orlok himself give a whole different feel to the vampire - this first vampire is not just a nasty human with fangs, a bad sun reaction, and a predilection for a fake central European accent - this is a cunning and vicious inhuman creature who you can be afraid of! While the story could be better (as is true of so many silent films) the stylish acting and the fantastic cinematography are what really make this film the classic that it is!

		<fullReview>this film in my opinion is the 2nd best horror film of all time. developed during the German expressionism movement (which was an arts movement that was less concerned with imitating reality and more concerned with using set design to reflect emotion and psychology) Nosferatu utilizes set design and a great score to the fullest. the sets themselves leave a grimy and sinister impression on the viewer. in particular count orlok's castle.. if that place doesn't give you the creeps i don't know what will. the castle is so dark, cold and old looking it gives off the vibe that nothing of human descent could possibly live there. don't even get me started on Max Schrek.. that guy is the world champion of scary looking men. i can honestly say he has the creepiest performance in a horror film that i've ever seen. this plus amazing direction, some other memorable performances from the cast, brilliant direction and the most in depth telling of Bram Stoker's classic tale of vampirism, makes this movie a true masterpiece of horror cinema. 10/10 (the only film to ever come close to the masterpiece that is..

		<fullReview>Nosferatu is a must-see for any serious vampire film fan, being the first cinematic realisation of Bram Stoker's infamous Count Dracula (albeit a completely unofficial and not entirely faithful version of Stoker's novel that changes the vampire's name to Count Orlok). That said, although Nosferatu's importance in horror movie history is incontrovertible, the film's outmoded expressionist performances and rather uneven pace mean that its worth as a piece of pure entertainment cannot be so easily determined.Max Schreck's creepy turn as the cadaverous, rat-like Count Orlok is amazingly effective and his character provides the film with its most iconic imagery: Orlok rising stiffly from his coffin as though hinged at the feet, and his distorted shadow creeping up a flight of stairs. Sadly Schreck's on-screen time only amounts to approximately nine minutes, and when the pointy-toothed one isn't around, the film becomes a far more leaden affair cursed with a dreadful central performance from Gustav von Wangenheim as buffoonish Jonathan Harker substitute Hutter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Effective Version Of Dracula</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror, is a classic German Expressionist horror film, directed by F. W. Murnau.It features Max Schreck as the vampire Count Orlok together with Gustav von Wangenheim,Greta Schrder, Alexander Granach,Ruth Landshoff and Wolfgang Heinz. It was an unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, with names and other details changed because the studio could not obtain the rights to the novel as for instance, "vampire" became "Nosferatu" and "Count Dracula" became "Count Orlok".The film begins in the Carpathian mountains, where real estate agent Hutter has arrived to close a sale with the reclusive Herr Orlok. Despite the feverish warnings of the local peasants, Hutter insists upon completing his journey to Orlok's sinister castle. While enjoying his host's hospitality, Hutter accidentally cuts his finger-whereupon Orlok tips his hand by staring intently at the bloody digit, licking his lips. Hutter catches on that Orlok is no ordinary mortal when he witnesses the vampire nobleman loading himself into a coffin in preparation for his journey to Bremen. By the time the ship bearing Orlok arrives at its destination, the captain and crew have all been killed-and partially devoured. There follows a wave of mysterious deaths in Bremen, which the local authorities attribute to a plague of some sort. But Ellen, Hutter's wife, knows better. Armed with the knowledge that a vampire will perish upon exposure to the rays of the sun, Ellen offers herself to Orlok, deliberately keeping him "entertained" until sunrise. At the cost of her own life, Ellen ends Orlok's reign of terror once and for all. One of the silent era's most influential masterpieces, Nosferatu's eerie, Gothic feel and a chilling performance from Max Shrek as the vampire set the template for the horror films that followed for many years to come.Murnau proved his directorial talent in this picture he's a master artisan demonstrating not only a knowledge of the subtler side of directing but in photography.It doesn't scare us anymore for present viewers but it haunts us. It shows not that vampires can jump out of shadows, but that evil can grow there, nourished on death.Finally,it is masterpiece of the German silent cinema and easily the most effective version of Dracula on record.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Each time I see a film like 'Nosferatu' from the silent time period I cannot help reflecting how different the experience of watching movies was in the first three decades of the history of cinema. Even today when the big equalizer of cinema watching which is the home TV screen and the elaborated music that now comes together with almost any silent film should bring the experience closer to watching a contemporary film, the feeling of watching a different type of films, with focus on the image quality and actors expressive skills almost derives in the feeling that I am watching a different art - one that may even come closer to deserve the numeral seven in the order of classical arts.The 1922 version of 'Nosferatu' is considered as the first horror and vampires film in history, the opener to a series of films inspired by Briam Stoker's 'Dracula' which by now seems endless and covers multiple genres beyond being a genre by itself. Is it a scary movie? Certainly not by the norms of the 21st century viewer. Yet one can find here many of the elements that will be used later not only by the Dracula series and vampire flicks, but also other genres of horror story- embryos of the Rocky Horror show are present in a scene where a science professor explains carnivore plants to his pupils, in other scenes rats and spiders show up in a premonition of their respective sub-genres. The quality of the film resides however in the complex settings, in the stylish costumes and in the camera work which brings to perfection the fixed camera style filling in the screen with shapes, movements, and suggestions. Also remarkable is the quality of the script and the fluidity of the story telling, F.W. Murnau succeeds to create a Gothic story with action plans which run in parallel just to meet at the maximum suspense point, a technique that will be used and brought to perfection later by directors like Hitchcock. And yes, the scenes that take place in Transylvania are quite well made, no big gaffes or historic mix-ups as it too often happens in other more recent 'Dracula' films. There is of course some real or fake ingenuity in the feminine character who sacrifices herself to the vampire for the greater community good, but this part is also in line with the quality naivety of other great silent movies.I have seen on the European ARTE TV channel the digitized version of the film, based on multiple sources from the German and Czech archives. Try to find to see this new version, it is worth the effort, and maybe to some extent closer to the original, although it is paradoxically the most recent.Director Murnau has left a legacy including this film and a few other considered today masterpieces of the German expressionist movie industry. By the the time he died the year was 1931, two or three years in the spoken film era, Murnau had moved to America, but never got to making the great movies of a career in the spoken film art, a career that we shall never know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best vampire movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens, is one the most haunting films I have seen and will probably remain in the top. All because of the creepy performance of Max Schreck as Graf Orlok and the use of expressionism from director F.W. Murnau. Orlok's hunched back, sharp teeth, long fingernails and vacant eyes come together for a frightening image of the villain that has since been copied by numerous other actors and filmmakers. While Bela Lugosi is more well-known for Dracula, I think that Schreck should get the prize for the creepiest vampire. His inhuman qualities leave no question as to his motives, even though he is on screen for no more than nine minutes of the film.The rest of the cast is not as notable. Gustav von Wangenheim plays the lead, Hutter, and can be described as campy at best. However, his over-the-top performance fits the film. His na?ve character must travel out to Count Orlok's castle in order to sell him some real estate. The location on the castle is actually in the Carpathian Mountains, which gives an eerie atmosphere to Hutter's trek into his death. Greta Schroeder's performance as Hutter's wife, Ellen, is also campy, but she gives a creepy performance during the time that she is possessed by Count Orlok. Alexander Granach is great as Knock, who works for "Master" Orlok.The most significant aspect of the film is of course the expressionist style used by Murnau. Despite using a real location, the setting is distorted and eerie to express intense emotions. The music and cinematography add to the tense scenes. One of my favorite shots is of Orlok ascending the stairs of the ship that he uses to stow away on his way to Wisborg. There are numerous other notable shots like the man putting crosses on the doors or the line of coffins coming down the road. For anyone unaccustomed to silent films, this film will seem slow, but it is still fascinating and tense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film for my film history class and was greatly impressed with it. Being of the 21st century and seeing films that have so much violence, blood, and gore in them it's a little bit hard to be scared from "classic" horror films. But if you set your mind into the pasts time state of mind, you get an appreciation for the film. The film is very suspenseful and from reviews I read by film critiques, very symbolic. When I watched it I didn't get the feeling of the effects of World War II on the population; though after reading the reviews and seeing the film, I can see the connection between the two. After reading the papers, I then understood the actions and fears the protagonist felt from his experience with Nosferatu. I can only imagine the horror the movie brought to audiences in its time. Never having seeing anything so horrific or terrifying on the screen before must have been a tremendous eerie feeling. The movie did drag on a bit, but the scenes of importance were well done and very entertaining. I loved the scene where he slowly rises from his slumber. That scene is infamous and still inspires film today! To have that affect on the cinema is outstanding. I was very surprised with the ending. Even today it is uncommon to not get your happy ending, but for that time, I just didn't see it coming. It was very surprising when his love died in his arms. The music was very eerie and gave the film its horror feeling. I loved the scene with the carriage and the speed it went. It truly did give the feeling of being in a supernatural state. Over all a good horror movie for its time that would have a lasting effect the film industry for years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the Dracula story. I have seen the Lugosi one so many times. The book has always been a favorite. This one has withstood the test of time wonderfully. First of all, make the Count (who goes by another name to avoid copyright infringement) about as ugly and unbent as one can be (he looks like he has pole shoved through his body), throw in the Carpathians and the Borgo Pass, and you have the makings of a delightful film. Harker is such a putz as he laughs his way into the culture of the Transylvanians. He is so cocky and sure of himself, walking confidently up to the castle. That doesn't last long. One look at Max Schrek and all those fine thoughts go right out the window. Escaping, he makes his way back to his home while the Count goes about his business. The ship, of course, has lost its entire crew and a stowaway was being investigated. The Captain tied himself to the wheel. As the evil arrives, the plague takes over the city. A weird character named Renfield is eating flies and spiders and seems to have a connection to the Count. I always remember the "stark raving mad" Dwight Fry who came to London with the Lugosi Dracula, with his haunting laugh. This is an older man who looks about as bizarre as a person can look. This is one of the charms of the silent piece. These people appear so strange. Even the more conventional characters: Harker, his wife Nina (to avoid Mina, of course) just look so strange. I know it's a silent film and faces needed oodles of makeup to be seen properly by the camera. But if I saw Nina on the street, I'm not so sure I wouldn't run the other way. It all gets resolved with great sacrifice. The story is a great one and despite some of the missing sensuality, it works quite well. It must have been quite a sight in its day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic that is worth to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was afraid I would never see this movie because it is hard to come by. Although not too long ago I finally was able to see it, the legendary Nosferatu. The black and white sets the mood right at the beginning of the movie. The castle, landscapes, they all fit perfectly in the movie. Max Schreck truly plays evil creature as if the role was made for him. The bald head, the pointy ears, frightening eyes, long fingernails, he really is someone you don't want to meet in a dark alley.There is a little downside to the movie though, because it's black and white the movie can be somewhat confusing. Sometimes you thinks it's day, and Nosferatu is walking around in the sunlight. (personally I think those scene's were shot in the daytime). And that's weird because vampire die when they get into the sun. Also one funny scene is when the Nosferatu is running around town with his coffin under his arm.When considered all, this is still a wonderful movie that you have must seen at least once in your lifetime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nosferatu--language and music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Nosferatu..." is an excellent example of an actor understanding the part so well, that the body language alone delivers the message. Schreck's creature becomes a snapshot memory, which is something very rare, even with all of today's gadgetry and technology. It has had so many countless imitations, albeit, many imitations not even realized as such by those who created them due to the timelessness of what Murnau and Schreck created (an example would be the nonhuman-like movements seen in many of today's Horror movies--jarred and "creepy" body movements seen in movies like "The Ring" and "Fear dot com", and the body images seen in many rock videos like those by Mariyln Manson and Steve Vai). So it is fair to say that "Nosferatu..." was a very progressive movie in its day, sexually charged and new. Also very progressive was the music that accompanied the film--dissonant chords abound, with a balance of symphony and American-influenced bass and "traps", creating an unsettling mix that keeps one on edge. Germany at that time was rich in the arts, but the music heard in "Nosferatu..." was very forward even in such a progressive cultural state.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murnau and Herzog bite the neck of Art.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Nosferatu Vampyr" (German, 1922): Directed by F.W. Murnau. This is the first film representation of Count Dracula, and, in my opinion, the best until 1979's "Nosferatu the Vampyre" by Werner Herzog. Extremely innovative for it's time, this is a film made of strong visual Art principles, and the exaggerated acting of the period. (Gee, I sort of MISS some of those "dramatic" poses, you know, like the woman who shows fear by leaning away and holding the back of her open hand against her mouth.) Murnau, working with Max Shreck (who played "Nosferatu"), creates a truly creepy world of dying light, and creeping shadows. (Also see "Shadow of the Vampire" with Willem Dafoe, about the real relationship between Murnau &amp; Shreck. Shreck was TOTALLY right for the part.) Movie making was a fairly new medium. Murnau experimented with stop action, the negative, editing, and the irrational, wonderful creation of "living" shadows. (Watch for an African HYENA also!) The music score on this particular issue was relentless pipe organ, which screamed for someone to step in and control it...if you sound loud and dramatic every single moment, you can neutralize the drama. (Turn off the music!) As best you can, ALWAYS try to view films within the context of the time it was made. This deepens the experience. A GREAT double feature, "compare/contrast" would be Murnau followed by Herzog.</fullReview>

Simply outstanding features for any movie. And when one comes to realize that it has been made in 1922, one comes to appreciate the true genius of F.W.Murnau. I would say that any true film enthusiast should have seen this movie at least a few times.

		<fullReview>Yes, this film is the first horror movie ever, as far as I'm concerned. I have read comments from people noting that this film was boring, and uninteresting; however, such viewers simply have neither taste nor a sense of film history. Plain and simple, although this film may not be frightening by modern standards, this movie represents the basis upon which every vampire film is based.Although the silent format presents accellerated and exaggerated emotional and physical performances--and a soundtrack which leaves something to be desired--the overall ambiance of the film is that of absolute creepiness. People forget that the soundtrack/sound effects are meant only as an approximation, and supplement to the visuals.This is standard viewing for anyone interested in horror movies (even though I would categorize this film as a suspense thriller)... A fantastic film whose only shortcomings arise as a result of technological limitations of early 20th century cinema and, what I feel to be, an aprubt ending. Murnau succeeded in freaking out even the most modern and supposedly "worldly" of movie-goers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently watched the silent film "Nosferatu." I usually keep an open mind with movies, but I really didn't think I was going to enjoy this. But, I actually liked it. A lot. For a black and white movie made in 1922 with no sound, it was an amazing movie. It was the first ever movie version of Dracula, and it had extremely wacky, over the top acting, which was highly entertaining. Although it was supposedly a horror movie, I though it was very comical and wild, but I mean that in a good way. It was extremely long, get it held my attention, probably more-so than the 30s Dracula with Bela Lugosi. All in all, it was really good, and a horror classic no doubt, that spawned a legacy like no other.</fullReview>

Though not all horror fans will like this movie, every person who calls himself or herself a true horror fan needs to see this, because it's one of the first real horror movies ever made. So we have this young man, who is traveling to Count Orlok's castle to try to sell him a house. When he goes to meet up with Count Orlok, weird things begin happening. We then find out that Count Orlok is actually a blood sucking vampire, and he wants to claim this young man's wife as his own.Now please be aware, that this film is what some people call 'Out Of Date' You have to be a true horror fan to be able to enjoy it for what it is and the fact that it is what made horror what it is today.Another group of people that this movie is a must see for, are the filmmakers. Even if your not a horror filmmaker, you still should see this movie. Any filmmaker who has access to see this movie, but doesn't, does not have any kind of real love for films. After you see this film, check out: NOSFERATU THE VAMPYRE and SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Scariest Horror before the 'Talkies' (maybe spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boo! Nosferatu is chilling, thrilling and its silence but grand symphony gives the film a Gothic atmosphere. F.W.Murnau's direction is okay, the acting looks a bit corny, but of coarse it was silent and hard to make out what the performers were doing. But Max Shreck was outstanding (and Shreck, in German means fright or terror!) his vampire performance chills your bones. He was the first vampire to have fangs in a motion picture and is predicted to be the most effective vampire to this day.Murnau didn't have rights to make the film (if you haven't noticed, it is a copy of Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' only with a few names changed) and in the end, Stoker's widow sued Murnau. All the prints were destroyed, but fortunately, or some people may say unfortunately the vampire survived! Murnau got away with a copy of Robert L. Stevenson's 'Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde' with 'Der Januskopf'.The film's appearance, style and direction combined together is a masterpiece. I think it is the scariest horror film before the talkies, Max Shreck is so greatly devoted into his character you never see the mortal soul inside him! When I got the video, I was deeply disappointed because the 'digitally remastered' film was sepia all the way through, not a mixture of different filters like any other silent film. And also the symphony wasn't in the film it was only in the title, in a few scenes it was rock music!The film is a classic horror and a fangtastic vampire is the cherry on top of it all, so sink your teeth into it!</fullReview>

"Nosferatu" is worthy of it's legendary status. While not perfect by any means, the atmosphere is indeed frightening. The plot of the movie itself is a simplified version of the novel.

		<shortDescription>Why this is still a classic, even eight decades later</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing with Nosferatu is, that despite the fact that there is no spoken dialog, the film is able to maintain a pretty high level of entertainment throughout. This is mainly achieved by Murnau's sharp style of directing, which only portrays the essential parts of the story and the great music by Erdmann. Another thing that makes this film worth while, is the fact that Murnau is able to put some ?special effects' into the film, which do not only make the film more interesting, but also astonishing, if one bears in mind that it was shot in 1922. I, for one cannot comment too much on the acting, but as far as I'm concerned, it was good as well and putting all elements together I'd have to say that Nosferatu is one tight package of silent film-making. Now I know that this film will not be for everybody, but if you are a film buff and you enjoy a good thrill, you should give this film a shot (that is if you do not oppose watching a silent film).8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't have a particular fondness for older silent films. Regardless of how influential they were, I always watch them with the same critical eye as any modern movie watcher, and if they don't age well, I tend to dislike them in spite of their "classic" mantel. 'Nosferatu' shows that good films do not die. The film is beautifully made and eerily haunting even though it's over eighty-years old. The producers were far ahead of their time, and audiences can see the early techniques that would eventually become the horror genre's mainstay. Max Schreck's resemblance to a vampire is still as disturbing today as it was over half a century ago, and a true movie afficionado has not lived until he or she has seen 'Nosferatu' played with a live orchestra.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It took Murnau to Hollywood and German Expressionism to new levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>German Expressionism was a very interesting movement which produced some great films. This happens to be my favourite of them all, which i have studied at great length. Nosferatu, the unofficial Count Dracula, was F.W. Murnau's masterpiece which cemented his name in history.The widow of Bram Stoker found out about this unoffficial work, and was very angry with the production team. She won a court ruling which was to have every copy of this film destroyed. It is quite ironic that no matter how hard that they tried to kill Nosferatu, he still survived. A negative was found in London and restored. Even more ironic is the fact that the work she hated and tried to destroy, is the best adaption of her late husband's work, and it also made their family name.The underlying theme of this film is the relationship between Hutter's wife and Nosferatu the Vampyre. The film employs very clever geographical cuts, to show us the passion building between them, which cleverly culminates in their `love` scene at the end. As with the common story, she gives herself to Nosferatu, which is what kills him.Hutter's failed masculinity is key to the plot. When he cuts the flowers and Ellen seems distressed; this is symbolic of that fact that they haven't consumated their relationship. Hutter is a very enthusiastic character, and very easily led, yet he is ultimately a failure. Just a pawn in the tragic love story between Nosferatu and Ellen.I could talk about this film for ever. many people may find it hard going, and a tad ridiculous. The special effects are obviously outdated, and non movie fanatics may be put off because of the fact is it black and white, and also a silent film. However, subtitled or silence do not make a bad film.This film is near to perfection as you can get with the techniques available to Murnau. If it wasn't for his untimely death, he might have gone on to very big things in Hollywood. Herzog made a remake of this Murnau classic, in colour and with sound. The names changed slightly, but the film was dreadful. It was typical Herzog, yet still managed to fail dismally.If you only watch one film by Murnau, watch this one</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The standard for primal terror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>F. W. Murnau's classic film "Nosferatu: Eine Symphonie Des Grauens", or "Nosferatu: A Symphony Of Horror" has appeared in many incarnations since its debut in 1922. Some, like the 1979 remake "Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht" have been bold revisions, others, like the version featuring the debatable talents of goth band Type O Negative, have been painful. But to explore why this is the standard by which all other vampire movies must be judged, one must look to the original.The plot is simple. Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim), a real estate agent, is contacted by Knock (Alexander Granch), and odd man and servant to Count Graf Orlok (Max Schreck). The Count would like to buy a house in town. Hutter travels to the Count's remote castle, where he encounters a hideous and disturbing man. Orlok travels back to town, where he falls in love with Hutter's virtuous wife Ellen (Greta Schroder), meanwhile bringing death and the plague with him. It is, of course, and adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel "Dracula" with the names changed, the narrative stripped to its essentials, and virtually all secondary characters removed.Many people doubt that a movie made 80 years ago, without the graphic wizardry of modern technology, could be anything near frightening. This is far from the truth. The terror inherent in the film rests almost entirely on Schreck's stooped shoulders. Orlok is a vile and frightening thing, a creature whose inner darkness and insaitable want have been epitomized in its grotesque features. The silent nature of the film works wonders with this, as one cannot imagine a voice hideous enough to match the Count's twisted form. Orlok is not the suave, refined, mildly campy vampire of Bela Lugosi or even Gary Oldman. He is a primal monster, born of nightmare and fear.Despite Orlok's amazingly chilling performance, one cannot forget the direction of F. W. Murnau, who provides sets and angles that uniquely convey the dread inherent to the vampire's threat. His linking of Orlok to the plague is particularly interesting, as the plague contains all of the terror and chaos of the vampire itself, but it is a wholly natural phenomenon. The organ score heightens the mood even further, but the score on the most recent DVD release by the Silent Orchestra is just as good as a layered, multi-textual alternative.In a cinematic landscape where a horror film is judged on the amount and extreme nature of graphic killings displayed, many may see "Nosferatu" as a relic or even worse, as a bore. Yes, the acting may seem overdone, and the special effects are certainly primitive by modern standards. But the essence of "Nosferatu" is how it can distill the most ancient form of fear into a film, into one horrible, terrifying character. For this reason alone, it is a must for any fan of cinema, and certainly required viewing for any horror fan. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quality early vampire film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>F.W. Murnau brought us this quality early vampire film. It's surprisingly effective for it's time. By today's standards, it's pretty tame and the count looks a bit goofy, but I bet in 1922 it was pretty scary...like when he rises out of the coffin. It's quite an innovative film. It wasn't just in black and white, but used different color tints to signify different lighting (blue for night, yellow for candlelight, etc), which really made it more realistic. It had nice fades between the scenes and use of negative film for some interesting effects. The scenery shots at the beach were beautifully shot and they worked well to contrast the tighter interior shots. It had most of the key elements in a Dracula movie; Taking different forms, hypnotic telepathy, a good Renfield character, no sunlight, etc. Though his reflection did show in the mirror. The DVD I watched had a choice of two audio tracks: The Silent Orchestra or an Organ score composed and performed by by Timothy Howard. I sampled them both in the beginning and a couple times throughout the movie, but the organ won out. The orchestra was well done, but the simple organ music added to the eeriness of the movie. A must see for the fans of the genre or early film.*** (out of 4)</fullReview>

Murnau was years ahead of his time with his use of location shooting, camera techniques, and speed up motion. Max Schreck as Count Orlok(Dracula)remains 80 some years later the most horrifying of all vampires and what nightmares are made of. Although not blood and guts scary by todays standards, Nosferatu still has the ability to haunt and stay with you for quite some time.

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie I was 9 years old. I collected the old horror movies and cherished them. I still do. This movie really didn't seem scary when I was 9. To me it was just a silent movie. I also thought it had great acting and makeup. Now I look at it differently. One night I was watching a show on T.V. about Dracula and it showed scenes from Nosferatu. My brother said it was silent, but he told me to watch the way Nosferatu was moving in one scene. It is the scene when Harker or Hutter is in his room and he hears someone coming. At this point he is scared stiff. He actually goes to his bed and tries to hide. All of a sudden the door flies open on its own and behind it is Nosferatu. He starts slowly moving into the room. I watched it myself alone in the dark and it was scary. I said to myself, "He's moving like he's not even human." Seeing him walk like that was very scary. Also seeing that face and those monstrous hands. Nosferatu is a great movie. Check it out and pay no attention to what you see in the movie Shadow of the Vampire. See this movie of the first Dracula and one of the first horror movies put on screen. See this movie, but don't see it alone in a dark room. Nosferatu will make your blood cold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a film you can sink your teeth into -- or vice versa!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes the first remains the best. Even if one divorces oneself from the historical context which makes Nosferatu truly a giant film-or is too ignorant to even consider it, the W.F. Murnau classic still stands on its own as a truly eerie and spine-tingling gem.What I am actually reviewing is the digitally re-mastered and color-tinted VHS version which includes some long-lost footage. (It had been so long since I had seen the film in its entirety that I was unable to tell for sure what footage may have been re-added.) This version of the original is a wonderful work, bringing Murnau's outstanding cinematography and early camera work to light. I don't know if the original 1922 version possibly had color tinting or not. If not, then I question the appropriateness of it being used today. Still, the red/maroon, magenta and blue tones are quite effective in evoking mood and in emphasizing both the great period camera work and the superb restoration of the film.Nosferatu still stands as a unique vampire movie. The ending, which I will not give away, is unique among vampire films, as far as I know. So, too, is the bizarre physical appearance of Max Schreck, as Count Orlok. (I would like to learn more about the man. I had always heard that he was a circus freak and that very little makeup was needed for his Nasferatu performance. His IMDb bios, however, do not seem to support this.) However much help Schreck (which means `terror' in German, incidentally) needed in achieving the Count Orlok look, he turns in a riveting performance and creates one of the screen's most hideous and memorable images. Murnau, whose death at age 42 in 1931 tragically cut short his career, shows a great flair for Gothic horror. Building on the early German surrealistic works like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, he makes full use of Orlok's hideously long fingers and spider-like appearance in shadows and other haunting images.Gustov von Wangenheim perfectly captures the quintessential modern man as Hutter, the bright young real estate agent, sent by his eccentric boss to try to sell an abandoned home in their town to a mysterious Transylvanian count. Wise in the age of reason, Hutter laughs at the superstitions of Transylvanian peasants who refuse to take him to Orlok's castle-or even to venture into `The Land of Phantoms' after dark. A manic ride in a ghostly stage-all the more eerie in the restored, properly speeded version, in which its double-time speed stands in stark contrast to the normal movements around it-and the count's disconcerting reaction when Hutter cuts his thumb, however, begin to weaken his rationalistic outlook.Although the acting still reeks more of the stage than the mature screen, it fits the bizarre tale quite well. Murnau's daring (and unheard of, at the time) move to shoot most of the film on location in Transylvania adds to the impressive realism and cinematic beauty of the film. His images, tinted or not, are striking, such as the now-insane realtor Knock (Alexander Granach) peering out of his asylum window and seeing the silhouette of the death ship gliding into the harbor with Orlok aboard.Cinematic art has come a long way since 1922. One reason it has, though, is the great work of innovative directors like W.F. Murnau. His Nosferatu stands the test of time. A textbook study for film students, it is nevertheless a vampire film that still has bite after 80 years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even the most illiterate film-goer would feel a sense of familiarity at a glimpse of Max Schreck's Count Orlock. That in a nutshell sums up how essential and influential this film has become.A half-disguised adaptation of Bram Stocker's Dracula, with names and locations altered for legal reasons, Murnau's Nosferatu is the granddaddy of all vampire films and, to this day, one of the very best and most disturbing. Minimalist and eerie cinematography, a simple yet efficient structure and a horrific title character design make this more than merely enduring. Forget Bela Lugosi, Christopher Lee or even Gary Oldman: Max Schreck's rodent-like, unclean horror is the ultimate vampire. this character alone propelled the film into legend and is what nightmares are made of. Only Klaus Kinski ever came close in what was, tellingly, an intriguing remake of this film.This is a recommended starting point if you are new to silent films. It may not be as accessible as Metropolis or visually stunning as The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, but it amply deserves its reputation, if only for continuing to evoke fear and unease 84 years after it was first released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest horror film of our time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made in 1922, this original silent classic, is the greatest vampire film of all time. Possibly, the greatest horror film of all time. Aside from the high ranking THE EXORCIST, this film towers among all of the many other classic films. This is the most enduring vampire film ever made. Based on Bram Stroker's classic tale, NOSFERATU is a true classic that will live in film history forever. After you are done viewing this film, you might be interested in watching SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE, a film based on this one's creation. F.W. Mernau has created a classic with Max Shreck as the mysterious Count Orlock. See this movie. I recommend it to everyone. This is a towering masterpiece of horror.....5/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film with a few good moments...nothing more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you can't get the rights to a book you want to make into a movie, just change the name of the main characters and you got yourself a classic horror film. Nosferatu, known to many American's as the German Dracula, is an early horror film that has stand the test of time for one reason, the guy who plays Nosferatu. Like the movie K-PAX, the audience is only interested in the film when the main character (Kevin Spacey / Nosferatu) is on the screen. When the main event is not on the big screen, the film becomes a giant bore. The rest of the film is an average film from the 1920's. The magic that makes Nosferatu is Nosferatu himself. The outrageous makeup and costume, to the manner in which he walks and moves makes him true eye candy in the sense of the word.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far the greatest vampire movie ever made, and one of the best horror films, if not the very best, of all time. Nosferatu, or Count Orlok, is, in my own opinion, the creepiest and coolest looking movie "monster" I've ever seen. Freddy Kruger, Hellraiser, the Frankenstein's monster, none of them hold a candle to the vampire played masterfully by Max Schreck.To say that Max Schreck steals the show would be an understatement. Max Schreck played the role Nosferatu incredibly. Even after almost 80 years, Nosferatu is still scary, disgusting, mysterious and fascinating all at the same time, all thanks to the perfect performance by Schreck.F.W. Murnau does an excellent job as director of this film. The atmosphere and artistry he created in this film is what helped make it the classic it is today. I believe this is the first film in which two events happening at once are intercut. This is a common routine among movies now, but it's Murnau that helped pioneer it using this film.The only flaw I noticed watched this movie was the acting of Gustav von Wangenheim. I understand that for silent films like this one, a little overacting might be necessary, but I found Gustav to be annoying and distracting, and not very convincing at all in his role. He overacted WAY too much, and the fact that it's a silent film can't be used as an excuse for it. Max Schreck gave a brilliant performance, and Greta Schrder did a good job too, so there is no reason Gustav couldn't have.This tiny flaw hardly dampers the experience of this movie, however. It is definitely one of the best I've ever seen, and although it probably would not make my Top 10 list, it certainly makes my Top 20. This movie is highly recommended, not just horror movie fans, but for fans of movies in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematic Milestone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having recently had the pleasure of seeing a screening of this film played from a 16mm film and aided with a LIVE organ playing in the background, Nosferatu was a TRUE film experience. The movie is an early treasure of cinematic gold, using inventive camera angles, creating moving, sweeping, haunting atmospheres, and telling one of the greatest stories of horror for the first time. Many reviewers have already gone into great depth about the background of the film and its cinematic importance. I have little to add, yet must say that if you have not seen Nosferatu then please do so. F. W. Murnau directs with great style, and Max Schreck easily makes one of the most haunting, scariest monsters to befall the screen. I found the ending a bit...well, not on par with the rest of the film. In fact, the first half is the best as Nosferatu leaves his home after having been visited by a Jonathan Harker type character. Of all the screen versions of Dracula, the representation of Dracula is most accurately portrayed in Murnau's Nosferatu...long fingernails, pointed rat-like ears, and so on. Again if you have not seen it, do so and take a look at movie-making history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" is considered the first horror movie. It's an exemplary good film, in its own right, but I wouldn't consider it as terryfing as this one.In this age, where special effects have replaced plot, and where thrills are represented by a loud noise, followed by an unexpected apparition, Nosferatu shines. This is a movie that preys on your inner fears, where slowly opening doors play with your imagination and make you feel scared just because of what might happen next, where the crude special effects are not the goal, but a medium. After a while, you will notice that Nosferatu's image will become embedded with your worst fears.Sadly, as it has been said before, the print for this movie is very badly beaten. But don't worry. Even this adds to the ambiance.It's worthy to note that most of the locations where this film was made are still standing, just because the filmmaker chose those that were already historic by the time he made the picture. This is shown in amazing detail in the DVD editions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a classic, not more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this one time on tv, and recently on the big screen. This showing was supported by a live organ play (directly composed for the movie), which suited perfectly. Nosferatu is a good, maybe even a great film, but only if you see it as classic. It is the first vampire movie, it is the first big Murnau feature and it set the tone for hundreds of followers. I can appreciate how innovative Murnau uses light and shadows in this typical expressionistic manner and why this must have been a scary film in the 20ies, but it does not scare me today. I like the 1979 version of Werner Herzog more, because it has better performances and, of course, better dialogue(: But if you are interested in the history of film, you have to check this one out.</fullReview>

Though it isn't without its flaws, the acting is parts is god damn awful even for its time and the soundtrack for the remastered version was terrible, how you can mix rock music with a 1922 classic silent movie and keep up the same atmosphere is impossible, they deserved to get sued as well for taking Stoker's work without permission but luckily a few copies survived the process when they were ordered to be destroyed Overall though pure excellence and if your tired of all the modern day rubbish horrors today check this one out</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Creepiest Vampire Ever Committed To Celluloid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simple Fact: The 1922 Nosferatu film is a masterpiece-F.W Murnau certainly knew how to frighten and amaze. The actors in Nosferatu all know how to act, but Max Schreck steals every scene he's in and looks every inch the ratty, vile vampyre, certainly the closest to Bram Stoker's book, in that he seems decrepit and ancient, but he's actually faster and more powerful than you could ever imagine. Watch this in a darkened room and you probably be creeped out. (Incidentally,'Schreck',as I'm sure many people know, is a German word for 'fright' or 'terror'. This wasn't a publicity stunt! It was his real name.) It is true that Bela Lugosi's iconic performance in 'Dracula' immortalised him in film history and is very enjoyable (see my review for 'Dracula'), but it lacks the threat and downright evil of Schreck's. Certainly a must-see.</fullReview>

The influences are still being felt from this groundbreaking film and vampire fans will find this wonderful creation priceless .

		<shortDescription>Artistry in silent classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with films like 'Nosferatu, eine Symphony des Grauens' is that they are easily admired but harder to enjoy. I can not think of a modern audience that would really like to see a movie like this. I enjoyed the artistry of the film, the images (there are a great deal of memorable ones), therefore I was able to have a great time, but how many people these days will see the brilliance in some of the shots? My guess is not so many.Director F.W. Murnau's version of the Dracula-story is one of the best known silent films and that could be a reason for people to see it. But I have to be honest here. Other well-known silent classics are better films to start with if you want to give them a try. 'The Battleship Potemkin' (1925) from Sergei Eisenstein still has a lot of its impact, Chaplin's 'The Gold Rush' (1925) still feels sweet and funny, Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis' (1927) contains many more memorable images. Maybe all this is just a matter of opinion. Still, there are images you definitely will remember and although they are not scary in the modern sense they are kind of creepy.Especially the scenes where Graf Orlok (or Dracula, played by Max Schreck) suddenly appears have quite some impact. I will not go into the story, which follows most of Bram Stoker's story pretty closely, since for me it is not really about the story. Besides the images we have the Schreck-performance and appearance which is completely different from every other Dracula we know. Bela Lugosi's Dracula in the 1931 film has become the standard for Dracula in the movies. Schreck looks more like a rat than a bat and instead of a charismatic man (like Lugosi and Gary Oldman in Francis Ford Coppola's version from 1992) he is ugly and creepy. It helps the silent version. His appearance fits Murnau's haunting images and there is a shot where Schreck erects from a coffin which belongs to the best remembered scenes from the silent era. If Schreck would have looked like a gentleman the power of the shot was probably lost.See 'Nosferatu' if you are interested in things like this, for its place in the history of cinema, to admire the work of one of the greatest director's the world has known.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The finest classic version of the Dracula story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu is Dracula in all but name. The story surrounding to the rights to film Bram Stoker's classic novel is well known, so I wont repeat it; but all I can say is thank god that not every copy was burned! Nosferatu is easily the best of the classic cinematic Dracula's and is, of course, a huge success for both silent cinema and the horror genre in it's own right. F.W. Murnau is one of the greatest directors of the silent era, and although he would go on to better this film with both Faust and Sunrise years afterwards, Nosferatu still stands out as one of the man's huge successes. It's his direction that makes the film what it is a lot of the time, as he expertly captures each sequence and makes the film frightening, mysterious and even funny in all the right places. The plot follows the classic Dracula story (albeit with names changed), and we see Hutter, an estate agent, travel to Count Orlok's castle in order to sell him a property in London. After buying the property, Orlok travels to London where he tries to take Hutter's lovely wife Ellen for himself.Max Schreck's performance as the vampire, Count Orlok, is so amazingly convincing that it has had a film made in tribute to it! 2000's Shadow of the Vampire works from the idea that Schreck really was a vampire, and judging by his performance in this film - that might even have been true! Silent acting is hard to rate, but good performances always shine through and a good performance is definitely what Murnau got out of Schreck. Seeing him on screen here, it's hard to imagine that he was ever anything else in real life. And there aren't many performances throughout cinema history that one can say that for! The atmosphere is very well done, and Murnau ensures it is always macabre and I can imagine that this film would have scared a few people upon its German release in 1922. This film would go on to be remade in 1979 by the talented team of Werner Herzog and Klaus Kinski, and while their version was very good - Murnau's version will always be better, and although it has obviously dated a lot; Nosferatu will always be seen as one of the true classics of the horror genre. This is one of those films that every film fan must see - so if you haven't already, don't wait too long!</fullReview>

It's never boring, in fact i found it engrossing with amazing performances all around, plus, the ending is fantastic!. Ot has a lot of creepy scenes, especially when Nosferatu is aboard and walking around on the ship, plus, i believe it made it even creepier since it was silent and without a music score, plus, Max does not have that much screen time and that just makes him scarier. This is the best Vampire film ever made as far as i'm concerned it's also one of the best horror films ever made as well. The Direction is fantastic!. F.W. Murnau does a fantastic job with creating eerie mood, great scenery, and overall doing a fantastic job. There is no gore except a tiny cut on thumb.. The Acting is AMAZING!. Max Schrek gives an incredible performance here as Count Orlock, he is extremely creepy and those eyes, plus that slow creepy walk of his, and had some memorable dialog, his performance here will always be remembered!. Gustav Von Wangenheim is great as Hutter, he was very likable, had great chemistry with Greta Schrder was very believable, and his character was cool!. Greta Schrder is awesome here she was really into her role, and those eyes and shocked face expressions on her face were priceless, excellent job!.Alexander Granach is great as the crazy guy. Overall You must see this it's a required viewing for any horror fan! especially classic ones!, it's one of the best horror films out there! ***** out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is based on Dracula by Bram Stoker, but since it wa illegal at the time to copy the book to film (that was got the first Dracula film, Drakula, lost) F. W. Mureau changed it up. Dracula is now Graf Orlock, better known as Nosferatu ("undead" in Romanian). Rather than a sexy Hungarian, Orlock is clearly inhuman. his is batlike with pointed ears and claws. his fangs are also different. Like a rodent, his slashers are his two front teeth.Bela Lugosi is pathetic. Who's scared of that? Max Schreck is the best Dracula ever, of course he's not really Dracula. His makeup is perfect, the whole batlike features are excellent. Even today he is cool looking. Imagine seeing it in 1922! German expressionism was in top form in this period, but Nosferatu surprisingly shows little of that. It is certainly different looking from The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari. Many of the characters (and this is straight out of German silent cinema) have odd names. Van Helsing is now Bulwer (his role is minor in this), Jonathan Harker is now Thomas Hutter, and Reinfield is recreated as Knock ( a very different character from the other. But the film is great. A silent masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My thoughts about "Nosferatu".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bleak and dusty like an ancient grave, "Nosferatu" is perfect Halloween viewing (or anytime). Technically crude by today's standards, but remarkably inventive, it retains its ability to chill even to this day.Of course a contemporary audience is not going to respond to a horror film the same way an audience in 1922 did, but I wonder what people thought of this movie when it was originally released. Watching it is a very weird experience. Modern films have the benefit of sound to help startle the audience, but "Nosferatu" was made before that aspect of filmgoing was introduced. Even so, there are a few shots in this film that remain startling, such as Count Orlok rising up out of his coffin bolt upright, seemingly on a hinge. Another more subtle scene that has a strong effect is when Hutter works himself up by reading the "Book of Vampires" and then looks outside of his room to see the vampire count standing across the hall. We've already seen Orlok for several scenes in the film, and yet the sight of him without his hat and glowering wide-eyed at Hutter is shocking.Another of the unique aspects of the movie is the intriguing set design, particularly Count Orlok's castle, which is depicted as a ruin from the outside and practically a tomb on the inside. Orlok's performance as the vampire is the centerpiece of the movie, especially his makeup. His face is barely human, with grossly overgrown eyebrows, rat-like fangs, and a face that is not much more than a skull. The fingernails are hideously long and sharp. I've always wondered about his clothes, too. How does a vampire like Count Orlok decide what to wear?When the action shifts to Bremen, the claustrophobic design of the city is remarkable. Watch for a great sequence when Knock (the Renfield character) is chased through the narrow streets by an angry mob.One of my favorite films to revisit, "Nosferatu" is scrutinized by film scholars and critics. I like it simply because it's a one-of-a-kind movie.</fullReview>

It may be a bit tiresome to watch if you are not used to reading all the dialogs (which come rather sparingly) but it has a lot of dark spirit in it.The effects used in this movie are stunning for the time and through there crudeness (seen with todays eyes) become even more spooky! Many times will the viewer have to understand the contents of conversations from what the actors are doing on the screen, so not everything is spoken out, even if you at times would wish for more clarity... but things just are that way now and I would feel out of place to truly criticize this movie for not being clear enough.Max Schreck is most certainly the king of terrifyingly looking vampires on screen. If I had to chose between being bitten by him or by the Christopher Lee vampire, I would feel more comfortable around Christopher! He'd just be that tad more charming in a way.The cracking of the music is just another thing that adds to the flair of oddness and the scenes with landscape are just as fitting in the movie as all the rest is.Highly recommended for all vampire or old movie fans!9/10 </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>His real name is Dracula; Nosferatu is nothing but a pseudonym ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Nosferatu" is the first, but illegal film version of Bram Stoker's classic "Dracula". Why illegal? Well, not more than a few years after Bram Stoker wrote this bestseller, a film was made of that book. Only no one had ever asked his permission to do so. But the author never had a court case, because it was a German film version with a different title and a slightly changed story. But still, the main part of this film was exactly the same as in the book. Simply anyone could see that "Nosferatu, eine symphonie des grauens" (as this was going to be the full name of the film) was an immediate adaptation of the book "Dracula" by Bram Stoker. Even so, "Nosferatu" is an exceptional piece of work and a true classic. It's one of the best Dracula-films ever made. It has meant a great deal to future horror films. Even today this film has the same importance as when it came out in 1922. Not so long ago, an unsuccessful adaptation of this film was released under the name `Shadow of the vampire' starring John Malkovich and Willem Dafoe. Because the film is in colour, I don't give it much credit. The original version is much, much better.Director F.W. Murnau proves in this film that the use of light in a film is simply indispensable: since you can't have any shades or shadows without light. In a great way, Murnau works with awe-inspiring shadows in order to demonstrate the power and magic of light. These sinister silhouettes are great special effects and perfect for creating a dark and threatening atmosphere. They are, of course, the silhouettes of the evil monster Nosferatu. After all, he is the one who causes all the panic and fear. In an excellent combination with this special light/shadow-work, Murnau also uses very original camera shots alternated with fade-ins and fade-outs; that only appear once in a while. The music is very important in this film, as this is a silent film. There's absolutely no talking involved and in order to break the silence, beautiful piano music is used in the film. But the most important meaning of this music is not to entertain the viewer, but to ascertain the thrilling atmosphere of the film. And that is why this piano music is (besides beautiful) both creepy and gripping. Overall the acting is good, but Max Schreck as the pale and skeletal vampire is unforgettable. His fantastic performance has really made the difference to this film. It might just be the greatest Dracula-related performance ever. You might not expect this from a thriller-horror classic of the early 20s, but sometimes this film is quite funny. Of course, it is more black humour that we're talking about, as we are actually amused with other people's suffering. All things considered, this is a most important film that has had a lot of influence on all similar horror films that were still to follow: an impressive picture that keeps on fascinating! To call this film a classic would be an understatement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I think of horror films from my era, the good ones are films like Angel Heart, Halloween and Nightmare On Elm Street. They all used tecniques to scare like shadows, great lighting, dark images and a truly scary villain. And I must admit that while I am not a true fan of classic cinema ( I absolutely despised Citizen Kane ) I have to say that maybe some of the best horror films from our times have Nosferatu to thank. The use of shadows and imagery in this film is quite impressive. And seeing that it is a silent film the atmosphere has to be that much better to achieve its desired mood. And it does that here. I first saw this film in my first year film studies class at Carleton U. I had heard all the broohaha about it and it didn't disappoint. It sent chills through me and that is what I admired about it. Yes, it is dated and that is why older films don't have the same effect on me as modern ones, but this one holds up quite well to films in our time. If you ever come across a copy of this, take a chance on it. You may see some Carpenter, some Craven and even some Hitchcock in here. And it will surprise you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nightmarish gem from the Expressionistic era of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many kids nowadays won't get this movie. They'll say it's stupid, boring, black and white, not enough sex, profanity, or violence to hold the attention of their rap-corroded brains. Indeed, this film isn't for everyone, not just the demographic above. But to the right sliver of viewers, 'Nosferatu' is a triumph.It's basically the classic plot of Bram Stoker's 'Dracula', only with details changed. ( Count Dracula becomes Count Orlok, Harken becomes Hutter, and Orlok follows him back to Germany, not Britain.) Max Schreck completely steals the show. As he slinks through shadows, purses his hideous rodent features, moves like an animated corpse, and springs from his coffin and into your imagination, you never once gain a doubt that he isn't the freakish vampire you see. There is no charisma in 'Nosferatu', no sex appeal or eroticism. Count Orlok inhabits a realm of nightmares, not a realm of earthly evils. His appearance is alien, his behavior is inhuman, and his feats of power unholy. He can turn intangible in the movie and seems to be telekinetic as well. The special effects of 1922 are laughably outdated by todays standards, but the film does a remarkably good job of balancing what you see with what is going on. His coffin, assembling itself piece by piece into a cart at irregular intervals, is a surreal experience. It's distorted, fractured, bizarre, and crooked: far more terrifying than the way-too-real aesthetics provided by modern day CGI.This film is a classic and one that has long provided much examination to film students throughout the world. You can't call yourself a true connoisseur of film without having seen F.W. Murnau's magnum opus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Max Schreck's performance is unquestionably remarkable (and highly unique among all the romanticized Bela Lugosi impersonations found in most other vampire movies), "Nosferatu" as a whole didn't impress me. My disappointment may just have been a result of the particular version I saw--namely, the 60-minute Americanized version in which all the names had been changed back to match the original Dracula story (Dracula, Harker, Renfield, etc.). Even so, however, it definitely didn't meet my expectations.Of course, as with any "classic" movie, there are many good things to say about it. Schreck is phenomenal. His performance alone makes the movie worthwhile. Technically the film was far ahead of its time, making new innovations in camera work and special effects. (The makeup on Schreck is believable even to this day.) And the film as a whole certainly has its moments. The best scene in the whole movie, I think, comes when the ship floats peacefully into the perfectly calm, quiet harbor of Bremen...the eerie calm of the scene masks the terrible cargo the ship carries on board. (And you don't even see the vampire!)Nevertheless, the flaws of this movie definitely outweigh the positives. There is a distracting subplot involving Renfield which comes out of nowhere and doesn't connect at all to the rest of the movie. Aside from Schreck and the actor playing Renfield, the acting is so-so at best (the actor playing Harker is particularly hammy). I can't forget the awful, awful score, which featured among its many glorious moments a highly out-of-place jazz interlude and (most hilariously) "Renfield's Theme," a bouncy circus melody which played every time Renfield was on screen (and reminded me way too much of "Torgo's Theme" in Manos: Hands of Fate--which is not a compliment). The score, of course, may have just been added to the Americanized version I saw. But the topper was the fact that, although Count Orlock/Dracula is supposed to die if exposed to sunlight, he spends half of his onscreen time wandering around outside in the middle of the afternoon (as evidenced by the obvious shadows all over the place).See "Shadow of the Vampire" instead. Willem Dafoe is just as good as Orlock as Max Schreck was, and his character is much more defined and nuanced and interesting. (The climax is also much more thrilling and--well, climactic.) I give this movie a 5/10, almost entirely on the strength of Schreck as an actor (as you can tell, I can't say enough about it). Otherwise, "Nosferatu" doesn't satisfy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the perfect setting for seeing this film classic- in a historic theatre with working original organ played as the silent film background. Sadly, it was simply consistently disappointing. Though historically interesting (e.g. seeing special effects ingenuity with 1920s technology), nothing could save this overall sleeper of a silent film. I believe that what we have in the high rating here (and for many old films), is that only those who adore all old films have seen and rated them-- highly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once underrated, now very much overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems to be "mainstream" to say that any film from before the 30's is a great film, when in fact, that's not true at all. There were - believe it or not - some terrible films. Dare I say it, Nosferatu is one of them.The movie lacks a protagonist, is terribly paced, and we are never really properly introduced to any characters. We think "Ok, this guy doesn't believe in vampires," and "Ok, this guy is scary," but none of them ever feel like real people, because none of them act like real people.If it wasn't for the groundbreaking effects and bone-chilling cinematography, make-up, and acting on Max Schreck's part, there really wouldn't be anything to like about this film. Nonetheless, it certainly is creepy, so for a horror flick, I suppose it succeeds. As a decent film, it does not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See how Nosferatu, the oldest of horror movies still has fangs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of each genre that has experimented with it, black and white photography seems to have been used better in horror. And it's ironic considering that a lot of amateur filmmakers want to make the next big scary movie, and almost all are shot in traditional color. Though simplistic, black and white photography in horror cinema to me is like the ultimate battle of light and darkness. The light representing the good and peace of mankind and the black revealing the darkest of shadows and the true tone of eclipsed mystery. The world's that are already bleak, suddenly takes a turn when the movie is done in a German Expressionistic style.Believe it or not, if you've seen any Tim Burton film (Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Frankenweenie, etc?) then you have an idea what German Expressionism is about; looking at the ideas of madness and insanity in a more visual style. Dark shadows fill with terror and abstract visuals are welcomed. Speaking of Germany, this country has given the world a lot of interesting stories from the dystopian future of Metropolis to the eerie tone of Cabinet of Doctor Caligari. But I'm here today to examine it's view on vampires in Nosferatu.This is actually an interesting retelling of Dracula. Apparently, the studio could not obtain the rights to produce the Bram Stocker novel, so they took the same formula, and changed the names in an attempt to make it their own.It opens with lawyer Thomas Hutter who is being sent to Transylvania to visit a new client named Count Orlok. He bids farewell to his fianc Ellen and entrusts his friends Harding, and Harding's sister Annie to look after her. Close to his destination, he comes to an Inn where he is warned by villagers to not go to the Orlok's castle at night.He arrives to find Count Orlok (played by Max Schreck) to be a thin, almost terrifying man to look at. He continues his assignment, aside from the strange occurrences from puncture marks on his neck to Orlok almost sucking the blood from his thumb. Orlok signs the documents to buy the house across from Hutter as the lawyer starts to suspect that Orlok may be Nosferatu, "The Bird of Death". Hutter escapes, but Nosferatu ends up shipping his body out in the seas where he continues to attack each sailor one by one. He eventually reaches Hutter's town, as the young man must race to save his fianc.If a silent movie should be watched around Halloween, then Nosferatu is the best answer. Though not as recognized as the Bela Lugosi Dracula, this vampire story is just as atmospheric and a tad creepier. The German Expressionistic tone only makes the scenario scarier and Max Schreck becomes one with the matching scenery as the chilling Count Orlok. I remember watching this for the first time when I was a freshman in college, and this gave me fighting dreams for two days. I can still see that demonic creature whenever I close my eyes.As silent movies go, this is one of the best ones (certainly best of the horror silent). I have yet to see the Lon Chaney Phantom of the Opera or Hunchback of Notre Dame, so I can't make too much of a comparison. But I will say that these images are the ones that inspired men like Tim Burton to continue to show new light on this kind of expressionism. It's played in many film classes for a good reason; it's the grandfather of horror. Nosferatu probably won't sway modern movie goers, but this is a must for any fan of horror or Tim Burton.I'll give this ten shadows of Count Orlok out of ten. As dark as the castle that it sits in, Nosferatu is a bleak, but beautifully crafted tale of Dracula is in the National Film Registry for a reason. See why this old film is worth preserving.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm twenty years old and consider myself a horror buff, but sadly my biggest weakness is my lack of knowledge of pre-70's horror. That's why a decided I had to see Nosferatu!Nosferatu is the first film to be based upon Bram Stoker's Dracula. And it easily trumps all other versions. (though the 92 version is well worth the watch, as is the Bella Lugosi film)Max Schreck plays the role of Count Dracula, he will always be the alpha and omega when it comes to playing Dracula, one look at him and you know he's the perfect fit.Nosferatu is a silent film, though there is some excellent background noise to accompany the film, the acting is good all around, and I imagine acting in a silent film is no easy task. While as can expected the film isn't jumpy, and it's a tad slow, it still has some excellent scenes for a horror film. Not to mention a few different ideas to the vampire legend that I haven't seen used in any other vampire film.It' a must see, even now in 2014</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nosferatu: Why hasn't everyone seen this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSNosferatu starts out by introducing us to a young couple in a port town of 19th century Germany. Ellen and Hutter are madly in love, and we feel the warmth and passion between them. Hutter has a well-paying job, albeit with a strangely terrifying boss. He's a sort of real estate agent and is sent off to the Carpathians to seal a deal with a one Count Orlak. He completes the transaction, but at the cost of his health. Once recovered, Hutter races back to his home town to get there before the suspicious Count Orlak. Count Orlak, meanwhile, with a strange fascination for Hutter's fianc, Ellen, sails for the port town. Count Orlak slaughters the entire crew of the ship but is still able to arrive safely to Wisborg and brings with him the plague. Count Orlak, losing interest in the real estate, decides to pursue Ellen. Hutter is unable to arrive in time, and it is only through Ellen's sacrifice that the town is ultimately freed from the outbreak and Count Orlak's rampage. This film has a huge fascination. It's basically the first Vampire film - a legend with roots as old as they come. The film itself has its own mystique too. It was said to be a copy of Bram Stoker's "Dracula" and thus banned and most copies burned. It's lead actor had the name Max Schreck, which could be translated to Extreme Terror. This person wasn't merely a phantom, as "Shadow of the Vampire" (2000) suggests. The film simply uses wonderful German Expressionist techniques to tell a fascinating story in a subtly and slightly new way. These shadows and geometric lines of expressionism help to accentuate the terror of an agent of the devil. His long fingers and closer resemblance to a rat than a bat, make Count Orlak appear as a truly ghastly Bsewicht. The real genius is just the simplicity of the tale, as all good movies will need a good script. The landscapes and fright scenes, with closeups and tricks of light are all that is needed to accentuate the plot. It is thus all the better for a novice to silent films who may be used to the exposition of talkies. We know who the bad guy is and what the good guy is trying to do; the film relies on its visual aesthetic. It's inspiring to think that a film approaching 100 years old can still live up to its name - a symphony of terror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a must see for all horror buffs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this one a few times but now that it is out on Blu Ray it is finally out full uncut. Don't get me wrong. The full uncut doesn't mean that gore was left out in other versions because there isn't any which is normal for a flick from that era but the flick had a few problems when it was released in 1922.But first before watching this cult classic you have to know something about F. W. Murnau, the director. He was chosen because he had an occult background. The producer Albin Grau was an occultist and both added some occult to spot throughout this flick. Just watch the symbols on the papers which were filled with Enochian, hermetic and alchemical symbols. Or the use of shadows to be believed that they brought you to another dimension. In fact, they made a company alive Prana to bring out this rip-off of Bram Stoker's Dracula. Although the critics adored this flick it became a big failure at the box office and resulted in bankruptcy. The reason was that no money came in but that the wife of Stoker sued Prana for using the script of Dracula as base of Nosferatu. It resulted in the fact that all copies had to be destroyed in which they did but luckily for us, some copies were already out of Germany in private hands but not all in good shape. So different version popped up after years until a few years ago when they discovered scene's on a French film. They restored the flick in full glory with the original soundtrack and German intertitles, upscaled in 1080p and 5.1 score and I must say, it looks great.The flick itself is a bit slow in some parts but is still worth watching to see the effects used. Back then it wasn't that easy to do editing effects but they did and it works out fine. Just watch Nosferatu coming out of his grave. It still looks eery. It's not only the atmosphere that makes it a classic but also the performance by Max Schreck. Rumours wer all around that in real life Max was a vampire. A classic and a must see for all horror buffs.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Germany based estate agent Knock dispatches Hutter, to Count Orlok's castle in Transylvania as the Count wants to purchase a isolated house somewhere else. Hutter's trek is an unusual one, with locals not wanting to take him near the castle where strange events have been occurring. Once at the castle, Hutter does manage to sell the Count a house, but he also notices and feels strange occurrences. Hutter eventually sees the Count's sleeping chamber in a crypt, and based on a book he has recently read, believes he is really a vampire....There have been many different incarnations of the Dracula character. Some very faithful, The Hammer version, Coppollas epic, the Frank Langella one, and of course Lugosi, all stand out as very impressive retellings of the story. But for all their impressive tricks and twists on the yarns, none of them are scary.So its ironic then that the version that had the Stoker clan up in arms, is the most haunting, and visually terrifying version you may ever see.Yes, the acting, especially Hutter leaves a lot to be desired, but Murnaus eye is wonderful, and Schreck is still the most freakish version of the count. Even though his screen time is little over nine minutes, he makes a real impact.If you prefer your vampires ala Jackmans Van Helsing, or Dracula 2000, stay away, you won't like it.An amazing feat, and watch Shadow Of The Vampire straight after, just to make it that little more freaky.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another film classic I really like; I remember seeing this literally for the first time at PLU (Pacific Lutheran Univercity) on a big screen at Olson Auditorium which is the concert hall. We watched the film while someone played the organ music to correspond with the scenes in the film. I'll admit it was a fun experience since it was one of those community gatherings in October. But also Dracula is one of my favorite fictional foes/monsters and I've seen several versions of Dracula before, my favorite the Francis Ford Copila version in my book but this film has a special place in my heart because it was the first (or one of if any other lost versions of Dracula are found)shot in bringing Dracula to the visual medium.There's not a whole lot I can really say about this film, it's pretty straight forward vampire film but done right. The orchastratic score that goes with it is great and fits with the grim dark atmosphere the film has. However it's the visuals in this film are just stunning and to me are what really have made it a classic.Of course the monster in the film Count Orlok is the star of the film and not hard to see why. That face of his truly is creepy and menacing, the make up work was really impressive and holds up to this day. This vampire is basically a humanoid bat creature, those eyes which look as though they could stare into your soul, pale white skin, big ears, sharp rat teeth, long fingers and nails, and the height of him which almost made him look like a giant. This character was simply a heartless beast whose goal was just to simply suck blood where ever and who ever he can find it. The way this character moves is also creepy because of how strange and varied the speed is, almost like some figure from your nightmares.But I feel the other star is simply the shadowy enviorment and the shadows that are always around Orlok. They really create a nightmarish dreamlike atmosphere my favorite enviorment set peace was no surprise Orlok's Castle which had all of the best places for shadows, and the look of it was simply menacing, creepy, gritty, which perfectly reflected Orlok's psyche. But also reinforce Orlock as a force of evil, the way he casts his shadow it is constantly growing tall and spreading trying to block out the light completely like a plague trying to spread. This of course gives some memorable visuals like my favorite one of Orlok creeping up the stairs toward a room, or his shadow creeping closer toward someone's bed.Well there's really nothing more to say, except beware of the shadows.Rating: 4 stars</fullReview>

And the nitrate tinting, that really does change the mood of the shot/scene. i guess it was a cool experience going to see a silent movie with a live band, but a slightly better movie would have been preferable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A work of pure expressionism and eeriness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am faced with one of my greatest challenges when reviewing a classic and it doesn't get any easier; trying to say something new about a film most everyone has seen and everyone has already formed an incorruptible opinion on. Oh, what to say. Nosferatu is a perfect horror film in every sense. It transports us back to a simpler time in cinema, when jump scares weren't the main concern, but atmosphere and tonal consistency. Where performances still mattered, and weren't reduced to archetypal characters and stereotypes.Nosferatu was the only production from the company Prana Films in 1921, and despite not having the rights to Bram Stroker's novel, Dracula, ambitious writer Henrik Galeen was given the assignment and pursued the challenge in adapting his story to film. With legendary director F.W. Murnau behind the camera, as well, the project was shaping out to be a fascinating and unique look on the vampire himself. It was shaping out to be perfect, until Stoker's widow, Florence Stoker, denied the rights to her deceased husband's work for unknown reasons. With a few minor changes, Murnau pushed on and made the film, but when Stoker sued, initially, the punishment was to have every copy of the film destroyed. While that clearly wasn't enforced to the fullest degree, it is unknown if the version available today is the original cut. Some reports have the film running at a runtime ten to fifteen minutes longer than the cut commercially available today, however, no official evidence has proved that the cut we possess today is censored or not.There's almost no reason to reiterate the story of the film seeing as it's pretty much the story of Dracula, which almost everybody knows. The American cut of the film even refers to Count Orlok as "Count Dracula," so the secrecy is corrupt. Let's focus on the film itself. First off, one can not deny that this is one of the finest horror films ever made. The technicalities behind the film are primitive, raw, and undeniably authentic. It was shot with only one camera, incorporates some very unstable editing, utilizes grainy film stock, and as a whole, is crafted extremely simplistically. This is not criticism, but observationist recollections of the picture as a whole. I'd personally much rather have all of those things than very glossy, pitch-perfect horror production. The primitive nature of the film is a breath of fresh air in a world where everything has to be so painstakingly perfect all the time.Nosferatu, himself, is played by Max Schreck, in arguably one of the greatest roles ever in a horror film. Schreck's character is tall, lanky, with large, bulging, unblinking eyes, equipped with a large, boxy nose, an unmoved expression always on his face, and stiff and unmovable torso. His first appearance on screen is jolting and brings a shiver to even the most experienced horror moviegoer. Schreck immerses himself into this role, making his vampire character not a character aware of implausibility but one, by the end, you believe could actually be real.I mentioned the use of film noir, as well. This is a recurring aspect for the film itself, mainly because it is so frequently and professionally used. The iconic "stair scene" where you see Nosferatu eerily walk up the stairs in shadow is a work of Gothic genius, and has become a staple of film noir in the horror genre. Not to mention, so has the delightfully creepy scene of Nosferatu ominously rising from his coffin and staring directly at the viewer. It is film technique like that that is truly invaluable.Starring: Max Schreck, Gustav von Wangenheim, Greta Schrder, Alexander Granach, Ruth Landshoff, and Wolfgang Heinz. Directed by: F.W. Murnau.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very beautiful, and often underrated film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most famous films of all time, the oldest surviving vampire film in the world, his director's most famous work, one of greatest and best known films of German Expressionism, and without question, one of the best horror films ever made and which set the standards for all the vampire films that have been made ever since. I know that many people are immediately put off by the fact that it is a silent film, but I would ask them to put that prejudice aside for ninety-three minutes, and give it a try. They eventually may not like it still, but still they got nothing to lose. In order to watch "Nosferatu" with a keen eye and to appreciate it in full as it deserves, some previous research is essential. Yes, it is an adaptation of the novel "Dracula", and as to why the names both geographical as well as the characters' are German in some editions, the answer is that Murnau and his producer didn't acquire the copyrights of the novel for purely financial reasons, and they thought they could make a pirate adaptation and get away with it. They did the first thing, but didn't achieve the second, for Bram Stoker's widow sued for plagiarism when she heard of the existence of "Nosferatu", and the court ordered all the existing copies to be destroyed without question. Fortunately a few survived, and by the Thirties, after the death of Mrs. Stoker, the ban ceased to be and the film could be publicly screened again. But the copies shown to the public had been chopped down to sixty-five minutes, leaving a film filled with massive plot holes and discontinuity that weighted it down terribly and caused the negative feelings that many spectators still feel about it. I myself experienced that when I acquired a VHS copy recorded from some TV channel, with English subtitles translated into Spanish by a voice-over, in plain black and white with lots of dirt spots in the negative and a murderous visual quality. Still, that was the only way to watch it before the arrival of DVD technology. Then ten years ago I attended a screening at the Curzon Soho cinema on the 80th anniversary of the film, and there I saw the restored "Nosferatu" for the first time, noticing the immense difference that the original 93 minutes make to the film. Not only everything makes now much more sense, but we can see that, except for minor changes in the action, the film is one of the most faithful adaptations of Stoker's novel. To me personally it also is, with Terence Fisher's "Dracula" of 1958, the best adaptation ever made to this day. Still, viewers ought to be aware that there are several different editions on sale on DVD, with prices varying between five pounds and twenty, and not all of them are the restored version. Obviously, the cheaper ones are just copies of the old VHS, so here we go back to the same problem we used to have in the past. The reason for this is that "Nosferatu" nowadays belongs to the public domain, which means anyone can edit a copy and put it for sale without infringing any original copyrights. This is what a few video companies just have done, recycling the old material they already had, regardless to quality and to the fact that they are selling only two-thirds of the film. Other editions bring the full-length cut, but still they present other deficiencies such as plain black and white cinematography -the original negative by Murnau was tinted- and the wrong soundtrack. I watched one of those versions once, which had an electronic score with vocal sounds in the background that would be more typical of modern slasher films and sounded absolutely terrible in "Nosferatu". To my knowledge, the only version to watch for someone who is looking for the real thing and wants to own a piece of film history, is the one available in the "Masters of Cinema" series, restored by the F.W.Murnau-Stiftung foundation and the film scholar Luciano Berriatua. It comes with the original tinted print, the original 1922 score and the original inter-titles design, as well as a long documentary on Murnau and a book that analyses the film thoroughly. It is not cheap, certainly, but it is the definitive "Nosferatu" DVD if you love the film like I do. For first-time viewers who want to have a go at it, I would suggest to watch it in the Internet first. But again, avoid any version under 90 minutes if you want to see the real film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iconic horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amazing horror film - iconic images from this film have echoed down the years. The image of Orlok's shadow cast on a wall as he climbed the stairs, Orlok rising out of his coffin, and the shot of Orlok carrying his coffin walking through Bremen are iconic images which many moviewatchers have seen even if they don't know where they come from.The movie was called Nosferatu because Bram Stoker's widow wouldn't grant permission for the use of her deceased husband's book and so director F.W. Murnau changed Dracula's name to Orlock (Max Schreck), he made Van Helsing into Professor and set the film in Bremen rather than London. That said, the outlines of the movie are similar apart from those simple name changes.This is a scary movie - from the creepiness of Orlock to the eeriness of real-estate agent Knock (Alexander Granach) to the impressive cross-cutting of Hutter's (Gustav von Wangenheim) suffering at the hands of Orlok to his wife Ellen (Greta Schroeder) empathizing and sensing his suffering. It is full of moments which will creep you out. Some of the acting is a bit hammy, but the essential story as told by Murnau and writer Henry Galeen is creepy and Murnau paces the film deftly. Truly a classic which will stay with you forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes this is an old film and the actual dialog script is probably about 2 pages. But this film does things to make it a piece of art. The music really shows the different scenes and what is going on. Also the color lens they use to show a moment. Like happiness or daylight was yellow but evil or darkness was blue. There was a strange moment when red was used too. Again there is no sound of voices, but some of the acting was pretty good. A lot of it seems cheesy from the time it was made, but two characters to me really stick out. Of course the first is Max Schreck as Nosferatu and then the other is Alexander Granach as Knock. Two really really boggled my mind about this film. There was a shot of a ship in water and it was a great shot. There are low budget movies now a days that use CG ships and it looks horrible, yet this 1920s film went all out. The other thing is the vampire. How scary is he? I mean look at how deformed he looks. There are some vampire movies that have more deformed vampires, but then look at others. Like Twilight. Vampires are meant to be scary and Hosferatu is one freaky looking vampire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film which really deserves the reputation it has achieved over the years.The earliest adaptation of the Dracula story to still survive, this movie has such power that lots of the conventions and characteristics of vampires accepted today were actually set up this film and not from the novel which spawned it, the aversion to sunlight being one.Aside from the character name changes this is a fairly faithful adaption of the novel. The most memorable character is of course Count Orlok, played to perfection by Max Schreck. He really personifies the pestilence he carries in his wake and makes the viewers skin crawl with his staring eyes, long clawlike hands and ratlike appearance. Also particularly striking is Knock the estate agent who, even before he became Orlok's servant, looked completely deranged. Hutter's wife is memorable for her terrible acting but then at this point in history, film was still a fairly new medium, so this can be forgiven.The filming locations are stunning and fit the mood perfectly and it is extraordinary to think that today ninety years later most of these locations remain unchanged.The version I watched had sepia tinting throughout and I'm not sure who wrote or performed the soundtrack, although it sounded like it was played on synthesisers with cellos as well. The DVDS was released by Eureka videos, so maybe for some readers this will clarify which soundtrack it was. Although it was a little out of place in some of the sequences especially towards the end, for the most part it fitted in well. Having said that, I, like most viewers, would have liked to have heard the original, but since this is now lost, it wasn't to be.This is a major piece of motion picture history and simply must be viewed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nosferatu: A symphony of horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I made this short review for school English class but I might just as well post it here.F.W Murnau's 1922 silent horror film Nosferatu is a true master piece and one of the biggest horror classics ever. It is also the oldest surviving movie adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula although the names of the characters in the movie were changed due to copyright reasons. Nosferatu was actually considered lost for a long time because Prana Studios who distributed the film got sewed by Bram Stoker's widow and were ordered to destroy every copy of the film and it was thought that no copy of the film had survived. Luckily that was not the case and horror fans can still enjoy this cinematic master piece. The film tells the basic story of "Dracula" (a Transylvanian vampire buys a house from England...) but makes slight changes to the story and actually changes the way Dracula (or "Count Orlac" as the vampire is called in the film) is killed since in the Bram Stoker novel he is simply stabbed but Nosferatu invents an entirely knew and innovative weapon "sunlight". Its funny that what is considered to be one of the most well know facts about vampires and is a huge part of the modern vampire mythology is actually not from the Dracula novel but from the film adaptation. Being the original Dracula film Nosferatu is a must see and an essential film for every horror fan's movie collection. Watch it if you dare!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bit of a landmark movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generally, I think recent movies are better than old movies. Most people who review these movies seem to disagree, as old movies tend to get higher ratings than modern movies. I watch a lot of movies - roughly about one a day - and I like watching old movies. I find old movies fascinating in the same way that I like to see how music has changed. But new movies are much more able to evoke emotions than old movies, though admittedly there's a lot of rubbish around. The picture quality now tends to be better, and the cinematography more advanced. Jaws, for instance, is so frightening because it matches what we do in our minds to frighten ourselves, and old movies generally fail to do this. Further, modern acting tends to be better and the scripts better - movies are now all-round more professionally done. Try watching the old and new versions of "3:10 to Yuma", end to end, if you disagree with what I say. That said, Nosferatu I think is really quite a good movie, well advanced of most other movies I've seen of the period - bit of a landmark in movie making, I'd say. It might be a bit clunky in scene changes &amp; in other ways, but I think it's truly a bit chilling, which most horrors, including many modern horrors, fail to achieve.Try following this movie up by watching John Malkovich's &amp; Willem Defoe's Shadow of the Vampire. It made me doubt my own view of reality, briefly. (I like films that do that - that make me think differently, if only for a while).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This unauthorized silent production of Bram Stoker's novel "Dracula" may not be the most faithful film version but it is truly the most haunting and provocative interpretation to this date. For its time "Nosferatu" is a masterful visual experience, most remembered for its boat scene in which Nosferatu rises from his crate and stalks along the deck of the ship. Although Max Scheck in the title role steals every scene he creeps into, everyone in the film puts on unforgettable performances. For those of you who are unsure about watching Nosferatu because it is a silent film, viewing it is an emotional, dreamlike experience. It's similar to the experience of a ballet where you feel the energy and emotion through the music, and the players, not through direct word. Over the years, "Nosferatu" has reached out with his long, boney, shadowy fingers and influenced everything from the horror/fantasy genre to Hollywood Blockbusters to even family movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an incredible film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>excerpt, full review at my location.Despite being released 90 years ago, Nosferatu remains one of the most iconic and infamous horror films of all time. Back in 1922, critics described Nosferatu as a masterpiece and it continues to find new audiences with every passing year. It has been remade, parodied and even gained its own mythos with Shadow Of The Vampire. So what, exactly, makes this movie stand the test of time?As with many silent era classics, the whole movie is now available to enjoy on YouTube, without committing an act of piracy since Nosferatu is now a public domain film. There are also countless (excuse the pun!) versions and restorations available, some of which even have new inter- titles which have changed the characters names to Dracula and Harker. So really, it has never been easier to see this incredible film ? a film which changed the vampire legend and shaped the future of horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Uniquely Mesmerizing and Nightmarish Classic of All Classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are great films, there are masterpieces, and then there are a bunch of films that simply MUST be seen by anybody even remotely interested in the art of cinema, and "Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens" doubtlessly belongs in the latter category. Not only is F.W. Murnau's 1922 German Expressionist silent adaptation of the Dracula story the scariest and most atmospheric filmic version of Bram Stoker's novel, it is doubtlessly one of the most atmospheric films of all-time, and arguably even THE most influential Horror film ever made. The iconic status of "Nosferatu" is almost unequaled. The picture of Max Schreck in his immortal role of Count Orlock has long become a synonym for the Horror genre.But "Nosferatu" is not simply a must-see for being such an important classic. To this day, it is simply one of the creepiest masterpieces ever accomplished, thanks both to F.W. Murnau's magnificent atmospheric genius and the uniquely haunting screen presence of Max Schreck (whose name oddly translates "Max Fright"). I am a huge admirer of both Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee, and I love both of them in their roles of Count Dracula, but neither man's eeriness (nor that of any other screen Dracula) comes close to the nightmarish power of Max Schreck's demonic stare, which infests any viewer of this film. This is what nightmares are made of.The unspeakable gloom of "Noferatu" is created by almost all aspects of the film. The wonderful settings simply ooze atmosphere, and the grainy picture of the early 20s film suggests the weird impression of actually being filmed in an old and mysterious time. Since the storyline of "Dracula", which "Nosferatu is based on, is generally known, I don't suppose it necessary to give a plot description of this film. Angered by the fact that her permission was not asked Bram Stoker's widow Florence Stoker tried to get the film confiscated and the copies destroyed, and this Classic of all Horror Classics therefore owes its survival to lucky coincidences. Very lucky, that is, as "Nosferatu" is doubtlessly one of the most precious pieces of art that cinema has ever brought forth. There are not enough words for me to appropriately praise "Nosferatu". The film simply is brilliant in every detail. The cinematography, the settings, Max Schreck... every aspect of "Nosferatu" is part of creating an incomparable atmosphere of pure gloom. As said above, this film simply MUST be seen by everyone even remotely interested in film. I strongly suggest to get a good copy featuring the original Soundtrack on DVD. Absolutely essential! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irrational Fear Of The Unknown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An historically significant silent film, "Nosferatu" conveys B&amp;W images of what in the early twentieth century symbolized evil: a solitary, hideous looking man with an unhealthy interest in human blood, who "sleeps" in the daytime, and comes out at night. In the early 1920s this was probably a very scary film ... not so much today.In the DVD copy that I watched, there is no "Graf Orlok", "Hutter", or "Knock". These names have been replaced by "Nosferatu", "Johnathon Harker", and "Renfield", respectively. Further, the plot doesn't make a whole lot of sense. And my impression is that some scenes have been excised.The plot takes place in 1838. Harker travels to Nosferatu's castle to get him to return to Bremen. Harker's journeys are via land. Nosferatu travels by sea. Their routes are conspicuously different. Further, I'm not clear on why Harker's physical presence at the castle is needed for Nosferatu to initiate a trip to Bremen. After all, Nosferatu corresponded with Renfield, in Bremen, by letter. But again, there may have been scenes that explained these apparent discrepancies that were for some reason cut out.For this film to have been popular with 1920s audiences, vampirism must have resonated with people in that era, despite the 1838 setting. Yet, Einstein's theory of relativity was already fully developed by 1915. Science, it would seem, is no match for an irrational fear of the unknown. Very little seems to have changed through the years.I'm constantly amazed at how shabby the clothes were in this film, and the bleak production design. Science and technology have greatly improved both. And humanity is better off as a result.For historical perspective, "Nosferatu" is worth watching, I guess. It's slow paced. Acting is about what you would expect for the silent era. Just be aware that some names may be different. And the plot may not conform to logic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nosferatu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nosferatu was not my kind of film. There was no sound or music at all. I am spoiled by the horror films today. This film was very slow and symbolic of World War Two. I was expecting a really cool kind of Dracula film and was disappointed. It was Dracula just not anything like my expectations. I would definitely not see this film again. I would not ever recommend this film to anyone either. I hate to be no negative and pessimistic in this review but I cannot help the way I feel about it. It seemed to just drag on and on and never really went any where for me. I kept zoning out. It did not hold my attention or keep my interest. It had a very sad not a feel good ending when the girl dies and the man is left alone. The only thing we had to go by was a few flash cards and it wasn't enough to keep me on top of everything that I was seeing. It was very boring to me and then with the sad ending I just didn't leave the room in a very happy mood. It was kind of quite depressing actually. This monster thing just goes around destroying and killing just about everything in its path. I am sure that I am just used to all the technologies of today and that is why I do not have very much appreciation for this film but I cannot help the era in which I was born and when this film was produced. Maybe if someone today redid it I would find it a lot more interesting and possibly even find it a great movie. You know someone should redo this old classic film. It would be very interesting to see what someone could come up with.</fullReview>

What is interesting to know is that this movie was actually mean't to be a movie adaptation of the classic Dracula novel, but the couldn't get the copyrights to the novel so the change the name of every one, but kept the same storyline. The only problem with a silent movie is that I can't critic the music. Even though It has music on the DVD it was all added in by the computer. Well the version I saw had good music. Another thing about silent films is that you can't really say any thing about the acting. So lets just say that the faces match the emotions. So overall this is one great vampire film and I diffidently recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wonder what it would have been like seeing this in a theater in 1922. Maybe with a date? Would you have had nightmares for weeks? Would she have? I think the answer would have been a resounding YES! Silent film or not, Nosferatu will bring chills up and down your spine. The performance of Max Schreck reveals his attention to detail as one of the original method actors.The movie opens on a town bathed in sepia tones coupled with flute-like sounds wrapped in semi-upbeat music. This is Ellen and Hutter's hopeful theme. Hutter presents his beautiful wife with freshly picked flowers upon her asking "why did he kill them"? We are faced almost immediately with foreshadowing of what's to come. Sepia tones continue with Knock proposing to Hutter the idea of "making a pretty penny" with selling the house across the street.As Hutter gets ready to travel to meet Count Orlock, Ellen's face at the doorway is filled with concern, and then they embrace with a kiss. The film then alternates between blue and sepia hues upon his journey, with a showing of dogs on the path. The joy and innocence exuding from Butter's face reminds me of Begnini's spirit throughout the 1997 movie "Life is Beautiful." The ending share similar qualities, too.The music changes to deeply ominous, foreboding tones of the didgeridoo, coupled with intermittent dissonant long tones. Then the original melody is sped up to signify the impending nighttime when "unnatural deeds" occur. After Butter crosses the bridge into the pass, he is met by a carriage driven by a character emulating Count Orlock. The horses are even shrouded to cover their hideous sights. Then Butter meets up with Count Orlock who tells him that it is late and his "servants are asleep." There is even a reddish scene. .....wonder what this means for later.End of Act 1.So much about this movie screams MASTERPIECE! Sound, lighting, color, makeup, thematic melodies, graininess of the film, and acting. I haven't seen enough silent films to compare, but for me Nosferatu hit all the right chords, figuratively and literally. The only complaint, and it's very superficial, is that the music had similar qualities of the synthesized tones from the early computer video game "King's Quest," oddly enough. This experience has made me appreciate silent films more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nosferatu still has bite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally managed to upload a copy of the classic German film Nosferatu (1922) intending to review it along with other horror and Halloween-themed movies and TV this October. Among those interested in vampires, Nosferatu has a towering reputation. The movie also established that daylight kills vampires. Nosferatu is basically a rip-off of the novel Dracula, with the names changed. However, I watched an English language version where the names from the novel were restored- for example, Count Orlok was called Count Dracula in the version I watched. Hence I will use the names from the novel in this review.Being from 1922, Nosferatu is of course a silent film; I believe this is only the second silent film I've seen after Birth of a Nation (1915). Despite the handicap of being mute, silent films can convey an effective message anyway. I knew just from watching the beginning that Renfield was crazy and had a creepy laugh. Furthermore, when Renfield sends Harker to Dracula's castle, you can see Harker, formerly a sceptic regarding warnings from the superstitious peasants, beginning to freak out. The appearance of Dracula is now famous- a rotting corpse, not a man. People praise the actor, Max Schreck, but personally I see this as more of a triumph in make-up than in acting.I found myself not understanding a few things in the movie- like how Dracula got control of Renfield to begin with. Another disappointment is that with a run time of only an hour and twenty-four minutes, and with Dracula not getting to Germany until fifty-seven minutes into the film, he's not going to be able to do much there. We see little of his terrorizing of Germany, until a strategy to kill him is conveniently found in a book, and he's vapourized by the morning sun. Still, Nosferatu is a landmark in vampire history, marking the start of their long lived presence in movies. It's still a fun film, and still an influence.Happy Halloween.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Silent Horror Vampire Epic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>F.W. Murnau's silent 1922 chiller "Nosferatu, a Symphony of Horror" ranks as the earliest vampire epic. As many as twenty vampire movies, some of them short films, had been produced before the release of Murnau's landmark epic. Unfortunately, none of these earlier vampire films survived. Ostensibly, "Golem" scenarist Henrik Galeen and Murnau appropriated Bram Stoker's celebrated 1897 novel "Dracula" as the basis for their plot, but they neglected to obtain copyright clearance from Stoker estate. Inevitably, Stoker's widow Florence sued Murnau and the company, won the case in court, and demanded that the authorities confiscate and destroy every print and negative of "Nosferatu." Happily, "Nosferatu" survived this court order, and audiences can enjoy it today. Not only does "Nosferatu" qualify as the first "Dracula" adaptation, but it also is a touchstone picture in the vampire genre because its vampire, Court Orlok, appeared emaciated and ugly. He looked nothing like either Bela Lugosi or Christopher Lee embodied. Max Schreck portrayed Court Orlok as a hideously ugly vampire. He sports needle type fangs in the front of his mouth, and he looks like a concentration camp inmate."Nosferatu" isn't a slavish adaptation of "Dracula." Apparently, Galeen and Murnau tried to skirt the copyright issue by altering the setting, changing several names, and marginalizing certain characters. Nevertheless, despite these revisions, the court ruled in favor of Florence Stoker. Basically, the plot remains intact. One major departure involves Professor Van Helsing. Usually, Van Helsing acts as Dracula's arch enemy. Galeen and Murnau have reduced his role here to providing exposition about parasitic vampire organisms. Furthermore, the Murnau film takes place in Germany in 1838 whereas the Stoker novel occurred in the 1890s. Interestingly, unlike Dracula, Orlok does not create other vampires with his bite. He kills them as the plague serves as a metaphor of his evil. One precedent that "Nosferatu" established was that vampires were susceptible to sunlight. Meaning, they could be killed by the sun, something that wasn't the case with Stoker's literary protagonist who would stroll around during the day, though his powers were considerably attenuated. Meanwhile, enough similarities existed to seal the fate of the filmmakers. In Bremen, Germany, a strange real estate agent named Knock dispatches Thomas Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim), to travel to distant Transylvania in the Carpathian Mountains to transact a business deal with the Count. In Stoker's novel, the Hutter character was named Jonathan. Anyway, Thomas is a rather adolescent, happy-go-luck character. He dismisses the warnings of the local folk as superstitious nonsense. He discovers a book, The Book of the Vampires, left in his room and casts it aside in contempt. Presumably, the local equivalent of the Gideons put this book in every wayfarer's room as a sort of admonition. An eerie moment occurs when the coachmen takes Hutter to a bridge and leave him afoot because he refuses to cross over into the province of phantoms. Later, a sinister coach drawn by horses decked out in hoods arrives with a creepy looking driver. Hutter climbs aboard for a whirlwind ride to the foreboding castle where the nobleman awaits him. The Count (Max Schreck) wants to pull up stakes in "Nosferatu" and relocate in Bremen. Indeed, the two eponymous vampires forsake their homeland and embark on a voyage to another city.Before the Count departs, he attacks Hutter and leaves him for dead. Meanwhile, the Count loads six coffins onto a wagon, clambers into the topmost coffin, levitates the lid onto it and sets the horses in motion for the harbor. This "Dracula" is very supernaturally endowed. Moreover, not only can Count Orlok control things nearby, but he can also control things at a great distance and has acquired power over Hutter's employer Knock. Eventually, Knock goes insane and he is put in a strait-jacket and placed in a psychiatric asylum. In the Stoker novel, the character of Knock was named Renfield.During the voyage, both Dracula and Orlok assume command of their vessels. In "Nosferatu," the outbreak of the plague is associated with the rats that infest Orlok's coffins. Everybody dies on the respective ships. The Count arrives in the ship at Wisborg with nobody left alive, but the ship is teeming with rats carrying a plague that wrecks havoc. German officials examine the ship, read the captain's log and fear the worst: plague. Before long, panic grips the public about the plague and people start to die. The scenes where town officials mark front doors looks almost Biblical. Meanwhile, Hutter escapes from Orlok's castle and nearby peasants nurse him back to health. By now, Orlok has killed everybody on the ship. Orlok is entranced by Hutter's girl and he takes a dilapidated building across the street from Hutter's house. While all of this is going on, Ellen has developed a psychic connection with Nosferatu. She will exert her power, but in the process she will die as she lures the undead villain to dally in her room until the morning rays of sunlight penetrate his body and he disappears.Although many critics tried to pigeonhole Murnau in with the German Expressionist movement, he was not entirely given over to expressionism. For instance, Expressionists prefer to shoot inside the orderly confines of a studio, whereas Murnau took his cameras onto location to shoot some scenic footage for the film. Watch closely and you will see that Schreck rarely blinks. "Nosferatu" emerges as one of the greatest horror films, and Schreck's performance as the "Dracula" vampire is without parallel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite simply, the finest horror film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It wasn't the very first horror film and it may not even have been the first vampire film (I read somewhere once of one called Der Vampyr, made in 1919 which is now lost) but this one sets the standard. From the very beginning, Murnau uses light, darkness and shadow to full effect, creating a foreboding sense of unease that has never been equalled. Comparisons between Alien and Nosferatu are obvious - decrepit, dank, nasty sets stalked by a monster that remains unseen and, once it appears, proves to be weirdly unhuman. Of course, parts are dated; this was made in 1922, so we must expect as much. However, this film is in no way an anachronistic period piece or a curiosity - it still has the power to frighten and Orlock is still the most terrifying of celluloid vampires. Thank God Bram Stoker's widow and estate were unsuccessful in destroying all copies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Noseferatu Started It All!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Noseferatu" is one chilling film, and a must-see for any lover of the horror genre. It really sets the stage for Hollywood's steady production of vampire-related tales for more than three generations. About the only negative thing about it is that director F. W. Murnau didn't ask for permission to adapt Bram Stoker's original 1897 novel to the screen, and a long legal battle developed with Stokers' widow. Murnau lost the case in 1925 ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Stoker) but prints luckily survived.Beginning with real estate agent Hutter going to Transyvania to secure the sale of a house in Germany to Count Orlock, Hutter soon finds that all is not normal in the life of the Count. Even the carriage ride to Orlock's castle is odd; Murnau chooses to speed up the film anytime said conveyance moves. The behaviour of local townspeople and, shortly after the carriage ride, Hutter's introduction to the Count, plunges us into a seriously dark world. And there is no less a discovery by Hutter of a book about vampires. There are a number of film-history moments in the early going, but one that I don't recall seeing in any other vampire film is Orlock's rise up from a seeming prostrate position. This not only startles Hutter but we as well. Any student of vampire lore (at least the popular image of it) will recognize the close parallel between Murnau's movie and subsequent films about Dracula. I grew up with the far more widely known Bela Lugosi rendition which in its own right is a fine film, another whose themes are widely copied. The actual quality of the film is a little suspect. I think we are fortunate the film is even available, and the slightly disjointed print is not so terrible as to make it less visually disturbing. There has been speculation about the star of Noseferatu (Max Schreck as Count Orlock) and its director F.W. Murnau for what seems like forever. I recall reading a story in a magazine during my teens that perpetuated the notion that Schreck was himself a vampire. This is a far remove from what really seems to be the case, that he merely a loner in his private life. Noseferatu is a four star movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monstrosity With Human Substrate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1853, the German philosopher Karl Rosenkranz wrote a standard work about "The Estetics of Ugliness". In his book, he also differentiated several types of ugliness which are normally perceived as horrific, f.ex. the nauseating, the criminal, the diabolical, the demonic type, the witch-type, the satanic type. He also suggested a comprehensive typology about the features which cause horror, such as horror by nature, horror by mind, artificial horror, and he even added a chapter about the pleasure of horror. Of course, Rosenkranz could not know that already two generations after him one would use the possibilities of film in order to combine his types or even to invent new ones.The reason why F.W. Murnau's "Nosferatu" is still being counted amongst the best 100, 50 or even 10 horror movies of all time, lies without doubt in the fact that Count Orlok is not an alien, but a human monstrosity who could have been found in one of the many deformation cabinets on the fairgrounds still at the beginning of the 20th century. He was possibly surpassed only by the Elephant Man who left, at least in the present author, a fright that would not go away soon when he saw that movie for the first time. Horror-types that are related to that of Count Orlok could also be found in the first "Ghost Trains" (or "Dark Rides") since the end of the 20ies. Only later, one would start to deviate from this Orlok-type of "horror by nature" which does not stand by chance at the top of Rosenkranz' list. Since we are part of nature, we seem to feel more intensely touched by monsters whose human part is still shining through, so to say. Even today, after having experienced a whole typology of monstrousness, we still feel creepier in watching Count Orlok than Freddie Krueger. The reason for all that lies possibly in the fact that the human brain is incapable of imagining a monster without any human substrate, and amongst these monsters with human substrate, the types of "horror by nature" are the most creepy ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing beats the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that the popular theme in Hollywood be it in film or television is the lure of the vampire. With shows like "True Blood" and the cult teen film like "Twilight" the obsession with vampires is growing. However, when talking about vampire film nothing beats the original vampire film Nosferatu.Nosferatu is based on Bram Stroker's "Dracula" and takes the horrifying novel and turns it into a terrifying film. This is the basis behind all vampire films and also even horror films in general. One of the most famous and interesting effects is the use of shadows.Most horror films play with the use of shadows which is most popularly introduced in Nosferatu the last scene when Count Orlok walks up the stairs and at first you see his shadow is one of the most popular scenes in this film and for good reason. The shadow in the stairwell is famous not only for aesthetic purposes but also it is a truly horrifying scene. By not seeing the monster you truly get the suspense given in a film, especially one that is silent.In recent horror films Hollywood has depended on a soundtrack to create the mood, but when we look back and watch good silent films like Nosferatu we can see how visually a film can be just as frightening as a Hollywood film with a soundtrack and sometimes the silent films can be even more petrifying. With the use of shadows and make-up Nosferatu is the classic vampire. Every vampire film or show has used some form of Nosferatu as a defining point and as a creative reference.It is good to look back at these classic films and see what makes them so archetypal. Nosferatu can even be described as the beginning of the horror genre. Through tense visual sequences and odd behavior of Orlok Nosferatu is captivating. This film is a must see for any film-goer, especially anyone interested in the lure of vampires.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phantom der Nacht</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A historian had questions about the origins of the plague that appeared in Wisborg (Bremen is the name of the city in the version of my DVD). He knew that somehow Thomas Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim) and Ellen Hutter (Greta Schrder) were an important part in both the beginning and the end. This couple of course is going to be the protagonists and the ones that will see everything in a different way. The journey begins for Thomas and he will be just interested on his mission no matter if a lot of people around don't want to get close to his destination, they are afraid of it. At this point the -relevant- book of the vampires (it is called like that in the version of my DVD) is even like a joke for Thomas. But he will feel the horror as Ellen. Graf Orlok (Max Schreck) arrives, the plague arrives, the death arrives. The place is full of fear, some persons carrying the coffins makes a terrific scene. Graf Orlok has many memorable scenes, the performance of Schreck is just unique but there are some scenes that are unforgettable: Graf Orlok on the ship, his shadow but damn he was reflected! I like a lot how this versions ends, the woman knew this: a woman pure in heart must make him forget the rooster's first crowing.The historical value of this film is enough to consider it a "must-see film". It has a difficult past, problems with the copyright and with Florence Stoker. But this one is a unique version, a great version. A lot of that is thanks to Schreck. Here everything relies in the atmosphere and of course in the presence. The vampire is not elegant, the vampire is everything else but that. We don't see more vampires, one is enough to bring the fear, the confusion, the desperation, the death?Essential for any film lover out there; some may find it just as a worth watching film due to its historical value. I'm not one of them. I just loved this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An unauthorized production of Bram Stoker's work (The legal heirs didn't give their permission), so the names had to be changed. But this wasn't enough: The widow of Bram Stoker won two lawsuits (1924 and 1929) in which she demanded the destruction of all copies of the movie, however happily copies of it were already too widespread to destroy them all. Later, the Universal studios could break her resistance against this movie. Count Orlok's move to Wisburg (Obviously the real "Wismar") brings the plague traceable to his dealings with the Realtor Thomas Hutter, and the Count's obsession with Hutter's wife, Ellen the only one with the power to end the evil.A classic film with silent acting and good gore, which is a classic here.Rated PG for Graphic Violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Grandfather of all vampire films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About 10 years after the death of Bram Stoker, a German filmmaker F. W. Murnau became interested in adapting Stoker's most famous novel, a vampire story "Dracula", as a motion picture. However, Stoker's family was not interested in selling the rights to film the book and legally the film should never have been done. Murnau did not give up but with a screenwriter Henrik Galeen made some changes to the story line and characters.Set in the 1830's Germany, a real-estate agent Thomas Hutter(Gustav von Wangenheim) receives a job from his boss Herr Knock(Alexander Granach) to travel to Transylvania and sell a house from their town to an eccentric nobleman Graf Orlok(Max Schreck). As Hutter travels through the Transylvanian countryside towards Graf Orlok's castle, the local villagers express unexplainable fear whenever hearing Hutter mentioning his destination or Orlok's name. Hutter receives a strange book from one of the villagers that tells about Nosferatu, an undead creature that sleeps in graves during daylight hours and feeds on the blood of the living people during the night. Refusing to believe in such stories Hutter continues to the castle of the vampire lord. Meanwhile back in Germany, Hutter's young wife Ellen(Greta Schrder) starts to sense something dreadful approaching.As a film Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (Nosferatu, a Symphony of Horror) is the grandfather of all vampire films. There are numerous elements in this film that have been passed to other vampire films and that can be found even in the very newest films. Such elements as vampire dying in sunlight, vampire's obsession of a young woman, local villagers living in fear, a young man accidentally cutting a wound to his finger and making vampire behave strangely, and many, many other things. This film also started the long lasting tradition in Dracula adaptations to cast the weakest actor in the movie in the role Harker, Hutter here. Unlike his many successors though, Gustav von Wangenheim is not a stone face bloke, but an annoyingly overacts his reactions throughout the film.Murnau, who in his most early films already showed a great love towards nature and surroundings, wanted to film on actual locations and he does an excellent work with his photographer Fritz Arno Wagner. The little town in the beginning delivers a kind of dream like atmosphere that turns into a nightmare later when vampire brings death and destruction with him. The majestic takes of Carpathian Mountains and Graf Orlok's castle have an eerie feeling around then, almost like from an another world. The castle with its doors opening and closing by themselves and bats flying around its towers has been an inspiration to many later Gothic castles in films.The most memorable aspect in the film however, is the vampire itself. The monstrous bald headed and long fingered Graf Orlok differs greatly from the Count Dracula of Stoker's novel, but not in a bad way. Orlok does not appear as just another version of Dracula but is a completely own character. Although Orlok seems like a monstrous missing link between a bat, a rat and a human, and only brings death and misery wherever he goes, he does have some tragic elements in him also, that the actor Max Schreck manages to subtly perform from under his makeup. Orlok is not the kind of vampire to appear to maiden's window and seduce her to drink her blood. He does not have any appeal or hypnotic powers in him. He has to take what he wants, for no one will give it to him voluntarily.Unlike in Stoker's book and many later adaptations of Dracula, the film is not build around the fight between vampire and the crew of men hunting him, but between a vampire and the woman he desires. Greta Schrder, though somewhat theatrical, makes a good performance as a woman who, in order to defend all the she holds dear for herself, must allow the devil to have what he wants. The finale in the film in many ways is actually more dramatic than that of Stoker's book. The film also has its own Van Helsing- type of character, Professor Bulwer(John Gottowt), but his role is so small in the film that he is not even necessary character here.All in all, even if the film may not seem much to the present day audience now, over 80 years after its production, it is still in many ways impressive to watch, not only as the first memorable Dracula adaptation, but also as maybe the most important vampire film ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No wonder it's a classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had reservations about watching Nosferatu. Since I love movies that make good use of sound, the idea of silent film didn't interest me. I had similar prejudices toward the special effects, cinematography, acting, etc. I figured Nosferatu was a classic for purely nostalgic reasons. I mean, how could anybody actually enjoy a movie that could have been shot by a seventeen-year-old with a crappy camera? How naive I was...Nosferatu is an exercise in brilliant film-making. Murnau's heavy investment on the look of the film pays off. The film is fun to watch. The acting is over the top, which is necessary to avoid constant cuts to dialog cards. The music is great, too. Chilling and expressive without being overbearing.As Roger Ebert put it, this film is not as scary as it is haunting. There are no moments that make you jump, but there are parts that stick in your head. Nosferatu is a classic for a reason. Find out for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A hugely important film, not only for the horror genre but also for cinema itself. I saw the film at a very young age and Max Schreck's performance haunted my dreams for the years to come. He is truly brilliant as Nosferatu, the vampire, a massively chilling performance. The influence of this film can be seen all around us and despite it's age it is still one of my favourite films. The music is extremely atmospheric and despite there being no actual sound (such as dialogue or sound effects) the story is easily good enough to allow the lack of sound not to matter. The story itself is compelling and the main character turns in a fairly good performance. It is even fairly amusing in places. The film is a classic and anyone who believes themselves a film buff must see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>creepiest show on earth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so disturbing on so many levels I don't know where to begin. While Bela Lugosi and his successors have portrayed Count Dracula as a noble, even charming gentleman, Max Schreck's Count Orlock is a hideously deformed monster without any redeeming qualities. There's an uncomfortable touch of racism here: Orlock is the "other," the foreigner, corrupting the blood of pure Aryan maidens. Perhaps the paranoia rampant in post-World War I Germany, a defeated country oppressed by the victors, partially explains this. But what's with the rats? Orlock is portrayed as lord of the rats, a carrier of plague, This is chilling when you consider that the Nazis often portrayed Jews as rats, particularly in the infamous propaganda film "The Eternal Jew." I don't know why Germans are obsessed with rats; perhaps they'd be a happier nation if they kept more cats. The bottom line is, this movie gives a disturbing glimpse into the German collective psyche, and goes a long way toward explaining how the Holocaust could have happened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surreal, chilling, and beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever you see something described as "instantly recognisable", beware: it means that whatever it is has been spoofed/homaged/ripped off so many times that the original isn't what you actually recognise. Half the people who recognise Max Schreck's terrifying Count Orlock haven't seen the film at all, but have seen plenty of clip shows, parodies, or worse, Buffy The Vampire Slayer. In effect, certainly in this case, "instantly recognisable" means that worthy source material has become synonymous with and indistinguishable from the clichs that have followed in its wake.That's why on first viewing Nosferatu is interesting for all the shots that Schreck isn't on screen. Thomas Hutter, Professor Bulwer?these are all new characters, presented fresh for audiences eighty-five years on. The shots of Orlock rising from his coffin, lurking in his crypt ? and, of course, coming up the stairs ? are fantastically exciting, but only when the rest of the story is added are these moments validated and a truly great film is made.Nosferatu was made a score of years after Bram Stoker wrote Dracula (in fact his widow was still alive), and the vampire it gave us is now such a ubiquitous trope that it's easy to forget how comparatively recent it was, and that Nosferatu comes from a period when the imagery surrounding it was still being defined. The film dates from when something new was being brought to the table with every retelling of the story, and this film's major contribution to the tale is the idea that sunlight is fatal to vampires. Since technical limitations meant that scenes could only be shot in bright sunlight, in retrospect they were lucky to get away with it.But it works. F. W. Murnau was the king of German Expressionism in silent cinema, and the abstract, surreal and symbolic style of film-making makes a virtue out of necessity. Hand-cranked cameras mean that people move strangely ? this is actually incorporated into the film here, to give characters a sense of grotesque distortion. Similarly the bright sunlight during what is supposed to be the middle of the night is used to give the feeling that time itself has been subverted in Orlock's realm, as the enigmatic figure disappears from one place and reappears in another without apparently travelling through the intervening space. All this contributes to Nosferatu's status as one of the most atmospheric and visually beautiful films of all time.Murnau died in 1931, around the time when silent films were being phased out in favour of talkies. This means that he will forever be associated with the style of cinema of which he was the undisputed master. He famously liked to use the visuals to tell the story, and to keep title cards to a minimum; as a consequence, the plot of Stoker's novel has been stripped to its bare bones. Once again however limitations and necessities are taken and turned into bonuses, as the plot here becomes a frame around the film. Expressionism was, after all, concerned with symbolism and suggestion rather than the purely literal, and it feels appropriate that the various milestones of the novel become mere points of reference here, starting places for it to divert away in its bizarre, frightening manner.These days, modern audiences find silent films increasingly difficult to get to grips with. It's understandable, but it's a shame. I haven't mentioned the poor quality of the film stock because it simply doesn't matter (in fact it adds to the evocative nature of the film by increasing the distorted effect), but common gripes don't end there. A common accusation is that silent films are badly acted, or that the comedies aren't funny. They are well acted?just in a different way. And they are funny?just in a different way. They follow a different set of rules. But I need make no such excuse for Nosferatu, which remains as scary (if not more so) than any horror film I've ever seen, while remaining a beautiful, intelligent, literate piece of cinema. So put aside your preconceptions, if you have any, and forget about the silly spoofs. Just enjoy a film that's almost perfect on every level of its conception.</fullReview>

Mongolia declares its independence from China. Adolf Hitler becomes chairman of the Nazi party. The first radio broadcast of a baseball game occurs from Pittsburgh. The first successful insulin treatment of diabetes is administered. The first issue of Reader's Digest is published.BIRTHS: Donna Reed, Eva Gabor, Cyd Charisse, Al Jaffee, Peter Ustinov, Prince Philip Duke of Edinburgh, John Glenn, Gene Roddenberry, Monty Hall, Deborah Kerr, Yves Montand, Charles Bronson, Rodney Dangerfield, Steve Allen, Telly Savales, Steven Hill, William Gaines. DEATHS: Bat Masterson, Pope Benedict XV.KEVIN: This movie wasn't that scary. In fact, I laughed quite a bit. Obviously, no one in this movie has ever seen a horror film, but that's probably because they haven't been invented yet. It was kind of hysterical when Hutter is all happy telling his wife, "I'm going to the country of thieves and ghosts! Isn't that wonderful?!" And he's reading that little book that tells him all about the Nosferatu, but he's just not getting it, even when Orlock is licking the blood off his thumb and telling him his wife has a pretty neck. This movie did have some impressive special effects for the day, like when Orlock is sort of fading in and out, and of course the iconic moment when he rises out of the coffin.DOUG: People have called this one of the scariest movies ever made. Maybe I missed something, but I didn't find it scary at all. The only part that I thought was really scary was the famous moment when Orlock rises up out of his coffin "as if on a hinge." The rest of the movie was just a little strange. The "hero" of the movie is Hutter, who annoyed me to no end with his ignorance and stupidity in the face of very obvious danger. I can forgive this fool for the fact that none of the really informative vampire films had been made yet, but this guy is just dense. He just couldn't wait to ship off to Transylvania to meet the Count. "Darling, I'm going to the country of thieves and ghosts! Isn't that wonderful?!" When he finds the book in the hotel about vampires and werewolves and stuff, he just yawns and tosses it aside. When he wakes up in Orlock's castle and finds the bite marks on his neck, he actually believes they're just mosquito bites. A lot of the title cards were strange, too; we had to keep pausing it because they weren't on screen long enough for us to read them with all the curvy letters. Another thing I wondered about is this business of Orlock seeming to have telekinetic powers, achieved with a sort of obvious stop-motion business. And I wondered, how hard could it be to use wires? It would be a little scarier for me.NOTE: We were shown this film in our History of Silent Film class. Reading about it and discussing it cleared up a lot of questions about the movie's popularity and legacy and why the characters behave the way they do. A big deal was made about Orlock's monstrous appearance, which was in stark contrast to the cunning, suave gentleman popular in later versions.Last film: The Kid (1921). Next film viewed: Our Hospitality (1923). Next film chronologically: Robin Hood (1922). The Movie Odyssey is an exhaustive, chronological project where we watch as many milestone films as possible, starting with D.W. Griffith's Intolerance in 1916 and working our way through, year by year, one film at a time. We also write a short review for each and every film. In this project, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the time period, the films of the era, and each film in context, while at the same time just watching a lot of great movies, most of which we never would have watched otherwise.</fullReview>

I mean, come on! How scary is Bela Lugosi or Frank Langella? Thank God Florence Stoker didn't get all copies of this masterpiece destroyed!

Nine points for having enough guts to be the first to make Dracula into a movie under a new title. The story isn't much different from Dracula as memory recalls and as mentioned above. Nosferatu has been rated number two or three on the scariest movies ever created list. The obvious number one is the Exorcist. If you ever get a chance, see this.

		<shortDescription>Murnau's masterpiece of menace and atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whilst there are a few solid versions of Dracula out there, F.W. Marnau's 1922 silent adaptation remains the greatest film adaptation of Bram Stoker's tale. Ironically, the film was unauthorised and was eagerly sought to be destroyed by Stoker's widow which makes its latter-day rediscovery and restoration all the more appreciable. Opting for a folkloric depiction of the vampire, the film presents one of the screen's most menacing figures, the hideous Count Orlok (Max Schreck), far removed from the suave urbanity of the succeeding incarnations that we have grown used to. The story is the same: a naive young estate agent ventures to Transylvania in order to secure the bloodthirsty aristocrat's move to his home town where strange happenings are occurring. Yet, what makes Nosferatu the definitive Dracula movie is its grandiose air of menace, atmosphere and fascination which few films ever have rivalled. For its time, the film is stunningly cinematic with its use of location and parallel crosscutting whilst Marnau assembles a gallery of unforgettable and chilling shots, not least the sight of a shadowed Orlok creeping swiftly upstairs ready to devour his victim. Eighty years down the line, Marnau's work firmly stands as a superior piece of silent cinema as well as one of the definitive horror classics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Silent Horrors You'll see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nosferatu is one of the most celebrated Horror films ever, and with good reason. It's beautifully directed by F.W. Murnau (one of Germany's greatest Directors in any field), and as it's not terribly scary by any standards today, it still creates a sense of atmosphere which sticks with the film.The story of Nosferatu is fairly predictable considering, but it's still fun. From The Castle meeting with Count Orlock and Hutter to Nosferatu's slow take over the boat, and not to mention beautiful visuals filmed in outdoor German outback by Murnau. And don't forget the classic window and shadow scenes! Speaking of visuals, we have one of the best looking and disturbing icons of horror, or cinema in general with Nosferatu, with his long pointy fingers, to his warped face. He's become a popular culture icon for obvious reasons. Nosferatu is played well by his role, but Hutter is also well played (by silent movie standards of course).If there are problems with Nosferatu, it's that the plot is a big confusing to explaining why characters like Knock do what they do. And also some effects are a bit awkward, such as the speeding up of the camera for the horse chase, to the stop motion effects of Nosferatu's coffins and boat trip. Even in 1922, these shots could be done better.Regardless, the above is petty bickering. This isn't the best German Expressionist Horror film (The Cabinet of Dr.Caligari holds this title), but this one that sticks with you visually and in mood. When i first watched this film. I watched this for the first time at Midnight and in a Dark room alone. It was perfect. I suggest you all do the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nosferatu. The very mention of the name strikes fear in ones heart, and so it should. This chilling master piece is one of the most frightening films created. Although silent, what it lacks in sound it makes up for in atmosphere. You shudder when the grotesque vampire comes on screen but cant help but watch due to the amazing costume and make-up. No cape was needed for this terrifying count, he makes our skin crawl without the use of blood and creepy accents. His very presence makes us want to reach for the light switch. The infamous scene when the vampire rises unaided from his chest is one of the most frightening images of a monster ever pictured. The feeding scenes are equally as frightening and allot we see no blood, little is left to the imagination. A historic master- piece. Well worth viewing.</fullReview>

Hutter creates a vampire after reading the vampire book he finds in his room. Ellen too after she reads the book.It's interesting how the link between Murnau's creation and a book was so easily discovered (Stoker's widow sued), while the link between Hutter's creation and its book seems to have gone largely unnoticed (if you accept my reading of the film). E. Elias Merhige and Steven Katz noticed. In their film "Shadow of the Vampire", they merely changed Black Death delirium/hysteria to drug-induced delirium/hysteria.Some of the compositions are great. The stop-motion FX might seem a little jerky but that just adds to my reading of the film.</fullReview>

The sets are out of this world with doors and windows at odd angles to each other and of weird and wonderful design and the vampire monster is truly horrific. I just wonder what these guys would have done with todays technology cause in a nut shell this film raises more hairs than most of your more modern vampire flicks out together. Creepy shadows abound as our young hero falls more and more into the grasp of Nosferatu. Its a must see for any horror fan as their is something to be said for going back in time to look forward. This film is undiluted, contains none of the usual normalities that tend to dog down modern horror and whats more the state of the art special effects (1922) style take some beating. Do those doors really open that way?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, much has been said regarding the greatness of this film, and it is true - it's an unforgettable masterpiece. But only if you get a version that is close to the original 1922 release. Over time, many poor prints were released. Large parts of the film were thought lost for a long time. In 1988, Enno Patalas was able to reconstruct nearly the whole movie based on an original print discovered in South America. Remarkable in this version is especially the restoration of the original titles and the tinting - yes, "Nosferatu" wasn't simply black and white originally! E.g. night scenes were tinted blue, the titles green. This looks very interesting and really adds to the atmosphere.For this restored version, new music was written by German composer Hans Posegga. The score - eery and full of memorable tunes - is in my opinion the best Nosferatu music as yet. Sadly, it isn't available on any DVD I know of, and even the German television that used to air it with the Posegga music seems to have switched to a different one.The DVDs one can currently get seem all to have rather poor English titles - poorly designed (the German ones are often artfully hand-written) and overly shortened. I saw a similar German version in cinema - the rough, simple titles felt like a considerable stylistic incongruity to me, knowing the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie, and has become one of my faves. I will have to say that this film, IN CONTRAST with today's graphic horror movies, is visually 'tame', but if you can put this behind you and actually picture this thing (Nosferatu)after YOU, it changes it a bit. It is scary without actually being too graphic. Also, you have to remember this is one of the first motion pictures,so just right there it's great.( The ship scene,ACTUALLY ON A BOAT!! Nosferatu disappearing,polyps with claws, etc.)Even though it is a silent film, it's still great, and not as bothersome to read everything as you would think. The decor, the clothes, everything is awesome. Personally. and it's not a slam on Max Schrek, but he's pretty ghoulish even without makeup, so they chose THE right person for the role. That guy is thin and TALL!!! I like the way they made him seem scary, unlike, as David Carradine said on the version that I have, the 'suave, sexy Dracula.' It can make a story line a bit hard to follow when there is some sort of attempt at sex appeal going on. Although I can safely say I have never had a thing for IL Drac. In a nutshell: This film was ahead of it's time, and is worth a look. A Fave.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite vampire movies of all time. It is dark, moody, and has an other-worldly atmosphere to it that most other vampire movies lack. Max Schreck's performance is the highlight of the movie. His appearance alone is enough to frighten anyone approaching his castle. Schreck's body language is so unorthodox that, it too, becomes unnerving. The cinematography of the film is superb, whether you see it in black and white or with the color lenses applied. The color being used to aid in the development of mood. Murnau's pacing of the movie also adds to the overall effect of the film, seeming to tow the line between slow enough to create tension and quick enough to prevent you from losing interest. I'm not saying this is the best vampire movie of all time, but I would argue that there are very few that are better than this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie created in 1922 was probably the best movie for 40 years after it was made. A really great silent film that combines a good story with some very good makeup. This black and white film has very good and very creepy music that makes it an instant horror classic. A movie for the old horror movie fans out there if you haven't already seen it. Max Schreck made this movie very scary with his makeup and haunting actions. The movie is made scary by using camera angles to only show shadows cast of the vampire about to strike. This would be a movie for older audiences to watch because of the horror violence and also because it is a silent film which would involve reading. Again probably the best movie of its time. I love this movie and I'm sure that most of those will hold it as a classic like i do. I give this movie **** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will admit that I hold a special place for 'silent' films. My only complaint about them is that the music tracks that have been added to most of them really takes away from the film. With some of these movies, you either turn the volume down or create your own soundtrack by mixing some of your own favorite music. This film is my absolute favorite silent film. I hold it up there with "The Phantom of the Opera" and "Metropolis." In fact, "Metropolis" has an audio track that really suits the film. But, "Nosferatu" is best watched with the sound off. The music is good, don't get me wrong.. But, it doesn't match the picture and, in some ways, it's quite distracting, in my opinion.If you're tired of giving it chances, try one more for my sake. Then, if you don't like it, pass and move on. But, at least give it one more fighting chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematic Gem Of German Propaganda Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saturday79 hit it right on the head-- this is a film that at its heart is a condemnation of the Bolsheviks and their Communist ideals, which had come to power in Russia five years earlier. This eastern menace is portrayed as the new Black Plague, spreading across Europe and leaving destruction in its wake. The Plague metaphor is carried far, complete with rats and wagons carrying the dark dead bodies of the afflicted. I don't think it is a mistake that Orlok looks like Lenin with rat ears and teeth. It is also amusing that the vampire, usually a metaphor for seduction, is repulsive. Again, I don't think this is an accident. Imagine the horror of a German who falls under the spell of the Bolshevik monster, only to see its true form when it's too late.The Weimar Republic had good reason to fear the Bolsheviks considering the economic state of Germany at the time, and it is fascinating how Murnau is able to reconcile a story that he loves (Dracula) with government propaganda to make an incredible and lasting art film that was resonant beyond its time.Another interesting aspect of this film is Murnau's blending of impressionism and expressionism. At times his film is overtly expressionist, with ominous skies and oddly shaped sets, while at other times he takes an impressionist tact, mostly during scenes of the peace in Bremen before the arrival of Orlok. This in itself is another political comparison between the Weimar Republic and the Bolsheviks.With its political insight within its own time that would prove resonant if not downright prophetic in the coming decades, combined with its cinematic ingenuity that began to blaze trails for future films, Nosferatu is clearly a great film that deserves its place in the history of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Setting the film in its political context</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[SPOILER ALERT!!]People have already said everything there is to say about the film itself, mainly that it is a fantastic film, a wonderful achievement for 1922 with the special effects of the carriage etc., superb use of light-shadow contrast and a testimony to expressionist acting, although not the expressionist set which we see in films such as Caligari (Wiene, 1919).However, what many people ignore is the potency of the political message of the film. 1922 was at the height of hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic which ruled over Germany from 1919 to 1933. The public were used to frequent, violent political confrontation between factions on the extreme left and extreme right.What we see in Nosferatu is a theme typical of early Weimar cinema: the omnipresent, omnipotent tyrant in the form of Nosferatu (also Caligari, Dr. Mabuse etc.). The tyrant comes from the east (it is unsure what this represents, though I would argue that, given the political situation and the recent communist uprising in Russia, it is the Bolshevists) and we see by comparing the first shot of a quiet, tranquil 'traditional German' town and the last shot of a dilapidated, ruined castle, the progress from the bourgeois ideal into anarchy, chaos and destruction during the film.The film shows that no-one was able to stop Nosferatu in his tracks before he arrived to ruin Wisborg, the town where the film is set. Only Ellen, by sacrificing herself and giving her life, can stop the tyrant. So soon after WWI, it is clear that such a sacrifice is not portrayed as desirable. The film removes Van Helsing, the policeman in the Dracula novel, from the plot, meaning that there is no strong force in 'traditional' Germany- the power is held by Hutter, a middle-class estate agent. The middle classes in power at the time in Germany were the liberals of the Weimar Republic. Hutter is portrayed as weak, easily overcome and without much of a clue as to what's going on. This is clearly a call for a strong leader to fill the evident void in Germany, to come in and rescue society from the threat of being taken over by Bolshevism.When we look at Murnau's later films, such as Dr. Mabuse, Der Spieler, it becomes clear that the right-wing (not Nazi) anti-authoritarian message of the film was not a one-off on his part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw Nosferatu a few years ago it really was quite an experience. It was my induction into the world of silent cinema, something that I have now grown very fond of. It was also one of the first vampire films I had seen. I have now seen several of each genre, and Nosferatu remains a standout. It truly uses the lack of sound to it's advantage, creating a chilling atmosphere and real sense of foreboding. The camerawork is excellent, showing some early innovation, and genuinely helps with the narrative which, at times, can be a little slow and plodding. Although it is not the greatest silent film I have seen, it is still the best vampire film. Had I seen a lesser silent film first, I fear I may never had kept my interest in them. 8/10.</fullReview>

The tale is well told and Schreck's acting is brilliant. Clearly, these are actors who understood the limitations of lighting and sound in the twenties.Schreck plays Nosferatu so well, that even I found it quote credible despite my skepticism about silent cinema ... my main interests lying in today's action-packed thrillers complete special effects, etc. But Schreck's insistence on playing the part of the vampire on and off screen got me going and his dramatic gestures, his gazes, nearly all his movements scared me silly.I recommend this movie to anyone who likes scary movies. It is a must-see as it paved the way for all the horror films that ever came after it. Enjoy!</fullReview>

Nosferatu is clawed demonlike vampire with rat like features who greedily sucks his victim's blood. Max Shreck is brilliant as the vampire Count Orlock. One can view this film on several levels by making money our GOD we have to deal with the devil (Hutter deals with Orlock to make a profit and any normal person would have left upon entering CASTLE ORLOCK, but money drove him to stay.) However having said that I prefer to look at this as a straight horror film filled with gaunt shadows and strange camera work (animation, negative images, and slow motion.) A great example of early cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last year I had a Cinema &amp; Civilization course in college and it had to be THE greatest course I ever had in my life. My favorite part was the German Expressionism era. We watched Das Kabinett des Doktor Caligari and Metropolis, which were both absolutely great movies. However we only got to see clips from Nosferatu, so the teacher could show us the characteristics of this era. Then a couple of months later, I found myself staying up late, and by pure coincidence, I happened to catch the movie from the very beginning. It might have been 3am, but I was wide awake throughout the whole movie and thoroughly enjoyed it. This masterpiece will live on forever, and I recommend this film to everyone who wants to know how it was done back then. I also highly recommend Metropolis and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari if you want to know more about German expressionism. 10/10</fullReview>

One of my first findings, recommended by my father was 'Nosferatu'. Watching it for the first time on a dark snowy night sent the blood in my veins into a freezing churn. The vampire, 'Graf Orlok', resembles a bald, albino gerbil, with an extreme case of anorexia. One of the creepiest features of the film is home Graf Orlak moves about, like a ghost dragging his sheets. Upon finishing the film, and many other vampire pictures, I have decided that this is one of the best, by far. Though produced in 1922, it is still a fine specimen of movie making.10/10</fullReview>

He wants to replace his old servant(Knock) to a new one?or is she attracted by him or she wants to destroy him? We dont have the true answer and for that reason Murnau's Nosferatu remain a Masterpiece,eerie photography,clever montages and an atmosphere that stay in our memory,our fears, like a haunting Gothic Tale. 9/10</fullReview>

The creakiness of the silent movie style actually adds to the nightmare atmosphere. The rats and caravans of coffins that the vampire leaves in his wake attest to the evil cunning of this seemingly undefeatable monster. Yet, without being cliche, the film ends with the theme that love conquers all, even the most monstrous horrors in the world. If you like scary movies, this is the one to see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a work of art and a truly pernicious film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone admires this film; it's seminal for film makers and horror buffs alike. But I have a deep moral problem with it. Don't read this review if you love the film and don't want to risk spoiling it for yourself.This seems to me a difficult movie to watch as soon as you notice the close physical resemblance between Nosferatu and the Jewish capitalist who's responsible for sending our clean-cut, healthy, country-living, ber-German hero into mortal danger. It's the presence of the Jew in German society that makes it vulnerable to this other mythic incarnation of bloodsucking, anti-Christian evil - one wonders if the immortal vampire figure gets some of its mythic resonance from the Romantic myth of the Wandering Jew.Nosferatu, a memorably demonic, visibly lost incarnation of pure evil (an evil which has at its centre the melancholia of being beyond grace, rather than the theatrical flamboyance of evil in, say, Shakespeare's "Richard III") is visually a parody of a parody of a Jew. Much of the film's cultural agenda, with its clunking evocation of bluff Arian healthiness (exacerbated in the recent restored print by a poor musical score which seemed understandably inclined to send up its protagonists), is pretty embarrassing, but too obvious to do much damage. Nosferatu himself, though, is a really insidious evil, because in terms of cinematic artistry and in Max Schreck's performance it's as extraordinary as everyone says. But I can't agree with Werner Herzog that the 1922 "Nosferatu" as it were critiques by anticipation the rise of Nazism: it colludes in it, by subcutaneously fostering the attitudes that made Nazism culturally normal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the original film of vampire films and has not been matched. For its time, it has spectacular special effects, and the film has an eerie atmosphere even without the music. Orlock is truly undead, not a handsome Christopher Lee type, but revoltingly realistic. There are some nuances to this film that may not be obvious on first viewing, but after a few viewings or listening to commentary like on the DVD version they can be revealed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nosferatu, a Symphony of Horrors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen the Paul Whitehouse spoof in The Fast Show, so I recognised the villain of the piece whenever I saw clips, and I couldn't wait to see the full film. This was the first ever adaptation of Bram Stoker's Stoker's Dracula, the Bela Lugosi version came nine years later. I should note that this film wasn't authorised by Bram Stoker, so all names were changed for copyright reasons, so I have provided the film names, and new names, so you don't get confused. Anyway, basically Jonathon Harker/Hutter (Gustav Von Wangenheim) is going to the castle of Count Dracula/Orlock (Max Schreck) in Transylvania, to have him sign papers to buy a house next to his in Bremen. Harker soon realises he is in the company of a vampire, and even wakes with bite marks on his neck. He does manage to escape, and while recuperating in hospital, the Count, in his coffin, travels to his new house, and plans to have the blood of Jonathon's/Hutter's wife Nina/Ellen (Greta Schrder). With Dracula/Orlock in the town, a plague covers the town, and more people are becoming sick and dying in mysterious circumstances. Nina/Ellen read "The Book of Vampires", so she knew that Nosferatu (as he can be called) can be killed after the cock crows, and he dies stepping into the trapping sunlight. Also starring Alexander Granach as Knock/Renfield, John Gottowt as The Professor/Bulwer and Max Nemetz as Captain of the 'Demeter'. I recognised the many moments of the film, such as Nosferatu staring while reading the letter to sign, lying in his coffin, rising from it, walking on the ship, standing by the window, and his shadow the climbing the stairs, many considered great German expressionism. It may be a little shaky, black and white and silent, but it is a must see for fans of vampire films, or just films in general. It was number 38 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Origin of Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is it that makes a great horror movie? There has to be a lot of spooks and thrills that make it scary of course. But it can't be cheesy with a thin plot. There has to be a good, believable story...at least a good story. It has to be something you can follow along with and enjoy. Throw all of this together and you have yourself a horror movie. Today's horror movies focus on special effects and sometimes gory images that sometimes make you laugh. All of these films try to duplicate what the original horror film did. Flat out creep you out. Nosferatu did just that.Nosferatu is the essential horror movie. Filmed in 1922, it was a silent picture starring Max Schrek as Count Orlok, the vampire based on Dracula from Bram Stoker's classic novel about a vampire who moves from his castle to the city after a visit by Jonathon Hutter. This unauthorized version of Stoker's classic features Schrek as the thin, creepy, blood-sucking vampire. The story unfolds as Harker tries to settle the deal with the Count so he can move into his new home...right near Hutter. Little does he know that the Count is a vampire. After a close encounter after dinner with Orlok, Hutter is convinced that this guy is out for blood...literally. Now Orlok is moving into Hutter's town of Bremen, bringing in with him the plague. Hutter and his wife are dragged into this ordeal with Orlok. Along with the rest of the town, Orlok and the plague turn the town upside down.What makes this film so impressive is the result of Orlok's terrifying secret. Since Hutter doesn't know that he is a vampire, his expression of sheer horror when he finds out makes the movie kind of realistic. Although the thought of a person who drinks blood is preposterous, it's still scary as hell! Just the appearance of Count Orlok is frightening. There is a scene when Hutter realizes what the Count is and he opens the door to see him just standing there. The camera zooms in and he's just standing there. His hands at his side, nightcap off exposing his bald head and pointy ears. The sharp, narrow fangs hang down as if ready to bite your neck. Dracula is a familiar tale told for many years, but this portrayal is very scary, the silence is even scary.Although Bela Lugosi is known for the role of Count Dracula nine years after the release of Nosferatu, it was this movie that really got the Dracula fascination started. Nosferatu will continue to inspire and creep out all who watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contrary to popular belief, Nosferatu was not the first film version of "Dracula." A version was made 1914 but all known copies were lost or destroyed over the years. No copies of the 1914 version are known to exist today.As for Nosferatu, the film is excellent. The word "masterpiece" is used a lot, but Nosferatu has truly earned that title. It is a great example of Greman expressionism. Max Schreck was truly at his best. Schreck's portrayal of the head vampire rivals that of Bela Lugosi in the later 1931 talking film, "Dracula."Considering the technological limitations of the 1920's, the film was well made. If you are new to silent films, I strongly recommend Nosferatu.</fullReview>

However, as zorak-10 and others had mentioned earlier, there are some DVD releases of this film that were colorized, and or had different soundtracks from the original release. While this DVD I picked up was still in black and white, it had the names of all the characters changed to match those in the book, so Orlock is called Count Dracula, Hutter is Harker and Greta is Nina as they were in the original Dracula novel. Still, anyone who is a true horror fan should see some of the originals and this one stands out as that.</fullReview>

The director directed the movie very carefully and gave it a very eerie look by not centering a lot of the time, speeding up the film and not using very many diolouge screens.This movie tells the story of Bracula, but move over Bella Lagosi, this is better. Different names and settings have been used to delete the threat of being sued. Such as Count Dracula ha been changed to Count Orlock. Otherwise the first vampire movie is just like your story, Bram Stoker!Although many sources online will let you download this movie entirely, it is definately much better if you watch this movie on VHS or DVD, in the dark. Also, rent the color-tinted version and change it to black and white on your TV. This is the closest version to the original, and by far the best print. Also when you watch it, DON'T GO TO SLEEP!!

		<fullReview>"Nosferatu" is better for the impact it had on subsequent films in the vampire/Dracula genre rather than as a movie in its own right. It's stylish to look at, that's for sure. Creepy use of light and shadow and skewed camera angles create a very atmospheric film. But ultimately it's just too stilted and limited by primitive silent film limitations to be truly frightening. Max Schreck makes a memorable vampire, but I had trouble staying awake at the screening I attended, which came with live organ accompaniment. I know this film is adored by movie buffs and the critical community, and I wanted to like it. Maybe on a repeat viewing I would find more to admire. However, as is, I wouldn't give this a whole-hearted recommendation.Grade: C+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is the mighty Murnau masterpiece, the Nosferatu movie that everyone raves about. Contained within is an adaptation of the immortal Stoker story, Dracula, where a disturbingly lethal vampire hunts the streets and sucks the blood of innocents! Too bad I'm slightly disappointed.Murnau obviously has skill, I'll give him that, I can see his creativity and inspiration really saturating the imagery of his films. Unfortunately, the whole atmosphere of this movie doesn't quite seem to cut it. It's too bright, so to speak, and the pacing is where it falls apart. I've seen clips of the ending in many different documentaries, film classes, and the like, and it's rather well done except that it seems to interrupt the steady silentness of the stalking killer. It just washes away magically......and you can see him in the mirror, which goes against a major plot point around the beginning of the story when Jonathon sees the door open in the mirror, turns around and sees Nosferatu standing there. *Sigh* Anyways, the key staying power of this film is the imagery of Nosferatu himself, Max Schreck looking downright deadly in his tall, bat-eared stance. The shadow-work of course is another brilliant part, and it's a joy to see it so clearly defined and strong against the background, very much helping the feeling of stalking doom.Secondly, the motif of the disease is interesting. I love the idea of the Pestilence eating away at a community while individuals struggle with the source of the evil. Played better (or maybe, *GASP*, remade???), it definitely creates a good, haunting story.I can see why this film is worshiped, I just have a few problems with it's exposition. It deserves a watch, but I'm not quite sure it exactly deserves all that praise.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of expressionism and terror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having loved Faust(1926) I realised I had never seen Nosferatu(1922), which was apparently even better. I could really kick myself, for Nosferatu is every bit as good as everybody says. As much as I did love Faust, I love Nosferatu even more. It plays loosely with the Dracula story but is just as effective. The film is atmospheric, and the scary scenes still pack a powerful punch, the finale with Orlock's shadow outside his victim's door is terrifying. The expressionistic images do look really beautiful, but not overly so to undermine the scares or the atmosphere. The restored version's music score is suitably haunting, and FW Murnau's direction is superb. But if anything is to be remembered long after Nosferatu is over, other than the ending, it is the performance of Max Schreck. He is mesmerising as Orlock, exuding great amounts of authority and making scenes all the more tense. And this is by his appearance alone, the grasping claws, pointed fangs and cadaverous white body is enough to give anybody nightmares.So all in all, a masterpiece. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nosferatu (1922) **** (out of 4) Murnau's masterpiece of German Expressionism has Max Shreck playing the role of Court Orlok in this (at the time illegal) adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel. If you've seen one version of the novel then you've pretty much seen all of them as each film takes away and adds their own interpretation of the novel. I won't argue how faithful or non-faithful this film is but there's no denying the power it has and the fact that it's one of the greatest adaptations out there and might only be surpassed by the equally masterful remake from Werner Herzog and Klaus Kinski. I think what works so well here is that Murnau pays so much attention to every little detail that every single frame of this movie has something interesting to look at. There isn't a single shot in this film that doesn't appear to have taken hours to set up because of either the lighting, the angle or just how many interesting things there are to see. Check out the sequence where Hutter looks down from his window to see the coffins being packed up. While watching the film you'll notice the coffins and all the work being done but on repeat viewings actually look at everything else going on around it. The same can be said for the shot of Orlok rising out of his coffin, which is perhaps one of the greatest single shots in film history. There's so much going on in this scene that you could look away from the actual rising and still feel the rich, eerie atmosphere that's running on overdrive. The performance by Schreck certainly lives up to everything ever written and his look is a work of art. The pointed ears and those fingers makes for one of the best creations ever to grace the screen. The entire sequence aboard the ship is also one of the most haunting as we get countless great moments from the dirt being revealed from the coffin, to Orlok's rising and then the scene with the ill men. I think the film's one weakness is that it starts off a tad bit slow but it quickly picks up and keeps getting better as it moves along to the wonderful ending. There have been hundreds of other vampire movies to come along since this one but it's really hard to think of any that's better. The remake from Herzog might surpass this but either way, this is a true legend of cinema that deserves its reputation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seminal but flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those who rate this film a full 10/10 do film criticism a disservice by lowering standards so low. While containing powerful scenes that remain landmarks in film history and have seldom been matched, the film itself is overlong (I have just seen the 85 minute version at the town cinema here in Germany) and, at times, incoherent. The acting alone is a major flaw and makes one question how anyone could overlook the stilted mannerisms and over-acting to describe this as a masterpiece. The stop-motion may have been revolutionary at the time, but it seriously dates the film. Where the film retains its value is in the context. Made three years after the Great War, Nosferatu can be seen to represent a Germany that was untouched by the battles but saw its population decimated by a hidden killer courtesy of the British blockade which saw perhaps as many as 750,000 die of starvation-related illness. Soldiers returned home to a familiar landscape but with everything upside down courtesy of the revolution and constant assassination and coup attempts. Within a dozen years the NSDAP will have taken power and a true symphony of terror occur. http://tracesofevil.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a disappointingly boring and ugly movie. I appreciate horror of all eras, from the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari on. I've read and enjoyed the original Bram Stoker novel, and seen many of the film incarnations. I felt as though I had been putting off this classic, but really I wasn't missing much. I'm afraid I'll have to fall in with the conventional view that the 1931 Tod Browning adaptation is the best. Coppola's version is more faithful to the novel, but has its own problems (though it is still enjoyable). I know it's going against convention to disparage this movie, especially as a horror fan, but I can't find reason enough to lie or convince myself that I'm mistaken here. My experience viewing was that unpleasant.There isn't much to praise this version of the Dracula story--the action drags, the shots are desolate and ugly, the people are ugly, and the story is boiled down to flat simplicity. The only points in its favor are the vampire make-up and creepy visuals, but those aren't enough to carry a film for me.I'll be honest and say that I find it hard to appreciate silent films. I suspect it has to do with the reliance on exaggerated over-acting and visual cues akin more to theater than modern film. And so I can understand why some people might enjoy this film for the strangeness/grotesquerie of the visuals alone. I just didn't find them interesting enough to carry the film the way those of a few silent classics did, as in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, The Phantom of the Opera, and Metropolis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have tried on several occasions to watch this film and have fallen asleep every time but one. It was shown on TV in the UK with a score specially written by James Bernard, who had written many of the great scores for the Hammer horror films. It was his music that kept me awake, so I managed to see the entire film for the first and only time. I consider that this is one of the most over-rated movies on IMDb. Maybe in 1922 it was a ground breaking experience but to the modern viewer it is painfully slow and hopelessly over acted. Max Schreck is the only actor who shows any, restraint ? and he is the vampire and could possibly have got away with being a little bit over the top. His appearance and movements are the only reason to watch this old relic and the reason that I have given the film a 2. I have seen the restored DVD of this film on sale at ridiculous prices on the net and cannot imagine why anyone would pay that much to own this film. If you want to see a good Dracula movie go for Hammer's original Dracula (1958) (US Horror of Dracula). Now that certainly isn't boring.</fullReview>

I'll save us all the plot summary, plenty of those already.I have a newer DVD version, without the colorization or silly soundtrack. I personally prefer to watch this movie with a CD playing simultaneously, like the Dark Side of the Moon/Wizard of Oz trick. I have found the Clockwork Orange soundtrack (minus the Lighthouse Keeper song), Isao Tomita's Snowflakes Are Dancing and Everything You've Always Wanted to Hear On the Moog... albums work particularly well. Their use of synthesized classical music make up for the camp and thespian-ism of the film.Let's get real, this movie is NOT scary, creepy, hair raising, terrifying or worth any of the other accolades I have read on this site. Max Schrek's makeup is good, but he is TOO stiff an actor. Harker is a goof-ball. Nina looks like a 7 foot goon in most of her scenes. The captions are laughable, Renfield serves no purpose in this version of the film and so on...I have found the more recent Nosferatu (from the '70s) to be a better vampire film. If anything annoys me the most about these Gothic horror classics is their EXTREME camp. Tone it down, it will give us less to laugh about.I DO enjoy old films, but I watch them for their historic value, and to put my toddler to sleep when it's bedtime.

		<fullReview>As a historical landmark in film, Nosferatu undoubtedly stands tall: it marks the birth of the horror genre, and the first film to experiment with the art of unsettling the human mind. An entire genre and huge amount of film technique owes itself to this movie and its ilk. Nosferatu is one of the most important pieces in the early days of film.However, as a movie itself, it is at some intervals funny where it is not meant to be, and at others just irritating and painful.A lot of the pain for me, I will allow, probably came from the soundtrack. I had to watch this movie for a film class and it was played with the Art Zoyd soundtrack on the Kino version, which I suppose meant to unsettle and frighten the listener, but in fact was sort of like Bjork farting through her mouth mixed with the sound of scissors cutting paper mixed with the sound of car alarms, and once they settled on a particular Bjork-car alarm mix, they would stick with it for a good fifteen minutes or so, even if nothing of particular interest was happening. The sound of car alarms, I find, makes me very angry, and when it goes on for fifteen minutes or so, it makes me want to throw up. After over an hour of this sort of assault on my brains, I was dying inside.However, I was aware as I was watching that it was not only the soundtrack that I found unappealing. In between the major points of the storyline, there are large tracts of nothing in which there are only alternating shots of scenery, boats, and people milling around or traveling, destroying what little suspense there might have been. The main character somehow manages to be annoyingly idiotic and treacly even though we can't hear what he says; his wife is so melodramatic it is either humorous or tiring. The only good actor in the film is Max Schreck, and, to be honest, I found his appearance more funny than frightening. The movie set me up to ridicule it with its poncy opening and I couldn't get out of the mood.For its time, the movie is terribly good. For our time, the movie is at best a nostalgic remnant, and on average not horrifying or entertaining. It deserves the cult following it has gathered in regard to the greatness it once had, but as with many things, greatness fades. For the general audience, Nosferatu is a movie landmark to be seen mainly out of interest in film history, not as a method of entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Nosferatu" - not that bad-ooo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Nosferatu" is a classic - there's no doubt about that. It's the film that gave us such scenes that have remained deep within the logs of cinema history - the shadow creeping up the stairs, Max Shreck's look as the bloodthirsty Count Orlak, the German Expressionism....And yet, for me, this film was spoilt utterly and brutally by a completely rubbish score. I'm not sure which version I watched - though it was on DVD - but it sounded like an eight-year-old child playing with one of those cheap keyboards. There were elements of Goth Rock, Choirs singing, wind whistling - and it just didn't work! With a different score I may have really liked this film, perhaps even loved it - but the music, such an important factor to the film anyway on account of it being "silent", took all the suspense out of it.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Worth seeing for its historical and trivial interest, but this is not a good movie. May have been in the '20's.The vampire is good... creepy.The story is illogical as presented here, sometimes downright ridiculous.It's technologically primitive, of course.They use shots of a hyena running around some trees to represent a werewolf. Awful. Maybe they figured that no one knew what a hyena looked like back then. I don't know. But it's embarrassing now.Bad acting, as you'll find in practically any non-comedy silent film (in comedies, the kind of super-swooning and super-laughing and super-everything they do in silents works because, well, it's funny). It's the physical equivalent to screaming for the entire movie.There is no way that this is one of the 250 best movies of all time. It has far more in common with "Plan 9 From Outer Space" than it does with "The Godfather."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sorry, but this was awful. No offense to old movies (I like them, personally), and no offense to Max Schreke, who really did a good job of portraying creepy-vampire-man, but "Nosferatu" sucked.After reading the book Dracula on which this was based (yes, it says in the opening credits that it's based on Dracula), I am absolutely appalled that this is hailed as a masterpiece of horror cinema. The exaggerated acting (while understandable) is annoying and really destroys that suspension of disbelief with the silly faces that only succeed in making you laugh.It truly mangles the book; Mina Harker has become Nina Harker. Arthur, Lucy's husband, becomes simply Westenra. Lucy doesn't sleepwalk, but Mina/Nina does. Renfield is an agent as well as a mental patient. Van Helsing and Dr Seward are barely involved at all. And Dracula dies immediately after biting Mina/Nina for the first time, with no aid from the others (he gets burned by sunlight)! They even misspelled Jonathan Harker as JonathOn Harker. Come ON, people.All I can say is, this film truly destroyed my belief that old movies were the better movies. It's too incorrect to be an adaption, and it's too boring to be scary. The best thing that can be said about Nosferatu is that the bad silent acting will have you rolling in the aisles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unwatchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an awful movie. At times it was so boring I wanted to throw my TV out of the window. The guy's performance as a vampire is okay but nothing to write home about. The camera work is atrocious. It's as if the moron of a director had a towel over half the camera the whole movie. This movie was maybe groundbreaking when it was released but today it's boring and absolutely unwatchable. awful acting, awful directing in a badly dated and now stupid movie. Do yaself a favor and don't watch this movie. I'd rather sit through a marathon of snoop dogg movies then watch this one again. This movie was made in 1922 for heavens sake how can anybody possibly get any enjoyment out of something so old and primitive.</fullReview>
