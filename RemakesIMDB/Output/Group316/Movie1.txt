		<shortDescription>The Most Complete of Vampire Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The vampire genre has seen its share of lackluster films. Indeed, the centerpiece of the grand tradition, the Dracula legend, has seen so many remakes and revisionist attempts that one would be hard pressed to find a version of the tale that is original in its telling. Dracula, like it or not, is a cornerstone of Western society. And it is wholly unfortunate that Bela Lugosi is considered THE Dracula (although Hammer fans may contend that Christopher Lee holds the title since he played the good Count over twenty times).With Werner Herzog's "Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht" (also known as "Nosferatu: The Vampyre"), the old Hollywood rules seem to have been thrown out the window in favor of F.W. Murnau's striking silent film, the 1922 masterpiece "Nosferatu: Eine Symphonie der Grauens" ("Nosferatu: A Symphony of Terror"). While many purists of the genre balk at the idea of favoring the Nosferatu tale over the time-tested Tod Browning and Terence Fisher entries, one must realize that the cape-clad widow's peak Count has been sullied by a thousand parodies over time, and is simply not a frightening entity any longer. This was a matter much pondered by Francis Ford Coppola when considering his adaptation. While Gary Oldman's portrayal was serviceable and definitely different, something key was lacking from the tale.This is what Herzog and his long-time "trouble and strife" lead man Klaus Kinski found when they ventured upon the "Nosferatu" remake. Herzog shifted the attention of the viewer away from the plot, which acts mostly as a backdrop for the imagery, and made it so the primary intake becomes a visual one. Kinski's Dracula is not the scowling insect of the Murnau film. He portrays the Count in a way that no other actor has quite grasped. In this film, Dracula is a suffering being, loathing every moment of his curse's continuation. Of course, as the good Count himself states, "Young men. You are like the villagers. and cannot place yourself in the soul of the hunter." The vampyre is trapped by his instincts, and Kinski's eyes betray harrowing madness (as they did in "Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes"), spiteful malice, and a sorrow so bottomless it defies description. It is as if the beast wishes to weep, but has forgotten how.Filming on location in Germany, Herzog uses the same dreamlike camera angles, mixing them with a rich color palette and masterful lighting. There is a certain uneasiness that filters outward from the screen as you watch. As Jonathan Harker explores his surroundings during his lodging at Castle Dracula, there is inexplicably a young gypsy boy incessantly playing a scratchy violin under the archway. The surreality of the picture is only matched by its attention to the dark magic of the vampire. Like its predecessor, it actually seems to believe in the creatures, and respects them. It holds the legend, the plight of the people of Wismar, and the plight of the Count himself in deep reverence.What can be extracted from the dialogue and plot is that this is not your average bloodsuckers extravaganza. In fact, the good Count only sets his fangs to the throat of the living once on screen, and when that occurs, it lends more of a feeling of sacrifice and sorrow than of terror. Indeed, the tone of the film is driven toward tragedy, and does not shift its course. One of the film's more telling moments is when Dracula, alone with Harker's beloved Lucy, ventures to plead with the beautiful lady, "Will you come to me. become my ally? Bring salvation to your husband. and to me. The absence of love. is the most abject pain." When she refuses, he does not lash out or decide to make a meal of her then and there. He instead moans with the intonation of a wounded animal and slinks off into the night."Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht" is the most complete of vampire films, and towers over the genre. It could be considered a pity that the only film that sits upon its coattails is its predecessor of the same name. Under Herzog's direction (wisely choosing to avoid remaking classic shots), we get an entirely different film that exudes an entirely different feeling. It not only maintains the eerie horror that the genre deserves, but also achieves a beauty and mystique that has been lost over the years. A must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Werner Herzog's remake of F. W. Murnau's classic film (the story for which Murnau stole without permission from Bram Stoker) is, thus far, my absolute favorite vampire film. I've only ever met one other person who made this claim. Everyone else said they were so bored by it that they either gave up on it or fell asleep in front of the TV. I can understand this, even if I don't like it. Herzog's film moves at the pace of a fever dream, lingering long on shots of misty mountains and majestic rivers that some (like myself) will find breathtakingly beautiful, and others will find stunningly dull. This is a shame, but in these days of ten car chases, eight explosions and five sweaty sex scenes per film, I guess no one wants to appreciate the scenery as a main character anymore. Herzog has always had a knack for this, as anyone who has seen "Aguirre, the Wrath of God" well knows.But, I digress. This version of Nosferatu, in places almost a frame for frame remake, is a masterpiece of homage. The slow, somewhat exaggerated reactions of his characters brilliantly echo the performances given by the silent actors in the original film. The landscape is moody and lovely and the sets are gorgeous, especially the phantom castle of The Count, haunted by memories and the strange ghost of a violin playing child. Lovely, ice-white Isabelle Adjani is here as the good and virtuous Lucy (the name reversal of the female characters is rather inexplicable, but it doesn't really matter) floating through the film like a beautiful dream and never once weakening in her faith, even in the face of ultimate horror. Bruno Ganz is somewhat stiff and unemotional, and one has to wonder why Lucy goes to such lengths to save this man who, for some reason, she loves with all her heart. Only in his moments of sickness and fear does Ganz emerge from his emotional void. But it is Klaus Kinski's incredible shadow that stretches over this film and swallows it whole. Kinski plays his rat-faced, bald headed vampire with perfection. Yes, he complains about the loneliness of being undead, he laments his existence outside the realm of love and humanity, but he does it with a shrug instead of a whine, as if to say: "Yeah, I'm pretty much screwed, but what're ya gonna do?" He brings to his role of Vampire what very few actors (aside from Gary Oldman) have been able to: sympathy. He may hate what he has become, but he never apologizes for it. He is the ultimate scavenger, feeding off the dead and hiding in the darkness. Kinski's Count cannot even seduce. He simply takes. But his one scene with Isabelle is simply devastating, as he at long last reaches out to someone, hoping for love and salvation, and then quickly withdraws, the pain quite clear on his face, as he is sternly rejected. The ending seems rather rushed and not very well thought-out; a true downer which basically nullifies the film. But the rest of the film is more than worth it, from the opening scenes of rotting mummies and bats flying in slow motion through to the muted spectacle of plague ridden madness as the dying dance in the streets to mournful background music. If you're expecting lots of splattering blood and half dressed girls writhing on their beds, then forget about appreciating this movie. You won't. But if you have a taste for grown-up fairy tales and stunning visuals, see this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another classic collaboration of Werner Herzog and Klaus Kinski, Nosferatu is not just a remake of the F. W. Murnau silent classic, but an extension of it. Herzog not only develops the Stoker story more directly than the original did, but even reintroduces the original characters - Orlok becomes Dracula, and the Hutters become the Harkers. Like many of the films involving Herzog and Kinski, Nosferatu is a period piece and creates the context of its plot through beautiful cinematography and a relentless but unhasty pace, not through the script. ThoughKinski dominates the screen just as he always does in these collaborations, the performances of fellow greats Isabelle Adjani and Bruno Ganz are also worthy of mention. Ganz's Jonathan Harker is certainly the most sympathetic character in the film, and Adjani's Lucy is beautiful, spooky, and just odd enough to fit the role perfectly.Nosferatu is a retelling of the Dracula tale. Unlike its generally inferior competitors, Nosferatu - both the 1922 and 1979 versions - sticks very close to Bram Stoker's text - neither elaborating the focus on bloodsucking (obsessed upon by most American interpretations of Dracula), nor revising Jonathan Harker and Dr. Van Helsing as heroic characters, nor adding erotic or romantic elements to the depravity of the original concept. If you know what Stoker was about, you will thrill to the often forgotten aspects of Stoker's novel which are redeemed here - the plague rats, the gypsies, etc.Kinki's intensity allows him to become a perfect Dracula. He understands his role perfectly and never once slips out of 'the hunter'. This is another very important aspect of the Stoker legend which has been sadly contorted by the popularization of the Dracula legend. Nosferatu's Count Dracula is not a charming eastern European gentleman with a quirky bloodsucking habit and a lovesick soul, he is a wily, terrifying, soulless, inhuman, obsessive, predator. And he has absolutely no concern for the affairs of Homo sapiens sapiens.The film is mostly shot in Amsterdam's old city, which fits the mood of the film well. Other locations are in Germany, and Dracula's castle, for once, is an actual castle - even the interior shots! The wonderfully eerie and disorienting Popul Vuh soundtrack compliments the typically Herzogian picture-perfect visuals.This is a great film for those seeking an accessible introduction to film-as-art, and the legendary collaborations of Herzog and Kinski. It will likely annoy those who think of Dracula as a good looking romantic guy with a nasty habit, but is highly recommended for fans of Stoker's original work..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hypnotic and exquisitely photographed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Werner Herzog's version of Murnau's classic NOSFERATU is a captivating experience. Klaus Kinski is perfect as Count Dracula. He brilliantly conveys the loneliness and sadness of a creature who longs to be human. Count Dracula is the victim in this film, he does not enjoy his immortality and wants only to live, love and die like a human. Isabelle Adjani's ethereal beauty punctuates her ghostlike performance as Lucy, and Bruno Ganz turns in another solid performance as Jonathan.Like other Herzog films, NOSFERATU THE VAMPYRE is exquisitely photographed, eliciting an almost transcendental experience. Jonathan's journey to Dracula's castle, the dancing of the plague-ridden townsfolk, and the final scene are prime examples.Once again, using the compositions of Popol Vuh and Wagner, Herzog creates an effective amalgamation of images an music.One drawback to the film is that it is so beautiful to look at, it is not especially frightening. This may discourage some Dracula fans, but to those who want a hypnotic, smart vampire film, this is the one to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dracula Herzog style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was only recently that I finally got to experience a Werner Herzog film. And I say experience because you don't just watch a Werner Herzog film, you experience it. Otherwordly images will appear on the screen whisking you away to strange unusual worlds. When I first saw Fitzcarraldo and Aguirre: The Wrath of God I was spellbound. I was astounded at how much Herzog could evoke while relying solely on the grandness of his visuals. So when I decided to finally see Werner Herzogs remake of F.W. Murnaus classic silent film Nosferatu, I knew I was in for something special. And I was. Simply put, this is one of the finest vampire movies ever made.The story is one every horror fan is familiar with. Count Dracula is interested in purchasing a new home in England, so Jonathan Harker a real estate agent is sent to Draculas castle high in the Carpathian mountains to sign the legal documents that will seal the deal. Of course what Harker isn't ready for is the fact that Count Dracula is actually a vampire, a man who sold his soul to Satan and now walks the earth as an undead bloodsucker. Dracula falls for Harkers girl and tries to take her from him, you know the drill.From the small synopsis I typed on that last paragraph you think, yeah, seen one Dracula you seen em all. Right? Wrong! Though this movie does have the same plot line that we have seen hundreds of times in different vampire films, this one certainly has something that makes it different. First and foremost, this film was directed by Werner Herzog and it isn't going to be your regular ordinary vampire movie. There's a certain visual splendor that goes with all of Herzogs films and its evidently present in this film.What I admire most about Herzog is that he doesn't rely on special effects to make his movies visually interesting. The guy goes to a mountain deep in the middle of nowhere, he looks for the most beautiful and exotic location possible and then shoots his film there. He did it in Aguirre and Fitzcarraldo and he did it again here. Herzogs special effects depend on nature itself. When Jonathan Harker embarks on his journey towards Draculas castle you'll be swept away on a journey that takes you to misty mountains and forceful rivers. So be ready for a film that takes you to some of the most beautiful and exotic places on this earth.This really isn't a full remake of Murnaus film because what this film really does is mix both Murnaus film and Bram Stokers novel. Instead of Count Orlock we get Dracula. So its sort of a mix of both sources.Then of course we have the second strongest point in many of Herzogs films. Actor Klaus Kinsky. This guy completely devours the Dracula character and brings him to life in a way that no other actor has ever done. This Dracula isn't a sexy, well dressed lady killer. This guy is animalistic in nature, a creature hunting for his pray, a tortured soul yes, almost disgusted at who he is but at the same time accepting it fully. So much is conveyed through Kinskys performance, his eyes, his hands and pointy nails, and his whispering voice. A very creepy Dracula if you ask me.A thing that makes this film standout as well is its realism. There's not a single special effect on this movie save for Klaus Kinskys Dracula make up. Everything else is as real as it gets. Draculas castle isn't a miniature or computer generated image, its a real castle. Its not even a set! Its a real freaking castle! When Dracula sucks blood he doesn't go into a bloodbath dripping blood all over the place, he sucks the blood with great care and precision not to spill a single drop. Almost like a baby sucking on his mothers breast. When the sun hits a vampire, its not a visual effects spectacle, the vampire just dies and falls in the floor when the sun hits him. When Dracula transforms into a bat, Herzog shows a real life bat in slow motion in all its natural beauty. Its like everything is done in the most realistic way possible. Nothing is an exaggeration. And when Draculas shadow moves along as if having a life of its own, its an effect done for real. On camera with lights and shadows. Kind of reminded me of Gary Shermans Poltergeist III in that sense.A warning though, this movie is not fast paced. Its deliberately paced to be creepy and dreamlike. Herzog will stay focused on things for long periods of time so you can really transport yourself to the moment. Well at least thats the way I saw it, I'm sure many people out there might find the movie extremely slow or boring. But not me. To me, this movie was extremely creepy and realistic. Extremely well acted on Kinskys part and just an extremely cool visual trip.If you're one of those persons that needs explosions and gunshots every five minutes steer clear away from this one, but in the other hand if you have an artistic side that can appreciate a beautiful film like this one then I highly recommended you check Nosferatu: The Vampire right away and experience the visual splendor of a Werner Herzog film.Rating: 5 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kinski Rules</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this as part of a double feature with Aguirre: The Wrath of God. Needless to say, it wasn't an evening of giggles. This is a film from beginning to end about pestilence. There is the actual plague. There are characters who are walking demonstrations of pestilence. There is the sad, defeated, Count who, as we all know, is not happy with his condition, but is programmed to steep himself in blood. The characters of Kinski and Adjani are on a collision course. Only through human sacrifice and lust can this demon be destroyed. It's a gray, striking film, full of sadness and despair. Kinski is visually stunning as the vampire. He is remindful of count Orlock in the Murnau film. There is more sensuality in this film (there are less limitations). Still, like its predecessor, the star of the show is death and the scenes with the rats and the people dancing away their last days, the coffins carried through the streets, are as striking as any performance. Herzog brings out the weight of human despair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atmospheric Remake of a Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Wismar, Germany, Lucy (Isabelle Adjani) and the real state agent Jonathan Harker (Bruno Ganz) is a happily married couple. Jonathan's boss Renfield (Roland Topor) sends him to Transylvania to sell an old house in Wismar to Count Dracula (Klaus Kinski). Jonathan is advised by the locals of a village to return since the count is a vampire, but he does not give up of his intent.Jonathan visits Count Dracula and when he sees the photograph of Lucy, he immediately buys the real estate. He drinks the blood of Jonathan and navigates to Wismar, carrying coffins with the soil of his land, rats and plague in the ship. Along the voyage, Count Dracula kills the crew-members and a ghost vessel arrives in Wismar. Meanwhile Jonathan rides to his homeland to save Lucy from the vampire. "Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht" is a wonderful and atmospheric remake of F. W. Murnau's classic film based on Bram Stoker's novel (but uncredited). Herzog has also changed the ending of the novel and uses wonderful cinematography supported by magnificent performances in his version. Klaus Kinski is one of the scariest Dracula of cinema history. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Nosferatu - O Vampiro da Noite" ("Nosferatu ? The Vampire of the Night")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What artistic brilliance upon Werner Herzog's behalf, but Klaus Kiniski and Isabelle Adjani stamp their lasting marks as well. Never have I been so caught up, amazed and blown away from such profound positioning, poetically creative imagery and mesmerizing performances. I found it incredibly hard to take my eyes off the screen, even though the story has been done to death. Each vividly lush and fairy-tale engraved set piece is set-up, and I hungrily waited to analyse and soak-up this magnificent art form of symbolic and superstitious embellishment. Atmospheric, old fashion chills of the subtle, but still blood-curdling kind fill Herzog's stunningly protracted direction. The story is there, but it's the little details that sets this canvas in motion. The gloomy tone of the film is powerfully brooding from the air of growing despair, loneliness to the smothering stench of dark, lingering death. Kiniski sensationally emit's a sullen, heart-felt turn where he's shadowy exterior creeps up upon you and causes goose bumps. His make-up and body movement is simply trance-like, and stares you down. He's a scavenger, which goes after what he wants and not under any sort seductive appeal. A soulful Adjani is awe-inspiring, and gracefully evokes a versatile performance that also demands your attention. A quite dry Bruno Gaz does well, and an unforgettable Roland Topor as Dracula's loyal servant totally cackles like an on edge hyena. Picturesque cinematography with unique camera-shots, and a forlornly dreamy orchestral music score set the tone. I pretty much agree with others when they say it's a hard one to put into clear and concise words. Just see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty fine go at "Dracula"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Herzog adaptation of the Dracula story, filtered through the memory in particular of Murnau's "Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horrors", is largely a successful film. It is great in parts and in aspects, but doesn't quite amount to a whole that approaches superlative status. Klaus Kinski is rather good, but not quite spellbinding, in the much-donned cape of the old Count. He is not quite up to the vastly contrasting interpretations I have seen - Schreck and Lugosi. Isabelle Adjani? Hers is far from a terrible performance, as one commentator has said; she is, indeed, reasonable in a role often lacking embellishment in other adaptations. Of course, her striking good looks are certainly far from unwelcome. The chap playing Renfield (the madman, so amusingly and vividly portrayed by Dwight Frye in the 1931 Universal "Dracula") is effective in portraying an outright giggling madman - his laugh is one of *the* most absurd and insane sounds I have heard in film...! The use of music is wonderful, as is Herzog's visual direction - the plague scenes leave quite an impression on the mind, and most scenes are accorded impressive backdrops and appropriate visual textures. Popol Vuh's musical textures are dreamily beguiling, setting just the right tone for Herzog's imagery. The film's downside has to be in the dramatics really; the dialogue and subsequent delivery of, are far from great, perhaps owing to the fact that most of the performers' native tongues are not English, and here they have to speak just that language. There is never quite enough dramatic tension induced by the script or the acting; at times the Renfield chap and Kinski are compelling, but only fitfully.Having said all this, it is a fine rendition on film of a rather old and, frankly, enduring story. Herzog must take the credit for its effective atmosphere, but perhaps also the blame for the lacking dramatics. Certainly an enjoyable, generally impressive film.Rating:- ****/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Herzog deserves hats off, any academy award for best director. A film so beautiful should be more well known. The atmosphere is stuck with you from the beginning with the chants and the screams. The characters fit the film perfectly, besides the librarian guy. The colors were great, the shots were planned out great. The simplicity of a shadow was made so mesmerizing. I felt chills all around my body after watching this film. It had a touch with all those shadows and the shot with the vampires hand going down. Not only the best vampire movie EVER but a fantastic film, period. All I can say is Herzog did a wonderful job with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just purchased this on DVD and its easily one of my favorite new disks. Included in the DVD masterpiece are: the English Version, the German Version with English subtitles, audio commentary by director Werner Herzog, 2 different US theatrical trailers, 1 Spanish theatrical trailer and even a making of the movie mini-feature!!! Very worth the money!!!This is not an average movie by any means!!! It also appears to be a salute to the great German Expressionist films of the early 1900's. The story line is very intelligent and compassionate. The dialogue is spoken very soft and slowly. There is not very much action in the film, but the performances and cinematography are nothing short of breathtaking!!Klaus Kinski plays a very convincing Dracula in this 1979 classic. His slow movements are almost hypnotizing!!! Just watch how he moves his hands!! They move so slow and very mysterious!! The guy who played the "nut case" was great!! The images of coffins, crucifixes, rats, and how rumors of the plague were spreading were brilliantly executed.If you liked this film, you might want to check out 1992's "The Cronos" for another example of a compassionate and intelligent story about Vampires, but set in Mexico. Both films explore the "humanistic" internal conflict in vampires.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Herzog's Homage to Murnau</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fitzcarraldo" director Werner Herzog "Nosferatu the Vampyre" pays tribute to F.W. Murnau's classic chiller, but this 107-minute, color masterpiece departs from the original in several respects. Essentially, the narrative doesn't deviate drastically until the second half after Count Dracula bids the ruins of his castle farewell and travels by ship to Varna. Of course, the names have been changed since Herzog didn't have to worry about the issue of copyright infringement. Although "Nosferatu the Vampyre" ranks as a brilliant film and a reverential remake, Herzog's production creeps along at a glacial pace, but the sets are for the most part genuine. Produced for under a million dollars, this atmospheric chiller doesn't generate the degree of horror that the Hammer "Dracula" franchise or even the Universal franchise boasted. Indeed, the film remains virtually bloodless. You aren't going to suffer nightmares from watching this painstakingly lensed film.Unlike the traditional Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee Dracula, the eponymous villain here is a hideous Dracula. He is bald, cadaverous, with long fingernails and two viper-like fangs at the front of his mouth. Mind you, Klaus Kinski delivers a spellbinding performance, but he doesn't eclipse the portrait of pestilent evil that Max Schreck exuded in the unforgettable 1922 silent film. Nevertheless, Kinski's Dracula differs in more respects from the Schreck incarnation. Schreck epitomized unadulterated evil, while Kinski evokes a measure of sympathy. The Kinski vampire qualifies as a post-modern vampire because he emerges as a hopelessly tragic figure. At one point in the subtitled German language version, the Kinski Dracula confides in the heroine that "Cruel is when you can't die even if you want to die." Like the Murnau original, vampires are susceptible to the damning rays of sunlight. Unlike the Schreck vampire, Kinski's vampire doesn't dissolve when the sunlight strikes him. He plunges into convulsions and wallows around on the floor until Dr. Van Helsing hammers a stake into him.The major departures in "Nosferatu the Vampyre" occur after Dracula forsakes his castle. The scenes aboard the ship remain intact with the crew dying, but you don't see anybody diving off the ship. Whereas Murnau showed several rats in his film, Herzog displays no restrain. He bought eleven-thousand white rats from a laboratory and painted them gray. According to Herzog on the Anchor Bay commentary track, the production company didn't lose a single rodent, but the sight of the rats made a customs official faint. Furthermore, Herzog took elaborate precautions on the set to ensure that none of the rodents escaped. The co-commentator observed that Herzog also neutered the rats so none could reproduce. Not since either version of "Willard" have so many rats appeared on camera. One striking scene involving the rodents occurs toward the end of the story. A group of plague-infected friends attempt to prolong their happiness by dining on one final meal before they die. They are surrounded by literally hundreds of rats. Murnau's film cannot compete with the vast horde of rats that Herzog used. If the sight of rats is terrifying, you might have a problem with this film.Bruno Ganz doesn't play Jonathan Harker with the same gusto that Gustav von Wangenheim imbued Hutter with in the silent epic. Harker travels to the remote mountains of Transylvania on a mission similar to Hutter's. Indeed, Renfield (Roland Topor) dispatches him with the same promise that he might lose some blood. Harker slices his thumb up while carving bread during his dinner, and Count Dracula assaults him. Far away, Lucy Harker (Isabelle Adjani of "The Story of Adele H") reacts to the vampire's attack on her husband. Later, Harker watches as Dracula loads up coffins (more than Schreck loaded) and departs from the castle by a horse-drawn wagon. Interestingly enough, Ganz's Harker has to walk on foot from the inn, where he rode by horse, to reach the rendezvous point with Count Dracula's carriage. More importantly, Harker is bitten by Dracula, escapes from the castle, spends time in a church hospital, but returns to Varna. Unlike Hutter, Harker is slowly turning into a vampire.At this point, the character of Lucy assumes greater significance than her counterpart in the Murnau film. Isabelle Adjani's Lucy is a real combatant. She has a scene in her bedroom where she confronts Dracula and spurns him. Of course, she is wearing a crucifix, but she makes it blatantly clear that she wants nothing to do with him. She claims that she is prepared to spurn the Lord, too. After Harker returns but fails to recognize her, Lucy dredges up the book of vampires from his belongings and reads about the fiends. She approaches Dr. Van Helsing, but he dismisses her warnings about the real plague in the town. When Mina (Martje Grohmann) dies, the town officials say that she died from the plague. Herzog doesn't have a drum-beating official reading a warning to the town. Instead, he shows black-clad, top-hatted officials carrying coffins on their shoulders by the dozens. Anyway, Lucy exemplifies female empowerment. She crumbles up sacred crackers to keep her husband at bay and seduces the unwitting Dracula so that he will sup from her neck and forget about the dawn that destroys him.Herzog doesn't rely on any special effects in his version of "Dracula." All the effects were produced in camera. The scene when Dracula entered Lucy's bedroom while she stared into the mirror and watched the door swing open and a shadow appear is an example. Indeed, Herzog made the most of his budget. This period piece is steeped in atmosphere. "Nosferatu the Vampyre" isn't a scary movie. It amounts to more of a literary exercise. The environment creates a genuine sense of dread as does Herzog's use of the original music by Popol Vuh. Herzog does some amazing things with his camera, and he doesn't rely on the usual snap editing so that "Nosferatu the Vampyre" is a film of remarkable cohesion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While Not Quite as Masterful as the Original, Herzog's Remake is Still Nothing Short of Masterful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot is nothing new, as it differs negligibly from the original 1922 film which itself differed negligibly from Stoker's 1897 novel. Harker (Bruno Ganz) is sent by his employer, Renfield (Roland Topor), to Transylvania in order to finalize the the sale of a large estate to Count Dracula (Klaus Kinski). While housed in the count's ruined castle, it becomes evident that he is actually a prisoner by a blood-sucking fiend and makes his escape. Now, turning himself into a vampire, he must return to Germany and warn his wife Lucy (Isabelle Adjani) of the vampire that now stalks her.The truly remarkable thing about this film is that it doesn't fall into the typical trappings of remakes. That is, it doesn't become a slave to the original installment (ie, 1998's "Psycho") while at the same time not straying to drastically from it (ie, 2008's "The Day the Earth Stood Still"). At the same time, it doesn't manage to lose the "soul of the film" by simply going through the artistic motions (ie, "Let Me In"). Instead, it joins of class of exceptionally well-crafted modern remakes, including 2004's "Dawn of the Dead," 2006's "The Departed" and 2010's "The Crazies" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street." Kinski's Dracula is a notably divergence from Shreck's Orlok. The monstrous inhumanity that characterize Shreck's vampire has given way to a more modern romanticization of the character. He's of the same brood as Louis de Pointe du Lac (the protagonist from "Interview with the Vampire"). He's a sad, (sym)pathetic killer who reviles his monstrous existence while fearing death far too much to change his ways. While Orlok lusted after Ellen with rabid appetite, this Dracula longs for her love. When he states that living and being unable to die is a cruelly fate than death itself, you believe him.While the first half of the moving (the parts spent getting to, set in and leaving Transylvania) lack the same unnerving intensity as this film's antecedent, the second half (the parts spent in Germany after the count's arrival) are significantly better. While in the first film it was possible to imagine that the plague was merely a clever ruse to allow Orlok to feed on the populace at his leisure, Herzog's film leaves no doubt in the viewer's mind (one genuinely off-setting scene features an entire street is crowded with funeral processions).From Ellen to Lucy, the female protagonist has completed a remarkable strengthening of character. In the original film, her excessive pining for Hutter threatened her health and, while she managed to trick Orlok into death, did so passively. In the remake she has become a strong, resolute woman who commands the attention of her husband (rather than his dismissive chiding), resists the temptations of the vampire, vigilantly guards her turning husband and pro-actively traps Dracula. Unlike 1990's remake of "Night of the Living Dead" (which featured a similar transformation in Barbara), Herzog didn't go overboard and make her the second (or, rather, first) coming of Sarah Connor.Fans of vampires (particular the original 1922 film or the various incarnations of Dracula), horror and Herzog will find this an exceptional remake of the 1922 classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nosferatu lives again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nosferatu is still the best horror film ever made. It's still atmospheric and creepy even after 80 some years. Herzog is one of the finest directors who ever lived and he creates a film that holds a candle to Murnau's brilliance.Can Phantom Der Nacht beat the original 1922 classic? Well I don't think we should debate whether it can beat it, Herzog never intended to remake Nosferatu for debate.What I do like about Herzog's picture is that he recognized that there was room for improvement. Our Count is given more human tendencies instead of Orlock being a rat like character. Klaus Kinski's portrayal of the Count makes him sad. The relationship between Dracula and Lucy adds sexual tension to the story that actually works unlike other vampire films.Much of the praise must go to Klaus Kinski. His Dracula is absolutely brilliant. He obviously did his homework because he has captured Orlock's mannerisms to the point where it is uncanny. His voice isn't powerful or sexy but it in the end it really shouldn't be, at least not for this interpretation of the character.Bruno Ganz is one of the world's most versatile actors and he gives a great performance as Jonathon. The shocker ending wouldn't have had the effect it had, if Ganz hadn't successfully mimic ed Kinski.But the key to the film is Herzog. The atmosphere for Nosferatu is brilliance. Herzog understands that the vampire film must exist in a state where the rules of reality don't apply. His Nosferatu takes place in a dream like world which makes the film all the more frightening.One last note. PLEASE VIEW THE MOVIE IN IT'S ORIGINAL TONGUE. The performances are much much stronger that way,particularly Kinski the key player</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am fascinated by the vampire legend. It is a rich vein for artists to draw upon. The first vampire film, and quite possibly the best, is Murnau's Nosferatu. Bram Stoker's Dracula is laid before us in all but name. But the stunning visual imagery of Murnau's Expressionist film has not been taken up by other film-makers doing their versions of the Count. Except here. Herzog is clearly doing a re-make of Murnau's film rather than another vampire/Dracula interpretation.As such Herzog concentrates on the visual. Dialogue is reduced - simple lines that would look good on a silent film dialogue card. Mood and atmosphere and pace are the key elements he is exploring. The effect is much like a minor classical piece of music or a Dutch landscape painting. There is much to admire but little to excite - and flaws are obvious.Some scenes are stunning - the ship docking by itself with the dead captain tied to the wheel; Lucy's view through the mirror of the shadow of the count arriving in her bedroom; lines of coffins moving slowly through the streets of Wismar. Yet, despite these moments of visual splendor, and an interesting performance of the fingers by Kinski, this film does invite comparison with the original and fails badly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the very best for the Count</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe that this picture is one of the best vampire movies. As a fan of Lugosi's version and some of the earlier Christopher Lee pieces, I cannot stand most post- 1978 vampire flicks. Nowadays, there is too much blood and gore, schlock horror. Most vampire films today portray the vampire as a super powerful and inhuman monster. I like vampires like Barnabas Collins, who is evil but has a conscience and a complex character. Summary: Harker is sent by an already-insane Renfield from Wismar, Germany to Transylvania. Count Dracula wishes to finalize the transaction for a Wismar residence in person, with an agent. Drucula looks like a monstrous corpse- he lacks the continental charm and physical beauty of many other Dracula characters. He is a haunted creature- more sympathetic than evil. After biting Harker, Dracula sails for Germany. When the Count lands, the black death follows the rats in the hold. Slowly, vapirism and the plague kill off most of Wismar. Lucy Harker (Mina is Jon Harker's sister in this version) sacrifices herself so that Dracula is exposed to fatal sunlight. (In the novel and in Lugosi's Dracula, sunlight weakens the Count but does not kill him.) Van Helsing is portrayed as a typical 19th century positivist doctor who has to be dragged "kicking and screaming" by Lucy to the realities of Dracula. This version is based more on the 1922 movie than on the novel, and it fits in well with the Blue Oyster Cult's song Nosferatu. The Count is called Dracula (Ich bin Graf Dracuala) but is similar to Graf Orlock of the 1922 movie. I have seen German, English, and Spanish versions: nothing is lost in translation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If anybody ever founds a Vampire Museum (and who knows, somebody somewhere probably already has), it would be unjust to devote anything less than a wing to Werner Herzog's "Nosferatu," one of the most stunningly beautiful 'horror' films I've ever seen. While I place 'horror' in quotes, it is not because of a default urge to pigeonhole something into a genre to which it barely qualifies--no, it's because "Nosferatu" is like watching an exquisite painting magically put in motion. There is fear and eerie atmosphere aplenty (much of which is provided by a recurring classical music cue), mixed with a rat fixation that becomes oddly symbolic. Unlike F.W. Murnau's 1922 version, this 1979 remake is as much about the existential despair of the undead condition rather than simply the plight of a blood-sucking vampire; while many scenes are recreated shot-for-shot, Herzog is no plagiarist, and actually improves on many of the technical shortcomings that hindered Murnau's film decades before ('night' no longer looks like mid-day, for instance). The film's supernatural love triangle remains intact, and again hinges on Lucy Harker (Isabelle Adjani), who steals the movie from the none-too-modest talents of Klaus Kinski (Count Dracula) and Bruno Ganz (Jonathan Harker). While some may find it slow and ponderous, this "Nosferatu" is one of the best vampire films ever made (besting even Murnau's version), a moody character piece with visual ingenuity to spare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cinematic Nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Werner Herzog found the stuff dreams are made of, and discovered a means of channeling it through his camera to weave a glorious tapestry of romanticism and expressionism. Watch the beautiful landscapes as they unfold during Harker's ride to Transylvania, or the brilliant use of the lighting and frame composition as Dracula walks down a barely illuminated corridor to emerge in Harker's room, or even how the actors express more in gestures and looks than with their words. Nosferatu evokes the spirit of its silent predecessor, yet it's in color and features sound. I felt like I was watching a film unlike any other ? one that exists somewhere between the silent films of cinema's past and the modern films of cinema's future. A film that exists in the surreal place between dreams and memory. Interestingly, I had a number of complaints from the very beginning of the film ? I didn't particularly care for Isabelle Adjani in the role of Lucy, and there were a number of extremely subtle details regarding the city locations that bothered me (not worth the space to detail them). Then as the film progressed, my complaints continued to resonate, however, they did not grow and fester into something I despised. Instead, they evoked this strange sense of dissonance ? like the intentional chilling chords of a Bernard Herrmann score meant to put the listener on the edge of their seats ? which worked into the film's favor and enhanced that surreal nightmare feel.In the end, when the inevitable task of stopping Dracula falls upon her shoulders, I accepted Isabelle Adjani in the role of Lucy, and honestly I can't see the film working the way it did without her. So complaint turns to praise. And Klaus Kinski in the role of Dracula ? following after Max Shreck in the original is no light task. I love how the deformed Dracula with bat-like ears, bat-like fangs, and elongated fingers is played so quietly, so timidly, so understated in the dialogue scenes where he speaks on the misery and tragedy of immortality, juxtapose to his violent blood lust where he overturns a chair and backs Harker across the room. Then later on, the look of disgust upon his face as he dismissively orders the insane Renfield to carry out his mission. There's something to be said of the Nosferatu renditions of Dracula, himself, that is noticeably lacking from the others that portray the infamous count as a handsome, charming, yet noticeably strange man. It has been observed and written that vampires are largely sexual creatures (particular in the many variations of the Dracula story) in how filmmakers treat the drinking of another person's blood as an intimate, sometimes even euphoric, exchange. A bonding of blood, a bonding of souls, and an unnatural consummation of love. Even in other mediums, vampires are portrayed as the more elegant and more seductive creatures that haunt the night.It's fascinating how Nosferatu heightens this sensation through Dracula's grotesque appearance and through the hints of a torn and timid soul heard in his quiet voice. He's a despairing creature longing to be given what cannot be taken, a creature forced to live with his appearance, with his curse, and the death he brings. Nosferatu, more than any other version of Dracula, shows the sad and hopeless existence in this creature of darkness destined to die as a direct result of his own desire. There is no bright side to his curse, there is no elegance, nor grace. He's a monster, he'll always be a monster, and he knows it. The curse of vampirism finally portrayed as a curse.The tension from the film's finale is masterfully achieved by pitting our sympathies of Dracula against our sympathies for Lucy and all those who will die if the count lives. A small part of our subconscious wants Dracula to escape, but at the same time we're consciously hoping Lucy can keep him from remembering the dawn and do so without sacrificing herself completely. The climax of the film does not involve a massive battle with the hero and the monster, rather, it's the more subtle seduction through the consumption of the life blood.Likewise the film doesn't play so much to our sense of excitement and adventure or even to our intellectual logic, rather it intrigues us with its seductive dreamlike reality created through the techniques of cinema. For example, through wonderful use of suggestion and shadows it's revealed that Dracula has broken into Lucy's room. When the vampire appears in frame with her, Lucy doesn't look on with shock or surprise, she doesn't react the way we expect her to. Rather she looks on as though she already knows who he is, that she's not terribly surprised to see him. Then Dracula meekly states, "please forgive my rudeness" and from there they converse (albeit with tension lingering in their voices). In closing, Nosferatu is more concerned with what it can show than what it can explain. It plays like a nightmare, and thus I feel it's only appropriate to close by quoting one of the most authoritative individual when it comes to nightmares within art. "Is all that we see or seem/but a dream within a dream?" (Edgar Allan Poe.)</fullReview>

Filmed in 1926 the movie baffled audiences for generations. Although at times over acted at moments the music goes along perfectly with the mood of the scenes. The lighting was amazing for the first true horror film ever produced. The legendary shot of the count walking though the Gothic door will stick in the back of you mind days after seeing the film. The sight of the dead Capitan on the boat will send a shiver up you spine as you know that he was sucked dry helplessly on his own ship.

		<fullReview>With the exception of the television show Dark Shadows, George A.

However, Werner Herzog's 1979 film, "Nosferatu", is, in my opinion, the best vampire film ever made, next to the 1922 original "Nosferatu".Herzog's "Nosferatu" evokes strong images, feelings, and moods in a subtle, but stirring way. There's no glitz, no glamour, or romanticism. The film is eerie, ugly, beautiful, strongly visual, at times scary, and always completely compelling. "Noseferatu" is a film that displays film artistry, but not film "artsiness". Well acted, well scored, well directed, and great cinematography, "Nosferatu" captures the true spirit of the myth known as the Vampyre.</fullReview>

Werner Herzog displays a keen eye for the macabre in this film, making the perfect homage to the old German Expressionist horror films. Consequently, the film is full of long sequences with no dialog and minimal sound. These work to the film's advantages, creating an off-kilter, nightmarish world.The masterful cinematography, Kinski's pitiful and loathsome presence as Count Dracula, and a haunting, primarily choral soundtrack by the avant-garde band Popol Vuh all contribute to make this film great.

		<shortDescription>Outstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Werner Herzog is an artist out of his time?.and that's a very good thing for lovers of great films. His own great 1979 film Nosferatu, Phantom Of The Night (Nosferatu, Phantom Der Nacht), which was released in America as Nosferatu, The Vampire, is less a classic vampire film and more a Post-Apocalyptic tale, having more in common (especially image-wise) with films like On The Beach, The Quiet Earth, the Vincent Price classic The Last Man On Earth (based on Richard Matheson's I Am Legend), and even the first Night Of The Living Dead, than with the Hollywood Dracula mythos, and even its silent filmic predecessor, Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau's 1922 classic Nosferatu, A Symphony of Horrors (Nosferatu, Eine Symphonie Des Grauens), because Herzog is a filmmaker not afraid to turn his camera eye on ugliness, and use that as a way to limn reality better and more clearly in his search for his own 'ecstatic truth.' Herzog has always specialized in eye level realism, wherein he generally eschews those glossy gorgeous postcard-like shots that many filmmakers often substitute for depth, and this results in his ability to push his stories forward without relying on obvious techniques, substituting elements that hit at a viewer's instinctual reactions rather than merely the intellectual. This comes from his great screenplays, such as this one, which are usually his own creations; albeit with a little help from the novel he adapted it from, Bram Stoker's Dracula.This 107 minute film melds the best parts of Murnau's classic film with the Dracula legendry we all know, yet is unlike either, nor any other vampire film ever made. The film is not a remake nor an homage, which it is usually lazily called, but an artistic vampire of a vampire of a vampire film, because, unlike the silent film, the Count is called Dracula, not Orlock, for by the time Herzog made his film Dracula had fallen into public domain. The original film weathered legal litigation for copyright infringement from the Stoker estate, but this film, part of the 1970s wave of New German Cinema (Das Neue Kino)- which were really the troika of Herzog, Wim Wenders, and Rainer Werner Fassbinder, is possibly that loose movement's height; although one might argue Herzog's own earlier masterpiece Aguirre: The Wrath Of God was its pinnacle. It was filmed in the Dutch town of Delft, in English, to satisfy American investors' demands for marketability in the United States, and then dubbed into German, with subtitles for other countries. Several of Herzog's films were done this way, including Aguirre and Fitzcarraldo?. The camera work by Jorg Schmidt-Reitwein is among the best in not only the Herzog canon, but in all of film. It is subdued, subtly shifts color palettes depending upon the mood of the lead characters, makes use of shadows the way the black and white classics of Carl Theodor Dreyer do, and has a colorful monochrome which dissonates the expectations of the viewer, much as the slow motion images of bats in flight- borrowed from a science documentary, do. The fact that the bat sequences are also drenched in a great film score only adds to the moments. Yet, this is Herzog at his best, whether stealing from himself- note the raft load of black coffins going down yet another river, or pioneering hand held shots in an age when they were eschewed, all to further the sense of the real, the vaunted eye level realism that shows the past as it was- dirty, grimy, and filled with generally pathetic souls, just as his earlier The Enigma Of Kaspar Hauser did. Yet Herzog never is heavyhanded in his use of artistic techniques. Look at the subversive symbolism in a shot of Dracula in the town square, when a ring of streetlamps in the background blur to form a diadem or halo about his pate. This can be interpreted several ways, but the interpretation is not as important as the very boldness such a shot entails. Or note how emotional scenes are never displayed closeup, as in Hollywood tearjerkers, but from a distance, and usually shot from behind the actors- a technique Herzog manifestly borrowed from Ingmar Bergman. He also allows the viewer to fill in narrative interstices with what is known from the Dracula mythos, thereby focusing on character- not horror, which is immanent in all vampire tales. This allows him to throw in narrative dissonances and unexpected moments, such as Dracula's clock chiming at midnight, or the appearance of a strangely deformed dwarf man to arrest Van Helsing, yet having no legal authority nor knowledge nor power to do so. Both of these moments are absurd, but horrible in the most existential sense. Their absurdity and displacement from conventions foster a feeling of illogic that gnaws at a viewer who cannot grasp why, thus making its unknown provenance another bit of horror.Also, consider the film's end, where Lucy sacrifices herself in vain, becoming a vampire of the vampire by passively, then actively, soliciting his feeding upon her neck. Only Herzog could make a death-obsessed seductress out of a victim. In all of the films of his, I have never witnessed a single clichd nor trite scene, image, nor even moment. This fact lifts Herzog not only into the top rank of filmmakers, but of artists of all time, alongside Shakespeare, Beethoven, Mozart, and Picasso. His great film is one of the finest character studies of a wholly fictive character ever filmed, for it first deconstructs, then reconstructs, then recontextualizes the whole mythos from the fairy tale horror many critics see Dracula as embodying, to a symbol of the worst of humanity- not its evil, but its cowardice and inaction. Only Lucy takes action, but because of her being alone in doing so she is doomed, as might be the whole world that Jonathan Harker rides away to infect. Sadly, I know what Lucy feels. Thanks, Werner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Dracula tale told by a master filmmaker whose artistic visual eye is on display. I was transfixed with this film from the moment it begins until the final frame darkens. I can not put into words what thrill overcome me as I watched in awe this film. There's a scene where Isabelle Adjani's Lucy meets the vampire for the very first time, and the way Herzog introduces him to her was as if Dracula's shadow opened the door! I was so mesmerized by Kinski's performance(..and, especially how Herzog shoots him appearing from the dark..and the way Herzog lights his shadows against walls is just magnificent!), when he wasn't on screen I was chomping at the bit to see him. Such as the scenes in Dracula's Transylvania castle in the Carpathian Mountains. The agony behind each breath he takes. The way he snatched Harker's arm, sucking the blood from an accidental cut. The way he stares at Harker with this aching of melancholy..particularly when he speaks of the missing love not in his life. Listen to how Kinski delivers the words regarding death and the loneliness..it's spoken with such pain and agony. Then the later scenes where he approaches Harker like a predatory animal about to pounce(..especially the bed side scene, shortly after the stunning shot from Herzog displaying Dracula appearing from this darkened hall). Look how Herzog captures the absolute beauty of Adjani..has anyone ever photographed her quite like this? The guy that plays Renfield..where did Herzog dig this fellow up at?! The street sequences as the plague has ended almost an entire civilization with pigs and lambs walking around as rats join together in massive armies in corners and traveling in packs. The scenes where Bruno Ganz, as Harker, looks more and more like Dracula. One change in this than other versions is that Lucy is the one who motivates the destruction of Dracula, not Van Helsing. He's the kind that scoffs at the superstitions in favor of looking at the difficult situation(..regarding Dracula, and Lucy's suggestion to destroy him)scientifically. Lucy does what she has to do as in finding the killer responsible for the death and desolation taking place as the aristocracy celebrate their "last suppers" in the streets with rats awaiting their passing so they can partake in meal-time. I could go on and on because this is not just a film, but an experience. Herzog's use of music and how he photographs every single shot just stunned me to silence as I looked on in wonder and amazement. One of the single most pleasurable experiences I've encountered watching a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say that hasn't already been said about this masterpiece? The man, Herzog, knows how it's supposed to be done. He has the art perfected just like a master painter as da Vinci. This film is not just a film. It IS a visual treat for the eyes and not because of multi-million dollar cgi but because of this man's vision. What's the analogy here? There are cooks, and then there are chefs? There are piano players and then are there concert pianists? Herr Herzog is in full control and allows us the sheer honor and privilege to experience his masterful artistry.The "gimmick" at the time of release was that this was a scene for scene "remake" of the original 1922 film. But that's not true. It is an original interpretation of the Dracula story based upon the earlier film. Herr Herzog didn't merely retake scenes from the original and then add sound and dialog. He brought forth his vision of how a film in this genre should be made without having it look like a retread from another previous era in film making. That is the genius!This is a story that really never was told correctly before until Herr Herzog took hold of it. "Classic" is superfluous at this point. His film goes beyond that limiting term. One only has to watch the first five or ten minutes and then realize that this is nothing like you've seen before and that, unfortunately, 99% of the film makers today don't even attempt to make such films.Klaus Kinski is superb as the vampire! He also brings sensitivity and true artistry to a part that too many time over the last 84 years has been denigrated and essentially played for laughs, intentionally or unintentionally. Here, we see the essence of the vampire and exactly who he is and what he is. A seductive evilness personified. Watch this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Alternative Solution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this movie about twenty years ago, feeling scared by the sinister looks of Klaus Kinsky in this alternative interpretation of Bram Stoker's immortal novel.I have asked myself why Harker's wife's name is Lucy instead of Mina, or Wilhelmina, Harker, just like in the novel and in the other Dracula motion pictures. I say it is alternative because of Herzog's choices of names, location and plot, which swerves a bit from the original story. For instance, Wismar was never the city where Jonathan Harker and his fiance lived but rather London and the book certainly didn't portray Harker adventuring himself through the Carpatians on a horse. I must say though that it was entertaining, I dare say that its different plot structure was capturing, probably because I have seeing Christopher Lee and Gary Oldman playing as the Count, following Stoker's lines as much as possible.Photography was OK and music appropriate. Costumes were very realistic and, although I haven't seen Isabelle Adjani and Bruno Ganz act in any other movie, I feel at ease saying that they both played the "unusual" Harkers well. Let's keep in mind though that Nosferatu may not be understood well by viewers today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite Dracula film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I have a deep affection for F.W. Murnau's silent classic SUNRISE: A SONG OF TWO HUMANS (1927), I have to admit that I was bored silly by NOSFERATU (1922), his take on Bram Stoker's Dracula. However, since I greatly admired Bruno Ganz's magnificent performance of Adolf Hitler in DER UNTERGANG (2004), I happened to come across this 1979 remake costarring Ganz as Jonathan Harker. This film was shot simultaneously in German and English (for the American market) using the same actors. Since I prefer to see a film the way it was intended to be shown, I decided to watch the German version.This is my favorite Dracula film for a number of reasons. I'm not a fan of horror movies yet the film is very artistic. The film's cinematography is gorgeous, revealing breathtaking landscapes of the European countryside and its early 19th Century town life. The haunting music score is eerie and makes beautiful use of Richard Wagner's prelude to his opera DAS RHEINGOLD during two scenes. Werner Herzog's intelligent direction is hypnotic and dreamlike, to say the least?just don't expect any over-the-top action scenes, gobs o' gore, or "jump moments" as in so many current American horror movies. The atmosphere?which is the most important element of the film?is spooky and captures the film's setting well. You'll feel as though you're watching an early 19th Century European painting?a creepy and morbid yet strangely beautiful one?come to life.The familiar story works wonderfully well due to its originality and freshness. For example, the film takes place only in Central Europe and Dracula begins his reign of terror with the Black Death rather than just biting people. The German city of Wismar is substituted for London here. And Dr. Van Helsing is no vampire expert. However, the story doesn't really matter?the film's incomparable atmosphere and cinematography are the most important elements of the film.And did I mention the acting? Bruno Ganz plays Harker with quiet uneasiness and makes the audience believe that he is a prisoner of eerie circumstances in the strange land of Transylvania. French actress Isabelle Adjani makes a gorgeous and pensive Lucy, whose brunette looks are reminiscent of Austrian actress Hedy Lamarr. French actor Roland Topor steals the film as Renfield, delivering a delightful mad laugh throughout. And Klaus Kinski plays the hideous vampire with perfection, his miserable and pitiful character made complete with pale skin, creepy long fingernails, bald head, pointy ears, and ratty fangs. Kinski's Dracula is the stuff of nightmares.The film is best appreciated by true film lovers, and the film's best watching conditions are at night with the lights turned off and nobody else inside the room. Under these conditions you'll feel anxious during several scenes while watching and the film will haunt you for years after it is over. Just be patient while watching and you'll be rewarded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With the Friend Like Klaus....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fifty seven years after F.W. Murnau, Herzog resurrected the Dracula's legend with this film in which his favorite actor/best friend/worst enemy Klaus Kinski played the title role as a very tired, very quiet, very lonely Count Dracula who looked like he literally had not slept for centuries. The film is undeniably Herzog's and has many of his signature signs ? the stunning views, the slow deliberate pace, the eerie music, the dreamlike atmosphere, the admiration by the nature and its indifferent to the human's worries power and remote beauty; even the story of the ship with all crew members dead as the result of the horrible mystery. Breathtakingly beautiful Isabelle Adjani plays an object of Dracula's obsession and the contrast between his ugliness and her divine beauty is simply mesmerizing. In this film, the pure?hearted and brave woman takes it upon herself to face off the undead evil. By the time, Dr. Van Helsing arrives with the stake and hammer, his services are not required. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it is a remake. but not only. it is a vampire story. but far to common rules. in fact, it is a Herzog film. that is all. and each explanation becomes his Nosferatu is different by the rule. Kinski gives coldness and animal needs, darkness of feelings and embroidery of cynicism in a special manner. and, more than story, essential is the chain of landscapes. slow, like picture of a wax universe, it seems be box for a profound, great secret. the camera introduce the viewer behind the script and acting in a kind of fear and expectation.a movie like a Dutch embroidery. the Gipsies as oasis - nuance, the frame of dream and parable who remember Paradjanov work. cold poetry - that is the answer after its end. because it is just a question for each of its viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The tale of the Count, that icon of horror and grandfather to all modern bloodsuckers is so well known that reciting the plot of Bram Stoker's novel is like regurgitating history. The undead Hungarian that so many associate with flowing capes, decaying European aristocracy &amp; butchered Slavic accents is such a staple of pop culture that the terror of the original concept- a tortured nobleman who just want to purchase a little real estate for Christ's sake- has lost a lot of its power. Look no further than the rhyming vamp on Sesame St. to see how tired this is. It's only natural something so resonant and rich is relentlessly plundered and duplicated though. Once upon a time the arbitrary vivisection of oversexed teenagers at the hands of a masked madman was cause for gasps, not ironic winking.It takes talent to bring new perspectives to dated material and even as early as 1979 the Count was looking long in tooth. It took German director Werner Herzog to restore the mythos with the sense of dignity it once commanded, a re-invention of the silent B&amp;W classic NOSFERATU, itself an unofficial adaption of the book. That film was a catalogue of indelible images in its own right, orchestrated by silent film pioneer F.W. Murnau. Is there a more memorable image in all of horror filmdom than Count 'Orlock' climbing a dark stairway, distinctive silhouette vividly imprinted on the retina of your mind's eye, all grasping claws and hunched back like some creepy-crawly unleashed from our deepest, darkest nightmares? Herzog is too respectful to try a retread though, this is more homage than shot-by-shot remake, reminding us of its debt to its sire while forging its own unique signature.NOSFERATU '79 is a direct antithesis to all the over-cut, MTV emo-youth vamp flicks. Its so damned uncommercial most would lack the patience to see it through. That'd be a shame because she's such a monument of unease, a tribute to disquiet so methodical in pacing and detail that you aren't even aware of being under its peculiar spell until its long over and you have time to ponder the fever dream just witnessed.Even the opening credits are some of the creepiest ever, lingering hand-held shots of mummified corpses leaning on a cave wall, all toothy grins &amp; beef jerky flesh, the music swelling in a wordless choral hymn (the sublime Popul Vuh). No explanation is offered for this opener, let your imagination fill in the blanks. Again &amp; again the film works like this, especially Harker's (Bruno Ganz) wordless, lonely trek through the Borgo pass, transversing river &amp; mountainside as more ominous sounds plug away, amounting to almost 10 minutes of running time in which virtually nothing happens except that delicious sense of building menace. Leaving behind familiar stomping grounds for something arcane and off limits.... Once you get into movie's groove, this stuff actually feels too brief. Those not bored out of their skulls will be panting for more of the nightmare travelogue. When the titular character finally graces the screen, it's almost disappointing. A big plus that Klaus Kinski's Count is a captivating one; a creature that comes off more pathetic &amp; weary than malevolent, his wretched, rat-like visage contradicting the suave sinister nobleman and plastic GQ model teenagers we've come to expect lately. Every line uttered by Herzog's temperamental muse sounds like its coming from a century's distance, as if even speaking now is an effort for the Count. Just like Ann Rice did, NOSFERATU groks true immortality as anything but a gift, closer to a one way ticket to a padded cell. Most vamp movies revel in some sort of undead, 'live fast die young leave a pretty corpse' chic (a huge effigy of Jim Morrison in THE LOST BOYS in fact captures this mentality of debased worship perfectly). Here our resident bloodsucker prances about like a one-man tragedy. Living forever is a bitch, no bones about it: ageless freak hood in a world of shadows &amp; ashes where everything burns but you? Alienation doesn't begin to describe it. What little dialogue there is functions like background noise, failing to propel like the images do. Other than Dracula there's nary a memorable line to be had, the chatter is perfunctory and distanced. Everyone here is like ghosts to start; this version too could function without speech, just imagery &amp; music to carry you along its dark waters, the actors relying on exaggerated movements to convey emotion. Herzog exploits modern techniques like sound &amp; color whilst still hearkening back to a low-fi past in honor of the original. It results in real poetry (if you can stomach restraint verging on vice-like). Without having to scrutinize the plot though the you're in a better position to admire the subtle, dream-like atmosphere conjured without keeping up with story.The empty cargo ship dispensing armies of vermin, the funeral progression of plague struck Wismar, the last supper held in the city square as thousands of rats congregate between the diner's feet- you could watch the German language version &amp; be no less captivated. The language of fear is universal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good faithful remake of the 1922 original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's basically impossible to remake a popular movie from the 1920's. The style of film-making used back then is so much different from the style of film-making that we are accustomed to now days and of course no sound or color got used. So how do you remake a movie from that time period faithfully, with keeping the same style and atmosphere and at the same time giving it a bit of a modern update as well for todays audience. Werner Herzog succeeded in this with "Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht", which is a remake of the other German classic movie "Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens", by F.W. Murnau.It sounds like a weird and stupid idea to remake the 1922 "Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens" in the first place, not because it uses a very distinctive and old fashioned style of film-making but also because it was the first ever telling of the Bram Stoker Dracula story, that wasn't even an official one, due to copyright reasons. Therefore "Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens" was a movie that didn't used any of the names from the novel, so there were no Dracula, Renfield or Van Helsing ever present in that movie. It would therefore make much more sense to simply make a Dracula version of the novel on your own, like they did countless times over the years. Werner Herzog however picked the hard road and decided to give his take on the F.W. Murnau classic. He simply changed the names back to the original ones from the novel but in basically ever other aspect he remained very loyal to the 1922 interpretation of the novel. In other words a great and effective modern update. Those who have seen the 1922 original will surely recognize some of the sequences within this movie. It uses some of the same set-ups and also the looks of the characters have changed very little. The count is still the most monstrous and ugly looking one and hardly the charming seducer that most people recognize him as in the American and other Hollywoodized interpretations of the story.Klaus Kinski plays the character very much Max Schreck style, with as an only difference that he speaks out some dialog as well. But above all it's still a movie that is all about its visuals and atmosphere and in that essence the movie remains mostly faithful to the original.It was still a bit weird though for me seeing this movie taking obviously place in the Netherlands for most of the time. It has nothing to do with the story and it probably got shot here for budgeting reasons and the facts that it was more authentically old and English-like looking than any German towns, of which some also mostly got destroyed for most part during WW II and rebuild with a more modern day look. As a result of that fact that the movie for most part got shot in the Netherlands, also a lot of quite well known Dutch actors show up in this, for all some very small roles.A great movie to watch, especially if you have also seen the 1922 original.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How do you remake one of the most historic films your country ever produced?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht, Werner Herzog replies firmly "by making it your own". Undertaking not only his first genre film in a career rich enough already by 1979 to earn Herzog a place among the most prolific German directors, but also a film with so much baggage, historical, stylistic or otherwise. Not only a retelling essentially of Bram Stocker's Dracula story but also a reimagining an expressionist universe defined by Herzog's cinematic forefathers (FW Murnau a key figure among them). In that aspect, Noferatu is one of the loftier, most ambitious and trickiest films Herzog tackled in a career already filled with them.Anyone who comes to this with a previous experience of Herzog's style will realize that the German infant terrible has made the material unmistakeably his. Like most of his films, Noferatu is like a film about a dream about a documentary depicting weird people doing weird things - yet, beneath the minimalism of the plot and the docu-style naturalism of his photography, the movie resonates with the kind of hypnotic power Coppola missed in the alchemical migraine of his '92 version. Filming a medieval German town swept by plague like a grotesque carnival complete with people dancing with goats on tables and having a feast in the middle of a swarm of mice, Herzog goes on to choreograph a heavily made-up Klaus Kinski (looking like a rodent and playing a theatric version of his real half-mad self) through the steps Max Schreck's character took on the deck of the ship in the original movie as though he wants to prove that he can make it look every bit as creepy as Murnau did.Perhaps reflecting the original in this department, Herzog's Nosferatu is still a pretty uneven film. Parts of it work better than others. When Kinski makes a grand appearance seething malice and despair, the screen is on fire. Grand antics work really well for this kind of character and this kind of movie. Bruno Ganz and Isabelle Adjani have enough charisma to carry the rest of the movie but the story structure occasionally betrays them. When Herzog cuts to Renfield's parts, you can feel the movie loosing steam with every gleeful cackle. When he cuts back to some kind of devilment going on, or even better the surreal stylizations of a bat flying in slow-motion set to Popol Vuh's repetitive drones, the movie comes closer to hitting the right emotional notes. When it achieves that kind of hypnotic, nightmarish vibe, the movie is great; when it doesn't, it's not bad.And lastly, even though I understand Herzog's dislike for formalism, is there any particular reason why 90% of the movie is shot from eye-level? Makes one wish for the extreme skewed angles of Japanese New Wave directors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific version of a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Werner Herzog's adaptation of F.W. Murnau's silent classic Nosferatu. It's easily one of the best film remakes I have seen.Nosferatu the Vampyre is tragic, mysterious and surreal. It merges beauty and horror. The pace is deliberate. Emphasis is put on atmosphere and, as Herzog did in Aguirre and Fitzcarraldo, a great deal of importance is invested in capturing the setting. The landscape is almost a character itself.Perhaps unsurprisingly from a film that takes its source from a silent classic, Nosferatu the Vampyre derives its strength through its images not its dramatics. The dialogue is fairly sparse and exposition scenes are brief and to the point. The movie is, however, a visual tour de force. Right from the offset we are presented with close-up shots of mummies followed by the recurring slow motion bat dream. From hereon in Herzog presents the viewer with a variety of striking images ranging from sweeping shots of a sailing ship to shaky hand-held close-ups of dancing plague victims, there are haunting shots of mountain landscape, majestic rivers and hordes of rats. In homage to the original, shadows are also presented very artistically. The hypnotic score from Popul Vuh is also well worth mentioning. Its sinister dreamlike ambiance is perfect here.As Herzog/Kinski collaborations go, this is arguably the best. Like the others it is a period piece that effectively uses indigenous non-actors, in this case gypsies, alongside the mercurial leading man. Although, acting-wise, the film belongs to Klaus Kinski; he delivers a subhuman rat-like performance that ranks alongside Max Shreck in the original. Kinski's count, however, is a haunted, tragic figure. A victim and reluctant predator trapped by his irrepressible killer instinct ? 'the hunter'. He is still a ruthless killer but he derives very little satisfaction from it. He is a far-cry from the suave aristocrat seen in most Dracula films. It's an excellent portrayal from one of the great European actors. The lack of dramatics doesn't allow for anyone else in the picture to really stand out, although Isabelle Adjani does well with the role she has and is in possession of an ethereal beauty that is perfect for her character.This is one of the very few remakes that stands proudly alongside the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slow, poetic film of death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A vampire story set in Germany with no horror scenes and minimum use of blood. Sounds like a bad film? Well, it might have been, if directed by anyone else than Werner Herzog, the director of magnificent psychological-historical film "Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes" (1972). Herzog considered F. W. Murnau's 1922 silent film "Nosferatu", an unofficial silent adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel "Dracula", to be the most important film ever made in Germany and wanted to do his own version of it. This film, "Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht" (1979), is in many ways more of a new version of Murnau's original silent classic, instead of Stoker's novel. However, unlike in original Nosferatu, this film does keep the original names of the characters. In the title role Herzog hired his most beloved enemy; Klaus Kinski, with whom Herzog had worked in Aguirre.The story is mainly a replay of the original Nosferatu. In 1830's Germany, Jonathan Harker (Bruno Ganz) receives an important job from his eccentric boss Renfield (Roland Topor) and travels to Transylvania to meet a strange noble man Graf Dracula (Klaus Kinski). Meanwhile back in Germany, Jonathan's wife Lucy (Isabelle Adjani) feels the presence of an approaching death. In many places this film follows Murnau's original so accurately, that some viewers have wondered if the whole film should have been left unmade. However, while the original Nosferatu stands as a grandfather of all vampire films, Herzog's version is an almost poetic movie of death. It is very peacefully moving film, purposely avoiding any great horror scenes and thunderous music that makes adrenaline run.So if you're looking for a film with lots of blood, gore, sexy vampires and nudity, look from somewhere else. This is a film for those who can sit watching beautiful sceneries and listen to a soft music. The beautiful shots of Amsterdam's old town, as well as of Carpathian Mountains, gives the film a feeling of an old world, almost a dream like quality. This is only strengthen by Popol Vuh's music, that can change from folk-like music to an eerie ghost music.Like in most of their collaborations, while half of the movie's credits go to Herzog, the other half goes to the actor Klaus Kinski (who had appeared in Jess Franco's "El Conde Dracula" as Renfield). Kinski's portrayal of Dracula is not the usual charismatic European gentleman with a darker side in him. Wearing a very same looking make-up as Max Schreck did in original Nosferatu, this Dracula is a monstrous looking demon who couldn't seduce a woman no matter what. However, Kinski doesn't play him as a monster, but as a tired creature, wary of eternal life and eternal loneliness. He longs to have things humans take granted, but he can only take them by force for no one will give them to him. Kinski is the most unfaithful Dracula to Bram Stoker's novel, but also makes an interesting character of him. Adjani and Ganz make good supporting roles also, but can't help but being overshadowed by Kinski.Werner Herzog's version of Nosferatu is not for every ones liking, but it is a beautifully shot film of death and terror. The actual horror is born from Lucy's desperation and determination to stop the vampire before it's too late and save what little there is left of her peaceful life. This is a film for those who have enjoyed other works of Herzog or Carl Dreyer's 1931 film "Vampyr", which is closest vampire film to this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Werner Herzog has a wonderful way of working with images, the film is a true masterpiece, a feast to the eye. It is also quite true to the book "Dracula" by Bram Stoker, at least in the beginning, the scenery gives you very much the same feel as the description of it in the book. Later the movie turns in to its own work of art, the story changes from Stoker's man above nature, new era conquering old-scenario into the more interesting theme where man is a very small part of the creation and a persons deeds can be either all-important or completely wasted in the greater perspective. This is not a horror movie, at least not in the American sense...it is a movie about humanity and its worth, of what me might become, or are already. Good and bad. Oh, and need I even mention that the truly GREAT Klaus Kinski is as per usual epochal in his interpretation of the anemic count...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful film about ugliness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Werner Herzog is a hard filmmaker to pin down. Not overtly political, like many of his contemporaries in the New German Cinema, it is also difficult to figure out what exactly Herzog's films are about, other than what we see on the surface. Actually, Herzog's films are so ravishingly poetic, so mysterious and awe inspiring, that we know they must be about more that what we are seeing on screen, even though he gives us very few overt clues as to what his message is. To me this makes him a very intriguing director. Of course not every one holds my opinion, many people, including friends and other people I respect, have criticized Herzog as self indulgent and/or regressive. I understand how they could see this, although I strongly disagree. However, this is not a gushing appreciation of Herzog or an attack on his critics. This is just a way for me to explore one of my favorite films, "? The Vampyre" and find out how it is way more than just the story of a lonely vampire looking for love.  Herzog's film is, of course, a remake of/homage to F.W Murnau's silent classic, "Nosferatu ? A Symphony of Terror". But where the first film is a simple (although beautifully told) tale of good versus evil, Herzog uses the first film as a springboard for a commentary on (among other things) the Expressionist and Romantic art movements. It is on this that I will focus my journal entry. The original film, although considered a milestone in Expressionist film making, actually contains relatively less expressionistic traits than most other works of art from the movement. One main feature of expressionistic art was the distortion of perspective, usually created through the use of clearly artificial sets. Murnau creates the feeling of distortion not through the sets, but through the way in which he films them, and the stylized acting.  Today's remakes of popular films are made to cash in on nostalgia, but Herzog's version of Nosferatu is like a class on the nature of expressionism, without actually being an expressionistic film. Visually it borrows much more from the romantic traditions of art, with its use of chiaroscuro lighting and use of deep, rolling landscapes. However, the presence of expressionism is felt throughout. Most obviously, Herzog quotes scenes from the original film, such as the classic low angle shot of Count Dracula standing on the hull of the ship. But unlike today's remakes of classic films, the quotations are more than just an attempt by Herzog to be hip, they are necessarily reminding us of the films origins. For Herzog, it is important for the audience (if even only subconsciously) consider his film as an essay on art.  Of course Herzog's comments on expressionism go much deeper than visual quotations. Even Herzog's use of locations could be read as some kind of reference to the situation of artists in the expressionist era. Herzog shot the film in Germany, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Holland, and even Mexico. Could this be a reference to the fact that many artists in the expressionist movement were affected by their feeling of being "locked in", of not feeling that Germany was an important part of the world scene? I'm of course not saying that Herzog went out of his way to film in these locations simply to make a point, but having read an awful lot of work by and about him, I wouldn't be surprised if he was aware of the connection.  I know I haven't yet suggested why Herzog chose to make this film a comment on the whole expressionist movement as opposed to a straightforward homage to Murnau. I believe that Herzog fells deeply indebted to the expressionism for they share many of the same themes as romanticism, such as loss and longing for the unattainable. Where the movements differ is in tone; romanticism is about the beauty of suffering, expressionism is about its ugliness. Herzog made a purposefully beautiful film about the ugliness that he believes is capable of unleashing itself in all of us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Werner Herzog Makes a Vampire Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht (1979) Some movies stick with you, for better or worse. I like it when it's for the better. Werner Herzog's 1979 version of the classic vampire tale, Nosferatu, is one of those films that has stuck with me. Thankfully it's been for the better. In fact, my appreciation has only continued to grow with time. It's one Herzog's more seen films, thanks to Kinski's reputation and the fact that most versions are in English, but in my opinion, it's one of his more overlooked and under-appreciated.Bram Stoker's Dracula has been adapted countless times, but only a few are really noteworthy. Probably the most widely seen is Coppola's 1992 version. It is not without merits. Gary Oldman is a fine actor, and does a good job with his version of the vampire, and Coppola flared the film up with an interesting visual style. The most respected and also well known version though is the first, FW Murnau's silent Nosferatu: eine Syphonie des Grauens. It reserves itself a spot on any film aficionado's must see list for Murnau's expressionist artistry. It was an assuredly constructed film with brilliant imagery and an unforgettable turn by the preternaturally creepy Max Schreck. Many will tell you that while having the highest respect for Murnau's film and its stunning achievements, they found it something of a dull affair. And I include myself in that category. There was also Todd Browning and Bela Lugosi's 1931 version, though it's perhaps more of a cult classic than an artistic masterpiece.And then in the wings is Herzog's version. It too is respected by those who've seen it, and is itself something of a cult classic. It stars the volatile Klaus Kinski, with whom Herzog made five films, including Aguirre:Wrath of God and Fitzcarraldo. Friend, documentarian, and the man who infamously won a bet which resulted in Herzog literally eating his own shoe, Errol Morris once referred to Kinski as a bonified "crazy person." That opinion, by most psychological standards, was probably correct. So if there was ever anyone to offer up a performance worthy of comparison to Schreck's original, it's Kinski.The story follows closely to Murnau's version. Bruno Ganz plays Jonathan Harker, who's called to deliver a real estate proposal to the Carpathian castle of Count Dracula. His wife Lucy is nervous of what may come and has strange dreams. His boss, Renfield is seemingly increasingly drifting further into excited insanity as Dracula's arrival draws nearer. Jonathan's trip to Count Dracula's castle is filled with tension and foreboding. He lodges for a night where he hears tales of a vampire and warnings, but continues on through the mountains. This act contains one of the film's most memorable sequences, set to Wagner's Prelude to Das Rheingold. It ends as a carriage mysteriously emerges from the fog to pick up Harker and carry him off to the castle.Count Dracula's castle is the epitome of ominous. The colour palette is lifeless, and of course in tribute to Murnau, shadows seem to take on a life of their own. Harker is greeted by Kinski's terrifying Dracula with uncomfortable courtesy. He searches the castle one day to find Dracula sleeping... in a casket.While Jonathan is incapacitated, Count Dracula makes his way to Wismar on a ship. Mysteriously to the crew, they're all dying off. The ship carries hoards of rats. Is it the plague the captain ponders? When the ship finally arrives, everyone on board is dead. Dracula emerges, with him the rats.To continue to harp on about the story is at this point an exercise in redundancy. We all essentially know what follows - Renfield is Dracula's minion, and the vampire is in love with Harker's wife, Lucy. Herzog changes things up a bit for the end, but it's Herzog and Kinski's execution that sets the film off. It has a terrifying strangeness. The locations are unforgettable - something to be expected from a man who famously declared that he directs landscapes. Delft (in Holland) served as Wismar. Its canals throughout the town are haunting, especially as the death ship squeezes its way through. The castle scenes are filmed at Castle Pernstejn, which I'm told still looks much like it did during filming.The film's opening sequence is of real life mummies in Mexico, which can still be visited. Another strange and surreal moment comes when Harker wakes up to a young boy playing violin above him. It's one of those great Herzog moments that seemingly serve no purpose other than as beautiful oddity. The film's creepiest sequence, and one of the most unforgettable and brilliant scenes I've ever seen, takes place as Lucy walks through the town square. Pigs and grey rats wander freely; the remaining townsfolk dance around the coffins; one group sits down for a nice meal in the wake of a plague. Lucy fights to escape those trying to dance with her, as the soundtrack plays a choral piece. The result is a purely visceral and delirious sequence that has never left my memory.Herzog has said he prefers the German version of Nosferatu over the English. I'm inclined to agree. As the years pass, and the viewings increase, any problems I initially had with the film only seemed to add to Nosferatu's greatness. Some say that in order for a film to be a true masterpiece, it has to be flawed. Herzog's films are filled with little flaws, many due to working with next to no funding. They're deeply personal, and were understandably emotional. And working with Kinski was always a volatile affair. But that's what does make them so endearing. There are many technically "perfect" films. Yet many of them that don't have that endearing quality. It's films like these that seem to stick with you, for better or for worse. For their flaws, or for what they achieve in spite of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Second only perhaps to Herr Schreck himself as Derr Count, creepy Klaus Kinski (under the artistic aegis of maestro Werner Herzog) delivers what has to be one of the most multi-faceted performances of his career: it's a gem, and Kinski's Orlock is at once pestilent and poignant, hovering somewhere in that ethereal limbo between the Human and the Inhuman. Despite his clearly unnatural ways, he still manages to convey a sense of timeless longing. The opening, haunting trek through the catacombs revealing the mummified remains of the ancient dead and the subsequent quiet but somehow still creepy trip through the haunted hills of Transylvania are mere preamble to the shocking introduction of The Count. (I saw this one when it premiered at an art house theater and there were only a handful of people on hand; I have to admit that I felt very much alone- like Harker in the movie- in that theater...) The silent but sinister arrival of the plague ship has to be one of the greatest sequences in all of fright film history. Herzog manages to document the dissolution of the town with a touch as deft as that of a plague rat. Isabelle Adjani never looked more beautiful, and her counterpoint to Kinski's Count is the dividing line between the living and the (un)dead. Good nacht...</fullReview>

Half the time is, what a pretentious hack God when will this s**t be over, the other half is my God that's beautiful, he really is a mad genius...and by the end I usually don't know what to think.I've never watched a movie by Herzog where the plot really amounted to much, the scenarios are set up, and they follow their natural courses, but it's the moments along the way, the journey itself, and not the prize at the end, that makes his film's worth watching.Herzog makes images, often of people being surrounded and enveloped by nature and the world around them, but images I can safely say I'd never seen before anywhere.Whether photographing a beach, a horde of plague rats, or a man wandering through mountains, there's a photorealism and dreaminess to everything that goes hand in hand, and that it's that kind of paradox that seems at the heart of Herzog, if it sounds like too much or not enough, just get out now.Nosferatu is the Dracula story most people are familiar with, no Romance here though, just craven greed and lust. But the directors skills transform it into something else...However I would be lying if I said I knew what, because it's not really the point, were given the images and the framework of the story and either we find something beautiful or true or we don't.I paused this movie quite a few times just to look at it, and that's the best endorsement I can give to this, and a lot of the Herzog stuff that I end up liking(Aguire:The Wrath Of God, Heart Of Glass, Even Dwarfs Started Small, Strosvek, etc). Beautiful, unique, and challenging, but not for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expressionistic remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everybody heard of the Transylvanian vampire Count Dracula, a character created by author - Bram Stoker, based upon the Gothic horror folktale of Vlad - the Impaler. There are many Dracula movies out there, most of them aren't even based on Stoker's work. Out of the films that have been based on the novel, only a few have truly captured the essence of the novel, and the best example is without a doubt Werner Herzog's "Nosferatu: Phantom der Natch". Though credited as a remake of F.W. Murnau's immortal classic of the silent cinema, this film is more of a homage to that than anything else. There aren't many lines in the movie (hint at silent cinema), and it doesn't need any really. The images speak for themselves. The characters' expressions, the dark, dreamlike settings and landscapes, the gorgeous soundtrack, the strong atmosphere of dread,nightmare sequences the otherworldy feel of the film, it is all so evocative, they talk on their own. The actors are brilliant, and Klaus Kinsi gives a different take on the character than Max Schrek's Count Orlock. Here, he is more of an anti-hero, a sad, depressed, tormented character who is unwillingly forced to stay in darkness and feed of others' lives, and not much of a completely evil. Isabelle Adjani is both gorgeous and a great actress, and shines in the role of Lucy. Overall, the film works on every level, it is scary, compelling and hauntingly beautiful. Indeed, one of the greatest horror movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dracula, or Nosferatu, has an heir and will never die</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of Murnau's Nosferatu. It speaks and it is full of colour. Very standard remake but a few changes are difficult to explain. For instance Mina and Lucy are inverted and Jonathan is married to Lucy. It may be Bremen but it looks like Amsterdam but with the sea next door. We have the same idea of a plague. But the director takes liberty with this plague and seems to organize at the end of it some kind of open air festivity and Last Supper for the survivors soon to be dead anyway. Morbid in other words. Herzog keeps the ending in which Lucy sacrifices herself by giving herself to Dracula to make him trespass the cock's crowing line. And she succeeds. A vampire in love is thus very silly and selfless enough to forget his survival instinct. But Herzog doubles up the ending with a good stake planted in Dracula's heart, but in the wings, and the arrest of Van Helsing for the murder of Dracula. He will be tried sooner or later. But the best change is that Lucy is dead and Jonathan has completed his transformation and has become a full-fledged vampire and we recapture the ending of the original where the danger of a next generation was left open. Here it is clearly stated and we see Jonathan crossing Europe again on horseback probably to go to his castle in Transylvania. The main interest of the film is not there. The main interest is in the phenomenal actors used for the main three characters and of course the absolutely astounding make-up of these actors. In other words, make-up added, this film recaptures the phenomenal body language and body expressivity of the old Murnau's film. It explains the fact that it does not seem to have very rich dialogues. It is all happening in the movement and syntax of the bodies on the screen.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine &amp; University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not exactly a bed-time story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the preconceived notion that most of the action would take place in Count Dracula's castle in a remote area beyond the Carpathian Mountains. An early sequence takes Jonathon there simply to get the Count's signature on papers relating to his purchase of real estate in Wisman. The Count, we soon find out, is a vampire quick to sample Jonathon's blood.Jonathon's wife Lucy (beautiful Isabelle Adjarni) always pale and wan has a telepathic fear that Jonathon is in danger. A bat gets entangled in her bedroom curtains. The atmosphere starts to get decidedly creepy. The Count cuts a lonely pathetic figure hungry for blood as he wanders about Wisman at night with a coffin under his arm. An alarming number of rats accompany him (where do the film makers find so many and whose job is it to control them on the set?) Deaths in the town are diagnosed as due to fevers by medicos, but Lucy insists they are the result of a vampire. Here we have the old argument of traditional medicine versus unproved myths.Kinski commands each scene. He has a characteristic method of acting. He says little, moves slowly and uses his eyes to great effect. He gasps and groans a lot. Except for that, you think you are watching a silent movie.Jonathon returns to Wisman a broken man, but his faithful wife Lucy who seems to be well-informed about the habits of vampires decides on a plan to rid the town of this vampire. For me this was the most compelling scene in the film. One night she attracts the vampire to her bed. He is sexually aroused, but soon darts at her throat making the most horrible sucking and slurping sounds as he drinks her blood. This is quite a gruesome scene. The vampire lingers too long and he is trapped by the light of day.I would like to mention Renfield (Roland Toper) who sends Jonathon to the castle. He's an odd man who ends every sentence with a giggle, half humorous, half threatening. A great little character with a brief appearance. At this early stage we already feel impending danger. And then there is the doctor unyielding at first, but later admitting that Lucy was right. He wields a mighty mallet ttoo on a stake that gets to the heart of the matter.If you like a blend of horror and drama, it is all here. Lots of atmosphere with creaking doors, bats, a multitude of rats, blood-sucking vampires, plague ,disease, mysterious deaths, coffins, cemeteries, the howling of wolves at night.....but do not despair. There is also true love which conquers all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favourite Vampire film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As is probably typical of one of my generation, I was at first taken aback by the seeming slowness of certain landscape shots. However, the accompaniment of Wagner (the title of that particular composition currently eludes me) merely added to a beauty which I usually overlooked in the scenery of films.Kinskis vampire is a criminally underrated horror icon. Forget the popular camped up image of an aristocratic and Napoleonic Dracula (and especially forget those idiotic punk rocker portrayals seen in Buffy and Blade) this is a vampire who views his own powers and immortality as a cross, yet knows the futility of going against his set destiny as a villain. It really disgusts me to see how such a complex and dark character gets overshadowed in popularity to slobbering masked killers like Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees.Definitely a film for people who wish to see vampires given back the dignity they're denied nowadays.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, this movie is visually one of the most gorgeous movies I have seen in a long time. The fact that it was made in 1979 does not date it all. The scenes are beautifully executed, and the color schemes are magnificent. To see the count's pale head against a pure backdrop of black was stunning.Early in the movie, however, I felt that some the landscape scenes went on a bit too long.If you have seen the 1922 original, you feel very familiar with this one. Many shots were set up almost exactly the same, but the technology to capture them was far greater in 1979.I loved this movie. I'm a horror buff, but not a vampire expert. Out of all the vampire movies I am familiar with, this would have to be my favorite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Dracula Movie Ever Made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best adaptation of Stoker's novel ever filmed. (I'm referring to the German version.) Herzog is one of the very, very few directors that has an identity. After Bergman, I think he is probably the greatest director alive today. This film combines a brilliant filmmaker (Herzog), a brilliant actor (Kinski), and a brilliant score (Popol Vuh). Very rare to get such a trifecta in one attempt. Those weaned on video games and MTV will undoubtedly dislike this movie, but a mature consideration along with an appreciation for a film's gestalt will lead one to recognize its merits. The sequence where the plague-ravaged townspeople dance in the square while an ethereal Georgian chant plays on the soundtrack is absolutely first-rate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Through a glass darkly, plus goofy script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Practically a scene-by-scene remake of Murnau's 1922 "Nosferatu," Herzog's 1979 version adds evocative though sometimes too heavy music (excerpts from Wagner's "Das Rheingold," and slightly fuzzy color photography. The fuzzy, somewhat washed-out color photography contributes to the film's vague dreamy quality, as does its unvarying, slow pacing. Kinski is wonderful as a man, or creature, condemned to eternal unlife, without love or friendship, whose dissatisfaction and doubts aren't strong enough to alter his basic, vampire nature.The dialogue, at least in the English version, damages the chill of the visuals. It is as bad, almost, as the dialogue in an Ed Wood movie. Or maybe a bit of Woody Allen thrown in (as in "What's Up, Tiger Lily"). A scene near the end is laughable. Van Helsing has just dispatched thevampire, Count Dracula, with a wooden stake. A town official (presumably, he is pompous and authoritarian) demands that Van Helsing be arrested for the murder of Count Dracula. A cringing figure, a mere town employee, quibbles that he can't do it, all the police are dead and who would watch Van Helsing in jail, anyway. Lucy Harker's utterings are embarrassingly corny. I applaud her for delivering her lines with a straight face! A 6 out of 10. With better dialogue, maybe and 8 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS ALL OVER ITA remake of the 1922 Murnau classic "Nosferatu" directed by German master Werner Herzog staring his fetish actor Klaus Kinski. Slow-paced and sinister, this movie however was disappointing for me. Having seen previous Herzog-Kinski colaborations I expected a surprising and personal film, instead of a Dracula adaptation that has its good and its bad points, but overall a classic horror film.Klaus Kinski's interpretation of Nosferatu is over the top and for me he's the best thing in the whole movie. The first scenes in the castle are really delightfull, especially when he has to prevent himself from drinking Jonathan Harker's blood. Isabelle Adjany's also very well. A few scenes are very good, like for example the one featuring the party of the townfolks that are doomed to die or a hilarious one when a man insists in sending Van Helsing to prison when the whole town has been devastated and there's no institution. This dialogue should be in the "memorable quotes" section.On the other side some parts are just too reiterative. As it's basically a straight-forward adaptation of the book with a few important but unexplainable changes (the characters of Mina and Lucy are interchanged and Van Helsing is transformed into a sceptical scientist) there're some scenes wich we have seen a million times in many vampire movies. This is my critic: Herzog doesn't provide as personal a view in the genre as he should have.The best vampire movie in my opinion is still "Dance of the vampires" and the best Dracula movie the Francis Ford Coppola one.SAY NO MORE</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My own copy of this film is likely the 'American' version, simply as it is titled 'Nosferatu the Vampyre. It is not subtitled, and if dubbed, was closely and expertly done. The magic of this film comes in it's reigning silence, it is rare for a film to get by with little or no score, and rarer still for it to succeed in doing so, which this depiction seems to do. This rendition of Stoker's famous work combines spot-on locations and costumes with gripping yet subtle performance by the players. Adjani is haunting with her extremely fair skin, and the character Renfield is almost humorously 'batty'. Klaus Kinski as Nosferatu is perfect with quiet, carefully (almost guarded at times) chosen speech, and seemingly mild demeanor for so heinous a fiend! Overall, this film very well captures the noir of haunting, 'old time' horror films, but with the cinematography and far-ranging freedoms of modern day filmmaking. A must-see for lovers of this genre, especially in the cult following of (Dracula) Nosferatu and his various 'adventures'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My least favourite Herzog film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I have only seen three films from Werner Herzog (as yet), he has already become one of my favourite European directors. His stories (and he certainly was a great storyteller) are deeply personal and deeply effecting, you can't help but be drawn into them through Herzog's hauntingly, hypnotic atmosphere. His odd stance and focus on the outsider in society, the position of the leader, and the relationship between man and nature would make you think that in his hands, Nosferatu would be one of the greatest films ever made... But it's not. And in my honest opinion is the worst of his films I've seen (once again, as yet). That's not to say it's a terrible film, it just doesn't hold a candle to Aguirre or Kasper Hauser, maybe because as an other reviewer pointed out, Herzog is the last director you would expect to be directing a horror film. One minor problem with Herzog is that his films have a tendency to be very slow, he's not afraid to let his camera linger on a Cliffside or a tree, this is something that although not too much of a problem with Aguirre (which was all about man versus nature), or Kasper Hauser (which was about a man seeing nature for the first time), but here it was just too much of a strain, accounting for why the film is just never really scary. All the Herzog trademarks are present and correct (Lush photography, the outsider, Klaus Kinski) but for me, Nosferatu never really worked. If the film has a saving grace it's in the performance of Kinski as Nosferatu, he really does give the character as tragic sense of introspective reflection, I can over look the fact that this is why the film is never scary (Dracula as Mr Burns as one review put it) because Kinski conveys more emotion as Nosferatu as he put in his other notable roles, and he clearly outshines the rest of the cast. And it is because of his beautiful performance that the film, in my opinion is elevated from 6/10 to a more honourable 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not one that generally gets caught up in a films imagery and metaphors, but I couldn't help it watching this one. It is a film that hinges on the imagery to keep it moving along. There is very little dialogue and it always has the feel of a silent movie. The actors gestures are in that tradition, with their movements very distinguished, but not over done. The images in the film are great. Arguably they are a little overdone sometimes as we are hit with a barrage of images of death or dying, and classic Dracula images. Images such as coffins, and tombstones, cemetaries, rats, bats and for that matter ill and dying people. The movie has a very thick feel of death or that death is near. The visuals provide and create a very foreboding atmosphere, and it makes the movie very tense. We never do get any crazy fights or chases, as it is all done and told in a very deliberate style, very disciplined, and in the style of a silent film more so. The actions and pictures we see speak louder than words, and a lot of dialogue would have hurt the film as a whole. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it over all. It loses a bit of steam in the second half of the movie, but not that much. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Greatest Vampire Movies Ever!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is very hard to imagine a remake actually improving upon the original film, impossible even. But Werner Herzog's remake of the silent classic "Nosferatu" is the exception to this rule. The film is everything you could dream of. Scary, surreal, touching, atmospheric and breathtaking with all these elements in almost perfect harmony. Lawyer Jonathan Harker travels to the castle of Count Dracula in the Carpathian Mountains, despite the warnings of his beloved wife Mina. Despite the warnings of the locals living in the shadow of the castle, he continues on his journey. When he arrives at the castle he disturbed and terrorised by the grotesque, rat-like Count Dracula. Having driven Harker insane the Count falls in love with his wife Mina and travels across the sea to claim her bringing hordes of rats, plague and pestilence with him. Distraught at the condition of her beloved husband, Mina deceides to put pay to the Counts evil once and for all.This film drastically re-invents the whole Dracula story, which has been choked by countless campy Hammer Horror films restoring fear and loathing to the character. This is boosted by the amazing performance of Klaus Kinski as the count infusing the character with a great sense of pity as well as revulsion. Kinski will always be to my mind the greatest of all screen Dracula's and this will always be to my mind one of the most accomplished vampire films ever. If there is one fault of the film it is that Herzog tends to make the film a bit too visual for its own good, undermining the brilliance of the performances.Overall though this is a terrific film.My Rating: 8 Out Of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mesmerizing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a fine line (a VERY fine line) between the hypnotic and the sleep-inducing and, for my taste, Herzog crosses back and forth it throughout this film. I'd be hard pressed to say that I actually *disliked* Nosferatu: it is littered with haunting images of unforgettable power and beauty (strange beauty, eerie beauty), and its use of music is truly inspired. However, much like Kubrick in his later years, Herzog is a director who focuses so much painstaking detail on individual shot compositions that he loses sight of how to move a story along or keep it fluid and interesting. The characters, too, never take on any real life or identity - all seem to be sleep-walking through the picture in frozen poses. This is not entirely inappropriate, of course, to a film about the living dead, and adds immeasurably to the film's haunting quality. But it leaves the movie without any real center of focus or identity.The film is ultimately an enigma. It doesn't really engage the mind or the heart (and is certainly not "scary") but on a purely sensual level it does get under your skin. See it for its remarkable images and ability to invoke creepiness and dread, but expect little else. Also, I found it to be more powerful taken in small doses, a little at a time - that way, you are free to wonder afresh at each new directorial flourish, without noticing so much the snail's pace or the indifferent storytelling (I must admit to dozing off on more than one occasion when I attempted to watch it straight through). The ending was particularly disappointing; primed for a battle of wits between the heroine and the vampire, all that one gets is a prolonged suck-and-claw sequence which holds little power or surprise.Having never seen the 1921 Murnau original, I can make no claim either way as to the film's faithfulness, but it certainly adds nothing significant to vampire lore. In other words, there's no new twists or wrinkles here for anyone already familiar with the Dracula story. I would, however, add this to that rare list of films whose visual power is so great that it may be worth putting aside one's reservations about the appeal of its story (other films in this category for me include Blade Runner, Brazil, Apocalypse Now and, to a lesser extent, Tim Burton's original Batman). You'll have to judge for yourself whether you're the type of person who is willing and able to make that trade-off.ONE FINAL NOTE: I saw this movie in its dubbed English version (it is also available in German with English subtitles) and I would highly recommend it. Watching foreign movies in their native tongue has its own merits, of course, and I wouldn't discourage it. But this was perhaps the best dubbing job I have ever seen, and the film loses nothing by seeing it in this way.</fullReview>

Isabelle Adjani is one tough little number as Lucy, sacrificing herself to stop him in a climax that is, like the rest of the movie, more beautiful than frightening. Herzog chooses to reinstate Stoker's character names, as opposed to the 1921 original, which was a thinly veiled knock-off of the master's novel.Fun Fact: Kate Bush used portions of the movie's soundtrack, with Herzog's permission, in her 1985 album, "Hounds of Love."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprisingly blown away by this rather artistic and deeply obscure outtake on Bram Stoker's masterpiece. Being new to Herzog's films, i wasn't sure as of what to expect. I have watched some other Dracula/Nosferatu adaptations, but none of them can top this one. the best word one could use to describe it is "beautiful". from the impeccable art direction and photography, the way it was shot, the make-up department (and any other technical aspects, you name it), to the haunting quality of the sceneries and that soundtrack! Herzog couldn't have picked a better band than Popol Vuh to create such an atmosphere of restlessness and growing tension.Adding to that, what a great performance by Klaus Kinski, i was literally terrified on those scenes inside the Count's castle, which is hard to say for any so proclaimed horror movie these days. I liked the more melancholic approach to Nosferatu on this one, as opposed to the almost megalomaniac portrayal of other versions.And, if you're not satisfied, there's even some humor poured on top of it! The scene by the end, where the town officers engage on a discussion of whether or not it would make sense to arrest Van Helsing, seen that almost the whole of the population of the town is dead, so there wouldn't be anyone to guard the cell, it's simply hilarious in an obscure and unexpected way.Finally, i think this was a truly great film and it's still relevant to this day, perhaps the most relevant when the topic is Bram Stoker's creation. Besides, it was my initiation on Werner Herzog's films, which was very instigating and it certainly has me looking forward to watching other works of his.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A grand homage to the original silent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's widely accepted that F.W. Murnau's 1922 silent film "Nosferatu" is one of the greatest horror films of all time. The epic scene of actor Max Schreck rising from his coffin is easily one of the most frightening moments captured on celluloid. Francis Ford Coppola even mimicked it for his big-budget 1992 adaptation, "Bram Stoker's Dracula." The very look of Count Orlock has been imitated in cult favorite vampire films like "Subspecies" and the 1979 TV mini-series "Salem's Lot.""Nosferatu the Vampyre" is a perfect example of cinematic genius and a remake that reverently improves on the original in some aspects. Every scene found in the film drips with chilling atmosphere and historic accuracy. For 107 minutes, Director/Writer Herzog transports us to the year 1850 and takes us on a journey from Wismar, Germany into the Carpathian Mountains and then back to Wismar, where a horrific plague is the perfect cover for Count Dracula's (Klaus Kinski) insatiable hunger."Nosferatu the Vampyre" is rated PG for violence, sensuality, and frightening/intense scenes. There's not as much blood and graphic brutality as you would expect from a horror movie made in the late 1970s. Herzog relied on the mood he set for each sequence, leaving the gore and violence off-screen and to your imagination. There's no nudity or sex scenes, although Dracula does some suggestive touching as he feeds on his prey. We're also privy to some heavy breathing by both the vampire and his victim.It's extremely evident "Nosferatu the Vampyre" is Werner Herzog's grand homage to the original silent film. It was the Director's way of bringing the masterpiece to the big-screen in a way F.W. Murnau could've only imagined when he made the original: in color, featuring audio, and using the actual names of the characters found in Bram Stoker's "Dracula" novel. Murnau was never allowed to do this because Stoker's widow wouldn't give him permission. It's Herzog's ultimate tribute to what he considers "the greatest film ever to come out of Germany."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Unique "Dracula" Adaptation?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film in the late nineties, back when AMC's MonsterFest was still awesome. I was around twelve and hadn't seen the original. I remember finding this slow and off-putting. Looking back, all I remembered were a few scenes: Lucy looking into a mirror, her door opening, the vampire appearing next to her. A dinner table in a town's square covered with rats. A man riding a horse across a swirling, wind-blown desert. It was definitely time to revisit.Herzog's "Nosferatu" doesn't have much in common with the original. He, rightfully, doesn't try to recreate too many of Mureau's iconic images. Max Shriek's Graf Orlok was a monstrous, soulless demon. Klaus Kinski's Dracula is, while deeply inhuman, quietly envious of humanity. This film focuses more on the plague ravaging the German small town. It also adds a new downbeat ending. Very much a seventy's era Herzog film.It's also extremely creepy. The film starts with real-life mummies in Guanajuato, Mexico, setting up the unsettling tone. The town falling apart from the plague, dead animals in the streets, people dancing or rows of coffins being walked around, are surreal images. Klaus Kinski seems totally alien. In the spookiest moment, we see Dracula walking down a black-blue hallway, his white face slowly appearing. After entering Harker's bedroom, he hovers over his bed. The scene recalls classical night terror imagery. Kinski is twitchy, especially when sucking a drop of blood from Harker's finger, but mostly contains his fiery insanity, playing the vampire as distinctly separated from humanity. Scenes of him looking through a window at Lucy visually illustrates this disconnect from people yet his deep longing to belong. It's a testament to Herzog's sense of otherworldliness that Dracula is sympathetic but still scary. Kinski also has one of the strangest death scenes on film. It certainly outdoes Orlok fading away in the original.While the outline of the novel is maintained, the film deviates wildly. Lucy, now Harker's wife, is the hero. Adjani plays her as very strong, attuned to strangeness through her dreams. Though wide-eyed and virginal, she uses her sexuality to save the day. Van Helsing is no longer a heroic vampire slayer, instead a skeptical, impotent man of science. Renfield is played by a cackling, seriously insane seeming Roland Topor. He spends most of the movie locked up in a sanitarium and, when he finally meets Dracula, the vampire dismisses him, sends him on a pointless journey to his death. Mina appears in three scenes. Harker spends most of the movie confined to a chair.The Herzogian aesthetic is obvious. There are long scenes of characters walking around caves and waterfalls, accompanied by droning music. The gypsies are given an extended role, played by actual local Roma. There's many surreal touches, like a little boy playing an out-of-tune violin. The dream-like, slow pacing makes the film tricky to get into.The original "Nosferatu" created startling horror imagery that resonates to this day. Herzog's "Nosferatu" is a deeply creepy, surreal, personal reinvention of the material. It's a horror movie not quite like any other and perhaps the most unique "Dracula" adaptation ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thing of beauty is a joy forever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Werner Herzog's remake of the silent vampire classic is a thing of beauty: an intensely visual viewing experience in which every shot is as carefully composed as a landscape artist's painting. Indeed, NOSFERATU THE VAMPYRE is a feast for the eyes, packed full of beautiful Gothic imagery from beginning to end. While it lacks the power of the director's earlier AGUIRRE, WRATH OF GOD, this is nevertheless a compelling film of the type to be savoured It's a superbly judged movie in which every scene has been carefully created to contribute to the eerie atmosphere. It opens with a chilling pan over a number of real-life mummified bodies (actually filmed in Mexico) and from there throws us into a dark and compelling world. Kinski, so frequently Herzog's muse, is as good as Nosferatu as you'd expect, a mixture of the repellent, the pitiful and the disturbing. Isabelle Adjani makes for a suitably ethereal heroine, matching the best of the Hammer scream queens. Bruno Ganz, later to come to some acclaim for his performance as Hitler in DOWNFALL, gives one of the most interesting interpretations of Jonathan Harker that I've seen in an adaptation of the Stoker novel.In the end, though, it's Herzog himself who holds the attention here with a film that could be split into individual frames and sold for its artistic beauty. The highlight is undoubtedly the rat invasion halfway through, in which the streets are seething with vermin and townsfolk hold an impromptu "last supper" to celebrate. As much a Gothic masterpiece as you'd hope for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective and intriguing periodic drama about the unleashing of Hell and how certain people of a nineteenth-century German town react to it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Herzog begins his film, Nosferatu: Phantom of the Night ,with two title sequences, arguably the two most juxtaposed title sequences of all the films that have decided to go down a route of deciding that two are better than just one. The first is an eerie passage of play consisting of strange mummified figures sporting pained faces and accompanied by odd orchestral music; a series of tracking shots followed by a bat swooping down from the top of the frame in dogged slow motion and set up, it seems, so as to resemble a bird of prey swooping down on its mark. The victimised expressions on the mummified, cave based remains followed by a semiotical sense of something of great power coming down on top of something it has the ability to snare is effectively put across in the opening, something that is jarring but exists for more than just petty cinematic frills so as to grab a viewer's attention. That being because the sequence echoes what the film will go on to revolve around, that being a small and scraggly little man with a goal that resembles the coming down on top of an item he hopes to victimise and cause enough terror so that those on the wrong end of his wrath will see fit to bear similar expressions to that of the remains at the beginning. The second sequence sees Herzog distract us from this foreshadowing with a cutting away of this terrifying sequence in an extremed manner; seeing fit to secondly provide an angelic and uplifting montage of puppies and all things much nicer to more choral music.The eventual catalyst for Klaus Kinski's Count Dracula, and his moving away from the safe but un-Earthly confines of his large and secluded castle in Werner Herzog's re-imagining of the classic 1920s film, began with the visit of what was essentially an estate agent there to meet with the Count about the proposed purchasing of new properties. But it is a different reason altogether, albeit because of said estate agent that sees him veer off, and that is his observing and consequent lust to seek out a certain Lucy Harker (Adjani), the wife of the estate agent, of whom he notices by way of a photograph which eventually pushes him over the precipice of wanting to venture out into the dangerous unknown. The wider world is a hazard to him only because he is a demon of the night, a vampire whom is aware it is impossible to expose oneself to daylight through risk of death. Despite this weakness, and the distinct vulnerability you'd think the Count faces because of it, the film manages to maintain a surprising amount of threat born out of his mere presence, anyway.The aforementioned estate agent is a certain Jonathan Harker (Ganz), a man charged with venturing long and high over the hills so as to meet with Dracula. Herzog constructs his journey and findings as if a short film within the overall spectrum of the feature, the discovering of a rest stop in the form of a tavern seeing him and his horse greeted by an array of locals whom react to him in a manner that suggests they do not especially receive the company of many people from out of town. We feel, through how the locals react and in a more visual sense in Harker's attire when compared to that of the locals, that he is both a little out of his depth and beyond some kind of respective void. As the trip to Dracula's castle nears and this sense of alienation in his surroundings becomes more prominent, the film effectively instills degrees of fear and doubt as to whether what he's doing is a good idea.As Jon arrives at his destination, we're greeted by a chorus of triumphant and welcoming bursts of music while the man himself is greeted by an elderly, frail and bedraggled little person whom we're immediately at unease with. His hospitality is kind and gentle, his later goals anything but and after a plethora of long shots encompassing magnificent hills, skies and vast rural locales as Harker travelled to this place, we are now effectively confined to small and enclosed spaces in the corners of this deathly quiet stone palace as evening meals play out in awkward, border line twisted, silence. As a sordid relationship consisting of a host and their guest plays out to a climax, a climax of which the new order sees Dracula attempt to journey all the way back so as to track down Lucy, the shift in focus so as to zero in on those in the town of Wismar where Lucy is based and Jonathan's race against time so as to warn them takes over. Here, Lucy adopts more of a prominent role in the film; Herzog transforming her from the casual housewife patiently waiting back home for her husband to return once he's finished business, and into a more involved character whose actions see her placed on the front-line at the coming of Dracula. Where years of popular culture and prior knowledge of other texts dealing with either this story or genre specificities, Herzog has crafted a stand alone film which is dramatic; ominous and tension filled. This is an effective, and mostly affecting, piece which shifts gears and changes direction so as to forge an engaging narrative with decent attention to its characters somewhat beautifully, and is recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't your daddy's vampire movie. Unless you have seen the 1922 version of Nosferatu, you have never seen anything that resembles this film. It is not a remake, but an homage and update to a terrific story.The film is terrifying, but not in a bloodsucking way. It is a highly stylized film with magnificent cinematography. It is a slow, thoughtful, and provocative film that examines the depths of Count Dracula's pain.Dracula is played magnificently by Klaus Kinski, who appears in many Werner Herzog films, including Aguirre: The Wrath of God, and Fitzcarraldo.Bruno Ganz (Downfall) and Isabelle Adjani (Camille Claudel) are equally great.It is not so much a film to be eaten quickly, but one to be savored like a fine meal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great Herzog film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1920, German director F. W. Murneau made an extraordinary movie, which turned into a revolution of unparalleled proportions. Nosferatu became the first official horror movie. Despite fairly successful restoration attempts of the picture, it still remains fairly grainy and choppy. If that bothers you than Werner Herzog's remake is perfect. He successfully recaptures a number of the distinctive qualities of the original, and also with sixty years advancement in color, light and sound, there is so much more that one can do with a movie. One way you can tell if a film is creative is when you cannot think of a single word to describe it. Such is the case with this one. There are times when Nosferatu is aesthetic and almost operatic and then there are times when it is extremely bleak and murky, but it all fits together well.In addition to having a great mind, Herzog also has a great eye. This is evident from the way he photographs the movie. If you were to pick any five shots from the movie, you might find they would all make great paintings.For those of you who don't know, Nosferatu is the same story as Dracula only with a couple of the names changed. The plot however isn't very important. Nosferatu is all about tone, and the elements of design, both the original and the remake are worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, you have the story of Nosferatu, Klaus Kinski and Werner Herzog. For any movie fanatic, this movie is essential viewing. And low and behold this movie delivers.Count Dracula has sent a letter to our male lead's employer. Harker being the gentlemen courtier that he is, knows that this would greatly benefit Lucy, the love of his life. He takes voyage to Transylvania to meet Count Dracula and assist him on his way back to Wisman. Harker knows about his wife's predictions and the words of the local gypsies and caretakers. But still, he perseveres and makes his way to the Count's Castle. Once he meets and enters Dracula's castle you know immediately that he's gotten himself into deep trouble. And you know the trouble will not be ending here in the castle.Enter Kinski. This is my first movie with Kinski, and you betcha it won't be my last. The guy is a fantastic actor that truly does zone in on things only the best do. Facial expressions, eye movement, tone of voice, realistic mannerisms, precise timing. You get all of this rolled into one creepy role as he portrays Count Dracula. Mix his acting with unbelievable lighting and cinematography and you achieve one of the very best portrayals of the prince of darkness. A truly unforgettable role.The movie itself as a whole is no slouch either. It is a slow-burn film so anyone who has slim patience for such movies may be bored by some scenes. But if you're a fan of Herzog and his fantastic story-telling, then you will be right at home. All actors do their jobs quite well, as the men who play Harker and Renfield are very good. And obviously you have the legend Kinski demanding every single scene. I believe it to be one of the best Vampire movies ever made, and easily one of the best re-makes ever made. I'd always exclaim Carpenter's The Thing as the best, but now, I'm not so sure. If you enjoy well- made films with all facets of great movie-making, then watch this flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It really depends on your tastes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the 1922 film, "Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens", I soon tried to watch this more recent adaptation of Bram Stoker's "Dracula". When I first tried to watch "Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht" (a.k.a. "Nosferatu the Vampyre"), it looked promising to me around the beginning, and I managed to watch the majority of the film, but then found that I couldn't take it any more and gave up. Fortunately, I made another attempt to watch it, and while I can't say I think nearly as much of it as many others do, I was still moderately impressed with certain aspects of it.Jonathan Harker lives with his wife, Lucy in Wismar, Germany, and works as a real estate agent. One day, when Jonathan arrives at work, he is told by his strange boss, Renfield, that Count Dracula wants to buy a house in Wismar, so he is sent on a long journey to the count's castle in Transylvania to complete the sale. On Harker's journey, he arrives at an inn, where he is warned about his destination, but he believes that it is only superstition. He finally arrives late at night at Count Dracula's castle after travelling for four weeks, but eventually, he learns that the count really is a vampire! As Harker sees Dracula leave for Wismar, he fears for Lucy! Meanwhile, the people of Wismar have no clue that it won't be long before the plague is brought to their town! Several well-known movie adaptations of "Dracula" have been made, and Werner Herzog's "Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht" is considered a remake of F.W. Murnau's "Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens", the earliest "Dracula" adaptation of the bunch. Therefore, I feel I should point out that this 1979 version is different from the 1922 film in more ways than the obvious fact that it has colour and sound. The most significant difference is that "Phantom der Nacht" is VERY slow-paced (which is the main thing that bothered me when I first tried to watch it). I will also mention that the vampire is a bit different here. Klaus Kinski plays a vampire who is more sorrowful than the one played by Max Schreck.This Werner Herzog film has received a lot of praise, as well as its fair share of criticism. The slowness of the film can ruin it for some viewers, while others can get over it and be intrigued by other qualities of this film, such as the atmosphere and scenic views. Some find this film scary, while others think it's a joke. Personally, I didn't find this film that great, mainly due to its slowness, but found that other qualities of the film (the scenery, Kinski's performance, some mildly chilling moments, etc.) made it watchable. Of course, many others could see a lot more in "Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht" than I do, so it really depends. If horror movies have to be fast-paced and intense in order to keep you satisfied, this one is not for you, but if you can get over the extreme slowness, and the other aspects of the film I've mentioned sound interesting, you could find a lot in this adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a story of melancholy and death and a strange masterpiece that is perhaps the only remake of a classic movie that reaches to be far better than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Werner Herzog's "Nosferatu" is not another horror movie nor you will find in it the same charming and sexy Dracula the plain vampire movies explored infinitely. Without losing the erotic appeal, it's a story of melancholy and death that surpasses logic and reason, showing the desire of living (which may also be desire of dying, why not?) put above all civilization's rules. In the opening, when we see those mummies, we are being introduced to a very eloquent vision of a humankind and a civilization that have death in their essence and can't avoid it anyway. The journey of the Jonathan Harkers, Lucy's husband, to Transilvania, is something like a progressive entering in darkness and hell mixed with beauty, and this beauty makes the movie something unusual, for it's quite clear that is more important than any fright other directors would use. I'ts a strange masterpiece, and perhaps the only remake of a classic that can be considered far better than the original.The music, by Popol Vuh, Wagner and Gounod, and the beauty of the images, make us sink into chilling reverence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dracula as a lonely old man.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Werner Herzog is not the kind of director you would expect to make a horror film, which probably accounts for the slow, hypnotic (but never scary) atmosphere of the film. Herzog, although a genius, always strikes me as someone who enjoyed filming nature more than actors, and this could never be clearer than in the scenes where Jonathan Harker (Bruno Ganz) makes his way to Nosferatu's castle. Beautiful yes but does it have meaning, this film isn't saying anything-about man and nature, like say Aguirre or Fitzcaraldo... This is a story about people. So lets move on to the people, firstly I would like to say just how awful Isabelle Adjani's performance is, it really sinks the film. I can't help feeling that Herzog cast her only for her beauty. Bruno Ganz does very little, which isn't really fair, he does do quite well towards the beginning of the film, especially the scenes that take place in the Castle, but the film moves on and he is forgotten. But now we come to Kinski's Nosferatu, now I cannot agree with people who say that this performance isn't something special, and it's with this performance that the film really takes off.We get the sense for the first time that being a vampire isn't all drinking blood and seducing women, Kinski's vampire is in real pain. Herzog and Kinski have envisioned their Dracula as a lonely old man, frail and weak, a man angry at the predicament his condition has left him in, sure he's more Mr Burns from The Simpsons than actually terrifying, but like I said, Herzog could not make a horror film, he is a thoughtful and poetic film maker.I would rate Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht (The Vampire) as 7/10, the film is just spoiled by Adjani's performance, and a slight feeling of boredom whenever Kinski isn't on screen. But for lovers of beautiful visuals and haunting mood, Nosferatu can't fail.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a movie but a movement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This must be a terrible movie from the horror buff's point of view. It's slow-moving and there's (almost) no blood and gore, no action...In my opinion it's nothing less than a movie about European and most of all German culture. It reflects Romanticism, Naturalism and the whole Berlin movement of the late '70s/ early '80s - remember David Bowie's "Heroes". In at least certain parts of Europe it gained cult reputation as THE classic of the Punk/New Wave movement. Indeed: Isabelle Adjani with her pale expressionist beauty, Bruno Ganz and his sleepwalking, depressingly tragic figure, and Klaus Kinski's lonely Nosferatu must have been perfect Generation X icons. The whole movie stinks of rotten death and downfall, of "No future"! I remember this movie in the first place because of it's very impressive and haunting visual moments: Ganz's Transsylvania hike (underscored by a great soundtrack), Adjani sitting on a bank near the sea, the depiction of the plague and people's reaction to it - striking moments which elevate this movie to a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're into vampires, this plays havoc with the legend, but if you're into visuals, it's perfectly wonderful. The plague scenes in the courtyard/city square with pigs and banquets and folks going happily mad on their way to the Reaper are worth the price of admission all by themselves. And the rats - I kept wondering how they got them back in their cages after each take.Poor Bruno Ganz, who doesn't get the girl; poor Doctor Von Helsing, who walks around like a zombie, but never gets bitten; poor Lucy, whose noble act is thwarted.Klaus Kinski's face is a visual match for the silent Nosferatu, but bodily is mistakenly cast; indeed, he seems too frail to be toting those coffins in and out of hiding places. I hate to nitpick; you either buy it all or none of it, but I've got to ask: why does he cringe (after depositing the first coffin) at the sight of a mere cross (not even a crucifix), when the building he enters is bedecked with them? Oh well...Makes no difference. If you're looking for realism, well, you wouldn't be watching this. Isabelle Adjani is beautiful, as usual; Bruno Ganz is just window dressing, Klaus Kinski is angst-ridden: he wants to be loved, he wants to grow old.I bought the video under false pretenses - this is no masterpiece, but it is surely worth renting. Give me the Frank Langella Drac any day!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bit of a disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say, I'm rather disappointed by this film. I loved both Murnau's Nosferatu and Herzog's Aguirre, and I had high hopes for this. The cinematography was worthy certainly; it's a beautifully shot and designed film. However, the remake lacked any sort of punch. It just seemed sort of listless. I'm not sure the Nosferatu character was well served by having lines. Too humanizing.One of the best things about the Schreck Nosferatu is that it seemed more closely related to a rat than a human being. The snaggle-teeth, wide-eyes, stiff walk, and outstretched fingers were memorable. Kinski, whom I normally like, just didn't seem to have a lot to do. All his creepy scenes on the ship, in his castle, and stalking through the town late at night were reduced. Instead he was given scenes like the one in which he talks with the insane Renfield which seriously detracts from the character.Much of the movie seem to suffer from Insufferable European Pointless Pretentiousness Syndrome, whereby blank stares and inscrutable suffering are elevated to high art. Renfield was just plain annoying. The only improvement over the original was Bruno Ganz as Harker, the first guy to play that role who didn't need a smack in the head. His final scene is great also.I don't know what Herzog must have been thinking through most of this film. It may purport to be a thinking man's Dracula, but it doesn't seem to be saying much, even below the surface. It is a very pretty and competently done film though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Version of the Familiar Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nosferatu (1979) **** (out of 4)Herzog's near flawless remake of the 1922 German classic gives us Klaus Kinski playing Count Dracula but unlike any film version before or since. We all know the story as Dracula lures Harker (Bruno Ganz) to his castle and soon sets his eyes on his fianc Lucy (Isabelle Adjani). By 1979 the tale of Dracula had been told at least a few hundred times too many and considering the type of movies Herzog was making, one would wonder why he's want to deliver us another version of the familiar story but it's a good thing he did because this here is without question one of the most beautiful, haunting and downright unique horror films ever made. I believe this latest viewing was my third and it's rather remarkable at how wonderful and creepy this film is and how even though we know every inch of the story it's still like we're seeing it for the first time. The film is very slow, there's no question about it but the slowness here isn't a negative thing but it's just one part of the terrific atmosphere built up by Herzog. This is such a strange film to experience because the slowness is also surrounding by a certain cold nature and a cold look that makes the film come to life. The life of the film is centered around the fact that everything looks and feels dead. I think the pure genius of Herzog is painting a world where we really get to feel what it's like to be Dracula. The world is a cold one, an ugly one and a rather lonely one. I think the film's greatest aspect is that Herzog builds up this atmosphere so perfect that even though we've seen this story told hundreds of times, this here seems the most fresh and original. Two other important factors in this is the cinematography by Jorg Schmidt-Reitwein and the haunting music score by Popol Vuh. Both of these aspects add in heavily on the atmosphere and the damp look of the film is something that will make you want to pause the movie and just soak it in. Another important factor in all of this are the performances, which are all quite strange yet so realistic that you can't help but feel as if you're witnessing these characters for the first time. Ganz makes for a perfect Harker and Adjani has the perfect feel and tone for Lucy. Both Roland Toper as Renfield and Walter Ladengast as Van Helsing are perfect but so are various actors in smaller parts. Then, of course, there's Kinski who is simply chilling in the role. He has very little to say but Kinski is brilliant at getting Dracula's emotions to come through without words. Just take a look at Kinski working in the scene where Harker is eating and take a look at Kinski's eyes as he simply stands there watching him eat. Another great example is when Dracula first encounters Lucy. The way Kinski plays all of this is pitch-perfect. From the haunting opening shots of the mummies up until the chilling end, Herzog paints a true and ugly portrait that is remarkable and something so original that it's hard to believe the effort was made to begin with and it's even more remarkable that it came off so well. There are so many haunting shots here with one of my favorites not being linked to any horror sequence. It happens on Harker's walk to Dracula's castle when he's walking along the river and about to go into the cave. The view of this as well as the waterfall are just chilling. People often asks how many times much a familiar story or familiar subject matter be remade and it's quite clear that if you have the talent then you can do something truly original no matter how many times it was tried before your work. This is a very unique film and certainly one of the greatest of its kind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Artistically, NOSFERATU is flawless. It would be next to impossible to recreate Stoker's novel and not compare this movie. The scenery is breathtaking, the costumes are top-notch. The dark and gothic mood perfectly suits and the music is satisfactory. Sound plays a key role in this movie, as it always should.Jonathan Harker is sent (by Renfield!) to finish up business with a count in buying a house. Harker, and the whole town for that matter, are getting more than they bargained for.The changes to Stoker's novel does not affect the movie whatsoever. You're intrigued from the get-go and the first half of NOSFERATU sucks you right in. The only quips are the title character and the oversaturation of art. Dracula this time around is an emotional, brooding wuss and his character study was wrongly placed in the movie, hindering the effect rather than drawing you in. Klaus' acting has no terror though everyone sells it to the best of their ability. The art also has for more legs than the story (particularly the second half), disrupting the flow of a good movie, though this can be argued. Two thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This version of Nosferatu is not a faithful remake of the older versions, nor is it a dismal remake, as so many here seem to think. First, it seems that many have seen the pretty bad English language version. Second, almost everyone here doesn't realize that this version is a parody of the Dracula story. Thus the over the top performance of Kinski, the overly wilted lily Adjani, etc, etc. Take the scene were Kinski is admiring Adjani through the window when all of a sudden his mole Topor shows up to worship him. Also, the scene of Kinski removing his coffins from the ill-fated boat. And the scene where the Dr has pounded a stake through Dracula's heart, only to be threatened with arrest, yet all the police are dead. Even the Popul Vuh music is a parody of horror movie music. Put altogether, the film is great. Yes, it is slow moving, so what? If you are looking for a scary version of the story, probably the PBS Louis Jordan version is the best. But if you are looking for a very irreverent interpretation, this is it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid vampire film but regrettably dwarfed by the original 'Nosferatu' and even 'Dracula' and 'Vampyr'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one subjective review:Being a fan of both Murnau's 'Nosferatu' and Werner Herzorg, I, nevertheless, had mixed feelings before watching 'Nosferatu the Vampyre'. I rate Herzog as a brilliant filmmaker and a striking character, but was he up to the task of remaking the one and only Nosferatu!? Remakes come rarely to satisfy and expand the horizon of an audience who has experienced the original film. And unfortunately, this one falls as no exception.'Nosferatu the Vampyre' offers beautiful scenes, gripping atmospheres and a stunning performance by Kinski. However the film is doomed from the start for it will be compared to Muranu's original (and Browning's and Dreyer's and Hammer's, and now Cappola's too) on every aspect.'Nosferatu the Vampyre', ultimately, can not match the exquisite imagery of Murnau's 'Nosferatu'. The beautiful images of Herzog are impressive and eerie, but they are dwarfed when compared to the iconographic images of the original. However the more troubling thing is that, the spaces and sets (which is the primary element of Nosferatu) are just much smaller! I mean this is a Gothic film. Scale matters immensely. This aspect of being small, alone, shatters the hopes of an audience eager to re-visit a glimpse of the glory of the original film.Is Herzog's film is a realist take (with surreal episodes)? I think not. Shaky camera movements don't make a film realistic. And if it doesn't make it realistic, it inevitably makes it small. However it is the style of acting which is decisive upon this matter. One can not keep his sanity if he was to be greeted by a hideous face like the Count's (especially Lovecraft would not approve this at all). So, Herzog's film is as theatrical as the original 'Nosferatu', Browning's 'Dracula' and Cappola's 'Dracula'. Yet it lacks the scale, it lacks the glory, it lacks the show!Browning's 'Dracula' is a theatrical, more tame but very glorious classic. Carl Dreyer's 'Vampyr' had brand new fantastic elements and amazing imagery (equal to Muranu's) - maybe the most ghastly vampire film of all times. It even qualifies as surreal and realistic.Considering the colossal, flamboyant and malicious nature of Cappola's 'Dracula' (with the exception of Reeves' annoying presence, despite the good performance), one can say Cappola brought something new to the table (personally I wouldn't rate it as good as Muranu's 'Nosferatu', It is an interesting and beautiful remake, regardless of being better or not).Herzog's 'Nosferatu the Vampyr' falls short compared to these films in every possible term; imagery, acting, scale, ghastliness and glory. The only thing it brings to the table is a very good Nosferatu character (and make-up). In this sense the film is parallel to the Hammer's 'Dracula'. Both are great films. Both have unforgettable Counts. But both are overshadowed by films which are the titans of horror literature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has a lot of rough edges and no decent climax. Kinski as Dracula works well, as does Isabel Adjani as Lucy. But the blocking of the camera is amateurish, the perspective is confused, and worst of all, it's the only vampire movie that doesn't scare anyone. (Oh by the way, if you are on the way to driving a stake into a vampire's heart, don't appear in the next scene with the stake in your hand; you are supposed to leave it in.)Herzog has said that this movie was an attempt to show the highest values of his own culture. I have no idea whether he succeeded, but as a movie, this is a failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I realize that I don't have many remakes as some of my favorite movies. I feel kind of bad for not remembering the original 1922 movie that well, because it is one of my favorite silent movies. It's just great to see a new version of this story without any need to update it. Well, it wouldn't work out any way because they simply didn't change the time that it took place. It's great to see everything being kept from the original movie and seeing it in color. It's still not quite as good as the original, probably because the original just broke so much new ground for cinema in general.This is quite faithful to the original movie as best as I can remember. The atmosphere is just beautiful here. The weird thing is that in the original half hour, it comes off as kind of clichd. It's not until Nosferatu appears that the film really gets its own style. I realize that even back then, the film was great because it really did show off a unique style and a great setting even if the story itself wasn't that original. Now, he was referred to as Dracula in this version and not Nosferatu or Count Orlock. It doesn't matter because it's a great movie whatever his name is. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Nosferatu the Vampyre" (also known as "Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht" auf Deutsch), is a remake of the F.W. Murnau film, which follows Count Dracula and his "interest" in buying a castle near the Black Sea; Jonathan Harker, along with his wife, Lucy, become entangled with the Count, who has had a profound effect on Jonathan.Often lauded as one of the better vampire films, Werner Herzog's retelling of the 1922 film is indisputably beautiful. The film opens with a chilling montage of various corpses in a catacomb, followed by a lingering shot of a bat against a dark turquoise sky, all set to a chilling and ethereal score. This is the kind of fashion in which the entire film is presented; long, moody shots of characters, and quiet emphasis on foggy fields and dark mountain passes. It is these precise moments that make Herzog's film stand out, and are also what make it so eerie. The score is haunting and accentuates the loneliness and solitude of these scenes, and the turnout is equally gorgeous and harrowing. As a mood piece, the film is phenomenal.Some have complained about the film's slow nature, and I'll give them that?this is not a narrative-driven film, and it is slow as molasses at times. The viewer needs to understand what they are getting themselves into here, as it is a far cry from most contemporary vampire films. Klaus Kinski's performance as the meek and paltry Dracula is memorable for its evocation of total despair. Isabelle Adjani is decent, although I actually found her understated and somewhat eccentric performance to be a bit single-note; she's done far better in her career, but she's not bad by any means. Bruno Gaz is also a solid presence as the hero-turned-victim, Jonathan Harker.Overall, "Nosferatu the Vampyre" is an aesthetic accomplishment that is completely visually absorbing. Herzog wrings atmosphere from every shot and musical cue, and the film is unforgettable for that. It is unusually slow-moving, so it's not something that can really be casually-viewed. In any event, it is a hazy and quietly unnerving film, and one of the best horror remakes to date. Memorable scene: the Count's initial intrusion into Lucy's room?check out the cinematography. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hypnotic masterpiece !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On many occasions, Werner Herzog has said that according to him, F.W. Murnau's 'Nosferatu, a Symphony of Horror' from 1922 is the greatest German film ever made. So when he decided to make a remake of the aforementioned film in 1979, it was out of respect for the original. When someone watches Herzog's 'Nosferatu the Vampyre', you can clearly see that Herzog is certainly paying an homage to Murnau. The basic plot is loosely the same. There are some shots in the film that are composed and framed exactly like the original. However, having said that, 'Nosferatu the Vampyre' is also a Werner Herzog film through and through. One can feel Herzog's presence in every scene of the film.Murnau himself had changed the plot a whole lot from the book to make his film. He had introduced the plague element which was not present in the book, he had introduced the sacrificial element in the story that marks the end of the original film. Now Herzog borrows of a lot of these changes that Murnau brought in, but he also expands on them. He puts his own touch to every aspect of the film. Herzog also brought in a few changes on his own mostly through the style of direction and storytelling. The character of Nosferatu played by Max Schreck in the original silent film is like a creepy insect. But Nosferatu in Herzog's film exudes a sense of sadness, a sense of loneliness, a sense of pain. He is still creepy and scary when he needs to be. The connection between the arrival of the vampire and arrival of the plague can be seen to be metaphoric, just like in the original film. But the way Herzog treats this angle of the plague in the film is nothing short of genius. The way he shoots the rats, the way he choreographs and composes the scenes which depict the effect of the plague on the people in the city is nothing short of sublime. Herzog also introduces his own element of a form of PTSD in the plot of the film. Jonathan completely undergoes a change and a transformation after going into the heart of darkness and on returning, he ceases to remain what he used to be.Herzog has said that one of his primary intentions while making the film was to create a surreal, 'separate reality' as he thought a vampire film can't be made by firmly grounding it in reality. Not only do I agree with his opinion, but I also feel he managed to completely execute what he set out to. Herzog has always had the DNA of a documentary filmmaker in his blood. He can't help but capture nature in all its glory as well as in all its darkness. About 10 minutes of our time in the film is spent accompanying Jonathan as he makes the journey to Count Dracula's castle. Herzog takes his time to show us the gradual shift in the nature of the environment from beautiful greenery to creepy and grim darkness as Jonathan moves closer and closer to Dracula's castle. The shot composition and visual framing in the film is second to none. I can talk about so many shots that completely blew me away like the shot where Nosferatu walks towards the camera in a dark tunnel and then the blue light falls on his face or the uninterrupted shot where the ship with Nosferatu and the rats arrives at the dock or the overhead shot of the coffins being carried away in a line or the shot where the camera captures the horse drawn carriage as it moves ahead with its reflection falling in the water body right next to the path on which it is moving,etc. Herzog masterfully uses the hypnotic music provided by Popol Vuh to elevate a lot of the scenes to the ultimate heights of surrealism. There is also the usage of some classical music from time to time. There is a sort of a montage towards the last third of the film where Herzog visually shows us the effect of the plague on the spirit of the people in this town by only using Popol Vuh's music and that sequence is one of the most overwhelming and beautiful sequences that I have ever seen in any film.Klaus Kinski is pretty much flawless as Nosferatu. As soon as he appears, one can see the pain, the sadness in his eyes. His line delivery is precise. His body movements are peculiar and totally sell his non-human physical nature. When Kinski delivers the lines regarding Nosferatu's sadness about having to live on endlessly without being loved by anyone, without being accepted by anyone, I felt for him. I never felt anything emotionally for Schreck's Nosferatu. Isabelle Adjani is gorgeous, but somehow she can also make her face look scary and her over-the-top performance was clearly an homage to the silent era. She shifts from one emotion to another effortlessly. Bruno Ganz underplays the role of Harker. He remains subtle, but comes into his own and shows his acting skills in the second half of the film.Before 'Nosferatu the Vampyre', the other Herzog films that I had watched are 'The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser' which I really liked and 'Aguirre, the Wrath of God' which I think is another masterpiece. 'Nosferatu the Vampyre' has a bit of a link with 'Aguirre, the Wrath of God' as both films involve human beings venturing into areas of darkness that they are unfamiliar with and they end up becoming a shadow of their former selves as a consequence. I am slowly falling in love with Herzog's hypnotic style of storytelling which involves making full use of music, the presence of nature and verbal silence. Herzog is slowly climbing up my list of favourite filmmakers of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think I've ever felt quite so emotionally involved in a vampire film as with this re-interpretation of the classic silent horror film from 1922. It's slow-moving, but also beautifully photographed and extremely atmospheric. At least two of the performances (Roland Topor's Renfield as well as Kinski) are histrionic - and yet still convincing. I'm a fan of Hammer Films and their very different approach to the same material, but this is the first time I've seen an authentic looking Transylvanian inn and a landlord and landlady who looked the parts. Even Dracula himself (this version uses the original names) is believable - while you're watching the film, you feel this scary but pathetic creature *is* a vampire. The film's climax is powerful and tragic, although let down slightly by the twist at the very end.If you haven't seen this, try to get hold of it - ideally in the German version which, in the words of the director, is "more authentic". Don't expect explicit violence or gore but a "slow burn" and truly original take on the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed Feelings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this film to be a bit of a mixed bag. It has many strengths - thick atmosphere, haunting score, great cinematography, fantastic locations and great set design. Most of all, Klaus Kinski is mesmerizing as Count Dracula. He has such a strong screen presence and everything about him - the way he moves, speaks, stares - it all just works and feels very compelling. He steals every scene he is in to the point where many of the scenes without him feel dull by comparison.And I hate to use that word - dull - but for some reason I couldn't shake it from my mind for some sections of this movie. The pace is slow and brooding, which is something that I tend to like. A lot of my favorite horror films are slow and deliberate, The Shining chief among them. But it's all in the execution, and here I found the slowness to be a bit burdensome. The movie can come off as wooden at times. Apart from Klaus, the acting can be a bit questionable as well, especially with Lucy's character. I'm sure she is just following direction from Herzog, but I found her to be a little blank and unconvincing, which is a pretty major issue considering she is meant to carry essentially the entire second half of the film. There are also some moments that play as hokey: all the members of a bar turn in unison and gasp at the mention of Dracula, characters read aloud about vampires from a book when no one is around etc. However, the scenes that work, absolutely work (and they uniformly involve Klaus). It's worth seeing for those scenes and the nice atmosphere, but I don't think it's a film that I'll be hurriedly returning to any time soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The remake between copy and new creation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many remakes are, strangely enough, not based on the original books, and hardly even on the scenarios written by aid of those books, but simply on the older film. Herzog's "Nosferatu" (1979) is a very good example of that, since it is simply a copy of Murnau's "Nosferatu" (1922) which is not based on Bram Stoker's novel, but on Henrik Galeen's screenplay, whose original version is lost. Murnau's "Faust" is not based on J.W. Von Goethe's "Faust", but on a treatment by Thea Von Harbou from a scenario by Gerhart Hauptmann, which has been newly written by Hans Kayser (and remarkably changed by Murnau)... .Besides (as he usually does) exaggerating all crucial scenes in Murnau's original film, Herzog fills the "gaps" - partly gaps on purpose and partly gaps as a result of lost shots - from the 1922 original film. Herzog's most impressive invention is the return of Hutter from the infirmary. While in Murnau's original, Hutter, who has just escaped the castle of Count Orlok, is weak, but of generally good health, in Herzog's remake, he leaves the infirmary halfway death, and Herzog shows how he is blindly guided by his horse, lying upon it, and like a miracle finally makes it back to Wismar. Another crucial scene that is Herzog's own interpretation is Count Orlok's end. Watching Murnau's original, one does not really understand why "the master is dead", as Knock says, but in Herzog's remake, there is a reason invented why the Count could forget the approaching sunrise.While this is surely one of Herzog's better films, the most serious critic I have to apply is the miscasting of Klaus Kinksi as Nosferatu. I have admired the genial madman Kinski as one of the truly unique and great actors my whole life --- but he is not Nosferatu, not the smooth and slimy and probably sexy and seducing Kraken-like anti-hero as whom Herzog portrays the Count.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plague</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Werner Herzog made his tribute to the film that he considers the greatest ever to come out of his country Germany with this 1979 version of the classic Bram Stoker's Dracula. I haven't read Bram Stoker's Dracula however I do have seen some of the films based on it including F. W. Murnau's Nosferatu, a film that I had recently watched again and that I love. Of course Herzog's version is not new for me in the way of knowing it however just last night I finally watched it. First of all we can't really compare this version with the one of 1922 to say which film is better for obvious reasons, everything behind the 1922 version is really interesting, but if we judge Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht just for what it is we will found a superb vampire film and absolutely a superb remake. If we compare both films in terms of the content of the story we will find few differences apart of the obvious longer sequences of this one and the names of the characters obviously. So is the same fascinating story that features the horrors of one man (Bruno Ganz) when he finds out the truth about the Count Dracula (brilliantly played by Klaus Kinski), the pain and loneliness of the Count and the love story. Again we have the symbolism of the plague. The Count Dracula was the plague, the only one who was aware of that was be seeing as a crazy person having just fantasies but after all she was Count Dracula's weakness, she was the way to keep awake the Count when there was light. In this version we also watch more about the consequences that suffered Jonathan Harker after his encounter with the Count to end having a brutal and great conclusion for this character. Klaus Kinski is simply brilliant making this tribute to Max Schreck's unforgettable version of the Count. Kinski's performance is also a gem. Practically and honestly I just know Bruno Ganz for portraying Adolf Hitler in the 2004 film Der Untergang. Here he did a great work and if you, like me, just know Ganz for Der Untergang of course he will look practically unrecognizable and that's speaks very good of Ganz. The other performance that I really liked is the one of Roland Topor as Renfield; the most annoying performance, of course that was the intention. For a fact, Klaus Kinski portrayed Renfield 9 years before in Jess Franco's Count Dracula.A highly recommend film; it was great to finally watch it and better just after watching again F. W. Murnau's Nosferatu. 9.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A potential, contemporary allegory, rich in atmosphere but difficult to appreciate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this particular film back to back with Eisenstein's Oktyabr (1928), and the fact that I did, somehow helped me to better appreciate Herzog's particular experiments with the film and his unique approach to it. It has always been my theory that this film is less about exploring the vampire mythology previously rendered on film so many times before, and more to do with the idea of exploring the disintegration of post WWII Germany and the soulless abyss left in the wake of Hitler and the Third Reich. Herzog himself has even said that the intention behind the film grew from the idea that his generation of German filmmakers were a "generation without fathers", in the respect that the previous generation of directors had either submitted to the lure of the Nazi party or abandoned their country completely. Herzog has in mind an interesting philosophy, and one that would lend itself to varying layers of reference, from Bram Stoker's original (and best) rendition of the Dracula myth, to the expressionist realms of F.W. Murnau's classic silent film, Nosferatu; a Symphony of Horror (1922).The film is characteristic of Herzog's work, to an extent; recalling elements of the period look of greater films like The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser (1974) and Heart of Glass (1976), as well as the more intense film that he had previously made with Kinski, Aguirre, The Wrath of God (1972). As always with Herzog, the film becomes a battle between these two separate elements, in this instance, a battle between an actor and director clearly attempting to make two very different films. Kinski is trying (and to some extent succeeding) to create the most realistic and humanistic vampire that modern day cinema has ever seen - with the defeat, desperation and occasional flicker of frailty presenting us with a Dracula very much worn down by the natural requirements of their existence - whilst Herzog is busy filling his images with an impassioned openness, a preoccupation with spatial, architectural presentation and a cinema of landscapes. The only time the two forces come together is in the creation of a melancholic detachment apparent in both the acting and design, but overall, we never get the feeling that the film fits together quite as well as it could have done.In this respect, I would compare the experiment to Tarkovsky's adaptation of Solaris (1972), another film that saw the consequences of a highly-personal and poetic filmmaker attempting to apply their own unique vision alongside the broader conventions of. It's not a bad film by any means, but certainly it is something of a problematic adaptation of the vampire myth and one of the least successful films that Herzog produced during this most prolific and rewarding period of his career. Where it succeeds is clearly in the creation of a grand, Gothic atmosphere and the director's surreal visions of plagues, pestilence and death. This gives way to a number of vividly impressive moments of pure, visual film-making; for example, the sight of the majestic flagship drifting silently down the street-side canal - and over-flowing with plague ridden rats - recalling that stunning scene from Aguirre with Kinski's raft overrun by rampaging monkeys, or a grinning and salivating Renfield held central to the frame by two mannequin like police officers.More astounding is the depiction of the town stricken with illness and death, with its decomposing fruit and rancid meat lining the gutters and Kinski stalking the streets like an anaemic old man. It is here that Herzog creates a further coalition between his film and the more subtle rendering of the Holocaust, with coffins lining streets, the bereft searching through corpses for their missing relatives, houses boarded up and tables dressed for banquets left completely ignored. It is within these images that we finally see the subtle, subconscious blending of Herzog's polemic in complete contrast with Kinksi's desire to create a Dracula that is threatening and pathetic in equal measures; an idea that will lead us to that ironic final and the general off-kilter, fairytale-like feeling that film creates throughout. However, what really flaws this film for me is the continual sense of Herzog building to an intelligent and interesting idea that never fully develops. Simply, the film for me lacks the personal touch and sense of passion and drive found in the filmmaker's better films from the same period.It didn't shock me like Even Dwarfs Started Small (1970), nor did it truly affect me on an emotional level like The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser, Stroszek (1977) or his following film with Kinski, Woyzeck (1979); a literary adaptation done right. However, with that said, the film still has some interesting elements in keeping with those much greater works. It may be inconsistent, and it may not work as a conventional vampire film (or even as a conventional Herzog film), but like Oktyabr, this is a picture that is filled with passion and rage; a film that masks it's ideals under an air of artistic creativity, that is never less than political. Had I not discovered this similarity then I, like the majority of commentators here, may have been even more critical of Herzog's bold departures, his literary bastardisations and his use of that slow, lingering pace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Werner Herzog's Nosferatau takes the vampire story to new heights...or depths, if you will.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Werner Herzog takes Murnau's classic film and goes beyond it to create a film of dark beauty and haunting images. The pace is slow, bringing the viewer slowly to its stunning conclusion. Fans of the original novel will be glad to see that Werner Herzog's version there are a few nods to the novel, such as having a minor character named Mina, yet this remains primarily a film based on Murnau's Nosferatau. Klaus Kinski and Isabelle Adjani shine in their roles, and Isabelle Adjani's Lucy is a character of remarkable inner strength.The film seems to take place in a dreamworld, as Herzog himself discusses in the audio commentary, where the peaceful world Lucy and Jonathan inhabit at the beginning of the movie first gives way to the eerie labyrinthine castle of Dracula, and then to the plague-ridden wreck of the world Lucy used to inhabit, as Dracula's arrival turns a world of life into one of death.Words cannot describe the beauty of this masterpiece of imagery and sound. Truly the best of the vampire films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dracula Reinterpreted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of Dracula, in all its many forms, is an ever-evolving twist on a cooperatively fabled tradition, gaining new meaning and significance with each passing generation, adding unforeseen observations while subtracting antiquated interpretations, embracing shifting cultural norms while rejecting obsolescent generalizations. The extracted meaning of the story is quite frequently relative to the respective historical era of the audience; the original intent may remain unaltered, but like any good story, the morals remain of a highly elastic nature, dependent upon the beliefs and customs of those retelling the tale to those who will someday contribute their own unique perspective to the flexible fabrication. When F.W. Murnau adapted the tall tale to the silver screen in 1920, his understanding of the source material strongly corresponded to the written story's rudimentary purpose, by all accounts available. Nosferatu was nothing short of a condemnation of restricted sexual and social mores, castigating the obstructionist cultural values of late Victorian society. In 1979, Werner Herzog radically reinterpreted the base meaning of Count Dracula's existence, substituting the outdated social quips and misgivings with a postmodernist critique of faith and spirituality. Dracula no longer symbolized the consequences of a reclusive, conservative existence, but rather came to symbolize the unavoidable fate of humanity, transforming a plea for social reformation into a derisively nihilistic dismissal of humanity's capacity and willingness to change.Herzog's unmistakably cynical recreation envisions a society plagued by the interminable materialization of death, disease and despair. A world inhabited by aimless creatures not so dissimilar from the scurrying harbingers of pestilence and remorse carelessly wandering the remains of the earth. A world depleted of rhyme or reason, pattern or resonance, purpose or order. A world without God, left to the unthinking impulses of man's actions, without reward or consequence, damnation or salvation. A world where man's prayers are left unanswered, where strength is found in the acceptance of futility, and death is welcomed as the cure to eternal suffering. Nosferatu, in this context, is portrayed as the omnipresent force behind this movement, offering a merciful escape from an unimaginably bleak existence characterized by incessant adversity and hardship, unrestrained anguish and imperishable misery. In Herzog's unremittingly cruel and fruitlessly illogical universe, God is dead and man is left to elicit meaning from a crumbling empire of greed and pain, anger and destruction. This absurdist dilemma challenges us to find a source of resolve within a maze of hollow vanity, to find hope and ambition among the barren plains of a forgotten wasteland, to derive meaning from the meaningless and substance from the insubstantial. In Herzog's estimation, the story of Nosferatu is nothing less than a reaffirmation of our greatest apprehension; the possibility of an unrequited existence distinguished by recurring dreams of a benign release, and the unforgiving reality of our idle banality.In Herzog's contemporary rendering, Nosferatu no longer symbolizes the impersonal forces of a corrupt civil society, nor does he signify the authoritarian impulses of social conformity. Nosferatu is, quite simply, the replacement for humanity's absent benevolent savior, the merciful anti-Christ who offers a desperately desired emancipation from incessant anguish and intemperate ill fortune. Herzog ingeniously transforms the story of Nosferatu from outdated social commentary into existential spiritual inquiry, neglecting the comparatively minute grievances of an antique society in favor of a much larger denouncement, targeting the very foundation of our moral structure rather than frivolously striking at the inconsequential details. Herzog's captivating rendition questions the very purpose of our being, unreservedly depicting an environment destitute of any resemblance of a higher order or objective, reducing all of life's catastrophes to a frivolous monotony of unregenerable tribulations. The unforgettable conclusion further reinforces this twisted vision; Lucy's unselfish decision to give her own life in return for her husband's renewal is ultimately coordinated entirely in vain, as the irredeemable circle of misfortune continues to spin into the unrewarding grasps of eternity, enclosing the hopes and dreams of fate's unfortunate victims into the vise of perpetuity.It is hardly coincidental that Kinski's Nosferatu is not a frighteningly unidentifiable monster, but rather an empathetic symbol of human misery, loneliness, perplexity and emptiness. Herzog's Dracula may be immortal, but his deepest fixations and feelings are recognizably human rationalizations. Just as the world's mortal inhabitants must suffer through an incomparable endurance of unbroken anxiety and unappreciated tragedy, Nosferatu must abide by the fate of the undead, forced to passively subsist in an intolerable world of melancholy for centuries upon centuries, living a life of solitude amidst a static universe of predictable fortune. The reason Herzog depicted Nosferatu as such a distinguishably fragile specimen is rather simple; Nosferatu is nothing short of a reflection of our own blackish identity, representing the worst in humanity and the most brooding truth of our most basic reality. Herzog's Nosferatu is the image that we cast upon the clearest of mirrors during our darkest of moments, the unspoken understanding of our most disreputable possibilities, and the evocation of our unequivocal destiny. Herzog's modern revisionism of the Dracula fable is the most deeply depressing, discouraging recitation imaginable. It shows no hope for the future of humanity, and takes great delight in doing so. It is a coldly seditious interpretation of popular folklore, replacing the superficial scares of a cartoonish monster with the realistic dread of a vacuous universe indifferently inhabited by the waking dead. While some may turn to the Dracula tale for cheap thrills and fleeting yells, Herzog found the basis for a story about the death of spiritual conviction, and the birth of modernity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One reason why is the underplayed - wonderful - music score by prog band Popol Vuh. Another is Herzogs visual skills, he really is second to none in framing pictures. Lighting is natural or heavily colored, but never unfitting. The movie is slow moving, making room for some of the chilliest scenes I have ever seen, letting the atmosphere creep in on you. And I never got a real impression of the hinterlands in the other films. Here you get no cheap effects, only film-making of the highest order.Who could surpass Max Shreck from the original?

		<fullReview>Long, dark, moody, sometimes plodding but often atmospheric and even occasionally funny remake of the silent classic "Nosferatu" that starred Max Shreck as Dracula. Here it is Klaus Kinski in platform shoes as Count Dracula and he's out to claim Jonathan Harker's beautiful wife for himself as she so greatly reminds him of his lover from centuries ago. Also features rats galore.It may not be the greatest vampire film ever made, but it certainly grabs your attention in many places with it's bad ass atmosphere and creepy music. Also there are rats galore and that's enough to bother most people right there.One of the creepiest bits of the film is the horrible and even by today's standards unexpected fate of Jonathan Harker himself - I can honestly say I didn't see that one coming: I mean, he became a freaking vampire at the end! Klaus Kinski is a good vampire, though the fanged buck teeth are kind of laughable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A straight remake of F.W.Murnau's original chilling terror story, or is it? Herzog wanted to remake this classic tale, as a tribute to Murnau and to German Expressionism. To cut to the chase, it does not work.Kinski plays a very lonely Vampire. He is very humane in the film, and we are led to feel sympathy for a character, who is suposed to terrify us. Herzog loves to show nature in all its splendour, and implied in this film, is that Vampires are merely part of nature and natural humane beings. We are also led to think that the Vampire, is a form of a disease, and it can be passed on through the bite, as it is at the end of the film. Yet a natural being, is confined by supernatural means?It is a clever idea, and a very ambitious one, but it does not appeal at all to me. Herzog does not pull it off, and we are left with a very dull and boring sympathetic horror</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're familiar with the films of Werner Herzog then you'll know what to expect from this film. It's slow, beautifully photographed with a strangely unsettling atmosphere.It's a very faithful re-make of the 1922 FW Murnau movie, with some shots from the earlier film being mirrored almost exactly in this one. Klaus Kinski (acting under very heavy make-up) plays the vampire as a lonely old man, longing for death. The movie looks beautiful, and (while it isn't very scary) it does have a unique atmosphere.However, it does require a lot of patience and I think that many viewers, who come to the film expecting a conventional vampire movie will be disappointed. I for one, though, think that it is well worth the effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kinski's performance is unforgettable as he seems to make the vampire a believable beast. Compared to Oldman in Coppolas film, this vampire has real tangible power and one is left with the sense that he is indeed cursed to walk the earth. Herzog manages to make us sympathise with the vampire and he depicts him as a sick parasitic shell of what was once a man. The setting and locations in this film give it a great sense of place and add so much to the feel of the film. Herzog also uses silence a great deal which is effective in displaying the barren world inhabited by the Count. Kinski becomes part of the castle framed by arched doorways as he stalks his prey through the castle corridors creeping up on the camera with heavy breathing. A mesmerising performance from Kinski as he moves like a spider slowly and carefully towards his next fix of blood. A great piece of work that is of an equal footing with the 1922 original, although if I was pushed I would probably go with this one. It is chilling to the bone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Nosferatu" takes a lot of heat because it is a remake, and many of the scenes are very similar to the original. But all in all, I find this version superior. Both feature powerful images, but this version's are more breathtaking. The performances are uniformly superb, with Kinski delivering a masterful performance as Dracula, drawing both disgust and sympathy from the viewer. The period detail is second to none, providing beautiful images of the German towns, countryside, and castles. While it is not frightening in the common sense of the word, it is overflowing with creepy atmosphere that has been matched by virtually no horror film before or since. Anybody who thinks that "Scream" and "The Others" are some of the greatest horror movies ever made should watch this film and see how one is supposed to be made.</fullReview>

All this film is nothing but a remake of Nosferatu, except for the fact that this movie is in colour and has sound. The one thing that this film does have which was to my liking was Isabelle Adjani who gave a memorable performance as Lucy Harker.

		<fullReview>Werner Herzog's Nosferatu the Vampyre (1979) is a must-have for fans of the genre. This is a great movie for those lonely nights due to the fact that it has a surreal feel to the movie. If you're a fan of flicks like "Mark of the Devil," this one is for you. This gem stars Klaus Kinski revamping the classic role of Dracula in a gothic style. This film was not billed as a remake, but rather a "rebirth." We won't go into details about the plot and storyline because it might ruin the finale. We have noticed that this film is VERY hard to find. Our searches on all the major search engines only returned a handful of entries. Also known as "Nosferatu - fantme de la nuit" in France and the plain title "Nosferatu" in the USA. It runs 107 minutes and has mono sound. Get this movie!</fullReview>

Nosferatu (1922) is such a good movie I don't know if the original Dracula could be better. I can believe that is it is better then crap. It is badly written and has an awful ending. You have to be under 7 to really get scared of this movie. Which it disappointing considering that the 1922 version is one of the scariest movies ever made. Do not see this movie.

		<fullReview>The original 'Nosferatu (1922)' remains one of the greatest early films. However, possibly feeling that some aficionados might be put off by the understandably scratchy quality, German director Werner Herzog set about recreating the atmosphere original.For the pivotal character of Dracula, or Count Orlok, Herzog cast his friend, the mighty Klaus Kinski, who brings an incredible haunted intensity to a role that seemed to be made for him. Whether staring longingly at Harker's bleeding hand, or his bride Lucy, or snapping into inhuman speed due to his blood-lust, Kinski shines like a beacon in every single scene. It truly is an unearthly performance, he is probably the creepiest vampire of them all.There were two versions shot of this; an English and a German version. Perhaps because English is not the actors' native tongue, only Kinski emerges with a believable performance. Other members of the cast do well to sustain the slightly 'removed' atmosphere vital to such a dreamlike horror, but the acting does occasionally stray into wooden territory.And yet everything else is wonderfully ethereal. Harker's journey, Dracula's arrival by boat at the Varna seaport, the infestation of plague rats, the vibrant but desolate town, the choice of location and architecture ? all these things come together to make a truly spooky film. Happily, the ending doesn't strive to placate the viewer, as Harker ? one of the few survivors of the story ? begins to look a little unwell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Things More Horrible Than Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Herzog's Nosferatu, the color cinematography seeps into your pores just looking at it. It's vivid, oily, both real and illusory. Things look cold and dirty. There isn't a lot of green, and it looks wet. Interiors are filmed in bold reds, browns and whites. It's a film of remarkable visual creepiness.There's always something intimidating and awe-inspiring in Herzog's portraiture of the world. And here, shadows truly convey fear. The provincial bumpkins that Jonathan Harker meets en route to Dracula's castle are not quaint or idiosyncratic. They recoil from him. Herzog takes his time before first showing Dracula. He sets the stage with words and looks from people who can't believe he's seeking the Count.Bruno Ganz, some 25 years before playing Hitler, owns the first third of the movie, playing Harker. His pilgrimage takes a lot more time than in the many other movies based on the Dracula legend. Herzog takes his time heightening anticipation before Dracula's entrance.And once Klaus Kinski's Count does appear, it then takes some time getting over how he appears. He looks more like a bat than a person. His face and bald skull are pure white. His fingernails are spears, his ears are pointed, his eyes are deep-set. In most movies Dracula's fangs are longer versions of the ones we all have. Here, there can be no mistaking them in the center of his mouth.Herzog is the most original of filmmakers, not much prone to remakes. Why was he beckoned to remake one of the most iconic and legendary silent films? I think it was mainly because he had Klaus Kinski. Opposite him is cast Isabelle Adjani, a French beauty whose angelic looks provide a virginal target for Dracula's fangs.But their performances aren't so much honed to perfection as they are products of having been born to play these figures in this story. Nosferatu is genuinely creepy largely owing to Herzog's command of the color palate, his offbeat compositions and expressive contrast of light and dark. Nosferatu is a film that does justice to the corporal substance of vampires. If they were for real, this is how they would look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Klaus Kinski... Bringer of DOOM!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing that should be made clear to every cinema-fan who considers watching Herzog's "Nosferatu" is to AVOID all language-dubbed versions! To see the formidable Klaus Kinski is always a great pleasure, but to hear him talk in a dubbed voice is just downright atrocious and almost a crime against nature! No matter how beautiful the cinematography and filming locations remain, seeing this film in a wrong language can simply ruin everything. That being said, Herzog's interpretation of the legendary Dracula story is a very, very strange movie! This shouldn't surprise anybody, as this director ? as well as his regular protagonist Klaus Kinski ? upholds his eccentric reputation with every movie he completes, but still this is one of the weirdest projects in the history of the horror genre. Even though Bram Stoker's Dracula tale spawned a whole lot of different film versions, Herzog's film is a direct remake of the silent F.W. Murnau classic of 1922. That film is generally considered as one of the all-time greatest genre classics and thus it was quite an ambitious and even perilous idea of Herzog to update it. The tone and atmosphere are very similar to the original film, meaning that Count Dracula is portrayed as a dismal and almost piteous creature that lives in total isolation and exclusively longs for some (female) affection. He is, however, the bringer of doom, forced to feed on human blood and always surrounded by an army of ravenous rats. Young Jonathan Harker, played by Bruno Ganz who recently startled the world with his mesmerizing performance of Adolf Hitler in "Der Untergang", is assigned to travel to Dracula's remote castle in the mountains of Transylvania and present him the buying contracts for a house in Wismar. Upon seeing a picture of Harker's lovely wife Lucy (that's right, NOT Mina), the Count gets obsessed with her image. He puts a spell on Jonathan and prepares his own journey to Wismar, accompanied by his army of rats that carry around the plague. It's most remarkable how, in this film version, Dracula's terror affects an entire town! Not just Jonathan Harker and his wife Lucy suffer, but the coming of Nosferatu (= bringer of plagues) threatens the whole population of Wismar. The most intense sequences of the film involve long rows of people carrying the coffins of their departed family members or the increasing mass-hysteria among the last survivors. Other than for the fascinating modifications in the basic screenplay, "Nosferatu" is highly recommended viewing for the staggering photography. Werner Herzog's talented &amp; detailed eye for beautiful landscape images widely surpasses every other horror director's visions and this is easily the artiest vampire movie ever filmed. Harker's journey through Transylvania, with its fog-enshrouded nights and uncanny mountain roads, is paralyzing to observe and the ominous images of Dracula's somber castle are equally impressive. Klaus Kinski is indescribably brilliant, as always, and thus far the ONLY actor whose charisma alone sends cold shivers of fear down my spine. His performance, along with the photography and not to forget the masterful use of music, all contribute in making this one of the most unique horror films of the 70's decade. It has some flaws too, but they're mere details and really insignificant compared to all the great aspects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing the 1922 version and this version their really isint that big of a difference. This version is more than a hour longer than the original one and has more of the same material, in fact Murnay in some scences i thought did a more creative job than scences in Herzog film. The film drags and is boring especially for one like myself and others who have already seen the original and know the story by heart so the movie lacks originality. Max Schreak was played in a more mysterious way than Klaus and the apperance of Nosferatu became more intimidating in the original.What makes this movie worth seeing is the well done inspiring cinematography which uses a clever use of lighting. The music which was the aspect of the movie that should have been the most improve wasent that well done. It would have been a better movie with a more frighting score which the original lack because it's a silent movie. Another thing good about this movie is that it's more sexual than the original which the other one tried to show but did it in such a discrete way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possibly the greatest remake of any film ever made. It pays a bit more attention to style, visuals, and atmosphere than an actual plot (although a plot is, of course, still there), and it does this very well, rather than being a mess. However, many people will dislike this movie, but that is probably because they dislike Herzog's signature style. But who could blame them? his films are very weird and, sometimes, even experimental.However, I, personally, had a great time watching this film. It isn't as scary as it is unsettling and creepy. The entire film has an off putting, almost disturbing, atmosphere, but it balances this creepiness with some dark comedy throughout. Like in most Herzog films, the humour is absurd and a relief from all of the really dark subject matter and feeling that the rest of the film contains. The film is also full of beautiful imagery. It includes time lapse photography, and a lot of creepy and visually pleasing locations.This is one of the great horror films, and one of the only remakes that I can say is truly better than the original (even though the original is already a wonderful film, and one of the most frightening of all time). The beauty of the locations, mixed with the unsettling atmosphere, great Klaus Kinski performance, and subtle humorous touches, create one of the best Herzog films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Along with "Fitzcarraldo", Werner Herzog's "Nosferatu" is probably one of his best movies in co-operation with the charismatic acting legend Klaus Kinsky, who convinces and stuns the audience in his role as a bloody and lonesome vampire from Transylvania. Those who know Murnau's original from 1922 will notice that Herzog's version is almost identical concerning storyline, settings, characters and the plot. Only cuts and dialogs are quite different, apart from a few scenes which had been added at the ending. One aspect typical of Herzog's movies is the scenery and wildlife cuts that he includes - this somehow imparts a nostalgic image that matches perfectly with the melancholic scenery of Germany and Romania. A brilliant entertainment for vampire- and Herzog fans alike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(84%) Without doubt one of the better Dracula based movies ever put to film. It's certainly up there with Universal's classic, Hammer's, or pretty much anything else, even Blade 3. The opening is one of out and out horror with really hideous looking deformed mummified corpses that marks one of the sharpest descents into terror ever, but thankfully for the squeamish there's some footage of fluffy kittens playing to balance out the dread. This follows the actual Dracula story quite well, and like the novel the best part is Jonathan Harker making his way toward the count and his grim fate. Klaus Kinski's is superb as the foul monster, and even though I found him very amusing in parts there's still something very creepy about the design. The stunning Isabelle Adjani is also fantastic as Lucy Harker who fits the role better than anyone else could. The only issue here is the fact that this is at its best in the first half, while the second is just not as strong, but overall this is a must-watch for all followers of Dracula: the dirty old man.</fullReview>

Upon seeing a photo of Lucy, Jonathan's wife, he makes the trip - with death following in his footsteps.Remakes to me can turn out in many different way's if you look at it's history of films. There are remakes that are known has classic and way better than the original and it's films like: John Carpenter's The Thing and the 1986 film The Fly that's been kept in everybody's hearts has one of the greats. But when there's good there's always bad and boy do we have some unspeakably bad remakes out there like..well every remake that ever came out around the late 90's or the early 2000's. Remakes seem to everywhere now if it's horror, Sci-Fi, action or drama you can't escape of what I like to call it The Curse of the Remade.But Nosferatu the Vampyre ( Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht ) in my opinion is the best remake I've seen since The Fly and here's why.The movie's atmosphere and it's slow build up suspense is the top key things that made this movie kind of chilling at times and really glued me to the big screen with those two supporting the film. That's what makes a great horror movie, no stupid and annoying jump scars, no mindless blood and gore, just a creepy setting and the atmosphere around the movie really hold up the film Has I already said before.Klaus Kinski who played Nosferatu did probably did one of the best performance in this movie. He got the character so perfectly well that it's like the actor is doing a small little tribute to Max Schreck original role in the 1922 film, and a awesome tribute it was.Now for problems: ....Overall Nosferatu has brilliant directing, the acting from everyone was great, the cinematography was some of the best I've seen and the sets &amp; designs was just perfect in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Dracula Were Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jonathan and Lucy live in Wismar and the Count (Klaus Kinski) wants a house there. Varna is a port on the Black Sea, close to Dracula's castle.Werner Herzog had always been fascinated by Murnau's "Nosferatu" and has said he thinks it is the all-time greatest German film (a strong statement, all things considered). With his talent and crew, he was the right person to recreate that iconic film, making it look better than ever.While this is clearly a horror film and clearly a remake (with some modifications), it is also an art film. The use of the bat footage (though not Herzog's) is dreamlike, and there are more than a few shots of scenery that another director would never have included. The movie stresses the beauty of the landscape as much as the pestilence of Dracula and his plague.Why Lucy and Mina were switched is unclear, and the use of Renfield seems played down more than it ought to be. Besides Dracula, the Renfield role provides for the most acting fun. Here, it amounts to little more than a man who giggles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nosferatu: The Vampire I just got Werner Herzog's Nosferatu: The Vampyre (Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht). I'm 30 mins in &amp; I can tell you this is a marvelous Dracula movie It is faithful to the source material (except for the closing scene)but with Herzog at the controls &amp; color available (though little used) it is the visual embodiment of the story of Dracula. Herzog is the world's best Documentarian &amp; you wouldn't think that would lead to great fiction. In his case it does. He directed Aguirre: The Wrath of God &amp; Fitzcarraldo along with many others including, Signs of Life. It's images, images, images conceived in such a way as to perfectly portray his subject matter &amp; give rise in his viewer to what is going on in that character mentally &amp; emotionally. No one is his equal at this. Back to the movie which anyone would not believe a man whose fame grew from documentaries would be capable of in a horror story. This is Halloween the holiday in a disc folks.Finished it &amp; I must say what an achievement. There is not one scene of violence in the whole movie unless you call Jonathan Harker nicking his finger at the dinner table violence. The ending scene strangely does not remotely follow the book &amp; I will dock it a full point. 1/2 for not following the book &amp; 1/2 because to me, the ending scene is the weakest part of the story. Dracula seems to be completely unaware of when crosses (supposed to cause Dracula great pain) are in the scene. Dracula carries his coffin through a graveyard of crosses with no reaction then, when he puts his coffin down he turns &amp; sees 2 that are 1/10 the size &amp; cowers. When Dracula visits Lucy in her bedroom she is wearing a silver cross (extremely potent) but Dracula has no reaction again. I don't understand or forgive that. It is the first mistake of that magnitude I've seen in any of his films.I can just hear the world's blood &amp; gore horror crowd complaining about this atmospheric &amp; apprehensive Dracula. The opening scene is perhaps the finest in the Horror genre. There is no blood at all to speak of. There is no crescendo after crescendo of horror. What there is is an oppressive &amp; brooding sense of evil that is eminent, which never goes away, but carries throughout the common scenes as well as the uncommon encounters. I loved it. 8.5 out of 10 stars. Did I mention I was PO'ed about the crosses? Except for that though, the scene construction is superbly Herzog. I loved his use of music too.XXXXXXXXXXXXXMy wife came home early to say, "Let's watch Nosferatu with Klaus. I allowed my arm to be twisted. I also came up with another dissatisfaction. It's the character of Van Helsing. I understand they were intent on showing Dracula as a sympathetic character &amp; to have a monomaniacal foe of all that's holy would be counterproductive. The milk-toast they make of him though is just wrong. This one is not the Dr. that rides in as help in a time of trouble. He is rather the epitome of the country Dr. Many have done this story with no Van Helsing at all &amp; I think that would have been better. Keep the character that they used but don't call him Van Helsing. I'll deduct another 1/2 point for that &amp; make it 8 out of 10 stars after a second viewing. As my wife said after seeing it, "Aguirre was 10 out of 10. This one isn't, yet the imagery is as good &amp; the brooding evil never leaves." Nosferatu: The Vampyre (English version) On my disc it isn't cut at all. Not even one scene. The English version comes from a dirtier source print. Snow is bad at the beginning &amp; slowly fades for about 20-25 mins then it is gone. I didn't notice a whole lot of camera angle changes but what was evident was an overall use of slightly less light. You can really see that in the back-lighting of Count Dracula as he walks down the corridor to Jonathon Harker's room. It is noticeable throughout however. It steals the sheen off of fabrics causing it to appear less contrast was used. The ending doesn't change at all.My wife pointed out &amp; I agree that Shadow of the Vampire is better done but not by much. Max Schreck in that is as eerie &amp; imposing with more latitude given for intensity. Willem Defoe against Klaus Kinski is a "can't lose" match on maniacal expression &amp; I'll see both of these many times over the years. Imagery goes to Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht but consistency of storyline goes to Shadow of the Vampire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht, or Nosferatu the Vampyre for English speaking audiences, starts with a terrific &amp; eerie opening montage sequence of real mummified bodies from a museum in Guanajuato, Mexico. It's 1850 in the small European picturesque town of Wismar where Jonathan Harker (Bruno Ganz) is told by his boss Mr. Renfield (Roland Topor) that he has received a letter from a Count Dracula (Klaus Kinski) who wants to buy some property in Wismar, Harker is told to travel to Transylvania &amp; finalise the deal. After 4 weeks of travel &amp; despite various ominous warnings from the locals, Harker reaches the castle of Count Dracula a tall, thin, shaven headed pale man with very long fingernails &amp; some sharp teeth. Over the next few days Harker witnesses strange events &amp; discovers Dracula sleeping during the day in a crypt, Harker is locked into the castle &amp; sees Dracula set off with a load of coffins. Harker is convinced Dracula is heading for Wismar &amp; his wife Lucy (Isabelle Adjani), upon Dracula's arrival in Wismar a plague of rats begin to spread a terrible disease throughout the town from which no one is safe as Dr. Van Helsing (Walter Ladengast) looks on helplessly...This German, French co-production was produced, written &amp; directed by Werner Herzog, who also has a small cameo in the film, exists in at least two different versions, both English &amp; German. The version I will be commenting on is the full uncut 2 hour English version released on DVD, I have not seen the German version which is also included as I haven't had time yet. So, with that in mind I will start my review. The script by Herzog based on the novel 'Dracula' by Bram Stoker is a little on the slow side &amp; isn't as straight forward as many vampire films are. There isn't really any significant neck biting or blood drinking, instead Dracula appears to prefer spreading a disease with rats. The English version is also rather slow &amp; somewhat unfocused, at first we think Jonathan will be the hero but at about half-way he is almost completely forgotten about after which his wife Lucy takes centre stage despite her barely featuring until this point. It was quite hard for me to shift alliance's here &amp; I'd have preferred Jonathan to be hero throughout, the story also seems to veer into a completely different direction about half-way with the majority of the start of Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht taking place in Dracula's castle which then switches almost entirely to Wismar for the second half &amp; both these sudden shifts in continuity give the film a sort of disjointed feel, as if two films were edited together. The character's are minimal &amp; aren't given much background but it doesn't matter that much as a lot of Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht is told through imagery. Which brings me nicely to the fantastic cinematography &amp; visual style. Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht is a great film to watch with some great shots &amp; images, from the opening mummies to the way Dracula's shadow seems to have a life of it's own. From the beautiful scenery &amp; landscapes to the gloomy, dark Gothic castle, a superbly shot &amp; thought out film with bags of atmosphere. There is no blood or gore whatsoever which is a bit of a problem in my eyes as I want to see the red stuff in a horror film about a vampire, but maybe that's just me. A word about the music, the main theme is brilliant &amp; I loved it, it really adds something to the film &amp; stands out. The acting varies, Kinski as Dracula is perfect with his little mannerisms like the way he crosses his hands as is his appearance &amp; make-up with his oddly positioned fangs, long fingernails, pale skin, shaven head &amp; large mis-shaped ears, Adjani feels awkward &amp; like she's trying too hard. Everyone else is OK I suppose. I liked Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht more than I though I would, it's not perfect with a poor performance from Adjani &amp; a generally slow &amp; unfocused pace but there are plenty of positive things that make it well worth a watch like the outstanding visual style, Kinski as Dracula, a real dark atmosphere throughout &amp; that cool theme music. Maybe the German version plays better as it's apparently at least 10 minutes shorter, I don't know. Something a bit different &amp; not too bad at all.</fullReview>

I never write film reviews but the ridiculous nature of this disgusting excuse of a vampire film has inspired me to create an account on IMDb and warn all of you who have not seen this film to continue not seeing it. I have just wasted an hour and a half of my life away on a movie that literally made me want to punch every character who touched the screen. Every character lacked logic and the ability to use words at the most dire of times! And nothing made sense! Like little boy who plays violin at Nosferatu's crib? Why wasn't he a prime target?! And where did he even come from?! Ahh! I'm so perturbed! If you want to watch a film that will kill your brain cells, make you want to scream in agony, and wish you'd never wasted a Netflix DVD rental, then this film is for you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a good rendition of the Dracula story. Sloppy production.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only saw the last part of this movie several years ago, but now after seeing the whole thing, I'm glad that I didn't actually pay real money to see this movie. For starters, the entire film moves extremely slow. Also, there are many inconsistencies and scenes that are totally out of place in the film. Example 1 - Harker has arrived at Dracula's castle and appears to be devoid of life - aside from Harker and Dracula. But then a little boy playing a violin appears out of nowhere for no reason. Not just once - but twice. Example 2 - Dracula is about to head back to Harker's home town, and Harker somehow figures it out. When he pursues him, Harker makes a rope out of linen to climb out his window - leading one to believe that he is locked in his room. But in previous scenes, Harker appears to be able to move freely about the house and outside of the house with no problem. Example 3 - Everyone in the town near Dracula's castle is afraid of him, yet Dracula manages to find 3 (or 4)guys to help him transport his coffins on a raft to the ship going to Harker's home town.I also thought that the film was poorly edited...like in the first scene where Harker leaves for Dracula's castle - after kissing Lucy, Harker instantly appears on the horse riding away...no fade or anything in between.It's good for a laugh here and there, but if you really have to see this movie, I would recommend borrowing it from a friend or the library...if you don't mind burning the extra gas to pick it up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Klaus isn't Max</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start by stating I have nothing against artistic vampire movies with Daughters of Darkness and The Hunger being among my favourites. This just didn't do anything to improve or even equal the original 1922 film. Klaus Kinski does not have the screen presence of Max Shreck and his pathetic attempts to imitate him are painful to watch. The scenes of Dracula in his castle in Coppola's Dracula had more a feel of the original Nosferatu than this. I wouldn't say this is a complete waste of time but is just an OK time waster. Certain scenes like a boy playing a violin seem to be thrown in for art effect and have zero relevance to the plot. There are also scenes of a pig walking around for no apparent reason. The ending was also laughable with Harker becoming the vampire. I guess just to make it different from the original. It does have some nice scenery and such but I would say watch Shadow Of A Vampire if you are a fan of the original instead of this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Werner, Popol Vuh absolute art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The soundtrack to this movie is awesome.The most spine-chilling part of the movie for me was, at the early stage when Johnathan (played by Bruno Ganz) travels through the mountain, as he gets closer to Dracula's Castle the music "Brder Des Schattens - Shne Des Lichts" (Brothers of Darkness- Sons of Light) composed and performed by the German group Popol Vuh puts you in a superbly eerie frightening trance. The independent nature of his music has conceptually proved to be a great asset to Herzog's films, which have often a somnambulistic character. This is an other best of about the prolific collaboration with Werner. Nosferatu: Phantom Der Nacht, like its silent inspiration, concentrates on tone and atmosphere, and with the music of Popol Vuh, the result is a superior horror film that offers a greater sense of disquiet than any other Dracula film. This is film art at its best.</fullReview>

I doubt that the forty minutes of storyline footage could even have been edited to make a coherent story.The characterisation was poor and untrue to my recollection of both book and 1929 original.The acting was dire - especially Van Helsing and Lucy.Allowing Jonathan Harker to survive clearly gave them a big problem on how to end the film so the final indignity was having to watch him ride off in full daylight (yes - long shot of someone riding away from camera forever it seems) to presumably become the next Count.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Vicious Circle of a Cursed Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Herzog's great vampire tale has been restored and is readily available on Blu-ray both in North America (released by the Shout! Factory) and in Europe courtesy of the British Film Institute, not to mention the German release. What could be a better time, then, to embark on a little vampire-themed retrospective of three films, all closely related to Bram Stoker's brilliant novel? I first revisited Murnau's original, and after this one will go to Merhige's, whose "Shadow of the Vampire" (2000) is one of the most amazing films of the new century.Capping a remarkable decade in Herzog and Kinski's shared career with "Woyzeck" (1979), "Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht" (1979) is everything one might expect from Herzog: the slow, meditating rhythm and wonder at nature's strength and unexplored and inexplicable vastness, journeying as both a personal trial and a personal triumph, and having us as witnesses as a triumph for cinema.Although this is a remake of sorts of Murnau's film, it stands midway between the novel and Nosferatu. The names are mostly restored to their originals, and Herzog succeeds in giving more time both in the village before Harker's journey to the castle, and in the castle, where he is held captive. Both locations now exhibit real danger, and the moments in the castle are so successfully creepy as they are visceral. "Nosferatu", just as it was in the original, is a curse, but here Herzog gives it an even deeper meaning: a curse that binds one to ultimate loneliness and, in the end, to complete isolation of self, all this misery until the end of time. In this sense this Dracula is something thoroughly different in his ordeals. He becomes an existential creature in the full meaning of the word, not merely a destroyer but a victim of his own destruction, the sufferer in the vicious circle of a cursed life.In this sense Kinski is the perfect Dracula: irresistibly charismatic, strong and authoritarian, tormented and driven. Even when he's off-screen one thinks of him, and when he's in the frame it's impossible to look away from him.The remarkable Bruno Gantz gives a Jonathan Harker who's surprisingly strong and willful, and Herzog has time to give him the cloak of Aguirre the Explorer during his journey to the castle, and the moment with Wagner's "Rheingold", ingeniously used throughout the film, obliterates all sense of danger and death. At that moment, when he's sitting there, watching as the nocturnal nature unfolds around him, is a moment of utter wholeness, completeness that comes from within, and which is then shattered. Both Murnau and Herzog show Harker first as something else, then as something altogether different once the count is done with him. I prefer Herzog's solution to Murnau's pompously irritatingly butch macho, since here Harker is more of a light bearer in himself, a genuinely caring human being, who truly loves his wife. Isabelle Adjani is perfect, too, both as the one who takes matters into her own hands and as the object of desire, which lends extra power to the tragic ending. In fact, it is her that makes it tragic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Klaus Kinski sinks his fangs into Bruno Ganz and Isabelle Adjani</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Nosferatu the Vampyre" is a movie with visual beauty. There are many tableaux in it upon which the camera lingers. They are like paintings showing us a romanticized version of a past that's distant but not too distant. Scenes stick in one's memory because they are so beautiful, and one returns to the film for that reason. Even a horse galloping down a path beside a river is memorable, as are homes along a canal or a ship carried by the current into a canal or the architecture of an old castle.The story is known well and it is more or less faithfully retold, with some unexpected embellishments. Klaus Kinski makes a good vampire. I am again impressed by his acting. At times I thought his makeup looked too much like a mask and not enough like his real skin. I liked it when he made sudden moves on Bruno Ganz and when he approached Ganz and Ganz backed away. I wish there had been more such moments in the movie. The transformation of Ganz was done well and was eerie. Isabelle Adjani was well cast. She conveys an unusual and delicate beauty.The film as a whole is rather flat and listless, that is, lacking in drama. It is more courtly and like a costume drama, not a horror movie that gives one chills and thrills. Even the moments that should be the most psychologically interesting are few in number. This is why overall I rate the film as rather an average film, neither especially an overwhelming one or experience nor a terrible one or flop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A familiar tale, somewhat thematically subverted and boosted hugely by Klaus Kinski</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Time is an abyss." ? Count Dracula With the plot of Bram Stoker's "Dracula" being so familiar, one sees little point in Werner Herzog's "Nosferatu the Vampyre", the German director's remake of F.W. Murnau's classic 1922 silent film, "Nosferatu".Herzog's film possesses neither the iconic imagery of Murnau's, the excitement of Christopher Lee's "Count Dracula" or Peter Cushing's 1958 "Horror of Dracula", the retro-charm of Coppola's "Dracula", or the iconography re-writing allure of Bela Lugosi and Tod Browning's 1931 "Dracula", which changed Dracula from a horrific monster to a suave nobleman.Still, Herzog's film is interesting for a couple reasons. Whilst most Dracula films turn the Count into a charming Hugh Hefner character (which makes sense, as vampirism is largely a form of unhinged sexual hunger), Herzog's film stars the legendary Klaus Kinski as a monstrous creature. Kinski, whose character is bald, has rat fangs, clawed hands, a stiff gait and pointy ears, is of course modelled after Murnau's iconic Dracula, but the actor imbues his Count with traits which all other major Dracula's lack.In this version, Dracula is neither a cultured gentleman, a sadistic monster, nor a romantic lead. Instead, he is a rotting corpse, a twisted parody of masculinity, whose hungers for blood, sex and the monotonous litany of late-night feedings, clash with his nobility, wealth and polite manners. He's a wretch caught between civilisation and something more primal. Something which he fears is hardwired into his very being. A sad, tragic figure, Herzog's Dracula thus longs for the pleasures of death. More specifically, he wants to put Desire to death. Desire, as an unquenchable machine, desires it's own demise, which if course is the death drive writ large.All the faithful Dracula films have a "Lucy" character who sets the Count's hormones ablaze. But here Lucy is played by Isabelle Adjani, not as a damsel in distress, but the true hero of the film. Unlike her character in other Dracula versions, Lucy does not sacrifice herself, rather she tracks the vampire down and destroys his lair.In contrast, the men of the picture are completely incompetent. The famous vampire slayer, Van Helsing, is an elderly, ineffectual old man, and Lucy's fianc, Jonathan, spends the latter half of the film imprisoned by Lucy.Beyond this you have the usual pseudo-sexual vampire themes. Here, the Count's rampant lusts are satisfied only after he bites Lucy, after which they both die, his lusts then passed on to Jonathan, a new breed of vampire/masculinity which is able to show its face in the light. Some feminist writers use the film to highlight a shift in gender roles ? female empowerment, sex no longer a monster never spoken of, but rather, morphing into a kind of free, liberated and public thing ? but Herzog claims otherwise. The final shot of Jonathan riding off into the blazing sunlight of a desert was simply inserted, he says, because he fell in love with the location whilst scouting landscapes for a future documentary.Murnau's Dracula film remains one of cinema's finest works, and is homaged several times by Herzog. Herzog's Count, though, isn't really after sex, blood, or even mourning over a kind of unrequited love. Instead, he's supremely tired and literally always wants to die. In short, he desires death because he sees constantly desiring desire as a slow death spiral. Murnau's film, of course, is almost the opposite; Murnau was gay and people tend to read his classic as being about sexual repression and a kind of carnality which clashes with "civilization" and "civilized" behaviour. One film is thus about suppression, the other about anhedonia (the tyranny of uninhibitedness and expression); Herzog's Count is a Freudian monster, consumed by his own drive to consume and a victim of his very own desires. 8/10 ? Creepy, and Kinski is excellent, but the Dracula tale is just so VERY familiar. Worth two viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Nosferatu the Vampyre" is an incredibly fun and enjoyable Gothic vampire effort.**SPOILERS**Arriving for work, Jonathan Harker, (Bruno Ganz) learns that he is to go to Transylvania for an important assignment, which upsets Lucy Harker, (Isabelle Adjani) his wife. Finally arriving in the countryside, he learns the locals fear the place as legends state a deadly creature, which they've named Nosferatu, haunts the area, which he writes off as mere superstition but makes it to Castle Dracula anyway. When Count Dracula, (Klaus Kinski) appears to sign his deeds that were being delivered, he takes him prisoner in his castle and goes to England, starting up a relationship with her during the night against her knowledge. When it's apparent that a vampire is the cause of the plague, vampire hunter Dr. Van Helsing, (Walter Ladengast) is called in, who confirms the news and sets out to hunt down the vampire and kill all those who have become like it.The Good News: When this one tries, it does have some good parts. The cinematography here is also rather nice, getting some nice shots as the slow-motion bat used in the nightmare scenes, the lush hillsides of the peasant villagers and the countryside journey as a whole is really great. Even the opening shots of the mummified corpses in various states of rot-and-decay look really great, setting an eerie mood that the film really captures well. There's also the film's rather fun and enjoyable Gothic atmosphere that creeps in, from the rocky passageway to Dracula's castle that runs alongside a bubbling river, the nighttime attack on the ship through the slow-motion photography and the unbelievable sequence where the vampire pulls his coffin out of the ship and takes it into a foggy cemetery during the dead of night manages to be one of the film's best scenes overall. It manages to get better, as the scenes in the decaying castle at the beginning, the nighttime scenes in the bedroom and the fight with Van Helsing at the end are also really great and get a lot of good about them. Even a minor throwaway scene as the funeral scene looks rather great with the coffins emerging from the church in four different pathways, all done at a huge angle to see just outlines of the coffins moving in the line, which is a great look and is done with a great feel to it. The look of the vampire in here is really great, with the balding head, dead eyes, pale skin and huge fangs perfectly suited to open up large wounds on the body, which make for an imposing monster to face, yet when there's also the rather large clawed hands and huge black cape, it becomes even better and scarier. The scenes of it running loose around the town, with the oddly shaped and quite menacing silhouette plastered across the building-face, leaves a great impression and make the film that much more fun. The last good part here is the film's rather fun and frenetic last half, which is the search around London for the vampire, the last great confrontation in the bedroom and it's all-encompassing wrap-around, which includes the only gore in the film, a really great entry and it's all a great way to end the film. These here are all that work for the film.The Bad News: This one didn't have many flaws but there was a couple. Frankly, one of the biggest problems here is the film's pacing. This takes forever to get going, mainly due to several scenes either not being necessary or just going on too long. The meeting on the beach goes too long to get it's important point across, the hilarity between the crew in the library manages to make a one-note joke last a lot longer than it should, and the entire sequence with the villagers in the mountains was completely unneeded. Though it spills the legend of the titular creature and their understandable fear of him, there's little reason for it to be here since it really could've come from another scene, maybe replacing the joking in the library. What these mainly do is simply just extend the film out, making it much longer than it should be. It has no need to be nearly two hours long, and the trimming of these would've helped that along. There's also a feeling, with all the fancy camera-tricks and photography that this one plays more as a technical display rather than an all-out horror film, and that's something to get over. The last flaw is that there's very little vampire action, relegating mostly to the end it cuts down on the attempted blood and gore. This one should've had a little more involved in that area, but what's here isn't all that terrible, it just needed a little more. All-told, these aren't enough to really knock it down from what good it features.The Final Verdict: A great Gothic exercise in an era when they don't do it any more, which has some minor flaws going for it to lower it slightly. This one's a big plus for fans of the slow-burning Gothic tales of the 60s or those into the creative side of things, otherwise seek caution with it.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Language</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever parody, full of dark humor; hides its true nature well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Werner Herzog is one of those self-proclaimed cinematic geniuses who writes, produces, directs, takes the tickets ... all that. Some years ago he undertook to remake the 1922 silent classic, "Nosferatu". The result is the 1979 flick, "Nosferatu the Vampyre". The last word isn't exactly a misspelling: they often spelled it that way in the Victorian and Edwardian eras. Nowadays it's an affectation, and this little anachronism ought to give us a clue as to the film's (apparent) true intent. This isn't so much a remake as a parody ... it's not "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" (alas), but rather an almost-humorless Teutonic parody. Once you get past the deliberate dead-panning, it's hilarious.Now, I have no proof of this, other than the evidence (which, of course, is evidence in court). One correspondent assures me that Werner Herzog hasn't got a "parody" bone in his body and that his comments on the DVD version of the film don't begin to speculate about the merest suspicion of a contemplation of the containing of even a hint of such a thing. Well, how do you make a good dead-pan parody if you then admit it? But consider the evidence. Although this is a remake of the original Nosferatu, some things have been done to bring it closer to the traditional "Dracula" story -- primarily the introduction of Dr. Van Helsing. There's a big clue -- in this film Van Helsing absolutely doesn't believe in vampires until the very last few minutes. And then he takes it into his head to drive a stake into Dracula, who has already been killed by sunlight. The overkill is a nice parody touch.The relationships between the basic characters has changed. Lucy is Mrs. Harker, and Harker works for Renfield. The last, although he apparently has never laid eyes on Dracula, is (also apparently) under his spell -- he giggles at lot for no good reason: a manic Dr. Hibbert. In fact, the only character in the film who believes (a) in vampires and (b) that Dracula is one is Lucy (who, in the original story, has no such opinions). Van Helsing is a local doctor who has decided that local victims of the vampire have died of plague. It's true that the ship that brought Dracula also brought a bunch of rats ... scads and slathers of white (!!) rats, or perhaps oversize lab mice. Whenever they appear, they are shown in exaggerated piles and clumps, like hundreds of malformed puppies.Parody here is often in the little details. Dracula's chiming clock, with a prominent skull on top and a skeleton going in and out doors below, is a great bit of guignol, but wonderfully out of place otherwise. And of course the music. Most of it is by Popul Vuh (often oddly folksy but usually appropriately creepy), but some is by Wagner -- specifically a few moments from the prelude to Rheingold. It's music related to the Rhein and the creation of the world. The music appears in 2 scenes, for both of which it is wholly inappropriate due both to the general character of the music and to its meaning in the Wagnerian universe. The scenes are: Harker travelling through a mountain pass to Dracula's castle and Dracula moving his coffins off-ship to his new home. Such use of this music is -- as Hertzog would well know -- laughable.There is also the question of black-suited, black-hatted morticians/pallbearers. There seems to be quite a population of these people in Wismar (a canal-laced ancient city in Mecklenburg, near the Baltic Sea). At one point a whole parade of them bring out the coffins of the dead. It appears that everyone in Wismar is dying except these macabre individuals. Their march-with-coffins is a masterpiece of dark humor. Remembering it still drives me to laughter.Finally, there is Klaus Kinsky's performance of Dracula. Critics have minced no words about how wonderful it is, how creepy, how appropriate. It seems to me that Kinsky isn't so much creepy as somnolent, as if he had a really bad case of weltschmerz. A vampire is one of the great powers of the supernatural world: a shape-shifter, preternaturally strong, a powerful mesmeriser. Kinsky seems more mesmerized. As a vampire he is diffident and shy, almost apologetic about being what he is. How brilliant! This isn't playing to type but playing against it. And that, friends, is parody. Or, to quote Warner Brothers, "Now, THAT'S comedy!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is one different movie.it's Werner Herzog's version of the Dracula story.(it is in English)it's a low budget affair to be sure,but that doesn't detract from it's quality as a film.you won't find any over the top blood and guts in this one,and the acting is very subdued,but not in a bad way.the movie itself is very haunting and creepy.i like how the light and shadows were utilized.Klaus Kinski portrays Dracula and brings an element of sympathy to the character,but also makes him more tragic.Dracula is not depicted as a suave seducer of women in this film.quite the opposite.he is actually just this side of hideous and repulsive.the makeup dept did a great job with this character.Isabelle Adjani portrays Lucy Harker,object of the count's desire,and new wife of Jonathon(Bruno Ganz).Adjani is very effective in her role as the haunting beauty best by nightmares and a sense of dread.Bruno Ganz as Jonathon is also well portrayed,but the movie is really more a tragic love story(although twisted) between Lucy and the count.the character of Dr. Van Helsing is really a minor character here.the character of Renfield played by Roland Topor,steals the show with his scenes,and not always in a good way.the character is equal parts compelling and annoying.that maniacal laugh wears thin sometimes,but Topor really seems gleeful in the role.before i forget,i must mention the opening sequence,which is extraordinarily haunting and sombre,and very effective.later movies would try to copy that sequence but to a much less effective degree.the movie is filled with dread and melancholy and i think is much more accurate and faithful to the novel by Bram Stoker.the only thing i didn't like about this movie is that the music sometimes doesn't seem to fit.sometimes it's almost whimsical,when i don't think it should be.also if you are expecting a fast paced movie,you will be disappointed with this one.it can be very slow at times.otherwise,it's a pretty decent adaptation.is it the definitive version?possibly.for me,"Nosferatu:The Vampyre" is a 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>magnificent on atmosphere and photography/visuals, so-so on some of the acting and horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Werner Herzog's Nosferatu is one of the damnedest kinds of vampire movies I've ever seen. It may or may not be as faithful to the Bram Stoker novel of Dracula as the other films in its vein (never read the book), but what Herzog is interested in may not be what is shared by more modern vampire-film fans. This is actually a vampire film that does earn its PG rating; it's not violent at all, and its lack of violence and bloodletting allows for other factors that wouldn't be seen on Buffy the Vampire Slayer or, of course, Blade. It almost tries to be a 'thinking man's' vampire movie, where themes of decimation, the Gothic, and the dreadful are amplified by Herzog and his DP Jrg Schmidt-Reitwein's use of locales and the objects in them. While I have not seen the bulk of Herzog's more famous films, this may be one of his best in just purely visual, creepily atmospheric terms. It combines some elements of early German expressionism, the kind that crawls up your skin and is even more spooky than anything in any modern horror effort (and a small tip of the hat to Murnau's landmark 1922 effort), and at the same time incorporating some documentary-style elements (many hand-held scenes).But the problems of the film, at least from my perspective, almost compete with the film's attributes. Being that this Nosferatu, unlike Murnau's film, is in sound and color and with better resources and locations, and suffers from a few qualities that could have been given better attention by Herzog and his people. The acting, for example, is a mixed bag of goods and not so goods. Kinski, to be sure, is one of the major reasons to see the film, as his Count Dracula carries an extra weight of malaise, terror, and (due to Kinski himself) a further dark tragedy to his very existence. Any moment he was on screen I was hooked into what he, the nutty actor he is, was doing. Bruno Ganz as the other important character, Jonathan Harker, was good as well in what was required of him. But the part of Lucy is played by Isabelle Adjani in a way that brings the film down sometimes. Maybe in part it was due to watching her perform in English instead of the German dub, but aside from her beautiful physical presence, which isn't enough on its own, her emotional and reactionary read-out was pretty bad. And other supporting players who tackle regulars like Renfield and (possibly under-used) Van Helsing only have little moments in lackluster turns.And there's even something almost conflicting with the atmosphere itself that waxed and waned with it working or not. Despite Herzog capturing some effective, strange but very palatable images, chiefly the countless, domineering rats that come about through Nosferatu's very presence, changing an entire city into a feeble and plague-a-plenty place, there's something 'off' sometimes. And it might be more in due to the music, by Popol Vuh, who have also created music for other Herzog films. The themes that are used work the first time around, but they are repeated without the same effect, or of a lesser kind, than before; such a deliberate, near awe-inspiring amount of visuals need the right musical touches, and it's just 50/50 in what works and what doesn't. In the end, what Herzog, his actors, and crew provides with this take on the vampire legend is definitely not one to dismiss, as it has some chilling qualities and a couple of shocking touches. On its own its never boring even in its slowest moments, and amounts to being a good example of what can be done with the most notorious in the sub-genre. But it goes without saying that it misses the mark of being as daring and audacious as Murnau's silent was. A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Klaus Kinski the Vampire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fourth in the famous series of Kinski/Herzog collaboration, "Nosferatu" is a remake of Murnau's 1922 eponymous silent classic. Director Herzog tells the familiar Dracula story with added German sense of doom and focuses on the plight of the vampire, Count Orlok (Kinski).This is neither as technologically groundbreaking nor as frightening as the original, but then again, that was never the issue. Herzog gives us the most astonishing cinematography of his entire filmography (dreamy washed out colors and pitch-black shadows), and tells the tale of Nosferatu as a tragedy rather than a horror film. In this, his version is particularly successful, thanks to an ethereal quality and a brooding atmosphere. It is also (one more) thanks to an unusual yet devastating performance by his lead actor. While Bruno Ganz brings more depth to Jonathan Harker than was ever given to that character on the screen, Klaus Kinski makes the film essential viewing. His sad, anguished Orlok is at once scary and pitiful. Never before or since has a vampire evoked such sympathy despite many terrible actions.Determined not to let Kinski walk away with the entire film, Herzog throws all his film-making potential into the creation of a world and its atmosphere. This works to stunning effect. Painterly compositions render the horrific ambiguously beautiful (beyond any shot featuring Kinski, a banquet overrun by rats burns itself into your memory). This is the most measured, most delicate of the duo's outings, the delicate aria that precedes the great fanfare of Fitzcarraldo and the thunderous bang that is Cobra Verde. The best remake ever filmed and one of the most agonizingly beautiful pictures in existence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" Unlike any Dracula film ever made".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A German film produced by German movie producers; about Jonathon Harker (Bruno Ganz) and his wife Lucy Harker (Isabelle Adjani) who live together in Wismar, Germany. Soon, Jonathon had to go on a trip to Transylvania to allow Count Dracula (Klaus Kinski) to sign a contract because, he was taking a house back in Wismar which was close to the Harkers when Renfield (Roland Topor)informed him.When Jonathon got to Transylvania, he stopped at a gypsy camp and he was given a cross and a book about " Nosferatu: The Vampire". The next morning, Jonathon left for the castle which was over the icy mountains. The high and low angles of the mountains, waterfalls and lakes were spectacular!And soon, Jon got to the castle of Count Dracula which was close to the Black Sea and Jon was welcomed in. Dracula in this film looked like Barlow in "Salem's Lot", he was very intimidating and his hands looked like bird's claws! Whereas the castle had an interesting anterior which was painted white, it had brown doors and dark brown furniture. Very lovely.And that insane clock which had a little person which came out of the skull and whacked the bell from inside the skull and followed by the skeleton underneath which switched caskets. TOTALLY INSANE!!! The night after, Dracula attacked Jon and back home; Lucy began to sleep walk and she went outside and one of the people who were looking after her brought her back in, and that was Mina (Martje Grohmann). And later, while Lucy was resting in her bed; she started to get all worried and then she shouted " JONATHON!" Dracula heard Lucy's scream from so far away! Amazing.When morning came, Jon scoured about the castle, he went outside into a small room and he saw a casket made of stone; and when he opened it, he saw Dracula inside. Now Jon knows that Dracula is a vampire. Later on in the evening, Jon saw Dracula get into a casket which was on a cart and took off to Varner and then to Wismar. Jon knew that his wife was now in danger.A few days later, the ship came into Wismar, the sailor was tied to the wheel and there were rats everywhere! Big, white ones. On the following day, Jon returned home looking rather pale and he didn't know who his wife was.He also had amnesia and the light bothered him. And when evening came, Drac discovered where the couple lived and he went into Lucy's room while she was doing her hair, she only noticed a shadow; no reflection. She freaked alright.Next morning, four caskets were seen being taken down the road and Renfield escaped from the sanatorium. Renfield went to Dracula and he told to go north of Riga and the rats would follow him. Soon, millions of caskets were taken down to the outside of the town hall. Kiff bird's eye shot.On the following day, there were tons of caskets, animals were running free in the streets, people were dancing about, furniture was seen and there were millions of rats everywhere. THE RATS WERE INFESTING THE PLACE!!! The Council hall dissolved, the Mayor was dead and so were the cops!!! There were lots of people having fun because, they were trying to make the plague not worry them. And Lucy was told to come and see what happened to her friend Schrader (Carsten Bodinus). She was found lying in the study in her household with two holes on the side of her neck. Dracula certainly took a big suck out of her.And finally that evening, Dracula came to attack Lucy and he bit her but he didn't bite Jon because, he was protected with vamp ban. And when morning came, Lucy looked very pale and Dracula went and looked out the window, he saw the sunlight and died. You should've seen it! People were waiting outside, Dr. Von Helsing (Walter Ladengast) broke in, found Lucy lying on her bed and Drucula on the floor. As quick as a flash, he got a hammer and a stake and killed Dracula. And now, everything is over except for one problem, Jonathon has become the new Count Dracula! Overall, the music in this film isn't at all outdated, it sure did SPOOK me out, those decaying bodies which were seen in the beginning sure looked gruesomely dried out! And , the movie was a very good vampire film and it was SO unlike any Dracula film and it showed all the detail of Wismar in the 17th century! STUNNING! WELL DONE, WERNER HERZOG!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nosferatu the Vampyre is an extremely strange movie experience. It's weirdly haunting and hysterically funny at the same time. I get exactly the same vibe from every Dario Argento film I have seen, so maybe it's a feature common to European horror films. I just cannot take the vampire seriously. I daresay if I met him in real life I would soil my underpants but onscreen he is just a feeble old man and not remotely scary. The halting delivery of dialogue in the English Language version, and the tuneless violin playing by the strange boy in the castle (a scene missing from the English Language version) also give the impression that this is a shabby, shabby film. Having said that though, I find it very enjoyable. It does veer wildly from hamfest to surreal dreaminess, and it shouldn't work, but it somehow gets away with it. Worth watching, if only out of curiosity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This version of the Dracula novel by Bram Stoker changes the focus and the story slightly but keeps the basic ingredients (Jonathan goes to visit Count Dracula's ruined castle, finds his host pretty weird, and finds that the commission to find the Count a house will have an impact on all the Harker family and associates).The music on the soundtrack is brilliant and really effective, and there are some stunning visuals concerning bats, rats, death heads, and lots of shadows. In the role of Dracula, Klaus Kinski is superb, giving the malevolent Count a terrifying power but at the same time, making you almost feel sorry for him. Memories of the silent version are evoked by the long nails and the spooky silhouettes.Sadly the others in the cast don't quite match, particularly Isabelle Adjani who is especially poor, when Lucy really needs a bit more characterisation and skill than Adjani possesses. However, Werner Herzog creates atmosphere and tension within the film that outshines any casting doubts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Werner Herzog movies are strange. They have a dreamlike quality that I find unsettling. I'm never quite sure if I like them but they are unique and intriguing. They are also sometimes insufferable. Nosferatu is no exception. The film is so slow and atmospheric that it's easy to lose interest. Sometimes the stillness is haunting but most times it felt like a different movie was being randomly inserted into the one I was watching.The music is terrible and the acting by Isabelle Adjani isn't much better. (Though Goth lovers will be smitten by her ghostly pallor, which she inexplicably has way before the vampire is anywhere near her.) Most of the dialogue in the English language version is spoken in a halting and hesitating way without inflection as if the actors don't understand the lines they are saying. But Bruno Ganz makes a suitable Jonathan Harker. Those sad eyes perfectly reflect a character that we know is doomed.Klaus Kinski has one of the strangest faces ever and here he is transformed into a rodent-like vampire in the Max Schrek tradition. He is skeletal, drained and weary. His performance conveys pity more than horror. His performance is probably the best of the bunch but I'll confess that his final death throw scene had me giggling.The opening scene with the mummies is truly horrifying but has nothing to do with the film. Some of the best scenes are homages to the silent classic and the extended plague scenes in the town square are kind of cool. However, the ending seemed tacked on and the scene where they discuss how to arrest Van Helsing was completely ridiculous. Ultimately, this film cannot really be judged against other Dracula films because it's not really about Bram Stoker's story as much as it is about Herzog's artistic vision.</fullReview>

The answer to that question would determine its rating.If it's trying to be a visual showcase, it's wonderful.If a symbolic entry, it's overdone ... somewhat like trying to use a sledgehammer to swat a fly. If a retelling of the Dracula legend, it completely misses. Read the book, watch the film, there's nothing in common other than a few names.If purely a remake of the silent entry, nice try, but no cigar. The original actually benefitted from the refusal of the Stoker estate to use the Dracula story. The changes made to prevent copyright enfringement actually made it the masterpiece that it became;.Because of this uncertain purpose of the film, you will either love it or fall asleep - and either way you're right.I would recommend seeing the film - if only to determine your own response to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kinski turns Ganz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht" is a movie over 35 years old written and directed by German filmmaking legend Werner Herzog. This is his proof that he can also succeed with remake as this is obviously very heavily based on Murnau's silent film classic from 1922. You could basically split Herzog's movie into three parts. The first third belongs to Bruno Ganz, the second to Klaus Kinski and the third to Isabelle Adjani. This last segment is probably also why she agreed to star in the movie as her character was a bit of a nothing role until then and she already was an Academy Award nominee at that point.This film is also the only one that had Ganz and Herzog work together. So far, I shall say. It would be amazing to see them reunite at some point. Of course, Herzog worked so many times with Kinski in his career and they brought up the best in one another, especially Herzog in Kinski. The latter got lots of awards recognition for his work here and it's easy to see why. He basically redefined the modern vampire in this movie. Man was he scary. Of course, a lot of it also had to do with the excellent makeup, but let's not look down on Kinski's mesmerizing performance here. I can't deny that Ganz looked a bit pale beside him (no pun intended!) Still I love the guy and it's nice to see him in some of his earlier roles long before his career-defining performance as Adolf Hitler. Kinski made an Italian sequel to this one, almost 10 years later. I have not seen that one, but looking at the rating and the absence of Herzog, Adjani and Ganz, I am not too eager to see it, even if I like Pleasence and Plummer.Back to this one here, it's a pretty good film. I can't say that it is among my very favorite Werner Herzog films, but all in all it is 107 minutes certainly worth a watch, especially for people with an interest in older German movies or films about vampires. There actually have been tons of them in the past already, featured so frequently in film, and this is easily among the better efforts about this subject.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I start, I must say I thoroughly enjoyed this film and was happy to watch it to the end. So let's get the bad stuff out of the way before I tell u why I recommend watching this film at least once in your life? The aspect that I found the most surprisingly disappointing is the sound. Here I am only commenting on the English version of the film and maybe the German version is much better. The sound just does not flow and this partly because the ADR and Foley jar as the acoustics never match what we see on screen. The dialogue always sounds like it was recorded in a sound proof booth and never on location. The sound track has poorly executed fade outs and jump cuts. The quality and insistent "hiss" are difficult to forgive, even for 1979. Think 1960s Spaghetti Western recorded on VHS. And yet, just like the Spag Westerns there are some great sound moments ? much of the music is very atmospheric and I felt it actively advances the audiences understanding of what is being shown on the screen. It just needs a major remixing to flow.The quality of the acting (with the exception of Klaus Kinski) was fairly mechanical. Maybe I was missing the point, but the way the reacted to the various events tended to be artificially late and over theatrical. Was this supposed to be reminiscent of the silent era or was it just poor ? maybe you should decide for yourself. The English dialogue they had to work with was not well written and not well delivered. English would not have been the actor's mother tongue so maybe it works much better in the German version. And yet? and yet, all this odd acting ? I cannot say it actually detracted as much as it should. In fact I found it gave the whole thing a strange atmosphere which may have even matched the mood of the film.There visual side of the film is better, if occasionally inconsistent. Always visually interesting and unconventionally shot, it never loses interest. The historical anachronisms are so grating that I chose to consider them as part of the surreal texture of the film.The way the film is edited did not really impress me. It gave me the impression of being assembled rather than cleverly edited. I generally like a occasional lingering shot of a beautifully / cleverly framed subject that give me time to ponder what the director is trying to communicate, but some shots lingered long, long, long after they had ceased to advance the plot or visually stimulate. For example, there is a shot of a wall where actors had exited stage left several seconds ago and a panning shot of a stage coach lasting 40 odd seconds before cutting to two more ponderous shot of the stage coach's stately procession. OK, I admit, it was a nice castle wall and beautifully framed stage coach set against stunning backgrounds? And yet despite what sounds like condemning criticisms, I did find the film compelling. I am not going to criticise the plot as although it is minimal, it is sufficient. Dracula films frequently avoid over elaborate plots as they don't seem to need to tell a long story to take us on a thrilling journey to the world of vampires. Despite the inconsistent editing, poor sound and "unusual" acting styles, for me it really did have a unique and compelling atmosphere.Then there is Klaus Kinski. Dracula has been played by countless actors, but I think Klaus Kinski really succeeded in getting as close as possible to showing us something truly original while still being recognisably Dracula. This is a really creepy Dracula and while I found the persona revolting I did catch myself feeling some sympathy. Klaus played Dracula more like an instinctive creature than an evil human and so it is very impressive I could still identify with this ghastly wretch. There was never even the remotest chance of someone stealing the scene while Klaus is in shot. Maybe the so-so acting of the supporting cast serves the film well in making Klaus' brilliance all the more impressive?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The one that bit the cow.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will be honest. When I first began this film, upon seeing the first ten minutes, I was frightened. Not because there was anything to be frightened about, but because of the low-grade production value that was very clear. The cheap sets, the cheesy actors with horrible English dubbing, coupled with a soundtrack that could easily raise the dead, I was ready to watch this film crash and burn. Oddly, this only happened within the first ten minutes, once Harker gets to Dracula's castle, we are handed huge portions of the meat and potatoes of this film. Nosferatu transforms right in front of your eyes from a cheesy horror flick to a mind-bending horror classic that deserves the cult following it has obtained. This was one of those films that you should sit and enjoy throughout the entire film, and do not judge it on just the first few minutes. Get into the story, and I think you will be impressed.There were two parts that stuck out the most in my mind. These were two scenes that proved to me that I was in fact witnessing cinema in its rawest form. The first is when Dracula is running down the streets of Virna seemingly random, but imaginatively pure. He is searching for the woman he dreams about, Lucy Harker. He has the expression of a kid in a candy store for the very first time. This is classic avant-garde film-making at its best. You could tell that money was tight for this production, but somehow the masterful eye of director Werner Herzog kept it all together. His scenes were, to say the least, brilliant. There were some very starchy moments, but all together he kept a very vivacious spirit alive in this film. Again, it just took about ten minutes to get into the full package of Nosferatu. The second favorite scene of mine is the stoic Last Supper scene that confused me at first, but after finishing the film made much more sense. The plague was infesting this little town, and the citizens knew they were going to die ? immorality was a desire of only one person, Dracula, so why not celebrate in the best way possible. I know there are other ways to see this scene, but I just saw a hopeless class of people living life for the possible last time. It was visionary and beautiful all at the same time.While these scenes really helped create the aura of the film, it was purely the work of the actors that kept my mind focused on the screen. My favorite of all the characters presented was Roland Topor's portrayal of Renfield. His sinister, yet uncontrolled, laughter spooked me. His face was goofy, and believable. He embodied the sense of insanity and used it well for his character. Second, was Kinski as Dracula. Where did they find this guy? I do not believe that vanity was anywhere included in his vision of Dracula.He was scary, curious, and insatiable all at the same time. His portrayal of Dracula beats Gary Oldman any day (I have not seen the 1922 version with Shreck ? so I stand to what I say ? for now). Overall, everyone from Lucy Harker to a very unused Van Helsing was superb and really carried this film off the ground.The only disappointing aspect of this film was the DVD. Normally, I can look past horrible reproductions of film as they gradually make it to digital format, but this was uncalled for. Here we have a beautiful film with some very good acting and direction, and all we have is a Chapters menu and Start Film. I was sad to see this. I wanted some more history on this film and to know more about these actors. I was a first time viewer that desired more knowledge. Secondly, the sound mixing was off. Perhaps it was off the entire film, but the actors at times seemed to be saying one thing with their lips, and out came something completely different from their voices. It was a very strange distraction that unfocused me from this film.Overall, with the recent popularity of the Hollywood lack-luster Van Helsing, it was sheer enjoyment to go back to the classics and see where Van Helsing found his start. This was a beautiful film that should be viewed by everyone, but waited until another version is released on DVD. This just didn't make the grade for me.Grade: **** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth seeing for surreal imagery, but wouldn't scare your grandma</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was in large part a disappointment, at least for me. I love the horror genre and vampire movies in particular, and thought maybe this was a gem that I'd overlooked and would really enjoy. I was wrong. Kinski is so so as Nosferatu, and although I admired the cinematography and the surreal sorta beauty of a lot of the scenes, it seemed like a confused film overall. A lot of the dialogue was lame, and while it obviously aims to be somewhat satiric, it really isn't funny at all, just bland. I don't understand why directors even bothering trying to blend comedy with horror; they just don't go together, and nine times out of ten when it is attempted the result is wasted energy and a stupid, boring movie. Which isn't to say that "Nosferatu" doesn't have it's merits;it's worth seeing just for the surreal imagery alone. Don't expect to be scared though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rats, Rats, and Mooore Rats... :=8/</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, Director Werner Herzog's "Nosferatu" has mooore rats than this cow has ever seen, possibly even mooore rats than "Willard". Herzog("Fitzcaraldo", "Aguirre: the Wrath of God"), is known for making pretty, artsy Euro-flicks, mainly with his long-time pal Klaus Kinski, the John Carradine of German film. Kinski("Fitzcaraldo", "The Blue Hand", "Crawlspace") enjoyed a career which saw him grace no only Herzog's artsy Euro-flicks, but also many stinky American schlockers. Like Carradine, he was a fine actor who cud not turn down a role, any role. This time, he plays Count Dracula - yep the Big Toothy Guy himself. But Herzog's film is mooore a remake of the Max Schrenk silent 20's masterpiece "Nosferatu", than of the traditional Hollywood Dracula films(ie: Bela Lugosi). And, Kinski plays the Count as moore of a tragic figure, someone who longs for the chance to live and love and snuggle next to the serenely beautiful Isabelle Adjani("Camille Claudel", "Diabolique", "Queen Margot"). This is all very well for those touchy-feely Anne Rice weepy-hero vampire-lovers out there, but moost true horror fans have found "Nosferatu" to be a rather weak entry into the genre. Like many Herzog films, "Nosferatu" is nice to look at, with scenes set in lovely cobblestoned streets and regal castles. But as a horror film, "Nosferatu" simply cannot bring about enough suspense to deliver any true thrills. Like Coppola's disappointing 1992 "Dracula", this film is moore about setting, mood, and visual splendor than actual horror. Those with little patience will get bored quickly, as "Nosferatu" has neither gore, nudity, nor violence to get their cowbells shaking. Which is not a bad thing, of course. Anyone who finds rats creepy will get mooore than their share of the wiggins, as viewers get to watch thousands of their furry friends crawl all over the sets. But even the rats seem curiously antiseptic, and seem of the clean, cute laboratory-variety. It should be noted that Roland Topor(writer of "Fantastic Planet") plays a particularly giggly &amp; hiccuppy Renfield. The MooCow says in the right circumstances, "Nosferatu" makes for an interesting diversion into anudder view of the vampire-genre, but if yer looking for real horror, the kind to curdle the milk in yer udders, then you gotta take the herd someplace else. :=8)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nosferatu was a very slow moving movie. It took almost one third of the movie to get to the vampire. The cuts were around thirty seconds between each one. The movie overall was too slow moving for modern viewers who expect a cut every seven seconds. Other than the fact that it was slow, I thought that it was an okay movie. The plot was good, even though it took too long to get started.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since I missed seeing Herzog's Nosferatu in college, I have been on a crusade to see this film, and it has eluded me for years, my expectations seemed to increase. Even the art film theatre managers would praise it but then go on to say that no decent prints fit for screening existed any longer. I would often return to the Max Screck version as a consolation, and expected that someday I would get to see a superior vampire film with all the best of the silent version plus more quality and style! Finally, Nosferatu appears in the video stores, apparently for the first time. Oh, rapture! I bought both the English and German versions (it was explained to me long ago that this film is somewhat unique in that each scene was filmed twice, with the actors reciting their lines in the two languages, no overdubs here). I got out the big bowl of popcorn and hunkered down to enjoy. WELL....even Christmas never seems to live up to the expectations. I COULD see the obsessive Herzog treatment everywhere, I COULD see the unusual lack of actor's ego in Kinski's vampire (no mugging for the camera, no hint of the actor enjoying the role). I COULD see the visual beauty in every scene. But, it was, well, boring. Only the early scenes, when the vampire is still in his castle, did I sense the extreme loneliness and sadness of the character, something that I believe is unique to this film. He's not happy to be a bloodsucker or immortal, and it shows here. The other characters are uniformly wooden and uninteresting. My opinion now is that the first half of the film is quite good, based solely on Kinski's efforts, and the second half could be missed. I'm keeping the German version and the English is getting donated to the public library. Two stars out of 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . thinking that the grass is greener on the other side of the grave, in this wildly over-rated "talkie" version of NOSFERATU. Just as Dorothy Gale of Kansas (who only had to click her heels together three times to go back home) held her fondest wish within easy reach, it turns out that all the Count's constant bellyaching about "fates worse than Death" has been very simply fixable for him all along; it just involves a small splash of sunlight followed by six seconds of gentle convulsions. This movie seems to be a lazy allegory on the part of writer\producer\director Werner Herzog for the coming storm of Thatcher-Merkel-Reaganomics and their bogus theories of non-existent "trickle downs." Count D. represents the One Percenters, who keep sucking the life-lines of everyone else, but still are not content. Like Dracula, these fat cats, fat bats, and fat rats (all featured in NOSFERATU) know that they are cursed for all Eternity. Therefore, their sole reason to be is to suck up as close to 100% of this world's life and money as inhumanly possible, to avenge themselves against Nature's Better Angels. Herzog's stark Realism leaves the Forces of Evil (represented by the seduced survivor, Jonathan) triumphant.</fullReview>

I mean, not the sort of dude that's especially frightening, or could even win in a fight, if it came right down to it. Max Schreck's Nosferatu absoultely wipes the floor with Kinski's. I mean, realistically, of course, no one could (or really should try to) recreate verbatim the frightening countenance of Schreck, but Kinski, in a few vital scenes in this film (Nos at the window, Nos in the doorway, but the end scene with Nina is actually pretty good). He just doesn't do it for me, I guess. As for the film itself, it does a good job of recreating all the events of the original (the original being around 60 minutes, this version is about 140 with added little extras, and more things from the original are treated in-depth), even to the point of superboredom (for some people), but it was okay. I heard Kinski cleans up his act in the sequel to this one, not so emo-vamp the second time around. I'd sure hope so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the real standout is the cinematography...but it's painfully slow.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to heap strong praise on the cinematographer in his ability to make a color film that looks almost black and white. These muted colors and use of dull blues and lots of grays REALLY enhance the film and give it a beautiful moodiness and creepiness. This is by far the best aspect of the movie.As for the acting and writing, I was less enthusiastic. In addition to the stark lighting and cinematography, the acting itself was VERY stark and way too subdued. The moody scenery was good--the moodiness of the acting was NOT. While the movie should not have been high energy, at times it felt like it had almost none and tended to bore me from time to time. With a SMALL does of adrenaline, it would have been a lot better. The slowness of the film just seemed too much and the film would have improved by just speeding up the filming, as there are just too many long and deliberate scenes. Some see this as artistry--I see it as just too over-indulgent.Although very dated, I still think the original is the better movie of the two. Unlike NOSFERATU (1979), it was unique and not just some come lately remake. And, and many ways, the original silent version is more haunting and terrifying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No rats were harmed in the making of this clinker...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie offers viewers another opportunity to experience the Dracula myth. Unfortunately, like the vampires it portrays, "Nosferatu" has not aged well.First, there's the pace of the film. Though this was clearly conceived and executed as a highly commercial project, the movie seems to creep along at a languid rate. It wouldn't be fair to call it dull, but for a suspense/horror movie "Nosferatu" seems quite unengaging for long stretches of time. I found myself squirming with boredom, particularly during the sequence in which Nosferatu and his extended family go on their magical sea voyage from Transylvania to wherever it is in Holland they end up.Then there's the acting. At the top of the list, Klaus Kinski offers us a morose, pensive, yet blood-crazed Nosferatu. The actor moons about equipped with prosthetic ears, prosthetic fangs, lots of mascara and press-on claws trying to imbue the legend with emotional depth and unexpected flashes of humanity. Alas, Kinski's Herculean efforts to nuance one of the great villains of all literature fall well short of his ambitions, in my view. There's lots of heavy breathing and more than one ponderous reference to death being preferable to living century after century, plus there's an unexpectedly civilized tete a tete between Kinski and Bruno Ganz's wife, Isabelle Adjani. But it really doesn't amount to much in the end.... Kinski's portrayal here mostly lacks the intensity and spark for which he was so famous in other roles.Isabelle Adjani is significantly worse. She is beautiful, of course, but her portrayal of the devoted wife is stilted, tedious and cold. Adjani's moments of terror fall even flatter than her sweet little upper-crust hausfrau routine, and with her overacting they resemble nothing so much as a holdover from the worst excesses of the silent era. After all, just because this movie was modeled closely on the F.W. Murnau film of 1922 doesn't mean that the actors have to ape the mannerisms of Murnau's troupe.Bruno Ganz is reasonably competent, though the strange passivity with which he first receives Nosferatu's bizarre overtures is hard to believe. Still, he looks appealingly beefy in a cape and seems the best of the bunch in my opinion. Beyond Ganz, Adjani and Kinski there are various others whose contribution to the movie are negligible, including sundry country folk who were obviously nonactors, as betrayed by their determinedly wooden presence on screen.Really, when I consider the simple excellence of the original Bela Lugosi vehicle, I cannot fathom why so many film treatments of the Dracula myth have been made over the succeeding years. The story is timeless and fascinating, but with each retelling by a different cast and crew the grave of Dracula grows even deeper and colder. I'd sooner fall on a wooden stake than see this particular version ever again.</fullReview>

Here we have tremendous imagery of the Carpathian Mountains, but the movie moves extremely slow. No question, the haunting imagery is there, Kinski, the foreboding mountains, the Gothic castle, but it fails to maintain interest, because the story is so low-key. For comparison, I rate "Fitzcarraldo" 8.5, "Aguirre The Wrath Of God" 8.0, and "Where The Green Ants Dream" 6.0. Herzog's "Nosferatu" was a disappointing experience. 4.0. - MERK</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Herzog is a hero of sorts. His Peruvian river films are life-altering. His meditation on glass was a remarkable commitment that we can share. Here is a man whose ownopenness and commitment often translates to a voyage into visual intoxication for us.But his openness is a vulnerability as well. Strong forces can intervene, can enter the dialog and capture the cinematic blood of the enterprise. Almost always, we are able to prevent that evil from penetrating the second barrier: from the film to us. Herzog is more open than we are, and that's the appeal.Here is a case. Herzog was approached (just like Jonathan Harker) for a commercial endeavor with more money than he was used to. He thought it would be a simple transaction: he could work with the mood, could leverage the genre. Vast vistas, hundreds of small animals as out of control neurons in a mad mind. Female beauty as hypnotic magnetism. Obsession rooted in vision.Kinski.But this project coopts Herzog in just the same way we watch Harker. What happened was precisely what happened to Tarkovsky six years earlier on "Solaris." Like a million flies, small compromises for the public, mismatches of tone, demands of the genre, faithfulness to the word, inadequacies of German history, weakness of the impact (to us) of the plague all conspire to capture the soul of the film.Is this the only color Dracula with no redhead?Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

There are just some thing in the film that could have been left out, such as a scene where we look at an empty town for about 10 minutes and then a random pig walks across the screen and goes to the bathroom in front of us. Was that necessary? Did we need to see that? Also the movie consists of two scores of music. There is one classical piece and there is a song on the violin. Those two songs looped over and over again. Most of the time you sit there wishing it would end, and somehow the movie is able to spit out another scene. It is boring scene after boring scene after boring scene after boring scene. There is no entertainment in this film at all. I saw this movie with a group of friends at a German Culture institute, and everyone in the theater (not just us) felt the same way.

I am now ready to say that this movie is not good at all. The main reason why this movie fails for me is because it is just not credible all along. Many plot scenes are just ludicrous (like the one Renfield ask him to travel to a far and remote country in europe on the spot and he accepts without hesitation)or plain silly (like the one Dracula carries himself the coffins from the boat to his hideout or the one when Harker is in the gypsies camp and says he wants to go to Dracula's castle and everyone there stop speaking and look at him all at once). And what is that obsession with the rats? Apart from that the "dracula" in this movie seems just a fragile and ill person who couldn't scare even the smallest children. I don't want to go into detail with such a weak movie so to sum it up I would just say that the movie lacks credibility throughout, looks dated and just low quality.</fullReview>

I have never before seen Count Dracula spending his nights in an almost all white abode. What happened to a dark and dank castle? Jonathan Harker(Bruno Ganz)must take a trip to see Count Dracula, who is in the market to buy a new residence. Jonathan reluctantly leaves his lovely wife Lucy(Isabelle Adjani)and worries about her safety. If he sells a nearby old home to the Count, the commission on the sale would be enough to buy Lucy a new home. Against warnings Jonathan finds out why the towns people are afraid of his possible client.My favorite scene is where the Count quickly grabs and sucks the blood from Jonathan's cut hand. Quite puzzling is how pale Lucy is and that is before she ever sees Dracula. Oh well, the story is basicly a good one; it just seems a little long in the tooth. This is a must see for any dyed in the wool Dracula buff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What director can blatantly copy a classic film shot-for-shot, invert the meaning in a clumsy and haphazard manner, and be hailed a true artist? Werner Herzog.A "remake" is created when you re-shoot a story that's already been made into a film. An "homage" is created when you incorporate elements of an earlier work for the purpose of elevating it or praising it. A "fraudulent copy" is created when you mindlessly reproduce the work of someone else. If you review both the original Nosferatu and Herzog's version simultaneously, and compare the shots, you'll find Herzog's version fits into the last category, without question. I can find no other reason to justify this aesthetic decision besides sheer laziness on the part of the director.But it's not enough for Herzog just to steal. He attacks the original version of Nosferatu by inverting the meaning of the story in his version. He transforms the monster into a victim (a misunderstood homosexual) and the hero into a persecutor. Put simply, Herzog's film is an anti-film, designed to negate the original Nosferatu. It's obnoxious that an amateur like Herzog can even pretend to usurp a "classic." My opinion so far has actually been *generous* to Herzog; I've assumed up to this point that he was actually able to communicate his ideas in a coherent way. But this is not the case. Even with the parrot-like shot copying, the film, like many of his others, is for the most part blurry in meaning and jammed with unnecessary clutter.All in all, the film is completely absent of value. When I first saw it, I assumed that it was made by an amateur, or a film student, who simply happened to have access to a limitless budget. It was only later that I found out who the director actually was (and that he actually *was* an amateur who had access to limitless funds: German government funds). Herzog, you should be ashamed of yourself. Film history will dismiss you as a tasteless joke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a despicable experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, seeing this movie was a total waste of time!First of all, I should begin to say that I only wanted to see this movie because I am such a big admirer of Murnau's 1922 'Nosferatu'. It turns out that the 1979 version is nothing more than a compendium of bad acting, embarrassing scenes and shabby decors.Did you ever feel embarrassed when when watching a really cheesy movie? Well, you'll have plenty of time to if you decide to see this one. To be more exact, you'll have almost two hours at your disposal to feel bad for wasting your time watching this worthless piece of film waste.I cannot believe that something like this could ever be produced. I feel it is an insult to the great Murnau's work of art. OKey, I can understand that maybe Herzog attempted to make a spoken version of the story. Needless to say he failed miserably. I am so curious, how could anyone mark this movie with something more than a 2?!?! Is there someone else that feels the same about this?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Useless remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will never understand the need to remake classic films, even silent ones. If Hollywood needs to remake films, they should take a bad film like FRANKENSTEIN'S DAUGHTER and make something worthwhile out of it. I have heard it said Herzog tried to get a dreamlike quality into his remake. The only dreamlike quality I got was the urge to fall asleep...and I was wide awake when I went to see it in the theatre. There is no pacing to the film, and the fact that a sequence showing a boat wander into the harbor lasted a full 6 minutes shows the film needed a good job of editing! NOSFERATU was a waste of film that should have been used to create something more worthwhile. If you want to see a credible attempt to make a superior version of DRACULA may I recommend the Philip Saville directed-Gerald Savory-scripted BBC version of COUNT DRACULA starring Louis Jourdan which was shown on PBS in the US, and not the edited version. Now there was someone who understood Stroker's DRACULA. It has a few flaws (shot on tape instead of film and Jourdan was not the best choice to play Dracula...I would have preferred Max Von Sydow made up to look like Stoker's description of the Count), but was the best attempt I have seen yet to do the book justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pound a stake through the heart of this miserable, slow film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is very difficult trying to decide if I have ever seen a more miserable film than this. Certainly "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" and Madonna's "Evita" would be contenders for the honor, but it is a tight competition.Last night, I went into Washington, D.C. to the German Goethe-Institut to view this film in its original form, with English subtitles. To say that it was terrible would be a vast understatement. How so many of you rate this film so highly? Haven't you ever seen any quality films? The shots are _too_ long, the acting is wooden, the plot could be conveyed in nearly full detail in a paragraph or two, and the editing... there didn't seem to be any editing. I was given the impression that they took all of their raw footage and spliced it together without concern.Oh, and don't get me started on the subtitles. There were only subtitles for about 50% of the words spoken. There would be entire 5 minute scenes without subtitles, then we'd get one for "Guten morgen". Gee, thanks, couldn't figure that one out on my own. I had to rely on my German speaking pal to fill me in on some of the areas of the film. The best we could figure was that the subtitle man kept falling asleep on the job.If the film had been cut down from 107 minutes to, roughly, 15 or 20 minutes, maybe the pacing would have increased enough to keep a member of one of the actors' families interested in seeing how they looked 25 years ago, but that might be asking too much of them.It's too late for me, but save yourselves. Do not bother with this abysmal film!--David</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nosferatu the Vampire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this I thought it was complete rubbish, but then I forced myself to watch it again as it features in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, from director Walter Herzog (Grizzly Man). Basically it is remake of both the original film, as an alternative to the Bela Lugosi image of Count Dracula, or Count Orlock if you want to be technical. So you probably know the story, Jonathan Harker (Downfall's Bruno Ganz) is heading to Transylvania to complete the purchase of a house for vampire Count Dracula (Klaus Kinski). Harker is sucked out to the point of being almost completely paralysed, while the Count hiding in his coffin to avoid sunlight is heading to his home town. Dracula brings with him his plague of white mice to get all the innocent city people, moves into the new house just across from the Harkers, with a hardly moving Jonathan returned. Lucy Harker (Isabelle Adjani) realises the danger brought on by Dracula, so she is prepared to sacrifice herself to save Jonathan, and there is hardly any involvement with Dr. Van Helsing (Walter Ladengast). In the end, Count Dracula meets his end suffocating and has to be finished with a stake in the heart, oh, and Jonathan may be a near vampire himself. Also starring Roland Topor as Renfield. Kinski does make a reasonably creepy Count, but he is not effective as the rat-like spindly terror of Max Shreck in the 1922 original. It is slow, not much scary stuff, it has good music by Popol Vuh, and you just know deep down the 1922 silent original is more superior, but it's worth watching the once. Okay!</fullReview>
