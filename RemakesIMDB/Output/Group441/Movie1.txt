		<shortDescription>Heaps better than the remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure 'The Stepford Wives' spoke more to the audiences of 1975 than it does to the audiences of today, but this holds its own as decent, satisfying thriller. Really little more than a variation on 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers,' 'Stepford' follows that film's structure of slowly unspooling clues and suspicions and saving its bigger 'gotcha!' moments for the end. Katherine Ross was no doubt the star of this film, but Paula Prentiss really stood out for me. Gawky and enjoyable, she oddly predicted Geena Davis by a full generation. At one point in the film, my girlfriend commented of her wardrobe, 'Wow, can you imagine a grown woman today wearing a hot pant jumper?' The '70s? yikes!I had the misfortune of both seeing the remake of 'The Stepford Wives' before seeing the original and *actually seeing* the remake of 'The Stepford Wives.' If the original serves any purpose, it is to expose the remake for the gutless, toothless, anemic waste of everyone's time that it is. God, what a terrible movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Stepford Wives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems "The Stepford Wives" is enjoying a revival. However, it has been a cult movie since its release. As Gregory J. Paris writes, the act of losing one's personality while adjusting to conformity is an important issue in this film. In addition, it deals with man's obsession with "creating", until the day he realizes that the act of procreating is perhaps humanity's greatest gift for creation. It also reminds us of the cult to the mother figure, of the dangers of modern technocracies, of phallocracy? All these concepts are expressed in a peculiar form in "The Stepford Wives", a movie that deserves to be included among the best of Hollywood's second golden era, the 1970's. Director Bryan Forbes, producer Edgar J. Scherick, and, among the performers, actress Paula Prentiss, recognized comedy as an intelligent genre to make a social comment about society, with Stepford as a metaphor. With moving dolls bestowed with graceful movements, dressed in long dresses, wearing hats and carrying parasols, the tone of the sophisticated American comedy seems appropriate to tell this horror story. The connection with dolls is established since the first sequence, when --following husband Walter's unilateral decision-- the family is moving to Stepford, and the kids call mother Joanna's attention to someone carrying a mannequin across a street in New York City: this aspect is used again, most notably when Joanna hosts the Stepford husbands, dressed in a flesh-colored suit. In Stepford, a liberal suburb, with good schools, low taxes, pure air, and business dedicated to electronics, you can sleep with your doors open. Wives are all dressed up, they have no interest in women's rights, and except for Bobbie Markowe and Charmaine, the rest ?-when not cooking or ironing-- complain of not being able to bake every day, or would promote for free a brand of starch spray, just because it is such a good product. The funny thing is that the husbands are as boring and robot-like as their wives. They're all successful professionals, who obediently have joined the men's association, which turns into Joanna's headache and builds the tension of the film. There is little suspense in "The Stepford Wives", as we know it in other motion pictures: since the beginning we know that something is wrong, but the filmmakers make us watch the anomalous situation, with Michael Small providing music that is far from horror or suspense scores. What Forbes and company do is to tease us, because we know that Joanna will become Playmate of the Year (check the poster!), following the drawings of an ex illustrator from Playboy magazine, and the technical specifications of a former Disney executive. When she understands why Carol acts like a zombie, why Charmaine hangs her tennis outfit, and why Bobbie turns into a 'chic' housekeeper, Joanna is confronted with her own replica. Why? Because the males can. As simple as that: "Me Tarzan, you second person, you stick to the loser position in a game that I always win". "The Stepford Wives" reminds me of another movie, L.G. Berlanga's "Tama?o natural" (Life-Size), in which Michel Piccoli buys himself a plastic doll to replace his wife. Berlanga and his writers Rafael Azcona and Jean-Claude Carri?re emphasized psychological aspects. On "Stepford", while many of its comments add spice to the story (someone affirms that blackmail is what makes America great, another male has been sent to Panama maybe to arrange things for a new revolution or a new invasion), they also point to social and political reasons for this state of things, of this dehumanized community that money and know-how can buy. The technological paranoia enters the main bedroom. The male, confronted with the agony of some of his gender's privileges, his false attributes and wrong values, hits against the female. This may seem pessimistic, but it is also very realistic. The points "The Stepford Wives" made when released, created a controversy in 1975. Since then science has advanced. Maybe now they can make better Stepford wives, that cannot be altered by liquor or a stab, but many things related to the human heart remain the same. The problem is still there, because our egomaniac approach to our fellow human beings of any gender has remained basically the same, making the film actual still today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Like one of those robots in Disneyland..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Stepford Wives" certainly isn't the greatest thriller ever made, it isn't one of my all-time favorite movies, yet I've probably seen it 25 times and I'm always willing to return for more of its creepy, seductive ambiance. Director Bryan Forbes has created a funny/sinister atmosphere surrounding a secretive society of men in suburbia who exchange chilling glances and lines when they are alone ("She cooks as good as she looks, Ted."). It does however feature a very moody and unhappy Katharine Ross at the center, and it's easy to see why somebody might want to bump her off: she gripes, she complains, she stalks out of rooms flicking her long, thick hair out of her face. When Patrick O'Neal tells Ross at a social gathering that he used to work at Disneyland, she balks, "You don't look like someone who enjoys making other people happy." This just after meeting the man! Thank goodness then for happily crass and vulgar Paula Prentiss as Katharine's gal-pal Bobbie. Prentiss overdoes it a bit, but she comes into the picture at the right time and gives it an extra lift. The scenario (a squeaky clean Connecticut community) is gleefully turned inside out to reveal sinister underpinnings, and I loved Ross' sequence with the psychiatrist (who seems convinced by Katharine's outlandish story, which is a nice change of pace). No, it isn't art (or even the black comedy screenwriter William Goldman says he intended it to be), but "The Stepford Wives" is smooth, absorbing and enjoyable. It cooks as good as it looks. ***1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suburban Complacency is Dangerous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ira Levin must not like women, or hold them in high regard. In ROSEMARY'S BABY he put his leading lady through the worst pregnancy in literature, and once she got an ounce of courage to act on her own and escape the coven that surrounded her, he had an uninvolved doctor send her right back in. And now in THE STEPFORD WIVES, he does an almost by-the-numbers repeat of his previous novel (sans the supernatural in favor for extremely subtle science fiction overtones) and switches not only location but divides the genders, in which the men, viewed mainly as piggish dorks, are behind some shady business and are somehow married to these knockout (yet oddly vacant) hausfraus whose only motive in life seem to be discussing fabric softeners, cleaning at all time, and then cleaning some more.I presume most people, if not all unless they have been living under a rock or Siberia, will be acquainted with the plot, which in the novel is very short yet covers a period of four months, and in the movie moves along a little too slowly in the beginning but later starts to gather quiet force in a tightening noose, so I won't detail it here because to do so would not only be redundant but could not be done without revealing an important aspect of the movie. While the novel basically drops the secret midway by means of a poem Joanna Eberhart writes, the movie takes its time to let us in on the conspiracy which at the end reveals itself in that final, horrifying sequence at the Men's Association. And by then we've been outraged by the women's blighted feminism, and infuriated at the men who are little more than dangerous cavemen hiding behind technology and deceptive appearances.I don't know if Levin, in creating his story, was looking for satire or horror but he manages to (again) blend elements of the two in a short yet unforgettable book. The fact that "Stepford" has made its presence in today's vocabulary has a lot of debt to the story and of course, the shocking movie. Both work on different levels while giving us the same bleak ending, but the movie has Joanna conveying even more sadness at the end as the camera moves into the expression in her eyes, and one can see just how much has been quenched in the name of submission. Katharine Ross is great in giving us that visual sense of a woman's life snuffed in favor of a mannequin's programmed existence. For that, it deserves to be up there with another similar classic: INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, as stories about the Individual being forced into Assimilation by Complacency and Conformism, and Stepford couldn't spell it out better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, methodically paced thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film without knowing too much about it beforehand, which is the best way to get hit by its surprise revelations - so, as another reviewer suggested, don't read any reviews before seeing it, they'll probably spoil it one way or the other. It is fueled by the same fear that pervaded the "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" films - the loss of one's individuality. The director's careful, methodical pacing and his attention to detail may make the film seem slow to impatient viewers, but they pay off in some really chilling moments. Katharine Ross is extremely engaging in the lead....and (not to give anything away but) I'll never forget the image of the woman with no eyes. (***)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Perfect Wife</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>She is a meticulous housekeeper, flawless cook, thrifty shopper, adoring mother, perfect wife, always well groomed, always ready to please. But not, of course, a career woman, particularly if her success makes her husband feel belittled. Even today, more than thirty years after Ira Levin's bestseller startled the reading public, we are likely to refer to such a woman as "a Stepford wife"--a creature who seems both perfect and perfectly shallow.The 1974 film version follows the Levin novel quite closely. Joanna Eberhart is a beautiful young woman of the era in which the women's moment had come of age: intelligent, forthright, and meeting her husband on equal terms. Then she, her husband, and their children move from New York to the small town of Stepford, where she is dismayed to find that most of the neighboring women seem engaged in a competition to have the neatest house, the best-groomed children, the most satisfied husband. Joanna is relieved to find women like herself in newcomers Bobbie and Charmaine, but even so, it seems... odd. So odd that she begins to question her sanity.The film works on several levels, not the least of which is the macabre sense of humor with which director Byran Forbes endows the film: it is often very funny in a disquieting sort of way, as when Joanna and Bobbie's efforts to start a women's group results in a gathering of perfectly manicured women exchanging recipes and comparing floor polishes, or when Joanna and Bobbie accidentally overhear a Stepford couple making love. But for all the wittiness involved, THE STEPFORD WIVES is rooted in the women's movement of the 1970s, an era in which "a woman's place" was hotly debated on a national level. Just what is "a woman's place?" And to what lengths might men go to keep their women in traditional roles? Unlike many similar films, THE STEPFORD WIVES has tremendous restraint--and moreover a truly exceptional cast. Katherine Ross' talents were never before or after so well used, and Paula Prentiss gives perhaps her single most memorable performance here as Joanna's friend Bobbie. The supporting cast is equally fine, most particularly so with Patrick O'Neal as the unnerving "Diz" and a nice turn by Tina Louise as Charmaine.Ultimately, THE STEPFORD WIVES is something of a "one trick pony:" it works best on a first viewing, when you don't know what's coming, and on subsequent viewings the film tends to read as unnecessarily slow. Even so, it is an interesting little cultural artifact, an "almost classic" that is sure to give you pause the next time your better half announces he is joining a men's club. Recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Archiac" is not on the word list</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie holds up surprisingly well, nearly twenty five years after its first release. The premise could still intrigue today - there are still men who would like nothing better than to have the women in their lives be less human. I guess now women want the same things and this is known as progress. Anywho, the movie is great and if it were up to me, Katherine Ross' birthday would be a national holiday. She is terrific and beautiful and is matched by best buddy Paula Prentiss. Tina Louise and Nanette ("I'll die if I don't get this recipe") Newman are also memorable. The final shots of Ross are chilling, and top off a memorable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Summer Dresses and Big Brimmed Hats</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The image of beautiful, not necessarily sexy, women parading through the aisles of a grocery story in picturesque, almost Victorian summer dresses and wide white broad brimmed hats is one of the most lasting of this effective thriller based on the work by Ira Levin. Katherine Ross engagingly plays a women being moved with family in tow from the hustle and bustle of New York City to the serene suburbs of old Connetticut. Ross soon discovers that life for the gentle sex is anything but normal. All the women of Stepford seem to be concerned with is housecleaning and pleasing their husbands. This is a good, high energy film that shocks more from looks and what you do not see rather than what you do see. Helping greatly is a solid acting cast working with a pliable script. Though shot with an almost static effect at times, The Stepford Wives packs a few good punches. The scene in the grocery store and the scene with the empty eyes are just two of the highlights for me. Patrick O' Neal, lovely Tina Louise, and the ever loquacious Paula Prentiss costar. At the heart of the film is human identity and the worth it has/should have. There are aspects of social commentary abounding: the relationship of men and women in marriage, the effects of Suburban living, and the dangers of technology.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Dark Sci-Fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The urban aspirant photographer Joanna Eberhart (Katharine Ross) moves from Manhattan to Stepford, Connecticut, Massachussets with her family. Her husband Walter Eberhart (Peter Masterson) decided to live in a calm suburb, but Joanna did not like the neighborhood with beautiful and perfect housewives. She becomes friend of Bobbie Markowe (Paula Prentiss) and Charmaine Wimperis (Tina Louise), and when they change their behaviors and viewpoints, Joanna discloses a dark secret in the place.On 21 April 2005, I saw the remake of "The Stepford Wives" and I found it a funny entertainment. However, the original adaptation of Ira Levin's book is a suspenseful and very dark sci-fi, and certainly better and better than the 2005's version. When I was a teenager, Katharine Ross was one of my favorite actresses, and she is perfect in the role of an intelligent woman finding the truth hidden behind the complacency of such dedicated wives. The pace of this thriller is adequate, and the direction of Bryan Forbes is very good. I do not know why this great movie has not been released on VHS or DVD in Brazil. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "As Esposas de Stepford" ("The Wives of Stepford")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-done, entertaining thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Possible spoilers, but you probably already know the ending.** Katharine Ross, hubby and kids move from NYC to Stepford--a picture perfect town where all the women seem to be absorbed in housework. She slowly begins to realize that something is very wrong...A huge hit in its day, this film is dated but still holds up. Some people might see the film as anti-female but, really, the men come off very badly. And they are the villains. The acting is good--Ross (whatever happened to her?) is excellent as is Paula Prentiss as her VERY energetic best friend Bobbi. Also interesting to see Tina Louise (very good), Dee Wallace and Mary Stauart Masterson (as a little girl--no dialogue) in the mid 70s. The film isn't really scary (mostly because everybody knows the ending) and a little bit long, but it's still well worth catching. Also, personally, this film had a defining moments for me. I'm gay, and I saw the movie when I was 13 at a theatre. I didn't know I was gay...I just knew there was something different about me. When they show Ross' robot double with the HUGE breasts clearly visible my immediate reaction was "Ewwwwwwwww!" So, this movie helped me come out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent thriller... something is changing the women of Stepford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This contains spoilers.This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I did read the book before the movie came out and thoroughly enjoyed both the book and the movie. Katharine Ross has these haunting eyes which really makes the theme of the movie very realistic. It was a work of art how the Director had the cameras zoom in on her eyes as the focal point throughout the movie. Paula Prentiss was a perfect costar as her friend Bobby. She was ideal for the role.I also thought Nanette Newman brought timeless class and elegance to the movie as Carol Van Zandt. When there were complaints about her in the interview... I felt they were completely wrong. In the interview (included on the DVD), they claimed they had to change the costumes because Nanette would not have looked good dressed up as a playboy bunny... if that is the case, then she saved this movie. It would have turned into a ridiculous joke if they had dressed up all the women like sex bunnies as they talked about in the interview. The long sun dresses, white gloves and spring hats brought class and elegance to the movie. It made the movie more believable and taken seriously by the audience. It also made the movie memorable. Anytime someone sees this style, they think of Stepford. In fact, Stepford has become a part of our culture.The movie and the book both kept you on the edge of your seats wondering what was going to happen. The movie did improve upon some things that the book was not clear about. In the book, we were not certain whether they were doing something to the women to change them using technology or drugs... or if they were actually replacing the women with some kind of android or clone. There was no stabbing of Bobby in the book and Joanna never came face to face with her replacement. It was at that point when we saw she was being replaced with a robot automaton. Having the eyes incomplete let us know we were looking at an android and not a clone.The book had more storyline about the new couple in town, but we could see them arguing in the grocery store at the very end of the movie, just before they showed us the new Joanna.So with these new scenes added to the movie showing her stabbing Bobby and meeting the android... it actually made the movie better than the book... and that is rare. The book is still great, but the movie didn't leave us confused as to the actual fate of Joanna. But make no mistake; the book was still great.There is nothing about this movie which is against women. That concept is about as ridiculous as saying every serial killer movie is against men. This movie is more about how terrible the evil deeds these men are doing against the women. Don't let anyone talk you out of watching this movie. It is wonderful. I would have loved to have seen sequels made by the same cast and crew who did this movie. I did watch the other Stepford movies but they were nowhere close to the quality of this movie and cast. I can't seem to get enough of the Stepford movies and it is a shame they have not made them all into DVD's. But, I would have loved to have seen a followup to where this movie left off.As for the new movie with Kidman which made a joke out of this movie... I didn't appreciate it one bit. It was insulting, offensive and condescending of a great movie and a story which was a work of art. But since Hollywood can't seem to come up with their own story lines or fresh ideas... these wannabe's in diapers sit around trying to trash great movies made by others... I'm thankful that when they tried to do the same thing to make a new movie to ridicule Dallas, the actors squashed that idea. The public does not appreciate having beloved works of art trashed by low brows who have no class. Instead of trashing the work of others... they should see if they can do a better job... with original ideas.But this movie is wonderful. A great story, excellent cast, wonderful script with a great director who actually used genuine scenery and locations without having to waste money building a bunch of props or sets. This movie proves it doesn't require a bunch of special effects or CGI or fancy sets to make a movie with a great storyline and fantastic cast. This movie deserved a lot more credit and recognition than it received. I can't say enough nice things about it. If you have not seen it? you should do so. It is an exciting thriller with a fresh, original storyline at the time and doesn't have a boring moment in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still absolutely remarkable after all these years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE STEPFORD WIVES is an absolute classic of its type, and there is a reason why this amazing movie has managed to earn such a powerful place in popular culture and even slang terms. It presents an idea that has to be experienced fresh, without any previous knowledge of its concept and ideas, in order to be fully appreciated by first-time viewers. I was lucky enough to have had that opportunity years ago.If by some equally lucky chance you personally have no idea what this movie's concept is about and are completely innocent of it, let me pass on some helpful advice; read no further than this paragraph. The movie may seem to have a snail's pace, hokey acting and a dull layout but trust me, see it through to the end. Don't stop watching it whatever you do until it finishes. I'll just say that I envy your getting to experience this film for the very first time... I wish I could be in your shoes again.***SPOILERS AHEAD: All those who haven't seen or heard about this movie should stop reading here***Okay, those people will be SO lucky to get to experience this sharp fable for the very first time fresh, as it was intended. I have found it classified under several different categories in different videostores; "sci-fi", "horror", "thriller", "drama", and yes, "classic". The truth is that it fits into all those categories. But however you want to personally classify it, THE STEPFORD WIVES is a powerful movie with a powerful message to share.The movie nearly threatens to bore you to death at first as it lulls you into a fake feeling of comfort while it slowly starts dropping clues as to what is happening in the creepy little town of Stepford. After seeing it all the way through to its shocking conclusion, one can see that all the "bad acting" was deliberate and just how carefully crafted this mini-masterpiece really is.The performances are actually all top notch once you realize how the acting was "supposed to be" in the end. Joanne and her friends are all so well-portrayed and superbly acted that you find yourself rooting for them even when you don't realize at first just how serious their plight really is. And the dark portrayal of the character "Diz" (I USED to think *I* made that name up first! ACK!) is powerful, and made all the more insultingly evil when it turns out he used to work for Disneyland; like Pinocchio's "Stromboli" character, the connection of using the technology of such a happy and innocently beautiful place for such an evil purpose makes us loathe him all the more (one gets the impression that Diz was FIRED from Disneyland for being such a selfish and cruel snake).This movie has often been described as a Women's Lib statement. And, of course, it can definitely be taken that way. But it actually works on a far deeper level than that. There are two levels to it at once: it attacks the obnoxious stereotype of men out there who believe that all women should be slaves to mechanically do their bidding, AND it also savagely attacks the equally obnoxious stereotype of women out there who believe that all men are the selfish, heartless jerks that they are in this movie.And as extra "plus" points, the movie even makes huge proclamations about the importance of being true to yourself and not being forced to go along with blind conformity. The women are forced against their will to eventually become "bland conformists" void of personality, a strong statement of just how awful it would be if everyone was alike and how it is everyone's individuality that makes them so wonderful and special. This idea is further enforced by Joanne's obnoxious but weak husband; he goes along with the whole idea due to peer pressure, and all the while attempts to drink the pain away with tears in his eyes because he doesn't want to do it but is nevertheless too much of a coward to say "no" due to his desperately wanting to fit in with the "In" crowd (and that's a statement that EVERYONE can and does understand).This movie is a wonderful reminder of how it is our humanity and our individual personalities as people that make living so special. Many films have made that point, of course, but not many out there have managed to do so with the powerful "slap in the face" whallop of THE STEPFORD WIVES, an important film that still rings true in a world where people's special and individual qualities are becoming more and more ignored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was the spawn of an entire run of sequels, and now, (2004) a big-named, "fun" remake. But as "fun" as the remake is to watch, the real story is here in the original. This movie influenced an entire culture in the area of mind-control plots, and drastically changed the way most people viewed feminism. It is about Free Will, a woman's ability (and right) to stand on her own and make her own choices. It is about men, and their desire to cage and control the beautiful, free butterflies they've captured.PLOT: There's something odd about the women of Stepford. They are too friendly; too perfect. You soon learn that one, by one, they were murdered by their husbands and replaced with picture perfect robots who are programmed to serve with perfection. END PLOT.I won't say this is a masterpiece, but it *is* a strong work in dark suspense and diabolical intention. This is one of the more disturbing films of the 1970's, and definitely one for the collection, even if it is a bit dated.It rates an 8.3/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're thinking of not watching this movie because you saw the foul compilation of try hard comedy and nonsensical plot points that was the Nicole Kidman *shudder* remake, then completely forget you ever saw that movie because this couldn't be more different! It breaks the rules of horror movies, placing a chilling, thought provoking story of terror in beautifully tended to gardens, shining silverware and beaming sunlight.You speculate and hope things throughout the entire movie, everything drawing you in and keeping you compelled. Before you know it you become invested in Joanna, a headstrong photographer from New York who loves her children and finds herself stuck in suburbs swimming with smiling, seemingly perfect housewives. She encounters an accomplice Bobby, who is fresh and witty, and the two of them come to realize they are living in the mind game of misogynistic, archaic men who (as the women suspect but struggle to prove) have a dark, horrific plan for these women. You'll love the characters, have your heart shattered when you see what becomes of the ones you do genuinely enjoy and finish this movie knowing that you've just seen a brilliant adaption of a fantastic book. Good story, good acting, honestly it'd be a shame to not see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peace &amp; Harmony down Stepford Way!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This original of The Stepford Wives (remade in 2004, with Nicole Kidman) cajoles us in a typically 1970s middle class American way. The comfortable house, big estate car and cosy cinematography. The happy couple. This is all set to coax one into a sense of comforted security, one which, by the end, will send a real chill up through the spine.Or, are they? Obviously not, since they've moved from the City and out to the town of Stepford, which at first, seems gentle and almost too perfect. However, it is run by a secret committee of prominent men. They all have busy and difficult jobs and they all prefer a quiet and hassle- free home-life.I'm not giving too much away to say that the Stepford 'Wives' are in fact manufactured and mind-controlled servants to their husbands and perfect, physically. Our protagonist, Joanna, superbly played by Katherine Ross, doesn't agree with her husband, Walter, or his involvement with this men's committee and starts to rebel, a behaviour that doesn't go unnoticed.Attempting to start a rival, all female group, she also gets more and more aware and concerned by the sudden placidity of some of her new friends. Then, she feels for her life and for her children and then her worst nightmare begins.....The build-up, as I said, is skilfully and subtly built up, meaning that when, in its final throws, it's all the more shocking. I actually felt rather unwell.Many, quite rightly, highlight how perceptive this near 40 year old story was - and still is. The quest for eternal youth and women's rights and the changing role of women in the home is always a contentious one and this film is among the very best of its kind and is still very watchable - and much more sinister and original than the plastic re- make.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent thriller, dark comedy and social commentary that stays true to Ira Levin's novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bryan Forbes 'The Stepford Wives' is based on Ira Levin's 1972 bestselling novel. The plot follows Joanna, her husband Walter and her kids move from the big city to the peaceful suburban town of Stepford Connecticut where the wives 'cook as good as they look' and Walter joins a creepy and secretive men's association headed by an odd older man by the name of 'Diz' who once worked at Disney land making robots. Joanna, feeling isolated due to the lack of the wives activities, the seem to busy with house work and taking care of their families, befriends another new comer, Bobbie a fun and wacky woman, who like Joanna feels something sinister is behind the perfect wives behavior, and they intend to investigate, knowing that somehow, it's the men's association's doing...Part thriller, part dark comedy and part social commentary, The Stepford Wives is not only an intriguing film, but a great one as well. Katherine Ross as Joanna delivers an intense and gripping performance fighting for truth and individuality. Miss Paula Prentiss who plays Bobbie is superb and wins my choice as the best performer. She really inhabits the fun role.Bryan Forbes does a pretty good job as director, especially for an Englishmen, as let's face it, it's an American subject. What surprises me most about his directing is that one would think, if men wanted their wives perfect wouldn't they be dressed in play boy bunny suits and tan and blond? Apparently not, as he chooses to make them proper but sexy still. (It is said that he choose this due to the casting of Nanette Newman who was in her 40's and wouldn't look right dressed in 'playboy' type clothing) Besides, the wives act more Victorian, much like their clothing (which happens to be long dresses and skirts) The Stepford Wives is sort of slow, but bear with it as the slowness creates a high tension level, and unravels the mystery, Because, although the film isn't gory, it's chilling and subtle. The ending, is well, I won't spoil, but it's very dark, haunting and honestly sad.One fact, and it clearly shines through the film, is that it's a film that really is also about the woman's liberation movement of the early seventies (this is the social commentary kickin' in) you can tell through the writing clearly, in fact the message that these awful men have overpowered woman by making them the way they want them to doesn't strike you? For fan's of Ira Levin's novel, you won't be disappointed as they're not only on the same par, but it's a strongly faithful adaption that gets the characterization right and the message clear.Final Verdict-'The Stepford Wives' is a great thrilling, chilling, excellent film with a wonderful script and great performances.****/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a classic paranoia thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ginuenly creepy, this classic 70's thriller based upon Ira Levin's novel is still an effectively suspenseful film.Housewife moves to a Conneticut town where she discovers that the women live in a weird, constant state of mindless bliss. But why?Clever premise, engrossing plot, and a steady build up of fear and tension keeps The Stepford Wives a truly intelligent psychological thriller. The film plays out in an oddly poetic light, with some themes that made it ahead of it's time. Director Bryan Forbes does a great job of making a setting as seemingly innocent as a suburban neighborhood into a place of uncomfortable dread. All the more helpful are the films well-drawn characters and the question of just what role they play in this mystery.The cast is excellent, the best being star Katharine Ross.A rewarding thriller all the way, The Stepford Wives remains a classic for good reason.*** 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Katharine Ross gives her best performance in this modern day horror / science fiction masterpiece. For odd, but explainable reasons, the Stepford Wives looks a little like Suspiria and I Spit on Your Grave. Since it was shot in the 1970's, the movie is somewhat of a time machine that allows us to look back at a different time. The ending's climax makes the movie a true horror movie as the hallway's of the Men's Association looks a lot like the Girl's Dance Conservatory in Suspiria. The look of the movie seems low budget at times, but this simple use of direction and story telling adds to the setting of Stepford. Ross is perfect for the role. It is a giant slap in the face when Ross sees her robot-like self with bigger breasts that her. This adds to the idea of Men wanting to control their wives and wanting certain things from them. Even for the 1970's, this is a giant push back to the 1950's with human / women's rights. Scary and utterly horrific by the end, the Stepford Wives is a success as the movie makes its audience think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS FOLLOW!This is an excellent thriller. It has good acting, great directing, excellent writing, and, most importantly, the element present in all three, and tragically missing from far too many thrillers today... subtlety. Suspense increases very slowly. It doesn't REALLY become apparent that something's amiss until Carol Van Sant begins wandering around at the barbecue repeating, "I'll just DIE if I don't get this recipe."Best about the movie is this: The utter perfection of the women of Stepford is, through most of the film, not portrayed in a threatening or malicious manner. In fact, I find their dazed conversations about cleaning to be quite amusing. There is no unified cry of "Join us! Join us!" usually typical of films like this. But the danger is evident nonetheless. And the suspense continues to build, until we get to the scene wherein Joanna stabs the Stepford Bobbie, who then begins to malfunction... one of the scariest things I've seen in a very long time.And finally we get to the closing scene. The way the scene will play out is evident from the first (we are, of course, going to see the new Stepford Joanna). But it's extremely well executed. Just watching the Stepford Wives walk up and down the supermarket aisles sent shivers up my spine. Not to mention a brief glimpse of the latest resident of Stepford, as yet unaware of the fate that awaits her. Absolutely incredible.One problem: In a film that otherwise has incredible pacing in the building of suspense, the music, especially at the beginning, blares unearthly notes during some of the most subtle scenes, as if to proclaim, "HEY! THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG, HERE!" It's not TOO imposing, though. And aside from that, the movie is nearly flawless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers A friend of mine who had just watched this film told me that once I saw it, the term "Stepford Wife" would enter our lexicon of references. He was right about that.Joanna moves with her husband to Stepford, CT. While Walter is at work, Joanna and her new friend Bobbie are both appalled at the behavior of the wives of Stepford, a bunch of milfs who all seem to have come from dish-washing detergent commercials. At first, I thought that this film too deeply resembled "Rosemary's Baby". The couple moves into a new place and slowly realizes that something bizarre is going on, although it doesn't appear life-threatening. The difference becomes more and more obvious, and the married couple grows further and further apart. The oddities in both films put their heroines in an ominous subtlety that they find frustrating or almost impossible to explain to other members of the cast, and the women wonder if it is they, themselves who are the oddities.The strategy is rather obvious; after about four months, the men take their wives off to a "weekend getaway," and when the couple returns the wife is another brain-dead subservient slave to her husband. The wives sure don't catch this, even though it appears as though the suspicious Joanna and Bobby probably would have figured it out. Its technical and social references make the film appear dated; It is quite laughable that the Stepford Wives could get their entire vocabulary from recording their voices into a microphone. I also don't see what is so shocking about a guy groping his girl on the front lawn--hey, some of us do that all the time!Where the film works is in its payoff, which surprisingly, I didn't predict. I thought that these women were being hypnotized or lobotomized, or something else. Where it becomes chilling and eerie, is when we learn that indeed, these women will never return to their original selves. I figured Joanna's friend Bobbie would "snap out of it," however, Joanna stabs her, and the model goes haywire--this isn't Bobbie--Bobbie is dead. Looking back, certain clues for us are eerie, like Walter's first dream-like encounter with a Stepford wife, or even hilarious, like one man's smiling expression along with his "thumbs up," gesture as he tears up his wife's tennis court to make room for his new swimming pool.And then there is Joanna's final scene, which holds up disturbingly well, as does the thought that the wives were created by someone who used to work at Disneyland. I think that deep-down we all find animatronic humanoids quite creepy, as there seems to be an almost sinister magic behind the lovable robots on the rides we enjoyed as children and still do today. When we meet Janet's stacked (nice touch!) replica, she appears without eyes. It is an image and a haunting ending that probably couldn't be as frightening if it were done today (oh yeah, they are remaking it). I'm glad I didn't see this film as a child.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard a little bit about The Stepford Wives recently on a TV show, they showed little clips of the movie and I knew I had to see it. I saw the sad thing that they called the remake of the Stepford Wives, wasn't impressed and I think part of that made me want to turn away from the story, but I found the rental and watched it the other day, this movie just creeped me out. I couldn't believe how scary it was, I know that it may seem a bit tame to others, especially in today's world, but I think it was the whole concept and the ending that really got to me. Just think about it, men wanting a "perfect" wife so badly that they'd kill them and replace them with robots? Just thinking about the subject makes you think and the film makes a clever and well acted cult classic thriller.Joanna and Walter have just moved to Stepford, everything seems just so perfect, a little too perfect, Walter has a great new job with tons of friends, Joanna has made some friends too. Some of the women are normal and are in the women's lib movement, some are just a little to Mrs. Beaver, doing everything that a husband could want: cook, clean, make love constantly, and just keep her mouth shut at certain times. But when things get a little too suspicious when one of Joanna's friends who was with her on the women's movement has become all "Stepford", she starts to wonder what's really going on.The Stepford Wives is definitely a classic in it's own right and really is a conversation movie. I admit that it's lost a little edge within time, but if you just think about the subject, it really is disturbing, Katherine Ross pulls in a terrific performance, especially in the "I bleed" scene, how scary that must have been for her character, you'll see what I mean. I would recommend this for movie buffs or if you're looking for a creepy thriller to watch, this is a fun classic and is always the perfect joke for our "Stepford" wives of today.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joanna Eberhart (Katharine Ross) has moved to Stepford with her husband and children. The place seems absolutely idyllic. But it's not long before Joanna and her new found friend Bobbie (Paula Prentiss), also new to Stepford, begin to realize not all is as wonderful as it seems. The women in town seem to have no interests other than cleaning their houses and pleasing their husbands. Is it something in the water? Joanna and Bobbie must discover the mystery of Stepford before they become its next victims.While The Stepford Wives may be slow going, it never gets dull. The slow pace adds a lot to the mystery. I've often argued that for effective suspense, you can't rush it. It takes time to build. And even though I knew exactly where The Stepford Wives was going, it was a joy to watch the mystery unfold.Two of the biggest things the movie has going for it are the cast and the script. As for the cast, Katharine Ross and Paula Prentiss are outstanding. Ross plays her role in a very understated manner and isn't quick to jump to wild conclusions without adequate proof. Too often, characters in horror movies will jump to the wildest of conclusions without a shred of evidence. It makes things very unrealistic. As for Prentiss, she steals every scene in which she appears. And her character is one of the most intelligent, yet free-spirited characters I've seen recently in a movie. In fact, given the implausibility inherent in the story, the entire script is written intelligently. The characters speak and act as one would expect given the circumstances. Plus, any script with the phrase "Madienform Bonfire" is alright with me.I suppose my biggest complaint would be the lack of time given to the mansion that houses the Stepford Men's Association. I kept waiting for Joanna and Bobbie to do some amateur sleuthing, but it never happened. And even when Joanna finally gets inside, it's over far too quickly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An atmospheric suspense thriller where the everyday becomes chilling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read The Stepford Wives when I was 12 years old and have re-read it several times since then. Ira Levin's specialty is taking his characters from seemingly ordinary live situations and building a quiet sense of menace and unease. I originally saw the movie as a teen-ager in 1976 and thought it compared very favorably to the book. Great casting; Katharine Ross is a superb Joanne and I appreciate her understated performance even more nearly 30 years later. You feel her uneasiness, her wariness and her disbelief as she grows to realize that the men of Stepford are killing their wives and replacing them with robot replicas who are fascinated with housework and compliant in the bedroom.While womem and male-female relationships have progressed over the past 30 years, there is still a long way to go and females are just as guilty of perpetuating the stereotype of a dependent, submissive housewife. The themes and fears are universal and timeless, sexism in America unfortunately is still rampant and both women and men are conflicted about their roles. The film has an atmosphere where the everyday environment becomes filled with menace and the ending stays with you, long after the film has ended. I highly recommend this film as well as Ira Levin's novel. Worth reading and worth watching - more than once (especially on a rainy or snowy evening).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I'll just DIE if I don't get this recipe!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those who dismiss "The Stepford Wives" as absurdist 1) miss the black comedy/satirical point, and 2) obviously never lived in an affluent Connecticut suburb. I grew up not too far from where "The Stepford Wives" was filmed, and trust me, this film got the mileu exactly right.Despite its apparent lack of blockbuster success upon its 1975 release, the film has aquired an almost mythic reputation; indeed, even those who have never seen the movie or read the book upon which it's based will recognize the term "Stepford wife" when applied to a particularly vapid, "perfect" homemaker.*SPOILERS!*The plot is simple and scary: Joanna (Katharine Ross) moves to the seemingly perfect burg of Stepford, Connecticut, at the insistence of her husband. There, the liberated (this is the 70's, after all) Joanna is shocked to find every housewife seems to be right out of a Betty Crocker commercial. Are they really all so thrilled to be dedicated homemakers, cooks and sex objects? And just what is this "men's association" that demands so much of the husbands' time? Joanna's shock turns to paranoia as she begins to suspect that some kind of evil force is behind the all-too-perfect veneer of Stepford. She makes a new friend, Bobbie (Paula Prentiss), who is also a newcomer to Stepford. Both women are determined to find out exactly what is causing "us to turn into hausfraus!" What Joanna discovers, to her horror, is that the "association" is behind the killing of the wives, only to replace them with programmed robots. In one of the most famous scenes, Joanna learns that Bobbie has "Stepford-ized," and stabs her in the stomach with a carving knife--only to have "Bobbie" malfunction rather than bleed!Yes, this is high camp; the sight of Prentiss mechanically dropping coffee cup after coffee cup while spinning around and muttering, "I thought we were friends! I thought we were friends!", as computerized bleeps and squiggles dominate the soundtrack, is darkly funny--but also very, very spooky. That such ridiculous scenes play well as both camp and black humor suggests that this is what the filmmakers had in mind all along.Katharine Ross is beautiful and perfectly cast as Joanna; she doesn't really hit any highs or lows, but conveys the character's fear and frustration well. Paula Prentiss, on the other hand, is hysterically funny and over-the-top. She comes off as a big, goosy drag queen--sort of like Jack Lemmon's characterization of "Daphne" in "Some Like it Hot"! Nannette Newman took some critical heat because she was primarily cast due to her marriage to Bryan Forbes, the film's director, but she's perfect as Carol. Some insisted that the older more matronly Newman didn't fit in with the idea that the Assocation wanted a line of perfect, young, beautiful trophy wives; but Newman isn't exactly Totie Fields, and, after all, wouldn't a suburb-full of Playboy Bunnies make Joanna and Bobbie head back to New York City without even a second thought? Newman also gets off the most memorable line in the film: malfunctioning at a surreal garden party, she intones to every guest: "I'll just DIE if I don't get this recipe!"Look for the absolutely stunning Tina "Ginger" Louise as Charmaine--in her initial, pre-robotic scenes, she's salty and brassy and incredibly sexy. What a shame she was forever typecast and left to waste away on "Gilligan's Island." The only real complaint I would have is that little or no motivation is given for the husbands' willingness to kill their wives and have them replaced by these domestically- and anatomically-perfect doubles. In the end, though, I suppose it's irrelevant. The film's message, if entertainment MUST have a message, is really a manifesto against a male dominated society's unwritten, unspoken and pretty much unchallenged desire to control women.Forbes' direction is slick and assured, and aided by the gauzy, soft-focus photography and EZ-listening score. Believe me, towns like Stepford really did exist (still do?), and this movie not only made me laugh very hard, but also scared the hell out of me--because it made the reality that much more chilling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deliberate and chilling thriller that's dated, but not totally irrelevant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many films involving social commentary are still quite relevant many years after their release. This can be a really frightening thing and you wonder why things haven't changed too much. For instance, John Carpenter's 'They Live' is more than twenty years old now, but it was a comment on things going on at the time that are eerily similar to today. In some ways of course these films are dated, which sometimes can make them seem more like camp. Coming after the start of the Second Wave of the Feminist movement, 'The Stepford Wives' is a story of men who can't accept that their wives want to be successful outside the home. All these years later it can still send shivers up the spine.Pros: Solid performances from a great ensemble cast. Intelligently written. Suspenseful direction. Good and often chilling score. Dark sense of humor. Perfectly paced. Beautiful cinematography and scenery. A few really eerie scenes and images.Cons: In some ways quite dated. At least a couple major plot holes.Final thoughts: Great progress has been made since the time of this film and Ira Levin's novel, that's for sure. The bad news is that there are still men with the mindset of the one's in the movie. Of course when you think about it the concept of turning anyone into a robot so they can cater to your every whim is absurd, but that doesn't mean there aren't people who wish it. A really good old fashioned thriller like they used to make them.My rating: 4.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far better than the sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a kid I had the pleasure of attending this shoot during the summer of 1974 in Redding, Connecticut. The interior scenes of the Eberhart's home were filmed in my family's best friend's colonial house in Redding: living room, kitchen, stairs, halls, bedroom and even attic (no sets!). Interior evening shots were made realistic by the presence of black paper placed over the exterior of the windows (you can see wrinkles if you look closely). Frontal exterior shots were of a different house but backyard scenes were actual. Additionally, scenes were shot all around Fairfield County that we were all very familiar with (Darien, Norwalk and Westport). It is great to watch the film and see the home I spent so much time in long ago- our friends sold the house not long after filming. It was all very exciting at the time. However, the movie was only as good as the book, which, honestly, even for Ira Levin, was not that great. I will not recite the plot as we all know it well. However, the film stands out in areas of acting, cast selection, and by all means, cinematography! The lush colors portrayed on screen truly give the film a lovely, almost surreal country feel that truly represented this suburban area in summertime. Katherine Ross gives an admirable performance but the standout certainly is Paula Prentiss. Paula's portrayal of Bobbie is worth the time to sit through this movie. Plus, it is fun to see Tina Louise who gives a great performance! A creepy movie that far outweighs the pathetic sequel. Recommend!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A tame, but satisfying thriller by British director Bryan Forbes, known for Whistle Down the Wind(61), The L-Shaped Room,(63), Seance on a Wet Afternoon(64) and The Whisperers(67). Based on Ira Levin's novel, it's a tale of justifiable paranoia, and Forbes' low key direction is effective. As Joanna, a new-to-Stepford wife, Katherine Ross is likable and sympathetic; she's virtually in every scene in what is probably her best screen performance. Scene-stealer Paula Prentiss is a hoot as her new best friend. Ross and Prentiss are the Thelma and Louise of SciFI;their friendship is believable, and provides the necessary human element. In support, Peter Masterson, Tina Louise and Nanette Newman stand out. The film is compelling even if the audience is ahead of Joanna for too long. The film can be enjoyed as satire, horror or both. There's no point comparing it to the dreadful remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Stepford Wives (1974)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The lovely Katherine Ross stars here as Joanna, who reluctantly moves with her husband, Walter (Peter Masterson) and children from New York City to the so called ideal suburban community of Stepford, Connecticut.The Stepford Wives is based on a novel by Ira Levin, who also wrote Rosemary's Baby. The two stories have a lot in common. Paranoia is a central theme in both films. They also touch on such themes as chauvinism and of course social commentary.Katherine Ross and the film are at it's best with the slowly building of Joanna's paranoia and the realization that her dreams are now becoming a nightmare....and that she's next. Course, those who like their movies to be a little faster paced, need not apply.Are the suburb's women happy to be vapid homemakers? Or is there a more shocking secret behind this domestic perfection? And what exactly does go on in those secret meetings? What did she ever see in her husband anyway?) The only thing I didn't quite like about the film was the whole relationship between Walter &amp; Joanna. I'm sorry, but they simply just didn't seem as if they were married to each other. I didn't buy their whole relationship for one second. He was a real dick from start to finish.Some really strong scenes throughout the film. But, the one that gave me the biggest creeps was that ending-those android's eyes. Of course, the coloured couple arguing in the supermarket - we know who's next! I was also creeped out by that scene on the school bus scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I could give this movie 20 stars I would. Movie was fascinating and creepy, a heck of a good time. Ira Levin is a genius at making the everyday into something horrifying and unnatural. The movie deals a lot with paranoia. The beginning and middle of the movie is not scary at all, toward the end it gets crazy. The movie is simply about a beautiful woman named Joanna Eberhart, who moves with her husband and two children from New York to the lovely town of Stepford,Conneticut. But as Joanna gets settled in her new home, she realizes that something is odd about all the wives of Stepford. All the wives are perfect domestic slaves who live and breathe to please their husbands and constantly keep their homes looking like a Mr. Clean commercial. Joanna and her new found friend Bobbie, whom hasn't come under the curse of Stepford yet, set out to solve the mystery of Stepford and all it's Martha Stewart clones. What Joanna uncovers is shocking and horrific. The truth of Stepford will leave you with chills and an ending you will never forget. Katharine Ross who played Joanna is spectacular. Her performance leaves you wanting more. Her performance is flawless and her beauty is timeless. Paula Printiss also leaves you with an unforgettable performance. She'll have you laughing constantly and wondering what she'll say next. She was perfect for the role of Bobbie. Overall I would have to say that this movie is perfection down to the very last detail. And is worth renting or even buying. It is by far on my top ten list of favorite movies, and thats saying a lot. Watch it. You wont regret it.</fullReview>

This is creepy in a way that really touches something inside of me, the fear that identity can be so easily lost in the right environment. Sure, the plot was all pretty predictable, but the transformation of someone real into someone so unreal is unsettling because we have seen it happen to people in own lives.

		<fullReview>I'll admit I saw the 2004 remake which starred Nicole Kidman and Bette Midler, when it was first released in cinemas simply because I was intrigued by the good cast. I'd never been that keen on comedy thriller but fell in love with and bought it when it came out in December.Having heard it was a remake from a 1975 sinister thriller; which starred Katherine Ross and Paula Prentiss, and from a novel by Ira Levin ? the same man who wrote the menacing Rosemary's Baby, I decided to give it a chance and rent in May this year.The plot synopsis is pretty simple about a couple (Ross and Masterson) who move to the town of Stepford where a dangerous secret lies, revolving around why all the wives seem to be devoted to their husbands and are un-human-like.From the minute we begin watching this film,. We instantly know it is a dark and sinister thriller which will haunt you throughout the movie, but is carefully hidden in the beautiful countryside of Stepford. The silent opening credits is also rather eerie.Katherine Ross and Paula Prentiss are both excellent in their roles not to mention beautiful! Both were prefect choices for their roles, although It'd be interesting to see Susan Sarandon playing the role of Joanna, as she was originally scheduled to play the role. The supporting cast are equally excellent, particularly from Peter Masterson, Nanette Newman, Patrick O'Neal and Tina Louise.The only key problem with this movie would be, from my memory, we don't actually learn much about how the robots work and how they're programmed ? trivial but disappointing.My own personal displeasure would be the ending. I won't spoil it but it isn't as satisfying as the remake, which I still like immensely, but I suppose that's my fault for seeing it before the original. Ira Levin is defiantly one of the best authors who can leave us with a chilling feeling that lurks for sometime after the credits have finished. Bryan Forbes was also an excellent choice to direct.None the less it was a creepy but fun way to spend a Saturday night and I strongly recommend this as a pure date-flick or a sleepover film. Extremely underrated and I strongly suggest you watch this!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although it starts as a common life sort of drama about a married couple and their problems this film must be watched keeping in mind its a thriller and a sort of sci-fi product.Director Bryan Forbes takes the best out of Ira Levin's unpretentious novel and builds an entertaining and most enjoyable product in the genre. He achieves an accurate and tense atmosphere that increases constantly as the picture runs towards its climax at the sinister and sordid Stepford men's club.Katharine Ross renders a perfect performance as the all-feminist Joanna Eberhart and so does Paula Prentiss as her sloppy friend Bobbie. Patrick O'Neal looks sinister enough as the former Disneyland engineer that has decided to create the perfect society through perfect man-woman relationships (perfect for men that is). Perhaps a better choice than Peter Masterson as Joanna's husband and a little more depth in this character would have improved the film. Stunning Tina Louise is there too.This 1975 picture is much better than the recent version with Nicole Kidman and Matthew Broderick. I've always wondered why whenever they remake films they feel forced to add some sort of an extra final twist in the plot that only hurts the product badly (Mel Gibson's "Ransom" compared to Glenn Ford's 50's first version being a perfect example).If you enjoy thrillers don't miss this one. A more than acceptable product in its genre, you'll surely enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some people's fantasies occasionally go a little too far...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Boys from Brazil", "The Stepford Wives" has the distinct feeling of an Ira Levin novel: the slowly but surely evolving sense that something isn't right. In this case, Joanna Eberhart (Katharine Ross) and husband Walter Cresby (Peter Masterson) move to the small town of Stepford, Connecticut, to start a new life. Stepford seems like the perfect town; the only problem is, it's a little too perfect. Because there's a dark secret at work. And if Joanna discovers it, that could be her end.I admit that the premise seems a little far-fetched, but they do a good job with it. We might say that it's about male chauvinist fantasies, but don't quote me on that. It's especially weird now that I know that Tina Louise played one of the roles (I hadn't yet started watching "Gilligan's Island" when I saw this movie); in fact, her replacement for the show's reunions also appears here.Either way, you're likely to get very shocked by what happens here. I have warned you, so watch at your own risk. The 2004 remake was also pretty interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a brilliant, witty, and very frightening satire of many men and their obsession with having a servile fantasy woman at their beck and call. This dates back especially to the 50's in terms of the societally accepted domestic service of women. Even "I love Lucy" had an episode "proving" the ineptitude of women anywhere outside of the kitchen and, in turn of men in the kitchen. This film is a brilliant critique of just that. This is an issue that is still present in today's society. Women are still expected to be submissive in one way or another to men. They are expected to live up to an ideal of sexual, and robotic perfection. The 70's was a time when many issues like this were being addressed, today we seem to have gone backwards as a society dealing with this issue, forgetting what we learned as a country and as a world then. We seem eternally trapped in some 50's mindset, suffering amnesia, as brilliant movies like this gather dust and its meanings misinterpreted. This film is a classic. Brilliant from start to finish. Some people have complained about the macabre ending, with robot women doing the shopping. This ending is designed to be a warning, a signal of how carried away men can get. How carried away our society can get. After all this is also a horror film, never usually a happy ending there. People should be viewing this film more and more especially in today's culture. This is a sometimes funny, very witty, and very frightening critique of our culture's interpretation of sex and conformity. Brilliant film, stunning, one of the all time best. A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Stepford Wives is a good movie because of its portrayel of social (feminist) issues of its time. The movie present the struggles and anxieties that "modern" women faced and the ideals that they valued. Katherine Ross did a terrific job in her representation of Joanna Eberhart. She was the epitomy of a women who was unconvintional and who upheld her own independance. She's a women who strives not just to be a wife and mother, but to be an individual capaple of contributing to society.The movie is quite powerful. It's frustrating, dismal, and the ending isn't happy. The audience questions the motives of women they know who are "Stepford Wives". Although some may percieve the movie as being a demonstration of how women are powerless and will loose the gender battle, the movie seems to serve as more of an alert. It's like a call for people to open their eyes and question men and their motives towards women, and women to question themselves, making sure they are individuals.The characters the embody Stepford Wives in the movie make the viewer sick. Nobody (man or women), can walk away from the movie thinking it portrays and ideal situation. In this way it highlights the importance of love over beauty and service in marraige.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror of ideas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To comply with IMDB rules, I must begin by warning you that this review contain a possible spoiler -- which leads nicely to my first point. THE STEPFORD WIVES is a movie that suffers from what I call the `Spoiled by Recognition' problem. If a movie hinges on some key fact being concealed from the viewer until the end, the movie is almost impossible to discuss or review without revealing at least some part of the ending. Therefore, the more recognition the movie receives, the harder it is for you to be a first-time viewer who hasn't already tripped over at least some of the spilled beans.You can still appreciate such a movie, however, if you go into it with the right mindset. My mother has always said she enjoys reading an Agatha Christie murder mystery twice -- the first time to experience the mystery, the second time to see how all the events in the story were cleverly engineered to lead up to the resolution without actually giving it away. If the resolution has been given away, you can read the novel this way the first time around. In the case of THE STEPFORD WIVES, even if you've already been told what the men in Stepford are doing, you can still appreciate how it's revealed only in stages, along with Joanna and Bobbie's growing terror as they slowly uncover the secret.Of course, a smart story teller will anticipates the `Spoiled by Recognition' problem and offer something of interest besides the big revelation. In the case of THE STEPFORD WIVES, this is accomplished partly through the use of the mystery/thriller format, in which the protagonist solves a mystery and uncovers an imminent danger in the process. The mystery is solved before the story's conclusion, and the focus shifts to averting the danger. Once Joanna figures out what's being done, the question becomes that of whether she can keep it from being done to her.But truly makes THE STEPFORD WIVES worth your time, even if you've stepped on those spilled beans, are the questions and issues raised by the story. This is a story about the role some men want women to play, and about the lengths those men will go to to force women into that role. It might also be considered an allegorical deal-with-the-devil story, because the men of Stepford are effectively selling not only the souls of their wives, but their own souls as well. This allegorical overtone is interesting, given that this movie is based on a novel by Ira Levin, who also wrote ROSEMARY'S BABY, which involved a literal deal with the devil. (And ROSEMARY'S BABY is a movie that has the `Spoiled by Recognition' problem really bad because it's a classic.)Indeed, the horror in THE STEPFORD WIVES is very much a horror of ideas, rather than a horror of physical events, which is likely to frustrate you if you're looking for a thrill ride along the lines of NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. Now, don't get me wrong. I have an appetite for gross-out horror as well, but I think it's important to realize horror can come in other forms as well -- which can be just as effective.I will concede that THE STEPFORD WIVES might have been more suspenseful; at a nice tight 90 minutes, but both the characters and the situation might have come off as flat and wooden. As it is, there's a much stronger sense of reality, which makes what finally does happen that much more frightening and disturbing.Finally, I'd like to address one other complaint you may have about this movie -- that it never explains the mechanics of HOW the men are doing what they're doing. The answer is that it really doesn't't matter how. What matters is that they ARE doing it and WHY they're doing it. By way of comparison, I would cite Franz Kafka's classic novella, THE METAMORPHOSIS, in which it is never explained HOW Gregor Samsa turns into a giant insect. It isn't explained, because it isn't germane to the point of the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Effort for a Bizarre Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One must be realistic-- the plot of "The Stepford Wives" is not all that brilliant, or even unique. It deals with the same themes as much better movies have featured. Yet there is something appealing about this film.I think that much credit should go to director Forbes for making such a strange concept so enjoyable. He deals with the material with just the right touch-- he does not take it too seriously, which is perfect for the tone of the film. He does not attempt to give you any great scares, but he lets the creepy clues haunt you until you figure out what's going on. And there are some memorable moments: i. e., a scene in which one of the housewives acts very oddly at a friendly picnic. The performances, too, are worth note. Katharine Ross, despite her character's somewhat obnoxious behavior on various occasions, is quite appealing by the end. And both the direction and acting on the part of the blandly happy, slavish housewives is quite effective. The film's only real shortcoming, that detracts from its status as an well-made chiller is the unimaginative conclusion. It left me, at least, rather unsatisfied. But still, "The Stepford Wives" is a nicely wrapped little package, if the package only contains fluffy material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>She's the perfect suburban housewife, submissive, upbeat, uncomplaining, and a tiger with the cleaning rag and lacy nightgown. But above all, she's unthinking. That might bring on worries that would mar her otherwise perfect domestic tranquility. Sound like a male chauvinist fantasy? Probably. But it strikes me as a feminist attack on the Good Housekeeping ideal that was pieced together from a 1,001 TV commercials. Then too, there's more than a little Invasion of the Body Snatchers in this 1974 production, but without the panache or panic of that earlier (1956) classic. Stepford's an interesting film, especially when Nanette Newman's perfect wife starts repeating herself like a stuck record. It's really a horror film as the thunder and lightning of the climactic scene underscores, but the filming plays more like mystery-suspense as we try to figure out what's up with these women. It could have been a lot spookier than it is. Director Bryan Forbes seems more interested in the story than in atmospherics; at the same time, events build nicely into a rather predictable ending. This is, after all, post-Nixon and Vietnam. Director Don Siegel wanted a similar ending to Body Snatchers but the studio wouldn't allow it. Those were, after all, the sunny Eisenhower years when upbeat endings were required.Two scenes stay with me. Men from the club enter Ross's bedroom, look around, then leave in unexplained fashion. Good mysterious note that later falls into place. The club meets at Ross's house, her husband included. So what does Ross wear for the all-male occasion-- a figure-hugging sheath with absolutely no underwear. I never heard a word of dialogue the whole time. All in all, it's a clever horror-spoof of 1950's suburbia, with one overriding distinction. How many other movies have had a title word become part of our common descriptive vocabulary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bryan Forbes, an excellent director when working with black and white, shows skill with colour too in this film. In particular blues are constantly featured, in lighting, shadows, everywhere, providing a sense of foreboding and something unnatural, such as the secret behind the title town. Greens also play an important part, but there is more than just colours to Forbes' vision of the material. There are typically effective long distance shots set up by the director, and his use of shadows and close-ups really aid in telling the tale. The film's supporting characters are developed quite lightly, and although in the context of the film this makes sense, adding to the protagonists' feeling of helplessness, they are so intriguing that I at least would have liked to have known them better. It is not a large problem though, and there are hardly any large faults in the film. The noise of certain scenes is overbearing at times, but then again, this helps Forbes' contrast in sound between two different environments - one of which is unnaturally quiet. The acting is not too hot shot, and some of the music choices do not quite fit in, but the virtues of this film are superb. It is not often recognised for being so, but I would certainly call this a bit of a mini-masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent adaption of Ira Levin's classic sci-fi horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Ira Levin's satirical novel The Stepford Wives is a story that at first seems like a simple thriller but on a closer look offers so much more. It doesn't just offer effective psychological suspense, work as a commentary on society's pursuit of youth and perfection, it is also a sci-fi horror with touches of dark humour and the best part is that it only gets better when you re-watch it. For the most part the film moves along slowly and quietly, painting a peaceful picture of a suburban dream life and even when Joanna begins to suspect something is amiss nothing in the movie gives away just how life shattering the town's secret is. It is not until the climatic end that the horror truly pokes it face out and sends chills down your spine and knowing the secret from the beginning means the chills are there from the very start when re-watching the movie. As the movie is shown from Joanna's perspective a lot of the horror happens unseen to us and as you think back on the movie those horrors will play for your inner eye and set thoughts in motion which makes this an incredibly strong movie with more impact than a simple jump-scare horror. While the movie has been criticized for being anti-feminist Stepford is clearly more chauvinistic dystopia than heaven and the men are cold and flat characters compared to the fleshed-out warm and strong females. All the women, the Stepford wives that is, give brilliant performances of perfect housewives so clearly inspired by the phony females in adds that they manage to give a comic edge to the story, perfectly hitting the note so it slowly increases the sense of something wrong rather than making the tone too light. Especially Ross (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, 1969) is great as the heroine, at once feisty but still insecure and self-doubting from the insanity of the situation, and Prentiss (The Parallax View, 1974) is a delight as the bubbly Bobbie just as the beautiful Louise (Day of the Outlaw, 1959) brilliantly shows the insecurity hidden underneath the beautiful face of the feisty Charmaine, while Newman (Captain Nemo and the Underwater City, 1969) delivers the perfect archetype Stepford wife persona as Carol Van Sant. One could argue that the statement against gender roles was more important in the time of the book's publishment and movie's release but considering the high standard everyone is met with in today's global life, it is as familiar a theme as ever and Bryan Forbes's (The Raging Moon, 1971) bright sunny-set movie with its gloomy secret luring underneath will still be able to hit you and hit you hard.Moviegeek.eu</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, let's just get the 'remake' starring Nicole Kidman and that other guy out of the way ? it's rubbish. Ignore it. Yes, the seventies Stepford Wives may be just a little bit dated (play 'spot the flared trousers etc), but, if you're serious about horror, then there's no comparison.If you don't know... a family move to the quiet, secluded little American town of Stepford where the man of the family joins the (secretive) 'Men's Association,' leaving the woman of the family to make friends with some of the most submissive and prim women ever. Coincidence, or something darker afoot? It's something darker, but then as it's a horror film, you probably could guess that anyway.On the off chance you haven't seen 'The Stepford Wives' I won't say too much about the plot. You'll only get the one chance to see it without knowing what happens, so I won't spoil it for you. Just know that it is a masterpiece of 'understated' horror. It doesn't need 'torture p0rn' or anything gruesome and bl00dy to scare. It's just scary in a whole different way.If I had to pick one gripe with the film, I'd say the editing is a bit choppy. Some scenes seen to cut or fade into another a bit randomly. Still, it doesn't take away from the film too much.Also, while you ignore Nicole Kidman's remake, it's probably best to ignore all the 'Stepford sequels' ? none of them are up to the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't see this 1975 film until about 20 years after its release. Even though I knew the basic plot I was quite captivated by the events of the story. Well, I've seen it three more times since then and each time I'm taken in by the storyline, not to mention well entertained.THE PLOT: Katharine Ross and her husband move to Stepford, CT, where many of the wives of the village seem to be oblivious to the current women's liberation movement; they seem wholly dedicated to their husbands, home &amp; garden and keeping themselves well-groomed and primed for sex. Meanwhile Katharine's husband joins a mysterious all-male organization which seems to be up to something fishy. When two of Katharine's friends strangely morph into the typical Stepford housewife Katharine suspects something sinister. And guess who's next in line?Paula Prentiss and Tina Louise (Ginger from Giligan's Island) are on hand as Katharine's friends.The story's not campy at all (like the 2004 version). This is serious and creepy sci-fi of the highest order. "The Stepford Wives" powerfully succeeds where the similar-themed "Westworld" only passably gets by.GRADE: A</fullReview>

Both stories are excellent BUT it seems that so many people know the twist at the end that much of the wonderful impact is lost in the movies when you see them today (or read them if you're reading "Jekyll"). I wish folks could watch this without knowing--it would make the suspense so much greater.The film begins in New York City. A family is moving to the country and once there, they see that things are practically perfect in every way. While Walter Eberhart seems to take all this perfection in stride, his wife, Joanna (Katharine Ross) is simply going bananas! Most of the housewives only talk about cleaning their homes and baking--and are very bland but beautiful women. However, there are three women (Paula Prentiss, Tina Louise and Ross) who are 'normal' and haven't succumbed to whatever's changing the women of Stepford into whatever the crap they are! This is a well made and chilling movie. If you DON'T know the twist, I'd rate it an 8 or possibly a 9. If you DO, it's still worth watching but only garners a 7. It was certainly original when it first debuted.By the way, although the movie was rated PG, today it probably would earn a PG-13 due to some sexual content and brief nudity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The female members of an exclusive bourgeois community exhibit an overly domesticated attitude in their daily life, which new arrivals from the city find more than a bit disturbing. A rather misogynist satire (based on a novel by Ira Levin and adapted here by William Goldman) whose central theme, conformism, is staunchly reflected in the slickly understated treatment; satisfactory on this level, but not exactly stimulating. Followed by three made-for-TV sequels and a disastrous remake-cum-spoof in 2004. Struggling New York photographer Katharine Ross is convinced against her will by her lawyer husband Peter Masterson to relocate to the peaceful community of Stepford; there she bonds with ditzy newcomer Paula Prentiss as she makes her incredulous way through the perfect households of obliging neighbor Nanette Newman, tennis-playing redhead Tina Louise, etc. The male community is spearheaded by calmly menacing bachelor Patrick O'Neal who heads one of the many technological companies littered throughout Stepford, not to mention its mysterious nightly "Men's Community" meetings. Although as intimated earlier the Horror and Sci-Fi elements are never unduly emphasized, the climactic revelation ? or should I say, confrontation with Ross' 'other' self ? still packs a considerable punch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Suspense, Mystery Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joanna Eberhart (Katharine Ross) has come to the quaint little town of Stepford, Connecticut with her family, but soon discovers there lies a sinister truth in the all too perfect behavior of the female residents.Written by William Goldman ("Marathon Man") from a book by Ira Levin ("Rosemary's Baby"), this story has become a modern classic, spawning three sequels and a remake. The unfortunate side effect is that for younger audiences seeing the film today for the first time, the classic twist may already be known to them. For my first viewing, I was not clear on the details, but I understood enough of the plot that it was not the shocker it could have been.Mike Mayo throws praise on the film, calling it "one of the defining works of late-20th century American horror." He acknowledges the "obvious feminist message", but also points out it features the "horror of bland comfortable suburban conformity." A similar feminist streak can be found in George Romero's "Season of the Witch" (though this is not nearly as good of a film). A film much like "Stepford Wives" but without the gender equality message is found in Wes Craven's "Invitation to Hell". Craven's film is cheesy, but altogether bad.When you compare the idea of a Stepford wife to today's "trophy wives" -- was the film ahead of its time? And do husbands really want a wife that simply looks pretty and does little else? I suppose some do, but speaking as a man who likes women, the pre-Stepford ladies were far more lovable than the new versions. Aside from a clean house and tasty dinner, why do I want a boring, monotone mate? Brian De Palma was approached to direct in early 1974, due to the surprise success of his first feature, Sisters (1973); however, negotiations fell through and he ended up filming the suspense melodrama Obsession (1976) instead. I think this might have been an even more fascinating film...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare film that it is at once entertaining and thought-provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Stepford Wives begins with Joanaa (Katherine Ross) and Walter Eberhart (Peter Masterson) taking their two daughters away from the Sodom and Gamorrah of New York City and moving to the quaint little town of Stepford. The Stepfordian wives are bizarrely perfect ? they always look put-together, they radiate pleasantness, and it would take the jaws of life to pull them away from their housework. Joanna, however, would rather be an acclaimed photographer than a tip-top housewife, and she is sharp enough to see that there is something amiss in Stepford. The writing is solid if occasionally contrived, the direction is simple yet gripping, but my favorite part of The Stepford Wives is Katherine Ross's and Paula Prentiss's performances. Ross is an appealing actress, with her big brown eyes and winning sincerity. Prentiss, who plays Joanna's pal Bobbie Markowe, is the dream best friend ? funny, friendly, positive but refreshingly honest. They both have a likable naturalness that distinguishes them from the other Stepford women, and their chemistry makes for one of the most believable girlfrienships I've seen on screen. What's more, there's a womanliness to both of them that makes the film interesting. They are at once too feminine to become militant feminists, but too bright and lively to wear lace aprons and discuss laundry detergents. It adds another layer of ambivalence to a film rife with female dilemmas ? Can I be myself and still please my husband? Can I follow my own dreams and still fulfill my responsibilities to my family? The idea of suburbia as a prison has become a film clich, seen also in Revolution Road and the television series Desperate Housewives. I don't think it's na?ve to say that American women have made significant progress since 1975. In 2010, we have women serving major positions in each of the three branches of government. A woman recently won an Oscar for directing an action film. As women rise in power and become more active in the workforce, The Stepford Wives becomes more archaic. The questions it raises, however, are still poignant. It's a science fiction treatment of the classic Pygmalion tale.</fullReview>

It has great pacing to create a realistic story where you are really drawn in, in an authentic way (unlike a lot of modern Hollywood movies). The dialogue is so natural that its almost distracting in that you're wondering how someone wrote such a realistic script (at least I was). The original Stepford Wives has amazing mood transitions, too, without disrupting your suspended disbelief. The best friend in the movie kind of stole the show, but the main character did an amazing job as well. It's science fiction, I guess, but the point of the movie is the characters, and to some extent the plot, but not the premise -- and yet that's what the movie is known for! Anyway, great movie, really good, and I'd recommend it to anyone who has an appreciation for the eerie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Bobbie, it's gotten to YOU now!" This is one of my most favorite quotes from the film, though I have a great many. This is one of the most quotable films I've ever seen. My "Stepford" facts:When this film debuted in 1975, I was 13 and my older sister was 18. We were going to go see this movie in the theater but never did. Regrettably, I have never seen it on the big screen.For years, even after the advent of VCR's, it was not available on video. So one night, I was able to tape it off channel 5, our local CBS affiliate here in San Francisco. Parts were edited out I wasn't aware of. So the ending came as a surprise when I eventually saw the uncut film and saw more than I had ever seen before in the next to final scene of the film. **Possible spoilers ahead** Though it's very implausible, it has always been and still is one of my most favorite films. It's very helpful to read the book first as it references things from the book that make more sense if you've read the book ("she'll be...like one of those robots in Disneyland" .."when I cut myself, I bleed!") but changes some things to good effect. That is to say, both have strengths. I've always loved Katharine Ross (The Graduate, Butch Cassidy) and she is great as Joanna, but Paula Prentiss should have gotten the Academy Award for her (vegetable cutting) scene (Why look at YOU for heaven's sakes!)in the kitchen with Joanna. In fact, both were quite good in that scene. The underlying subtle feel of science fiction is palpable in that scene and what follows. It's arguably my most favorite scene in the movie. Tina Louise ("Ginger" from Gilligan's Island) is great as Charmaine, in what might be an under-appreciated character role from the book. In fact, the entire supporting cast of women is great. They all do the roles of the various wives very well. Even the bit parts such as the psychiatrist and the chemist who checks the water are well cast and well acted. The magic is marred somewhat by moments of bad dialogue and in particular, I wish they had done the psychiatrist's office scene a bit differently. Still, it's a minor gripe. I love the music (and sound effects) in this film. It fits absolutely perfectly with the scenes and the final music playing over the closing credits is melancholy and wistful and very fitting. Unfortunately, there seems to be no soundtrack CD available. **Possible spoilers ahead** I wish to add two other things to this review several years after I wrote it. One thing that has been commented on is why the men didn't take photos of the wives instead of an artist doing sketches. This is an idea from the novel that could not be duplicated on screen, i.e., in the novel, the artist Ike Mazzard is famous for drawing very flattering sketches. What he draws is much more beautiful than the woman is in real life. That would be hard to re- create on film without coming off silly. So what director Forbes had to do was cast women who were already pretty attractive and they are, don't you think? Another question that has nagged me, how do these men create these women servants who are so skilled, they can bake and cook so well, etc.? As a skilled baker myself, these men strike me as being so ignorant of knowing their way around a kitchen, I'm not sure they would know how to boil water for spaghetti, let alone turn out a beautiful batch of brownies. "I know I shouldn't say this, but I...just...love...my...brownies!" (Can't resist using Kit's line from the movie). Still, credit goes to Ira Levin for duplicating well his theme from Rosemary's Baby, that of a woman alone in surroundings that seem to have something sinister going on and closing in on HER, only here he transferred it to the suburbs, and to great effect. When Joanna realizes her best friend Bobbie isn't really Bobbie anymore, the real horror sets in. She knows she is utterly alone and may not escape Stepford. It builds to the very eerie climax at the Men's Association building. Patrick O'Neal is chillingly evil in a very matter of fact way as Dale Coba or "Diz". In many ways, it is a powerful statement against technology and how it is pervasive and taking over our lives. And this was the mid seventies! It's also a savage social commentary on the conformity of upper middle class suburbia and the powerful hold that tradition can have on a community, in this case the fictional Stepford (as in "Steeped in Tradition") Village in old New England. (The sign that greets them, "Welcome to Stepford Village") and it predates the yuppie era. A very cool sci fi idea, brought to life on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't, and don't even want to, say too much about Stepford Wives -- I don't want to spoil it for you -- except that it is a pretty perfect movie: intelligent, full of suspense, subtle, entertaining, thought-provoking, innovative, well acted. I guess they just don't make 'em like that anymore. And in contrast to a myriad of movies trying to make a political statement, Stepford Wives is political and entertaining at the same time.By marked contrast, the 2004 remake with Nicole Kidman and Matthew Broderick is just bland, boring, drawing by numbers. I actually saw the remake first, and the political statement is so obvious that it never touches you emotionally, it's like reading a student manifesto. Yeah, yeah, women should be allowed to have a personality, bravo. It's a Stepford Movie, it does exactly what is expected of it, it looks good and glossy, and is utterly forgettable. Go see the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie popped up on Australian TV a couple of weeks ago. I naturally had heard about The Sepford Wives, but had not seen it before. It's a truly disturbingly creepy movie. The second to last scene sent shivers down my spine, and im not easily rattled. I've seen all the so called horror films, The Exorcist, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Halloween movies, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory ? seen them all.Its starts off incredibly slow with Joanna (Katherine Ross) and husband Walter and their two kids moving to a town called Stepford, then it almost grinds to a halt when Joanna wants to start a woman's group, (the only reason I kept watching is because of the wonderful Paula Prentiss shows up) most of the wives aren't keen on joining, preferring to bake and clean and pretending they are enjoying sex with their husbands. To cut a long story short - turns out that most of the Stepford wives are robots!THE BAD BITSI think this is a great movie but plot wise is really flawed, for instanceWhen the old guy was sketching Joanna, HEY Sherlock why not take some photos. Joanna stabs Bobbie in the guts to see if she bleeds, why not just prick her finger. What possible motivation would those men have to murder their wives and yet have robots made to look like them.THE GOOD BITSPaula Prentiss ? an underrated actress.Tina Louise ? great legs, you had your chance Gilligan. The second to last scene, that mock up of Joanna's room when just before Dale Coba said "we weren't ready for you yet" thus the eyes weren't ready yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, Satirical, Gripping Thriller About Domestic Bliss In Small-Town America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joanna Eberhart moves with her husband and two children to the picturesque Connecticut village of Stepford to escape the grime and crime of New York. But she misses her old life and finds Stepford dull and superficial. The women act like TV commercial dolly-birds, whose only desire is to be pretty, fit in and support their families. Where is their individuality, and what do all the men do all night at their mysterious club ?Like a lot of movies with a killer twist, some people say that once you know the gag in this movie then it's not worth seeing. That completely misses the point. The plot is gripping (and wisely doesn't explain itself too much) but it's the social comment that's particularly incisive and interesting. Most women have to force themselves not to be defined by their relationships to others, and are expected to adhere to the role of glamorous, non-presumptive cook-cleaner-lover-nursemaid without complaint; the movie is a funny, scary, crafty examination of that role taken to the most ludicrous extreme, crystallised when Joanna says, "When you come back there'll be a woman with my name and my face, she'll cook and clean like crazy, but she won't take pictures and she won't be me !". What I find particularly interesting about this is that the male fantasy of what women should be - based on some fifties ideal that never existed - is as prevalent as ever today. Check out the girls section of any toy store and there's nothing but endless rows of pink, ultra-feminised tat. Look at female singers on MTV or women in commercials and they are almost all portrayed as sex objects with nothing to say but look how alluring I am. TV is full of crappy reality shows telling women how to make their home look nicer or how to cook better. Where are the angry broads shouting about this, as there were in the sixties and seventies ? In short, this is a very rich theme, more so now than ever. Technically, the film is terrific; Owen Roizman's photography is a finely-judged mixture of the bland sheen of Stepford's appearance and the dark underbelly of its secrets, with the final scene in the supermarket particularly memorable. The good-but-not-great cast are enjoyable - the show-stealer is Prentiss who is hilarious as the lovably screwy Bobbie; when a statuesque blonde asks her which of two sweet-looking flowers she prefers, her cheerful response is, "Erm, I don't think either one.". Look fast for Dee Wallace as a German maid. Scripted by uber-screenwriter William Goldman and based on a brilliant book by Ira Levin (who also wrote Rosemary's Baby and The Boys From Brazil), and remade as a more overtly comic piece by Frank Oz in 2004. Trivia - Masterson's daughter Mary Stewart - a very successful adult actress, particularly in the nineties - plays one his two children, and Newman (famous here in the UK for selling washing-up liquid on TV would you believe) is the wife of Forbes. A great film about women, made by men.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Stepford Wives' is a daylight horror movie with a rather banal topic. The wives that live in Stepford have been selected to be victims of a very extraordinary scheme by their husbands. That something is going on is revealed piece by piece and still many things are left without a proper answer. It could be that the movie is asking these little questions from the viewer and never replies them by itself.It is noteworthy that you can watch this film quite a many times and not get bored with it. It is relatively long one but you just got to watch it to the end. You'll get conscious that it has a little bit of feminist propaganda there as well but it is not actually annoying to male viewer at all. It's all about a thing all women (probably) are afraid of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For one thing, I'm not sure which version I like best - this is real apples and oranges time. In the summer of 2004, I was trying to make time to see the Nicole / Bette parody of the movie (YES, you read right - a PARODY) - missed it - I was an idiot for not taking two lousy hours to drive down to the cinema. But, anyway, I bought the 1975 version on DVD and was kind of disappointed in it at first, feeling it to be a bit slow moving (I AM an American, we like our stuff fast-paced and in-the-face) but I couldn't get it out of my mind and I kept going back and forth with SCENE SELECTION until, by God, it ended up as one of my favorite movies, ever. The creepy husband, I was highly amused to discover, is the creepy first doctor in "The Exorcist" ("YOU KEEP DRUGS IN YOUR HOUSE?"). Joanna seems sad, resigned, and with those huge, expressive eyes of hers, seems to always look outward, always out for something better. Then along came Paula. God, I love Paula Prentiss - why aren't she and Katharine acting more often today? Frank Oz, of the new one, wanted to film cameos with them, but decided against the idea - he didn't want to take away from the story.The storyline of the 1975 film can be seen from various angles - as a satire on the perfect marriage, and also, if you will, fundamentalist Christianity, the corporate workplace, school, you name it, every aspect of life demands a form of submission and conformity or else there will be negative consequences. You're suspended and subsequently fired for dressing a certain way and for being too outgoing, etc. You're beaten by teachers in school, you're ridiculed and otherwise ostracized by peers in school, and, for that matter, some co-workers. When Joanna sees Bobbie changed and just cannot get through to her at all, it reminded me of several times in life when I saw a friend had taken on a major change - marriage in the burbs, religious conversion, etc. Hell, I even took EST and there was the occasional person I could relate to, my own "Bobbie" - then they CHANGED and I just wanted to run out of the room, screaming.Oh, yeah, this film is the perfect illustration of that horrific aspect of life. So much for live and let live.As for the 2004 version, after the dark cinematography and the chilling easy listening music, it was great to take a breath, kick back and just laugh at it all, with the orchestral bombast, teletubbies gone berserk and ominous hellish choirs. That's another aspect of life - to be stirred, scared, disturbed by something in 1975, and to laugh in its face as a way to deal with it all. Great companion pieces for each other - they both get a "10".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A case of myth-taken identity...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(((((SPOILERS))))) As is, THE STEPFORD WIVES is a tidy little sci-fi thriller, given a neat satiric twist because it is set against the sunny backdrop of upscale suburbia. It has also gained the reputation of being feminist in nature, especially by those who see women as victims. I don't necessarily agree. THE STEPFORD WIVES can be approached on several different fronts, most famously, I suppose, as a feminist essay; sort of a worst-of-all-possible-cases scenario of female oppression. On that level, the film is rather simplistic, summing up gender politics of female vs. male on the most extreme level: women being suppressed to the point of extinction by a male society that literally sees women as objects, sexual and otherwise. On this level, the film's gender politics are so pat and cold-blooded as to be ridiculous. It only works if you view it as a comedy mocking such feminist extremist views. I mean, only in delusional feminism would there exist an average man who would actually prefer a Stepford Wife. The film really can't be seen as anti-male because it lacks that grain of truth that men would desire or even accept a mechanized one-size-fits-all companion and lover. The Stepford Wife is a fantasy figure; but then so is the Stepford Husband.The film fails to create a convincing male as villain concept because the vision of The Stepford Wife is not a male's vision of a perfect woman. Indeed, The Stepford Wife is a female vision of feminine perfection born out of the pages of "Cosmopolitan," "Ladies Home Journal" and "Redbook" and from images found in TV commercials. Though feminists would claim that such images cater to a male sensibility, these images are for and by women who want to perpetuate notions that are already acceptable to women. Very few men would see the June Cleaver stereotype of passive subserviency as the perfect woman. Rather, most men, I think, would seek a playmate, both in the Playboy sense of the word and in the playground sense; that is a woman who is sexual provocative, yet actively in tune with a man's interests. Someone who shares life; a woman who is not afraid to be one of the boys. A friend, not a servant. I think most men would find the Stepford prototype of a woman mindlessly concerned with recipes and cleaning tips to be extremely boring -- just as feminist do. In short, THE STEPFORD WIVES' vision of the malevolent male is so devoid of truth that, as a man, I simply can't take it seriously enough to be insulted. Yet, a more contrary reading of the film could interpret it as a feminist nightmare, wherein men aren't the villains, but feminist evolution is. Women in the film become the victims of a progressive, if extreme form of consumerism that is rendering the concept of woman obsolete. In a society that is largely engineered to cater to female consumerism with products that lessen or eliminate so-called "women's work," the film suggests that the ultimate result would be to replace the woman herself. If, for instance, loving and supporting a husband is deemed as much of a chore as scrubbing the floor or doing the laundry, then might machines be capable of filling the need as well? The film could be interpreted as being anti-feminist, since it is feminist ideology, not tradition, that suggests the conventional roles of women -- lover, wife, mother, caregiver -- are dull and routine roles that render women as being little more than soulless machines. It is feminists who have redefined and devalued the role of the housewife. The Stepford Wife fulfills a perverse feminist fantasy, not a male sexist fantasy. Also, it has been the basis of some extreme feminist rants that men are becoming obsolete as women liberate themselves, arguing that science (i.e., sperm banks and the like) can supply women with all they really need from men. So, might creating a liberated male society free of actual women be seen as throwing such theoretical musings back into the feminists' collective face? THE STEPFORD WIVES shows how ludicrous the no-man's-land vision of feminist utopia is by illustrating the mirror image, a no woman's land. To paraphrase Gloria Steinem, does a man need a woman like a fish needs a bicycle? That seems to be a question in STEPFORD.As such, is THE STEPFORD WIVES an alarmist feminist analogy of what men are doing to women, or a satirical nightmare vision of what women are doing to themselves? Either way, the ultimate demon in THE STEPFORD WIVES is the fear of conformity, be it the outgrowth of consumerism, community or marriage itself. But, to some extent, isn't conformity what binds any group together, including the feminists?The perversity of THE STEPFORD WIVES is that its basic ideology is wrong in the first place. The feminist notion that marriage equals sexual/gender slavery has never taken hold because marriage often means just the opposite: a woman who "marries well" is more likely to gain freedom, certainly financially. While men are fully expected to be breadwinners, even in our world of the two-income family, work, as often as not, remains an option for a married woman. Even a working wife has greater freedom to change or leave jobs, if she can rely on the safety net of a working husband. In fact, it is men for whom marriage curtails freedom and demands conformity, as their flexibility for professional, social and sexual freedom greatly decreases or even disappears entirely. Marriage remains, even in a post-feminist world, a largely female institution; a way of civilizing the male for the benefit of the female. But, having said all this, I think the best way to view THE STEPFORD WIVES is as yet another variation of man's pursuit of perfection. As a twisted mix of MY FAIR LADY and FRANKENSTEIN, the film suggests that socially or scientifically we try to create perfection in others, even if we can't create it in ourselves. But perfection is a myth, and so is a Stepford Wife.</fullReview>

Katharine Ross and Paula Prentiss give convincing performances as two modern women of the Seventies baffled by their new surroundings. Tina Louise was wonderful as Charmaine, very convincing as the bored trophy wife turned Stepford wife. The movie is disturbing in that the look of it goes back and forth from being a Wella Balsam shampoo commercial of the seventies to an episode of the Twilight Zone. A movie that could only be made at that point in time, the height of the womens lib movement. Because of that, the Stepford Wives works!! It makes me so sad their are plans to remake this as a modern day farce or joke filled comedy, with Nicole Kidman supposedly starring.</fullReview>

There's a scene where Charmaine's husband is driving away from the club, and another guy offers to drive. Hubby is sweating, and distressed, but the other guy convinces him that this is for the best. It kind of also explains why Joanne's husband is getting drunk when her turn has come. They initially don't want to, but being the weak, followers that they are, they all go along with it. I got that impression when I first saw it back when it was new.I agree that it isn't a 'great' film, but it quietly presses enough buttons, and it is fun to watch. And it's funny how many people know it. I'm a guy, and sometimes when I'm at a cookout, I'll go around to people saying, "I'll just die if I don't get this recipe." A few people will get it 1st time, but it doesn't take more than three times before they recognize it!Just one fun film, and one that I'll probably watch again when it comes on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chiller way ahead of its time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1975's "The Stepford Wives" is a modest, at times genteel, but still very effective thriller rooted in many of the cause celebre's of the '60's and the 70's. Everything from woman's lib, equality of the sexes, to just plain old government fascism are explored here. It also paved the way for such similarly themed films as "The Matrix", and "The Truman Show".The film is based on Ira Levin's best-seller, which has its fair share of "Rosemary's Baby" overtones. She plays Joanna; a fashion photographer who with her lawyer husband (Peter Masterson), take their two kids and their dog up to Stepford, Connecticut. Upon arriving, the setting is perfect and idyllic; a little too perfect for Joanna's taste. Not only do they leave their doors unlocked (particularly bad when intruders peer in on your "doing the nasty"), but the housewives actually enjoy doing housework! They all come off as "Proctor &amp; Gamble" spokesperson rejects. Their husbands don't seem to mind, but it raises Joanna's suspicions. Not only her, but her friend Bobbie's (Paula Prentiss) as well.What is going on? Is it something in the water, or do the men have some sort of Masonic club where they conjure up these horror scenarios? The end result is both terrifying as well as topical. The film is wise to keep everything hinted and never overt, thanks to William Goldman's ("Butch Cassidy &amp; the Sundance Kid; Misery) subtle wit and intelligent dialogue.My one disappointment is that today's thrillers focus far too much on computer technology and gore and not enough on character and narrative. Case in point, the remake of "13 Ghosts". Let's hope no one even remotely attempts to remake this doozy of a chiller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story follows Joanna Eberhart, an avid shutterbug, who has recently moved with her family from New York City to the town of Stepford, Connecticut. As the movie progresses, Joanna notices the other women she meets in town seem to have few interests outside of housework, and aren't particularly interested in the "womens' lib" movement like Joanna is. Joanna eventually makes friends with two women, Charmaine Wimperis and Bobbi Markowe, also recent transplants to Stepford with lively personalities. However as time goes on, both Bobbi and Charmaine seemingly change overnight, losing interest in anything but housework. This leads Joanna to panic, despite her husband's reassurances, and it becomes a race against time before Joanna learns what the real secret of Stepford is.While the film is something of a time capsule to the paranoia of the 1970s, there is some great acting and wonderful social commentary. At times the movie moves too slowly, but it makes up for it with an action packed ending, and an incredibly creepy scene between Joanna and Bobbi where Joanna learns what really caused Bobbi to change.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many '70's pictures ( 'The Taking Of Pelham One-Two-Three', 'The Wicker Man', and 'Get Carter' ), 'The Stepford Wives' has had its reputation recently sullied by an inferior remake, in this case Frank Oz's 2004 version starring Nicole Kidman and Bette Midler, which unwisely treated Ira Levin's thought provoking, suspense story as a fun romp. The book came out at the height of the feminist movement, as more and more women ( mainly American ) began deserting their kitchens and asserting their individuality. Like the author's earlier 'Rosemary Baby', the story also focuses on a young married couple moving to a new neighbourhood where everything is not as it seems. Walter Eberhart ( Peter Masterson ) and wife Joanna ( Katherine Ross ) leave the hustle and bustle of New York for the more sedate Stepford, a town where both the crime rate and taxes are low. She begins noticing a curious phenomenon; local women are gradually losing their personalities, becoming mindless automatons whose only function in life is cooking, cleaning, and keeping their menfolk happy in bed. Her husband joins the local Men's Association - of which every man in the community is a member - run by the creepy Dale Coba ( Patrick O'Neal ), nicknamed 'Dis' because he used to work in Disneyland. Joanna teams up with Bobbie Markowe ( Paula Prentiss ) and they try to get to the bottom of the mystery. The truth is too horrifying for words...Directed by Britisher Bryan Forbes and scripted by William Goldman, 'Stepford Wives' is an engrossing and intelligent movie, the antithesis of Oz's fiasco. The men in Stepford are so scared of feminism they have resorted to quietly killing their wives and replacing them with perfect robot doubles. When Joanna asks Dis why he is doing all this, he replies: "Because we can!". Like the 'Westworld' androids, the Stepford Wives are capable of sexual intercourse.Katherine Ross shot to fame in Mike Nichols 'The Graduate' ( 1967 ) and then appeared as 'Etta Place' in 'Butch Cassidy &amp; The Sundance Kid' ( 1969 ). Sadly, her film career never recovered after appearing in Irwin Allen's abysmal 'The Swarm' ( 1976 ). As the enquiring 'Joanna', she is superb, with kooky Paula Prentiss equally impressive as her loud friend Bobbie. Unfortunately, Forbes was unable to resist the temptation of putting wife Nanette Newman in a key role. Goldman's original conception for the Wives was that they all look like Playboy models. But with Newman around, the idea had to be dropped ( even in 1975 she was too mature to convincingly pass for a Raquel Welch type ), hence they are seen pushing trolleys round supermarkets whilst wearing big, floppy hats and long, flowing dresses rather than reclining on beaches in skimpy bikinis. As Goldman pointed out in his book 'Adventures In The Screen Trade', it you are going to spend the rest of your life humping a piece of plastic, it had better be in the shape of Bo Derek, not Nanette Newman. So Forbes' film is flawed, but still worth seeing.Though it performed poorly at the box office, it went on to become a cult classic, inspiring a pair of made-for-television sequels - 'The Revenge Of The Stepford Wives' ( 1979 ) and - if you can believe this - ''The Stepford Children' ( 1987 ). Unlike the remake which copped out by turning Diz's robots into brainwashed women ( thereby justifying an absurd, tacked-on happy ending ), the original ends on a downbeat note, and is better for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Thriller in Sunlight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joanna Eberhart moves with her husband Walter and two children from New York to the small Connecticut town of Stepford. Walter loves life in the town, but Joanna finds herself becoming bored and lonely. She tries to befriend the other women in the town, but finds most of them dull, obsessed with housework to the exclusion of all else with few intellectual interests. The one exception is the outgoing Bobbie Markowe who quickly becomes Joanna's one close friend.Joanna begins to suspect that something sinister is going on in the town and that that something is connected to the town's Men's Association, to which most of the male inhabitants, including Walter, belong. Joanna's suspicions are strengthened when Bobbie, hitherto irreverent and free-thinking, begins to behave in the same way as the other wives. Whereas she previously dressed informally in jeans and a shirt, she now adopts a more feminine style, starts to behave submissively towards her husband and can talk of nothing but cooking and cleaning. At this point I assumed that the denouement would turn out to be that the women were being drugged or hypnotised into subservience by their husbands. The truth, however, is even more horrifying.In format "The Stepford Wives" is a thriller with science fiction elements, but there are several features which set it apart from run-of-the-mill thrillers. One is its visual style, very different from the dark, claustrophobic look of most thrillers. In "North by North-West" Alfred Hitchcock posed himself a challenge to his own ingenuity by setting the film's most famous suspense sequence, the one in which Cary Grant is chased by the crop-duster plane, in broad daylight on a flat, open prairie. Here Bryan Forbes takes that concept a stage further, challenging his own ingenuity not just during one sequence but throughout the entire film, making what he called a "thriller in sunlight".Stepford is sometimes described as a "suburb", because it is close enough to new York for the men to commute into the city, but in appearance it is closer to the picture-postcard New England village with white wooden houses and verdant countryside surrounding it. The look of the film is light cheerful, with a palette dominated by white and bright colours. The uniform of the "Stepford Wife" (surprisingly stylish given that we are talking about the seventies, the Decade that Taste Forgot) consists of long, flowing Laura Ashley style dresses and big hats. Only in the finale do darker tones predominate.The other feature which distinguishes this film from other thrillers is the lack of the traditional happy ending with the heroine safe and the villains punished for their villainy. This is one thriller where the bad guys win. By the end of the film all the wives, including Joanna, have been murdered and replaced by lookalike robots.This ending was, of course, quite deliberate. The film was made in the mid-seventies, during the heyday of feminism, and was intended as a satire on sexism (or "male chauvinism", to use the contemporary vocabulary). The main target was the traditional male view of married women as decorative, sexually submissive, domestic goddesses. A woman confined to the domestic sphere might just as well be a robotic slave. The film's success in getting its message across can be judged from the fact that the concept of a Stepford Wife has passed into popular culture to denote a woman who thinks of little other than her home and family. Had the film ended happily, it would have seemed less chilling and its satirical point would have been weakened. Frank Oz seemed to miss this point when in 2004 he remade the film as a comedy complete with happy ending.William Goldman's original screenplay had a rather different concept of a Stepford Wife; the women were portrayed not as idealised housewives but as sexy model-girl types, dressed scantily like Playboy bunnies. This concept was changed when Forbes cast his wife Nanette Newman as one of Joanna's robotised neighbours; apparently Goldman did not see Nanette as a Bunny Girl. I think that this change was for the better. In 1975 the film worked better as a satire on traditional, conservative male attitudes to women than it would have done as a satire on Playboy-style permissiveness, although, paradoxically, with changing social attitudes Goldman's original concept might have worked better in 2004. Unfortunately, Oz does not seem to have considered this option.The film was not a great success in 1975, but over the years it has acquired a reputation as a cult film. It is not a great film; there are no really outstanding acting contributions, except perhaps Newman's brief cameo. ("I'll just die if I don't get that recipe"). The satire is at time a bit heavy-handed; with all due respect to Mr Goldman, I doubt if even genuine housewives would have been very enthusiastic about the "consciousness raising session" which Joanna and Bobbie try to organise. Nevertheless, the originality of the concept and Forbes' skillful handling of the direction make this a film of great interest. Forget that dreadful remake. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the kind of movie that you like to rewatch everyone once in a while and revel in the eerieness. I enjoyed it when it was first released and I still enjoy it.Why?Because the movie operates on several levels. There are the obvious themes of:Male ChauvinismAnti-feminismScience FictionConspiracyThen there are the other themes of:ControlFraternal ComraderySecret SocietiesSex vs. LoveAlienationUpper-Middle Class Immunity from CulpabilityOrder vs. DisorderTotalitarian SubordinationEach of these themes is depicted with a careful subtlety that gets under your skin to make a whole that enchants with its dread.We are never told exactly how the changes come about. I won't spoil it for those who have never seen this movie. But I feel that in a story such as this, an explanation of the mechanics are not always necessary. What is important is the themes have been presented and presented as eloquently as this movie has.Though the central character is played by Katherine Ross (and quite well I might add), my favorite character is that one played by Paula Prentiss. I consider it an enormous loss that we have not seen more of her in the past 20 years. She has always exuded a disarming and engaging "likeability" that strikes a chord with me. She allows us to like her, she's approachable as a close friend would be.Back to the movie, I challenge the remakers of this film to supply us with as much fascinating social commentary as the original. I suspect that we're going to be treated to a techno-screwball comedy. It would be a shame if that were true. We shall see.I hope the darkness and mystery of this original remains. But with the recent crop of disappointing remakes from the "whatever" generation that is hell-bent on less and less storytelling and more technicality and vulgarity, I just don't see it.Stepford Wives (1975) is a wonderful movie. I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Domestic bliss for wives in Stepford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Stepford Wives was a huge disappointment. I expected something much more riveting. Rosemary's Baby, also based on another Ira Levin book, was far better. This one dragged from start to finish. Even accomplished actors Katharine Ross and Paula Prentiss couldn't rescue this slow motion movie. I'm not saying that this isn't an interesting period piece. Made in the early 1970's it shows the disquiet of young, educated women about marriage and becoming a domestic robot. Many women of the time expressed the need to avoid becoming kitchen queens, keeping a perfect house and being sexually attractive. Some of the dialogue makes this very clear in a humorous and mocking way. Some of the scenes of the women are quite pointed. For example, conversations about domestic cleaning solutions at a serious meeting where Katharine Ross and Paula Prentiss try to encourage some awareness raising about the emptiness of their lives. The supermarket scene of the wives dressed like domestic sex goddesses was like fodder for the college crowd in 1975. There is some over the top drama where Katharine Ross tries take a stand against the town's conspiracy to make all families into robotic commercial style icons of the advertising world. Clearly the movie had points to make but lacked coherence and was marred by an overlong and far fetched story that wouldn't connect with the audience then or now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Eye-Opener for a 17 Year Old</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw The Stepford Wives, it was on ABC, in, I think, the fall of 1975. Since then, I've seen TSW about a half dozen times, and I still am amazed at how unsettling this sci-fi/feminist Gothic can be. I don't think of myself as a feminist--the levels of anger and hostility are a turn-off--but I got the point of the movie. Stepford is a grown-ups' movie because it has the audacity to tell an uncomfortable story, one of possessiveness and mass-murder in a sleepy New England community. The futuristic technology in the movie was dated for a long while, but with the advent of that Scarlett Johansson robot in the news, the end scene in TSW seems eerily prescient. In my childhood, I expected the good guys--or in this case, the heroine--to win. I won't give anything away, but the ending of The Stepford Wives is easy to see coming as an almost senior-citizen, but as a high school senior, I was stunned at how the story ends.Some years ago I read the Ira Levin novel. There is a moment in the book that, if I had been a 17 year old, I would have found incomprehensible. The main character and her husband are drifting away from each other, and, one night, the husband starts masturbating in bed while his wife, who he thinks is asleep, is very much awake. She lays still with her back to him. He is crying while he's manipulating himself, and she's horrified but silent.Here is his wife, 6 inches away from him, but the distance could easily be 6 miles. They're no longer married. She's dead to him. Heavy stuff, dude.Johanna Eberhart's husband, Walter, holds a secret so monstrous, his wife's horror at his self-gratification would quickly vanish if she knew her fate.So, when I sat down to watch the movie again some 10 years ago, I was startled at how deeply disturbing the book was and how the movie almost gets it right. The cast is both acceptable and believable, and my only quibble is that, as things wrap up, The Stepford Wives starts to veer dangerously close to a clichd mad slasher flick. And that's my only complaint. My favorite moment in the movie is when one of Katherine Ross' friends, I think it was Tina Louise, mocks suburban wifey-wifeness by sneering through cigarette smoke, "Personally, I'd rather not squeeze the goddamned Charmin." That line is my take-away from this well-made, unpleasant, and disturbing little horror flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film charged, indirectly, to the invasion of technology and chemicals to be creating new -adaptables- human beings. This was thought in 1975. Today -2015- the discussion is virtually closed : the technological dictatorship and large laboratories already have created a new customizable humanity. Not only that discussion is closed: also the "liberating weapon" -embodied in the film by the intervention of a psychoanalyst- is prohibited (no university in the world has courses on Freudian psychoanalysis). Unfortunately, the film ends poorly, avoiding giving these ideas to the public.I wonder if the director Bryan Forbes or the film's producers were afraid to express these ideas clearly. Anyway this is the best version of the three that have been made (not even worth mentioning "The Stepford Children" ... a horrific stupidity).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do miss the satirical cheek of Ira Levin's novel, but William Goldman's script for "The Stepford Wives" works pretty well as a straight psychological horror movie. The idyllic setting of Stepford, CT gives way to paranoia and despair as the town's wives -one by one- become automatons of domesticity, spouting TV commercial bromides about household products. Beautiful and subservient. And what this movie does well is ratchet up the creepy, especially at film's end.But the movie takes it sweet time getting to that unnerving end (damn, those black shark eyes!), and the path there to is subdued to say the least. "The Stepford Wives" leaves its mark, but I don't feel the need to see it again in the near future.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joanna Eberhardt (Katharine Ross) and husband Walter (Peter Masterson) move their family from Manhattan to a quiet suburb called Stepford. All of the wives there seem to be completely subservient to their husbands. Before long, Joanna begins to suspect there may be more to the housewives' behavior than meets the eye. She also wonders if the mysterious Men's Association, of which her husband is the newest member, is behind it all.I liked this movie a lot more than I expected to. I've read before that the film was too slow but I enjoyed the pacing. I went into this knowing, more or less, what the plot was all about so I wasn't surprised by much. Still it was an enjoyable "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" type of thriller with some sci-fi elements and dark humor. The cast is good. Ross isn't a favorite of mine but she's fine here. Paula Prentiss is the standout, however. Her effortless and charismatic performance as the Ethel to Katharine Ross' Lucy helped soften the somewhat icy Ross. Tina Louise is also in it and enjoyable. The only real fault casting-wise is Nanette Newman, wife of the director. She doesn't seem the right fit for her part. But otherwise the movie has a solid cast. It's an entertaining film. It obviously has some subtext to it that many will find interesting to chew on. Whether you're one of them or not, it's got enough going for it to make for an enjoyable straightforward viewing experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1975, while Feminists were Roaring about their new found Freedom there was and still is some Pushback (ever listen to Rush Limbaugh) about a Woman's Place, and some may still Think that they should be put and kept in Their Place. But when this Movie was made it was the beginning of the Rage Against the Male. Everyone by now must know the Punch Line to this Creepy and Relevant Story and that may limit some of the Visceral Reaction to viewing it for the first time Today.But it remains a Classic and rightfully so. It's pace is very Laid-Back and Suburbanite but that Rhythm is never without a Disturbing Edge surrounding this Horrific Satire. The Final Act is Fittingly Unsettling but does seem somewhat Restrained. The Final Scene is Legendary.Overall, the Movie has lost a bit of its Impact but not its Contemplation Factor. Like all Good Sci-Fi, the Story is still being Remade to this Day in one way or another and the Premise is as Thought Provoking as ever. The Cast does a good Job and the Script is very Natural, with Dialog at times so Convincing it seems Ad-Libbed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stepford Wives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find that the Stepford Wives isn't exactly a work of the greatest art but it is enticing. Something homey about it that soon turns a little unsettling. Still it's really an intelligent movie. It was made in 1975 and to me, Automation, Electronics and Technology wasn't so equipped to have these "Robots" made as they were. It kind of seems flip flopped in that area, as if the science to create such a society wasn't invented yet. I like Katherine Ross role because she is observant, her first observation being that the "ambulance" that drove the lady in the car accident away, didn't go towards to Hospital. The presence of all of those plants that allude to computers and electronics being part of the formula and the fact that Patrick O'Neil worked for Disneyland at one point could account for his knowledge of Robots (I guess) or the man who had Katherine voice recording and the Artist. I never engaged in it years ago but recently have gotten hooked on this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard about the Nicole Kidman film, I assumed it was a TV show based film, but then I saw that there was this original, from director Bryan Forbes (The L-Shaped Room). Basically Joanna Eberhart (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid's Katharine Ross) with husband Walter (Peter Masterson) and the children have moved to the calm suburbs of Stepford, Connecticut, Massachussets from Manhattan. Joanna wants to be remembered as a successful photographer, but inadequate Walter has joined the mysterious Men's Club, taking place in a guarded old manor house. Joanna, with new friend Bobbie Markowe (Paula Prentiss) are suspicious of all the wives in Stepford, being all perfect, dressing in flowery dresses and loving their housework. Joanna and Bobby think that it's something in the water, after hearing of some sort of pollution spread, but the truth is much more creepy than that. After seeing Bobby become part of it, it is revealed that the men of Stepford have been replacing their wives with domestic sex robots, and the horrible ending has Joanna becoming one too, all hanging out in the supermarket being controlled to be smiley and friendly. Also starring Nanette Newman as Carol Van Sant, Patrick O'Neal as Dale Coba, Tina Louise as Charmaine Wimpiris, Carol Eve Rossen as Dr. Fancher and William Prince as artist Ike Mazzard. Simon Cowell made a quote about a contestant on The X Factor being like one of the wives, I can see absolutely what he means - she never stopped smiling. The performances by Ross and the animatronically changed women make this a very creepy science-fiction thriller, the slogan could be, be careful what you marry, lol. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give this a high rating only because I recently watched the horrid remake put out by Dreamworks.I have to say some of the elements of this film are quite dated. From bra less women (there's a fad that didn't last long) to station wagons to rotary phones, this film screams "1970's".We all know the plot here. A liberated woman moves to Stepford, CT, only to find the other wives are content to live the life of suburban servitude and give up their individuality. The heroine struggles against this until she realizes the horrible truth about an hour and a half after the audience has figured it out, that these women are being replaced by robots.In many ways, this film reflected our two biggest fears in the 1970's. That a) feminism was destroying the beloved American way of life and 2) we could all be replaced by machines. I think by and large, we've gotten over both, as we've learned to live with liberated women (who thankfully, in most cases, still wear bras) and computers.Still, the film has its merits. The character of "Diz" is much scarier than any hockey-mask wearing denizen of a modern horror film without the special effects and unrelenting gore. The heroines played by Katherine Ross and Paula Prentiss are sympathetic (unlike the Nicole Kidman and Bette Midler characters in the awful remake).To a degree, the film holds up despite its dated elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stepford - Where Men are Men and Women are Made of Plastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My God - to think that I was disappointed that I hadn't gotten to see the remake of the Stepford Wives in theaters, that I had to wait til its DVD release. In the meantime, the original was on sale for $10.00 - "oh, okay - this one will do for now - at least get me familiar with the story". Buying that disc was the very best thing that ever happened to me - or at least in the top 10. Upon initial viewing, it seems to move rather slowly, then it picks up with our introduction to Bobbi Markowe (played by the brilliant Paula Prentiss) who pops up looking for Joanna Eberhart (the sublime Katharine Ross) because she read about her in the community newsletter. Their friendship is a very warm, affectionate and touching one, especially when you consider what will happen to these ladies. Bobbi and Joanna grouse about the Men's Association and decide to form a women's group in response. None of the women they approach will hear of such a thing, blissfully busy with ironing and gardening, and BAKING, which they discover when their women's group (seems to) finally get off the ground. The two recruit another suburban housewife, Charmaine Wimperis (portrayed in a pleasantly surprising performance by Tina Louise), who complains about her husband wanting her to dress in rubber suits, and who also admits the Men's Association is "unfair and sexist, but FRANKLY - ANYTHING that gets him out of the house at night is fine with me".Now, when I say the group SEEMS TO get off the ground, it really doesn't, but it starts off nicely enough. Joanna and Charmaine express their frustration in their marriage, while THE WIVES stare blankly, but one of them does open up. Kit Sundersen expresses sadness that....she didn't have time to BAKE yesterday because scrubbing the floors took too much time. Another WIFE, Marie Axhelm, suggests she try Easy-On spray starch. Now, what in God's name does spray starch have to do with scrubbing floors? See, Marie is addicted to ironing, so spray starch is her whole life. Now, how often have any of you out there tried to "get something off the ground" only to end up with egg on your face? This scene is particularly riotous in that this happens to us all.That's one point of appeal for this film - we can all identify with the situations these women go through. I don't mean that we're all going to be murdered and replaced by look-alike robots, but there are situations in real life in which individuals threaten to break our spirit, cannot tolerate our individuality, and take a plan of action, due to which, they don't have to put up with us anymore.This film is a spot-on satire of what men want from women and the lengths they'll go through to get it. It is also a unique way of spotlighting peer pressure and conformity. Along with Ross, Prentiss and Louise, the film boasts a supporting cast of Peter ("Exorcism is a Catholic embarrassment...") Masterson - Franklin ("The Jeffersons' Honky Willis) Cover - Nanette Newman and Patrick O'Neal as Dale Coba, the main man responsible for this whole thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtle, Foreboding, And Eerie Suspense Thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A rather well-known and deserved cult classic, "The Stepford Wives" is a quirky little suspense mystery that has aged very well. Katharine Ross plays Joanna Eberhart, an aspiring photographer and housewife who moves from New York City to the small community of Stepford, Connecticut, with her husband and two small daughters. The town is the epitome of the "American dream" - the men are successful businessman, the wives are great cooks and housekeepers - not to mention they all live in upscale homes in nice neighborhoods. But is this community just a little too perfect? Joanna begins to sense something chauvinistic about Stepford, with the men running everything and the women being as submissive as can be, spending all their time conversing about fabric softener and constantly cleaning. After befriending another woman new to the town, Bobby (Paula Prentiss), the two try and discover what is really going on behind the seemingly perfect community.A very strange but satisfying horror film, "The Stepford Wives" is an excellent movie. The story is based on the best-selling novel by Ira Levin (the author of "Rosemary's Baby", which was also made into a film a few years earlier). I haven't read the book, so I can't really compare the two - but if the book is anything like the film, I'm sure it's great. I really can't say that I wouldn't want to read it sometime (same goes for "Rosemary's Baby"). The story is fairly slow-building, but there's a subtle eeriness about it that keeps things interesting despite it's forgivable slow moments. The film is set in a beautiful neighborhood, with sunny pool sides and well-kept gardens. Stepford is like the idyllic American town. But despite that overall assumption, this film also captures the eeriness of it's perfection. Something, and I'm not quite sure what it is, makes the daylight seem really scary, and the quiet and peaceful neighborhood a foreboding and uncomfortable place.The acting in particular is very good. Katharine Ross is the leading lady, and she plays her role of the intuitive woman who is playing detective in order to find out what the town is hiding. Paula Prentiss is her sidekick (but also close friend) who feels the exact same way about the Stepford women. Peter Masterson is the ignorant husband, Walter, who has gotten himself into something that is way over his head. Mary Stuart Masterson (real-life and on-screen daughter of Peter Masterson) also made her first movie appearance in this film, as one of Joanna and Walter's daughters. Overall, good performance all around. The film obviously has something to say, and underlying messages that are actually pretty easy to catch onto. The main theme deals with conformity, anti-feminism, and male chauvinism, and these elements in the story easily come through the characters themselves. The storyline is pretty clearly a social commentary on reactions to women's liberation, which was a big thing in the 1960s and '70s. The conclusion to the film is excellent and fitting, and while it may not the an ideal way to end the story, it's perfect. I won't go into any details because I don't want to give away spoilers, just see this wonderful little chiller for yourself.Overall, "The Stepford Wives" is a creepy little horror movie that is unique and rewarding. It has good acting, perfect atmosphere, but most importantly a very original story. This is another one of those timeless classics as far as I'm concerned, even though it doesn't seem to be recognized as one. I've heard bad things about the remake, and that it was turned into more of a comedy than anything, so I'm not even sure I'll bother seeing it. But if you want to see a subtle and eerie little 1970s horror film, "The Stepford Wives" can be a great treat. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joanna faces a dilemma. On the one hand she can go along with her husband?who's already bought the new house?and kids, leave their apartment in the noise of New York City, and take up residence in the bucolic community of Stepford, Connecticut. Or she can say no.This might have been the time to say no.Well, she decides to go along to get along, though not particularly happily (it's clear Walter isn't getting his desired water supply). In first scene at their new digs a statuesque doll-like neighbor lady delivers a casserole to them. Then with a perfect smile and after some unblinking smalltalk, the neighbor lady turns and strolls back as if she were part of a wedding procession.Walter's thinking, "Odd, but look at them bazoombas."The town has a Men's Association, with all the trappings of a secret society, which Walter feels privileged to join. Joanna finds her way around town. She notices several of these doll women, thinking, "Odd, maybe there's something in the water."She soon runs into another normal woman Bobbie Markowe (Paula Prentiss). Normal =&gt; thinking for themselves, being funloving and creative, and wanting to make a difference in the community. I.e., in those days, strident feminists.As Joanna and Bobbie continue to ask questions, it's becoming obvious someone or something is turning the beautiful women of Stepford?the unattractive women seem unaffected?into voluptuous zombies. Zombies who happen to love giving sex to their husbands or doing the dishes with equal gusto.When Charmaine (Tina Louise) succumbs to the puppet masters, it's like Invasion of the Body Snatchers. The women freak, doing their best to fight the sinister club. And I won't spoil the ending.### This is the only version of the movie that is worth seeing, and it is really worth seeing. The performances are brilliant. The nefarious Men's Club plot to turn their women into beautiful, mindless, domestic nymphos is convincing? even if we really don't believe men really want that kind of woman.The movie generates considerable conversation along those lines, namely, what person of either gender finds an automaton attractive? It stirs some feminist thinking, too. For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2007</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the re-make of this film boasts an all-star cast with the likes of Bette Midler, Glenn Close, Nicole Kidman, and Matthew Broderick it still falls short of the original. The original story is compelling, thrilling, even terrifying while the re-make is fun it also takes a terrifying subject matter and turns it into campy comedy. This is best viewed as a thriller/horror movie and in my opinion it is much more effective cinematically because there is so much more that can be done in terms of character development as opposed to having one dimensional characters like those in the re-make whose sole intentions are to make you laugh. Paula Prentis does an excellent job here as Bobby when she makes you giggle and laugh in the beginning and yet is actually quite terrifying after her Stepford-style "transformation". The same is true with the other women of Stepford. You have an eerie feeling of pending doom throughout this film, a crucial element in the telling of the story that is missing from the re-make which gives away the secrets of Stepford almost immediately whereas, the original takes it's time and pulls the strings of tension tighter and tighter with scenes like the accident in the grocery store parking lot or the garden party scene. The settings and costuming are also much more effective and elaborate in this one. Watch this before you watch the re-make to get the entire story of Stepford.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The making of a catchphrase</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this might not be one of the greatest movies of all time ? it is no more than a routine, competently made, sci-fi horror story ? its timing could not have been better. In 1975 women's liberation was still a raging issue and the film had something to ask. Do men or some of them see women as fellow humans or as a lower form of life sent to serve them? Now, 30 years later we are in the middle of a conservative social backlash and women are being told to assume their previous inferior position. Yet when this story was re-made in 2004 it was played for laughs rather than horror, as if the battle had been won, and the plot came across as anachronistic.Katharine Ross, whose subsequent career has been mainly in television, is believable as the baffled and frightened Joanna, but the standout performance is from the rather underrated Paula Prentice as her spirited friend Bobbie. The rest of the acting is pretty routine, especially from Patrick O'Neal as head nerd Dale Coba, who just stands there and glowers menacingly most of the time, wasting a wonderful villain's role. Christopher Walken and Glen Close did better as the villains in the re-make.An odd feature in the movie is that the Stepford Wives, despite being designed like Playboy bunnies, spend much of their time promenading in full-length Edwardian style dresses and broad-brimmed hats. According to the screenwriter William Golding in his book "Adventures in the Screen Trade" (1983) this came about because the English director Bryan Forbes has cast his wife Nanette Newman, an accomplished actor but in her forties and no bunny as one of the Wives. So the solution was to put all the Wives in long dresses, though the ample charms of one or two (Tina Louise as Charmaine Wimperis for example) still show through.It is not suggested here that all men are misogynists, but that men in the computer and IT industries have a tendency that way. In the 1970s there were very few women, especially at senior levels in these industries; now there are some right at the top (where they have found it just as insecure as the men have ? remember the lady from Hewlett-Packard). In this film Joanna (Katharine Ross) has a husband Walter (Peter Masterton) who is a busy lawyer, but he is nevertheless persuaded by the computer nerd husbands of Stepford to consider their solution to the uppity wife problem. Now of course Joanna might well consider "Stepfordisation" as the answer to an uppity husband. That would have made a much better remake.It might be just a B-movie with A- grade production values but this film has slipped a phrase into the language, the Stepford Wife, a male fantasy that arose out of the emancipation of women. Social change is not amenable to being rolled back, but the film does remind us that not all are happy with social progress, though the real-life dissidents are not likely to use such extreme measures to regain their power. They are more likely just to sit around in the Men's Club grumbling about their wives, ex-wives and alimony, not realising that life with an equal partner can be immensely more fulfilling than life with a self-effacing sex-slave.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie kept me interested. It was definitely scarier and more interesting than the 2004 remake, although that new version was good in a comical sort of way! The beginning was sort of dull but it got exciting when she was trying to figure out what was wrong with stepford. It got really exciting when she found her friend change after she came back from vacation!Spoilers: It got really exciting toward the end when Joanna was tricked into going to the men's association to get killed by being told that her children were there. They tricked her even more by making a recording of her children's voice calling her. When she saw the robot version of herself, I was hoping she would be a hero and kill the robot and that man but instead, the robot strangles her! But the movie kept me interested. It was very scary and good in a weird sort of way! If you want a movie that's less dark, less morbid and more comical, see the new one! Possible spoiler for the new version: The new one has no murdering! And as modern technology has changed, it certainly has in the new version!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the recent publicity of The 2004 Stepford Wives it prompted me to rent the original 1975 release, which I have never seen. I liked the 70's style perception and filming technique. I am a great mystery and suspense film fan and this movie really hit the spot. It was even better than I expected. The cast, especially Katherine Ross, gave their characters life with genuine emotion. Even the ending of this film was satisfying.After hearing the new release is more of a dark comedy and doesn't follow the original plot line it made me want to scream "NOT ANOTHER LOUSY TWISTED REMAKE OF A FANTASTICALLY GREAT ORIGINAL". Why do people do this? And it has Comedy? That definitely destroys the purpose of the original, which is a suspense thriller.Comedy would really kill the mood.Yes, remakes can be better than originals, but in this case I don't know how the "remake" can even compare.</fullReview>

Now as she looks around Stepford she see's that the women are to much into cooking and cleaning and pleasing their men. What is more strange is that must of these women are beutiful and the men need a "queer eye for the straight guy". Released in 1975! The Stepford Wives was released on home video in 1997! there have been 3 TV-MOVIE sequels which were "Revenge of the Stepford Wives" "The Stepford Children" and "The Stepford Husbands". These movies again were made for TV and they are what they are! HoweverThe 2004 remake is worth watching but please see this first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Welcome to stepford. What chilling words they are! I have never stpooed loving this movie through the years, it is simply fantastic. It has all the best things that go into a good thriller. It is scary, entertaining(with a bit of satire), well acted, creepy, and SO darn fascinating! These characters and some of the more vivid scenes have stayed with me, as has the book. Way to go Ira Levin!I actually preferred the book a bit to the movie because the book goes into more detail as to why things are the way they are. It is a bit more scary then the movie, but the movie has an almost erie creepiness that stays with you as much as the book.SPOILERS: My one problem is something I'm sure many have thought of and many have raised. WHY? Why would ALL the men of stepford agree to this? I could see 1 or 2 but every guy in the town? Neither the book or the movie ever really explain this, nor go into heavy depth on walter and joanna's relationship so you never really get the character development of the men or understand what led to their agreeing to this besides the desire for a sexy obedient wife.I ALWAYS wanted a part two of this(NOT the dreadful "revenge of the stepford wives") but a REAL part two-alas it wasn't meant to be. I sure hope the updated version is GOOD, I'm a little worried about that, though if anyone can do it justice it'd be Nicole Kidman. But this movie stands on its own as very definetly well done, well acted and fascinating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh, I am a fan of the novel. Well, just as much as I am a fan of the movie. I think that it is a great thriller. Everyone knows the story of The Stepford Wives. Okay, here it is for those who don't: A Joanne (a strong willed woman) and her children are moved out of there home in New York City by her husband. They move to the nice, quite town of Stepford. Joanne immidiatly notices something is wrong, for every woman in the town is the perfect housewife. She makes one other normal friend in Stepford, but when she turns into one of the Stepford Wives, Joanne starts to investigate discovering a horrifying secret.This really is a great movie. Not only a thriller, but it does talk about womans status in society. When the mayor of the men's association answers Joannes question of why with, 'Because we can.' Oh, I just want to tear him apart. For those of you who have never seen the movie, you don't know what I'm talking about. For those of you that have, you have to agree with me!But, all in all, it is a classic movie. It should be a must see on everyones list. But, if you can, you should really read the book. It explains everything so much better. 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sign of a good film is whether or not it stays with you. This one has stayed with me since I first saw it in '75 &amp; I enjoy it every time I watch it. It's a great mix of horror, suspense, &amp; dark humor. Katherine Ross is very good as the heroine Joanna. Although she appears borderline anorexic, she still looks kind of cool even by today's standards, with her long, pretty hair &amp; (non-Brady Bunch ugly) 70's clothes. Paula Prentiss is definately a highlight in this film. She's actually a breath of fresh air as soon as she appears on screen. Her character Bobbie is an older, wiser, big, just as goofy (God love her) version of Tuggle Carpenter, the character she played in her debut film "Where The Boys Are" in 1960. You feel Joanna's shock, loss, &amp; horror when Bobbie is transformed into a robo-Martha Stewart. I don't know about anyone else but I sensed some sexual tension between Joanna &amp; the semi-dykie therapist. There was something kinda creepy about her &amp; I wasn't sure if she was legit or not the first time I saw this movie. The men are a bunch of boring, physically unappealing buffoons. You get the feeling they know they better do something soon about their wives before these women get a good look at them!! Tina Louise (with HUGE hair) plays a great supporting role as tennis loving Charmaine. This movie is miles ahead of the idiotic TV-movie "sequel" "Revenge of The Stepford Wives" (with Sharon Gless &amp; Julie Kavner as a bargain basement Paula Prentiss) because it tampered with the original premise so it makes no sense. Don't even bother with that mess, but definately watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good little horror flick that just has something special about it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will admit, this movie isn't a masterpiece. It's kind of slow and sure isn't up to the standard of Ira Levin's previous film adaptation "Rosemary's Baby," but hey, neither was the book. I think the most appealing aspects of this movie are the performances by the two leads Katharine Ross (The Graduate) and Paula Prentiss (Man's Favorite Sport?.) Ross plays a young wife, mother of 2, who moves to Stepford, Connectituct with her family. There she makes friends with Prentiss and the two start to suspect something of the perpetually blissful wives of Stepford who are intent on nothing but pleasing their families. The two leads carry on so well together that we are reminded of any other time we moved to a strange new place and made that first critical friend. Ross is vibrant, charasmatic, cool and compassionate and Prentiss provides a complimentary sense of humour and an outgoing spirit. The movie critisizes first, and then tries to scare you. The decision to integrate dark humour, mocking suburban lifestyles and sexist marital expectations, saves the film from becoming a run of the mill spook picture. As far as scariness is concerned, I've got to admit, it's not relentless horror, if that's what you're looking for. But, what there is is way better than average. Mounting suspense,one good sudden shock and how much we are made to care for the likable leads make up most of the fright factor. It seems like "The Stepford Wives" has been popping up a bit more lately. For it's early critics: would this ever had happened if the movie didn't have something to offer? A good horror movie, with this much insight, is RARE these days, and that's why "The Stepford Wives" has endured.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mediocre feminist fable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the novel of the same name by Ira Levin, The Stepford Wives film begins when Joanna Eberhart (Katherine Ross) moves with her husband and children from New York City to the small village of Stepford.Joanna finds that nearly all of the wives in Stepford are placid drones whose only ambition is cooking and cleaning. The Stepford Wives is very much a 1970's film with overtones of environmental pollution,powerful corporate conspiracies,sexuality, and of course feminist dogma.I disagree with the heavy-handed feminist message of the film which is that most men would prefer their wives to be obedient maids rather then equal partners.There are a few good moments in The Stepford Wives though. Tina Louise does very well with a small role and it's hard not to feel pity for her when she confesses that her husband never really loved her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So this movie is based on a novel by the man who also wrote "Rosemary's baby". That's a hard task to live up to. OK I wasn't expecting it to be as good as the aforementioned movie but with an interesting premise like this I was quite underwhelmed by the result. It's shocking how little is actually happening despite a duration of almost 2 hours. Pacing is slow and there is too much dialog that really isn't much helping the story forward. With the exception of main actress Katharine Ross, the characters don't seem very important getting little elaboration. There is obviously a lot going on in that little quiet town but not very much is shown. In the end the mystery is revealed but still I would have wanted to know more than the poor explanation of Mr Dis in the ending why the men were doing that to their wives plus how did they come up with these clones. Surely a pretty drawing can't be enough? I hated the ending, hoped our heroine could have found a way to fight back. That was pretty sad for all the efforts she did. I was hoping she at least could have escaped that sad fate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joanne and her husband are tired of the city and want to movie the children somewhere nice and peaceful. So they move to this town where there is something wrong with the women. The women all seem to be the same type of woman meaning that they have no opinion, are obsessed with house keeping and only live to serve their husbands. This is my worst night mare realized. So this was a very frightening movie for me to see and I was scared to death when Joanne went over to her friends house only to realize that she too was one of them. I think that I would just forget my kids and drive far away and never look back. Joanne didn't want to give up on her photography and I would hate to give up on my dreams too. That's why this movie is so scary for women. Especially women with dreams and goals away from their house. Creepy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ira Levin was a terrific writer .He seemed fascinated by small conspiracies (This story and "Rosemary's baby") as well as huge ones (the world of his classic sci-fi "this perfect day" ) Actually,Levin's novel fuses "Rosemary's baby"(1967:the novel of course!) secret plot with this unbearable happiness depicted in his nineteen eighty fouresque "perfect day" (1970).Johanna is not unlike Rosemary ;both are modern feminist women who discover a strange conspiracy which might exist in their mind only;when Johanna visits her shrink,how can't we think of Rosemary and Dr Hill?These Levinesque heroines see their familiar every day life fragment at the edges and one day they are on their own,against apparently nice people.The difference between "Rosemary 's baby" and " the Stepford wives" lies in the directing:the former is an undisputed masterpiece while the latter is only a good film,which is not that bad ,after all ,mainly if you have watched Oz's remake starring Nicole Kidman,an absolute turkey.Katherine Ross is an excellent actress and her female co-stars are good,but the male cast is rather weak,particularly the husband.As Levin's novel is rather short (about 150 pages) it was fleshed out by additional scenes not included in the novel;all are not irrelevant but one of last ones which "explains" what happened to Joanne is overkill.The very last scene is ,on the other hand,faithful to the book.There are many funny lines ,and I sometimes wonder whether the writer did not write some spoof on women's lib.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent thriller with a few points to make</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What we have here is a film that sort of bridges the gap between suburbanite drama and extremely dark science fiction. The story is massively famous by now and has obvious implications about gender roles and each sex's thoughts towards their spouse. However, at its heart, The Stepford Wives is a brilliant mystery thriller that has as much in the way of intrigue as it does in social commentary. The film is based on a book by Ira Levin, who previously wrote feminist horror novel 'Rosemary's Baby'. The two films are somewhat similar in theme as both focus around what is usually seen as women's work - childbirth in Rosemary's Baby and keeping house in this film. The plot focuses around the town of Stepford and the Eberhart family who are new in town. It would seem that something is up with the place immediately as the women seem completely detached and only interested in house work. The wife, Joanna, soon meets up with fellow new arrival Bobbie Markowe and the two begin to believe that something has happened to the other women, and decide to investigate.The atmosphere is a key element in this film, and director Bryan Forbes capitalises on that by giving Stepford a welcoming atmosphere that always borders on being mysterious and somehow not quite right. The story can be a little slow at times, and as most people will know the twist before going into the film, it can sometimes feel like its taking ages to get where it's going. However, the film keeps the audience interested by constantly hinting at the problem with Stepford and feeding us only small pieces of the puzzle at a time. It has to be said that the plot doesn't completely make sense - there are a few plot holes, and the reason for the men in Stepford wanting a "Stepford wife" doesn't really stand up to scrutiny - but I feel that The Stepford Wives finds making it's point to be more important than minor plot details, and it does that well. It all boils down to a nice conclusion, which wraps up the story well and provides a nice little shock for the audience to digest. Overall, The Stepford Wives isn't quite a masterpiece - but it's certainly a very good film and I definitely recommend it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite frankly, I imagined that this movie would be a campy, cheesy portrait of suburban life with a happy ending. That prediction was based upon my having seen previews for the 2004 version of the film. I promised myself, however, that I would watch the original first, and I am glad I stuck with that decision. I have not yet viewed the remake, but I feel utterly thrilled to have watched this film. It is a stunning, honest portrait of the traditional American dream. I credit the writer, primarily, with creating such a poignant story. Unfortunately, our society (or are we civilized enough to be a society?) continues to value antiquated ideas about gender roles and the balance of power between men and women. The conclusion, certainly not suited for viewers who prefer the quickly-wrapped happy ending, sparkles not because of a satisfying resolution, but because of its alarming outcry to audiences--beware of chauvinism's enduring reins! Without individuality, we not only lose our souls--we create our own Stepford.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At least KATHARINE ROSS is more effective here than she was in the dreadful THE SWARM (performance-wise), but once again she reminds me of the robot-like performances Jeanne Crain used to give in earlier days with the same kind of model perfect beauty. The same kind of detachment too, although here at least she suggests an inquisitive mind at work.And no wonder she's inquisitive. She never saw women more dedicated to housework than THE STEPFORD WIVES who seem fixated about using the right detergents and being "perfect wives" for their hubbies. Being an independent sort of liberated woman, she resents all this conformity. The film is really a spoof on women's lib, with strong feminist leanings thrown into the screenplay and can't decide whether it's a sci-fi horror film or a downright comedy, but manages to be both. Certain lines and situations had audiences giggling at the goings on.As two of her best friends who also show some degree of independence until they become Stepfordized, PAULA PRENTISS and TINA LOUISE are effectively cast, especially Prentiss who has some of the film's most caustic comments and observations to make. She easily takes the focus off Ross' more conventional, low-key role.Whether you enjoy this on the level of a comedy or a sci-fi horror film, it's another clever tale from the pen of Ira Levin (ROSEMARY'S BABY), not quite as chilling but certainly more fun to watch. PATRICK O'NEAL does a nice job as the head of an evil institution who plays a big part in the stories' strange outcome.</fullReview>

It was made in the seventies, what can you expect? The tag line should read "women shouldn't be made to be housewives" Don't get me wrong- the husbands were completely at fault for their heinous crimes. They were the bad guys. But I can't help but think that the women who try to please their husbands and chose not to pursue a career are looked down upon. That is definitely the message of the movie, but it's a little hard to analyze at the time because you'll be totally spooked!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE MOVIE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Stepford Wives is simply my all-time favorite movie. It has everything in it. Sexy women like Katherine Ross and Paula Prentiss, a plot that keeps you guessing right till the end and in my opinion the most scariest scene in film history. That scene still gives me the chills to this day.I like the fact that the film didn't depend on many special effects. It was more of a psychological fright that kept you fascinated.You have to watch this movie several times to pick up on all the subtle scenes in it. The movie also had some terrific lines in it. I repeat these lines to this very day. I really wanted to see this movie when it first came out in 1975 but my parents wouldn't allow me to see it. I finally saw it for the first time on TV in 1983. The film is unusual because it starts out like a pleasant movie and slowly evolves into creeping horror. What I also found interesting is that Mary Stuart Masterson who playedone of the daughters of the main couple also played in At Close Range years later with Christopher Walken who is in The Stepford Wives 2004.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie had such a great storyline and direction!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had everything in it! I was so annoyed when I found out the 2004 remake wasn't anything like this movie! I loved what Ira Levin and the makers of this movie were saying. The movie was so truthful about a mother's hold on life and her hopes and dreams, and of her friendships...I really wish this movie could have been explored more with different endings and takes on it, but I really loved this movie!The casting in this film was great! The actors and actresses stood truthful to their roles, Joanna and Walter Eberhart really seemed like a true couple, and everyone that Joanna met in this town called Stepford really acted unrealistic (which was good) - Everyone that Walter met seemed too dominant (they were power-hungry men) - So I really loved how every woman and man they met had been changed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gothic cautionary tale for women.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE STEPFORD WIVES is a semi-interesting cult-film that tells the story about a young wife (Katharine Ross) who together with her family moves from New York to suburban Stepford were she soon starts suspecting that there's something wrong beneath the all too perfect surface. The film goes on and on without all too much happening, and the supposed mystic suspense covering the fundamentals aren't very suspensive. As the film tells this cautionary tale for women, as we see housewives becoming robotized by their husbands, it keeps plotting in stuff for a women's lib likes it's the only reason it was made. Annoying to some degree, and it's certainly propaganda. The film looks quite good, and the climax is particularly interesting as our girl (Ross) goes face to face with her own black-eyed double and realizes that everything she suspected was true. The film is worth the look, but don't expect an exciting chiller, because it isn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Regardless of their final opinions, I agree wholeheartedly with every reviewer around here who stated that potential viewers of "The Stepford Wives" should completely avoid reading anything about it. Most of the reviews and even plot synopsizes blatantly reveal the events occurring during the last fifteen minutes of the film, and that really can't be the point since the first hour and an half mysteriously builds up towards that. I simply dropped an eye on the plot keywords and already the movie was more or less "ruined" to me, so I'll do my extra best not to reveal too much but that is difficult, seeing that even referring to similar films might be saying too much. "The Stepford Wives" is a fresh and engaging Sci-Fi/suburban black comedy, adapted from a novel written by the same guy who also thought up "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Boys from Brazil" (what further recommendation do you need?) and atmospherically taking place in the typically 'small town with a dark secret' setting. The pacing is rather slow and director Bryon Forbes patiently takes the time to draw the characters and the town's mentality, so this honestly isn't the ideal film for horror fanatics swearing by violent 70's trash &amp; exploitation. On the other hand, if you appreciate moody ambiances and unusual concepts, I can warmly recommend "The Stepford Wives". Housewife and amateur photographer Joanna Eberhart is a bit overwhelmed when her husband Walter suddenly decides to leave Manhattan and settle in the suburban dream called Stepford. She tries to adapt but simply doesn't fit in with the other women in town, since they are so frustratingly docile and obedient to their husbands. While the male population of Stanford gathers in exclusive clubs and do whatever they please, their wives can only talk about cooking and cleaning. Joanna eventually does befriend a couple of other newly-arrived women, but when their personas also abruptly change, she's convinced there's something very wrong in this town. The plot, build-up and denouement bear some obvious resemblances to another milestone in the Sci-Fi genre; released first in the late 50's and once again in another and equally impressive version during the late 70's. Can't really state the title, but people with only a moderate interest in the genre will already know which one I'm referring to. But nonetheless, this movie definitely has its own solid character and personality (pun intended) and multiple sequences ? especially near the end ? are stupendous. Terrific acting performances from Katharine Ross and Paula Prentiss and the masterful musical guidance from Maurice Small contribute to the great power as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Based on the 1972 Ira Levin novel the film "The Stepford Wives" seems to be a violent backlash against the Womens Liberation Movements of those days. With the men folks finally getting control of their wives who have become totally uncontrollable and out of hand. It's when the Eberharts Walter &amp; Joanna, Peter Masterson &amp; Katharine Ross, together with their two young daughters Kim &amp; Amy, Mary Stuart Masterson &amp; Ronny Sullivan, move from the big noisy and crime ridden city of New York to the peaceful and quite setting of Stepford Connecticut that their troubles instead of ending begins.Everything is so peaceful and quite in Stepford that it drives those living there almost crazy until they finally,after months of intense conditioning, get the hang of it. Especially disturbing to Joanna, who's a professional photographer, is the by the books and follow orders of the women or wives in town who are so dedicated to their husbands and housework that they seem to be under some kind of mind control. This all soon drives Joanna to drink just to feel that she's normal. It's later when Joanna's old man Walter joins the local Stepford Men's Association that things really start to get out of whack for her.Always away and leaving her alone with the kids and the housework Joanna feels that old man Walter is spending his days out on the town with some young chick instead of playing cards and pool with the members of the mens club. The truth of what Walter is really involved with, in the super secretive Stepford Men's Association, is far worse then Joanna could have ever imagined. It also drive Joanna to seek help from her new found friend in Stepford Bobbie Markowe, Paula Prentiss, who unlike the other wives in town still seems to her her head on straight. That's until she becomes Zombified when she planned to leave town and her mind controlling husband for good. Unknown to both Joanna &amp; Bobbie their husbands are planing to straighten them out in keeping them in line and following orders like all the other wives in town! And what's even worse their doing it with both Joanna &amp; Bobbie unknowingly helping them do it!***SPOILERS*** We get an inkling of what lead to this Zombifying process of the women of Stepford Connecticut from the President of the Stepford Men's Association Dale "Diz" Coba, Patrick O'Neal. It's when the Women's Liberation Movement started to take hold and turn wives against their husbands that "Diz" and his fellow outraged husbands came up with this idea of putting their wives back into line. That's by expunging their brains of all the bad things,in Diz and Co. minds, that the Women's Lib Movement put into them. In doing this it took very drastic and sometimes even criminal actions to put their plan into full operation. As we see as the film ends even the feisty Joanna Eberhart soon lost her self-control and ended up joining the club: The the extremely passive and anti feminist Stepford Wives. That's when her will was finally broken and her both mind and body as well as soul was taken over by a sinister and unseen, until it was too late for Joanna, entity! An entity that the Stepford Men's Association lead by "Diz" Coba, that included her husband Walter, created just for her and in her own image!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fantastic Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taking unwanted variables out of our lives is dream to all of us, but sometimes it can go too far.This is rather adult themed movie. Children would not understand what the hell this movie is all about. With 2/3 of marriages destined to failure in this country, it's not surprising that such a drastic solution came to bear. Ira Levin once again brings the shocking to the story.The movie is done much better than the 2003 remake. Katherine Ross is a much better fit for this role than Kidman. But not only that, the entire mood and the acting of this movie is better done. Period. It's a fantastic movie. It's not a horror, it's not a science fiction, it's in a genre all its own. There's something sterile and mechanical about the whole movie. It's not just the wives that are that way. There're no other movie that has this quality to it. The people of Stepford has a secret, but it's not a bad secret. It's perfectly legal. That makes this movie benign despite the rather shocking premise. Katherine Ross has just the right steadiness to play the wife that gradually finds out the truth.The movie is also done beautifully, and all this comes together to make this one of a kind entertainment, and a crowning achievement in American cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary, for a number of reasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remade recently, The Stepford Wives is one of those films whose fearful implications go beyond the scope of its material. In an interview, one star of the remake, none other than Bette Midler, claimed that the scenario depicted what men really wanted from women. Yes, she apparently really said that. Yet my family wonder why I see her as evil incarnate, with her comments on why she turned down Kathy Bates' role in Misery only adding to the digust.Anyway, there are two possible explanations for this statement. One is that Midler simply doesn't get the story, making her a vapid, drooling moron. The other is that she really believes this, and doesn't quite get that there are men in the world, like myself, who would be bored senseless by a woman who only says "yes sir, no sir, three bags full, sir...", as my commentary on the excerable Return Of The King adaptation makes clear. This explanation is even worse, as it says a lot of things about the feminist agenda that are very frightening.The 1975 production of The Stepford Wives cares more about character and atmosphere, which is the right way to approach a story like this. On first viewing, it seems that a lot of the time the film takes up is merely filler. However, as the subsequent viewings make plot details clearer, the effective manner in which the time is used becomes apparent. By building characters we care about, the scenes that are meant to creep us out actually manage to do so. The scene in which we discover the awful truth of what is going on in Stepford absolutely chills to the bone, and it is all because the film is kind enough to take the time to set it up.The final scene, in which we see the women of Stepford doing their supermarket stroll, absolutely sends a shudder of horror through this viewer. The main villain of the piece tries to tell us this is bliss, and it may well have no complicating factors like young women wanting something better for themselves, but I call it hell. Although I can't say for certain, I think Bryan Forbes would agree. At least, I hope so, because the implication of anyone, leave alone a director, thinking this is somehow ideal, is just plain disturbing.Speaking of disturbing, this film, and the novel upon which it is based, has influenced a whole generation of stories along the lines of mind control. Another of the dismal failures in this would be 1998's Disturbing Behaviour, which at 84 minutes, doesn't even give its cast enough time to develop mannerisms, leave alone a personality or enough personality to make the events depicted matter.I gave The Stepford Wives, circa 1975, a seven out of ten. It is very dated, its cinematography somewhat flat, but the story is just as relevant now as it was then, even if the reason has changed. It is well worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't bother with the remake ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw the original and my brother saw the remake - from the details swapped it seems to me that they've completely changed the film and novel from being amazingly feminist stories to bland servings of Nicole Kidman looking too perfect for words.The original is a brilliant film due to its setting and creation during the height of the feminist movement in the states, which is something that adds to the story, and its remake fails to recognize this. I watched this with my Mom, and she identified with the time politically, socially and fashionably (!) so much, it was fun to hear her reminisce about her time ? she yes, she too dabbled with women's lib ? but we have a messy kitchen, so we're all okay.A funny little anecdote ? the day after I saw this I went into work and the boss had bought a new dish scrubber for the kitchenette, and we got talking about it and how much better it was than the old one, which admittedly was old and scungy! How Stepford! I felt like pinching myself!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great suspense choked by its weak idealism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Stepford Wives is an undeniably well-made film, straight outta the miraculous-for-film '70s. In the midst of the feminism movement the film set the standard for what was to be a changing social moray. However, one wonders how much this film with a clear agenda is so dated.The film seems to take no consideration into a balance of feministic principles. Rather than making positive strides in the way of feminism the film belittles its ideals: the main characters are free women, yes, but all they seem to do is complain and drink scotch. In their "awareness" meetings, all they seem to do is moan about how their husbands spend too much time on work and not them. To me, that's not a very feminist ideal. Furthermore, the film degrades its own message by simplifying it to an "all men are bad, all women are victims" dichotomy.When the climactic scene of a so-called "feminist" film is a big-strong man chasing a helpless woman, I think something needs to be changed.See The Stepford Wives for it's wonderful suspense buildup and intriguing premise, because it certainly is a good movie. But try not to think too much about the feminist aspect, because it will only disappoint and frustrate you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wonder who's hooters those were? Katherine Ross was very pretty, albeit a little flat chested. Nice improvement!I may have to read the book as several things were left unexplained. For instance, did all the men know that the women were truly being "replaced"? Did they asist in this process? I mean with killing and everything. That is a little hard to accept, even with the obvious advantages; tits, cooking, servile attitude and all. Let's face it, there's a lot to like there, when being totally honest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Katharine Ross plays Joanna, a happily married woman who relocates from New York to the suburbs, where she has to readjust her career ambitions with this new situation, and when her husband becomes increasingly involved with a secretive men's club, does she suspect that things are not as they seem, and that she may be in danger, especially after the women start to act a little too happy being housewives...Based on Ira Levin's novel, story resembles his "Rosemary's Baby" premise in many ways, and though it is moderately interesting for its length, and has a good cast, I just did not find any of it believable(would men really do that?) Ending in the supermarket may produce laughter more than horror! Still, this is a cult favorite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I showed this film back to back with the 2004 remake to my critical viewing class for their final exam so that they could compare two identical stories and see differences in style, tone, social commentary and special effects. It was an interesting experience for all of us. While most of them liked the remake better (it was funny), there were a few young men who preferred the original. When I delightedly complimented them on their taste, it was only to find out that they preferred it because they thought women SHOULD be like Stepford wives--supportive of their husbands, in the background and always the sex kitten. We may have come a long way, but for some, not long enough.This is a wonderful film for depicting the early struggle of the feminist movement and how much of a threat it posed to some people's idea of traditional family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thriller about Men wanting the Perfect and Submissive Wive, and the Woman who does not want to become that</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the height of the Women's liberation movement during early 1970's it seemed that certain men were afraid of stronger women. Ira Levin used that to create a novel that is not necessarily great literature, but a novel that people are going to remember for a long time to come. The Stepford Wives proved to be a page tuner and a book that people could not just put down.By 1975 William Goldman and Bryan Forbes adapted the book into a motion picture, and while the movie has not aged with grace it does have that same hook at the novel.The movie begins with the Eberhart's moving out of New York City and into the town of Stepford, Connecticut. In this movie Joanna is a stay at home photographer. At first Joanna (Katharine Ross) is ready to began a new life, in spite of the way the woman behave, but as soon as she says how one of local women reacts after getting into a car accident she begins to have doubts. The doubts continue to grow when Joanna's husband Walter invites the local Men's Association to their home and one of its members does a black and white sketch of her (common art style in the 1970's (Remember the early titles of the TV Daytime Drama "Young &amp; the Restless" anyone?).Joanna meets up with another newcomer Bobbie Markowe (Paula Prentiss) to find out what is behind the women and their attitudes about being the best housewives to their men. They turn to Charmaine Wimperis (Tina Louise) who also moved in to town with her husband, and try to get some kind of women's group going, with little success. Soon enough, Charmanie is Stepfordtized and has giving up her love of Tennis, and is willing to do the housework that Wimperis housekeeper used to do. Bobbie thinks that the local water supply somehow connected to this but they end upshort. Eventually Bobbie becomes a Stepford wife and Joanna get even more frighten.She now wants to move out of Stepford but her husband tells her to go see a shrink which Joanna does and the good news is she is a women. Joanna tells her that she has a strong feeling that she will be the next woman to get the Stepford treatment. Sadly Dr. Fancher tells her that she another commitment but tells Joanna to get herself and her children out of Stepford A.S.A.P. However Walter is on to her, and sent the children away which leads to the climax in which Joanna confronts Dale Coba (Patrick O'Neal) who heads the Means Association.It seems that Coba is behind the Stepfordtizing (there are several Technological Plants in town that Joanna drives by in the film including one in Coba's name), and has the skills and the knowledge to create the perfect and submissive wife. He admitted earlier during his visit at the Eberhart home that he likes watching women doing "domestic chores." The buildup in the movie is different then the one in the book, but it has the same resolution and ending. The movie is not the greatest thriller in the world but it pulls you in and keeps you tied to your seat until the very end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, I could just squeeze the Charmaine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film serves primarily as a time capsule for people who want a slice of the zeitgeist of the late sixties/early seventies, when women were rebelling against the suffocating constraints of a social order that demanded they forego careers, stay at home, take care of the kids, and (gasp!) cook and clean.It seems positively silly by today's more enlightened standards, since, as we all know by now, it is actually MEN who have been carrying most of the load, and getting just as much of the proverbial shaft, if not more so, than women. (I think about these things alot, especially when I'm way up there, scraping the moss off the roof, because, heck, I don't know, society made me do it...).Many people regard this a horror or creep show. Just my humble opinion, but this film is more camp than creepy. However, I do like many things about the film: it reeks of suspense, atmoshpere, and a certain Martha Stewartesque ambience. It is quite nicely filmed, too, and Katherine Ross - despite her getting her back up throughout most of the film - is simply ravishing to look at. But hey, as long as your up, honey, get me a beer, eh?(I was thinking that when they showed the utter shocking horror of a woman actually doing some cooking and cleaning, they could have thrown in some of that "scrreeep scrreeep scrreeep" music from "Psycho"...)There's some huge 70's style cars in the picture (so much steel in them you could make two of today's cars out of one of them), and some groovy lines to boot. I liked the line from Tina Louise's character, Charmaine, when commenting about a women's focus group. "A consciousness-raising meeting.... You mean a bitch session?!"Finally, if you want to see a good movie (better than this one, anyway) on people being replaced, get a copy of "Seconds" (1966) starring the late Rock Hudson. Now THAT is a creepy film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard this film whispered about for years...it was much different than I thought it would be. I didn't figure it would be a creepy horror film. But where can a guy get a Stepford wife I wonder? Hmmmmmmm? I think in this high tech day and age we will soon have realistic sex androids you'll be able to buy. It certainly will make getting a decent looking chick much easier. Though I don't think any guy would want some boring housewife type gal like the ones in this movie, not me anyways. I think some women wouldn't mind a Stepford husband. Some young, strong, good lookin' Brad Pitt type who can fix all the stuff that breaks around the house, do the chores, and still take care o' bizniz in the romantic department quite well if ya catch m'drift.But fer me and a lot of other dudes a Stepford wife would be nice for the times when you are inbetween girlfriends. Us guys face a lot more rejection than females (a LOT more) so a Stepford android would be nice till you can hook up with another compatible real life female. Sounds great, don't it? In the future that means virtually any guy will be able to have virtually any chick. As long as he has the cash to afford an android built to his specifications. Not to mention that we will also have real life, state of the art virtual reality sex sometime in the near future I imagine. Will virtual reality sex and Stepford androids make women virtually irrelevant? I think not. Mmm-mmm, I luv technology!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Feminist Classic -- With Some Very Male-Friendly Elements</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This chilling and yet darkly humorous story of a luxurious American suburb where the weak, timid men have replaced their sexy, assertive wives with submissive robots has amused, unsettled and excited audiences of all ages and genders for over thirty years. The reason this story speaks to all ages and all audiences is because it wraps a feminist fable in a very familiar and male-friendly format. It is actually a classic male buddy drama in which the heroic males just happen to be two very beautiful and highly intelligent women. When Joanna (Katherine Ross) comes to Stepford, she doesn't fit in. And she soon teams up with Bobbie (Paula Prentiss) who is always laughing and joking, yet also feels like an outsider. So you have a brooding, intense, thoughtful hero, and a sidekick who is playful, funny, carefree and charming. Think of Pruitt and Maggio in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY. Think of Paul Newman and George Kennedy in Cool Hand Luke. Think of Paul Crewe and his buddy Caretaker from THE LONGEST YARD. It's a standard male scenario -- a loner against the system, with only one good buddy beside him. Paula Prentiss' Bobbie Marco is so much like Frank Sinatra's Maggio. Both sidekicks warn the hero early on that there is trouble ahead. ("Oh, my friend, you made a very bad mistake. This outfit they can give back to General Custer!") Both share the same fun, outgoing, friendly personality. Bobbie is an especially delicious character. She's so stunningly sexy, yet completely funny and down to earth. You just want to hug her. She's the caring best friend every woman wants to have -- and the knowing older woman every teenage boy dreams of being seduced by after school. She taps into the deepest fantasies of both sexes in a very reassuring way. Now, if you look at the men of Stepford, you notice that they are really sort of shadowy figures. No one man is really a tough guy, a brute, or a bully. It's the "system" that is menacing, no one individual. Just like in Cool Hand Luke, the "bosses" are a faceless group, and they break Joanna down little by little, just like Luke. They never shout at her or call her a b**ch, nor do they use open physical violence. They are as smarmy and phony as Luke's Captain, who keeps saying he is punishing Luke "for his own good." Joanna's husband, by the way, is a typical weak-willed philanderer, just like Capt. Dana "Dynamite" Holmes in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY. Just like Holmes, he feels pushed to agree to more and more cruelty against the decent outsider in order to "prove" himself to the male herd. "You can't be decent to a man like that, you have to treat him like an animal!"In the end, you know Bobbie and Joanna will be beaten by the Men's Group, just like Pruitt and Maggio will be beaten by the Army. But it's a hollow triumph, that of a faceless collective over deeply personal and lovable individuals. And the film's deepest point is not just the obvious feminist point that there's more to life than housework but a much larger (and already time honored) message of the rights of the individual against the power of the system. After thirty years, what a delicious, unique, and bitter sweet achievement this movie remains!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's wife Jim, but not as we know it ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Stepford Wives is a film with a lot of unfulfilled potential. The plot revolves around strange goings on in the suburban area of Stepford. A new couple move into the area and the wife (Katherine Ross) soon realises something is afoot. It all seems to resolve around a secretive men's organisation.There are a number of problem's with this film. Whilst the 70's was the classic area of paranoia films (think "The Parallax View", "All the president's men" etc), director Bryan Forbes fails to really convey the paranoia, tension and suspense needed. When compared to Polanski's "Rosemary's Baby" (another adaptation from an Ira Levin novel) it falls very flat indeed.The screenplay is not particularly strong. I'd be interested to seen William Goldman's original script - apparently Forbes completely rewrote it.The casting is all wrong too. According to the original novel (and Goldman's original screenplay) the wives themselves are supposed to playboy bunny types - the complete embodiment of the American ideal of a perfect woman. Nanette Newman may be a good actress, but centrefold material she is not. This somewhat destroys the husbands' motives. If you are going to make a replacement wife, you are going to make her as perfect as possible.It was rumoured that De Palma was considered for the director's role - I think this would have been a far more interesting film with him at the helm.Still, some of the concepts and themes are interesting - which in some ways makes it all the more disappointing that the final result is so flat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Good, Not Scary, but Somehow Important</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to be either very suggestible or very, very caffeinated to be frightened by this movie: its pace is glacial, its soft-focus look is more numbing than suggestive, and pretty much all the actors, save for Paula Prentiss who seems to think she's playing "Eunice" in a Carol Burnett show sketch, are trying to underplay their roles but come off as wooden or (if you'll pardon the expression) robotic. But why does everybody know what a "Stepford Wife" is, whether or not they've sat through this USA Network standard? Because, lame as it is, this film represents a watershed in popular culture: women's liberation had so penetrated the mass consciousness that it was now a feature of lowbrow genres like horror films (it had topped the charts one year earlier in a cheesy pop song by Helen Reddy, so I guess B-movies were the next step).Katharine Ross was briefly the most promising actress in Hollywood ("Graduate" and "Butch Cassidy" in less than 2 years), but this movie shows why she never became a major star -- she's pretty, but pretty annoying. She's acceptable as a supporting player but when she's asked to carry this movie, she responds by acting neurotic, self-absorbed and distant. Her affection for everybody, husband, children and even runnin' buddy Paula Prentiss, seems forced since she seems entirely unable to move beyond her own dissatisfaction -- man, did someone miss a casting opportunity when they didn't ask Ross to play Sylvia Plath. Since she's giving absolutely nothing to her supporting cast, every single scene seems to drag, a situation not helped by a film editor who seems to think it's "artistic" to let every scene last about five minutes past its actual ending. (Note: we understand what's happening to Paula Prentiss in her last scene, it goes from horrifying to banal pretty quickly.) Noteworthy, however, is Tina Louise, who never could act but turns in a performance that's at least commendable although not good as an unhappy adultress trapped in a loveless marriage. Her character deserved a movie, not Joanna the Sleepwalking Feminist, and she's the one you'll miss most when . . . oh, never mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disturbing thriller of man's revenge against women and what they really think of them and want of them.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the writer of "Rosemary's Baby" comes this surprisingly effective non-gory horror film about the domination of a man's world and where women fit into it. Photographer Katherine Ross has agreed to move with her husband Peter Masterson to the quaint town of Stepford where she immediately finds herself at odds with what is expected of women there. They are dressed picture-perfect, keep a beautiful home, calmy raise the children and play hostess for their husband's business associates, all the while seeming as far out of the world as Stepford is from Ross's home of New York City. She meets one chum with feisty Paula Prentiss, and even strikes a cord with the tennis-playing Tina Louise (looking absolutely ravishing and quite moving in a scene where she emotionally admits she realizes that her husband doesn't truly love her) but their world of seeming normalcy is coming to a quick end, and so might Ross's if the Stepford husbands have their way in manipulating Masterson.The film sometimes moves at a painfully slow pace but there are moments of brilliance that will live with you beyond the end of the movie. When the audience first sees Louise playing tennis, it is thrilling to see the former Ginger Grant playing a very fleshed-out character that is something more than just a goddess of beauty. She's quite her own person even if she's determined to make her husband Franklin Cover ("The Jefferson's" Tom Willis) happy, and all of a sudden, her change as her world on the tennis court is taken away from her is majorly disturbing. As Ross realizes what is going on, you know it is only a matter of time before she will be in danger of being one of the walking dead. The shot of all the hat-clad beauties walking through a grocery store politely greeting each other towards the end is one of those classic moments in film that will stick in your film memory and can be best described as being shot almost ballet-like. Bryan Forbes, the cult director of many British classics, almost totally delivers, but the eternal quiet for the viewer, like the town of Stepford is for Ross, will sometimes make for a difficult film to fully concentrate on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE STEPFORD WIVES isn't much different from another Ira Levin adaptation, ROSEMARY'S BABY. Only you turn a struggling actor's na?ve wife into a savvy feminist-leaning photographer married to a contented lawyer, both ditching city life for a quaint Connecticut town called Stepford.Like Mia Farrow's Rosemary, Katharine Ross is a natural beauty and, as Joanna Eberhart, she gets lost in a mysterious predicament ? although she catches on pretty quick. Unlike Rosemary, Joanna already has two kids and her life pretty much mapped out? Actually, her stale husband Walter has done that already?Within minutes upon entering the pearly Stepford gates, our heroine has doubts about this rural location, especially after realizing how strange the residents are. And that's the first of several problems?The suspense is hindered within the first ten minutes after Walter meets the most surreal wife of the lot ? the rabbit of this Pollyanna/Wonderland. Nanette Newman as Carol Van Sant, with ghostly hollowed eyes and the steely countenance of a, well, robot? is a character that could have kept us in the dark a lot longer... But she's much too bizarre, way too soon.To counterbalance the kitchen-set wives, all seeming straight out of a detergent ad, is intentional scene-stealer Paula Prentiss as Joanna's sidekick Bobbie, a liberal smart aleck providing bubbly insight and exposition. Unfortunately, Bobbie also gives Joanna, who should have had more of a roguish desperation throughout, a much too cushy safety net.The best scenes occur within the introduction of each housewife. Although they're quite similar, each is unique and gorgeous in their own way, married to dull, plain looking husbands, part of a makeshift Men's Club that doesn't allow women...This sparks subtle outrage within Joanna and, at the point where she investigates possible reasons for the town's strange behavior, the film seems like it's rushing for a conclusion, albeit a predictable (and at this point, famously iconic) one?The Noirish nighttime climax, when Joanna finally invades the "hornet's nest," is fitfully spooky, reminiscent of THE TWILIGHT ZONE. But it's the eerie epilogue ? as each housewife strolls through a bright lit supermarket ? that truly defines THE STEPFORD WIVES: perhaps more time should have been spent there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walter and Joanna Eberhart up sticks and move to tranquil Stepford in Connecticut. Initially forgiving at just how subservient the women folk are to their husbands, Joanna soon begins to believe a mass male conspiracy is afoot in the town. A belief that is further emphasised when her best friend suddenly changes and becomes a "Stepford Wife".Ira Levin was a fine writer, in his armoury you will find A Kiss Before Dying, Rosemary's Baby, The Boys from Brazil and this paranoid horror satire, The Stepford Wives. Yet although this 1975 adaptation (it was remade badly as a comedy in 2004) captures the essence and bad taste chauvinistic subjugation of women, it's ponderously paced to within an inch of its life for the first three quarters. So much so that when the excellent finale comes, it's a miracle if one is actually still awake! However, the film does reward your patience, the high points far outweighing the low points. Cheeky slices of humour help to emphasise Levin's satirical bent, and the chill factor in that final quarter more than does enough to warrant it being planted in the science fiction genre. But from the director of Whistle Down the Wind (Bryan Forbes) and the screenplay writer of Marathon Man &amp; All the President's Men (William Goldman), one surely had the right to expect Levin's novel to get the exciting adaptation it deserved? It didn't, and that remains a huge disappointment to this very day. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry to the fans of this film but it just doesn't measure up to it's reputation. Surely this isn't Goldman's screenplay......not with the meandering dialogue that appears to be ad-libbed half the time.....and not very well at that. The beautiful Katherine Ross appears to think she is is another film and Paula Prentiss is a disaster trying to be "hip" and "with it" as they used to say in the 70's. I like both these actresses but they are either horribly miscast, didn't want to be in this film, or are suffering from a lapse in judgement.It all appears so amateurish, so disjointed and frankly silly. The premise is good but transferring the book to film just didn't work. None of the characters are likable, even before the "transfer" takes place with the exception of Tina Louise, who is believably feisty and her own woman. But her character is so secondary to the plot that she is never given much screen time. The male characters are so ludicrous and unattractive that it makes sense that the women have to be "robotosized". This film left me with one unanswered question: where the hell did those women find those clothes!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is this movie about anyway?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a movie that has feminism as the underlying premise, it doesn't do a very good job of promoting any revolutionary thoughts except ones into better rules for book to movie adaptations. I went into this movie without any notion of what it could be about and was uncomfortably unsure of this until the unexpected twist of an ending. The first hour and a half or so left me wanting to turn it off except for the ambiguous forshadowing that didn't allow for me to suppose what could happen but instead left me bewildered and ansy. Like when the woman got in the car accident in the parking lot. This type of forshadowing left out the main reason for the technique, which is to cleverly hint at a further event with small clues. The way this and many other scenes where carried out had hints that were too enigmatic and simply left me bored. This boredom carried throughout the movie as all of the dialogue and character interactions had no substance pertaing to the end of the movie, which is the real motive behind it. Joanna (Katherine Ross) and Bobbies'(Paula Prentiss) friendship didn't seem like a feminine power movement but more like a sharing of interests, and in the scenes where the director tried to show their bond it ended up looking more like a tampon commercial. As I was dragged towards the climax my disapointment came to a head as the movie turned from a film with no interesting dialogue or cinematography into a worse than usual B rate sci-fi flick. This is also the only place that has any notion of the state of womans' rights at the time. But instead of any impowerment, they are defeated without a struggle by the army of fat, bald, sweaty men that for whatever reason aren't satisfied by the fact that they already have beautiful wives that they couldn't get in reality. The fact that this movie is being remade is an out of date atrocity because it wasn't even relevant, intriguing, or shocking in its time, and it won't be this time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Housewives as robots...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ira Levin's story of a diabolical plot to turn housewives into robots is made into a mild film by director Bryan Forbes. Katherine Ross moves to a sleepy Connecticut town only to find that the men, who meet every night, are turning their wives into drones who do nothing but serve them &amp; do housework. Oddly, despite the horrific premise, there's nary a thrill in this snail paced film. Ross brings a lot of pepper to her role and she's ably supported by the likes of Peter Masterson, Tina Louise, Nanette Newman and, best of all, Paula Prentiss. Prentiss is very lively as Ross's kooky friend. It's unfortunate that this very sunny film is not scary in the slightest; it's just dull. Owen Roizman's cinematography is terrific but there's not much else to recommend.</fullReview>

The provocative and disturbing subject matter is turned into a host of tacky costumes, awkward dialogue, and terrible acting, particularly by Katherine Ross. Her discovering of her robot double about to kill her is pathetic. It seemed as if the director couldn't get a better cast (there is a Ruth Gordon look-a-like in the supporting role who was a popular actress at the time) with the exception of Paula Prentice who has the most fun role. A similar fate occurs with a movie on the similar topic, Handsmaid Tale, but this is much more fun, even if the directing and cinematography are often poor.

		<fullReview>The Stepford Wives starts as photographer Joanna (Katherine Ross) &amp; her lawyer husband Walter Eberhart (Peter Masterson) along with their two young children arrive at their new home in the small town of Stepford having decided to move away from the hassles of big city life in New York. Stepford seems perfect, it seems like the ideal place to live &amp; raise a family but Joanna starts to have doubts about it. Everything in Stepford seems almost too perfect, Joanna befriends Bobbie (Paula Prentiss) who also has her suspicions about Stepford &amp; the people who live there. Joanna's husband Walter joins the local Men's Association &amp; begins to change while Bobbie also completely changes after spending a weekend away with her husband, Joanna investigates the mystery &amp; discovers a shocking truth...Directed by Bryan Forbes this was the first filmed adaptation of the novel of the same name by Ira Levin whose literary work include the source novels for various films such as Rosemary's Baby (1968), The Boys from Brazil (1978), Deathtrap (1982) &amp; Sliver (1992) although the final script was written by William Goldman who himself has quite a resume including script's for All the President's men (1976), Marathon Man (1976), The Princess Bride (1987), Misery (1990), Maverick (1994) &amp; The General's Daughter (1999) amongst other's. While watching The Stepford Wives I couldn't help but feel underwhelmed &amp; a little let down, the potential is here for a terrific thriller with a dark satirical edge that could have been very effective but The Stepford Wives just never gets going &amp; never fully explores it's themes or ideas. The idea of men killing their moaning wives &amp; replacing them with perfect obedient robots is great but how are these robots made? Who makes them? What happens to the women they are set to impersonate? Why were that robots eye's black at the end? Why do so many men let their wives be replaced with robots? Has no-one ever gone to the authorities? Surely the robots wouldn't age? Nothing is explained in a very rushed &amp; unsatisfying climax which left me wondering why I had bothered sitting through almost two hours of it to get absolutely nowhere. The logistics of the story are just absurd, none of it ever feels plausible or well thought out &amp; even the satire is dry, bland &amp; underwhelming. The attempt to make a social point about American idealism as the male chauvinist's are shown sexist pigs while the women are portrayed as nothing more than objects to cook &amp; clean don't quite work either, it's all so tame &amp; pleasant &amp; nowhere near dark enough &amp; the fact that the script takes itself so seriously doesn't help what is essentially a very silly sci-fi thriller anyway.Over the years writer William Goldman has never hid his dislike of the finished film &amp; has criticised director Forbes in particular who threw out his original concepts of picture perfect dolly birds in mini skirts &amp; replaced it with boring middle aged women wearing long dresses &amp; large hats. The Stepford Wives has dated, the issues &amp; themes are from a bygone era &amp; aren't as easy to relate to these days, in fact I was amazed at the scene in which Joanna tells her husband Walter about their neighbours kissing in the garden (in early morning no less!) with a surprising level of outrage. There's no violence to speak of &amp; while there may be one or two moments which resemble a horror film The Stepford Wives doesn't go for scares.Filmed mainly in Connecticut this wasn't particularly successful at the box-office &amp; you can maybe see why, I don't think it's a film with mass appeal or much replay value. The acting is alright, I can't say I thought anyone was particularly great but no-one was particularly bad either.The Stepford Wives tries to be a creepy sci-fi thriller &amp; make a sweeping social statement about stereotypical American life &amp; sexism but it just all ends up being rather dull &amp; uninspired, I can't say i liked it that much myself. Followed by three made for television sequels Revenge of the Stepford Wives (1980), The Stepford Children (1987) &amp; The Stepford Husbands (1996) before being remade as The Stepford Wives (2004) starring Nicole Kidman, Bette Midler &amp; Glen Close no less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not all male fantasies are of a strictly sexual nature, as this story shows. However, if you think that this was the point Levin was trying to make with his ultra-pro-feminist novel, think again.TSW is laced/peppered with feminist propaganda. Even the ending has silly symbolism in it: Ross sacrificing her only chance of saving her life by searching for her children; this, for Levin, symbolizes real-life women who sacrifice their careers in order to have kids and a family. There are many other examples. Several reviewers here stated that Levin must have been a women-hater. In fact, for those who actually pay attention to movies when they watch them, it should be crystal-clear that Levin wrote a feminist novel. One of the many proofs of this is that the only likable characters in Stepford are the women. It's sort of hilarious that someone would actually even consider, let alone go through with, writing/making a sci-fi movie with a feminist agenda! That sort of reminds me of Ed Wood using the B-movie world to promote his passion for transvestism. Which brings me to the motives that a man might have to become a willing instrument of the ultra-feminist cause: perhaps, just like Phil Donahue, this was a way for Ira to score more women, huh? Sometimes behind seemingly idealistic people are motives that are far less than noble...Coe: "Isn't this kind of like blackmail, Joanne...?" Ross: "It's what made this country great, Claude." Now, Ross's idiotic riposte may sound clever and sharp at first glance to those who hate America (especially Capitalism of any sort), but on closer inspection it is just empty gobbledygook. America was founded on blackmail?? Just exactly how does that work? How can ANY country be founded on blackmail? I'm sure that Lenin, Sean Penn, and the Human Rights Watch would agree, but then they would, wouldn't they...Prentiss, half-way through the movie, comes up with a cockamamie theory that "a tranquilizing chemical" is being dumped into the Stepford water system, which causes all the women to become so placid. There is only one "tiny" problem with this idea: WHY AREN'T THE MEN PLACID, TOO?? Either Levin thinks that men and women are so biologically different that they'd react differently to tempered-with water (which would be in stark contradiction to his feminist notion that the sexes are EXACTLY the same), or he is telling us - quite unintentionally, I'm sure - that both Prentiss and Ross are, in fact, morons: Prentiss, for not realizing the obvious flaw in the laughable conspiracy theory she concocted, and Ross for sheepishly going along with it. (Female logic...) Hence I have no choice but to conclude that perhaps the android versions of these two women may actually be improvements on them. No wonder their men had them switched: keep the body, switch the brain off - every man's clandestine dream come true!To further investigate Prentiss's cretinous suspicion, Thelma and Louise go to Ross's ex, a scientist, who'll help them find out whether the water is safe or not: Prentiss: "The women in Stepford LOVE housework, so I thought there might be something in the water..." Ross's Ex: "... Where did you find HER?" A very funny scene. The writer of TSW (Goldman, who gave us such left-wing scripts as "A Few Good Men", "Marathon Man", "Chaplin"...) may not have been aware of it but Prentiss's attitude here neatly sums up all the narrow-mindedness, inflexibility in thought, and the arrogant, dogmatic zeal which infests most modern-day women's lib organizations. Modern feminists are staunch opponents of ANY woman being a housewife or making her own choices regarding matters such as career or children - i.e. life in general. THEIR life. Like any extremists, the feminists do not promote choice: they promote only ONE lifestyle (career/independence), and any woman that disagrees with this is immediately dismissed as a cretin, a heretic, or as "a traitor to our cause". There is really not much left to liberate female-wise in the West, hence the feminists have degenerated toward embracing left-wing radicalism - which, I might add, is just as anti-female as the extreme Right. What happened to the women's lib movement in the West is akin to the evolution (or devolution) of unions/syndicates: at the start there were genuine reasons for their existence, but once they achieved (most of) their goals they had nowhere to go but seek out political extremism (feminists) and criminal activities (unions). It's like the police force suddenly one day waking up to a world devoid of crime. What will they do? Disband? Remember: every highly idealistic, (initially) noble(?) social, political or religious movement eventually decays morally.Tina Louise: "The only competition left (in tennis) are two teenage boys with permanent erections." Prentiss: "Send them to MY place!" Tina L.: "Are you kidding! I'd be lost without them..." Is it possible that whoever wrote this didn't realize the perverted implications in the last sentence?... Well, no-one ever said feminists (male or female) were particularly bright...Prentiss and Ross look very silly together, not quite a "power couple" like Thelma and Louise. (Well, actually, Thelma and Louise also die at the end.) Not only do they fail to save their hides, but Prentiss is about a full head taller than Ross, towering over her as if she were her basketball-playing boyfriend or something. Ross is okay in her role, but Prentiss is very annoying: someone compared her to Geena Davis (Thelma?), and they're absolutely right. Both of these women are sub-par in every way.Just like feminists chose to worship Marx, I chose to view TSW as an uplifting fantasy. Was that supposed to be a downer ending? I'm not so sure... I'm against the murders, of course, but there is something to be said about the men of Stepford and their little world...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy premise but fatally slow moving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess the premise of The Stepford Wives holds up pretty well today and it must have been quite edgy back when it was released.The wives in Stepford have one thing in common; they're all perfect housewives. Their main objective in life is to please their husbands, clean the house, bake and take care of the children. Life couldn't be better...but wait, could something be wrong with this picture perfect image? Are these women being transformed by someone? Who would want to do this kind of thing?Yeah, men are bastards! I guess the point this film is making could still be valid in a lot of households. There probably are men who would like nothing better than to have their wives be their servants and fulfill their every need, and they'd jump at the chance to make it happen a.s.a.p.But, talking about the film, the premise is pretty creepy. Seeing these lively and spirited women being transformed into mere robots of their husbands desires are images not easily forgotten. That final shot of Ross sends chill down my spines. But sadly; the film is incredibly slow moving with a conclusion that's all too silly (I mean you know they're doing it, but it's how they do it that's beyond me, a better conclusion could have been found). Pacing kills every momentum here, apart from a couple of scenes perhaps, this really should have been tightened somewhat.All in all; The Stepford Wives has it's moments, a good basic story and a chilling ending. You could do a lot worse.</fullReview>

It's ultra slow pace comes across as insulting to the viewer's intelligence, as if we need to slowly figure out what's going on. For example, at the end, when Katherine Ross see's her black-eyed double, the camera pans around very slowly to show the robot-babe. If Rod Serling were in charge, the camera would've whipped around with a loud sound effect that would've made your heart skip a beat. It is definately a classic, however, especially since the term "Stepford Wife" remains in our lexicon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't carry on about this flick because it isn't worth it. Yet it's fascinating to watch, like slowly driving past a highway accident in which heads are separated from bodies. I can't think of where to begin in describing this flick. The premise is that men are so irritated with their individuated wives that they have them killed and replaced by buxom robots. How did someone as supposedly talented as Katherine Ross -- she takes trite pictures of children at play -- become attracted to such a nerd? What's wrong with keeping a kitchen clean? (I don't do it myself, but stil....) How can you improve upon Paula Prentiss's bosom? Why does the film, towards the end, switch from Ross as the threatened victim to her husband (an ominously opened door.). The Stepford Wives show us the wive's point of view. When do we get a sociological interpretation? In which women are into "consciousness raising" because their husbands are bringing home sufficient bacon for them to have all sorts of appliances, and at this level of socioeconomic status, servants. Of course they feel bored and left out. Who wouldn't? With so little to do? Another spin on the narrative would have the men out working every day and bringing home the paycheck for women to spend, a kind of slave-master relationship.Of course women have been denigrated and mistreated over the years. The interpretation of that treatment is not so easily come by. They didn't get the vote until 1920. But at that time politics was considered a "dirty business." Women were placed on a pedastel, too good to get their hands dirty. All of which is fine. They should, in my humble opinion, be fully integrated into daily life. The same is true for all minorities, although women form a majority in our age structure. The price to be paid for that integration is public criticism. Once you stake a claim to public power, then your attitudes are subject to public scrutiny. It doesn't matter what your gender or race is. This movie is pandering to the public tastes at the time. It's kind of like our attitude currently towards other nations. Tremble and obey, as the Chinese emporer once put it, or be extinguished. How silly. If we couldn't negotiate an answer to social problems, we would be in even worse trouble than we already are, which is pretty bad.The acting is adequate. The photography is good. The conception, the direction, the story -- they're all execrable. Watch it if you can. It's a great lesson in digital thinking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DVD issue of The Stepford Wives does not work in U.S. DVD players</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have purchased this item twice, once from Borders and once from an online DVD seller. Neither time would the DVD play in my machine or anyone else's machine I tried. Since my DVD player has never before rejected ANY DVD product, including poorly kept rentals, I must assume that the entire issue of this item is flawed.Has anyone else experienced this? Has the DVD worked for anyone else?I am surprized I have not seen any other reports on this problem.I have also reported this to Amazon, but they seem unwilling to show it.</fullReview>
