		<shortDescription>As Bad As It Gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a perfect example of what is wrong with the state of movies today. The original was a gem, with excellent acting by Katharine Ross, Paula Prentiss, and Patrick O'Neal. It was part horror story, part feminist cautionary tale. Most of all, it was BELIEVABLE! You got the feeling these were real people, and that all this could really be happening--and with a minimum of "special effects". The dialogue was pretty intelligent, the plot twists weren't given away in the first 15 minutes, and the ending was a real shocker. You cared about the female characters in the movie--you cared about Joanna's plight, and rooted for her to escape her planned fate.The current version could only--and was probably meant to--appeal to the lowest common denominator of movie-goer. In this film, the women are just as bad as the men--you don't give a damn what happens to them; that's how annoying the characters are. The laughs are cheap and lowbrow, vital plot elements of Ira Levin's novel are missing, and the acting is just plain bad.You know what? I'm getting annoyed just writing about this dreck. If you have any taste, any sense, any feeling for good films, any aversion to wasting good money on bad movies--stay far away from this one!! See the original, and appreciate the stunning subtlety of a thinking person's movie, well-made and well-acted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Stepford Wives (2004)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found out they were doing a remake of "The Stepford Wives" while surfing on IMDb.com, and when I saw the cast, I was intrigued at what an eclectic bunch they had assembled...Nicole Kidman, Glenn Close, Christopher Walken, Matthew Broderick, Bette Midler, John Lovitz (huh?), and Faith Hill (double, huh?). Given that Lovitz and Midler were in the mix, I could only assume that they were going to give it a comedic horror edge...interesting, I thought. This didn't make me rush to the theater and be the first one in line on opening day, mind you, but, I did find the prospect interesting. Well, this is proof positive that a great cast doesn't a wonderful movie make, and that classics should never be at best remade, and at the very least "tweaked" and remade.On a recent trip to San Francisco, and with a 5:00 am flight the next day, I thought the best way to spend my final evening is catching up on all those films I didn't see in the cinema. "The Stepford Wives" was available on the hotel movie list, so I thought, "Why not?" When the very first scene involved a "reality TV" exec (Kidman) launching proposed new shows, complete with a Meredith Viera cameo, I knew I was in for an odd night. Still undaunted, I continued watching. What followed was one of the most over-hyped, ludicrous, inconsistent, and down right stupid hour and forty five minutes I've ever wasted. It wasn't funny. It wasn't scary. It wasn't even "Mommie Dearest"-let's-treat-it-as-camp-bad. It wasn't necessary.Kidman creates one of the most boring and unimaginative characters in recent memory. It just leads me to believe that, Oscar win for "The Hours" or not, the jury is still out on her. Matthew Broderick is completely wasted as her mousey husband who packs the family up and moves them to Stepford. Bette Midler plays the bawdy feminist author with wisecracking husband (John Lovitz) in tow. I can only imagine that the writers thought that their appearance on the screen would be funny enough because NOTHING they said could make me crack a smile. A little bit of John Lovitz goes a long way. You had the token gay couple present, updating "Stepford" to the 21st century...Log Cabin paired with flaming queen...how funny...twenty years ago. If you blinked, you'd have missed Faith Hill. Given this was her big on screen debut, maybe we should just consider her lack of dialogue a gift. Christopher Walken must have an outstanding debt with the studio that produced this disaster...that's the only logical explanation that justifies his presence at all. And Glenn Close...talented and old reliable, Glenn Close...if there is a notable performance in this idea gone awry, it's hers. But, even her quirky performance turns embarrassing when this train wreck finally winds down.Which leads me to the biggest problem I have...its inconsistency. Are they robots, or are they women with a chip in their head? One simple way to avoid this problem is PICK ONE OR THE OTHER. Don't have a woman spit out money from her mouth like an ATM, or have Faith Hill "blow a fuse" with sparks flying out of her ears in one scene, then follow it with a simple "off" switch making them all normal again. Even with the largest suspension of disbelief available, this is an amateurish plot error that stands out like a Southern Baptist at a bar Mitzvah. It's almost as if they had them be normal at the end because test audiences didn't want to deal with the fact that Bette Midler wasn't going to have anymore screen time once she blew up. It was horrible, and an insult to even the most casual of moviegoers.I suppose that Hollywood has come to the conclusion that if the cast is big enough, you can feed them whatever trail of dog sick you like once the audience has bought their ticket and sat down. If this is the new trend, then do us all a favor...leave the classics alone. Fire your "writers" and hire a chimpanzee to write the scripts...at least they work for bananas--meaning the price of admission might go down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, Semi-comic Setup which Makes an Awful Left-turn.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that the book actually has a comic undertone indicates that even when the feminism of the story has dated badly, it could be done quite well as a wicked, even mean-spirited black comedy of sorts. As a matter of fact, the great opening montage with its Danny Elfman-like music and portraits of women in the 50s suggests this is exactly what it is aiming for: skewering American complacency, Ozzie and Harriet, and the notion of the Perfect Wife.For the first hour, we're swiftly introduced to Joanna Eberhart (Nicole Kidman, channeling Faye Dunaway from NETWORK and brilliant at the moment she gets canned from her network for having gone too far with her reality shows) and Walter Kresby (Matthew Broderick, emasculated but not as mean as the novel's version), Bobbie and David Markowitz (Bette Midler, her usual loud self and true to the novel's depiction of the character and Jon Lovitz, also emasculated, a little underwritten), and a gay couple, Roger Bannister (Roger Bart, flamboyant and catty, almost walking away with the movie) and Jerry Harmon (David Marshall Grant, appropriately subdued). We also get to meet the Stepford residents, of which Claire Wellington (Glenn Close) stands out as she maniacally tosses around her 1950s uber-femininity as if her life depends on it and nearly comes off as a drag queen. Claire is married to Mike Wellington (Christopher Walken, playing himself as usual). Other residents include Faith Hill in a small but funny part as a Stepford wife who seems to malfunction quite a bit. This quasi black comedy of manners works well for its setup.Until the 60 minute mark.It's then that everything that made the novel work falls apart. Logic goes out the window, the plot supposedly becomes a mystery, and then magically there's a twist at the climactic moment which is only there to please a crowd of people who would not accept the original, ironic ending and one whom no one would have seen coming. When you cop out so openly as this movie does (you can actually feel the exact moment when the story, so far good, punches out and goes into autopilot) you're insulting the public's intelligence. And that's not a good thing to do. It just indicates a high level of laziness usually reserved for cheap exploitation movies or dumbed-down franchise sequels, not for something as high-profile as this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ultra modern reworking of Ira Levin's bestseller from the 1970s (and the 1975 film counterpart starring Katharine Ross) about Connecticut suburb filled with perky, beautiful housewives and their boorish, piggy husbands. Nicole Kidman is very good as the newcomer in town whose husband (a rather stolid Matthew Broderick) immediately joins the Men's Association. Abandoning the sly dark humor of the original movie, this rather bombastic--and brief--92 minute version shows heavy signs of post-production tinkering. There are all sorts of things wrong with this movie, starting with the obvious hedging-of-bets pertaining to the mystery behind the wives (which might've been wildly successful if the filmmakers had just stuck to their original vision); Kidman's children disappear at camp, are brought home (off-camera), and then disappear again; one Stepford bunny coughs up money--exactly how is this done according to Christopher Walken's "home movie" near the finish? But the worst is saved for last, when an outlandish twist leads to the kind of teeth-grinding, Larry King-cameoed ending that undermines director Frank Oz's ability to even work on a movie much less direct one. Some of the cartoonish humor (though over-the-top) is entertaining and colorful, and the movie's first 45 minutes are good, but the thicker the plot gets, the more ridiculous the film becomes. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film made by a focus group, rather than anyone artistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Standing alongside The Wicker Man as the worst remake ever this really is a pile of utter nonsense. The original had a good story to tell but this one is just a joke.Nicole Kidman would seem to be the perfect choice for a robotic woman, I've never seen her show any emotions whatsoever. You can't really blame the cast, the script is so poor that even the best actor would struggle to convey any meaning in their lines.The studio weren't too happy with the downbeat ending so ordered a change, and then another, and then another. This ensured that this movie has a happy smiley ending and the fact that it makes NO SENSE whatsoever didn't seem to worry them because in their minds we the viewers are basically vegetables that just need to be exposed to some flickering images for about an hour and a half.An entire army of producers cut this one up and made an absolute mess of it, it's barely even a proper film let alone a coherent story. You know what's really frightening though? It still gets a 5 star rating (at the time of writing) so most people think this trash is average.Even for bad movie fans there's just nothing to enjoy, the whole film is atrocious and the fact that it is a remake of a good film just plunges the knife in deeper. Deserves a spot in the bottom 100.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3/10 Awful! Bad editing, no continuity, and Broderick can't act.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I despise this movie. Most bad movies I simply dislike. Plot: Interesting concept, could have been fruitful, but wasn't. Script: There were two funny scenes, the rest was boring. For the record though, the audience (though not many in number) seemed to laugh a lot. Generally, the script was passable. Still, after the first half, every minute seemed like five to me. Acting: Broderick and Close really didn't do a good job. It was just sub-standard for a professional actor. Editing: I could actually see where they had cut some scenes together. You know, where a person is standing still and their image suddenly shifts sideways. Now, for the real kicker, the one thing that gets my blood hot. Continuity: This movie committed one of the unforgivable sins of the big screen: Mutually Exclusive Realities. Without providing spoilers, I'll say that the movie entertained one reality for the purpose of the body of the film, and changed that reality for the convenience of the end of the film. This was the cherry on the sundae. Oh my. It was so bad. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an awful flop!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I very rarely write comments here about films I didn't enjoy but this is different. This film boasts a cast that will be pulling people in cinemas. My advice is: don't bother. It's just the most boring, predictable, badly planned and executed piece of celluloid I've ever seen. It's as if Frank Oz had a good idea but got bored half-way through realising it. I haven't seen the original but surely the actors who got involved in this read the script of the remake? They can't have based their participation on the Seventies film, surely. Because the 2004 remake is full of awful cliches, bad jokes (OK, there are a couple of good lines but that's about it) and it is so empty of ideas that it makes you want to shout to the screen. If the actors playing in this film were unknowns there is NO WAY anyone would have gone to see it. It's just a parade of famous names (some good actors, some average) that sleepwalk through a dreadful script. It can't even become a cult classic - it's THAT average. 1/10 for me and that's being lenient.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie has so many levels...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...on which it fails. (MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD)The story: It makes absolutely no sense (as some others have pointed out, this is due to the re shooting of the end to make it more palatable to the average sissy audience). But I realize that if they had tried to stay conform with the new ending then they would have to take out ALL the visual gags. Now, I am not a huge fan of making everything air-tight logical, but what they wanted the audience to swallow here in contradictions makes star wars seem like a factual documentary in comparison. So why make a write off even more of a write off by adding a non-fit ending? I don't know. What can you do when the story falls apart? In what types of movies can you just sit back an ignore logic errors? A screwball comedy? A kill-fest? A psycho-nightmare? A super hero movie? None of these surface, so we are stuck with a terribly written movie (that had an ultra-thin story to begin with) trying to take itself seriously.The humour: There was barely any. A shot at AOL here, and pun on Microsoft there. A bit of over-the-top depiction of a conservative's wet dream. Not nearly enough to make this a 'fun' picture.The suspense: There is none. The entire story is evident after the 'square dance scene' (15 minutes into the picture) - and I hadn't seen any trailers nor the original. BTW: That isn't square dance what they are doing - but I digress (I was young, I needed the money ;-) ). Actors: Bette Middler did surprisingly well. Although she usually gets on my nerves she plays an attitude similar to her role in 'ruthless people' -something which suits her. All others looked bored out of their skulls. Kidman? Lets not go there. She's just not an actress. How she ever got a leading role I'll never understand. Brodderick has had better days, as had Loviz. Glen Close? I almost felt sorry for her, having to deliver that totally contrived ending monologue full of contradictions. I have to applaud her for getting A MILLION VOLTS THROUGH HER LIPS AND NOT EVEN A SMUDGE MARK TO SHOW FOR IT. The 'plan' she has does exactly the opposite of what she wanted to do from the very start. Sheesh, They must have fired the continuity guy/girl after the first day and forgotten to refill the job. Walken? He was OK, but I have seen him MUCH better. I hope he loses that 'I shat my pants'-walk. It looks like Jack Palance in his last movies. Maybe it's the same medical condition?The computer graphics: Texture mapped boxes without shadows or depth as houses? Puhleeese. I could do better on my laptop in half an hour. The robot-dog looked ridiculous.Resume: 2 out of 10 (because I actually sat through it. The movie DOES hat a good point going for it! At 93 minutes it is mercifully short.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timely Theme, Mishandled and Manhandled!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ira Levin's cautionary novel, "The Stepford Wives", was a fascinating fable of the ultimate male backlash to feminism; in 1975, director Bryan Forbes turned the novel into a chilling variation of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers", as innocent wives are substituted by zombie-like robots, their husbands bonding in a smugly evil male cult. Unsettling and ambiguous, the fate of the actual women is left to the viewer's imagination, making it far more frightening than a pat resolution would have been.This concept was apparently lost on Paramount, DreamWorks, and Frank Oz, who wavered between camp and black comedy heavy-handedness, in this 2004 remake. Scripted by Paul Rudnick, the women are no longer normal, sympathetic wives, but high-powered execs, with apparent agendas against men, and husbands little more than doorstops. Their fate, to become blond-haired sex-slave bimbos locked in 'June Cleever' mode, while their idiot spouses adjust their breast sizes by remote control, and swap the wives for favors, demeans both men and women, and even offers an out-of-place jab at homosexuals, as a funny gay spouse is turned into a right-wing religious zealot politician (how an openly gay couple would ever be even allowed in this community is ignored).While spoofing the earlier film isn't, in itself, a bad idea, no one involved in this project apparently had a clear vision of what they were aiming at, so continuity and logic are sadly missing. As other critics have rightly noted, the status of the wives waivers between being robots and being micro-chipped and brainwashed humans, making the Nicole Kidman 'template' body, and finale 'revelation' of community leader Christopher Walken's actual status as ridiculous as an ATM-spewing wife, and remote controls to adjust emotional responses and breast sizes, labeled, conveniently, with each wife's name. All the pretty, golden-hued settings, and Matthew Broderick's emergence as a 'good guy with a heart' who saves the day can't compensate for the quagmire of a plot. The real shame of it all is that the potential for a good film hovers over the proceedings, just out of reach, and some really fine performances are all for naught. Glenn Close gives a strangely sympathetic twist to the film's villain, Walken is the most engaging (and youthful) he's been in years, Bette Midler and Roger Bart are both hilarious, Jon Lovitz is at his silly best, and Nicole Kidman again proves herself more than adept at comedy, and portraying American women. Matthew Broderick seems to be making a career of playing milquetoast males (Ferris Bueller, where are you?), and for 'eye and ear candy', nothing can quite match Country music sex symbol Faith Hill's orgasmic moans, and cup-size changes. All this, lost in a truly misguided film. What a waste!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too lightweight for its subject matter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original film, and the great novel that preceded it are worthy of a better treatment than this lighthearted, anti-suspenseful, Hollywood variety show. What's more, the excellent veteran cast, the catchy soundtrack and the expensive production values could have made this into the socially serious, poignant and yet funny contemporary masterwork it should have been. Instead, we are left with a film whose campiest moments are clichés and whose point seems to be love conquers all - even the sexism, genderism and masculocentrism still rampant in American Society today! I never expect comedies to do a particularly good job with continuity and logic, but some of the continuity problems in this film are really pretty amazing. Plot twists are, after all, supposed to change the COURSE of the plot, not its basic premises. I'm dying to tell you about it, but I won't write a spoiler.Here are the basics: Nicole Kidman and Matthew Broderick are a successful couple whose marriage has been suffering a bit because of the stress of their work-lives. Nicole, a TV executive famous for post-feminist male-bashing shows gets fired for no particular reason and they couple decides to move away to Stepford, an exclusive community populated by people who seem to have no particular troubles of any kind, or even jobs for that matter. Some of the first things Matthew Broderick realizes about Stepford is that all of the women are beautiful, and everybody is marvelously happy with a few possible exceptions - his own wife, Bette Midler and a gay liberal whose partner has been sucked into republicanism. Predictably, these three conspire to resist the happiness all around them and investigate the mystery of the Stepford men's club.I've described the first quarter of the film. Although the central plot is interesting and strong, the lack of even a shred of seriousness detracts very heavily from it - even from a comedic point of view. If this film hadn't made me disinterested, the feminist in me would have simply been angry over the missed opportunity this film represents. Moreover, it is possible to see this film as a justification of the 'blame the victim' mentality so often prevalent in contemporary culture.Most of the cast seems equally unengaged. They sometimes seem to be playing roles in different films - interacting with each other poorly and playing their roles with no particular goal in mind. I can only fault the director here. Broderick and Kidman are, as usual, very watchable, but even Nicole seems to be unsure what her character is supposed to be portraying at times. Bette Midler is fine, as are Walken and Glenn Close. Close was actually, IMO, the show stealer - making the film tolerable with her excruciatingly irritating and very dominant presence.While not a complete travesty, I can not recommend The Stepford Wives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original was chilling and fascinating, and the main complaint one could have about it is that the production values were kind of low and so clearly 70's-dated. A remake was a great idea (so many times... not so much).And they wasted it... squandered it, with this piece of "who cares" garbage. No point of view, no consistency in commentary on what women do to themselves in general/men's expectations of women, and worst sin of all... for all the gazillion dollars, and gazillion hours of effort this movie had to have absorbed... it denies its own reality. Too many instances to name, but the worst offender is it couldn't even decide if the wives were killed and turned into robots, or if they were altered by a chip that could then be reversed so you could tack on the b.s. "happy ending" that was tacked onto this film. All the effort that went into making Nicole Kidman's character's replica, and all the camera time given to the creepy image -- both in the film and in the trailers... and the replica clearly wouldn't have been used according to the rules of the universe within the film, so why have it? Sorry for the spoiler, but this !@#$*&amp;*&amp;&amp;*)( film is already spoiled. And it reeks. I'll never get those two hours of my life back again. God, a remake could have been so cool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard Nicole Kidman was to appear in a remake of the seminal socio-horror flick, The Stepford Wives, I thought: what a fabulous idea. She was wonderful in The Others, after all. Then came the reviews - universally bad. Still I was curious enough to watch it. I will never get that 90 minutes of my life back again. But it's worse for Nicole, she could have been off making a decent film elsewhere during the months she must have spent on this pap. What was she thinking? A film that stinks. Yes, stinks. This retelling of the original takes liberties with the plot that are nothing short of idiotic. It all adds up to a senseless mess.It's a good job it flopped. The next move would probably have involved Julianne Moore in a "hilarious" remake of Rosemary's Baby - where the baby turned out to be the baby Jesus.If I could give it no stars, I would.</fullReview>

(Over the head, with a lame, illogical, apparently 30 page script.) This film is sooo bad. The cast is uniformly awful(Glenn Close does score some points as a maniacal June Cleaver type and Roger Bart is cute, but enough with the queen thing!) Even Bette Midler &amp; Christopher Walken are boring. If Nicole Kidman had tilted her head and arched that eyebrow one more time, I would've screamed. (She is pretty creepy in the transformation reveal scene, but she sort of always creeps me out anyhow. Not that I don't like that.) To top off the nausea factor, there's the oh-so-unsubtle relating of Republican patriotism &amp; "family values" to Stepfordish robotism. How original for liberal Hollywood!! Aren't they being clever!! (Hey, I'm a Libertarian, no skin off my nose, just off my finger as I tried to fast forward through that awful campaign scene.) I'm not even going to touch the whole "are they robots or is it a brain chip?" debacle that has been hashed to pieces here already. It was just a convenient "out" for a lazy writer who wanted a new &amp; 'cute' ending. So all the hotshot husbands are at the grocery...har, har, har...gag.</fullReview>

The point was to make people think "Do men really want their wives to just be gorgeous slaves with no real interests?" Also, the fact that they actually kill the wives makes it even creepier. This movie had none of that, and it didn't make any sense. The women in this film were supposed to just have been made over with brain chips in them right?

It was also artfully done and everything in it was beautiful. In my opinion, it's underrated. Whoever played the gay guy was great and Bette Midler did a great job, too. I thought those two were the funniest. Sure, there really was no need for a remake, but the makers did a great job, anyway? I like how they made the remake into a comedy, instead of a horror film like the original. However, I thought the ending was weak and corny. Overall, this movie does not live up to its reputation as a grave mistake. It's one of the few black comedies that I thought was hilarious and doesn't manage to come across as too bizarre for viewing. While the original one satirized women stereotypes in a rather dark way, this one poked fun at it. A thoroughly underrated must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I haven't seen the original version of "The Stepford Wives", i understood the general idea before i watched this years remake. However, this knowledge makes the "surprise" twists during the film easily predictable, although the female-dominated-male-dominated-world one at the was a bit of a surprise.The cast do their job well enough; Kidman does well as the ex-career woman trying to unravel Stepfords secrets, Broderick is fairly effective as the husband who always came in second, Walken is well cast as the calm, authoritative leader, and Close does well as the woman behind-the-scenes. Unfortunately, it takes a little more than good acting to make a good film. Most of the jokes are flat and none of the twists are really shocking; its all a little mechanical."The Stepford Wives" has been described as a "very modern comedy thriller", and maybe this is right. Except without the jokes. Or the thrills.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frank Oz should have stuck with the Muppets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Stepford Wives" is a remake of the 1975 film of the same name, and keeps the same basic premise as the original. A young couple from New York move to Stepford, a quiet, affluent Connecticut suburb, where something very strange seems to be going on. The remake keeps many of the names of the main characters; the main female character, for example, is still called Joanna Eberhart and her husband Walter. It makes, however, many changes to the plot and, more fundamentally, is very different in mood. Bryan Forbes' film was a dark science-fiction thriller with satirical overtones. Frank Oz's version aims to be a camp black comedy, but is never really dark enough for that and ends up more like a camp pale grey comedy.The 1975 film seems an odd choice for a remake, as it was very much a film of its time. Made when feminism was at its height, it can be seen as a satire on contemporary sexist (or "male chauvinist", to use the seventies term) attitudes. Alternatively it can also be seen (and some seventies feminists took exception to it for this reason) as a satire on contemporary feminism, or at least on the anti-male paranoia of the more extremist wing of the movement. Stepford is a sexist dystopia, a place where the crude, boorish men have won the battle of the sexes and, quite literally, reduced their wives to robots. The moral, depending on your point of view, is either "This is how some men see women!" or "This is how some women see men!" In the original film the robotic wives were all attractive, sexually willing and (given that it was made in what has become known as the "decade that taste forgot") surprisingly stylish and elegant in their long, flowing dresses, and it is just about conceivable that their submissive, domesticated attitude represented what some men of that period, at least the older ones, saw as an ideal of femininity. In the remake the wives are still attractive, although their uniform (pastel-coloured floral dresses and big hats) is not as stylish as that of their seventies predecessors. What Oz and the scriptwriter have failed to take into account, however, is the changes in cultural attitudes which have taken place over the last three decades.Today feminism is not the hot topic that it was in the seventies, not because modern women see the feminist cause as irrelevant but because they see most of the battles of that era (over equal pay, for example) as having been fought and won. Women who dress and act like stereotypical bourgeois housewives from the third quarter of the twentieth century cannot be said to represent the modern male's ideal of femininity, especially as the Stepford Wives' sole interests are fashion, cooking, shopping and home decoration, subjects which bore most men to distraction. Twenty-first century man's ideal woman seems to be the ladette, essentially himself incarnated in the body of a beautiful babe, so it might have been funnier to remake the film as "The Stepford Girlfriends", with the brainwashed women looking and dressing like lads'-mag pin-ups whose main interests (apart from sex) are sport, drinking lager, watching action movies and playing violent computer games.For an actress who at her best can be very good (as in the recent "Australia"), Nicole Kidman has a depressingly large number of mediocre or downright bad films on her CV, and this is one of them. One of its weaknesses is that her character, Joanna, is so unsympathetic. In this version, all the wives are high-achieving businesswomen or professionals before their transformation into domestic goddesses, and the funniest scenes in the film are the satirical early ones dealing with Joanna's earlier career as a top television executive. Unfortunately, the main effect of these is to create an indelible impression that Joanna is a prize bitch whose sole achievement is a massive dumbing-down of the nation's culture and for whom transformation into a robotic zombie would be a fitting punishment. Her programme in which happily married couples have their relationship tested by the attentions of professional prostitutes and gigolos might seem tacky to the point of obscenity, but the concept is not too far away from that of an actual reality show, "Temptation Island".Another weakness is that, for a film which is supposedly satirising stereotypical gender roles, this one has a few stereotypes of its own, such as Bette Midler's characterisation of an obviously Jewish character as an insecure, neurotic whiner. The film confirms that Hollywood is tolerant of homosexuals if (and only if) they conform to type as liberal, witty, flamboyant and camp. A gay man who is, for example, politically conservative, sober in dress or quiet in his personality is regarded as an abomination against nature.The film's worst fault, however, is its lack of inner consistency. The original intention was to follow the plot of the 1975 version, in which the wives are murdered by their husbands and replaced with robots, and the earlier scenes were clearly filmed with this idea in mind. This scenario, however, proved unpopular with test audiences, and a new happier ending was shot in which it is made clear that the wives are still alive and have merely been subjected to a reversible brainwashing process. Unfortunately, this ending not only makes little sense in itself but also makes a nonsense of most of what has gone before. There was obviously not enough money in the budget to reshoot the earlier scenes. (Moral; never allow test audiences to influence the creative process). Film lovers should stick with Forbes' much better original. Frank Oz should have stuck with the Muppets. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK i have seen the original when i was a kid and i must admit that film has always been a favourite. Not for the acting and not for the special effects but for the story and concept. (shy to admit never new it was a book until recently) Anyway seeing the new film has provided a good update. The gay insert if not a bit PC was rather funny and worth it.Nicole Kidman has done a good job and well Chris W was as diverse as he will ever be and it is always a pleasure to see him act.The story itself had not changed much until near the end.It was a good film not brilliant but me being a good old fashioned male and liking Scifi and action there was a bit less that i expected.Never the less its a film to sit down with the Missus and watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointing success- if there is such a thing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Stepford Wives did what it set out to do. It took the dark and creepy story of 1975 and turned it into a black comedy- and that was its smartest move. To remake this film into a mysterious thriller like the original, would have been a huge mistake. So it is only fair to recognize that its intention was to make you laugh, and it did just that. Although the film isn't overflowing with comedy, it is filled with its fair share of good humor. The best thing the movie had going for it was the element of surprise. The original 'Stepford' wasn't the most successful film, so it is highly possible that a large amount of today's audience has never seen the original movie. But even if you havn't seen the original, the trailer to this remake gives away almost every surprise in the film. In result, the viewer's enjoyment rests heavily on the last few minutes of the film. This is where the disappointment comes in. I won't give away details, but the ending does have a huge unexpected twist; but it's just not satisfying enough. Even though I completely enjoyed myself while watching the film, and was genuinely shocked at the twist ending, I was still disappointed when the movie ended. But as I look back on seeing the film, I realize that there is no way around this disappointment. The flaws lie in the story, not just the adapted screenplay. See the film, and if it's a let down, ask yourself how it could have actually been better than what it was. The answer is it couldn't be. The story is just a flop in its own way. It leads you on a long and winding road of intrigue, but in the end, you know this can't take you anywhere but to a dead end. And even though there are some loose ends that leave you unsatisfied and partly confused, you have to realize that this film was made all in fun. And with that on your mind, you should enjoy yourself in watching the movie, but don't get your hopes up for too grand of a finale, because most of the film you can see in the preview. Because of Stepford's comedic turn, I grant this film 7 STARS. And I'm sure it would be easier to agree with me if you didn't see the trailer before you saw the film itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The remake is as shocking as the original hoped to be .... but this one is shockingly bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I checked "spoiler" because the revelation that this film fails, top to bottom and front to back, spoils the only secret you have the chance to learn by wasting you time on this one ... how bad it is.Because Roger Ebert gave it "thumbs up", I wasted 90 minutes waiting for the redeeming part, instead of just turning it off after about nine minutes. There IS NO redeeming part. Ebert must have been thinking with his thumb when he saw it.The script sounds like it was intended to be a teen animated feature. That would have been well suited to the director and editor too. What an outlandish waste was the elaborate set decoration!Nicole Kidman's"performance" challenge must have been just continuing on, after seeing what she'd gotten herself into ... especially after seeing that her co-star, Broderick, needed more inspiration to warm his frozen persona. Even I, with that script, could have warmed up playing opposite Kidman, but Mr. Broderick apparently needs more. Good luck with that.I watched the film because of Ebert's "thumb up" on the DVD jacket. Now I know what THAT means, too: he must be sitting on it. Roper needs veto power.Horrible waste of time. On the other hand, if you think you've never seen some "name" stars in a really bad movie, this has possibilities. Naaah! You've seen that before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New adaptation from Ira Levin's best seller with a beauty Nicole Kidman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charming Joanna (Nicole Kidman) is a successful and creative journalist of a TV channel , then she suffers a breakdown for a programme . She along with her hubby (Matthew Broderick) and children are moved from Manhattan towards the quaint little town of Stepford (Conneticut) , a very modern and upper class location . She didn't like the neighborhood with attractive and perfect but unintelligent housewives . She is concerned that many wives spend their lives in domestic slavery . Joanna early befriends a pair good friends (Bette Midler and John Lovitz). Meanwhile , her husband joins the mysterious Stepford Men's club (run by a powerful Christopher Walken and married another too perfect wife , Glenn Close) which takes place in an old Manor house . Joanna soon discovers there lies a dark truth about the strange and servitude behavior in the all female residents and the sinister secrets hidden in the Stepford town . The film is an amiable comedy with sci-fi , thriller elements and a little bit of drama . Heavily re-edited and re-written following test screenings , with new scenes shot and others deleted . The attempts to cater to audience tastes backfired as the new edits and scenes created continuity errors and major story problems . The casting is frankly well . Thus , a beautiful Kidman and good comedian actors : Broderick, Midler , Lovitz . Jolly and lively music by David Arnold . Special mention to colorful and glimmer cinematography by Rob Hahm . This new rendition is preferably a comedy , while the old version by Brian Forbes with Katherine Ross and Paula Prentiss was a chiller and considered to be very superior and being almost a classic film and followed three inferior sequels : ¨Revenge Stepford wives ¨, ¨Stepford children¨, ¨Stepford husbands¨ . The film was regularly directed by Frank Oz . The picture will appeal to the gorgeous Nicole Kidman fans. Rating : Average but amusing .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the worst films of recent years. It is often a mistake to remake an earlier film. It is always a mistake to remake it with no idea why the original was successful, and no understanding of the film itself.A satire needs a degree of subtlety. There was none here. A sci-fi film needs to be presented in a way that allows suspension of belief. This did not. There were plot holes, continuity lapses, and enough loose ends to swallow up the town.For me though the biggest failing was that these women were supposed to be (their men's ideals of) perfect wives. They were not. They were brainless bimbos. That might be some teenage boys ideal woman, but Stepford is supposed to be a town full of scientists and well-educated men - not teenage boys, or boorish men for that matter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Spoilers Herein*** I was against the idea of a remake from the beginning, But I figured not enough people have or are ever going to see the original (although hopefully now, some might),so the idea of a remake sounded pretty fresh to me. Plus, the original worked so well as being scary and not funny, but when I saw that it would be more comedy I thought this could really give them a lot to work with (more plot lines, characters..)They did change it in style and tone, and had an *adequate* movie there...UNTIL THE LAST 20 MINUTES. All I wanna say else about this remake is that it should have ended *with the shopping cart scene*, (implying that YES, Kidman WAS changed into a robot, (or implanted, whatever the film wants to jump to), saying basically that yes, some men still feel threatened by powerful and successful women, but the **difference** or silver lining, is that it was *her choice. I mean, she could have run or resisted, but that scene where she and Matthew are being lowered could've been her realizing that she would rather be a Stepford Wife to her husband than to live without him. Then the shopping cart scene. And then THE END! That would've been SUCH A GREAT FILM!Instead, you get another 20 minutes of pure crapola, that although includes Glenn Close, is not bad because of her. She's by far the best performance here, though Kidman is good. Glenn Close has also never looked betterOverall, I'm gonna have to say WATCH THE ORIGINAL! Especially if you've already sat through THIS one; you'll need the original to redeem your experience. ~peace, estelle</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>loved it-- SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this film unsure of what to expect. The book, which I just read a couple of weekends ago, disturbed me so much that I couldn't stop thinking about it for days afterward. I'd heard that this particular film version was funny; I wasn't sure exactly how they would go about making it funny and I wasn't sure if it would come off well.It came off wonderfully, in my opinion. Though I had heard it was funny, I was unprepared for how often I would laugh out loud. I credit this in large part to the actors-- Bette Midler, Glenn Close, and Christopher Walken all have wonderfully funny moments, and Nicole Kidman and Matthew Broderick are perfectly cast, as well.The ending of the film takes a different turn than the ending of the book, and while the difference in ending means that the meaning of the story is changed, I find the point made at the end of this film version no less meaningful or relevant; rather, I found it far more hopeful and satisfying. Kudos to the marketers of the film for not revealing how it ends in the trailers-- though I also don't think anything in the previews indicates how funny this movie is, and that strikes me as problematic. This movie is pure entertainment from start to end, and I wish I'd gone in prepared to just laugh and have fun.There were a couple of glitches in the plot that I think can be credited to changes that were made to the film after it was shown to test audiences. The explanation, near the end, of what has been done to the Stepford women somewhat contradicts what we see from a few of the women earlier in the film; however, I was willing to overlook it, since the science behind the whole premise is fairly nonsensical.This was a fun movie with a great cast. I look forward to seeing it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I mean, there is a butt-load of much, much worse crap to hate(i.e. Batman and Robin; Manos: Hands of fate; Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone)! The acting is definitely not bad, and the well-known faces do everything they can with an average script and only a few good one-liners.It's an interesting concept for a film, which unfortunately doesn't get used full out. IMO, if this had been made a horror/thriller movie of some sort, making it a wee bit more subtle that the Stepford Wives were cyborgs, it would be much better. As it is now, alas, it is a rather mediocre-funny comedy/drama about a bunch of geeky husbands(Matthew Broderick and Jon Lovits make the best performances) and their far-too-perfect wives(best performances by Nicole Kidman and Glenn Close).Don't let the many fancy names on the DVD box fool you, this is just an average, kind of cozy family film with a really original story and a good director(Frank Oz the Muppet master). It is definitely not a masterpiece, but people should just STOP giving it a lot of sh*t just because it isn't a new Kubrick. Watch it to kill time and see known faces in a strangely surreal comedy. Not a masterpiece, as I mentioned, but it really isn't a bad movie even so.6/10 stars. Watch out for the Robo-Rover 3000! So cute!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ira Levin wrote "The Stepford Wives" in 1972. Like his 1967 novel, "Rosemary's Baby", "Stepford" ably mixed horror, satire and second-wave feminism. It was adapted for the screen in 1975, and again in 2004.Directed by Frank Oz, the 2004 incarnation of Levin's tale spends its first act introducing us to Joanna Eberhart (Nicole Kidman), a high-flying corporate type who spends her days making money, producing television shows and ruining the marriages of men. This act is atrociously written and directed.Things get interesting in "Stepford's" second act, where a better director would have opened the picture. Here Joanna and her husband move to a picturesque town populated by emasculated men. Blaming their grievances on empowered women, these men bemoan both the gradual crumbling of male privilege and the transmogrifying of traditional gender roles. In response, and like every good reactionary, they attempt to "conserve" the past, in this case by turning their wives into obedient robots, each seemingly culled from a 1950s housekeeping magazine."The Stepford Wives" is mostly terrible. Oz replaces the paranoia and horror of Levin with broad humour, and the film's attempts at sophistication, like a last act revelation in which gender expectations are reversed, are mostly trite. Still, Bette Midler and Jon Lovitz are good in minor roles, and Nicole Kidman's various monologues work well in a polemical way. Incidentally, Kidman would star in "Invasion" in 2007, another remake about "mind control" and "robots". Like "Stepford Wives", this film resurrects 1960s/70s politics, removes the urgency and replaces it with assembly-line veneer; cinema for robots, about robots, by robots.6/10 ? Worth one viewing. See "Land of the Dead".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strictly comedy, but doesn't flow very well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been a few years since I saw the original "Stepford Wives", but I recall that it was made as a serious Sci-Fi movie. This one is strictly comedy, from the opening scene where big-shot TV exec Joanna pitches the ultimate reality show, where husbands and wives see if they can "do better" by ditching their spouse. Then getting ditched by the network because of the aftermath of a disgruntled contestant who lost his wife, Joanna (Nicole Kidman) has a complete nervous breakdown. Quitting his job as a network exec too, her husband (Matthew Broderick) moves them and the kids to rural Connecticut, to the sleepy little community of Stepford.MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOW. Joanna finds the women in Stepford strange from the very first meeting. She doesn't know if it is something in the water, or the wives being drugged, but she doesn't want any part of it. She wants out. But she and hubby conspire to trick the other men, she pretends to become a 'stepford wife', but is just playing along to help expose the ruse. Turns out one of the wives (Glenn Close) was behind the whole thing. Her husband (Christopher Walken) was actually a 'stepford husband' and she had designs on converting all the husbands, so that she would be the only "normal" one left. But, of course, she was crazy. The "conversions" were done by placing and programming chips in their brains. They could all be undone via a control center.Bette Midler, Faith Hill, and Jon Lovitz have nice roles. For me, the only real attractions to the movie were Nicole Kidman, who I always enjoy, and Christopher Walken who brightens up any movie he is in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I unfortunately went into this movie with high expectations, given the level of the cast and the potential of the story. While there were a succession of enjoyable scenes, I left horribly disappointed.I haven't seen the original to compare, but the movie felt dated instead of retro. I simply couldn't accept the technical inconsistencies - the wives are at the same time human AND robots, and acted in ways that made the two mutually exclusive. Modern audiences at least need some loosely believable explanation, even if it were to be on the level of a Star Trek episode.The plot was very simply non-existent. I don't have to warn about spoilers, because there really are none to give - nothing happened that wasn't covered in the trailers, and it seemed to be a victim of script-by-committee. Or perhaps script-by-amateur. Nicole Kidman was forgettable, and Matthew Broderick was unconvincing. Even Chris Walken, who ALWAYS excels as a dark, comedic supporting actor seemed to be dialing in his performance. Glenn Close, though not given much of a character to work with, was excellent as usual.The film wasn't completely without merits. While the plot was badly done, much of the script was uproariously funny. As I'm from a wealthy suburb of Connecticut, the audience greatly appreciated many of the stereotypes that were spot on. The writers threw in many wonderful one-liners and sight-gags, which were appreciated. The one thing left to mention is Bette Midler, who single-handedly saves the film. I'm generally not a huge fan, but she played wonderfully, and added much needed life that wasn't found in Nicole, Matthew, or even Jon Lovitz.

		<shortDescription>Dark, disturbing black comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking forward to not enjoying this film given all the rotten feedback I had heard from pretty much everyone. I have never seen the original film and I waited to see this one because critics, friends and family said it was basically crap. So I was pleasantly surprised by this dark, slightly twisted comedy that had a great pace, good characters and just an all around entertaining movie.The Stepford Wives is the story of power woman Joanna Eberhart who runs a Television studio until things take a turn for the worse and the network fires her. Devastated she goes into bouts of depression and has a breakdown. Her husband Walter, hoping to support her, leaves his job and moves his family to the most relaxing place he can find...Stepford. It seems like the perfect town...incredibly perfect, quiet, old fashion, nice people...too nice. In fact all the women in town seem to be always happy, all subservient to their husbands. All the men have a men's club where they secretly meet to have male bonding time. Joanna finds two friends in famous writer Bobbie Markowitz and Roger, the gay man. None of them understand the very weird world the Stepford women seem to have. They even overhear one of these conservative sweet women Sarah Sunderson have incredible sex with her husband in the middle of the afternoon. They all treat their husbands like Gods. Suddenly Joanna's close friends are behaving the same way and she doesn't understand it. Joanna soon discovers that all these women were powerful and rich business women at one time before coming to Stepford and she knows something is up. On top of that her husband Walter is becoming frustrated with her that she doesn't fit in with the rest of Stepford. As she unravels more she will discover that the men in Stepford have created something horrible with these women for their own pleasure. Only the true love for her husband can save her from the same fate.Nicole Kidman in the lead role does a great job. She plays desperation, anxious, and angry woman and the perfect housewife in the flip of a coin. She's a great actress and her versatility does save the movie from boredom. Despite a decent story, there is a borderline feel of slipping into monotony with it but the cast really does a great job. Christopher Walken adds a touch of bad guy to the story and now the women. It might not seem like a tough gig to pretend to be perfect but really their roles hold all the creepy, disturbing and darkly comedic parts. They make the film what it is. Faith Hill does a great job in her acting debut as Sarah Sunderson. She has a very funny and creepy meltdown on the dance floor at one point. Glenn Close also tops off the cast of wives in a very over the top sweet role. Even the usually annoying Jon Lovitz is tolerable and actually quite good as Bette Midler's husband. The problem with this great cast is I think it's almost too good for a movie that isn't supposed to be intense. Because of the lack of intensity you don't get the best from Nicole Kidman, Bette Midler, Walken, Close etc. Still the film is very watchable and very dark and creepy in a light perfect countryside kinda way. There is some messages there about feminism and the age old battle between men and women but I don't think it ever clearly makes a path for one side or the other but rather makes some very bold statements about society and some of the feelings we have towards men and women and their roles. In that way it's probably more intelligent of a film than you'd expect. I definitely want to see the original now and I will see this one again for sure. A very different move for Frank Oz and it's too bad it didn't do better 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake? Not too bad...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original 1975 film was a thriller, high in suspense and dripping with the "new" Women's Liberation Movement. If you go see this "remake", expecting to get the same feeling from it, you will be sorely disappointed. This version of "The Stepford Wives" does follow the book as much as the original movie did, but greatly updated. The references to the original film are cute, tongue-in-cheek, and often unnecessary.The film takes a more humorous approach to the story, and sticks with the jokes throughout the entire course. There are several cheap-shots at sexual humor, so I wouldn't recommend this movie for parents and their kids, unless you want to be answering a LOT of awkward questions afterward. While the humor in the movie does keep it moving along, there are several spots that could've used being cut. They probably would've, if the film wasn't already so short. If you're looking for a politically groundbreaking film (like the first one was), don't bother with this. On the other hand, if you're looking for a sweet story that we were all raised with, put to a different tune, this is perfect. The ending is happier, as Good triumphs over Evil in this newer update. Personally, I prefer this ending to the old one, but I never got into the whole "sad ending" thing of the 70s. If you see this movie, see it for the humour, the light-hearted messages, and the ability to watch Nicole Kidman with a brain (nice change of pace for her roles). Don't see it, expecting a psychological thriller like the original film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: This review may contain spoilers!Lets imagine: where can you find the perfect marriage? Where can you find the perfect lifestyle? Answer: Stepford. Welcome to perfection: the beautiful village of Stepford, where all the drooling nerdish men live perfect lives with their beautiful sex-kitten wives. Wives who listen to their every word, who are obedient, who stay at home cleaning and making cakes everyday. And when their not perfecting their homes and cooking recipes: they are having lessons in doing so. Seem a little suspicious: of course not!Until recently unemployed Joanna Eberhard moves into the village with her husband Walter Kresby and their two children. Fresh from being fired and with a breaking marriage, they hope Stepford can fix things but Joanna is immediately suspicious. Along with Bobbie Markowitz, the two embark on a mission to find out exactly what secret Stepford are holding. But just days after Bobbie's appearance and attitude has been transformed-and she has a mixer coming out of her finger! Joanna, horrified, packs her bags but in a confrontation the truth is revealed with incredible results: the women of stepford are robotic! Will Joanna submit to perfection, after years of an empty marriage, will she finally become the perfect wife Walter desirers? Or will she fight back?The Stepford wives doesn't fail to deliver the right laughs and manages to turn the original horror novel into a light thriller comedy with plenty of laughs but also tension in the right places. Nicole Kidman shines as the career-powered wife Joanna Eberhard and Matthew Boderick puts on a good performance as he desperate husband. However the award for best acting goes to Bette Midler, who plays the equally suspicious Bobbie who was court ordered to Stepford and falls victim to the transformation of a lifetime.This film really doesn't fail to deliver, though there are a few disappointing parts and perhaps the trailer makes it sound better than it turns out-it still pulls of as a original movie that you can't claim has been done before.I give it a good 7 or 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NOTE: I did NOT see the 1975 version, which I've heard is much better.I took three 13 year olds to see this and had no expectations when entering the theatre. In fact, I didn't know what the movie was about except that it had Matt Broderick and Chris Walken and that always equals a good time. I am a huge fan of dark comedies and would label this a soft-dark comedy (a light comedy? ha) that is easy to watch and has an organized feel. There is a creepy and eerie edge throughout the film and I often wondered whether I should be laughing or should if I should be feeling sorry for the characters. (I love that feeling, I always feel like the jerk in the theatre)(And yes, I usually laugh instead) Overall, I kinda liked it and I thought there was something to it..I just don't know what. I will say it could have been a lot darker and I plan on checking out the other version.SNACK ATTACK FOR THIS FILM: freshly baked cupcakes and an apple. At least that's what I felt like eating during this one. (check out my other reviews for snack attack suggestions)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A suspenseful remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read the Ira Levin book and seen the 1975 film, I was pleasantly surprised by the modern twist - emphasis on TWIST - of this "Stepford Wives" versus the original version. It kept the principal message of the story while almost spoofing it at the same time. As usual, Nicole Kidman was brilliant, and the already Stepford-ized actresses were eerily convincing enough to maintain the suspense. I hadn't expected to be kept guessing - or to be so entertained! Though I'm not sure it could be appreciated as a standalone film - as is evidenced by the many negative reviews it received - it definitely gave me the feeling of a tribute, almost as "High Society" was to "The Philadelphia Story." The comic timing of the ensemble even managed to make some clichés funny all over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget this mess and rent the original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original STEPFORD WIVES was a creepy movie with subtle touches of humor. That subtlety allowed the suspense and the sense of danger to build slowly, leading up to a rather disturbing finale. In this version, there is no subtlety or building up. Rather, the tone shifts are as jarring as jump cuts. It's a satire! It's a "campy" comedy! It's a suspense thriller! Look out! Here comes a happy ending! Not to mention the inconsistencies regarding the "Stepfordization" of the wives (discussed in other user comments). It's as if Frank Oz and company threw a bunch of unrelated scenes together and hoped no one would notice.As for the cast, it's a disappointment to see such interesting actors and actresses assembled in such a weak film. Blame Paul Rudnick, whose campy-queeny- faggy humor is really wearing thin. (And I can write that because I'm gay!)Didn't Bette Midler learn her lesson after ISN'T SHE GREAT????I encourage everyone out there to run to the video store and rent the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you spent $10 for this movie, you would undoubtedly want 8.50 of it back. As it is, I spent $3.95 on movies on demand and felt cheated.This is an extremely flimsy movie drenched in color with a fantastic cast that falls short of being either scary or funny. One certainly expects more - a lot more - from Paul Rudnick. There were a lot of missed opportunities here, due to the fact that the film couldn't figure out what it wanted to be.Glenn Close is positively hilarious as the head matron, but most of the rest of this marvelous cast, including Nicole Kidman, Bette Midler, Christopher Walken, and Matthew Broderick are wasted. There are some very good moments, and the opening credits are brilliant. But ultimately it falls short.And I mean short. As a screenwriter myself, I know that a script must be at least 90 pages. If this movie was 75 pages, I'll eat one of Glenn Close's gorgeous hats. Folks, don't rip off your audience like that. It's not good business.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>laughed hard, as did a very full theater!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite "iffy" reviews, a friend and I could not wait to see this remake. We went Friday afternoon and the theater was full. During the movie, there was lots of loud laughter throughout the theater. The audience clearly enjoyed this movie, as did we. In fact, this movie is a hoot. From start to finish it is a side-splitting, over the top, tongue-in-cheek revision of the original film. Although (as has been noted in other comments) the ending is a "little" disconnected from the earlier explanations of the Stepfordization process, it was not until I had gotten home that I even realized this.It is precisely because the remake is so over done, the circumstances so outrageous, that the present-day setting provides such a perfect comedic set-up for this introduction to the town of Stepford. In the beginning, Kidman's T.V. executive persona is seen presenting a Fall line-up of reality T.V. shows that mimics Survivor and its progeny, but also introduces the battle of the sexes that is taken to the extreme in the town of Stepford. By the time of her sudden departure from the network and her family's move to the suburbs, I was already in fits of laughter (as were those around me) and looking forward to the introduction of Bette Midler and Glenn Close's characters. I was not disappointed.Bette Midler's droll commentary on her too-perfect neighbors, and the friendship between Bette Midler's Bobbi, Nicole Kidman's Joanna, and their Gay neighbor, provides the context for some of the absolutely funniest movie moments I have seen this year. As with many absolutely hysterical movies, if one examines the plot too closely deep holes can be discovered. The beauty of this film is that while in the theatre, you are kept laughing too hard to give much thought to anything other than catching your breath before the next joke is upon you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great credit sequence, downhill from there!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting too much from this movie, given the reviews it got. But how bad could a movie be with this cast? As it turns out, VERY bad. But I have to think that some plot and character development was lost on the cutting room floor.The opening credit sequence is absolutely brilliant, with witty use of vintage '50s clips of housewives in their "miracle kitchens of the future" and that sort of thing. Deliberately choppy editing and occasionally speeded up action lend the sequence a mechanical feel on top of its satirical air. Too bad nothing else in the movie measures up to it.I did think there were a couple of decent laughs, mainly when Glenn Close was on screen. Roger Bart, playing a gay stereotype we've seen too many times in recent movies, milks it for all its worth and earns some chuckles, too. But Nicole Kidman and Matthew Broderick often seem lost. Christopher Walken, Bette Midler and Jon Lovitz are all mostly boring here, hard as it is to believe.I haven't seen the '70s version in ages, but I remember thinking it was OK but campier than it was meant to be. Upping the camp level was not a bad idea for the remake, but I don't know what happened with the screenplay. Paul Rudnick is no genius, but he's done far better. I get the feeling that major scenes must have been cut out for some reason, as the plot development felt awkward especially in the early scenes. It might be worth renting the DVD for the deleted scenes.Also, as others have stated, the movie is totally inconsistent on the point of whether the women are robots or have simply had their brains altered. It's as if they figured we wouldn't really be playing close attention, so what difference did it make?My bottom line advice -- if you get a chance to see it without paying, watch the opening credits and then change the channel.</fullReview>

The script is of the cheapest kind. Little TV jokes and no characters. Nicole Kidman, a superb actress, throws herself into the part but there is no part. Bette Midler, always a welcome relief, goes through her changes withous allowing us to understand or care how, when or why. Glenn Close, one of my favorites, does an embarrassing impersonation of a someone impersonating a Stepford wife. Who's idea was the gay couple? Please! It is, without question, one of the most ill conceived ideas ever put on film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Forget to Add Value to Your Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to review films which are re-makes or re-hashes of an original. But lets try! We all know the basic conceit of the film in that husbands can replace their over-achieving wives with eponymous housewives - who are for decorative value with their 'drive' in business/science/political life etc removed and replaced with a subservient decorative 'housewife' aspect.I find 'successful America' a shallow backdrop, but this is necessary here as the plot involves the well to do in their gated estate. The general situation emerges in an unsubtle way. Wives are shallow and ornamental, and time is spent allowing the husbands to confirm that is how they want their wives to be. We know there is something peculiar going on when one of the wives has a malfunction during a civic dance. This pretty much confirms Kidmans sense that something is amiss. Walken makes an an appearance as the brains behind the situation, but without any suspense or intrigue about his character or what that character does. There is a housewife who doesn't appear to fulfil the ideal presented played by Midler. But the role played is simply to provide the contrast between actual wives and the 'ideal' wives. She ends up being converted, but to be honest, I was wondering why she had not been up to that point. There is a decision to be taken by Broderick in respect of his wife, but watch the film to see what this is. The final part of the film comes at a ballroom event, and we are then told what we need to know about the wives, who is responsible and the status of the relationship between Kidman/Broderick.There is a pretty poor twist to the film's ending, but it adds little. A film which seemed more about the American high-life than the basic scenario about re-manufacturing individuals as life-style accessories and dealing with issues that might be expected to arise.The film was visually attractive, but lacking in any real plot development and ultimately for the characters, a lack of empathy or understanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Remake Without the Punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What does it take to become a Stepford wife, a woman perfect beyond belief? Ask the Stepford husbands, who've created this high-tech terrifying little town, in a very modern comedy-thriller.This film is notorious for the numerous production problems that occurred throughout its shooting schedule. The tension started when both John and Joan Cusack, originally slated to star in supporting roles, pulled out of the project and were replaced by Matthew Broderick and Bette Midler, respectively. After filming was initially completed, several changes were made to the new script, which created a number of plot holes, and the cast was called back for reshoots. Nicole Kidman was reportedly so dissatisfied with the new screenplay that she considered pulling out of the project.And, indeed, it just has no punch. The original film, like it or not, is a cultural touchstone and really served a purpose. The remake seems to have no purpose, and although it has a few good qualities -- the attempt to make it a comedy rather than a social horror tale -- it just seems flat. Amazingly, despite overwhelmingly bad reviews, it was praised by Roger Ebert. Maybe he saw a different film.The potential was there, but something went horribly wrong. This is a film that could possibly be considered "so bad it's good", but even that might be giving it too much credit because it is not nearly that much fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my old review: The Stepford Wives (2004) was a surprise to me, the trailer really did intrigue me, but the actual movie was laughable. I was a big fan of almost every cast member, including Glenn Close, Nicole Kidman, Matthew Broderick, and of course Bette Midler. The cast member's performances were pretty good, not Oscar worthy by any means, but still pretty good fit the kind of movie it was. Some scenes were funny, including the scene with the wive's book club. Let me just say that for me personally, Bette Midler was the best part of this entire movie, by far. The script was kinda lackluster and poor, and some of the jokes were just bad, and didn't work. I would've liked a little less comedy and a little more seriousness. The look of the film was good, the shots and costume design and sets all looked very good. Overall, the movie was just a little too silly for my personal taste. So would I recommend The Stepford Wives (2004)? No. It's not worth your time, there are much better movies out there to enjoy. After re watching it: I liked a lot of the jokes better, the comedy works, I found myself laughing so much the 2nd time I watched it. It was a lot more entertaining this time, and I had fun watching it, it's a comedic, cute, interesting film. My NEW rating: 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is just an excuse for a bunch of jokes about sexism, which is exactly what we wanted. The jokes are good and the humor is never scatological. The characters are fairly well drawn though hardly complex. On the whole it is above average for a genre, the cutesy remake, which tends to be horrible. If you have any ideas about how you would do a new Stepford Wives you will probably be disappointed and annoyed. There is relatively little social commentary or suspense, in fact the only suspenseful scene is just funny. The hows and whats of what the ladies are isn't really addressed much, in part because it would be more disturbing than this movie wants to be. On the other hand, it never breaks character, so you can just cruise comfortably to the end, laughing every minute or so.As a professional horticulturist, I must mention the plantings and flower arrangements. The orchids were just becoming available at grocery stores and the gladiolus in the "plantings" must have been hand placed in some cases, cause they don't grow in graceful sprays.

		<fullReview>Thirty years after the release of the critically acclaimed original here is the critically slammed remake.Nicole Kidman is a hard as nails television executive who makes feminist television reality shows. She gets fired when a male victim of one of her shows goes postal.Matthew Broderick plays her husband and is also a media executive. He has noticed the despite being a successful couple their marriage has suffered because of the work/life balance.After her dismissal the couple move to the town of Stepford which seems like an idyllic retreat from the stresses and strains of the rat race in the city. The wives are the stay at home types and the husbands seems to be all rest and play. Not sure who does any work!Broderick recognizes that Stepford is a happy community. Kidman along with frumpy author Bette Midler and a renowned gay designer finds there is something wrong with this white picket fenced Republican wet dream.This version is a satire mixed with black humour and a surprisingly amiable film as long as you park your brain elsewhere. The film went through re-shoots with an ending that does not work. Then again a lot of the film does not work if you spend too long thinking about it. Its as a half good idea and an unfinished script which got the green light to go into production.Are these women robots or was there some sort of brain re- programming? If they are robots the original women must be dead? We have a scene where one of the women dispenses bank notes for some reason. If its some sort of brain re-programming then the women could become normal at the end of the film. However the film wants it both ways which means the script was not ready, unsure or had to be re-shot later on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An empty candy wrapper of a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Oz's remake of The Stepford Wives is a convoluted, misguided film, one that has a great idea but can't separate itself from it even at arm's length to show the audience why the idea is so great. It's a film that was ostensibly built off of the love for a premise but burdened by an inability to communicate that premise's ideas and thematic relevance to the audience. As a result, we get a ninety-three minute affair with unlikable characters, lackluster jokes, and a film that seems to be completely robbed of its social commentary.We focus on Joanna Eberhart (Nicole Kidman), a lanky, corporate woman who runs a successful Television network; we open on her pitching a series of shameful, dehumanizing reality TV shows that involve married couples making the decision to either stay with their husband or leave them for the hunks or goddesses they've acquainted themselves with over a lavish retreat. When one of the cuckolded husbands takes a gun to Joanna in the middle of her pitch, she carelessly moves on to trying to pitch a show to her boss about forgiving the shooter and helping the newly destroyed couple's marriage situation. This opening scene is about as pointless as they come, telling us very little about Joanna other than there's no real reason to care about her or sympathize with her.When Joanna's controversial pitches result in her getting fired, Joanna's husband Walter (Matthew Broderick) suggests they move to the quiet haven of Stepford, Connecticut. Stepford is a plastic village, filled with mansions, perfectly trimmed shrubbery, and the appearance of perfection so pristine that any gated community would be jealous. Upon moving there, Joanna spots a cloying and disturbing "perfectness" to the females of Stepford, who operate with a coldness but immaculate precision (one of these females is Faith Hill, who, sadly, has no character and no real significance here). She quickly befriends the sassy Bobbie (Bette Midler) and the effeminate Roger (Roger Bart) in efforts to see through the women of Stepford, especially the maniacal Claire (Glenn Close), who runs the community and maintains its level of obsessive perfectness.The Stepford Wives' immediately problem is it simply doesn't know what the hell it wants to say about men and women in society, gender roles, the male perception of females, vice-versa, or really anything. It simply exists to show a gaggle of unlikable, affluent characters complain at one another (the repetitive arguments between Joanna and Walter wore me down almost as quickly as the entire film itself), and without the presence or significance of social commentary, this film quickly becomes little else than an empty candy wrapper.The original Stepford Wives novel, written by Ira Levin, concerned the impact submissive, obeying housewives had on a community and really peeled back layers of gender relations to show how men really like their women in society with science-fiction twists. The film adaptation, directed by Levin as well, drifted from the science-fiction genre into the horror genre, another passable approach to the story, which led to its cult status amongst horror fans. Oz and screenwriter Paul Rudnick's attempt to bring comedy into the mix, however, feels like a cheap ploy being that the film doesn't have any of its satirical elements in place nor anything meaningful to say about the relationship between men and women in society.The cast here is also wasted, as Kidman's incredibly serious demeanor - which throws off any kind of likability for her character - becomes grating when you realize it's as if she was put in this film only to argue with everyone around her. Broderick is given a thoroughly lame character, as are most of the male actors here because they're not only robbed of personality but they're given the depressingly shallow male roles which perceive women as nothing more than nagging shrews. Finally, as stated, Faith Hill is criminally shortchanged here, as so much time is given to Glenn Close and Kidman it's a wonder why the casting department went through the trouble and the added expense to get a talented personality they weren't going to utilize.Frank Oz's The Stepford Wives is a curious comedic failure, robbed of almost any and all wit with its commendable, picture-perfect set design being its only commendable asset. The supermarket settings are meticulously rendered to give the impression that not a carton of eggs is uneven or a gallon of milk is crooked. If only the film's screen writing had the same kind of explicit order and gave the appearance of something that was checked multiple times before it was allowed to pass.Starring: Nicole Kidman, Matthew Broderick, Bette Midler, Roger Bart, Glenn Close, Christopher Walkin, and Faith Hill. Directed by: Frank Oz.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Stepford Wives (2004): Dir: Frank Oz / Cast: Nicole Kidman, Matthew Broderick, Bette Midler, Christopher Walken, Glenn Close: Remake of the 1975 thriller only this time director Frank Oz chose to play this as a dark comedy. It is a film about image and the idea that these wives are so radiant. Nicole Kidman stars as a successful T.V. producer who is fired when one of her participants goes on a killing rampage. Her husband decides to move them to Stepford where "there is no crime, poverty or pushing." It is a place lined with beautiful mansions and women who are just too artificial. Another achievement by Oz who also made Bowfinger and What About Bob? Kidman is superb as a woman surviving a nervous breakdown and learning that true love is never artificial. Matthew Broderick is well cast as her husband who is adopted into the Stepford Men's Club. Bette Midler steals scenes as a cynical novelist. Christopher Walken plays the head citizen who shelters a secret that won't be revealed here. Glenn Close plays the female who seems to second the Walken character and does so with a lot of spirit. Beautiful sets and art direction highlight despite a plot concept that isn't probable due to operation and effect. The film exposes consumerism and the reality that everybody has flaws and defects. It also exposes bad traditions and the reality that no place on earth is this pleasant. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stepford has been Stepfordized. Pretty much all of the original satire, bite, and menace has been drained from the original source material, leaving behind a defanged, lame, near romantic comedy. This pale imitation might pass with people completely unfamiliar with the book or the first movie, but the rest of us can sense a living, breathing production that has been replaced by a soulless robot. I guess that is what they call meta nowadays. Nicole Kidman plays a cold fish (not too difficult), and Matthew Broderick plays a sad sack (not too difficult either). Hold on, on second thought, maybe they're both robots too. I mean in real life. Uh oh, maybe everyone around me are robots too. Now I'm starting to get worried. Wow, the philosophical zombie problem. And I didn't think that this movie was deep. What do I do? How can I tell? I've got to start thinking. In the meantime, I hope this below average time-waster keeps the robots distracted, while I work out what to do before they realize I'm on to them. Maybe I'd better rate this a 5? But that might be too obvious. Maybe a 4? Now, I'm really confused.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Remake EVER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT***SPOILER ALERT*** I was so looking forward to the new version of "Stepford Wives". Since the original was made in 1975, I was looking forward to not only today's special effects, but how much scarier it would be. Sadly, the filmmakers decided to turn it into a comedy. HUGE mistake with many repercussions.EXAMPLE: 1975 Version: The scene ends with Joanna confronting the men's club and learning the truth: that all wives have been killed and replaced with clone robots. The next and final scene shows Joanna, as a robot, pushing a cart in the local grocery, greeting the other wives, also pushing carts.2004 Version. The scene ends with Joanna (donning short, dark hair) confronting the men's club and the viewer thinks she is learning the truth. Instead of cutting to the original final scene, the filmmakers added a scene. Glenn Close's character, Claire, is throwing a ball. Everyone is decked out in gowns and tuxedos. Joanna (Nicole Kidman) now has very long, strawberry blonde hair and is talking and acting like a robot.This is one of many examples where the film becomes unhinged. Joanna sneaks into the computer room and corrupts the entire computer system (how? she is not a computer programmer?). We then see all the wives suddenly grasp their foreheads, to demonstrate awful headaches and returning to their normal selves! Since one wife was able to accept a debit card and dispense money with her mouth, how is it possible that she is not totally a robot? The filmmakers think we are stupid.In addition, if they wanted us to believe Joanna was faking being a robot, why didn't they leave her short, dark hairdo alone? Instead of having Nicole Kidman wear a long wig, she has her own natural hairdo. This would've been okay, if they had styled it like a wig. I do not know of any wig company that offers a combed-back hairline style, do you?When we return to the ballroom, the scene ends with Mike (Christopher Walken) having his head knocked off, revealing a computerized interior. So Mike is a robot. Claire (Glenn Close) reveals to all present that she killed Mike after finding him in bed with his new, much younger work assistant. If this is true, then why weren't the wives, in the new Stepford community which she founded, killed off as well?Many great actors thrusts into a lackluster film. Just plain sad.</fullReview>

The face of master actress Glenn Close and that of average actress Nicole Kidman, would both look better than 10 years ago if only plastic were better than skin, while they sadly are rendered incapable of expression by cosmetic surgery, to a degree making us feel thankful for surgery on eyes being impossible ? or else Kidman would likely have already wasted her astounding ones as she did with her face.This version is however inferior to the original, dating 3 decades back in time, and while the representation of mass media and doll-women are well achieved, the film is quite barren of either any distinctive concept or seriously amusing joke. It can still be enjoyable if regarded as shallow entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening at a lavish shareholders meeting presenting a bunch of reality TV shows feels about as long as a reality show and half as funny. Things move into cartoony camp when we reach Stepford and while the occasional one liner hits, most of the movie feels patched together and episodic. Nicole Kidman hams it up with an over the top performance, Matthew Broderick seems bored, Glenn Close chews the scenery and the props and the rest of the large cast does a decent job. The whole last act feels tinkered with from being test screened to death, including a tacked on final scene meant to explain everything with Larry King. While not a disaster, this Stepford Wives remake is a mess of uneven tone and feels oddly sanitized considering the subversive material, which was gutted during the testing process. All of the plot points have a connect the dots feel since everything was reworked after production ended and added scenes are usually expository instead of letting the action dictate the plot. The end result is a great cast stuck inside a film where egos and production nightmares prevented everyone's best work and a behind the scenes documentary on this troubled production would be a hell of a lot more entertaining than the film.</fullReview>

The reality show parodies at the beginning fell flat, Bette Midler had no particularly funny lines, and the only laughs came from the tired queen stereotype gay men and some comically demented moments from Glenn Close. The 1975 film with Katharine Ross is no classic. Ross was such a passive movie presence in general that there was nothing at stake in the threat of her being transformed by the nefarious doings of the Stepford Men's Club. So the idea of a remake is a good one, especially since the backlash against feminism is still going strong even with the advances women have obtained in the last few decades - conservatives (male and female) are still criticizing working moms and some religious groups are more proactive in proselytizing about women subjecting their wills to their husbands. To give "Stepford Wives" the treatment it needs would require a dark satire, not the over-the-top dumb farce we get here. The performers do their best with the lousy material, though the idea that someone as young as Kidman would run a network struck me as implausible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For the most part not as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will need to re-watch the original when I get a chance, because I like things that analyze relationships between men and women. The only improvements on this over (what I remember of) the original were the implication of "programmable kitchens" and the ending - showing that the originator of Stepford was a woman who replaced her husband with a robot. The implication of both Stepford movies is that robots would be more pleasing because all conflict would be removed. My own opinion is that (except for raising children) the traditional family is the wrong concept. Two people can live together perfectly happy if they do activities together but with their own means and only spend as much time together as they both wish. That way, the only possible conflicts are in how much time they choose to be together. I tried it once before (with some success, and I still wish him well) but he originally found me too aggressive, and he needs to remain geographically bound, so I am now 3 months into another (even better) relationship with a man who has all the best features of the other, with definite improvements. My only programming of a man is stating exactly what I was looking for online -and I found him. Robots would be totally wrong for any thinking person, because giving pleasure is part of experiencing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfunny and too broad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joanna Eberhart (Nicole Kidman) is an aggressive TV executive whose programming cause a contestant to snap and try to kill her. She's fired and her family moves to Stepford, Connecticut to escape from it all. Once there, she finds there is something wrong with all the women.This starts with a horribly ugly introduction to Joanna. Then her husband played by Matthew Broderick look like a clueless idiot. Then he turns evil. All the guys are weaklings. All the women look like they're plastic. I guess it's a satire. But I don't think any of it is funny. These characters are as fake as they come.Every character is just so broad. Every character is just so annoying. And then, there are the problems with the ending. Without spoilers, the ending is a mess that leaves a big question up in the air.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, many moons have passed since the release of this film, but it still stands as a depressing indictment of how Hollywood creatively operates. In terms of content, the first half of The Stepford Wives is not too bad, certainly lighter than the original, but it still keeps to the spirit of the piece and Nicole Kidman is always a class act. And then there comes the extraordinary reboot: an irrational plot turn that happens before your very eyes. Indeed, it is as if it had featured a producer actually walking into frame and crying out: "Whoa, back it up, Mr Oz! I've just finally finished watching the original and it's really, really bleak! Quite horrible, in fact, and a total downer. Who knew? At this budget we want light and frothy! We want Matthew Broderick's amusing hangdog face, a delightful battle-of-the-sexes farce, and Jon Lovitz/Bette Midler screwball antics. We most assuredly don't want MURDER. So, audience, please forget the robots (what robots?), forget everything you saw until now (except the laughs!) - the ATM machine wife, the burning hand but no pain or ill-effects, the malfunctioning Country-lite singer - just go with the new 'hypnosis chip' angle from now on. Yes, I know that makes absolutely no sense at all, and I know that you have seen robots, but just imagine that that was a funny Nicole Kidman dream. So, enjoy the rest of what is now a very different film, and good evening". And thus the producer exits stage left and we indeed are expected to expunge whole scenes and accept the happy ending. Hollywood can be a most peculiar place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The acting in this movie is great but the plot is full of holes and feels hurried. The viewer is introduced to the Stepford community with such a speed that scenes are gone before the viewer has enough time to get accustomed to the mood and the current environment. I can't really pinpoint what made feel like that while watching the movie so perhaps the director wasn't up for the task.I also felt that the characters were left quite shallow. That didn't work too well for this movie as the viewer has to follow the characters waltzing around. After the initial introduction of the characters they didn't really grow or change at all.The movie could have been way better if the plot (the script) had been better but it was way too predictable and full of un-logical behavior or happenings. The movie is tagged as comedy/scifi/thriller but I didn't find anything to laugh at nor was the scifi part believable. Actually, some of the CGI had been left so rudimentary (on purpose I believe) that it was just sad. The thriller part failed to deliver too with the predictable plot. The characters were too sweet to make the viewer expect anything else than a "happy end".</fullReview>

The concept was horrific.. Everyone in this version of the movie is so unbelievably obnoxious, both male and female, that you would gladly nuke the town! Even the tacked on ending, no reveal here, doesn't make up for the scripts failings. This 'post modern' version is not funny, not horrific and unaffecting - aside perhaps from the desire to wonder where the last couple of hours of your life went and why...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What was Frank Oz thinking? He knows how to make good films. Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, anyone? So how did he misfire so horribly with this thing? Actually, I'm sure it wasn't all his fault for the outcome of this totally and utterly pointless remake of a decent film from yep, you guessed it, the 70's. Is it just me or is Hollywood having a midlife crisis? What's with all the needless remakes of already well-done flicks? What gives? Why can't they remake a crappy film and turn it into a true success story? Oh, because that would actually mean it has to be good...sorry, I forgot. With an excellent cast of tried and true actors you would naturally think they'd be able to bring the quality up past the mediocre script that was summoned for this ridiculous excuse of a film. Nicole Kidman, Matthew Broderick, Christopher Walken and Bette Midler would usually make for a pretty powerful cast. Here, however, they're all just flopping around in a nice-looking but astonishingly empty rehash of stuff we've already visited. Where's the novelty in that? It would be one thing if the creators attempted to take it into a different direction, thus giving validity to this remake. Alas, no such luck here. They just go through the motions and expect everyone to "ooh" and "aah" at a plot they think no one's ever heard of before at all. Who are they kidding? This is probably the most unfunny "black comedy" I've ever seen...And I use that term loosely, since there's really nothing "black" or "dark" about it at all; even though it wants you to believe that it indeed is...Don't fall for it. Do yourself a favor and just go watch the original 70's version which is much better than this thing could ever hope to be...It's lifeless, toothless and completely worthless...Don't waste your time...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Stepford Wives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From former Muppets' Fozzie Bear and Miss Piggy actor now director Frank Oz (Little Shop of Horrors, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, In &amp; Out, Bowfinger), I had seen the original version and found it quite creepy, I knew this remake couldn't match it, I just wanted to see how much so. Basically hugely successful television network president Joanna Eberhart (Nicole Kidman) has suffered a nervous breakdown after some shocking events, and her husband Walter (Matthew Broderick) thinks she will find herself again when they move from Manhattan to the upper-class, modern and seemingly peaceful community of Stepford, Connecticut. She soon makes good friends with Jewish writer and recovering alcoholic Bobbie Markowitz (Bette Midler), and they both notice something strange going on with the other female residents of the town, they all seem to happy and too perfect. After suffering for too long seeing everything overly nice with no arguments, no trauma and ultimately no sadness or despair Joanna wants to leave the town, but before she can she finds out that Bobbie has succumbed to whatever this horror is too. Eventually it is revealed that she, Claire Wellington (Glenn Close) and of all the other women in the town have been turned into robotic counterparts, made with the technological advances by Mike Wellington (Christopher Walken). He has created a chip for the female brain that will eliminate all annoying and bad habits of a woman, such as nagging, anger and ultimately true humanity to make them robotic beings that only think and act positive, and somehow Walter is part of the clan of men who wants part of it. So soon enough after finding out this big conspiracy Joanna herself becomes a more beautiful robotic version of herself, but don't worry, Walter sees the error of his ways and that this big thing is wrong, and in the end all the women go back to normal, and the men do shopping as punishment. Also starring Jon Lovitz as Dave Markowitz, "There You'll Be" singer Faith Hill as Sarah Sunderson, Roger Bart as Roger Bannister, David Marshall Grant as Jerry Harmon, Dylan Hartigan as Pete Kresby, Fallon Brooking as Kimberly Kresby and Matt Malloy as Herb Sunderson. Kidman is ironically just as robotic as what she becomes later, as is Broderick as her husband, and the talents of Midler, Close and Walken are wasted, it was nice to see the moments reflecting the original, such as the final scene in the supermarket, but the ridiculous addition of a happier ending, and the overall feel of the film is more funny than freaky like the much more interesting original and not funny thriller, this is also not a funny and ultimately stupid science-fiction comedy thriller. Adequate!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can imagine how "The Stepford Wives" could anger people, after seeing the original which I can only imagine to be the complete opposite of this (I haven't seen it) in the sense that it would be scary not funny. But if you just sit down and enjoy the film for what it is, it's actually a very watchable and amusing experience.The person who makes the film is Bette Midler as the eccentric hippie writer. Once again she steals every scene with her funny lines and hilarious comedy timing. All fans of Bette Midler should definitely seek this out just for her alone! The film on the whole is actually quite witty and enjoyable it's just a shame the screenplay wasn't stronger on the story side! "The Stepford Wives" could also be quite offensive to any gender or gay people. It's sexist in the way it portrays men as slobs sitting around in a circle playing robot wars and just treating women as objects, wanting nothing from them but sex and cash. Now I'm sure some men do (I hope the don't!) but for the majority of men I don't think that's what they want! It's also sexist in the way it portrays women as being good housewives, sitting around cleaning all day and making thousands of cupcakes. It's homophobic in the way it thrusts gay stereotypes onto us. Bear in mind that all of this is done through humour and shouldn't be taken seriously, but still some people could find this offensive! Basically this is your standard chick-flick but with an added fizz, it's completely daft but fun. You can tell that everyone involved was having fun playing there part, Glenn Close was particularly enjoyable as the crazy owner of "Stepford". I quite enjoyed it, it certainly wasn't dull but is nothing out of the ordinary!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawed, but fun and funny update of the classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some stories are really difficult to update and make relevant in a different time. People have tried, for example with remakes of classic films, sometimes successfully and others it just didn't translate well. The original 'The Stepford Wives' and the novel by Ira Levin both came out around the time of second phase feminism. The film was followed by three made for TV sequels, none of which have the same power. With all the remakes lately it was no surprise that it was announced that the 1975 classic would be getting this treatment. However, this posed the question of would the creators find a way to make the concept work for the new millennium? The answer is that, for the most part, yes.Pros: Amazing cast, great performances. Great opening title sequence, and should I say ominous. Beautiful score, at times sounding like one you'd find in films from the Golden Age of Hollywood. Fun and witty script. Production design that's over-the-top in it's exquisiteness. Quick pacing. Plenty funny lines and situations. Though not really a Horror film like the original, there are still some moments that could give one the chills.Cons: Some plot holes, likely due to post-production tinkering. Not all the humor hits the mark. Though this does bring the concept up to date, the film misses the opportunity to make a great statement about current gender relations. The finale is a bit of a mess.Final thoughts: The trailer for this film really made it look like we were in for a great dark Comedy. The original is more of a Horror/Thriller and it looked as if the makers of this film were taking a new approach, and they were. The result isn't as good as it could have been, but it's not as bad as you may have heard. The cast, production, and humor all make this worthwhile viewing.My rating: 3.5/5</fullReview>

It wasn't heavy duty, sure, but many movies are not.The script isn't brilliant, but Frank Oz shines as director as do the star studded cast- Nicole Kidman, Bette Midler, Christopher Walken and especially Glen Close... I won't spoil the ending for you but she is simply fantastic in her role. The cast make the not-so-brilliant script really, really good.Matthew Broderick stumbles through this film, as he does in any movie he's in. I never expect much from him and was not surprised by his performance in this movie. Faith Hill doesn't have more then 4 lines in this movie, but she is pretty believable in her role.In short, good movie... don't go looking for some great masterpiece, some great thinker that leaves you shaken and stirred and you will be entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Step Lightly in Stepford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleazy TV executive Nicole Kidman (as Joanna Eberhart) survives after a disgruntled reality show star tries to assassinate her - but, Ms. Kidman suffers a nervous breakdown, after being fired by shareholders. Sensitive husband Matthew Broderick (as Walter Kresby) decides to quit his lesser-paying job, and use the couple's obviously substantial savings to buy an early retirement home in the "perfect" town of Stepford, Connecticut. Ladylike realtor Glenn Close (as Claire Wellington) explains, "It has no crime, no poverty, and no pushing." Strangest of all, most of "The Stepford Wives" obey their husbands with robotic subservience. They are ultra-perfect housewives - cleaning, cooking, and always ready for sex.Quickly, Kidman comes back to her senses, and becomes friendly with singularly untidy resident Bette Midler (as Bobbie Markowitz) and girlishly gay Roger Bart (as Roger Bannister). Meanwhile, Mr. Broderick joins the men's club fronted by Ms. Close's husband, the well-coiffed Christopher Walken (as Mike Wellington). When her imperfect pals begin to change, Kidman thinks something's rotten in Stepford. And, she's right. Watching it unfold is moderately enjoyable, but there are missteps and missed opportunities. Kidman, to her credit, tries to turns it around; but, the opening makes you dislike the lead character. Also, however it was in the original book or earlier film - here, the last act badly needs revision.**** The Stepford Wives (6/6/04) Frank Oz ~ Nicole Kidman, Matthew Broderick, Glenn Close, Bette Midler</fullReview>

The suspense element of the first one is virtually ignored in this remake. I am an optimist on many levels in life and I wish that this movie had succeeded but the reasons are clear why it did not succeed within the first few minutes.

		<fullReview>This comedic adaptation of Ira Levin's novel could potentially have worked very well but it suffers from a painfully unfunny script and the re-shoots are evident throughout.It's a horribly confused mess, but it's unclear whether all its problems are a result of reaction to poor test screenings or whether it was a lame duck to begin with. There certainly aren't many successful gags in the film, (just many poor ones), the performances are all pitched too high and the music is silly and intrusive. On the other hand it's hard to see how any half-decent writer could allow the issue of whether the women are in fact robots or just brainwashed to become so foggy. Issues like that and the often uneven tone suggest it was a mixture of both.At least it's brief, and it's watchable - just about - in a car crash kind of way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Subtlety at all....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's the bottom line of this movie. The Motto of Hollywood remakes- let's take an interesting concept from a past movie and totally bastardize it, lowering it to the lowest common denominator! This film was directed by Frank Oz, famous as someone who manipulated puppets, from Sesame Street's Grover to Star War's Yoda. Sadly, his puppets had more life to them than his live action characters."If stupid your film is, suck it always will!" The film's opening credits opens with vintage film of 1950's housewives with 1950's appliances, the MESSAGE- that men see women as being interchangeable with appliances.The rest of the film begins with the character of Joanna, who is a TV president in charge of a network whose reality-TV shows demean and emasculate men. Her career crashes when a victim of one of her shows goes on a shooting spree.Her otherwise emasculated husband moves to Stepford Conneticutt to fix their marriage, only to be inducted into a society of men who want their alpha female wives to become subservient.Here's the problem, I guess. The 1975 version came out when the thought of sexual equality was still frightening to many men. Today, it is accepted everywhere except maybe Utah. So the women involved have to be portrayed as nasty creatures no man but a masochist would want to be married to. (It is implied Children are involved, but the kids in this film are nothing more than dressing.) Another point. Are the "Stepford Wives" here supposed to be robots, or the real women with microchips installed in their brains so they will be more compliant? The film is never clear (a sign of truly bad scriptwriting) and it doesn't even become clear at the climax, where the heroine and her husband decide to undo the program.- Edit- After doing some research, I discovered that in fact the script was rewritten to give it a 'happier' ending. This explains the robot/microchip discrepancy. Of course, it just makes the film worse, because it is a HUGE plot hole. The thing is that there are some REALLY talented actors involved in this film! Bette Midler, Nicole Kidman, Matthew Brodderick, Christopher Walken, Glen Close. These people CAN do good work. Why not a one of them stood up and said, "This is crap, and I'm not doing it!" boggles the mind.This is the problem in Hollywood where writers have very little control over their properties once they go into "development". That is really what needs to change.</fullReview>

So its seems to me that the original intention was to cut the movie like this in the first place yet they didn't this made me think were their budget constraints as I can't be bothered to watch it with commentary. Anyway wouldn't affect the film in itself as its nothing special and Miss Kidman is much better than this take "To Die For" as an example of her finest hour, though the blame is not at her door, the whole casting is wrong, maybe unknowns would have been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A triumph of production design and colorful costumes, but otherwise a hot mess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ira Levin's slim, but creepy, novel is given a second filming in this broadly comic version, which sorely misses the mark. Kidman plays a hot-shot TV exec who falls apart after losing her high-paying and high-profile job. Her husband Broderick, also in the TV biz though in a lesser capacity, moves her to the idyllic little town of Stepford, Connecticut where they move into a stunning house amidst similar incredible homes, all populated by successful and seemingly happy couples. The husbands lean towards the geeky, but the wives are all glamorous, pristine ladies who keep immaculate homes and who are obsessed with anything and everything that makes a household beautiful. Kidman finds a friend in frazzled, unkempt author Midler who has recently moved to Stepford with her husband Lovitz. They also befriend one half of the town's lone gay couple, Bart, whose partner prefers to keep company with the gentlemen of Stepford at their somewhat ominous Men's Club. These three can't fathom what makes the ladies of Stepford tick, but Kidman and Midler really begin to worry when Bart suddenly begins to reject his own true personality and adopts one closer to his partner's liking. Eventually, Kidman discovers some unhappy truths about the town her husband has chosen for her and may not be able to escape with her life intact! Director Oz and screenwriter Rudnick have stripped any and all suspense and dread away from the story, supplanting it with plenty of wisecracks, over-the-top imagery and dialogue and obnoxious special effects which take away from the simple, gut-wrenching feeling of the source novel and the original 1975 film. Apart from that, they tampered around with their own misguided story, resulting in a film that makes so sense whatsoever in the final cut and winds up being an insult to anyone with a brain. This film is a monument to the dangers of test audiences and of trying to please everyone in lieu of sticking to a creative vision. It's a shame because this movie wastes a lot of really dazzling sets and costumes along with a few decent performances. Kidman does her best with a badly written character. (How can an audience care about a woman's fate as a Stepford Wife when her own personality and demeanor is so annoying and in one's face to begin with?) She has moments of likability, but it's hard to warm up to her after that dreadful opening. Broderick is appropriately weaselly and nerdy, but he and Kidman share very little chemistry, making their couple one that is tough to root for. Midler has some decent moments, but seems out of place. Her off-screen discord with Kidman doesn't help generate much chemistry between the two either. Close plays the town matriarch and looks fantastic. She also gives a very strong performance until one of the film's several rotten endings basically does her in. Walken plays her husband, a domineering sort who acts as a kind of leader for the town. He's creepy enough, but is also undone by the film's disjointedness. Hill makes her big screen debut here and isn't called upon to do much more than look pretty, which she does well. The two children in the film are treated as less than an afterthought. What could have been a sparkling and effective movie is hampered fatally by a lack of sensibility in the concept. What actually happens to the women of Stepford is anybody's guess, but the resolution offered in the film's denouement certainly doesn't match up to what was shown beforehand. The big twist at the end is completely senseless and idiotic. Enough of the target audience for the movie would not have seen the version from 30 years prior for this to have simply stuck more closely to the storyline without mucking it up. The 1975 film was a reaction to women's lib, but this one could have been a reaction to the overriding need for women to stay young and/or have surgery in order to stave off old age. It could also have been chilling and reflective. The decision to make it a comedy was a bad one as there is really nothing funny about men trying to make their wives into playthings, complete with remote control. The attempt to update it by adding a gay couple actually turns out to be more insulting than intended. Gays have spent years trying to play down the stereotype that in each couple, "one is the man and one is the woman". Thanks Rudnick, for setting the clock backwards. It was a thoughtless move. The only thoughts to come out of this version are the questions, "Why was it made?" and "What were they thinking?" An even more CGI heavy version of the film was trimmed before general release, though the scenes appear on the DVD. Broderick and Midler were replacements for John and Joan Cusack, who left the production early on due to a family situation.</fullReview>

As for the movie, it was really quite a lemon,,,,,too long to make a simple statement about human/womens rights.

		<fullReview>SPOILERS AHEADAnother day, another reimagination of a perfectly good book/film (delete as applicable). I came in with mixed expectations concerning this one (had many good attributes- Glenn Close, Nicole Kidman, Frank Oz, Jon Lovitz, and also many bad ones- Bette Midler, Bette Midler, Bette Midler and Matthew Broderick). I came out with a feeling of disgust.Most of the problems with the movie derive from the script. We're supposed to be believe these women are having their personality and individuality sacrificed, which is fine. However, these woman come across as stereotypes, and horribly unbelievable ones, before the Stepfordisation of them, starts. Nicole is the career-fixated woman, who hasn't got any time for her family or husband. Midler is the "kooky" individualist. The film becomes even more crass with a grotesque depiction of a gay couple, seemingly stuck in there for cheap, offensive laughs.As a satire it also is doomed from the beginning. Oz wants to discuss the increasing feeling of male powerlessness in a changing world, where men see their traditional role as provider, threatened by women. A final twist or two near the end reverses this however, rendering any social commentary completely superfluous, and if anything, in a strangely conservative turn, actually re-asserting traditional family values.But it's Hollywood, I hear you cry. Does it need to be intellectual? It's got big stars, who all seem comfortable in their roles, it has some genuinely funny laughs, a memorable title sequence and generally manages to sustain your interest for its 93 minutes. It's entertaining, so why want more? Because the film has pretensions for more. It wants to discuss more, but is caught up in political correctness, campy comedy and lazy writing.It could have been a great modern update of a 70s cult fave. However, The Stepford Wives sinks under the weight of the issues it raises, leaving the audience with more questions than answers, mixed messages and an absolutely atrocious final 15 minutes, which seems to undermine everything that went before, and then some. Wait for the DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nonsense! (Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Stepford Wives" is a profoundly stupid film. The plot is this: high-powered businesswoman Joanne (Nicole Kidman) suffers a nervous breakdown after losing her job in TV. Her slightly-less-but-still-very-high-powered husband Walter (Ferris Bueller) suggests that they and their two children move out of New York to the country, to repair their marriage and restart their lives in a more relaxed fashion. So they move to a perfect house in Stepford, itself apparently the perfection of small-town America.Stepford combines all the benefits of hi-tech ultra-modern living (the toilets automatically test their urine for blood-sugar levels), with all the wholesome old-fashioned American values of eating roast turkey on thanksgiving day while the stars-and-stripes flutters outside. Soon though, the keen-minded Joanne begins to wonder about Stepford, specifically about the womenfolk of Stepford: how is it that they all look like models, and behave and dress like the housewife from a 1950s waffle-iron advert? Why do they spend all their time arranging flowers and doting on their drooling idiotic husbands? More to the point, why do they all speak and move in synch? And why do they sometimes start repeating the same phrase over and over again in a mechanized voice whilst sparks fly out of their heads? And so it is that Joanne plus her comedy sidekicks: Bobbie, the awkward feminist Jewish intellectual; and Roger, the fashion-conscious happy-go-lucky gay guy (each amusingly played, by Bette Midler and Roger Bart respectively) begin to probe beneath the surface to discover Stepford's dark secret, a secret as laughably implausible as it is blindingly obvious: all the wives in Stepford are in fact robots (or at least have undergone brain-surgery to replace their personalities with a remote-control-husband-obedience system, the film seems unable to make up its mind). Glen Close plays Claire, the town matriarch, every inch the 1950s domestic goddess, and Christopher Walken is totally type-cast as her husband Mike: the evil commander-in-chief of The Campaign To Turn Women (And Gay Men) Into Robots. The whole thing is directed in a slightly stilted way to give the B-Movie feeling of the 1970s original. Presumably this is to maximise the extent to which the audience are prepared to suspend their disbelief, but this is exactly where the film fails. I have no objection to assuming all the necessary technological advances, it's simply that behaviour of the human characters in the film doesn't ring true. In fact, it misses its mark by miles and miles and miles. Take for instance the character of Walter. In the first section of the film he is portrayed as an intelligent, sympathetic, sensitive man who loves his wife so much that he quits his job so he can move to the country and spend more time with her. After a few days jealous exposure to the men of Stepford and their wives, he begins to wonder whether being sympathetic and sensitive is all that it's cracked up to be. Then one day in the Stepford Mens' Association, the the wives' true nature is revealed to him (in a particularly idiotic fashion). So what does he do? What would any man do? Run horrified to the police? Think that he must have lost his mind, and commit himself to a mental hospital? No, he begins to wonder when and how he can have Joanna similarly robotized. It's total nonsense.There's considerably more hole than plot, but the hole twists and turns predictably until Joanne herself is indeed due to be robotized. She emerges from the machine with Barbie-doll blonde hair and grinning vacantly, but after a few more inconsequential hole-twists it inevitably turns out that she's only been faking the robot-thing, and in fact Walter heroically backed out at the last moment, thereby proving himself to be "a real man". Then he saves humanity in 30 seconds flat by pressing a few convenient buttons in the machine, and reversing the whole process so that all the women in town revert to their former selves and ask their husbands what the f*** they thought they were playing at.If it were not so easily dismissed, the sociological premises of the film would be appallingly offensive. All right, I'm prepared to accept that many men would indeed like their wives or girlfriends to look like catwalk models, and some may even think that it's right and proper that their wives do all the cooking and cleaning while they sit on their fat arses smoking cigars. But there can't be many who would genuinely prefer to wake up to the vacant (not to say entirely sinister) emotionless visage of a robot, than that of the person they love. Even fewer still could be so psychopathic as to be prepared to trick their wives into intrusive personality-erasing brain-surgery. Yet, the film assures us, many, if not most men, would want exactly that. The problem with this film is not that it is stupid (many of my favourite films are deeply - and deliberately - stupid), but that it wants to be taken far more seriously than it deserves. Where The Stepford Wives does succeed, it is with humour: some of the dialogue is very funny, and there are good moments too when the heroes are confronted by some of the robots' more eccentric behaviour. Bobbie is their very antithesis, whereas Roger, with his obsession with camp style fits right in. If they had concentrated on playing it for laughs, this would have a far better film. Sadly though, someone involved clearly thought that it had an important message to convey. But what? "A real man" doesn't murder his wife and replace her with her own re-animated corpse? You don't say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much telling, no showing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though at times I was laughing, overall this film only tells and never shows. For example, we are TOLD that Broderick and Kidman's marriage is deteriorating, yet there are no scenes filmed to give us such evidence. A very rushed film with barely any chemistry between Kidman and Broderick. It appears as if Frank Oz was a little lazy. Rent it for 3.00 rather than seeing it in.Kidman should continue to do deep, dramatic films.She has no talent for comedy.Broderick is a putz and a tool. I was lucky to not have seen him in anything for so long.What was SJP thinking?Bette Midler was great though, along with her gay friend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unimpressive Satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Oz, who also directed Bowfinger has a tendency to make very uneven and over the top films. Bowfinger, the other film I saw that he directed was uneven and over the top but it was also very funny. The Stepford Wives, a remake of a film from the 1970s really is a departure from the original film. This movie tries to be a satire, but it is not very funny. The movie tries to be a thriller but it is not very scary, the movie is not very cohesive and only of fair quality. Nicole Kidman is the put upon housewife in this remake. She is a network executive who has a nervous breakdown after being fired from her job. They move to lovely Stepford, Connecticut where everything is too prefect. I think from here the plot is fairly well-known. The jokes are just not funny. They try to be very satirical, but they just don't work. The script doesn't work at all so I'm surprised that this movie works at all. One thing this cast manages to do is have an incredible cast. Nicole Kidman, Matthew Broderick, Faith Hill, Bette Midler, Jon Lovitz, Glenn Close, Christopher Walken, and Faith Hill. Walken does good as always, Lovitz is pretty good, Glenn Close is excellent, but that is about as far as the quality performances go. Bette Midler had has many good roles, but she seems miscast here. Matthew Broderick seems to be sleepwalking through this role, Faith Hill is pretty much there for her nice figure, her blonde hair and her big? well you can figure the rest out. Nicole Kidman is one of the most overrated actresses today. I have seen a number of movies with her she cannot act. She is only popular because she is so attractive. She does not do a good job at all in this film. Her performance is awful. I will admit the film did make we want to see what was next, it kept my attention. I guess the best the thing about this movie was that it was the worst movie I have seen that kept my attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A hilarious supporting turn from Roger Bart helps make The Stepford Wives a pretty good dark (lightly dark) comedy, but it really made me just to want to see the darker original. Bart gets most of the big laughs as Roger Bannister, a Stepford wife for the new millennium, and Bette Midler grabs a few chuckles as Bobbie Markowitz, who along with Nicole Kidman as Joanna Eberhard, make up the foils for the perfect Stepford community. This film has a few points in it where it could have taken a darker turn, and made for a more unique comedy-horror, but it chose to stay the straight and narrow, and like I mentioned before, it makes me want to see the original, which from what I hear plays it differently.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stepford Wives is a feeble attempt at a comedy-thriller. It contains some very funny moments, but not enough to carry the movie, and I can recall only one real scare in the whole movie.What I do remember is the look on Nicole Kidman's face at the end of the opening sequence, when her old life is starting to fall apart. It is a long, drawn-out close-up that deserves to be made into a short.At the moment, Nicole is an actress in a class of her own, as this scene shows. Unfortunately, it is not enough reason to go watch the movie, unless you are in a silly mood and have the right company. The rest of you will have to wait for that scene to be made into a short.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wives are back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a big fan of the TV movies of The Stepford Wives. Way before big budget special effects and mega salaries The Stepford Wives managed to convey a spooky, creepy, futuristic message that played well for the time it came out. When I went to see this version of the Stepford Wives I was wondering how the producers would handle the subtle suspense that the TV movies pulled off. Five minutes into the movie it was apparent that all of the subtle creepiness was replaced with a dark comedic tone and it worked well...for the most part.Nicole Kidman plays a studio executive that created a reality show that caused one of the contestants to go postal, Kidman gets fired, has a nervous breakdown and moves to Stepford with her husband and kids to start allover. Of course Kidman deduces that all the wives in Stepford are gorgeous and obedient and the husbands are mediocre and obnoxious. The Stepford carnival is being run by Glenn Close and Christopher Walken, two names I never thought I would mention in the same sentence. Better yet Matthew Broderick plays Kidman's husband and Bette Midler shows up to play a neurotic New Yorker, typecasting at its best. Stepford Wives was entertaining and even funny when Kidman, Midler and a gay neighbor were intent on finding out what the hell was going on in Stepford. This trio produced some genuine laughs and you couldn't help but cheer for them as they stumble around Stepford like amateur sleuths. I only wish the movie would have stayed on that course a little longer. When the jig is finally up the movie turned into a preachy, over dramatic "hollywood movie". I have to admit something here. Nicole Kidman did a great job and showed that she can do comedy very well. She was over the top and hilarious and subdued and sarcastic, her appearance seemed to change right before your eyes when the script called for it. I am not a huge fan of hers but she was pretty good in this movie. Midler was Midler and that's a good thing,Walken was Walken and that's sometimes a good thing. Glenn Close surprised me the most, she was charmingly disturbing as the hostess of Stepford and she pulled it off with ease, good to see her back on screen. Stepford as whole was not bad, didn't blow me away but it wasn't bad, the first and second acts were entertaining but the payoff was lacking. Not saying that it was bad but the journey was a lot more fun than the destination.Flixking</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More hype than quality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit, I was quite excited to see this movie. The previews made it look absolutely thrilling, funny, and just all around worth it.I saw it last night, so it's fresh in my mind.The cast, as far as talent and quality goes, is well chosen. I've never been a big fan of Nicole Kidman, but I respected her in this one. Christopher Walken was very much playing HIS role, something he was meant to play. Glenn Close could have been better. There wasn't much Matthew Brodrick (spelling on that last name might be wrong) could do to up his role anymore than he already did in the final product, since his character wasn't very deep. And Bette Midler was wonderful. Really. She's hysterical, since she was most of the comic relief of the film.The ironies between real life and Stepford are well played up, and I will admit, the ending surprised me (though Glenn Close has a monologue at the end that didn't thoroughly impress me as much as I thought it would).Now, for the sad news.It's not nearly as fast-paced as I thought it would be. Not that you want a movie to be so fast that you can't understand it, but I felt it was really slow, or at least, lacking energy. It wasn't very witty, and though I haven't seen the original, I've been told it was scary. If this one had been, it MIGHT have upped the quality, though I'm not entirely positive.Maybe I'm slightly biased because I was hyped up by the previews, where it looked better. Maybe had I not seen the previews and saw the movie alone, I might have liked it. But it was a downer, a disappointed.As for the whole "feminist view" that the movie portrays...I'm not a raging feminist myself, but I still wasn't that affected by it. I don't think that either side on that issue will be extremely rattled by the message either way. The resolution of the movie lets women be successful in a male-dominant world, while still letting them take the pants sometimes. And that was fine. Nothing earth-shattering, no one's going to storm out of the theatre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revenge of the nerds...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it says something about the state of modern feminism that this remake of THE STEPFORD WIVES barely touches on the topic and when it does it is with a sharp taste of sarcasm. The voice of feminism is represented by Bette Midler as Bobbie Markowitz, an old style feminist who comes dressed in baggy sweat shirts and an extra-large chip on her shoulder. She is the type of person who thinks that being outspokenly rude and being honest are synonymous terms. Of course, with Milder playing the part, she's a real hoot, even if the portrayal isn't all that flattering. But this Bobbie would never have made it into the original 1975 version of Ira Levin's novel; in that film all the "real" women were moody and dissatisfied. The 1975 film starring Katherine Ross was a taut, tidy, cleverly made little thriller, but it was also a downer. The film gave us two choices as far as women were concerned: depressed and unfulfilled victims or vacuous and robotic domestic slaves. I don't think anyone would buy that today, not even the feminists.So the 2004 models of THE STEPFORD WIVES have rolled off the assembly line with a sense of humor and a wider array of emotional attitudes. The film itself takes the original plot -- family moves to a town where all the women are just too, too happy as homemakers -- but instead of playing it as a dark satirical sci-fi thriller, it is played, surprisingly well, as a broad satirical comedy. In fact, The Stepford Wives themselves show signs of having undergone an extensive makeover as well, though it is the "before" not the "after" images that have changed. The women who have been accepted into Stepford society are pretty much the same as in the previous film, except instead of being cold mindlessly polite Martha Stewart types they are now cheerful mindlessly polite Martha Stewart types, sort like Jessica Simpson pretending to be Martha Stewart. But the big change with the new version is that the story doesn't beg us to pity the "before" women who come to Stepford, Conn. The aforementioned Midler is amusing enough, but her character is really an obnoxious pig. Another "wife" is Roger (Roger Bart), half of Stepford's token gay couple; he falls just about one "FAB-ulous!!!" and a drag scene short of being a total stereotype (though one has to wonder if it isn't just a bit homophobic for gay screenwriter Paul Rudnick to assume that if you have a gay couple, one of them has to be "the wife."). And then there is Nicole Kidman as Joanna Eberhard. Instead of being the lost lamb that Ross played, Kidman's character is an abrasive high-powered network executive and the queen of tacky reality programming. Two of her big hits are "Balance of Power" and "I Can Do Better," though either could just as easily have been entitled "Emasculate Your Husband." What she would call entertainment, a psychologist might call a castration complex. The woman has issues concerning men, the brunt of which is born by her devoted, but frustrated husband, played by Matthew Broderick. Indeed, we discover that all of The Stepford Wives were at one time powerful dominating women with husbands who -- in a telling bit of role reversal -- come to resent being taken for granted and belittled. Never underestimate a nerd with a grudge; this is their revenge. In a way, this version of THE STEPFORD WIVES is braver and more honest because it doesn't pander to the good-woman/bad-man brand of feminism. Both the men and the women come to this battle of the sexes well armed with their own resentments. And the men aren't portrayed as just being controlling monsters, but as men trying to regain their self esteem and heal their battered egos. In the 1975 film, we could never understand just why any man could resort to a Stepford solution; this version at least offers a motive, however weak. When Joanna's husband is faced with the decision of whether to Stepfordize his wife, we understand that it isn't just a power trip, but a last desperate -- and perverse -- attempt to save his faltering marriage. And we're not so sure that it is all that bad of an idea.Indeed, one of the points the film makes (in one its several twist endings) is that there is more than one way to be a Stepford Wife. Instead of being a slave to domesticity, Joanna is a slave to a corporate mentality. When we meet Joanna, she is already in a Stepford mode: coldly, insincerely cheerful and mechanically indifferent to suffering, not unlike her character in TO DIE FOR. Kidman even plays the part with the same robotic body language that would soon be on display in Stepford. Other than being a lot more sexy, her post-Stepford persona isn't all that different. It is revealing that it takes a nervous breakdown (like a mechanical malfunction) to make her character seem human. The term "Stepford Wife" has gained iconic status, a smug way of putting down a woman who takes pride in her home and family. A term of liberal sexist bigotry. But the new STEPFORD WIVES argues -- indirectly, in a backhanded, ironic, twisted way -- that a Stepford existence isn't that bad, if that is what you want. And it may be preferable to being successful and unhappy. If you're going to be blindly devoted to something, it might as well be home and family rather than to a corporate hierarchy.This STEPFORD WIVES is not perfect: there are large holes in the plot and inconsistencies in the details, far more questions are raise than answers supplied, and there are way too many false endings. (And for the record, there should be a law banning any more cameo appearances by Larry King!) But to the film's credit it rethinks the original material and realizes that the bugaboos of gender stereotyping are more to be laughed at rather than frightened by and the film adjusts its attitude accordingly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Listen very closely. I am going to give you advice that may save your sanity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THIS REVIEW PRESENTED TO YOU SPOILER FREE! Unless you count the revealing of how Christopher Walken works his trademark dance into the film. But that will be noted as such, when the time comes.Rent this movie. Watch the first half of it. Stop it right after Stepford's terrible secret (which you almost undoubtedly know, but which I still will not reveal for the sake of my own spoiler-free guarantee) is seen enacted for the first time. However much your very soul may cry out for the remainder of the movie, ignore it. If you have any respect for the original film, I guarantee you'll thank me.For those few brave souls who do not heed my warnings, here are a few more words, just to give you an idea of what you're in for:The thing about this movie is that it's over-the-top. In parts, this is a very good thing. My review of the first film could not say enough about its wonderful subtlety, and brilliantly nuanced thrills. The problem is that the popularity of the original movie has made the concept of "Stepford Wives" such a cliché that doing it as straight thriller just wouldn't work anymore. And so instead, it goes the satire route. The tone for the film is set early on with clips from two prototype reality shows depicting the battle of the sexes at its most outrageous. At the time, I thought maybe it went a little TOO far; but it does give us a clear picture of what we're in for in the rest of the film.Then we move to Stepford and meet the fabled Stepford Wives. The mannerisms of the original Stepford Wives I found quite amusing. The mannerisms of the new Stepford Wives had me nearly falling out of my chair with laughter. Glenn Close is clearly having a marvelous time, as is Bette Midler. And, at that point, so was I.Going on the assumption that most people already know the terrible secret of Stepford, if not from the original movie or book, then at least from popular culture of the past 30 years, the remake doesn't bother trying to keep it hidden from us, but rather shows us early on exactly what's happening, and tries to do as many outrageous (and hilarious) things as possible with it. In fact, even before the "secret" is revealed (as well as a number of times after) we are treated to some terrific inside jokes, for people who are familiar with the source material, and know what's coming. This half the film was the best time I've had at a theater in ages.The problem comes when they try (quite suddenly) to drop the satire, and let the "thriller" part of the movie kick in. But even with the humour gone, the over-the-top tone remains. The film has its tongue stuck so far into its cheek that the more it tries to pull it out, the further in it gets. Thus, there are no thrills, because the film is so over-the-top that it's impossible to take seriously. There is no humour anymore, because it's been abandoned in favor of thrills. My interest in the film has been reduced to wondering when and how Christopher Walken will work in his signature dance steps (DANCE SPOILER: He doesn't actually tap-dance, but he and Glenn Close have a brief waltz towards the end. END DANCE SPOILER). Somewhere in this mess, the satirical aspect of the movie begins again, but the damage has already been done. There are a few minor laughs left, but they are not enough. The film has become a train wreck in progress. All that remains is for us to look and see exactly how far tongue can be rammed into cheek against its will. You would not believe me if I told you how far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Take: The comical and satirical tone proves to be more than appropriate in this 2nd screen incarnation of Ira Levin's novel. If you ask me, I prefer seeing Ira Levin's THE STEPFORD WIVES, on the screen, as a comedy. It might have worked in the novel (you tell me, I haven't read it yet), I haven't seen the 1975 original either, but exactly how scary can these wives be on the screen, seeing them dressed with Barbie doll-gowns and talking in soft-natured voices. If it might have worked on the novel, it will definitely lose something on the screen. It's fun to see the creators of this new version of Levin's story who lighten it up a little. Although criticized, this remake of THE STEPFORD WIVES is enjoyable lighter entertainment with a lot of laughs thrown it for good cause (and effect).Nicole Kidman, who has not gone to much roles in years, gives a delightful performance as Joanna Eberhart, a sassy New Yorker, who is fired from her career as VP of a successful TV studio after having problems with one of their sexist TV shows. To cure her from totally loosing her self, his husband Walter (Matthew Broderick) takes her and their kids to move to Stepford, Connecticut, where everything is perfect. And where perfect isn't always good. As Joanna discovers, when the wives are just too darn perfect. Kudos for the delightful script by Paul Rudnick, for providing a lot of laughs (instead of scares). Much of the film relies on his script, and manages to make them all work. I can honestly say Rudnick almost owns this movie, but director Frank Oz also provides his own mastery to provide the film with bizarre special effects and outlandish looks (I never felt Connecticut to be this, well, perfect). The cast also give their terrific contributions, enjoyable performances and the lot. Although Kidman is adorable as ever, my vote (for the best) is Glenn Close as one of the wives. Close is really good in this roles and, for not seeing her in this kind of performance (since 101 DALMATIANS), she's a delight. Bette Midler proves, once again, that singing isn't the only thing she does best. Although thumbs are mostly down for this movie, I give this film a major thumbs up. Some people (critics and public alike) are so used to liking the originals over their remakes, they tend to forget that not all of them are bad. THE STEPFORD WIVES is not one of these bad remakes, and for those who thought so, may want to give this another chance.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, this movie was pretty good, funny, and mildly awkward (kidman and Broderick are to blame), but it is an insult to the book. I understand that it was supposed to be a comedy, but it completely missed the point of the story.First of all, the casting was awful. Kidman and Broderick were awkwardly cast as Joanna and Walter. Kidman came off as some controlling jerk, when in the book, she is somewhat controlling, but a good and involved mother and wife. Broderick's portrayal of Walter was lazy and off target, making him unlikeable and weak. Walter is basically portrayed as weak and easily swayed, when in the book he and his wife are a pretty equal team until he is slowly seduced into the idea of a perfect spouse. Kidman is awkward in her part and lost in this movie. Don't get me wrong, she's an excellent actress, but weak in comedy. The only characters that really hit a chord with the book were Bobbi and Mike(who wasn't used enough at ALL)Secondly, the story is inconsistent. At the beginning, it makes it appear as though the wives are robots. For example, Bobbi (Midler) puts her hand on a stove burner while talking to Joanna, and feels nothing. Somehow in the middle of the story, it changes pace and it turns out that the women's brains were altered. The director tried to pull a fast one on the audience, and it didn't work out.Thirdly, most of the characters were either altered or pushed to the side in this adaptation of the Stepford Wives. It did a decent job of modernizing the film, but in making it a comedy, lost the magic of the original. This story was meant to be serious and meaningful. My advice is to watch the movie to enjoy it, and not pay any attention to the name.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The last part of the film is the best part</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last part's the best part because Glenn Close finally takes charge of everything, at least for a few moments of Martha Stewart Goes Bananas (On Camera) sheer exhilaration. One of her best roles in ages; I would have preferred to have seen more of her and less of Kidman's boring butch version of Joanna Eberhardt, a role that will forever be linked to Katharine Ross' superior original! Bette Midler seems to be trying to have fun with her role but, I gotta tell ya, her Stepford persona is so like the one she took on since "Wind Beneath My Wings" rejuvenated her career 15 years ago. Seeing her in full Whoopi drag -- shaggy hair, granny shades, faded rock t-shirt -- was truly bizarre. Not surprisingly, the men in the movie with the exception of Roger Bart's screaming queen hubby of David Marshall Grant (at his smarmiest) are all complete ciphers. There is nothing remotely menacing about Chris Walken's paint-by-number performance here; he acts more like a mediocre SNL player doing an imitation Christopher Walken. Beautiful former dreamboat Matt Broderick is a drip and a wimp with an impressive torso one wishes he had actually bared to get some of the much-missed sex in this picture. There were no sex scenes!! I couldn't believe it. I at least expected non-acting (and non-singing) type Faith Hill to have an on-cam bedroom sequence but all we hear is her screaming orgasmically; she's on-key so we know she isn't singing.... A better ending to this film would have had all of these successful women replace their schlub husbands with mecha studs ala Jude Law in "A.I.", but the filmmakers didn't even have the balls or the imagination to go there. Note to Paul Rudnick: please rethink your career before it's too late. George Cukor you ain't, hun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stepford Wives Not Really An Update Or Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicole Kidman and Matthew Broderick are a couple that eschew life in the big city for the quiet, idyllic life of Stepford, Connecticut. When they arrive there, Kidman quickly finds the town and its inhabitants not to her liking. Broderick is uncertain as to what to make of it, but eventually comes around. Bette Midler and Jon Lovitz are another couple, just as oddly matched, who befriend Kidman. The town is led by Glenn Close for the women and the always creepy Christopher Walken for the men. They, in turn, are also a couple. It seems like there are a lot of comparisons being made to the original film from 1975, which really had a more serious focus than this. This film is supposed to be more humorous and tongue in cheek. One could argue with how successful or not that is accomplished. The cast of the film is impressive on paper, but what they're given to work with in terms of a script and a plot leaves us wanting more...more clarity, more satire, more tension, and...well...more humor. After all that has happened in the last few decades in terms of men and women, I'm wondering why the movie offers little in the way of topical humor besides potshots at AOL and Microsoft. Maybe it's because the movie had little to say beyond what was said before. In that case, why update the film or remake it? It's made watchable by the stars until the second half of the movie. After that, plot holes open, contradicting details we've already seen. It looks like there were last minute changes made that don't mesh well with the rest of the movie. However, there are some funny moments in the movie, mostly involving Walken; his promotional film within a film of Stepford is very funny. **1/2 of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shouldn't a parody be funny?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this 6 out of 10 because I quite enjoyed it. Highlights were the performances of Roger Bart, Glenn Close and - at times - Nicole Kidman. The script was hardly sparkling but there were some comic moments - the book club scene, for example.But I cannot accept that this is such a good parody that logic can be allowed to fly out of the window. Supporters have slated critics who pointed out that the film is riddled with inconsistencies. But no one can deny that there is a major inconsistency here, when we are first told that the women have been replaced by robots and later that, no, they were simply the victims of mind control that can be reversed remotely.After watching the deleted scenes on the DVD and listening to Frank Oz's commentary on the film (also on the DVD), I came away thinking that he didn't have a clear idea of what it was meant to be. He said that the scene with Bette Middler as lawnmower was deleted because it was too comedic, when he wanted something darker. I thought the deleted scene was quite entertaining and that, if we are asked to excuse the gaffes because IT'S JUST A PARODY, it should have been kept in. Oz does talk about continuity in his commentary, but it's at the micro level - ensuring that remote controls are in the correct hand when filming resumes, giving Kidman the same hairstyle when she returns for something filmed during post-production - and not at macro scale.But despite the best efforts of Midler, Bart and Close this really wasn't that funny. I laughed at the AOL joke (even though I'm a loyal customer) but it wasn't that original. The opening scenes, with reality TV shows, were quite promising, but after that it was downhill all the way.If this had been a lot funnier I would have forgiven the macro scale continuity howlers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Stepford" as robotic as its wives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Stepford Wives", in a similar fashion to the film "Pleasantville", sets out to be a satirical comedy, lampooning the ideals of the 1950s--specifically, the perfect homemaker wife. Unfortunately, quite unlike "Pleasantville", "The Stepford Wives" fails miserably.Contrary to the claims made by the posters and trailers for the film, the plot of "The Stepford Wives" is no secret. No thanks to the trailers which reveal many of the films secrets, most moviegoers will already be familiar with the mystery of Stepford.That said, the story revolves around Joanna, a highly ambitious and incredibly successful television executive. Her career comes to an abrupt end when one of the reality shows from her new fall lineup causes disaster. In an attempt to save his wife's sanity, Joanna's husband, Walter moves her and their kids to the gated-community of Stepford ? a town with "no crime, no poverty, and no pushing." But, of course, the reason Stepford and its women are so perfect lies in the fact that they are robots ... or are they? One of the main problems the audience must face while watching "The Stepford Wives" is the enormous plot holes, especially in the case of the wives, who seem to change from robots to normal women with brain alterations and back again whenever the plot calls for it. Or rather, to whichever is funnier at the given moment. The issue is, robots or not, it's NOT funny, and most certainly not clever, as a satire should be.The film shows promise in the first act, as we are first introduced to the bizarre antics of the wives (partaking in homemaker aerobics, "Let's be washing-machines!" and discussing the "controversial" Christmas crafts book during their book club sessions). As we reach the second act however, the film shifts gears into breakneck speed, (with each sequence lasting no more than five minutes) as we watch Joanna slowly solve the mystery of Stepford. This might have been more engaging had the audience not already been aware of the secret long before Joanna.As "The Stepford Wives" crawls into the ending stretch, it backpedals, rapidly unraveling with one twist piled onto another in an attempt to keep the audience guessing. Sadly, it only confuses us more, until, finally, the plot is so convoluted we can no longer tell what's going on.The movie constantly contradicts itself, right until the bitter end. Some say to enjoy a comedy, you must suspend disbelief--I agree, but in the case of "The Stepford Wives", the comedy is almost non-existent. The film had so much potential, but inevitably, fell short.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has some fun elements</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a secret in 'The Stepford Wives' that deals with the Stepford wives which I will not reveal, even though it is hardly a secret anymore. If you do not know it already, you will realize it very early in the film through some quite funny scenes.Joanna (Nicole Kidman), just fired, her husband played by Matthew Broderick and her two children move to Stepford where things are not as they seem. Or actually things are exactly as they seem; weird. Joanna becomes friends with Bobbie (Bette Midler), a writer, and Roger (Roger Bart), a gay man. It seems the unofficial mayer of Stepford is Mike (Christopher Walken) who's wife Claire (Glenn Close) is sort of the leader of the women from Stepford. Yes, things are weird in Stepford.So we slowly learn the secret, Nicole Kidman does that as well. The film seems constantly silly and the ending was pretty bad but when it was over I realized something. Most of the time I was smiling while watching this film. I was smiling because of the weird events, the funny lines especially from Midler, and because of Walken, although I have to admit the last couple of years he always makes me smile. 'The Stepford Wives' may be silly, it is quite some fun as well. Since the film is not that long it does not become boring, just some simple entertainment.</fullReview>

This remake seemed intended as satire but some thought-provoking elements carried over from the original work. Maybe it's a cliché, but many people are disappointed in themselves or others if they don't match an "ideal," and advertising and genetic engineering could undoubtedly exploit this. Good acting, especially a brilliant Nicole Kidman. The original movie was good, so I'm glad it was changed significantly; otherwise, why bother (although a little less information at the end about "how they did it" wouldn't have bothered me; most of the script was cleverly funny).</fullReview>

There is an abundance of talent on the screen and behind the scenes, but the movie really doesn't amount to much. Apart from Kidman and Matthew Broderick (as her husband), the actors seem to be operating in cheese mode. Every performance is over the top, none more so than that of Glenn Close. Her perpetual happiness was a major nuisance. The movie is a little entertaining in its campiness, but it tries too hard to achieve this. It's really not funny and, apart from an unnecessary twist ending, the secret is spoiled going in. The original is such a staple of pop culture that there is no way to surprise the audience.</fullReview>

This 2004 was a good send-up, especially the early scene where a poor guy had spent a week with a gorgeous honey of a call girl, but only talked (because he loved his wife) - while she slept with about 10 incarnations of Mr. Universe. Needless to say, he was gutted... LOL. In a way, I think the film comes a little late in our evolution to have the sort of impact it could have. In the days when Feminism was raging would have been a better time for this film. All those women wearing 1950s outfits - the sort of thing my mother would have worn! Glenn Close looked fantastic.

		<fullReview>The Stepford Wives is about a young woman named Joanna Eberhard who is the executive of a television network. After being attacked by one of the deranged guests of a reality show she was working on she suffers a mental breakdown. Her husband played by the brilliant Matthew Broderick, takes the family to the Stepford Community to live. There Joanna meets some friends and neighbors who are more than average housewives. Overall it was a good movie, but it lacked in comparison with the first. It was an okay movie that could be enjoyed by fans of the first, as long as they don't go into the theatre expecting anything as dramatic or intense. The mental breakdown scene was my favourite part. The movie relied entirely on suspense to scare you, even though it wasn't really that scary, the suspense made it seem scarier. I enjoyed it and gave it a well deserved 6.0/10.0</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie quite amusing with quirky little one liners. I like the story too, it and has some sociological aspects about the decline of marriage and the depth of love, and is probably more relevant today than in 1975. There is 2 versions of the 2004 version, the cinema version is not as good, the original version has a better less happy ending in which they all stay as robots and is about 15 minutes longer due to there being more emphasis on them being robots rather than lobotomized with micro chips although this is important still. Either way this is a fun little movie in which everyone could enjoy. It is haloed with a strong cast including Matthew Broderick who is fantastic, Christopher Walken is as always his intimidating self and Niicole Kidman who plays the psycho career women well.Directing: 72% Acting: 85% Story: 74% Overall: 78%</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Competently made, if a little self-conscious and dated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, let me just make the following points: I have not seen the original movie (or, if I have, I do not remember it), but I do know the premise of the story, as a classic science fiction thriller. Furthermore, I did not go to the cinema intending to see it, but I ended up seeing it anyway.The makers of the movie seem very conscious of the fact that they are producing a re-make; I think that weakens it, as you cannot run forwards whilst continuously glancing over your shoulder.Glenn Close demonstrates, once again, what a marvelous character actress she is, although as she became more and more hysterical I began to expect her stuff a bunny in a pan of boiling water. Christopher Walken barely gets out of first gear - his acting is (appropriately!) robotic. Matthew Broderick is underused; for someone who was so good as Ferris Bueller I think that he could have been more effectively employed and his character fleshed out.There is some confusion (see the noticeboard) about whether the wives were real or robots. This arises from the original movie, in which the wives were replaced by synthetic versions of themselves (i.e. robots), which pleased their husbands as they were far more compliant, co-operative and harder-working than their live predecessors. In this version the wives (who are star women of industry etc) brains have silicon chips implanted in them that make them electronically controllable (by the husbands). So their bodies are as before, but their brains have been modified. Th exception to this is the Christopher Walken character, who really is a man-made (or actually, the Glenn Close character-made) robot!The moral dilemma of the movie is which is better - the clean, tidy, beautiful nirvana of the electronically controlled Stepford world or the grungy, disorganised real world. Glenn's character prefers the former, Nicole Kidman's character spends the film vacillating (look it up!) between the former and the latter. It comes down to a re-assessment of the idea of beauty, which, in the days of Charlie's Angels and leggy blonde's of the 1970's, was more of an adventurous concept to debate by means of film than it is almost 30 years later. Bette Midler does her best to demonstrate the two extremes; her "real world" house is a health and safety death trap and she dresses as if dragged through a hedge backwards, but when she is transformed her "Barbie Doll" version is a scary mimic of Glenn Close's.The ironic twist of this all is that Nicole Kidman looks incredibly sexy with short black hair at her very lowest point and similarly gorgeous as a brunette before her "transformation" into a much less attractive plastic blonde, which either undermines the argument of the film or justifies her stance, depending upon your point of view.Whilst no-one comes out of this film looking bad, the reputations of the main characters, with possibly Nicole excepted, will hardly have been enhanced by a notion that may have seemed plausible thirty years ago, but nowadays looks a little quaint.Alan F</fullReview>

Something, you wont have to think about but can enjoy.And so the film is just that, something you can go and spend a couple of hours watching, except the film finishes with you thinking you too have been through the 'Stepford experience' and missed about half an hour of the film.It is a good re-make updating the classic, although it has lost some of that psychological freakiness as opposed to the comedy that it is. The reasons for the families move are probably more thought-provoking.Go and see it if there's nothing else on, although check your watch frequently just to make sure that Stepford hasn't got you...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS**Reading through the other reviews on the site for this film, I'm reminded of what my Grandmother always says. 'This would be a very dull world if we all liked the same things.'How true.I find it difficult to believe that anyone can be complaining about the fact that this film is not scary enough. Yes, the original was more of a thriller. But from the opening scenes depicting Joanna's latest tv shows it's clear that this film is a comedy. And it's really funny! OK so I missed out on some of the US in jokes 'Connecticut, the only place they wouldn't notice a town full of robots'. However, there was more than enough international humour to keep the film going. I was laughing all the way through the the film. Where to begin? The titles of Bette Midler's books, Roger the hysterically camp gay stereotype, the book club, the exercises . .. .the robodog falling down the stairs(that one made me choke on my popcorn) Joanna's desperate attempts to fit in with her manic cupcake baking . . . .. . The laughs really did keep on coming. And whenever the film started to look like it was getting a little dark, it was immediately lightened up. And I know the Scooby Doo style ending has come in for some stick, but I really enjoyed it. Plus I've always been a bit scared of Christopher Walken. It makes sense that he's really a robot. The film had been rather clumsily edited and it wasn't clear whether the women were robots or mechanically controlled. However, plot consistency isn't really what this film was about. Maybe I'd have been disappointed if I'd seen the original and then this. But, like the Italian Job, Stepford Wives 2004 takes the ideas from the earlier film and uses them in a completely different way.And what a cast it has! Nicole Kidman plays it straight as the deeply confused Joanna, Matthew Broderick is still unbelievably cute and quite believable as he tries to fit in with the guys. Roger Bannister is incredibly funny, Bette Midler nicely understated and playing brilliantly off Jon Lovitz. 'Clean this house!' 'Clean it yourself!' However, it's Glenn Close and Christopher Walken who steal the film as the demented King and Queen of Stepford.A real treat.</fullReview>

The reason this film is so "bad" is because of the editing job. For some reason, scenes were changed and the film tried to change the plot (what exactly are the wives) The editing in the final version has scenes that were meant to show the other plot of "what are the wives" and it gets confusing. The one thing that worked with this was the ending was changed. (It didn't make sense in the test screening)The good thing is, that if you can look past the plot holes you can enjoy the film.

		<fullReview>I like the idea of remaking the feminist, 1975 horror film "The Stepford Wives" into a campy, satirical comedy. It could have been brilliant. But instead it's shallow, and the satire is obvious and ham-handed rather than daring, as it could have been. Nicole Kidman is good and it's great to see Matthew Broderick and Bette Midler on a screen again, and both are good. Some (not all) of the dialogue is quite clever and funny, especially early on, and it's never boring.But despite the fact that it's moderately entertaining throughout, the high number of wrong notes in the storyline, and especially a huge, HUGE hole in the plot that makes absolutely zero sense, ruin its chances for a recommendation. In a nutshell, it's not painful to watch (until the end), is well-acted and cast, but essentially worthless, and suffers from the most inexplicably huge plot hole I've seen in some time. The original ain't exactly a classic, but it's better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable... but I still liked it a lot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time today. It was a little bit predictable, but the twist at the end was pretty cool. (See it for yourself and you'll know what I'm talking about!) Basically, the plot is a family moves to a town (Stepford) where all the wives are seemingly perfect. The horrible truth is that the women have actually been "perfected" to their husbands' liking. All the actors were great- I've always been a huge fan of Nicole Kidman and I've always liked Bette Midler and Matthew Broderick, and now I'm a new fan of Roger Bart. And finally- for the first time in years- Christopher Walken is in a decent movie again. I guess I'm making a bigger deal out of this movie than I should be, but what can I say? I loved it. And if you pay very close attention, there's an excellent message in the movie. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicole Kidman is a talented actress but this kind of movie isn't her bag. Broderick, who is comic talent, was not given an ample opportunity to be funny based on the script. However, Bette Midler and Roger Bart were funny beyond words. They stole the show! This movie would have failed without them. It was really magic watching them add levity to the film's semi-dark atmosphere.Faith Hill is added as merely a "prop" in the background so I was unable to judge her performance. Once again Bart and Bette were the real ones to watch her. Wait until it comes on DVD, save your theater money for other films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>creepy satire, mediocre ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This works as a satire. It's also a bit creepy, but there's a fair amount of laughs.Nicole Kidman is a powerful, popular CEO of a TV studio that specializes in reality shows. Matthew Broderick plays one of her employees, a VP. Kidman gets fired and the family moves to the idyllic, pristine, gated community of Stepford, Connecticut. Early on, they realize that something weird is going on as the women are all like giddy airheads, always wearing dresses and high heels, while the men are relatively normal, if not a tad nerdy.This film makes some prickly comments about societal trends, hence its satirical side. Bette Midler is very funny. Glen Close looks badly preserved, Kidman and Broderick are fine and Christopher Walken is excellent. Due to the weak ending, this film falls short of being a must-see, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another 70s Sci-Fi remake mistake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take two things into account with this review.#1- The Stepford Wives movie from 1975 is one of my favourite movies.#2- I completely understood that this remake was going to be something different.In fact, I was so accepting of the fact that Frank Oz chose to make this a satirical comedy, that I was actually looking forward to the many changes and updates that this remake was going to have. Even walking out of the theatre, I was judging this very much as it's own movie. Having said that, I have to say that I don't completely dislike this movie, I just felt very let down, not just as a fan of The Stepford Wives, but as a normal filmgoer as well. There are a lot of good things offered in this remake. The cast is outstanding. I disagree with many who think Matthew Broderick was underused. I thought he was perfectly used, and I liked that they made his character more sympathetic. In a way, you have more respect for him than you do Joanna, unlike the original. And also unlike the original, Joanna is very sleezy, and overall a horrible human being with some redeemable qualities. Being a straight male, I almost feel weird saying this, but Bette Midler was perhaps the best thing about the movie. She put an interesting spin on the character of Bobbie. Most of the jokes are clever, and for the most part classy.But here is the major problem. Frank Oz made the horrible mistake of updating this movie and changing a lot of the story, just for the sake of changing it. I have a feeling that he wanted to do something different to make this his own movie, but never thought about it hard enough to make it different in a clever way. The climax plays out just like the original, and has the supermarket scene with the Stepford Wives, but then there's a whole "second ending" that not only seems like a sloppy and thoughtless twist, but it makes very little sense. This is the same mistake that Planet Of The Apes and Rollerball both made with their remakes. They tried to surprise the audience with a new shocking twist, but it's not thought out or well executed, and it's just plain dumb. Then my other big complaint is the pacing of the movie. There's far too much "filler" in the middle section. Scenes that draw out the inevitable un-necessarily. Then when it finally comes time for the real excitement in the climax, they rush through it. I was very pleased how Oz filmed and pieced together the climax. Even the way the confrontation at the mansion was changed up, I was impressed. But what was the sense of condensing the best part of the movie into a few rushed minutes when there were several scenes in the middle section that were tediously dull? Ultimately, it's the various new twists and cheap modern day updates that bury this movie. It's not at all that I objected to the changes as a fan of the original, it's because they don't fit the basic theme and tone of the rest of the movie. So many of these modern day changes (just for the sake of changing) feel wildly out of place.There is a lot of good material and great scenes, and for the most part the story is told well. I think when this comes out on video and DVD I'm going to put this on tape, minus some of the scenes from the middle, and minus the second ending. I'm hoping I'll enjoy it a lot more that way. One more thing. Why did they change the knife scene????? A hand on a stove element? Lame substitution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely not the kind of movie I am used to seeing. I have to admit that I did not have to pay to see this movie, being that I snuck into it after going to see Mean Girls, but at the same time I think it is fair that I give my two cents. Although I have not seen the "original" work, I would have to say that this film did not live up to its full potential. And here's why. It had what you would call an A-List cast, Nicole Kidman, Christopher Walken, and Ferris--I mean Matthew Broderick. And Jon Lovitz and a few other familiar faces. So the potential was there for a memorable film. The problem was, the theme of the movie shifted too much, and it seemed to me like the film could not decide what it wanted to be, a thriller, a comedy, a mystery, a sci-fi, or what. There was not enough emphasis on any one genre to define itself. There wasn't enough laughs to be a comedy. There wasn't enough science to be a sci-fi. It wasn't intense enough to be a thriller. There wasn't enough mystery to be, well... a mystery!! I guess maybe this wasn't my type of film, but it seems to me that if The Stepford Wives had excelled in any of these areas, it would have been a better film for it. Instead, it seems to have fallen dead in the middle. It did have its moments, though, several laughs that nearly had me out of my seat... But with a remake, you expect a little more!! Jeez, aren't today's audiences demanding?! Yes we are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After all the bad pre-release press, Stepford is a pleasant surprise. Not great, but enjoyable. Quite a few big laughs. My main complaint was the movie was too short and the plot moved too quickly. Would've liked to see what was left on the cutting room floor. The original took its time and built up suspense, but there wasn't much here. (realize this was a comedy, but even so) Even though they changed the ending, it worked for this version. Kidman was good, wish the supporting cast had more to do (particularly Midler) The Roger Bart character, while providing some laughs, didn't really work and was obviously thrown in for topical value. Broderick didn't have much to do but give soulful looks. Glenn Close made the most of her role. Midler got most of the laughs but wasn't around enough. Overall a nice summer comedy. The original had more of an edge and a point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. I will just make a few comments.I would be interested in seeing the director's cut of the movie because it's obvious that a lot of stuff was cut. That being said it was an entertaining, slight dark comedy with good performances.Nicole Kidman does a good job as the lead Joanna Eberhard, although her American accent is a little off at times (She was born in American but grew up in Australia). I get the feeling that much of John Lovitz's part was left on the cutting room floor. I would have liked to see more of him. Matthew Broderick, Bette Midler, and Roger Bart all are good in their parts, especially the latter tow, but it's Glenn Close that steals the show. She is simply marvelous and utterly convincing in her role. The only true disappointment of the movie was Christopher Walken. He phoned in his performance and come off very mechanical. But if this was his intent then it's a brilliant move.I'm off to rent the original and then read the book. We'll see if my view on this move changes any way.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A deliciously campy mixture of satire and sci-fi.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stepford Wives is a very Burton esque remake of the 1970s film/novel that i must say was quite impressive. Though the satire on suburban life and gender roles is trite at times, it still manages to fit well into the scheme of things. The trailers, with the exception of the first one, did not do the movie justice at all, dissuading many of my friends from watching it, but i managed to set them back on the right track. Though the ending was a little predictable it still fits in with the overall theme of things. The humor was good, and the plot was suitable, and the casting was done very well, especially Glenn Close's character and Bette Midler's character, and Nicole Kidman playing a former CEO and uptight bitch is very fitting.Now, some people might argue that Nicole and Matt didn't have much chemistry, but that's how it was supposed to be. They play a couple struggling to stay together, last time i checked struggling couples did not have much chemistry to begin with, trust me, i know from experience. Probably the only thing i would change would be the ending. There is a scene towards the end of Nicole turning the corner as a stepford wife in a supermarket, and that, in my opinion would've been the perfect ending, very Kubrick-esque, but then again, that's just me. Though predictable, the ending did fit in nonetheless. Overall? i enjoyed the movie very much, I'd say i give it a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a witty, sassy refreshingly fun remake of one of the best thrillers ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a major fan of the original Stepford wives and Ira Levin's book. I rank the original among my favorite movies ever and have been waiting for this movie for at least a year. And I saw it opening night. And loved it.This seems to be a love it or hate it type of movie and I can see why in a way. My thoughts on the movie-SPOILERS!If anyone comes in expecting to see an exact replica(LOL) of the original they will be possibly let down, the basic concept and characters, names are the same but this is Stepford in today's modern society. And it is not a horror it is a dark comedy. More comedy then dark. Funny-almost TO funny-wickedly camp-a few times a bit creepy-and features an amazing cast. But know what your watching before your watching it,this isn't an exact remake although there will be certain familiar elements.But this is not stepford wives as we knew it all those years ago-oh the lovely ladies of stepford are still there as mechanical as ever, as they do their exercise steps so flawlessly, by pretending to be washing machines. But this movie has been done as a comedy which I went in prepared for as I had heard about the movie and been on the IMDB stepford wives board so I knew(a little) what I was getting into. I imagine however for those that want to see the whole first movie done again they will be disapointed-or maybe not-if one can say- (hey, it's a comedy-stepford wives(the original) spoofs the husbands that want these perfect women and now the modern day stepford wives spoofs the whole original stepford wives) then maybe one can have a good time with this. And what a time it will be! I haven't laughed that hard at a movie theater in a LONG time-and I see many, many movies-at several points I thought I was gonna have to leave the theater. In fact, judging from the reaction of pretty much the majority of people in there, including my friends, many felt the same. The whole theater was laughing so hard it was impossible to get and hear everything and when the movie was over everyone broke into claps. I haven't seen THAT in awhile-not even at Shrek2 which I saw the week before. Or maybe it's just that that we are from Connecticut....(Great home state tribute by the way!)We broke into clapping at that to....The cast was fantastic. Nicole Kidman shows she can pretty much do any type of movie and do it well-Glen Close and Christopher Walken were great-Mathew Broderick brought a certain something to Walter Eberhart-a much nicer guy then in the original-Faith Hill-to underused-her part should have been bigger but she was still good and at leat she got to spark! Colorful role though her screen time was much to limited. And how about the new plot line of a gay couple-Quite good, I enjoyed the whole cast.But the best role in the film, without question, had to belong to Bette Midler. She absolutely made the movie, she had the best lines(pine cones anyone?), best scenes, and even though the movie was completely different from the original she still made Bobbie recognizable-a perfect casting fit.My ONLY complaint(alas-heard quite frequently already) is the ending-the last five minutes I could have lived without. The final "twist" involving sparking mens' heads, Glen close suddenly morphing into Alex from Fatal Attraction , and a twist that puts the whole previous premise of the "robots" into complete senselessness, was not in keeping with the rest of the movie and quite frankly it was bewildering why that was even thrown in, in the first place.The movie was strong enough. It didn't need it and detracted from it. (Hey, there's camp and there's complete absurdity.)This movie however, for all it's controversy, mixed reviews and strange baffling final minutes, is hysterical. And that's quite a compliment. It is very difficult to 1) MAKE a funny movie at all whether it's a remake or completely original and: 2) remake any film especially one that really became a household name like stepford wives. That the movie pulls it off says alot about the talent and creativity that went into making it. Being from the "home of the city of stepford", Connecticut, alot of the fun as well, was seeing my beautiful state(we don't get THAT many movies filmed here) and seeing an accomplished group of talented, well respected actors/actresses camp it up in a fine homage to one of my favorite movies of all time. Even if you've never seen the original(as had not the people in front of us) please-see it for the entertainment factor. You'll laugh so hard you might spit out the movie popcorn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having never seen the original, as many recommended, I have nothing to compare this movie to. First of all, when I first saw trailers for this at other movies, all it showed was Nicole Kidman stroking a black Mercedes. Anyways. Second of all, the movie itself was good, the cast was obviously having a great time acting out their roles, especially Glenn Close. The director/editor dropped clues along the way hinting that these women were robot doubles so I figured the women were elsewhere, either dead, sedated or just trapped at the Men's Association house. Several hints were dropped including: Faith Hill's amazing twirls while square dancing, Bette Midler's hand burning on the stove, Faith Hill on the stairs going forwards and reverse when Kidman and Midler are playing with her "remote", the ATM dispensing blonde, and Kidman's robot double lying naked on the table. Then, at the end when Broderick starts "erasing" their microchips in the basement, they are magically deprogrammed and appear to remember everything, that does not sound too robotic. Yet, Walken, in the "commerical" for your own Stepford Wife, explains how the women are implanted with microchips, yet they are basically the same person, just fine tuned. But in the end, I was wondering, well are they women with microchips or robots?? It was never explained!!! But, overall it was funny with an underlying "men-suck" overture. 5 Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to Stepford, population: Camp, POTENTIAL SPOILERS HEREIN!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING! POSSIBLE SPOILERS HEREIN!In 1975, Ira Levin's book "The Stepford Wives" was made into a film. The movie, like the book, was a horror/science-fiction treatise on the women's movement about an idyllic little town where the men turned their feminist wives into subservient June Cleaver clones. In retrospect, the movie was both chilling in its premise and amazingly campy in its execution, like much of Levin's work ("Rosemary's Baby", "Sliver"). The new adaptation of Levin's book (since it's not exactly a remake of the 1975 film) decides to jettison the horror aspect and go straight for the camp factor. In this it succeeds, but the film is wildly uneven at times and often feels as if it has itself been a victim of the Stepford machinery.Joanna Eberhart (Nicole Kidman) is the powerful and respected head of the EBS television network. When a disgruntled contestant on one of her reality shows goes on a shooting spree, Joanna is fired to avoid damaging lawsuits. Her husband Walter (Matthew Broderick) decides that the family needs a new start and moves to the small gated community of Stepford, Connecticut. Soon Joanna finds that all of the women in Stepford are smiling, well-groomed, and live only to serve their husbands, who spend all of THEIR time at the Stepford Men's Association. The Stepford women even wear their best dresses to aerobics class, where all their exercises mimic household chores, and to the book club, where they discuss books on decorating. The only others who find the situation bizarre are Bobbie Markowitz (Bette Midler) and Roger Bannister (Roger Bart), and soon the three are trying to get to the bottom of Stepford's secrets.As might be expected, the best performances of the film come from the Stepford wives themselves. Kidman is always a pleasure to watch on screen, and Midler has some of the best one-liners in the film even though she's playing a character she's played a dozen times over. Bart steals nearly every scene he's in as the only Stepford wife who's a gay man (and quite the little flamer to boot). Glenn Close is hilarious as Claire Wellington, the town's matron, and Faith Hill has some very amusing moments in her brief screen time. The men, however, don't come off nearly as well. Broderick is woefully miscast, and he never seems to bring any spark to his milquetoast of a husband. Christopher Walken, as the leader of the Men's Association, doesn't even appear to be trying, and his appearance in a supposed-to-be-retro-campy commercial for Stepford is painful.Director Frank Oz and screenwriter Paul Rudnick have both done fine work in their careers, and they make a valiant effort to film a dark satirical comedy, but they're just not quite up to the task. Oz's direction is quite static, and there are times in the film when it's clear that the cast wasn't being cooperative (rumors of on-set fighting ran rampant during production). Rudnick is a master of campy, zingy one-liners, and while the movie is filled with several genuinely funny moments and lines, there is little connecting them. It's as if he was so concerned with filling the script with jokes that he forgot a plot or character development. Characters come and go too quickly for us to become invested in them, and Kidman and Broderick have no chemistry to speak of. There are also several inconsistencies with how the wives are presented, which are never resolved or explained, although the movie's brisk pace and re-shot ending suggest that such details may have existed at one time. Additionally, the film tends to alternate between campy farce and techno-thriller, as if Oz and Rudnick were never sure of which end to play.Despite all these drawbacks, the film is still watchable and entertaining with more than one moment of drop-dead humor. Enough moments, in fact, that it almost makes up for the disappointingly predictable ending. In addition, the opening credit sequence is brilliant, a montage of near-fetishistic scenes of 1950's housewives dancing in absurdly futuristic kitchens. Worth a trip to the theatre or video store, for sure, but make sure you've got a high tolerance for camp. 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a fan of the original movie. When I first heard that there was going to be a re-make, I thought it was a bloody stupid idea. After reading a NY Times article about how troubled this project was, I came into the screen preview with very low expectations. Well I was surprised that I enjoyed practically everything about the movie. Excellent cast. A refreshing (these days) 90 minute running time. Lots, and I mean LOTS, of broad laughs beginning straight away with the clever tongue-in-cheek opening credits. Excellent production values.The only thing I didn't like was a messy climax that wasn't consistent with the rest of the movie, both in tone and logic. I understand that in today's post-modern world, the studio had to tweak the ending but it felt like they pulled the ending out of their ass because they were stuck on what to do. .. which is probably the case.So there you have it: an enjoyable, funny, mostly mindless 90 minutes. Certainly no Disaster as rumors would lead you to believe.</fullReview>

Nonetheless it shouldn't affect your going out to see this sci-fi-comedy feature.Beautifully scored and filmed. Dazzling costume and colors added to make this feature quite entertaining. I felt that Walter Kresby (Matthew Broderick) in a heart to heart scene with his wife Joanna Eberhart (Nicole Kidman) seemed slightly taken back with Kidman's super stardom talent that close up. And I think it was a pretty good idea that they did that scene sitting down!A clever story I enjoyed to the end with a surprising twist.A stellar performance by Christopher Walken and Glenn Close.Bette Midler, and Jon Lovitz (the Markowitzes) add the comic relief to an otherwise scary plot.

		<fullReview>The new Stepford Wives is played more to the comedy angle, and, as such, is more "fun" and "funny" than dark or suspenseful. The cast is great, but, as with most movies with an ensemble of good comedy actors, some are not given enough screen time to really shine in their own right, although they each get to add their particular brand of comedic sparkle to the retelling of the Stepford story. This is a clever "re-imagining" of the story, which pays a proper homage to the original. If you saw the original, you will "get" some of the jokes aimed back at the original. If you didn't see the original, no matter, there are enough new laughs to keep you amused throughout, and you won't know what you are missing. The new Stepford Wives is 2 hours of good fun, enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not All That Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK there might be like zillion of negative review of this movie all over IMDb, but to me I think it is a pretty satisfying time pass movie.OK I won't deny it that the director has one of the worst lines of movie under his belt, and that enough to guarantee what this movie would be like but give it a shot and watch it on the Saturday afternoon or so and let the time fly by not thinking anything. That is what I did.Some how despite having a made a pretty poor movie Frank Oz always get the Hollywood stars to be in his movie, and this time he get Nicole Kidman and Matthew Broderick and so on. The cast alone is the selling point of the movie. Plus Nicole in this movie looks gorgeous. I think the story is pretty consistence once we pass the first 10 minute of the movie which is there to kill time and making the movie really cheap. Anyway the movie is quite fun to watch through out though the story is very predictable. There is noting that you not already known, so no surprise here. The action is alright and the direction is OK.Overall: It Is A Pretty Alright Movie, Not All That Bad. Rating: 5/10(Grade: C-) Thanks For Reading !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting ideas... but a futile attempt to make it a comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reasons for seeing this film:1. Good cast. Kidman is great in her new look and her performance is also decent. Matt Broderick sometimes falters, especially in the last part but overall good. Bette Midler, Glenn Close and Christopher Walken are also there. Faith Hill isn't used much.2. The idea behind this film. I haven't read Ira Levin's novel. So the idea quite fascinated me. And the presentation in the film deliberately using stereotypes in every character is something that fits.Reason not to see the film:1. The futile and irritating attempt to make this film a comedy. I gather that Levin's novel has no comic elements. It would be better if they restrict the story to plain thriller. the necessary dark humor is the plot itself. One doesn't need to overdo it.So, I'd definitely try to see the original 1975 film. This film has a star-studded cast, but as a film it's hardly above average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the original when it came out and couldn't stand it. This was when it was the in thing to be a house husband and dick-less. It was the east coast N.O.W. culture in the movies. Supposedly it was a horror movie with the obviously politically correct nod toward woman's lib. There was no horror it was just long and boring. This one is much better and probably too short. Their's some good dialogue and humor that makes the settings less picture perfect. The settings are pleasing to the eye much as the housewives but the husbands are software executives and would like their woman more compatible, like their computers. So they decide to combine the two. I think Matthew Broderick is a good choice to play Nicole Kidman's husband. He's very likable and not as pushy until the other husbands work him over. Kidman plays a successful television executive who loses her job after a reality show she made backfires. This is an entertaining comedy and doesn't try to be anything more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colorful and comical remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Oz's remake of the classic 1975 thriller may be critically bashed by some, but is actually a very entertaining re-envisioning.Fired business woman moves to a small Conneticut village with her family, where she learns that the local housewives are acting very strangely.The Stepford Wives 2004 is one of the most cleverly done remakes around. Rather than try to capture the expectations of the original film, this remake looks at the already-familiar story in a whole new light as a dark comedy. Even more effective is the fact that this is a truly funny and well-written dark comedy! The direction is lavishly good, the film has some wonderful sets, a great music score, and a very stylish credit sequence.The great cast is yet another highlight. Lovely Nicole Kidman does an excellent performance as usual. While supporting cast Broderick, Midler, Close, Walken, and Bart make for some nicely colorful characters.Just why so many people dislike this film I don't know, but it's a remake that is worth being viewed before being judged. Some have come to like this version better than the original film.*** 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>--That line right there is one of several hilarious lines in this hilarious comedy! Joanna Eberhart is a TV Network producer and just got fired by the boss. The family decides to move out into Stepford. She meets friends with new Bobbie Markowitz, a Jewish writer who's also a recovering alcoholic and flamboyant fairy friend Roger. They all soon realize that something isn't right in Stepford. Why are the women of Stepford so perfect? They'll have to solve the mystery before it's to late and they'll turn into one of them!This is a hilarious comedy thriller that'll make you laugh the whole way! Lines are memorable in this film and there are some sweet moments. The original film was a horror and Frank Oz took his risk to make this remake a comedy. Well, it looked like it worked. The acting for Kidman, Broderick, Midler, Bart's performances are hilarious! They'll put a big smile to your faces when you watch this film.There is a plot hole in this movie I can't get out of my mind. It's how they make the Stepford wives. Are they robots or implants transplanted in their heads? Well, we can let it out of the way.This film is hilarious and anyone could see it. It's not a chick flick. This is not as bad as many people had said so trust my review. It's really funny!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the comments I heard and read about this film were that it was absolutely awful - specially compared to the first version with Katherine Ross. In fact I watched it, because it was the only thing on the box and was most agreeably surprised. Of course, could be because I found the first film quite boring with all the preaching - also I think K. Ross is a very bad actress (awfully Sixties). Although the book was great, like all Ira Levin's work.This was just a "light-hearted romp", sending up every cliché in the book - the TV executive, the big houses in the country, the happy families of what looked like very over-weight children, the rampant consumerism. To a European, this is in fact what Connecticut looks like (only in parts of course!). Having just come back to a visit to Sharon Connecticut, I could empathize with the inhabitants of Stepford.Great cast - Glenn Close as usual looking more intelligent than anyone for miles around, Nicole Kidman showing a wonderful sense of fun (specially as the last time I saw her she was drooping around the place as Virginia Woolfe).The transformation was particularly good - much less ghoulish than in the first version - in keeping with the generally light tone. Thre final words summed it all up so well: "No talking, keep shopping".</fullReview>

Do not waste your time or money seeing this film, it has no redeeming features it doesn't even work as "so bad its good". I watched this in a fairly full cinema. Apart from people getting up to leave it was almost silent. I stuck it out, after all as I said its a good basic idea, its got fairly good actors, it had to get better. It didn't. I found yourself siding with the Stepford husbands, but only because if one side could achieve total victory this awful awful film would end and I could go home.Just to reiterate, this is the worst film I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why is this film getting so much negativity? For instance, most critics complain about the fact that this isn't as dark or as good as the original. Since when was it trying to be like the original? This film is decidedly comedic (with dashes of sci-fi thrown in) and it's all the better for it. Nicole Kidman shines as the bewildered Joanna as does Bette Midler as the hilarious Bobbie. However, the sci-fi parts of the film do not mix very well with the film's main theme. It could have worked but this movie is far too silly to really be a black comedy. Christopher Walken is surprisingly dull as Bill whilst the Stepford Husbands come off looking sad and pathetic (whether this is how they were supposed to be portrayed i don't know). Despite these flaws, The Stepford Wives is a (almost)full fledged laugh-riot that you won't regret giving 90 minutes of your time to. Highlights include Viggo and the Book Club.</fullReview>

Anyway, i think Nicole Kidman (SHE'S SOOOOOO PRETTY and slim in the movie)as well as Glenn Close did a great job. Matthew Broderick played fair, his character was not believable at first, but he turned out to be okay in the end. Moreover,I think this movie not only entertains but also provide life's lessons: one is that life indeed is not perfect, inevitable things really happen to us because God wants us to learn the hard way and become stronger the next time, and second, you have to love not BECAUSE OF but INSPITE OF.The only flaw for me is that the movie itself is quite fast paced.

I know there are 200+ comments out there describing the robot versus mind control script disaster, but I have thought of a sad, but feasible way to clear up the mess and include all those lovely (and expensive) CG scenes of Bette et al. OK, so at the beginning of the film (before it got bad), Kidman (as the TV Exec) gets shot by her reality show contestant, Hank (Mike White). The shot misses and she gets canned, has a breakdown, goes to Stepford etc....Well what if either the shot does not miss and all of the "Stepford" experience is all in her mind as he lies injured or the "Stepford" experience is all in her mind as is the looney bin having her breakdown......I know not perfect, but I am sure it would have had less of us complaining about the terrible plot (and I am being kind here).</fullReview>

What it turned out to be was a delightful comedic twist on a dismal depressing movie that came out in the seventies. Granted I did like the original with Katherine Ross but I thought it was too dark and this remake made me laugh without overdoing the stereotypes of a woman's role in modern day society.Secondly were the stellar performances by Nicole Kidman,Matthew Broderick (who never disappoints comedically),Bette Midler (who also never disappoints comedically),and Roger Bannister. They really brought life to this movie. Now the disclaimer.

		<fullReview>The opening credits remind you of a 1950s TV commercial for Aerowax and Amana refrigerators. In the opening scene Nicole Kidman perfectly portrays the totally phony baloney, plastic banana, good time rock 'n roller that television executives really are. Proving that comedy must have an element of truth to be funny, the new network shows she previews for the network affiliates are probably only a season or two away from being on the air. After that, it's slow for a bit but starts to pick up when Bette Midler appears. As in every movie she's in, Bette steals the show. Matthew Broderick plays his usual genre--baby faced Mr. Nice Guy. He keeps playing that same role so often one wonders if he really can act. Glenn Close is superb--a cross between Donna Reed and June Cleaver, squared and taken to the Pth degree. When the plot takes a twist at the end she plays it magnificently. If you rent the DVD version be sure to watch the outtake scene in Bette Midler's kitchen. This is the funniest movies I have seen since "The First Wives Club". Why it is characterized as "Drama" or "Thriller" defies logic--it's a farce, pure and simple.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the comedy section at the store -- shoulda been the first hint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailer, at least to me, didn't hint at the remake of TSW as being one so radically different from the original film. In fact, I was rather excited about a new technologically advanced version of the movie, considering the robotic aspects of the plot. I should have known, yesterday, while searching for the DVD at my local video retail store and surprisingly finding it in the comedy section, not the horror, that I was in for a big disappointment. The first few minutes into the film I caught on quickly that something was wrong. Wrong in a sense that the remake was not going to provide the original atmosphere --the same creepiness generated in the first one. And wrong as far as dealing with believable characters. Off the bat, Joanna was ruined. One of the reasons the original worked so well and provided terror was because we got to establish/feel the humanity of the characters for a great deal of the film and then watch things go dreadful and machine-cold. I personally feel that a movie like TSW would only work if it was made with the fans of the original in mind. In this case, it's too modern for its own good. And not in the special-effects department, but more so in social and political representation. Do we really need a dash of SNL in our TSW? I don't think so. The comedy was counter-productive and made my experience with TSW (2004) lousy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget the Original: This is a comedy, guys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some critics disparage this film as a flimsy remake of the 1975 original but: Though the premise is the same, the Frank Oz movie is a comedy from start until the credits roll. I don't think of Nicole Kidman as a comedienne (nor is she much of an actress) but she handles this part very well. She exaggerates appropriately as the TV exec fired because of a "reality" project based on sex that threatens to ruin her network and subsequently as the post-nervous breakdown wife moved to Stepford to recover from the wreckage of life as a superstar. Moreover, while I doubt many people will agree with me, Kidman is far more attractive as a brunette than as a blonde. She reverts to her usual blonde self only at the end of the film when she's presented as a blonde robot. I wonder if she understood the irony. In short, Kidman is okay, though the comedy is supplied mostly by Matthew Broderick as her husband and by Bette Midler, Glenn Close, Christopher Walken (parodying his usual persona more or less) and Roger Bart and David Marshall Grant as a gay couple also newly arrived in Stepford. If seen without preconceptions based on the earlier movie, the new edition of Stepford Wives can be quite entertaining. I give it an 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch the original first, then enjoy this version...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just viewed the DVD of the 2004 version and absolutely loved it. I so disagree with most reviewers here. *SPOILERS AHEAD* The new version satirizes the original, is meant to be pure comedy with a little bit of drama and suspense thrown in. This new version is an "inside joke" that you will only find amusing if you've seen the first. Sure, we're supposed to consider men's roles vs. women's roles in our society, but that is simply a by-product from spoofing a movie where gender roles were the heavy-handed focal point. If you haven't seen the Kidman WIVES yet, do yourself a favor and watch the Ross WIVES first. For example, would The Brady Bunch Movie have been as enjoyable if one had never seen an episode of the TV series? I personally don't think so. Think of this new version as a SATIRE of the FIRST, NOT a REMAKE. Then you can enjoy, as I did, the fact that the husbands are such nerds, the wives were such powerhouses before their transformations, the happy ending, the over-the-top performances which are just hysterical. You can ignore the inconsistencies and holes. The whole movie is implausible after all, so 'so what' if the Wives are suddenly transformed back with a reversal of the messages to the chips in their brains, whereas Christopher Walken was irreversibly transformed? But it doesn't really matter. The journey is the fun part of this movie, not the destination. Another movie that this reminds me of is "Mars Attacks." Satire is meant to be fun, not taken seriously. CHILL OUT FOLKS - ENJOY THE MOVIE!</fullReview>

The one thing I would of liked to see, is a bit more seriousness, than comedy. I could see this going the way of a horror film, or just a drama. Also, the film could of been a bit longer, the average film length didn't seem long enough for this one. Maybe a 2 hour flick. But all in all, can't really complain.

A similar result occurred recently when I tried to view "Van Helsing," another "New Release" from Hollywood, which seems intent on keeping its audiences in the dark, which is an atmosphere much condusive to the picking of pockets....If you want your money's worth of highly enjoyable viewing, avoid this abortion and rent the original.Finally, I suggest that IMDb seriously consider offering the voters the option of "0."

		<fullReview>Five times during its neverending 1.5 hours I considered walking out of this movie; but I was with four other people in the theatre, so I decided against possibly insulting them or ruining the movie for them--just in case the film hadn't already insulted their taste or ruined itself for them. For someone who usually finds some redeeming qualities in every film experience, and who is interested in all genres and extremely open-minded, this vehement speech I give against The Stepford Wives is meant as a general warning to all people not to waste their 1.5 hours like myself--to spare their dignity and taste, and avoid their being haunted later by some of the vulgar, repulsive images and ideas put forth by the film. The modes of comedy, horror, thriller, drama, and science fiction alternate in unpredictable and unpleasant fits and starts throughout, with excruciating non-transitions linking them. The dialogue is as shoddy and trite as dialogue can be; the score sounds like tawdry elevator music and consistently tries to drown out the poor dialogue (unfortunately, without complete success); the tone with which the material is handled is disastrously ill-chosen--when striking a feminist note the film comes across as pathetic and sentimental; when striking a historically particular chauvinist note the film is dull and offensive in its baseball-bat-over-the-audience's-head polemic; when attempting to strike a tone of technological innovation and sci-fi imagination, the film flops for its utterly improbable, illogical, simplistic, inelegant presentation of devices, practices, and themes (the scene where Broderick shuts down all the computer clones comes readily to mind--are the women controlled by a central device, or are they clones, or are they the same women, slightly reprogrammed, with new bodies, or....? the film cannot decide and it's painfully obvious to any child who's lived this life in our world for six years at least that none of this is either possible, believable, or even pleasant to conceive). I dare not think that the two very intelligent main actors--Nicole Kidman and Matthew Broderick--could be anything less than deeply ashamed when they hear the name of this movie mentioned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll clear the air about the 1975 film: It was way too slow, even for 1970s standards... and their should at least have been a catfight between Joanna (Katherine Ross) and her 'robot-double' before one of them bit the dust via pantyhose strangulation. The remake is not much better, since the makers of this one tried way too hard to pick up the pace of the story (compared with 1975), and then ruined it with a totally unconvincing ending. Glenn Close should have known better, even if she is from Greenwich, Connecticut (where this remake was shot) and could have sung her way out of this mess instead of giving us such a slipshod wrap-up. The character that Bette Midler plays is old enough to be the kids' grandmother, but I guess that's the general rule in Hollywood: Try to hang on to the thirty-something mother roles as long as possible... or play a really young-looking grandmother who happens to be in her 50s.Christopher Walken is almost entirely wasted in 'Stepford' when you realize the fact that the actor probably only agreed to appear in the picture because he needed to pay his bills.And yet, who can't resist watching Nicole Kidman take it out on Matthew Broderick (a proxy for Kidman's ex-husband, Tom Cruise) without snickering, or watch her Joanna character shop at Stepford's 'Vons Pavilions' looking like floral-Barbie.I only wish I'd stayed in college to be able to afford buying one of those sumptuous Stepford mansions. Forget 'Trading Spaces' and all those other televised, makeover home shows; they've got nothing on the homes shown on "The Stepford Wives!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't fall for the cellophane package</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicole Kidman, a successful, ball-breaking TV exec, is fired from her job after a disgruntled reality show contestant goes berserk. Her husband, hoping to rebuild their marriage, moves the family to the luxury Stepford estate in Connecticut. All the other wives on the estate (with the exceptions of Bette Midler and Glen Close's characters) are sugary-sweet blonde bimbo stereotypes running to do their husbands' slightest bidding. Yet all is not as it seems.The new version of Stepford Wives is glossy, antiseptic, and well-acted. Whilst possible to engage intellectually with it, there is no pretence of unfolding a story with gradual suspense ? rather it is a tribute to the original concept with a few added layers.(Spoilers follow)It transpires that the wives at Stepford have been ?improved' by means of nano-chips inserted in the brain, turning them into virtual robots (in the earlier film adaptation, they were given drugs). All of them were formerly high-powered successful women. Now they are more interested in kitchen recipes than intllectually challenging subjects. The men have remote control devices to fine tune the behaviour of their wives. The original idea was maybe that women should revolt against the wife-cook-and-bottle-washer image, the dye-blonde that was always docile, less successful than her husband, less intelligent, lived only to make him happy (a sort of ?50s stereotype). But the new version not only asks if women should really accept such a dumbed down role, it asks if men should be dumb enough to want it. It also turns the idea on its gender-specific head when we discover that Glen Close is not a Stepford Wife at all, but the evil mastermind behind the whole village, an ex- genetic engineer. She made the original ?Stepford Husband' (Christopher Walken) as a man that other men would look up to and listen to ? and, of course, give large amounts of money to. This raises the spectre of women who seek ?Stepford Husbands' ? ie traditionally subordinated males whose primary purpose is hunter-gatherer-provider.What the original is really saying is that to seek a standardised person in any sense or form is shortsighted and results in disaster (the gender issues raised by the original concept are merely some of the manifestations.) It's a form of onanism, treating people not as ends in themselves but as means to an end (usually our end). The starting scene (of TV reality-shows that fail when they are too successful), also lays the foundation for us to equate any seeming ?perfection' with ?Stepfordness'. As Kidman's character remarks later on, perfection isn't natural, the perfect marriage involves much more. The film is released by Paramount Pictures, and some people have observed that many executives and filmmakers there seem to have been replaced by Stepford replicants: perhaps it is to be expected when we get an audience-pandering finale. The (deliberate?) lack of emotional engagement possibly means that the people who really enjoy what the film has to say don't need a saccharine-coated ending, whereas the ones who need to be reassured by such devices as formulaic denouements will hardly feel satisfied as they have been given a ?Stepford treatment' film - such self-parody will probably have been lost on pure entertainment seekers.Perhaps the next re-make will substitute religion for drugs or nano-chips? The men will defend some repressive religion such as modern day Islam or Christianity ("Hey, Islam isn't that bad, lots of women LIKE being treated that way.") The sexual stereotypes, women who are just there to please their husbands, are particularly prevalent in religion . . .· Eph. 5:22-25 "Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing. Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it" · Col. 3:18-19 "Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them."· 1 Pet. 3:1 "Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;" · 1 Pet. 3:7-8 "Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered."This type of brainwashing has resulted in a male-orientated definition of sex where sex = penetration (as the Hite Report pointed out, penetration is simply the most convenient way for men, not women, to achieve orgasm). Sex is then used as a controlling factor for men to either physically dominate their wives/partners into being Stepford Wives or for women to manipulate their men into being Stepford Husbands. The lack of recognition for a woman's basic physiology eventually produces a backlashStepford Wives has been passed over as an idea addressing yesterday's problems. But, as feminist philosopher Janet Radcliffe pointed out, when feminism achieves its apparent aims by means of a backlash against men (as exemplified in the early part of this film, women rising to dominance) then that creates the same seeds in men to fight back and put women back into a subordinate position. Often when this has happened, women have achieved their ends by a sort of masculinisation, emulating male characteristics in order to ?beat them at their own game'. The more permanent solution is for women to excel not by imitating men but by strengthening their own feminine characteristics. One of the attractions of the current movie for an actor of the calibre of Nicole Kidman must surely be the opportunity for exploring the many different ways a woman can develop her strength in a single character. She goes from (masculinised) TV Exec, to (imitation ? as she only pretends to undergo the procedure) blonde bimbo Stepford wife, to woman of strong and balanced emotional sensitivity. In the final incarnation as it were, she rescues her husband from himself, reminding him how love is an emotion he cannot experience fully with a robot, and then appears on television again as a more balanced individual than before, eschewing the modern obsession with perfection and promoting tolerance and communication as a road to success.See Stepford Wives and use it as a stepping stone to question, discuss and examine how far the attitudes iconised in the film are still prevalent, not just in the most obvious sense but in the many layers of society where one person manipulates another, or is treats someone as little more than a means to an end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>something interesting to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All I ever have read about this movie are bad reviews but after viewing it today I completely disagree with those reviews. This movie tells the story about the stereotypes that both men and women fall under and whether or not we can or really want to escape from them. Nicole Kidman does a fantastic job as Joanna Eberhart, a high strung business woman who gets fired from her job and suffers from a nervous breakdown. Matthew Broderick plays Walter Kresby, her supportive yet worn out husband who yearns to get away from the big smoke. Along with their two kids they move to Stepford, a perfect town that becomes a bit too creepy from the first moment they move in. Bette Midler and Roger Bart are hilarious as Bobbie Markovitz &amp; Roger Bannister. If I ever moved into a creepy town like that, they would be the two characters I would love to have as friends.This movie is fun to watch and I give it a 7/10!(Although I think Nicole Kidman could do with a bit more food!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>(Spoiler warning) Yes there is a message in it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I warn anyone who is yet to see it that this review will spoil it for you.Hey, does anybody know what year this latest version is set in? It seems, from the opening scenes, that it is a future time. Women have finally enfeebled men, crushed them. They have all the top jobs. They have all the high public profiles. And they are philanderers, whilst their men are faithful. There is open and shameless acceptance of the humiliation of men. And so, the only men we see in this film are two stereotypes ? the insipid, servile nerd who parts his hair and never questions his wife, and the male centerfold, chiseled and musclebound, eager to delight and satiate the palate of any woman, however repulsive.I wonder if men are still allowed to vote at this stage. Hmmmm?Well, the men of Stepford have done the male equivalent of burning their brassieres. But men will rebel differently to women, because of their inherent differences. While the feminist movement began with a desire for education, emancipation and equal career prospects, the 'masculist' movement appears to have begun with regaining touch - with their masculinity, with their boyishness and with their selfishness. Such is the extent of evolution at this stage, or corruption at this stage, that the men are just jokes. They cannot see past their own long-compromised egos. So, when Glenn Close creates her cyber-monster male chauvinist robot husband, he quickly finds a cache of disciples among these men. And so short is the vision of these 'men', that they happily seek to convert their wives into air-headed pot-scrubbing sex kittens.There is a question, asked by Joanna Eberhart just before she descends into the pit to be 'Stepford-ised'. She asks her husband if his new robotic woman can say she loves him. Glenn Close's cyber-monster interjects: 'in 37 languages'. What else would you expect from him? But then, the real question: 'Will she MEAN it?'Well, what will we have if we reach the stage where men are virtually helpless? Can a male truly love a woman to whom he is completely subservient, not by choice, but because of how society has finally structured itself? We can walk away from seeing this film with some enrichment, even if it's not direct. There is a message to both the sexes in it.Nicole Kidman excels, as the caricature of the ultimate 'female chauvinist pig' at the beginning, as the growing character in Stepford who questions and refines her role in the family, and finally as the voice of reason. Correctly, I started by hating her character. And by the end, I adored her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary - for all the wrong reasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original version of The Stepford Wives may have been no masterpiece, but it was Citizen Kane compared with this drek!Unsure of whether to play it safe or go out on a limb, to play up the anachronisms of a badly outdated concept or bring it into line with the 21st century, director Frank Oz has fumbled around incoherently. And he actually manages to include something to offend everyone - not in a Michael Moore, politically pointed way, but in a monstrously inept display of sheer excess.The film is ugly, pointless, humourless and in the final washup, completely worthless. There is something seriously wrong with your movie when Bette Midler is your most restrained cast member. Indeed, Nicole Kidman offers what may very well be the most appalling performance she has ever offered in a (to say the least) bumpy career. She makes no attempt at all to find a recognisably human foundation for her character, playing it instead as a broad caricature. And since the film's thesis is that the loss of humanity for a 'perfect society' the film virtually crumples into dust amidst Kidman's embarrassing mugging. I know there are people out there who maintain she is some sort of goddess, but sorry guys, you are worshipping the wrong diva.Bette Midler provides a few smiles along the way, but she is way below par. At least she seems to know how wretched the material is, which is more than we can say for Glenn Close. She actually makes Kidman look subdued.The film's finale is muddled and unclear. Are the Stepford Wives robots or women with computer chips in their brains? Do men in America really desire overdressed zombies for wives? Do men even think about repressing women any more? Undoubtedly some do, but the notion that an entire community would launch itself into this bizarre scheme is ridiculous, even by this film's modest standards.There must be some virtue in this film. How about a triumph of style over content. Alas no. The film rambles along in sub-par Tim Burton style. How about making a few bucks at the box office? Alas yes, though at least the public has belatedly seen the light.Awful film making. I don't mind if I never see anybody connected with it ever again - Midler excepted.</fullReview>

Everybody can laugh about this satire, which make it everything but dangerous.Everybody is over-playing here and they do it on purpose except for Bette Midler. Nicole Kidman sparkles again, but one could expect a little more ambition from someone with her ability. Glenn Close is, on purpose, making a complete robot and that's what this satire is about in more than one way.

		<shortDescription>Strong and capable performances save this film from being a wreck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie should have been a disaster. The character development was weak, the script was uninspiring, the jokes were clichéd and the whole sequence of events throughout the whole movie was exceedingly predictable. Even though I haven't read the novel, I'm quite sure that this movie was quite a weak and flawed adaptation of the story contained within the book. You can actually see from watching the movie that the original novel must have had a significant and intriguing depth and dimension that fails to be conveyed in the movie. And I'm quite sure the book had a much more intellectual focus than this movie did. If not for the excellent performances of the main players in the cast, I'm quite sure this movie would have been a flopBut it isn't. And the fact that it isn't can be attributed entirely to the excellent acting provided by Nicole Kidman, Glenn Close, Matthew Broderick and to some extent Bette Midler. They manage to give this movie some life, vitality and enthusiasm that is sadly missing from the whole script and plot of this movie.Nicole Kidman is outstanding in her portrayal of Joanne Eberhard. She portrays the various dimensions of her character's personality with a radiance and a realistic quality that gives a depth that effectively brings her character to life even with the flaws and defects of her script. Glenn Close also gives a flawless and wonderful performance as Clare Wellington and perfects every aspect and dimension of her character through her facial expressions, her manner of speaking and her strong on-screen persona. Matthew Broderick also performs strongly in his role even though the aspects of his character and his adjustment to Stepford could have been explored much more extensively on the part of the scriptwriters. Midler also portrays her role excellently ?although she runs the risk of being typecast in the role of the characters that she has consistently played in various movies. And Roger Bart is absolutely priceless in his role as the `Stepford husband'This film does suffer from some major flaws but, despite this, it is still relatively pleasant and enjoyable to view. It will never be a classic but is nevertheless harmless fun</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie last night and thought it to be refreshingly quirky with light twists throughout. It is funny but not without a good storyline. I found it to be thought provoking in the way that we all try so hard to fit in and to always be a our best - and why? However it is good to know that I am not the only one doing this only to realize there is nothing wrong with you just the way you are. Laughter was hear throughout the cinema and the actors were so entertaining. So nice to see them all doing something different and moving away from their normal pigeon holed characters of the past. I totally recommend that you see this movie - not just for the wonderful talent of the cast but to have a laugh at yourself. The simplicity and perfection of the set in this movie was a cross between 'cat' in the hat and the 'Truman story' just fantastic, and lets be honest wouldn't we all just love to live there - it's brilliantly done. The costumes were wonderful and gave just the right amount of the sixties feel to enhance the original movie. Grab a coke and some popcorn and enjoy the fantasy of being a Stepford wife, grab the most comfortable chair in the cinema and squirm at the fact that you too thought of this plot yourself years ago - don't deny it! we have all thought that life would be better if we could just change to people we love or in fact ourselves in some way. Come away with the feel good thought that you can do just that for awhile through this movie. And then buy this movie so you can relive it time and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robotic Approach to Cute Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm generally wary of remakes, especially when studios can do nothing better with the original material than update it with current stars and a dumbed-down script. Remaking "The Stepford Wives" as a comedy was an inspired idea, but the resulting movie is not. The potential to turn Ira Levin's thriller into a black comedy is there, but in the hands of screenwriter Paul ("In &amp; Out") Rudnick and director Frank Oz, "The Stepford Wives" is light n' amusing--and muddled--fluff. Rudnick is quick with the one-liners, but seems unsure with the plot, which is filled with contradictions. For instance, are these women being turned into robots or do they just have a chip implanted in their brains? (The movie presents both explanations with no attempt to reconcile them.) And the tacked-on epilogue appears to be just that: tacked on.However, if you're willing to overlook flaws in its plotting and obviousness in its humor, there are two reasons to see "The Stepford Wives": Bette Midler and Glenn Close. Midler is Midler, but that's exactly what her fans want. And following such un-funny comic vehicles as "Isn't She Great" and "Drowning Mona," it was nice to enjoy her in a movie again. Close is perfect as Claire Wellington, the most domineering of Stepford's wives, simultaneously creepy and hilarious. An honorable mention goes to Roger Bart, who plays one half of Stepford's token gay couple as if channeling the spirit of the late Paul Lynde. Top-billed stars Matthew Broderick and Nicole Kidman have their moments, but they're easily upstaged by Midler and Close.By keeping your expectations low, there are enough laughs in this comic take "The Stepford Wives" to make it worth seeing, if only at matinee prices.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely not a man's movie in the end, but it boasts one of the more eccentric male fantasy presentations in recent times along with a good dose of humor, ripe cynical cuteness from both Nicole Kidman and Matthew Broderik (who does an excellent job). I enjoyed this movie along with its feel goodness about it. An uplifting, entertaining movie - this is a great girl movie along with a date movie (with the more intelligently inclined or at least open minded male of the species). Unlike the stilted and underperformed horror version of the original, this update is superior and plays with its material in a well paced fashion. The only confusion is over the true nature of the Stepford Wives, particularly with a few scenes that offer different possible scenarios and explanations. Eight out of Ten Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Comedy - Very Funny - Can't Wait for DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am shocked by so many people who seemed to dislike this film. I would compare it to Death Becomes Her ( Bruce Willis film). I have never seen the original, in fact many have told me not to see it. I went because of the cast and the trailers. I tend to like dark comedy's anyway - if your looking for a horror film this aint it - no blood, guts etc.. just a lot of laughs and a lot of fun. Bette Midler was hysterical as usual -- along with the gay guys anticts i just laughed all the way through. I was confused over Faith Hill becoming an automatic teller machine - that didn't seem to fit. Enjoyable storyline - don't take it to serious. Glen Close and Christopher Walken make a great pair ( as they did in Sarah Plain And Tall). It doesn't take rocket science to figure out the plot, but it's alot of fun watching the characters bounce from room to room. Id say its a perfect way to spend an afternoon , get away from reality, and just enjoy a decent comedy - unless you want to see something with no intelligence, in which case you can view Dodgeball or Scooby Doo 2. Before you judge this movie harshly why not try to remember the really bad films like Blair Witch Project or Eyes Wide Shut. Nicole Kidmans career has certainly improved since her divorce -- I give this movie 4 stars!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>politically-correct silliness over satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's certainly a premise that's relevant for today's audiences, maybe even more so than when the original "Stepford Wives" was released in 1975, but director Frank Oz and scripter Paul Rudnick transform Ira Levin's allegorical tale of male chauvanism into a hit-or-miss screwball comedy. The film lacks any of the mystery (one of the two key twists is revealed early on), suspense, or horror of the original (which, while a flawed film, at least had some convictions), though many of the scenes are lovingly reproduced (the concluding grocery store sequence, por ejemplo). Nicole Kidman fits well as the lead, a cold-hearted woman looking to jump-start her life, possessing the right blend of sex appeal and comic timing; Bette Midler steals the show as the only other non-conformed female in Stepford. But despite the faithfulness to the original film (transposed somewhat uncomfortably into the realm of comedy), the ending is a shameless cop-out of politically-correct silliness, defying the downbeat sense of total male domination over the female gender which gave the original an eerie resonance--the climax plays it far too safe, and ultimately ruins any modern-day prophecy this film would have been looking to convey (if at all).5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake is a brilliant refashioning of the classic battle of the sexes with more thought provoking, sensitive elements brought into play. This complicated and difficult fusion of comedy, horror, drama, and science fiction is brought to the screen with a seamless blend of great balance and finesse. The mix of comedy and dramatic elements are well served in this tossed up movie of great scenes, emotional portraits of humanity and deliberately bland female perfection. Nicole Kidman, Matthew Broderik, Christopher Walken, and Glenn Close are amazing in their performances. The scene of Matthew Broderik sitting in the dark watching his sleeping wife early in the movie was great for its lack of dialogue - the totality of emotion was found in the visual scene itself. The ending as well as wrought with feeling not from the dialogue but the acting and performances themselves - the visual display of human behavior. Just like Jaws this movie captures the important psychological elements of laughter, sadness, happiness, all the emotions that make up being human. This movie is a tribute and a long needed update and remake of the classic providing a nice bit of revenge to the original movie. Except for some confusion over the actual transformation of Stepford women, this movie will be controversially received for its over the top portrayal of all female morales raising questions among the lives of senior citizens and the pounding of both the male ego and the feminist agenda. Whether an amicable blend of male and female conflicts and resolutions are satisfactorily addressed in this movie only time will ultimately tell. Nine out of Ten Stars.</fullReview>

As a comedy, it WORKED! I could not stop laughing throughout the 90 minutes and all the jokes were really creative and original. THe cast seemed like they were having so much fun with the movie, and that fun definitely came out of the screen and affected the audience. I probably missed 25% of the funny lines because people were laughing so hard you can barely hear the dialogue. The pacing was good, without a slow moment, as well as the acting.

		<fullReview>This is a movie that seems to have no idea what it wants to be. Several ideas are tossed around, but then are either forgotten or dumped.The plot is simple. Joanna is a television executive who is attacked by a reality show contestant from a show she approved during her network's "up front" presentations. She is fired from her job, and her husband suggests the family move to the town of Stepford, CT so Joanna can take a break. However, something weird is going on with the women in town, when one seemingly breaks down during a square dance.Up until now the movie works, then it falls apart. The secret, that the woman aren't human, is revealed about midway through the movie. So then any suspense the movie has tried to build evaporates. One by one Joanna's friends change, becoming more domesticated, but we the viewers already know why. Then comes Joanna's turn. However, she and her husband only pretend to turn Joanna, and they simply wait for the right moment to turn the other women back. It turns out that the women just have computer chips implanted in their brains, which can be deactivated, rather than the women being actual robots. This does not explain how one woman was able to act as an ATM, or how Bette Midler's character was able to run her hands through fire without getting burned. In fact, it just ends the movie on a confusing, rather than a positive note.Avoid this one if you can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This flick is one of those movies where you wonder why you spent your precious time watching it.I never read the book and never saw the original movie, but the premise is interesting. But that is where it stopped. Kidman played a network executive, an arrogant feminist stereotype which lacked any dynamism but following boring formulas to lead us into the context of the plot in this flick. Midler plays this arrogant woman archetypal of the type of woman that perfectly resembles an angry old liberal woman. I can't shake that quote out of my head, where she uttered at the 4th of July party, which I will paraphrase: "We are celebrating Independence Day, where are all the African-Americans here?" -- a line as contrived as the whole film tended to be. (If you look, you will see one or two black women, making that quote stick out more.) Now whether it was a contrived political piece to boost of the Hollywood status quo or just mere entertainment, it fails on both accounts. Every character was typically annoying cookie-cutter character constructs that brought nothing to a storyline that could of had substance.Can someone please take this as well as all those inane teen movies and chuck them in the fire?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went to see The Stepford Wives I was surprised about how much I liked it. My mind may have been swayed a little because of Nicole Kidman. I thought she was the film, she made it. I do have to comment on the relationship between her a Matthew Broderick's character. I didn't really feel that their marriage was believable. They only kissed once in the whole movie so, in the end how are they so madly in love? Other than that I thought the movie was funny, smart, witty, and interesting. Nicole Kidman did steal the show and she still looked gorgeous even with short brown hair. If you want to go to the movies to have a good time or go with a date this would be the perfect movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Stepford Wives isn't what most people would expect, everyone expects to see a really bad movie when they walk in, but I loved it, all the laughs,its tilted more to the comedy type this time, and thats a great change! I went with one of my best friends and we were cracking up during the entire movie. It shows what some men would do for the perfect wife, but what some won't do. You can kinda expect how it ends, but I had a great time,but there were parts where I was a little confused. Go watch it for yourself, you won't regret it, its got a great cast of actors/actresses such as the beautiful Nicole Kidman(Joanna Eberhart), the very talented Matthew Broderick(Walter Kresby), the hilarious Bette Midler(Bobbie Markowitz), Glenn Close (Claire Wellington), Chris Walken(Mike Wellington), And for her big screen debut as Sarah Sunderson, Faith Hill. All in all I give it a 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what people are complaining about, but I liked this movie a lot. The acting is wonderful, the ending ironic and surprising. If you are considering seeing this movie, I recommend it, despite what other people have said. Even my fiancé liked it, and we usually don't agree on films, he being a fan of criminal, political movies, and I being a fan of films like Rushmore, Office Space, Princess Bride, on and on. I haven't seen the first Stepford Wives movie or read the book, but I really enjoyed this film and am looking forward to seeing it again on video. Even if you are unsure about whether you will like it, give it a chance. I read the criticism of the film before going to see it, but didn't let it deter me; I'm glad I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After all the stories I'd heard, I was a bit skeptical, but the preview audiences I watched it with ate it up. It was funny and light and looked attractive, and Nicole Kidman keeps showing that she owns the big screen. As for the ending, I liked it but was surprised and wonder whether they'll keep it. It's good to see the terrific Glenn Close on the big screen again as well, though I've never really liked Midler. Christopher Walken was appropriately chilling (he can do that so well), and the audience LOVED Nicole's gay friend. Faith Hill fans will be somewhat disappointed, however, that she does not have a very big part, but she looks great in what she does have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having read the comments on IMDb and the quite average votes this movie has got, I was sceptical and I didn't know whether I would like it or not. So I ignored Stepford Wives at the box office. Today, I saw it as a bargain at my local grocery store, bought it, went home, put it into my DVD-player and... I was surprised. I still am. The Stepford wives is really a movie worth watching and I must say, I really (!!!) like it. If you like comedies with heart, charm, a touch of romance and also some things to think about, then this is definitely one for you. All actors are at least doing good jobs, some are splendid and the story itself is really lovable. Yes, the plot has some tiny weaknesses, but nothing to really bother about. Watch it and judge by yourself. The story itself is witty, smartly designed and it will catch you in a way that you will lose your interest in looking for some minor flaws. I give this movie 8 out of ten and it really deserves this vote. Try it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually paid to see this movie. Fortunately, it was at a two-dollar theater. I had heard the stories of the alleged problems in the making of this thing, and after suffering through this misbegotten trash, I believe them all. The original STEPFORD WIVES is a classic horror film. The remake wants to be a satiric comedy, but it's not funny at all. There is nothing funny whatsoever in this project. It was genuinely embarrassing to watch; I hated the main characters, particularly Matthew Broderick, who was spectacularly miscast. I have seen some of the worst movies ever made, but this one deserves a special place in the annals of filmdom, as it is a complete failure in every way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like most here, I dismiss it as the trash it is. But one part had me scratching my head: At the party, Walter sneaks off to the basement. Because of the deer-caught-in-the-headlights look on his face and how he pushes the buttons, it's obvious he has no idea where he is or what he's doing. Yet, in spite of himself, he de-activates the microchips, and the women return to normal. We then learn Joanna has not joined the ranks of the Perpetually Perky because Walter decided against it!How could he have not gone through with it? Why did the men entrust him with the implantation? How could he have not known his way around or how the system operates? Why didn't his button-pushing set off an alarm? Why was the place unattended? I don't know which is worse: the sheer illogic of this "movie," that Rudnick is an A-List scribe, or that the cast agreed to waste their time on this!Just like Leonardo DiCaprio, no matter how old Broderick gets, he'll always look 18. Bette Midler was so over the top, I wondered why she wasn't the first to be "Stepfordized." Glenn Close was over the top in the opposite direction. Oddly, it took this to make me begin to appreciate Kidman. At first, she looks like Annette Bening channeling Evita Peron. But she works hard to to sell the story. She is simply better than the material deserves. And she's gorgeous. Tom Cruise, you're an idiot! There, I've said it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original movie so I have nothing to compare this movie to. I saw it for the first time on DVD. I enjoyed it and it held my attention the entire time. The script was clever and the parts were well cast. I don't understand all the criticism of this movie. Glenn Close is of course the stand-out here. Kidman, Midler and the rest of the cast also do a fine job. As I understand, the original movie is much darker. I don't think such a tone would have been appropriate here. There is dark comedy here and the message of the film is presented very effectively with this tone. Despite not seeing the original, I think this movie is nicely updated to the time and place we find ourselves living in today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>more serious than it looks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am really astonished by the bad reviews and grades that this film received from many of the IMDb viewers. The film uses the plot in Ira Levin's book and in the older film as a pretext for a more deep and critical view of life in America. I liked it, and I believe that it is one of the best satiric films of the year, more serious and deep than it seems, saying a lot about the rush for kitsch, the politics, the false morality, and the standardized 'model' life as that is so common in the American society today.It's certainly not a masterpiece, and the lines of the plot are too much simplified and too obvious sometimes. But after all, this is the case with good classic comedy in the tradition of Chaplin. What remained for me are the memorable characters played by Bette Milder, Glenn Close, Walken, and of course, Nicole Kidman. What a great actress! Just watch her in the 20 seconds first plan screen shot when she is told that she is fired from her position as TV anchor. Real anthology stuff. Yes, this film will not get Oscars this year, and was not well received. Is this because the conservative atmosphere in the US today? Maybe. However, time will make justice to it - I am sure and people will get back to it and love it. It may become a cult movie, but for different reasons than the original 'Stepford Wives'. Right now I gave it 8 out of 10 on my personal scale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disturbingly entertaining, or entertainingly disturbing - take your pickIt seems to be the second movie on the topic, the previous one being some 20 years older. I won't go into comparisons, since I've neither seen the older version nor read the book, so here's just a few comments.1. Everybody notes the inconsistency between ?robots' and ?women with implants' concepts throughout the movie. So did I. That's, probably, the only annoying glitch that doesn't affect the overall impression - after all, the dubbing in the copy I saw was one key frame too fast, and it was much worse a trouble.2. I saw the very final scene coming (I'm not the only one, huh), and IMHO those should have been ?implanted' husbands there, not the househusbands-in-training.3. Bobby's plain terrific.4. Nicole's started showing her age. And it's good for her.5. Mr.Oz couldn't refrain from throwing in just a tiny bit of gay cliches, but at least they were up-to-date. Let's call it a cameo appearance of Mr.Bloom. And Mr.Mortensen, of course.6. Is it finally proven that all blondes are dumb? Or that all dumbs are blonde? Stereotypes, stereotypes. However, in my opinion one can afford them in a movie dominated by male inferiority (a nice change, for a change).7. The inferiority and superiority complexes can drive one whole small town crazy. I wish they had a chance to run Roger for President.Highly recommended. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never saw the original version of this movie (dated 1975) and I read some of the comments on IMDb... I quite disagree on the user comments and the rating up until now (5.6/10) is really off track. I give it a 9. Why?This is more a comedy than a drama and I feel the whole purpose of the movie is to use the old original plot to show, underline and criticize some of the aspects of current Western Social life. Stepford is an exaggerated example of many US cities (as well as European ones) suburbs and their defects.The actors are really good, the jokes are great and witty/ironic, music score is 50's style and perfectly matching and the opening title scenes are really nice - and already showing you where the movie will go (at least for me): a perfect life mediated by electronic gadgets delivered by big companies as a numb dream that may never become true (except in Stepford....).Good movie, good entertainment, good actors, to the point, witty - with a twist. I recommend it.</fullReview>

The costumes, by Ann Roth are beautiful and the setting are superb. Bette Midler is in top form and Roger Bart practically steals the show.

		<fullReview>This is a good movie. It may even be better than the original, which incidentally I liked very much. (I will say, though, that it's a crime Katharine Ross was asked back for this one- maybe for the Glenn Close role?)And now, the part so few people want to hear.This is, as has been mentioned elsewhere, more comedy than horror. Most fail to realize however, that it's more satire than either comedy or horror. Such *nasty* satire at that, that the humor becomes almost serious by the end of the film, and we should be left realizing that the first 15 minutes are meant to be as disturbing as the last 15 minutes.HELLLLLOOOOOO America! Stepford is supposed to be us. Worse, it *is* us. Put down the popcorn and think about it, because despite the laughs, this is a very serious movie.The original film was made during a time of radical social change in the sexual arena. Feminism and sex roles were revolutionary concepts, and were thus best presented in a horror film, with the main character teetering on the brink of the unknown, unsure of the fate which awaited her, until she was eventually consumed by her existence.This film is made during yet another time of social change: although we have largely accepted that gender roles and stereotypes are idiotic, we nonetheless cling to them because we don't know what else to do. Take a look at our country's division over same sex marriage- do you think it's an accident that they put a same sex couple in the forefront of this film?Stepford *is* America, a land where we have two kinds of people: men and women. The men act like men, and the women act like women. Anyone not fitting into the pattern will be *forced* to fit the pattern, because deviations . . . well . . . they're just not very nice.Are you still laughing? I hope you like irony with your popcorn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why do they do it? Can't Hollywood craft some new storylines instead of cloning endless remakes? As if three television sequels was not enough. Of course, if you're going to reshoot a film, you have to have some different angles but everything different about this new version of the 1975 work by Bryan Forbes is a mistake. The advances in cinematic technology could have made for some great visual tricks, but the opportunity was squandered. More seriously, whereas the original movie was a scary thriller with a strong feminist message, this regurgitation is simply played for laughs and - especially in the twist at the end - finishes up betraying the cause of liberation and equality. In 1975, one could well imagine men challenged by the increasing independence of women wishing to return to the halcyon days of the 1950s, but surely the idea that men - even podgy, middle-aged Americans - would want to turn the clock back 50 years to cake-making, crinoline-wearing dumb blondes is just too tired an idea to be credible. The men in this movie are truly awful - Matthew Broderick has lost his spark and Christopher Walken sleep walks through yet another evil personna - with only Roger Bart, as the camp end of a gay partnership, relieving the boredom. The actresses - those who aren't playing robots anyway - give strong performances with Nicole Kidman displaying a wonderful variety of facial expressions as she is sacked from the TV network and Glenn Close proving eerily icy (sadly the wonderful Bette Midler is underused). But nothing can prevent this from being a movie to miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite a Let-down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie for the sole reason of seeing Glenn Close, whom is a very great actress. Many people had also commented on how great the original was, so I was ready to see this supposedly great film. I was utterly disappointed. Obviously not sticking to the exact script of the original, the whole thing smelled of modern humor gone terribly bad.Nicole Kidman's character was, at times, convincing. Bette Midler's character was an obvious replay of her previous roles. Glenn Close's character was absolutely unconvincing. But the worst ever was Matthew Broderick's character. I just wanted to cry after watching him flounder about in the depthless role of the weak-then-suddenly-brave and-bad husband. And I'm quite sure the original Stepford Wives didn't have a gay couple--intended, I guess to put a modern twist on it. The characters didn't have pasts; they didn't have reasons to act the way they did. This small detail drove me up a wall: Faith Hill's character has a "blow out" at the party and sparks fly out of her ears. Another wife spits out money like an ATM. It is later revealed that the wives aren't robots; they're merely brainwashed. So tell me how a normal person shoots sparks out of their ears and money out of their mouths? It doesn't make sense!This movie could have been so much better if someone would have actually read the script and then threw it away and wrote something more meaningful. At the end of the movie, I was left there wondering what its point was.But there is one redeeming quality in the movie: the 1950s styled costumes. They were bright, well fitted, and the only thing interesting on the show. So if you are really into the costume thing, just grit your teeth and sit through this hopelessly ridiculous movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem with this film is that it could have been an absolute masterpiece... if they'd managed to figure out how they wanted to do the robot/brainwashed women. If you're paying attention during the film you'll eventually realize that the filmmakers obviously couldn't decide whether or not to go with robots, or with some sort of nano-tech engineered chips being implanted in the womens brains. My guess is that the nano-tech chips were what they decided on after shooting too many scenes with robot oriented material. My wife has decided that the fact that they couldn't make it one way or the other gives this film a D grade, but I tend to like it more than that. If they would've just gone with the nano-tech chips from the beginning the film would've been spectacular! The mood, set design, acting, and dialogue were very entertaining... thrilling, comedic...very engrossing. But at the end of the day you're still left bothered by the obvious fact that they reshot some material, but used other material and so it comes off as a film that isn't pure. I suppose it feels a bit insulting to the intelligence - did they not realize that the public would catch that glaring mistake? It just makes me sick to my stomach when I see something like this happen to a film that could've been amazing. Shame on whomever didn't approve enough budget to rewrite and reshoot EvERYTHING that needed to be fixed (to make it either all robot material, or all nano-chipped material). It's your fault the film has languished at the box office. In the future, remember that the public will catch you EVERY time you try to get away with less than 100%.In closing, if you're in the mood for an imperfect but entertaining film then this one should fill the bill nicely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a terrific comedy, with a great cast.I'm not sure at what point the "thriller" tag was added to its description, but it is perhaps the most misleading part of the advertisements. The movie is a farce, a series of comedic set pieces with a rough theme running behind them. Nothing unfolds during the movie that is unknown to anyone who had seen the trailers, or had even a passing familiarity with the first movie. Only at the very end is there anything resembling a plot twist, and that is mostly a set up for a brilliantly funny speech by Stepford's true mastermind.With the plot mostly finished before the script was even started, it's clear that the writers put their energy into individual scenes, with results that vary from above average to brilliant. People looking for continuity and logic had best skip this movie and just move along. This is light, funny stuff, and any attempt to dissect it isn't going to do you or the movie any favors.Everyone else, buy a ticket and prepare for treat.</fullReview>

Her performance, however, belongs in a slightly better film.Bette Midler, Roger Bart, and Glenn Close standout in the superlative supporting cast (also including Matthew Broderick, Christopher Walken, Jon Lovitz, Mike White, and country recording star Faith Hill). But... wait until you see (SPOILER!) Nicole Kidman as a Stepford wife.

There's no reason why a very good thriller (the 1975 version) couldn't be successfully updated and changed into an equally good satire, so I blame the writing and directing. There were some really funny lines and very good performances, but the screenplay was sophomoric and strident. A good dark comedy has to take itself seriously, but this movie expended more effort setting up the one-liners than it did developing a believable context for the plot. What a disappointment, and what a waste of a terrific cast. I'm going to run out and rent the 1975 version today, to show my son how to do it right!</fullReview>

I saw the ads w/ Nicole Kidman as this elegant knock-down gorgeous blonde bombshell only to see maybe 2 minutes of her in the looks the producers chose to advertize this film. I am ashamed that it worked as said advertising induced me to suffer through the movie and chime in with the Cinema crowd's constant laughing and heckling at the last 10 minutes of this "movie". Not only did I waste Nine Dollars on this waste of celluliod, I lost some respect for that all-star cast that apparently cannot find more artistic and creative work in their chosen field.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It boggles my mind as to why this movie was made the way it was made. I heard horrible things about it and eventually went to see it this weekend solely because I knew it was a chance to see a stellar cast of actors in a really bad film....most of the principles in the film have either won or been nominated for an Academy Award.The original book and film were a chilling portrayal of how far men would go to control women. The fact that both book and film came about in the early/mid seventies during the height of the women's movement made it even more relevant and both book and film stand the test of time. The movie I saw this weekend had nothing to do with the original material. Paul Rudnick is a great, quirky writer, but re-writing this material was not his forté. Plus, how much more muddled could this story be? In the original, Joanna was a troubled woman who had many layers to her character.....in this version, she's an obnoxious TV executive who you could really care less about. They couldn't even decide if the women in the film were robots or just had their brains altered. No one can seem to decide on the answer to this issue. They made some lame attempts at real horror by repeating scenes from the original film: Joanna discovering her robot without the eyes and the scene in the supermarket. The supermarket scene was the final horror in the original film....You knew the real Joanna had been murdered by her robot replacement and that there was no hope to be found. In this version, it's followed by a complete, nonsensical "happy ending" that was annoying to say the least.The only thing I can give this movie credit for is that they brought it into the modern age by adding a gay couple. At least that's something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Popcorn movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a comic retelling of the mostly dramatic 70s version, this one succeeds on that level. It's rather fun to watch but just don't get too deep analyzing the details. The main differences have to deal with the addition of a gay male character who is very funny, as well as a twist ending that I didn't see coming. There's an old saying that "Your imperfections are what make you beautiful." Obviously the men of Stepford have never quite grasped that concept. The movie could've been so much better but it's good for a laid back popcorn night of fun. I remember reading that there were a lot of problems with this movie being made, but luckily not much of that shows in the final product.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many of you seem to be missing the point. It's not a remake. It's a send-up, a parody of the original. It's a COMIC STRIP, OK? We may disagree about how funny it is, but that's beside the point. I didn't think it was hilarious, but it was funny enough that I enjoyed myself. And, the cast were obviously enjoying themselves! Actually, it's as much a parody of our times as it is of the original movie.There were enough plot twists and surprises to keep it interesting. Layer upon layer of uncertainty about who's what and what everybody's real motives were kept my attention. And, yes, this version made the women as unlikeable as the men. To me, that's the film's best quality. Nobody is spared from the skewer!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 2004 Stepford Wives is a delight! This is one of the few movies we have seen where the audience laughed aloud throughout the movie. That is even more exceptional because we saw it at the Ritz, which is an upscale, yuppie, adult, artsy movie theater.We are fortunate that we did not read too many of the critics' reviews, which could have diverted us from a wonderful movie.We normally do not like comedies; we find them too silly and slapstickish. But this one hit its mark in so many places. It was a spoof, first of all, on the original Stepford Wives, with some contemporary issues thrown in. It busted on reality shows, on career women, on male egos with inferiority complexes, on surface religious tolerance, on acceptance of gays, on gay relationships, on politicians, on marketing, on sci fi, and on community leadership.The electrifying ending let the whole thing unravel, and delivered its serious message that imperfection is more interesting and more fulfilling than perfection ? and that pursuit of perfection is a form of madness.And, of course, we loved the wrap-up cameo at the end.- David &amp; Irene</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Stepford Wives remake is hilarious! I just read the poor reviews and I'm astonished. Perhaps the writers lacked a satirical sense of humor or perhaps they all weren't familiar with stereotypes of Connecticut residents - or suburbia in general? Truly, if you consider yourself a politically aware person with even a smidgen of urban ethic, you'll love how this movie pokes fun at suburban whiteness. Nicole Kidman is inspired as powerful Manhattan executive in self-imposed suburban exile. But the show-stoppers by far are Glenn Close and Jon Lovitz, two geniuses of character and satire. There's even a gay subplot that made one lesbian watching this movie double-over with glee. Apparently the other reviewers can't spot a parody a mile away...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doomed Housewives trapped in Desperate Kingdom of a Twisted Disneyland of Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's but very little left of the wonderful modern Gothic Ira Levin wrote. Now, Stepford is not a small suburban village: it has become a gated community in Fairfield County. Joanna Eberhart, the doomed and horrified housewife of the original tale (as played by Katharine Ross in 1975) is now a ball-breaking ambitious and androgynous TV exec. The motivations behind EVERYTHING change. I can't reveal all, because I'd be spoiling it, but let's just say that this is quite a different Stepford... see, this is sort of a "Love" story.It' at times creepy... but it feels more like the story of a woman trapped in the desperate kingdom of a twisted Disneyland of Love...As for the acting: Ms. Kidman plays it to the hilt: she's having a ball, but it must have been exhausting. Bette Midler is DIVA (yes, well, we knew that) and she won't let you forget about it. Glenn Close is a hoot: she can camp it up and she does, whereas Christopher Walken gives a wonderfully adroit performance and Matthew (yum, yum) Broderick is actually kinda lovable as a some sort of Ferris Bueller grown up.Roger Bart plays a new element in the plot: a gay character. That is nice, but I think Rudnick took it all on the Screaming Queen stereotypes: sometimes it's like watching Paula Prentiss in male drag. I mean, it's very very very OVER THE TOP, and David Marshall Grant plays a smarmy gay Stepford Hubby... which is a not-uninteresting change.The thing that will bother many is the ending. And lemme tell you... it will be completely understandable. You can tell there were re shoots, and that at one point, the writer lost his way. I mean, I love the theme, I've read the book several times ever since childhood, and I like the cast, specially Kidman and Broderick... but I feel that Rudnick, in pursue of something that is never made clear (laughs? shrieks?)has Stepfordized a story that didn't need to be so.Oh well... being such a devoted fan of the original story this felt like having a Key Lime Pie that is not runny enough (according to the glorious Brigid Berlin, key lime pie MUST be runny)but still it is edible and tasty. I am guessing this is not going to be a mass blockbuster -- not running against Shrek and that kid with the broom- but it definitely has cult possibilities. And you know? It's like a guilty pleasure... like watching reruns of The Swan while gorging on Ben &amp; Jerry's Rocky Road.Oh, and about Faith Hill... let's just say she gets a lot of good laughs. In hindsight, I think that is an asset on the film: I actually found myself letting go and laughing heartily quite a bit. But oh, those opening credits!! Phew!!!Well, this version is as camp as tents up in a row. So, like Bobbie Markowe used to say in the original book, regarding her sparkling Stepford kitchen: "Go, look."Still, it could be worse. Scooby Doo, anyone?Oh, and speaking of Miss Kidman... whenever you get the chance RUN RUN RUN to see DOGVILLE, by Lars Von Trier, starring Kidman and an impressive cast of pros. It WILL change the way you look at cinema,forever...6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent but completely unnecessary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Stepford Wives has some really funny moments in it but in the end its one big mess. In this remake of the 1975 thriller, Nicole Kidman plays a professional woman who moves to the beautiful suburb of Stepford with her husband (Matthew Broderick), only to discover that all their female neighbors are a bit too perfect, lacking any semblance of personality or character, and completely subservient to the men. Along with the town's only normal woman, a sarcastic alcoholic played by Bette Midler, they must uncover the secret of Stepford and why all the men are all so deliriously happy. The original was a Thriller and a Mystery this one is a Comedy, Drama and a Thriller. So that's its first problem it doesn't know what its wants to be, even though I have never seen the original I know it has to be a lot better then the remake. The film has the comedy down with some really funny dialog but the rest falls apart. There are some dramatic scenes but its hard to tell if its making fun of itself and most of the dramatic scenes are boring anyways. There's no thrills in this movie so if your expecting something exactly like the original you will end up disappointed. The film has a top notch cast and that helps out a lot. First there's Nicole Kidman, she is very good as Joanna and at the end she's very pretty. Bette Middler is hilarious and she steals the movie having all the best lines. Glenn Close is good as Claire Wellington and she brings humor into the film. Christopher Walken is good as well and makes up for the horrible Envy. Matthew Broderick is horrible in his role and I think he is funny in some movies but most of the time I don't really like him and also he hasn't made a good film since Election. Jon Lovitz and Faith Hill are in it too but they aren't used much. Overall The Stepford Wives has a messed up story that's funny but not very scary like it promises. Rating 5/10 this is a decent movie to watch now that its out on video and worth watching if you're a fan of any of the stars involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Stepford Wives Remix.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review contains spoilers for both this movie, and the original, "The Stepford Wives."Even a horror comedy can have a cohesive story line. This story is more than convoluted. It's bastardized. It's completely lost. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE this movie. It's fun and it's funny, and there are some strong moments between Kidman and Broderick. Everyone put in good performances. But the direction was non-existent. I mean, come on. They didn't transplant the brains into robotic bodies. They simply couldn't make up their minds as to what they wanted to DO. So we ended up with a horrible mess. A fun mess, but still a mess. I totally believe that whole transplant device was invented after the fact and was never a part of the original storyline. I read the reviews and movie news and this movie was plagued with problems. Script problems, personality problems, emotional problems, set problems; you name it. And it definitely shows. In the original movie (don't know, don't care who saw it), the wives were murdered in pure cold blood, and replaced by robots. In the remake, they wanted a lighter theme than the cold-blooded murder of these women, so after filming the women like they were going to be robots, they began shooting them like they were altered, rather than replaced. In the remake, they wanted desperately for the women to be able to be "changed back," to be given their minds again. They wanted to redeem the male species of these atrocities of the original work, and thereby, they ruined their whole effort.The story got more than lost between all the arguing between producers and staff, etc. and this hodge-podge is what we got stuck with. They cut the Bette Middler/lawnmower scene because they changed their story line half way through the movie and no longer wanted to portray her as THAT robotic, but more "altered" instead. It didn't work. Once they gave us a human ATM machine who was controlled with her own personal remote, it was too late to turn around and sell the audience on the whole watered-down chips-in-the-brain premise (which was lame as all H3LL anyway), and expect us to buy it. So basically, they just said screw it, slapped it together and handed it to the fans. The movie made no sense because the movie was the first half of one movie, and the second half of a totally different movie. They should have sacrificed some of the low-brow humor for a more intelligent pass on this film, IMO. Had they had the cajones to actually "ring the bell" (by killing off the wives as in the original) with this attempt, the Bette Middler/Lawnmower scene could have been left in and this movie would have made a lot more fans happy. The one thing I *did* find refreshing was the inclusion of the first gay Stepford couple. It's about time Hollywood moved in to include everyone and not just the purely redneck, white bread, mainstream, over-christianized Americans. Nice touch. Too bad the rest of the movie wasn't as progressive.Although I highly recommend watching the original over this one, it's still a fun endeavor, however, and rates a 6.1/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

The ending was a great twist and was a riot.The original has long been a chilling favorite of mine and it can stand on its own in that thriller genre as much as this remake can stand on its own as a comedy and eventual thriller with a twist!I applaud Paul Rudnick, the cast, the Director &amp; crew: this movie was a blast and I would urge everyone to see it!Brava!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, so what! You didn't like it and I did. That's what life is all about, people - differences!I went and saw 'Stepford Wives' with my boyfriend, my dominatrix pal and her grand-daughter. Well, the 3 adults thoroughly enjoyed it and laughed our collective butts off! Why? Well:1 - The casting if PHENOMENAL! Kidman, Broderick, Hill, Midler, Lovitz, Walken and (especially!) Close are perfectly suited for their characters! Kidman's character is decidedly over-the-top and could not have been played better.... Sure, she's witchy (but with a B) in the beginning and you can't stand her, but she grows on you - much like moss. Broderick plays a perfect dweeb, in love with a girl 2 notches above his own standing in life. What you see of Hill is minute, but somewhat worth it. I truly believe she needed more of a role, but.... maybe in the DVD release &amp; deleted scenes? Lovitz is great as his own dweebish and goof ball self, and Midler does a stand up job as the perfect 'self help' author - trying to tell everybody else how to live their lives, all the while having a perfectly f---ed up life at home. And Walken and Close as the leaders of this little community are fantastic! Especially at the end!2 - The take on today is quite truthful! There are WAY too many people tied up in their high power careers and they don't see their own lives falling apart around them. Case in point - Broderick shows Kidman a picture drawn by one of their kids - the child is SHOOTING a gun at mommy! There are WAY too many cases of kids going wrong because mommy OR daddy (and more often, BOTH!) not being able to give enough to their kids.3 - There are a TON of funny lines and sight gags in this movie. But, humor is all based upon perception.... what I find funny, you just don't get and vice-versa.... Some people go off on seeing a guy get a ball in his balls on 'America's Funniest Videos' but I just don't get it.... Finally, don't let ANYBODY'S opinion turn you off from seeing this movie or make you go see it. Use your own best judgment. If you like it (as I did), tell people! If you didn't, well, same thing, TELL people. Personally, I can't WAIT for the DVD - just hoping that they show deleted scenes, bloopers and all those kinds of great extras!!ENJOY!!!</fullReview>

I tried to watch this, seriously tried, but before the first hour was us I was folding laundry as that was much more inspiring then this film. My advice, go do some laundry yourself instead of wasting your time. Too much dressing (great actors) not enough substance...a sad, sad film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Stepford Wives is a remake of the 1970's title by the same name. It does have a few differences but is along the same storyline. First I am going to start off with the plot. This does not contain spoilers. Johanna is a successful TV show producer and has just come out with a successful new show, testing the loyalty of married couples. However, an enraged contestant attacks Johanna, proving her show a failure and getting her fired. Johanna then goes into a state of shock. Her husband Walter decides to move to a quiet town so she can recover. But little do they know, this small, high tech town has a few dark secrets of it's own. This movie is definitely less dark than the original, however it does have some creepy elements. The android women are much more realistic in this fine remake, which I prefer to the original. This film is much more comedic than the original. The only flaw about this movie is the fact that they do not explain the human to android process in detail. But I guess that just leaves things to the imagination. There also is a strong emotional tie-in with Johanna and Walter. The drama is just right and does not interfere with the the rest of the movie in a bad way, more like a good way. Overall, this is a great movie, now go watch it!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What we got here is a soft comedy with feminist/women's-lib overtones which is a remake of a 70's film. The story looks attractive at first sight: a dream little village whose men have exchanged their annoying wives for android copies of them that are much more sexy and helpful than the original ones. That's Frank Oz, a little genius whose career is full of ups and downs...Putting aside that the matter of women's lib is a little bit out of date nowadays, we find that the movie is not very funny (which is quite a handicap if we're talking about a comedy) and the ending is so rushed that it looks like someone cut out 20 minutes of the film.The best of it? The best of "The Stepford Wives" is the cast, no doubt about it. It is always a pleasure to watch Nicole Kidman, 'cause she's able to shine even in the worst circumstances. But she's not alone, you may look at the cast list back there at the movie's main index: Christopher Walken, Bette Midler, Matthew Broderick, Glenn Close... what a waste of talent.*My rate: 3.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, watched Stepford Wives last night and I honestly can't say I was impressed. It was so...disjointed.A lot of the acting was so...dead. Mind you, they didn't have much to work with, really. I like Matthew Broderick but he was just nasty in this one. No decent lines or anything, and he was robotic at best when actually doing something.Christopher Walken is usually excellent stuff and he did well with what he had, but the content was lacking. Nicole did well. She had some good moments, I think. Bette was Bette...nothing fab, but not bad either. Funny at the right moments. Whoever played the gay guy was doing well, too.The problem with the whole thing, I think, is that there wasn't a focused path for the movie to go in. There were moments of comedy (the AOL line was precious) and moments of extreme creepiness/psycho-horror, and then just moments of drama, but none were really pushed to any good extreme and it really felt like it needed to be a movie of extremes.You know....pick one. A comedy? A drama? A psycho-horror? A scifi? I was confused as a viewer -- should I laugh, be scared, or both? They didn't push the philosophical aspect of it nearly enough. The best scene they had was the confrontational one with Nicole in the middle surrounded by the guys...but they fell just short of making it really, really good. So many lines missed that should have been, so many opportunities missed for really screwing with the viewer's mind and leading them down a path of demented logic.See, the things I like about those movies is when they take some really weird and wacky concept (reprogramming your wife to be perfect, for example) and then make a demented argument so good that you find it hard to dispute. Those are the times that they really grip me and make me think and/or creep me out. And Stepford missed.Not a bad watch, I don't think my life was wasted, but it fell short of where it could have gone, I guess.</fullReview>

The cutesy-poo whodunit ending make me want to vomit and every time I saw Matthew Broderick I was expecting him to yell out "Go-Go Gadget" because thats about the limit of his acting ability. So bad is this remake that I was actually shocked and taken aback at how different this is from the original. Even the controversy the original movie had over the womens lib movement back in the 70's is nothing compared to how horrible this movie is. This movie just goes to show that the American movie audience has lost its edge to distinguish what is good and what is bad in the filmed entertainment industry.The only thing I must strive for you to do if you see this abomination is to see the original and then compare the two. you will be shocked just as I was in how the quality of films have degraded over the years.</fullReview>

It turns ugly when they drop the comedy element and try to scare you in the last 30 minutes of the film. Also, with the continuity. They switch back and forth from saying the women are the original woman with microchips in their brains to saying they are robots. If there were only chips in their brains, why would the "robot" of Nicole Kidman be laying on the surface when it opens it's eyes. Doesn't anyone else find that strange? Seriously.

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original 1975 version, so I can't say whether this version is much better or worse than the original one. What I do know is that the idea behind the movie isn't very original, but can, without being great, still become something nice,...But it didn't. Of course it is funny to see how the men all want to change their bossy, career driven wives into loving, caring spouses, but it is oh so predictable. The women are all really unpleasant people (to put it in a very nice way), the men are their little slaves... When the families of two of these women move to a little town where they see that all the man can do what they want, don't have to bother about what the women think and clearly are the boss at home, the husbands want to change their wives as well.Than of course you get the obvious scenes which belong to this kind of movies. It is so predictable that you wonder why you even paid money to watch it. It seems that you wrote the script yourself ... when having a bad hangover from the weekend before. In my opinion, this movie really shouldn't have been made. I give it a score of 4,5/10. I sure hope the original was a lot better!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original take on "The Stepford Wives" led to three TV movie sequels - "Return of the Stepford Wives," "The Stepford Children" and (inevitably) "The Stepford Husbands." This new version makes no impact at all, so we'll be spared any followups... especially since "The Stepford Children" (in which Barbara Eden and Don Murray come to Stepford with their kids, and Mum becomes suspicious about how incredibly polite and well-behaved the kids are), the only one I've seen, is better than this movie. That's right, Jeannie and Sid from "Knots Landing" are better value than Nicole Kidman and Matthew Broderick.In Frank Oz's latest attempt at making a good comedy - or indeed a good MOVIE - that doesn't involve all-out fantasy ("Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" has its admirers, but I'm not one of them), he and writer Paul Rudnick apply a heavy hand on the satire from the word go, with stressed-out TV executive Kidman (who I sincerely hope is better as Samantha in the "Bewitched" movie than she is here) kicked out of her job, supportive husband Broderick resigning and the whole family moving to the peaceful town of Stepford, a place which so obviously signposts that Something Is Not Right Here that only a blind man could miss it. Everybody's slotted in place, and the "real" people here are no more flesh-and-blood than the Stepford wives themselves; the network presentation that begins the movie - Kidman's character winds up being fired when a man who was humiliated by his wife on one of her reality TV shows, having shot said wife and several of her boyfriends (!), crashes the meeting and opens fire on her - is actually considerably more interesting than what the movie's really about, the shades of what happened on Jenny Jones's show notwithstanding; this viewer wished the movie had been about what led up to that moment, which would have spared us comedy that isn't funny (except for a scene where Kidman, Roger Bart and Bette Midler sneak into Faith Hill's house and hear her having really great sex), attempts to turn the movie serious that fail completely because it hasn't come across as light in the first place, and a climax that turns the movie from a failed commentary on the roles of men and women into yet another perfection-is-bad-and-fake-flaws-are-good-and-real lecture. (On this showing, give me perfection any day.)The cast is mostly thrown away - Midler stands out, but only because she never seems to take what she's doing seriously (and yes, in this case that is a criticism) - and while there are a sprinkling of good moments like the aerobics scene set to "A Fifth of Beethoven" and some amusing lines (Kidman's character on hearing that one of the husbands used to work for AOL: "Is that why the women are so slow?"), the movie's entirely free of any kind of effect, other than a deadening one. If only that husband had shot her in the beginning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rental?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We went and saw this at the "dollar theater." Was it worth a few bucks? Sure. As a work of generic entertainment--and it is just that--this comedic remake of "Stepford Wives" is sufficient. It doesn't break pace even slightly. There are a lot of laughs, even if some of the jokes are retreads. The caliber of the cast used is utterly mystifying, but then look at movies like "Mars Attacks!" Nicole Kidman dispatches her role as the effete TV executive with ease. She stretches from sterile TV star to manic fish-out-of-water suburban mom to perfect housewife without missing any beats. You get the impression this is child's play for her. Of course this movie is beneath the A-list cast: Close, Kidman, Walken, and Broderick (maybe Midler is B-list with A-list credentials?). I suppose they were all gathered up to create a worthy remake, but it needs more, much more.Thinking back to "Biloxi Blues," I was hoping for more interaction between Walken and Broderick, but, alas, 'twas not to be. Still, it's always fun to see Walken on screen. I for one am glad he rarely turns down a role. Close is probably the best of all on-screen: she tackles the role of the ultimate housewife-gone-mad with great alacrity.So, go ahead and wait for the rental--but make sure you rent something else too. You'll have a short night otherwise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a shame "test audiences' got their grubby mitts on this movie. Apparently they wanted the robot wives to be human and persuaded the producers to do re shoots - but what you end up with is a confusing, weakened story. I wonder if the original version with Kathryn Ross had test audiences. If so, would they have insisted on changing that genuinely spine-chilling ending? Maybe the problem sprung from turning a thriller into a comedy. The original could afford its black ending; the remake, being much lighter, required something more consistent with the new tone. But did it have to be inspired by Scooby Doo? "Glenn Close! It was you all along?!?" "That's right! And I would have gotten away with it too if it weren't for you meddling kids!" Also, I think there were too many unanswered questions in the remake. If Nicole Kidman was never a robot, why did she feel the need to pretend to be? What happened when she and Mathew Broderick descended into the pit? Why did Bette Midler go back to that really unflattering "writer's" hairstyle? It all felt too convenient and it's a shame really, because the cast were great. They just needed to be in a film with a more intelligently crafted story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything looks so unlikely in Stepford that it's quite easy to figure out something's wrong. A bunch of geek husbands married to wonderful and excellent in bed women cannot exist in reality, that's why they can only be cyborgs (though real women before). The message this picture wants to get, ie better genuine human beings with their qualities and faults than unnatural and artificial ones, is not that original... anyway the cast stars Nicole Kidman, Glenn Close, Matthew Broderick, that means a great cast. Formers Tom Cruise's wife can now be considered one of the best actresses ever, feeling at her ease even in this peculiar role. Frank Oz represented Stepford town in a very appropriate way, showing this welcoming and friendly community so unreal and false and teasing American way of life. In short a nice and entertaining movie with a good plot and on a serious subject, unlike the first appearances</fullReview>

Is Frank Oz responsible for taking the concept, adding some huge names, firing the continuity person and dumbing down the script? If not, who should take the blame?The obvious inconsistencies should make the writers ashamed of themselves. Are these women really robots who dispense `singles' and have boobs that get bigger at the touch of a button or are they humans with microchips in their heads?And how come so many scenes made it into the trailers but didn't make it into the movie? Isn't that misleading advertising?I'm guessing the actors won't be all that proud of themselves either. Wooden, predictable and boring only just begin to describe their efforts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wasn't sure what to expect when I walked in to this film. I sort of knew what it was about (Trailers, reviews), and decided to try and make sense of all the mixed reviews I had seen lying around. Well, I thought the film was bizaar. It was a very dark, comedy thriller. Well acted by it's main leads (Kidman, Broderick, Middler, Lovitz, Close and of course, Walken), the film takes us into the strange town of Stepford, where something strange is going on. Some how, the men have found a way to transform their hard working, big business wives into house wives. These are The Stepford Wives.A lot of people don't like it. They hate it for all the wrong reasons. The plot is not thick enough, the acting isn't Award Winning, The story is silly. The editing is bad. This is nothing but whinging. Yes, some of those are true, but in the end, that is what can make for a good movie.from the beginning, you can see where the film leads. There doesn't seem to be any particular twist, however the film does start and finish in a way that there is no room for a sequel (PLEASE DON'T MAKE ONE!).Worth a look. Just turn off your brain, sit back and go with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revenge of the Test Audiences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Judging from the movie as a whole (the remote controls, growing and shrinking breasts, etc.) It's obvious that the wives were supposed to be robots. I have this gut feeling the test audiences wanted a happy ending. How could you possibly bring back the wives if they were dead and replaced?So they had to re-shoot and add additional scenes that suggested brain implants instead! This way it could be reversible.This makes sense considering they had so many reshoots to do. It also makes sense as to why some scenes contradict the whole brain-implant idea.It's also apparent there were scenes that ended up on the cutting room floor. Some scenes seemed to come prematurely such as the discussion between Joanna and her husband about Joanna not liking Stepford when they hadn't even lived there one day. The trailer also has a few scenes in it that did not wind up in the film.I'm not sure how much was Frank Oz (who also had to reshoot the ending to Little Shop of Horrors) and how much was Paramount. But it sure does feel like Frank just gave up. This film reminded me of the "Love Conquers All" version of Brazil. Something that was not of the directors original vision.Either way, this slap-dashed affair of a movie with stars who seem disinterested in being in it and an editing job that feels as if a lot ended up on the cutting room floor should have been put on the shelf for good. Or at least until it was made the way it they were intending for it to be made.Perhaps we'll see a directors cut some day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`The Stepford Wives' is kind of a slow story. Slow because it seems to take a ridiculously long time for the major characters to figure out that something is amiss in good ol' Stepford, CT. Considering that the plodding story line is coupled with lackluster dialogue, an unremarkable soundtrack, underwhelming cinematography and the complete non-exploitation of some remarkably beautiful women we come up with a pretty disappointing remake. Actually, the movie starts well. Joanna Eberhard (Nicole Kidman ) is a relentlessly aggressive TV network executive and it is fun to watch as she introduces a new show at a company function. And for all intents and purposes the show downshifts as she subsequently suffers depression (burnout?) after things don't go exactly as she planned. Thus her husband Walter (Matthew Broderick) quits his job and whisks her off to suburbia to heal both her and their marriage.  But things are odd in Stepford, and we find perfect ? and lovely - wives matched with normal looking guys (shading toward unattractive, actually). As Joanna comes out of her funk she, paired primarily with new friends Bobbie (Better Midler) and Roger (Roger Bart), begins to suspect something is amiss. But even if we had never heard of the original film or book it is hardly a revelation when the trio cracks the case. The only truly funny scene in the whole film occurs when Walter shows his wife (while she is in her darkest hour) a picture one of their children drew. It is so insensitive it is flat hilarious and is the only real surprise of the movie. Otherwise this stacks up to be a 6-8 chuckle film.Disappointments: Faith Hill's appearance is brief and unrevealing (in an acting sense); Christopher Walken and Glenn Close (the unofficial, it seems, leaders of the community) are not challenged very much; truth be told this is no where near as sexy or dark a film as trailers indicated it would be. Conclusion: another in a long line of unnecessary Hollywood remakes. Rating: 2-1/2 stars.</fullReview>

I felt like I completely missed the plot and story line. One minute Joanna is giving a speech for the company...three minutes later she's discovering the secret of the stepford wives, the movie moved far too quickly for any plot or character development.Reviewers raved about how comical the film was but to be honest, I think I maybe laughed once, and I laugh even in very serious movies. Bette Midler wasn't even that funny which surprised me, the titles of her books were the funniest things she ever said. Not impressed? You can bet I wasn't.

If you aspire, more sensibly, to place the jokes within a deeper fable/parable/satire, you have to understand some fundamental rules of storytelling, such as: Your audience will accept the impossible, but not the improbable. [SPOILER] I, for one, am willing to buy that a guy would and could build a robot wife who also functioned as a cash machine. But I refuse to believe that she would dispense singles. [END SPOILER]Most of the jokes are silly and self-indulgent. The plot makes no sense. The actors are squashed under the director's and producers' elephantiasis. Go! Enjoy!</fullReview>

Yes, it's easy to compare the remake (and I'm still not sure that term is appropriate here) with the uneven though intriguing and layered original. At the very least, Bryan Forbes did assume his public had a brain at its disposal.The main problem, I think, is a genuine lack of cohesion and consistence of tone(s). It just doesn't work, either as a comedy, a satire or a plain entertainment. Everything is hammered without an once of subtlety. To bad, considering that wow of a cast. Let's hope screenwriter Paul Rudnick (whose name should be forever next to the word "camp" in dictionaries) will take a break. I can't help but wandered what Don Roos (that is, the one of "The Opposite of Sex") or Stephen Daldry could have done with the same material. A real drag, no pun intended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie tried to mix multiple genres and just didn't work. It was very boring in between the funny scenes. Me sitting in the movie theater just wanted to take a remote and hit "fast forward". The movie had a lot of nauseating all happy scenes, that didn't contribute anything to the plot. I feel they were inserted just to eat up time. I feel this whole movie can easily be edited into a 1 hr primetime TV episode.Also there were many conflicting things that just didn't make sense. Making you feel there are different scripts and plots that were edited together, I cant even say combined. Most of little scenes aren't linked to each other.Also I could predict the entire movie from just the TV trailers. There really isn't anything to see, its just like waiting for the end, no climax. Plus I feel like I wasted my time in the theater, if this was HBO I would have turned off the TV after 5-10 minutes. Only reason I sat it out was because I paid $10 to see and I wanted to get something.This movie was a good idea, but just is too unorganized. It would have made a very nice horror/thriller movie/crime drama/horror sci-fi. But instead it tried to be funny, but not in a SNL or scary movie style funniness or a parody. This mixed genre just made the movie nauseating. There is subtle humor, but it just isn't mixed in very nicely (mostly Nicole does it).In my opinion, if u need a movie that u can, um, be affectionate to your partner in. Stepford Wives is perfect, its so boring and not really interesting u can um take care of your partner.</fullReview>

(Memo to screenwriter Rudnick, from the mouth of that smart, talented underground filmmaker, Bruce LaBruce: "being gay is not enough." Think about it, please). Bryan Forbes, Katherine Ross and Paula Prentiss, et.al did this movie much, much better back in 1975, and it should have been left at that. The Stepford Wives is, for all its efforts, another pointless, badly written (the plot holes are already legendary), and yes, mechanical Hollywood remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Promising at first, but collapsing after 45 minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake offers a good cast, a promising team and first and foremost a very intriguing plot. Unfortunately the filmmakers could not entirely decide whether to make a sci fi thriller like the movie from the seventies or a comedy. It has a wonderful opening-credit sequence which hails the fifties with their nightmarish perfect-housewife-commercials and groundbreaking kitchen inventions. Then the movie sets his tone introducing Nicole Kidman as a superpopular TV-host (Mr. Kidman was never colder as a character)who bathes herself in the success of her cruel real-time TV shows. After getting fired for basically ruining peoples lives with inhumanly disgusting shows she finds herself in the superclean and somewhat unreal little town of Stepford. While Kidman's character is very well developed, her husband's is not. Matthew Broderick fails to persuade us that he is a true heartbreaker and a great companion for a career-woman such as Kidman. You don't believe that she actually fell in love with him, he is just to weak and boring.The couple just does not seem to belong together, the same problem we found in COLD MOUNTAIN with Kidman and Jude Law. Later we do not want to buy that Broderick's character is turned around by the macho-attitudes of the Stepford-husbands, he is too nice for that.In the third act the whole thing collapses because the filmmakers do not succeed in turning this comedy into a really frightening thriller. This story is interesting because of the horrible truth being discovered at the end. Instead of leaving us with an open end which would make us moan the characters we fell in love with before (Kidman, Bette Midler) this movie delivers us a poor explanation that takes away the horror - and the horror is the most attractive part of this story in the first place. THE STEPFORD WIVES wants to be a comedy and a thriller, wants to be sarcastic, full of secrets, exiting, a little heart worming and shocking - and is nothing of the above completely. A straight thriller with this cast and crew would have made a great film. OK, I also had some laughs...only to bow my head during the last 15 minutes!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(spoilers ahead...) One of the most distracting, illegible credits sequences (with vintage homemaker footage) announces that you're in for a timid, silly movie. It sets up a light mood but also suggests, "Thank God that we've eradicated oppression so that we have to go all the way back to the sixties to find patronizing imagery of women." Rubbish! How you can handle this subject matter without touching on recent feminist achievements/defeats is mind-numbing. Much like G.I. Jane, this toothless movie suggests that the real enemy that women face isn't revisionist conservative male nitwits trying to force us all back to the fifties, but a powerful, modern woman-hating woman. gosh... how ironically/accidentally hateful!What you may not know is that this tested so poorly that a new ending (or two) had to be shot. Clearly the original ending involved making a duplicate of the wife and doing away (?) with the original. The damage/alterations that the wives sustain is not explained by the new ending, nor is the elevator descent with a blanked robot form, nor Bette Midlers hand in flames, nor a woman whose mouth is an ATM machine.Three figures loom large over the material Frank Oz, Paul Rudnick &amp; Danny Elfman. The material is directed broadly, written broadly and announced loudly with what is now Elfman's bag of musical clichés. Between the 3, there isn't a one of them that understands subtlety. You can feel Rudnick's pain as the script occasionally requires him to express something legitimate and not mock it. He's going to shoehorn that material into heavyhanded "camp" if it freaking kills him. The gay character played by Roger Bart is not funny unless awaiting each new bitchy, sassy eunuch role is a thrill for you.You know how some bad movies make you angry? This one makes you indifferent. It's just the typical half-assed crap we've come to expect from Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take off the rose-colored glasses; the original was NOT better, just different.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Oz directs a tongue-in-rouged-cheek redux that stumbles a tad as it doesn't quite commit fully to either a black comedy or an over-the-top satire, doesn't quite reach "thriller" quality, doesn't quite step up to the plate. BUT it's inevitable: When remakes are released of 'classic' movies ? from Ocean's 11 to the Stepford Wives ? we don our rose-colored glasses and wax poetic about how much better the original was. In this case: Wrong. Different, yes; better, no. This remake is true to the premise of the original, but takes a fresh, skewed approach, going for camp and parody where the original was a drama; going for speedy, full-bodied character development right out of the gate where the original dragged its characters along woefully, with hangdog looks and dour expressions substituted for dialogue that told their backstory. Uber-urban couple Joanna and Walter move to the Connecticut 'Burbs this timeafter Joanna has a complete nervous breakdown when her big city career implodes. She's a power woman on a power trip, and her cord gets unplugged big time. So, Joanna's wrassling her own identity crisis when she meets the blissful, beautiful, subdued society of Stepford. Despite an peculiar speech pattern, Nicole Kidman is splendid as Joanna, as she struggles to come up for air in Stepford. Instead of enshrining Joanna as the Feminist Goddess fighting deadhead domesticity as in the original, this version shows her warts and all, and the audience seemed to feel she got what she deserved initially. There is a sweetness in Joanna trying to find her softer feminine side, her nesting and nurturing instincts, even when her hyper type-A personality kicks into gear, resulting in hundreds of cupcakes screaming 'compulsive overachiever.' Her new best friend Bobbie (Bette Midler) is, refreshingly, NOT a sympathetic character, and (perhaps inadvertently) Director Oz has crossed her with Miss Piggy, as an egocentric, combative, acerbic writer who wallows in a slob-sty lifestyle with her pig of a husband, the ever-idiotic Jon Lovitz. The injection of a gay couple into Stepford is an interesting twist, and Faith Hill is utter perfection as the Stepford wife with her wiring going awry. Christopher Walken is a bit underused, but as always, reliably weird and oddly ominous as the head honcho of the sexist men's club, which property is dead on from the original movie. Matthew Broderick is, as Joanna succinctly states, her 'goofy Walter,' all wide-eyed and struggling to assert himself as his emasculated testosterone gets refueled in Happy Man Land. Glenn Close is a wasp-waisted dervish as the untiring, endlessly organizational, insidiously irritating Claire, who leads the women of Stepford in their goosesteps. The good news is that, unlike the sluggish, drably introspective original, this Stepford Wives is glamorous and richly imbued with vibrancy. The bad news is that -- OK, social commentary opinion ahead, feel free to tune out -- sadly, the kneejerk ridiculing and debasing of all things traditional and June-Cleaver-like is overt and heavy-handed in Hollywood, and wrapping it up in glitzy, star-laden movies like this may be "fun" but it has more than a bit of a nasty, mean spirited undertone. In today's world of latchkey kids, rampant divorce, domestic violence, lack of honor and integrity, shirked personal responsibility, crude and rude antisocial behavior, etc., we could use MORE family tranquility, dedicated husbands and wives, and respect for the sanctuary of a welcoming home with an unselfish, loving, committed father and mother who embrace the most important job in the world: raising better children which leads ultimately to a better world. The burgeoning trend of 'stay at home Moms' in America seems to be an uplifting, promising development in improving the quality of society through improving the quality of family. It's unfortunate if movies like The Stepford Wives slap these folks down for their 'old fashioned' values.</fullReview>

If they're humans with chips in their brains then what's with the sparking ears, growing breasts and the ATM machine (who refills that cashbox anyway?). Just because they've made it into a (supposed) comedy doesn't mean they can abandon all sense of internal logic.As for that, it tries really hard to be a comedy but, except for 5 or 6 snappy one-liners, ends up as a vaguely embarrassing piece of slapstick. Unlike the classic original, there's no tension since 99% of the audience already know the Stepford secret, and it can't even claim to be satirising anything. The 70's version was a comment on people's reactions to the burgeoning feminist movement, but what is there to satirise here - reality TV? Lame.Over the top performances (except for Broderick who sleepwalks through his underwritten role) and too many plot holes make this just another of the countless pointless remakes which unwisely choose not to take the original seriously.Please, please Hollywood: By all means keep on making remakes, but why not remake some s****y movies and turn them into something good, rather than the other way round.</fullReview>

Nothing worse than coming home from a lousy job, and arriving at a worse home life. Selfishness, greed, and immaturity, is in my religion considered great sins, and creates great carnage. This movie hits the issue that God never made us robots, but gave us free will; the robots were not real people. No choice, like in 'A Clockwork Orange'. This would be a very dry relationship. I don't think that either the control freaks on both sides were happy people. I found acceptance in whatever my fate is, a better way; for my life has been one of misery, and I found control and illusion. One can just plan and do their best. The humor lacked on this heavy subject, and this movie got across as a TV movie. Christopher Walken is the only saving grace, as usual I give it a 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

Joanna makes friends with a best selling author, Bobbie Markowitz (Bette Midler), who just moved to Stepford. They see that life is just perfect at Stepford. The wives are just too perfect, so they want to know what is going on in the town. They break into the Stepford Men's Association to see what the men are up to. The next day Bobbie is now perfect. Joanna will be next. This is one movie you can miss. With such a great cast of actors, they missed the boat. They made this remake into a comedy, but it still doesn't work, except for the last scene.

		<shortDescription>Could've used a lot more spark and subtlety</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS A FEW SPOILERS)Maybe it's just the wrong time to remake "The Stepford Wives." Or, perhaps the story isn't conducive to being remade. After all, Ira Levin's 1972 novel is a horror story, as was Bryan Forbes' 1975 film. Now, 19 years later, with the term "Stepford Wife" so enmeshed in our lexicon, making a horror film would certainly prove futile.That's clearly the reason writer Paul Rudnick and director Frank Oz opted to turn Levin's work into a campy comedy. We already know the Stepford wife's secret (unless, of course, you've had your head buried in the sand all these years), so Rudnick wastes no time in revealing the inner workings of one very early into the film.But if you're resorting to comedy, it better be funny. And that's where this "Stepford Wives" fails miserably. There's no doubt Rudnick can write hilariously funny stuff. "In and Out" had genuinely funny moments and his "If You Ask Me" column in Premiere magazine (under the nom de plume Libby Gelman-Waxner) often features witty, brilliant zingers.Unfortunately, none of that's evident in "The Stepford Wives," which has a few chuckles, a couple of good lines. I'll admit I laughed when one of the Stepford husbands announces he worked for AOL and Joanna whips back, "Is that why the women are so slow?" And Claire's plea for a screwdriver was nicely timed, too. Scenes begin with tremendous promise, then, like a malfunctioning Stepford wife, peter out, lose their spark. Bobbie and Joanna's break-in of the Men's Association proves to be merely a tease, for nothing even remotely funny or terrifying comes from it. Granted, the Stepford ATM was awfully intriguing - if only there were many more such bits of inspired novelty.Subtle, this film is not. And this film needed subtlety. Instead, almost everything and everyone is over-the-top, from the faux reality shows to several performances, including those by Glenn Close, Roger Bart and Christopher Walken. Understated humor would have worked wonders. Too bad Rudnick didn't see the need for it.Kidman's always a radiant screen presence. She has a good grasp of Joanna, but her role, like the film, feels flimsy. Singer Faith Hill might very well prove to be a good actress some day, but here she's given next to nothing to do. Bette Midler has a few clever lines, but she, too, is playing someone we've seen numerous times from her.One huge problem is the nonexistent chemistry between Kidman and Matthew Broderick, a smart actor who seems woefully miscast. They just don't play well off each other. They both look as if they'd rather be somewhere else, doing something else. Their scenes need zing; instead, we get zip.Then there's the new ending. I am a fan of the original ending. I liked its pessimism. I have no problem with Rudnick coming up with a new twist ending. Alas, it's not unpredictable and at the end, we're left wondering if this is the best Rudnick and Oz could devise."The Stepford Wives" proved to be a disappointment, despite boasting an enormously talented cast. It's almost as if this film unintentionally became a Stepford version of the original film and novel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Stepford Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This recent remake (God, I'm starting to despise that word) of the 1975 thriller is a comedy bordering on slapstick. It's like a bad joke told by a guy who heard the joke originally as a serious story, but he did not get it or like it. The new "Stepford Wives" is an affront to the original film, the original book, the themes covered in both and yet another symptom of the plague of remakes polluting our society these stark, dismal days.It's all too bad, because the film had one hell of a cast. Nicole Kidman, Matthew Broderick, Glenn Close, Bette Midler, Jon Lovitz and last, but not least Christopher Walken star in this tale of forced, mechanized perfection, but their talents pretty much go to waste. (Not to mention Faith Hill who has less than two or three non-memorable lines).So where did it all go wrong? Frank Oz is hardly an incapable director and the topic could have possibly been interesting. The idea of men building a utopian society by turning their wives into subservient fembots definitely had social resonance in the 70s. Women were still struggling in a society of "evil male oppression," and film and literature addressed the problems of conformity and death of individualism quite prominently at the time. However, times change and the last thirty years changed quite a bit. Women, while some still claim to experience this "evil male oppression," are generally free to pursue whatever career goals they wish and conformity is such a problem right now that no one talks about it. Consequently, it's quite clear that the remake of "The Stepford Wives," if it still wanted to be the incisive satire akin to the original, should adjust its story to the contemporary social climate.Well, it does and it doesn't. It does in the sense that the film is made strictly for money, reassures the audience instead of disturbing them, and changes the terrifying ending of the original into a glossed-over, resolution bordering on the Stepford definition of perfection. It's a sell-out film and it's ending is designed to please everyone - women and men alike. It's simply politically correct. And garishly so.Thus, concurrently, the film doesn't succeed as a satire at all. It doesn't take sides in fear of offending somebody. While it starts off with a noncommittal comment on women exploiting men on TV, it quickly returns to the feminist-deliberation-style of its predecessor. Nicole Kidman's Joanna lands in Stepford and finds women abhorrently friendly and perfect. However, by its end, "The Stepford Wives" turns around and tells us it's not about women oppressing men, men oppressing women, or gay men oppressing other gay men - it's about the terror of the traditionalism and conservativeness of the 1950s. Yeah. The shocking revelation at the end of the new "The Stepford Wives" has nothing to do with the themes it purportedly explores. It's simply a bad joke about a time that has come and gone even before the original "The Stepford Wives" was made. This type of ending, of course, has absolutely no appeal, satirical or not, nowadays. It is completely absurd and mocking - as if to tell you "Ha ha, this is what your dumb-ass gets for sitting through this film!"And no one gets hurt, or everyone gets hurt equally. The men are reassured at the end that if they stick by their woman, more ambitious or less ambitious than they are, they are "real men" and therefore are good. Men who feel threatened by their wives or girlfriends are weak and exhibit signs of extreme insecurity, career-related or sexual. Finally, women and gay men, as long as they are witty and don't surrender their neuroses and lack of happiness to make life easier for their partners, are, in their own little way, perfect."The Stepford Wives" thus shows us nothing more than current politically-correct attitudes held by the majority of our society. It doesn't seek to question why these attitudes exist in the first place, or, if they are accurate, what motivates the social forces in these particular ways. Thus "The Stepford Wives" is a symptom of the very thing which it claims to be about - a sign of dangerous conformity and fear of offending others. And, I am just about sick of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Director Frank Oz is best known for playing Yoda in the Star Wars movies, voice work on the Muppets his comedy films such as "What About Bob?" , "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" and his best work, "Bowfinger". I am embarrassed for him after seeing his remake of "The Stepford Wives". Not sure if this should be called a remake since its predecessor by 29 years was a much darker, more serious film than the current fluff. This script is awful and the casting is equally atrocious. Matthew Broderick is no actor. He peaked at "War Games" and should just sit back and spend his husband money from "Sex and the City". I fully understand Nicole Kidman wanting to take a walk on the lighter side after her last 3 or 4 years, but even Kidman can't make this one work. Glenn Close steals most of her scenes as the smiling twin sister to her Cruella Deville role from the Dalmation movies, but even her role falls apart at the end. Christopher Walken is good for a couple of laughs, but overall this is a real stinker. Bette Midler does little but pose in a frumpy manner a couple of times. I did like the premise with the twist on the previous lives of the husband and wives, but of course, it was not developed properly. Terribly disappointing, so skip it if you are looking for a comedy, or pick up the original if you want a darker drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a waste. Instead of the subtle, chilling, satiric style of thenovel, this filmmakers opted to use a campy, over the top,annoying style that sinks the entire film. It's a big joke, and a badone at that. All of the characters have not only been turned intojerks, but also into complete idiots, so any suspense or intriguethe film might have had is completely lost. And why oh why did theyhave to work in all those lame jabs about reality shows? I thinkmost of us are not only tired of seeing them, seeing more andmore idiotic looking ones being produced, but also of beingsubjected to lame, half-assed satire of them. And why haveWalken and Lovitz in the film and give them nothing interesting todo? Aarrgh! This movie annoyed me on many, many levels, but I'lladd one more thing: Do we really need any more movies with Larry King cameos?What is it about Larry that makes him so irresistible tofilmmakers? When will Larry get his own movie, and not have tocarry the dead weight of Kidman, Midler, etc? It's obviously whatthe public wants, seeing as how we don't need any more moviesthat turn classic novels into garbage.......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ira levin Cannot be Too Happy!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ira Levin wrote a great thriller book "The Stepford Wives", in 1975, which I read at that time. and then, not too long after the book was published, a movie was made of the same title starring Katherine Ross. It was a serious movie dealing with husbands wishing to exchange wives that were, in their minds, imperfect, for a more perfect model.......the perfection being very subjective.The original wife (the "imperfect" one) was then murdered and the "perfected" version took her place. This was a suspenseful, thrilling movie which frightened people. Mr. Ira Levin also wrote "Rosemary's Baby" which also dealt with a husband wishing to change his wife to better fit his schedule for his acting career........even if it meant being Mommy to Satan!!I saw the new "Stepford Wives," and found it completely outlandish and having absolutely nothing to do with Ira Levin's book, or the origianl movie. The title should have been changed in some way as, for insance, "Stepford Wives 2004" Perhaps that would have given people some idea of what travesty they were going to watch.Also, for those who do not know, Mr. Ira Levin, also wrote a great book named "IQ 81," around the late 60's or early 70's. This book was never made into a movie..which is a shame because it truly would be hilarious. It deals with a virus that attacks 90% of humankind and leaves the survivors of this virus with an IQ of 81. The remaining population which was immune to this virus kept their normal IQ -- however, now they had a society that consisted of 90% of its population with an IQ of 81 being cared for,in one way or another, by 10% of the population with a normal IQ!!! Very interesting reading!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My vote of 5 is actually generous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this movie a 5/10, and that was pretty generous. To be fair, I laughed a few times, and this movie was not nearly as bad as my measuring stick for all-time worst movie, 2003's The Medallion. However, there are oh so many things wrong with this movie.I have not yet seen the original, but I have heard much about it and it appears that it was a thriller/horror flick. That sounds like the way to go with this material. Oz's version leans heavily in the direction of camp, and the one-liners start to pile up like driftwood.The characters react in totally illogical ways; no one seems to be at all fazed or even mildly surprised about the sinister goings-on in Stepford. Furthermore, there is absolutely NO chemistry between Kidman and Broderick on-screen. The few scenes that do attempt to convey emotion are static and stale and incredibly awkward. It seems to me that a trained chimp could have done Broderick's job in this film, which seemed to consist of complaining half-heartedly and looking slightly confused. And don't even get me started on Christopher Walken. The man has played some incredible roles and he is as intense an actor as you will ever find, but in this film it seemed as though he were playing a bad parody of one of his Saturday Night Live roles.As if this already weren't enough, we are treated to a jangly edit, where it seems that everything is rushed along just a bit too quickly, and it looks as though vital scenes were just clipped right out of the movie. A solid, slow development of characters and mood is trashed in favor of more unfunny one-liners. Furthermore, Oz changes direction on us mid-movie and attempts to create a creepy sci-fi thriller vibe, but it falls flat after all that camp shoved down our throats in the first 50 minutes.As a testament to how bad this movie sucked, the best aspect of the whole film was the outrageously stereotypical flamboyantly gay Stepford 'wife.' He was the only funny thing in the entire movie. That is just plain sad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible interpretation of a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "stepford wives" with the brilliant, Katherine Ross was and still is a classic critique of today's society. And very accurately problemitizes the very sexist structures that are set in motion these days. This "remake" is a joke, a piece of filth in comparison. It makes light of what must and should be taken very very seriously. Not that occasional humor in a movie like this is unwanted. But to turn it into a campy comedy featuring some good actors and actresses giving terrible performances is reprehensible. The featured gay couple was done rather messily and I for one am tired of having the "Funny, Frivilous" stereotype of gay men tacked on to every piece of Hollywood trash that can be churned out. It's a new breed of homophobia that I can not tolerate. ----spoilers--- Also the fact that that Glenn Close's character turns out to be responsible for the creation of "the wives" is a total misinterpretation of the original film. Only men were responsible in the original and that speaks for itself. This is a terrible "remake" that is not even worth further critique. Rent the original, don't waste your money on this new and shiny piece of filth. It is an insult to the brilliance of the original. F-</fullReview>

This movie was truly neither funny nor scary. It was also not a trenchant piece of social criticism. It was long and quiet and boring. Don't mean to be rude.But it was really bad. Nicole Kidman had absolutely nothing to do except recite lines like, "We should get out of here" and the always popular..."What's going on?!" None of the yeoman actors cast were well utilized. They all looked like they were acting through clenched teeth on their way to a paycheck. The script was horrible, filled with hack-y jokes and over-the-top "Here are the themes of the movie" speeches. Not worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm usually not the most critical person as far as movies are concerned. I find that the vast majority of films are OK, just watchable, or average. Occasionally, though, I come across one that makes me think of all the other things I could be doing instead of spending $7.00 and two hours in a theater. This Stepford Wives remake was one of those times.I really never thought it could have been as bad as it was. And it really was. From the ridiculous opening scene featuring Joanna Eberhart (Nicole Kidman) as the head of a TV network showing previews of outrageously over-the-top reality shows to a convention of shareholders, to the all-over-the-place and completely out of left field ending, this film was boring, uneven, unfunny and completely unsuspenseful.Supposedly the unsuspenseful part was unintentional, though, as the filmmakers seem to have purposefully gone a completely different route than the makers of the original 1975 interpretation of the Ira Levin story. That film was a suspense thriller masking a dark satire. This remake appears to be a straight comedy. Only one problem: it's not funny! The laughs are few and far between, and the funniest moments are only remotely amusing.The dialogue is shamefully cliché and self indulgent. Throw in a gaping plothole (involving a robot) and a cartoon-like mechanical dog and you've got a big ole' disaster of a movie. The new ending is unnecessarily complex and seems to have missed the point of Levin's original story completely.Everyone involved is so talented, including director Frank Oz (The Dark Crystal, In &amp; Out) and especially the cast, which includes Bette Midler, Glenn Close and Christopher Walken! And of course the fabulous Nicole Kidman! But it's not any of their faults, the movie just doesn't work. Perhaps the writers shouldn't have tried to change the material SO MUCH. The point of the movie just feels lost. Still, I don't see how this could have gone SO wrong. Avoid at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing....but still a "step" down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been a fan of the original Bryan Forbes 1975 version, I went to see Frank Oz/Paul Rudnick's comical reinterpretation of Ira Levin's satirical horror story with a wee hint of curiosity. The end result was a mildly amusing rehash, but nothing to brag about. The fact is, since this is being billed as a satire, it doesn't work. The satire was already built in, so what was there the need to improve upon?The book, published in 1972 (the year of "I am woman, hear me roar".)was already a meditation on the paranoia of the women's liberation movement. Paul Rudnick's (In &amp; Out, Jeffrey) script essentially camps it up and tries to bring a 21st Century twist to the material - with very spotty results.Nicole Kidman plays a wealthy, powerful TV executive whose reality TV show concept backfires and is almost shot to death. Her husband (Matthew Broderick, a long way from "Ferris Bueller") has the answer to all their prayers. Move to an idyllic Connecticut hamlet where the women are robotic subservients to their successful husbands.One entertaining aspect is the male "wife" of one the citizens, played well by Roger Bart who spouts his zingy lines like arsenic darts. Better Midler scores a few laughs as an author of a derogatory memoir about her mother ("Mom I Love You, But Please Die") and Glenn Close has a lot of fun with her Martha Stewart-from-hell role.But Christopher Walken is completely wasted as the town's main creep as is for that matter, so is Kidman, and the movie never quite settles on the right tone. At least the 1975 version got under your skin, while this one only emanates the occasional chuckle.**1/2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be the stupidest movie I've seen in months. The previews lead you to believe that the "Stepford Wives" are all a bunch of robot replacements. For most of the movie, they maintain this premise. Couples move to Stepford, the men join the gent's club, then they replace the wives with robots. Then in the last 20 minutes of the show, they pull a complete about-face, and suddenly the women are not robots at all -- they only have a couple of micro-chips implanted in their brains and they are all magically "cured" when the chips are burned out. WTF? Earlier in the show, one has sparks coming out of her ears, they even show one of the robot "replacements" lying on a table. The robot replacements are all slightly improved over the originals (better figures, hair, etc). Yet, as I said, they are all suddenly back to normal in the end. It's like they had a big argument about whether the women should be robots, or just have implants, made both movies, then accidentally merged the two together. Stupid, stupid, stupid.Even all that would be forgivable, it the movie weren't just dull. Boring, slow, predictable, yada, yada, yada. Save your money and avoid this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the movie up until the very end (not brilliant, but amusing...) However, it seems to me that everything fell apart due to a poor editing decision. I'm assuming they shot different endings to the film... and the one that they used (they have implants in their brains) DOESN'T WORK. 1) Faith Hill's character would not spark at the head nor would her breasts grow when they hit the button on the remote... 2) The woman robot would not be an ATM machine 3) Bette Midler's character could not hold her hand on the hot plate without it burning... The list goes on and on... When we left the theater we were like "Someone in Hollywood is about to get canned big time." It was a VERY critical error in plot line and continuity. It made NO SENSE. The events in the film should have made for an ending in which the women were robots... I really hope that Paramount yanks it from theaters as quickly as possible, and either re-releases it with a more consistent ending, or perhaps on video.</fullReview>

There were too many inconsistencies in the plot of this movie. The wives all turn back to normal at the end which makes no sense because they are robots and in the commercial showing how the wives are made it says that all that happens is microchips are put into their brains. There may be some sort of explanation that I didn't see because I was watching it at one in the morning. The book that this movie is based on was a social criticism but this movie was not realistic enough and wasn't at all close to the way our society is. If it was made to be more of a comedy than it was very poorly done because none of the people in the theater laughed through the movie. The movie just wasn't interesting either. Most people left the movie halfway through to see THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK. If you still want to watch this movie, then go watch the commercial for it and sneak into the last ten minutes.</fullReview>

I was beginning to think that I knew how to pick 'em, even if (as with Bus 174) I was one of two people in the theater. Well, my string of luck has ended on an exceptionally dismal note with the new Stepford Wives.Nicole Kidman, I suppose, is more convincing as a high power media executive than as a courtesan in Moulin Rouge. And there was a mild interest in seeing Bette Midler without the usual cinematic efforts to disguise her diminutive height. But positive and neutral comments end with these. The suspension of disbelief required to make movie horror, even comedic horror, believable never gets off to a decent start. The characters are flat and without internal motivation. The situations are entirely implausible. It's an embarrassment to everyone involved, something to be left off one's resume. Somewhere between zero and one on a scale of ten.</fullReview>

The original "Stepford Wives", appropriately dramatic in intent, concentrated on a single character (played graciously by Katharine Ross) gradually uncovering a frightening and deadly chauvinistic plot against the women of an upscale Connecticut community. The 00's version seems to rely solely on the current one-trick pony of coarse, campy humor, with little to no regard for traditional storyline. Add to this a pretentious parade of identifiable pop icons (Kidman, Midler, etc.) in order to sell this flimsy film and you have an audience whose sensibilities have been bodysnatched and brain-eaten by rampaging, robotic redux.

The cast alone was enough to send shivers down my spine. Such campy ensembles have been devoid from cinema for awhile since Mars Attacks. Having not seen the original, my knowledge of the film was limited to the seductive teasers and trailers of the re-make and the word of mouth of others familiar with the original story. I was fortunate enough to view a preview screening this week and with the start of the opening credits and Danny Elfmanesque score (is nothing sacred?), I must say, I was engaged. On further noting Frank Oz and Paul Rudnick's collaboration, I was indeed expecting great things. To my chagrin, I was let down.Without sounding pessimistic and spoiling, for all the "hits" this re-make succeeds, they do not compensate for the misses. Camp and fun are one thing but, the necessary flow and logic (in expositional arc, that is) were just too terribly vacant. It was fun though to see the great cast together in all of its kooky glory and Rudnick successfully created a subtext that echoed the dark themes of misogyny. His comment on gay marriage was also appreciated but seemed a little forced and out of place. I do feel, that this would have made a great musical! A Tim Burton take would also have been cool. Overall, however, one might forgive the creators for their folly and take heart in the heart of the film, however lukewarm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(spoilers)2004, the era of PMS (Post-Martha Stewart) seems ripe for a dark-edged satire of sex roles like Ira Levin's 'The Stepford Wives', filtered through three decades of suburban flight, backlashes against feminist backlashes, and rampant consumerism fed by fear of almost everything. Add to that, Levin's story added a distinct layer of body-horror and phobic preoccupation with cleanliness which Bryan Forbes's original 1975 adaptation cleverly exploited---in its honey-glowed cinematography and women whose flowered dresses melted into the black hole of a sun, the whole film played like the most horrific deodorant commercial imaginable. The safest of suburban retreats (perfectly manicured gardens and gleamingly clean supermarkets) became threatening vistas of unease. It was dark-humored, but at its core, it was pure horror played out in sunny kitchens and picket fences---the diary of a mad housewife gone animatronic. It's an unnerving, underrated classic, up there with Kaufman's 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' remake as a dystopic vision of modern society kept under control through homicidal identity-theft.Zombified, robotized suburbanites who compulsively yearn for an unthreatening social structure regardless of the cost? G.W. Bush's America is the looking-glass realization of these visions, where the importance of appearance and the desire for a simple, uncomplicated society override the messiness of social pluralism and whatever else lies beyond the cul-de-sac's driveway. Overseen by a biting satirist like John Waters, a 'Stepford' remake might have had a chance at exploiting the inherent irony of updating this story to 2004, despite Waters's propensity for narrative crudeness. Or perhaps the two Todds might have succeeded at mining the rich potential in upping the story's ante in an era fueled by SUVs and internet shopping; either Solondz's malcontent nastiness or Haynes's tone-perfect genre revisionism would have served the concept well. What we get is Frank Oz and scenarist Paul Rudnick who offer up a remake of sorts but the results are a very distant echo from the 1975 original. The emphasis is funny---not satire or sneaky-but-horrific funny---but broad, cartoon-speed funny. In this version, Joanna is transformed from a housewife/photographer to a show biz exec who is punished with expulsion after one of her reality show participants goes postal at a network meeting.Joanna and her nebbishy husband (Matthew Broderick, duller than wet crackers) and their nondescript children move to Stepford where everything is 'House Beautiful'-perfect (although it's more perfect in an art-directed way than a suburban fantasy way, a further symptom of the film's cartoonishness). The tired, disheveled Joanna doesn't belong and her displacement is underscored when she bonds with two other outsiders, newcomers Bobbie (Bette Midler, funny but criminally underutilized) and Roger (Roger Bart as a swishy gay sweater queen---one could make the argument that the film contradicts whatever message it's offering about respecting individual differences by throwing in such a creaky stereotype, but since he's probably a stand-in for writer Rudnick, we'll give this plot point a pass). Joanna and company uncover the real reason behind the townswomen's preternatural obedience, sexual satisfaction with their nerdy husbands and preoccupation with home decorating. In the Martha/Queer Eye/Trading Places age of media-directed home improvement, it's hard to tell this is supposed to be so astounding but it's not the least of the film's failings that these contradictions and ironies aren't confronted. It's confounding as to what Oz and Rudnick were trying to accomplish with this remake. The basic scenario is too unnerving (or unnervingly real in light of contemporary mores) to function as a light comedy but that's exactly what the filmmakers serve up---the actors are given characters void of motivation or nuance, but are encouraged to play those non-characters at maximum speed and volume which after an hour of non-development, becomes unbearable to watch. Kidman might have survived had she been given the original Goldman script to work with, but with little help from Rudnick or Oz, she's left flailing; Joanna in the remake might have made sense if she had been a failure as a housewife or openly disdainful of the expectations placed on her as a newly minted suburban mom in a harshly lemon-pledged suburban hell. As it is, Joanna's mildly resentful of not fitting in, and there are one or two poorly drawn 'should we stay or should we go' arguments between her and Broderick's character. The 1975 film portrayed Joanna as a character skating along the borders of paranoia, persecution and uncorroborated suspicion---all that's now gone, replaced by a gimmicky comedic tone that goes for cheap laughs and blows the film's housewives-as-robots conceit in the first act. Midler and Bart are at least able to run with the film's Wile e. Coyote/Roadrunner comedic tone, but the film's weightlessness and inconsequence eventually swallows them up along with pros like Glenn Close and Chris Walken (proof that hiring an experienced, expensive cast can't save a bad script). Who needs character development and suspense where there's yucks to be had?'The Stepford Wives' (1975), while not a perfect film, was willing to peer into some dark and heady fantasies of identity displacement and suburban discontent in a era of shifting sex roles. Behind the perfect homes and pretty lawns was an unnervingly prescient look at the disappointment and anomie behind an impossibly idealized existence. 'The Stepford Wives' (2004) is an empty, soulless, mechanical film that, while technically accomplished, smacks of film-making-by-committee. Maybe it was made by the droids from the first film??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got to see this movie in a test audience setting 4-27-2004. The movie was very predictable and formulaic. Which is ashame because I really like the principals involved. Matthew Broderick was very under utilized and Glen Close / Christopher Walken "phoned" in their performances. Bette Midler and a new face Roger Bart were actually quite good and their performances really stood out, especially Roger Bart. I hope to see more of him in the future. Nicole Kidman is especially beautiful here but again this was not a great role or performance for her, and I really like her work. She was wasted here.I don't mind that they converted the original movie to a dark comedy ...I think was a good idea, but the jokes were tired and not very original. This was the first time I'd ever gone to a test screening and I really wanted to like the movie... but I couldn't. It has "Death Becomes Her" feel to it, but the performances don't measure up. This is worth a matinee or rental, but if you really want to laugh a lot ... look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pointless remake and falls down on so many levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original film in a while, but I remember absolutely loving it especially for the quality of the acting and how interesting it was. This remake of The Stepford Wives is not as abominable as the Psycho and Wicker Man remakes, but that is saying very little because very little, if anything, in this movie works at all.I will admit the way the film looks is not bad at all, at least the scenery is striking and the photography not on slip-shod level. However, coming from a very keen musician and music enthusiast I did find the soundtrack rather forgettable. However that is the least of The Stepford Wives' problems.The story for starters is very predictable, right up to the contrived finale. The black humour is lowbrow and misses the mark far too many times to make it truly funny, and some scenes drag on for too long. The cast is great on paper, but Nicole Kidman looks bored, Bette Midler's character grates and she overdoes it and Matthew Broderick is miscast and in an embarrassing way.In all honesty though, the characters are not at all likable and mostly very uninteresting. So all in all, a great disappointment and one of my least ever remakes. 1/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the interest of full disclosure, I will admit up front that I automatically give extra credit to any film with Nicole Kidman. I think she is worth watching no matter how bad the film actually is. This one wasn't that bad. It held my interest mainly because of Kidman and some other great characters.Bette Midler played a great role as a bohemian writer with a little boy husband (Jon Lovitz). Lovitz was funny as he represented all the husbands who just wanted to be waited upon as they played games. I recall someone saying that if our wives were not around, we would all be in boxer shorts, smoking cigars, and watching football. The men in this movie were pretty close. They were all married to strong women and just couldn't deal with it. Too bad! Let's make them robots.Matthew Broderick was cool as Kidman's husband, and Christopher Walken, well he plays weird characters well, as he did here. The ending was a huge surprise, and everything made perfect sense.Great line about Conneticut. Wish I could remember it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Silly remake of the 1975 cult classic film of the same name.I think The Stepford Wives was just one of those films you couldn't remake,as the sequels to the original,Revenge of The Stepford Wives,The Stepford Children etc never lived up to the standards of the first film.So this should of told us that a remake of the original was going to fail. The remake here has a really strong cast,Nicolle Kidman,Glen Close,Bette Middler and Christopher Walken who seem to be waisting their time,in fact its only the cast who seem to be holding this film together and their the only thing that makes this movie worth watching. The film starts off promising,Nicholl Kidman plays a big media star who through her live shows has attracted bad publicity and ends up losing her job.She becomes depressed and decides to take her husband and children to live somewhere more peaceful and quiet.So the town of Stepford seems like the ideal place.When they arrive at Stepford everyone especially the women seem a little too perfect.And I'm sure you all know the rest of the story with out me explaining it all. The biggest let down in the film is towards the end instead of getting more exciting it just gets really silly and its like as if they have put an ending together in a rush,as if the writers couldn't be bothered to make an exciting ending. The film does have its amusing moments and is okay for easy viewing,the location is beautiful and the women do wear some lovely clothes.The film is alright to watch on an afternoon if you have nothing better to do,but don't expect anything like the original film The Stepford Wives as you will be disappointed.On the other hand if you didn't like the ending of the original and you would sooner see a version with a happier ending,{and i think this is what the writers were trying to do here}then this could be your sort of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie a fair few times, and I think there are some very harsh comments here about it In my opinion, all of the actors turned out polished, funny, and dry performances, and i thought it was a great ensemble piece. Above all, i think where some of the misconception has come from is that people are comparing this to the original film. fans of the original movie have to realise that the two are entirely different in style and genre . The remake is a lighthearted black comedy, a gentle and interesting cautionary tale. It was not intended to be a devastating socio-political Gothic horror,and does not pretend to be. All in all i enjoyed this movie very much and i think and it does its job well, so i say leave it alone,just enjoy it for what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood steal an old classic title, which has always remained in your psyche, so when you hear they are making a remake you are already halfway to the cinema, with the old movie running in your mind. You're thinking and it remains the maxim..."THEY WOULD NOT MAKE A REMAKE OF A MOVIE UNLESS THEY WERE GOING TO IMPROVE ON IT OR EQUAL IT OR APPLY AMAZING SPECIAL EFFECTS TO IT OR APPLY IT TO THE PRESENT DAY...OTHERWISE THEY WOULD NOT BOTHER MAKING IT!!!!" Nowadays, you get caught out, THIS MOVIE, "THE FOG", "ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13", "THE PINK PANTHER", "THE OMEN". If they're not better versions...ditch the project. It is a ploy that works, as the movie title already registers with you, you are always drawn to see a movie with that title! It's a form of brainwashing, like with this film you're thinking about Katherine Ross and her realisation of her neighbourhood and subsequent predicament and your on a journey with her. This film, you don't care about anyone's predicament and you want it to end!!!!! I personally gave up at the "card in the mouth and money coming out scene".Kidman was Kidman; Midler was Midler; Broderick,Broderick; gay bloke, gay bloke and Walken,Walken. You could have given them any script, storyline and they would have delivered the same "performance".The only interesting premises taken was that you could make a perfectly babe delicious female, skin, organs etc. and no matter what you look like as a bloke have sex with them whenever you want...Utopia, and for this film slightly perverted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE STEPFORD WIVES is Frank Oz' radical re-thinking of the 1975 classic about the mysterious town of Stepford where everything is not as neat and clean as it appears on the outside. In the original, Katherine Ross and Paula Prentiss played two relatively new citizens of Stepford, who desperately tried to figure out what was going on with the women of Stepford before falling under the "spell." In this remake, Nicole Kidman plays the Ross role, Joanna, who is now a high powered television executive who was fired from her job and had a nervous breakdown, who is brought to Stepford by her husband Walter (Matthew Broderick)to start a new life with her husband and children. Stepford has been updated for the new millennium: there is even a gay couple played by David Marshall Grant and Roger Bart (THE PRODUCERS; DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES), but it's the same old evil. Unfortunately, Oz plays all his cards right away and all the suspense of the original is drained away. In the original, there is some mystery as to what's going on with these men and women, but there is no mystery at all in this version...it's spelled out for us five minutes after Joanna and Walter arrive in Stepford. Not only is the mystery of the wives completely spelled out but the mystery of the Stepford Men's Association is laughable in this version...it comes off looking like a bunch of teenage boys sitting around drinking and playing video games. It also breaks my heart to say, as a huge Nicole Kidman fan, this is the first performance of hers that was really a disappointment for me. I found Kidman's performance to be broad and affected, somewhat like a Stepford wife before she is Stepford-ized. There are laughs to be found here and they come from Bette Midler, a joy in the Paula Prentiss role, Bart, Christopher Walken, and Glenn Close, who are perfection as Stepford's version of Welcome Wagon, all set against Oscar-worthy scenery and costumes, but next to the original classic...this is a pale , pale copy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a disappointment this film is. I saw it at a sneak preview over a year ago, and hadn't seen it since then, but just remembered that I didn't really care for it. Until the other night when I watched it again, I was reminded just how disappointing this film really is.I saw this before I saw the original from 1975, and that version is so much better. It's eerier, and much more intense than this version is. In this film, they're too focused on making it funny, which it really isn't at all. I was also disappointed that Bette Midler didn't have better lines, or wasn't in as much of the film. She's my favorite actress, but I just felt that she wasn't given enough to work with in this piece. Nicole Kidman was alright, but she's always great in every role that she takes. Matthew Brodrick was good, and was the dork that he was meant to play, however in the original although the husband of the Kathrine Ross character was a loser type, he wasn't as big of a nerd as they made Matthew Brodrick. That was the other mistake of the film, was that they changed a lot of the characters' characteristics. It would have been better, as just a straight thriller, and not a dark comedy, because it really didn't work well that way. The first twenty minutes of the film are pretty good, but in my opinion it's pretty down hill from there. There are a few funny lines from time to time, but generally speaking, it's not scary, not intense, and not funny. It failed on all accounts. The real sad part, is that you can tell a lot of work and production went into the film. Frank Oz and his crew spent a lot of money, time and effort into making the film, and in the end it was just a bomb. Glenn Close was probably the best looking she's ever been, and one of the best performances and roles I've ever seen her give or be in.I really wouldn't recommend this film. It's a let down right from the start, and I wouldn't waste your two bucks renting it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Happened to Stepford Wives?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the Stepford Wives, I must say that I don't agree with the comments describing it dreadful, crap, etc. On the other hand it wasn't impressive either. It was just an ordinary, watchable movie and rather confusing. I was able the watch it until the point I stopped and told myself that something was wrong. It was like watching two different films especially beginning and the end of it. In the beginning, we were being implied that Stepford women were models and Nicole Kidman was a closest example of human being close to it but definitely with lots of flaws. But, but in the end what we have is there are actually no robots. I think something happened during previews that the director had rearrange the movie and it was all messed up. The ending of the movie was wrapped up in a rush that you actually don't realise things like Matthew Broderick saying"Oh, she was never a robot whilst she had been robot for like a couple of minutes. There are a few question marks in my head. What happened to the dog? Has it ever had the chance to be a normal dog again? What did the gay guy see from the window inside the club? I am pretty sure the film was much longer than its running time and a big slice of it was cut on the way to the cinemas. Such a shame as it might have made more sense and maybe a bit more enjoyable and made more sense if it was shown as it is. ** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a mess! The remake of The Stepford Wives takes everything that made the original such a good movie and throws it all away. Instead, the movie goes for comedy and generally misses its mark at every opportunity. I'll admit that I did find myself smiling and almost laughing at a couple of scenes, but they are too few and too far between. And when the funniest bit in the movie is a 10 second Christmas sing-a-long, you can probably get an idea of how lame I found most of the comedy.But the biggest problem I see is a lack of any sort of realism. I understand that with comedy it's often necessary to stretch believability. But The Stepford Wives attempts to inject realism by also being a drama, a thriller, and a sci-fi movie. It's none of these. There's no drama when the movies main plot point is beaten to death within the first 15 minutes of the movie. The mystery of Stepford in this remake doesn't exist. As for being a thriller, The Stepford Wives is the kind of movie that all along you just know everything will be fine in the end. What kind of thriller doesn't at least make you think someone may be in danger? Finally, most of the sci-fi elements are presented in cartoon format. How can you take that seriously? In the end, other than a very few moments of comedy, this thing is a stinker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ending here is beyond redemption, but otherwise this remake of the 1975 film from the novel by Ira Levin is not (entirely) bad. It's a different sort of film than the original and probably would amuse (if not offend) Ira Levin if he were alive today. But to put it bluntly, the film is a sellout to politically correct mentalities and could quite easily be called "Revenge of the Stepford Wives." (Actually there was a TV movie from 1980 by that name that I haven't seen.) The original Stepford Wives starred Katharine Ross and Paula Prentiss and was a dark science fiction satire with only a few chuckles and a decidedly dark ending. This film is played mostly for laughs and is full of all sorts of silly (shall I say stupid?) updates, like having a gay couple instead of a black couple and making the wives (prior to their coming to Stepford) very accomplished--CEOs, scientists, etc., while the husbands are Neanderthal nerds. Nicole Kidman's Joanna Eberhart was a top TV exec while her husband Walter Kresby (played sheepishly by Matthew Broderick--note that Joanna did not take his last name) is a kind of ordinary joe and caddy to his wife.But what about the premise? Let's be honest guys. Wouldn't it be wonderful if our wives were totally devoted to our comfort and pleasure? If they obeyed us and always kept the house and themselves spotless and catered to our every whim? If they didn't get moody and were always rational, etc.? Isn't it the natural state of the human male to be king of his castle and to have dominion over all he surveys? Well, at any rate here's an update on the Stepford Wives for the new millennium, an expansion of the concept, if you will. Every man has not only a totally devoted and loving wife, but a totally devoted and loving mistress (or two). They would be robots of course, manufactured as consumer goods by General Electric, Microsoft and Intel. But here is the zinger: every woman would have a slavishly devoted husband and secret lover, etc. And while we are at it, they would have loving, appreciative and accomplished robotic children. In other words, nobody would actually interact with other living, breathing human beings. How crude, how disgusting. Instead all humans would interact only with perfect robots perfectly designed to make their world a heaven on earth.Or, more likely we would just be hooked up to an elaborate software program with an utterly convincing virtual reality in which we would have a loyal and loving spouse, two extracurricular lovers..., etc.Fly in the ointment? I think it would be called boredom.Bottom line on this film: a few laughs, a good cast wasted, but a nice documentation of filmland executive stupidity.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<fullReview>Yet another movie I didn't rush to see but was expecting something better than this.When high powered TV exec and host Johanna Eberhart (Kidman) has a breakdown after a tragic event caused by one of her shows, her husband Walter (Broderick) decides they need to get out of the city and into a nice country town. When they arrive they find themselves in a surreal world, which looks for all intents and purposes like 1955. Men spend most of their time relaxing and doing man stuff with other men while the women watch the home, always striving to be better wives. Everyone seems happy, but something seems amiss. Johanna intends to find out what has got into this town.Its alright, but just thought it could have got crazier and more intense. Seeing as it was directed by the guy who's the voice of Kermit The Frog, maybe my expectations were unrealistic. The movie did remind me though of how much I rate Matthew Broderick. This is probably his best role since Project X (the one with the monkey). Seriously, he must be peed considering he's pretty much in the John Cusack mould of actors, but hasn't had anywhere near the success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Expect it to be the Usual Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen the Stepford Husbands and knew what happened in that movie, but I have not seen the original Stepford Wives nor have I read the book. Frank Oz's Stepword Wives is a good film. Most of those I watched the movie with expected it to be mainly a comedy, but it turned out that much of the jokes in the movie weren't really that funny according to my tastes. Those who come to a movie expecting to laugh usually force out laughter but after a while this died down. The movie started to get serious when there is the threat of Nicole Kidman's character being changed from the career woman to the slave wife. It's a moment of dread.Towards the very end of the movie, however, there is a twist that I thought was quite strange. Throughout the film I kept thinking, "These men are horrible. Why would they do this?" The sad thing is that many of the attitudes these men have mirror the attitude a significant number of men have. Many women out there also buy in to the perfect wife ideal. With this connection with reality came a feeling of horror and shame almost. Then, as it turns out, the whole thing was orchestrated by an old woman. So I started scratching my head and kept wondering what this meant if translated into the real world. Men control women but they do so because of women? Maybe there are two types of women: the high-flying career women and the old women seeking the chivalry and gender roles from a more traditional era. Maybe the conservative women are the ones influencing men to be dominating and this is hurting the career women. Perhaps men are the way they are (dominant and controlling) because of the demands of these types of women, who ruin everything for all other women.Another aspect of the film that annoyed me was the way that everything had to be spelled out and verbalized. The plot itself revealed much about the gender themes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely not worth the price of a video rental</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The default review of this movie on the IMDb website pretty much says it all. There are MAJOR problems with this movie that leads one to wonder what the HECK the editors, the writer(s) or both were thinking as they went about their work. I have a feeling it was the editing if for no other reason than it's hard to believe that the writer would have left a hole the size of the grand canyon in the script or the screenplay that leaves the viewer totally confused about whether the women are robots or real. What's worse, there appears to be unmistakable evidence of both which makes the whole movie seem totally nonsensical and hardly worth the price of a DVD rental (which I unfortunately paid, and got a scratched DVD that kept freezing up and had to be painstakingly cleaned to add insult to injury). Apparently one of the deleted scenes goes a long way towards explaining the paradox of robots/real women and one has to wonder how the final movie could have POSSIBLY survived the editing process without this missing scene. I just can't believe that when the movie was pre-screened by the powers that be that every single person didn't walk out of there asking whether or not the women were robots or real.If you can manage to shrug off this seemingly insurmountable obstacle the movie has a hint of potential. In fact, with good writing and a good screenplay coupled with modern special effects, this movie COULD have been great, especially given the cast which is certainly what drove me (and probably 95% of others) to rent the movie or watch it in the theater. It's hard to believe such a great cast signed on to make this movie with a script this bad, which again leads me to believe that something horrific happened in the transition from script to screenplay and/or in the editing process. Matthew Broderick, Nicole Kidman, Christopher Walken, Glenn Close, Bette Midler and Jon Lovitz have all played leading roles in successful Hollywood films (with Faith Hill thrown in for some eye candy :) ), yet even their combined stellar talent wasn't enough to save this movie from the wrath of critics and viewers alike. The director even managed to get shamefully mediocre performances out of these "A list" actors and actresses.Unless you're a masochist don't waste your money, hard earned or not, on renting this movie. It's barely worth your time watching it on the movie channels on which it's currently playing. You're better off renting a copy of the original Stepford Wives that came out 30 years ago. It has about a point and a half higher rating on IMDb at 6.8 and that's only because the 2004 version is obscenely overrated on IMDb with a score of 5.3. By definition 5.3 would be an "average" movie and if this movie is average I'd HATE to see a BAD movie!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake stands as evidence of the consequences of tinkering with a movie's plot when filming has already begun. Wholesale changes were made, apparently, and the resultant film is something of a mess. Despite this, it shows occasional flashes of the bright satire it might have been.The film opens brightly with a neat credits sequence and an amusing riff on reality TV as hard-hearted TV executive Joanna Eberhart (Nicole Kidman, looking very plain and unglamorous throughout) unveils her station's programmes for the new season. Sacked by her network when a contestant from one of her shows kills his ex-wife as a result of being on the show, Eberhart moves with her husband (Matthew Broderick) to the wealthy town of Stepford, where she slowly discovers that things are not as they should be.Nearly all the laughs in this film are contained in the first fifteen minutes (apart from a great AOL dig near the end), but things become increasingly silly once the action moves to Stepford where all the hot wives wear plastic smiles and occasionally move in perfect synchronicity. It's the lazy male's fantasy made real, and there should be a rich vein of humour for writer Paul Rudnick to mine, but unfortunately his script is flat and uninteresting, and modern day sensibilities simply insists that one of the eventual wives is a gay man (Roger Bannister). Once Stepford's wicked secret starts coming to light, the script plays like a 'serious' horror film without all the horror bits taken out as it abandons its increasingly woeful attempts at humour for an ill-conceived mystery that completely fails to involve the viewer.For a smart, hotshot executive, Eberhart is incredibly slow to fathom out what is going on ? in fact she's so slow she has to be told ? and the promotional film of the town's leader, Mike (Christopher Walken), while an amusing riff on 50s promo films, actually flies in the face of all we have seen before. The Stepford wives aren't robots at all ? even though they double as mobile ATM machines ? but real women who have had chips inserted in their heads after "first, we locate the brain." Ah well, the film has lost all audience goodwill by then, anyway, so it doesn't really matter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To say that there's not a lot to this film is a bit of an understatement. The filmmakers have taken Ira Levin's fairly unsettling original novel and made a conscious decision to make a pretty light-hearted, comedic version. There's nothing wrong with this in theory but the problem is that they seem to have overstepped the mark on this score and have delivered a movie so insubstantial and lacking in tension/darkness that it's highly unlikely to linger at all in your mind after seeing it and little wonder that audiences and critics were severely underwhelmed at the time of the film's release. The starry cast all perform well enough with Roger Bart in particular delivering an engaging comic turn as one of Stepford's gay couple (a feature which, unsurprisingly, did not feature in the novel or the first film version but which actually works quite well here) but the actors are really taking part in something here which is beneath them. That said, the film is never less than watchable and it certainly looks good throughout. The problem is, it's ultimately a rather silly and forgettable affair which, for a big budget, big studio summer event movie, is disappointing to say the least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Visually, 'Stepford' literally shrieks from the screen, presenting an extremely intense, oversaturated colour palette. It's hard to tell whether the transfer is too red or if it's representative of the original print. Generally, however, a very good picture. There's not much more to say about 'The Stepford Wives'. Discussing the movie with a friend, she said that if she was heavily hung-over, unable to move from the sofa and turned on the TV to find that there was absolutely nothing else on except the film, she would watch it. I wouldn't go this far.The Commentary by Frank Oz is conversational and informative. Oz is an engaging speaker, rather more involving than the film itself, and reveals that he shot, at great expense, an entirely different beginning featuring hordes of marching, Prada-clad women that proved wrong for the film (it's odd that this isn't included in the deleted scenes). He explains why several comedic sequences were cut in order to drive the story forward and provides a very comprehensive (and extremely complementary) overview of the different crew and cast members who helped make the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the actors, so it pains me to write this. And I may be a doctor, but I'm also a cinephile - and I can enjoy films with terrible scientific blunders, but this is just waaaayyy too over the top. The whole "nano" thing was very clever - but it looked like they took the original film, wrote a new screenplay about nanochips rather than robotics, took some large scissors, cut up each screenplay, shuffled to get random plot facts, and taped it all together.I mean REALLY! How is it that a human female with nanochips in her brain can function as an ATM machine? In the original film, the wives were killed and replaced by robots. In this one, there is a scene where Joanna, in the original film, sees the robot that will replace here ? it's very scary. In this film, Joanna sees the same thing ? but they AREN'T robots! So it doesn't make sense! And I can tell you with absolute authority that there is no place in the human respiratory or gastrointestinal systems that allow for ATM functioning. And I don't know how you could put a magnetic strip reader and rollers in a person's mouth to read an ATM cared and dispense cash.So the film sets it up as the original ? they appear to be robots. Then Joanna sees her replacement body ? but they are NOT replaced ? there are nanochips in their brains instead! This is such a bizarre plot gap I can't fathom why it was set up that way.The actors were fun to watch and there is some good humor ? particularly the first few minutes of the film. Just watch the first 10 minutes and then fast forward through the rest. You'll fully comprehend the film</fullReview>

Equally bad is Bette Midler who is totally unfunny comic relief. Matthew Broderick as Nicole's husband also looks totally confused as if he wonders what he's doing in this piece of trash. Another totally needless remake in Hollywood's continued recycling of rotten trash. Hollywood -- get a clue! This movie is as embarrassingly bad as in inferior TV sitcom episode.

		<fullReview>Powerful TV executive Joanna Eberhart (Nicole Kidman) has a complete nervous breakdown over a tragedy she inadvertently caused. Her husband moves the whole family to the town of Stepford--a quiet little town where Joanna can recover. Joanna notices something strange about the town--all the women LOVE doing housework and cooking, look perfect at all times, are ALWAYS happy and do anything for their husbands. Slowly Joanna realizes something is terribly wrong...and this is a comedy! This remake of the 1975 horror movie takes the plot and (almost) the entire screenplay and turns it into a comedy. The making of this movie (I heard) was a nightmare. Cast member Bette Midler had screaming arguments with director Frank Oz, there were numerous rewrites, there were (at one point) FIVE different endings and other cast members hated the changes made in mid production. Preview audiences hated what the saw and the whole movie was overhauled--many subplots were deleted and the ending was changed! I expected the worst but--it's not too bad.The beginning was dreadful--it was a very unfunny bit about a reality show gone wrong with people being killed. Homicide is not funny. It really picked up when they moved to Stepford. That's when it actually got pretty funny. There were plenty of stupid jokes but the good ones more than made up for them--the introduction of Robo Rover 3000 was VERY funny. It does fall apart at the end but it was still pretty good.The acting--Kidman is just great--she handles the comedy and drama very well; Matthew Broderick (all grown up) was OK as her husband; Bette Midler was hysterical as a very crude neighbor and Glenn Close was just wonderful as the VERY sweet wife of the mayor. Christopher Walken however was DREADFUL as the mayor--but there may have been a reason for that.Not bad but no great shakes. The major problem is the obvious cutting and a bad ending. The infighting couldn't have helped either. Worth seeing--but don't go out of your way.</fullReview>

It was so horribly dull i came extremely close to getting up and walking out of the theater, never to return. This for me is extraordinarily rare you see, as i intend to sit through ever single movie i pay for. I've sat through so many terrible movies, but not one compelled me so much to want to leave. Even the time i got a bloody nose during "From Justin to Kelly" didn't make me leave. The biggest problem of this movie wasn't that it was simply bad, it wasn't really. It was just dull and stupid. And in a way, its not complete suckiness made it harder to sit through. Worse movies are more fun to sit through. Darkness, which is a far worse movie, hands down, was much more fun to attend. I can laugh at a super bad movie. This movie was just so dull, it sucked the humor out of my veins, my brain. It was just so DULL! If you want to watch bad movies and laugh, stay away.

		<fullReview>For the record, I never saw the original.Plot: .6/2: Joanna Eberhart (Kidman) has had a nervous breakdown. She was a major TV executive until one of the participants on her show (White) gets screwed over and loses his wife in the game and tries to kill both his wife and Joanna. This gets Joanna fired. So her husband Walter Fresby (Broderick) quits his job and gets his family to move to Stepford, a town in Connecticut, to get away from it all. When they arrive, Joanna realizes this place is nothing normal. The whole town is full of women who are apparently perfect. They all have blond hair, do all the housework and have screaming orgasms. All the men go away to the Men's Club on a regular schedule, where they have a meeting hosted by Mike Wellington (Walken), apparently the town leader. Joanna, along with Jewish novelist Bobbie Markowitz (Midler) and flamboyant homosexual Roger Bannister (Bart), apparently the only other normal wives (or in Roger's case, bitches), sets out to figure out what the secret is behind Stepford's closed doors.If you don't know what is wrong with them, you have been hiding in a hole since the '70s. Since everyone knows what the Stepford wives are, there is no shock factor involved in this movie. They told you in the goddamn trailer what was happening. Since it is a remake, none of the plot is surprising, besides one slight twist that might not be completely what Stepford newbies may expect. The problem is that there are about 50 plot holes all over the place. Are the women robots or have they been programmed. It obviously says they are programmed, but there are many instances where it clearly shows them as robots. The ending makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. In fact, most of the movie is nonsensical. If this were an original, I'd be lenient. This is, however, a remake, so I would expect them to build on the original, not make it crappier.Comedy: .7/2: Any comedy in this movie is just a zinger here or there. Granted, those are some good zingers ("I worked at AOL" "Is that why the women are so slow?"), but it rarely ventures outside of that. There are some easy gay jokes involving Roger, some funny Jewish jokes involving Bobbie and a great cameo by Mike White, but it's not enough, and they could have spent much more time making fun of the Stepfordians while instead they tried run of the mill jokes.Suspense: .3/2: Since it is a remake of a movie that coined an almost Dictionary worthy term, there is little suspense left available, probably the reason they went for the comedy angle. They do squeeze a little bit of suspense here and there, but most of it is just too silly to take seriously.Acting: 1.3/2: Oh, the acting is average. Kidman (Eyes Wide Shut) is OK, Broderick (Ferris Bueller's Day Off) is mediocre, Midler (Get Shorty) is good, Bart (the upcoming The Producers) is stereotypical but good, Close (Air Force One) and Walken (The Rundown) are good, but wasted, Lovitz (SNL) is a great choice, but wasted and Mike White is great in his short role. It could have been worse.Entertainment: .5/2: For all the crappy plot, all the crappy zingers and all the crappy suspense, The Stepford Wives could have been worse. It needed to be a lot better, however. It's too silly to take seriously, to dark to be funny.Total: 44%: As I said above, The Stepford Wives is too silly to be suspenseful and too dark to be silly. It has one of the biggest plot holes in recent memories. It could have been good, but it just didn't try hard enough. It was directed by Yoda. That's pretty funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit, I am not a fan of "campy" movies. My wife wanted to see this one, so we rented the DVD. Man, is it bad. The acting by Nicole Kidman was very much over the top. We all know she is capable of exceptional acting, so this had to be the direction. Matthew Broderick was so unaffected, that I thought his performance was going to cause narcolepsy.The plot is simple-minded. The direction is awful. This tries to have a sci-fi twist to it, but they got that wrong as well. It is so far removed from anything close to reality, that the movie is more in the fairy tale genre than sci-fi. I can suspend disbelief, but there are limits. C'mon.The deleted scenes on the DVD reveal that their was some notion of going way, way over the top with characters spontaneously developing long reaching mechanical arms and lawn-mowing attachments. This is in direct conflict of the premise that something is being done to these (human) women. It's good that they removed those scenes, but some of the remaining scenes suggest that these are robots, not humans. It's all a real mess.This is total garbage and a total waste of my time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Oz's recent take on the remake( or "adaptation" ?) of The Stepford Wives from the 70's does not offer single reason why the task was completed. The comical effort is rather lazy and there is no use for the word thriller really (which actually has been used in description). The talented cast(Nicole Kidman, Christopher Walken, Better Midler...) seems to work just to get the paycheck in the end and every character seems to be (literally) on auto-drive and the movie is in the end just the same mess of loose strands that it was in the beginning. Even the critical aspects do not hit their target like the maybe should and were meant. This would actually earn only 2 stars but on the other hand Oz's previous work does include Bowfinger (maybe it was Steve Martin's script but anyway) AND the set houses and decoration were chic.</fullReview>

Bear in mind, for someone who hasn't see the original, that the movie belongs to a past decade's science fiction. The great performances of Bette Midler and Nicole Kidman, give the whole movie a fresh air. Sure all the cast has something to give and you come to the conclusion that you had spent enjoyably 88 minutes of your life, and you feel happy for that. Last but not least, stop this prejudice for commercial films. I had a great time and watching this "so-original-American-family" comedy gave me great time.

One thing is certain though, no one who creates DVD-rips of trash like this should feel guilty anymore that they might be causing loss of revenue for big screen film productions - (un)fortunately, and for the sake of the still existing non-brain dead movie-goers Hollywood is seeing to this itself.

It's hard to criticize someone's acting when playing in a film like this, since most of the roles were played tongue-in-cheek over-the-top.If you don't think Nicole Kidman can act, just check her work in "Dead Calm", or "Far and Away", or "Days of Thunder". She looks good, as always, and as someone else said, is quite lovely with dark hair. Glenn Close and Bette Midler played their parts in much the same way, and most people seem to think they can act. And the ending tells us we have definitely reached a post-feminist era. Don't waste your time on this one.</fullReview>

The men are mostly male chauvinists who want their wives to wait on them hand and foot. The women come across as shrill and unhappy. Bette Midler and Nicole Kidman are good in their roles, but their characters are simply not interesting or likable. I have never been a Bette Midler because I think she comes across as simply loud and that's what happens in this movie. Kidman's character makes mean spirited reality TV shows (the footage from which is funnier than most of the rest of the film because it actually satirizes reality TV which I hate)before moving to Stepford. Are either of these characters worth rooting for? I don't think so. Matthew Broderick actually comes across best as Kidman's loving husband. Glenn Close and Christopher Walkien are also very good. Faith Hill has some good moments of physical comedy. However, John Lovitz (!) is badly miscast as Midler's (!!) husband. There are some laughs but you know exactly whee this movie is going before it goes there. 5/10 and I think that is generous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented the new "Stepford Wives" movie recently, out of some morbid curiosity - in other words I wondered how bad it really could be, and I found out. I watched it. Well, actually, I fell asleep during the last 15 minutes of it, but my husband told me how it ended. I didn't miss anything.It was a bit funny in scenes at the beginning. Gotta love Glenn Close; ever since "Fatal Attraction" she has shed her good-girl image that seemed sealed in stone with "The Natural" and shown her capacity for being truly scary. She was about the only refreshing part of the film.The opening credits made it obvious that the film was going to be an out-and-out comedy, unlike the original, which was more of a campy horror/thriller movie. The remake is extremely heavy-handed in both style and dialogue, with no subtle suspense or buildup of any kind.My main beef with the original "Stepford Wives" has always been that if the women were supposed to be the men's fantasy wives, why are they all dressed like Betty Crocker? Men have all kinds of fantasies, and I for one have never met a man who is turned on by a woman wearing a granny-type nightgown dress. It seems that Stepford would be brimming with wives dressed as everything from Catholic Schoolgirls to mistresses of S &amp; M. I could understand if it were to keep up a public front, but even in their own homes they are dressed in these goofy outfits. The same went for the remake. What man finds that look appealing? Bette Midler in the Paul Prentiss role was her usual heavy-handed self, playing Bette Midler; Matthew Broderick is about as menacing as a puppy. Christopher Walken is creepy in the Patrick O'Neal role, but never with the same subtle and sexy menace. Singer Faith Hill, in a bit part, is very effective as a Stepford Wife. Not that it required any effort on her part, about as much effort as it took Ahhhnold to portray an android in "The Terminator".I kept waiting for Nicole Kidman's forehead to show one iota of expression, but alas she appears to be living happily in the land of regular Botox injections. She seemed determined to try to compensate for her voluntary, expensive paralysis by widening her eyes constantly; a frightening apparition, since her forehead never flinched in tune with the rest of her face. Whatever happened to the Nicole Kidman of such films as "To Die For"? WARNING: SPOILER FOLLOWS! And instead of the women being replaced by robots, the women had computer chips in them. This lead me to wonder how one woman, who was briefly used as an ATM, functioned in that capacity unless she were hollowed out and replaced with machinery first.I'm glad I slept through the last few minutes.</fullReview>

I like the way that the film mentioned that there are no minorities amongst the town people and the only gay couple is "straightened out" if you will. There are some quick one liners about it being in Connecticut and boring but, scarily, this really does reflect the right wing mentality of what married couples are supposed to be. Some of the shot selections were a bit odd or uninteresting and uninspired but it's a commercial film. Anyway, it was fun and I found myself laughing.OVERALL: 6/10. Worth a watch.</fullReview>

The houses are idyllic and the lifestyles are hedonistic. Many of the situations, conversations, mannerisms etc are humorously symbolic of elements of society and stereotypes - men's club, women's reading club, carefully designed look for women in contrast to casual "practical" look for men. It was nice to see gender stereotypes mocked with such good humor. Problems: (1) too many of the characters looked bizarre, especially the husband, whose face was too childlike for my liking; (2) the beginning - very tacky - they should have carried the slightly old-fashioned theme throughout; (3) Nicole probably (well certainly) was not the best choice for the lead - when the threesome were sneaking around houses she was the boring person who makes things less fun - I don't know why BM and that other guy put up with her. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glaring Inconsistencies Sink Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard they were going to remake the 1975 classic, I thought it'd be interesting: Nicole Kidman and Matthew Broderick had the leads, and Glenn Close I assumed would play the level-headed psychologist portrayed by Carol Rossen in the original who tries to help Katharine Ross. Then I heard it was going to be a comedy and Glenn Close had another eccentric role unworthy of her talents. The film is mercifully about 20 minutes shorter (script issues?) than the original and the last 20 minutes are ludicrous. It appears there may have been tampering with the editing after the first test-showing, causing inane plot developments. If the women are indeed human (with electrodes in their brains) how can a character spout ATM bills? How can the Midler character not feel the stove flame burning her hand? In a final confrontation, Kidman stands by her robotic replica as they descend to the dungeon (but the women were supposed to be real with electrodes in them)! In the last scene poor Close is actually cuddling a HEAD. The story stands much better as a horror-mystery thriller so see the original Ross, Paul Prentiss classic. While leisurely, it builds to an unforgettable final sequence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not like this movie at all after the first half. They first introduce this movie portraying these women that are "unusually" devoted to their husbands and house chores. They really show the Martha Stuart super amazing housewife. Then they show that these women are malfunctioning and seem to be robots... you can even see sparks and they work as ATMs and what not. How come toward the end they are human. This is incredibly stupid. I would have rather they show that these women were all dead and replaced by these robots. It was an excellent movie right up until the moment they decided to change the storyline. In that sense it is completely ridiculous. I will never watch this movie again... not even with a friend who rented the DVD... It's atrocious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not have high expectations of this (or of any) remake. This cleverly avoids the common pitfalls by having it's tongue very firmly in it's cheek.It is very self consciously clever and really pushes the 1950's kitsch possibilities for stylistic and comic effects while maintaining a contemporary/near future feeling. Glenn Close and Nicole Kidman played well and unexpectedly against "type" giving a nicely unsettled feeling that allowed the (few) moments of real tension to work. Great cast and well directed (only very few times did I feel that scenes were allowed to drift on a little too long.The plot of course, requires a willing suspension of disbelief because it is too full of holes to be taken seriously, but then that was never the point. This is a piece of stylish entertainment with few nuggets of original thought waiting to be mined.See it and enjoy!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I understand from other comments that there are two versions of this remake.In the one that I did not see, the ending apparently discloses that the wives are robots and not merely lobotomized/microchip modified. Apparently that ending did not play well with test audiences and the result was the microchip ending. Failing to edit out the sparks emitting from Faith Hill's ears and the ATM scene suggests an abandonment of any intention to make a meaningful film. This must have been pushed out the door with the primary goal of recouping costs. As the credits rolled, I expected to see that this was a film by Alan Smithee. The basic concept was to remake a Sci-Fi / Thriller / Mystery film in a different genre (Comedy / Drama / Thriller). This film is interesting from the perspective of film industry analysis of the desperate efforts Hollywood takes when an expensive project fails to meet high expectations. Perhaps the DVD will make some sense out of this mess.</fullReview>

In general, I'm not fun of remakes, because original is always original, number one, but this movie has some qualities on it's own, and that's why it should be watched in that way. Maybe it's the best for everyone who attends to watch this m movie not to read Ira Levin's book, or not to watch any movie based on it.

		<fullReview>What can I say about this total disaster of a movie? Perhaps this first sentence is enough in itself, because this film really is not good.It almost gets there at times for comedy as there are some genuinely funny moments, and at times it could seem to be bordering on the sinister atmosphere that was in the original film, yet it just misses that too.I think this movie doesn't work because a) Nicole Kidman's character at the start is totally dislikeable with no redeeming qualities, almost to the point that you wish the guy shot her then, to save you from the rest of the movie, and b)the technology aspect is totally stupid.OK, SPOILER COMING!When the wife accepts an ATM card in her mouth and then spews out notes from said mouth, the movie is completely lost from that moment on because it is just too incredible and ludicrous a thing to happen.And then there is the supposed transformation of the Nicole's character into a stepford wife and the contrived and stupidly asinine ending where Matthew Broderick's character wasn't one of the controlling nerd husbands after all and was uncovering the evil plot - oh puh-leeze, give it up already!Mental note to the production companies involved - if your star chooses to attend the Tony awards instead of the star studded first screening of her own movie, then you have a bomb on your hands and it's gonna blow up in your faces.Please anyone considering seeing or renting this movie - get the original, it's dated, but the movie works so much better than this slack-handed remake!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some good lines, but not as good as it could have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had some good lines and good acting by many of the cast members. The remake pales in comparison with the original. The remake is a lot more cynical than the original and seems to be in some ways farther away from the sexual revolution and the women's movement that the first one seemed to highlight. Kind of like Dr. Strangelove and How I Learned to Love the Bomb being rewritten so that President George W. Bush stops all the WMD from being dropped and kicks Saddam Hussein's butt to boot. The major character played by Nicole Kidman seems to be a lot less easy to empathize with than the character from the original.There were good lines though and I did find this worth the price of a ticket to see some of these actors in form. Seeing pop singer Faith Hill act and doing a good job is also a pleasure after seeing various other pop singers fall on their behinds so to speak with respect to showing that they can play any character with more depth than you find in a three minute video.</fullReview>

The story, yes, is very entertaining and well thought of. But the amazing gaps in the storyline are inexcusable and horrendous. Let me get one thing straight. The "Stepford wives" are the same people, except with computer chips placed on their brains to make them do whatever their husband so wants them to do. That does not mean they are robots. However, at will, the husbands can turn them into an ATM or their own personal slave. I don't understand. Supposedly, "Mike" was a "Stepford husband" (a plot twist I saw a mile away), yet when he got his head knocked off (again, not original), he was clearly a machine. Explain. I do not know what they were going for then. The end, my God, was ridiculous. She kisses him and is electrocuted? Give me a break. I don't even know what to think about this movie. I liked it, sure, but I couldn't help but find all the gaps and misconceptions in the movie. Nicole Kidman was ridiculously good in this movie, as always. Bette Midler had a wonderful performance along with Glenn Close. How can a story this good with a cast so powerful be such a terrible movie? I don't understand.

Yea well there are twists in the film, but frankly its so incredibly stupid that I never believed it going in. Allowing for that fact I decided to see the film because I was told the film was a wonderful satire and that even if I didn't get the horror aspect I'd get the humor.No.Supporting cast aside this movie is awful. The film begins in trouble since the central pair of Broderick and Kidman seem to have been cast from different movies. Kidman is fine but Broderick is still playing Leo Bloom from Broadways Producers. Who's nightmare was it that made that casting happen? It made taking anything after his first appearance impossible to accept on any level.What were they thinking?I can't suggest anyone see this film. If you can accept the idea going in then perhaps you'll like it, but if you're like me and question the sense of why anyone would go to the extreme of robotics then stay away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily The Worst And Most Unnecessary Remake Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its disturbing to note the number of classic '70's films that have had their reputations trashed by 'remakes' - 'The Wicker Man', 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'The Omen', 'Assault On Precinct 13' and now this. Ira Levin's novel was not a laugh-out-loud comedy, and neither was Bryan Forbes' 1975 movie, but this Frank Oz-directed film tries to be - and fails dismally.The screenplay adheres closely to the original story, but over-eggs the pudding with 'funny' one-liners, and a ludicrous 'happy' ending which makes the finale of the 1980 'Revenge Of The Stepford Wives' T.V. movie seem believable by comparison.The story was intended as a darkly humorous comment on the women's lib movement, as the male population of a small American town tries to reverse the tide of feminism by murdering their wives and replacing them with robot doubles, replicas both obedient and beautiful. But the tone of the original has been allowed to leak away; this lumbering travesty has the look and feel of a 1960's sitcom. About the only thing missing is a laugh track.As for the performances, Nicole Kidman is so wooden that when she first appeared I thought she had already been 'replaced'. Bette Midler, is as always, terrible. Glenn Close, Christopher Walken and Matthew Broderick could have phoned in their performances.The exact nature of the duplications is confused - are the women being replaced by robots, or simply brainwashed? For most of the picture, it appears to be the former, but when Broderick shuts down the control centre at the climax, the wives regain their personalities, suggesting the latter. What a cop-out.I have heard complaints that the 1975 movie was 'cheesy'. Well, let me put the record straight. Fashions, hairstyles, technology etc. may have changed dramatically since the 70's, but the fact remains that Bryan Forbes' movie is a far better picture than this one. William Goldman's script did not insult the intelligence of the audience, and Katherine Ross and Paula Prentiss outclass Kidman and Midler. On the cheeseometer, the remake registers as pure Stilton.I wonder which sci-fi classic will be next in line for the same treatment. John Frankenheimer's 'Seconds'? Will the remake end with 'Tony Wilson' ( the Rock Hudson character in the original ) cracking lame gags as a Company doctor drills his skull?</fullReview>

It makes you wonder, at any stage of production, do those involved actually sit down and think to themselves 'this is the biggest pile of trash I've ever helped create?' because someone needs to be told.

I suppose the Disneyesque music is a big clue to the tone of this film. The actors are, as you'd expect, competent. A comedy version? I suppose it's in keeping with a post-feminist reworking of more 'serious' work, but then it really should be a lot funnier than this simple pastiche.

		<shortDescription>A chance wasted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a chance wasted is this movie! Did you read the book by Ira Levin? A very nice book. Unlike the movie, it leaves possibilities open: are the women robots or they just get used to "what an ordinary life means"? By the way, isn't this more terrifying in a way? It is very easy to explain everything very straightforwardly: this guy is a devil, shame on him! ... and now everything will be OK again, we know who's guilty.I will tell you a story: man and wife move to town where everything seems to be just perfect. Everybody happy. But slowly they see that behind this happiness there is something strange: this happiness is just too perfect to be real. Real one is a bit sad, too, even if this sounds strangely. It isn't that "cool". The presented happiness is the one without ANY feeling, just the happiness like by produced by some machine. She didn't like this way of being happy, and of course she didn't. Who would? Well, maybe the man, since a PART of this happiness is that wives are sort of slaves to their husbands, which the men would like after all. But the women seem to be happy about this, too. And you may ask: is this OK or not? ... a lot of questions arises, you may try your own ones.Slowly we are led to the point of the story: the woman becomes the same as the others. So what? Is there somebody who changes the wives into some strange kind of robots, whatever this means? Or she just merged into the society? Isn't this the problem of all of us, after all? Every of us probably told to him/herself once: I will NOT be like them (when I grow up, when I do the same job, when I move to this part of town...). But we did, probably? At this point the story ends. No explanation, you may say.Are you interested in such kind of a story? Well, read the book, since nothing of it the movie offers. In the movie everything is clear: there is somebody changing the women into robots just to make men lazing their lives comfortably. The laboratory is shown, men has remote controls in their pockets. Even more, the reason is told: every one of these women has been once a successful director, manager, a.s.o. And... finally everything is explained plainly, and all the men meet in the shopping center forced to do the shopping.Oh my god, how flat story has been made from a three dimensional book full of interesting questions!</fullReview>

Wouldn't you? Yes. Otherwise, what's the point of having the talented Glenn Close, Chris Walken, Matt Broderick and Bette Midler on board? None. Sadly, it is not to be for the Stepford Wives. And the only person who seems to fit into this disjointed miasma is Nicole Kidman.

		<shortDescription>disastrous remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For its 21 Century movie incarnation, Ira Levin's classic feminist thriller "The Stepford Wives" has been re-imagined as a feel-good, slapstick comedy - a shift in tone that is, to put it mildly, a complete disaster for this story. Bryan Forbes' wonderful 1975 movie version (starring Katherine Ross) included many comic scenes as well, but there the humor was pointed and dark, and provided a perfect counterpoint to the sinister thriller elements at the story's core. In this "new and improved," ever-so-sunny edition of the Levin work, written by Paul Rudnick and directed by Frank Oz, the whole thing is played for laughs from the get-go, instantly robbing the story of its edge and diluting its delicious social commentary about a society in which women have literally become mindless robots responding to the commands of their misogynist husbands. All we're left with, in the end, is a really bad, over-the-top comedy that wastes the talents of Nicole Kidman, Matthew Broderick, Glenn Close, Christopher Walken and Bette Midler and that tarnishes the memory of a good movie into the bargain.A pixie-haired Kidman plays Joanna Eberhart, a driven TV network executive who is fired when one of the man-hating programs she produces goes terribly awry. Determined to become a more supportive wife and engaged mother, she allows her husband to cart the family off to a gated, crime-free, all-white, politically conservative (though, somehow, a gay couple is allowed to slip through) community in Connecticut known as Stepford, a 1950's throwback where all the wives are perfect little Susy Homemakers who dress in poofy, pastel-colored gingham dresses, maintain spotlessly clean and flawlessly decorated homes, smile constantly, and dutifully cater to each and every one of their husbands' whims and wishes. Even though Joanna intends to make every effort to become the ideal wife that her understanding husband wants her to be, she soon begins to suspect that there may be a dark secret lurking beneath the impossibly perky dispositions of all the women in town.Although the plot here is virtually the same as it was in the 1975 film, this "Stepford Wives" has taken the entirely wrong approach to the Levin material. Part of what made the earlier version so much fun was that we learned right along with Ross what was actually taking place in the town. Her slow awakening to the truth was what provided the suspense so essential to making the tale frightening and compelling. Here, however, the women are such ridiculous space cadets from the outset that any newcomer would have to be a complete idiot not to figure it all out the moment she hit town. Moreover, as a comedy, the film falls miserably flat, going for the cheap and easy laugh at every opportunity. And, of course, the movie lacks the courage to carry through with the earlier film's downbeat, defeatist ending, opting instead for an upbeat and "clever" surprise-twist finale that shows just how far film-making has fallen over the past 30 years. (It also makes absolutely no sense in light of the scene where Midler puts her hand directly into the flame of a gas stove and suffers no burn - but then who expects coherence and consistency from a film this badly written and thought out?). The irony is that the first version, while retaining the thriller elements of the story, was far more humorous and far more effective as a satire than this limp little remake could ever possibly hope to be.Perhaps, after this movie and "Bewitched," Ms. Kidman should avoid appearing in any more comedies - or at least any more comedies based on decades-old cultural artifacts - for the foreseeable future.This dreadful, ill-fated version of "The Stepford Wives" leaves us with just one basic question: if you're not going to do a remake properly, why do it at all?</fullReview>

Somebody told me a couple days ago that they had more respect for Kidman then they did for Cruise and i said well give Cruise this, "he wasn't in Stepford Wives". This should end Middler's film career, that's about the best thing I can say about Stepford wives. The worst thing I can say is the worst thing I can say about any movie and that is this "considering the people involved this might be the worst movie that I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>shallow social commentary wrapped in an unfunny SF comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you make an idea-movie, which should also act as a social commentary on the contemporary society, then you must be prepared to put an edge in it. To take chances. To go against mainstream. It's risky, but it pays off if you do it right.The "Stepford wives" starts on the right note, but soon enough it's apparent that the director Frank Oz chose to play it safe. The final result looks more like something that was scheduled to appear in Marvel comics, but somehow got turned into a new big-budget Nicole Kidman flick.Just look at the basics of the plot: insecure husbands turn their successful wives into robots. This operation consists of (not actually seen in the movie) removing the brains from the wives, putting them in robot bodies, AND mind-controlling those brains. What I want to know is this - WHY NOT JUST BUILD A ROBOT WIFE AND BE DONE WITH IT?!? Why this whole "brain-removing" part? Yes, yes, I know, it's a - *wink* *wink* - social commentary. Yeah, right. So is Tomb Raider.To sum up in one sentence - if you put the gaping plot holes and ridiculous storyline aside, what you get is a light comedy with a moderately good cast, a few little laughs and a horrible please-the-audience ending.To be sincere, this movie left a bad taste in my mouth. I expected it to be much more intelligent. After the showing I felt like somebody suckered me into seeing a Pokemon movie. If I had to rate this flick, I'd give it 4 out of 10, but only because the average quality of recent Hollywood movies is so bad it wouldn't be fair to go any lower.Don't rent this. Watch it on TV, and only if nothing else is on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was sorely disappointed by this remake, as I am of many of them. To try and create this as something it's not and never was meant to be was a HUGE FLOP. It would have been better off if they left it alone and kept the original ending and intent.The thing that saves it at all, as others have commented I am certain, is the character portrayed by Bette Midler and the homosexual couple. Other than that, a total waste of Hollywood dollars. I want to rent the original now to get the bad taste out of my mouth! What a waste of Walken, Close, and Midler not to mention lovely sets and an original idea that could have been an interesting remake. Happy, sticky, backward ending ruins the whole thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My whole family liked this film. It is, basically, a horror film with some comedic relief--and the film doesn't take itself too seriously (few horror films can). Granted, it isn't Hitchcock, who is more suspense than horror anyway, right? Now, I didn't see the original. Is that a prerequisite? And it is possible that it is more a horror film for women than men. I saw "Sleepy Hollow" twice and I got tired of the heads rolling. I liked that film too but it was not creepy. This film has creepiness and that is a good thing. Hey, I'd watch it again because the sets and the people (women) are so good looking. And who wouldn't like the cast? My teen daughter was pleasantly amused by some of the characters. . but also found it suspense/creepy and weird/creepy. I say, "Enjoy".</fullReview>

After seeing the movie, i read the book. MUCH better. Not seeing the first STEPFORD WIVES film, i was very surprised at the end. When Glenn Close's character, Claire, confessed robots was her idea. The only thing that annoyed me about the movie was the sex scene. When the three of them sneak into the one woman's house and they hear...orgasmic...sounds coming from upstairs.

Unfortunately, this is exactly what this awful movie relies on to move itself along. Plot holes big enough to shove the whole town of Stepford through abound, and when all was said and done I actual left the theater feeling utterly bored and wondering if I just watched a bad made-for-TV sitcom. The movie just rushes itself along, hoping you won't ask any questions or wonder just how the heck certain parts happened (the actual Stepford-ing process being foremost in my mind), which anyone with an IQ over 30 is going to have, and the ending is so appallingly lame and saccharine that you could only wish it ended at the same point as the original version did (which would be about 29 years ago). To summarize my opinions on this film: "bleh".</fullReview>

And you would think that with the heavy hitters in the cast that they could have saved this. NOT!!! I have seen my share of dark comedies from 'Arsenic and Old Lace' to the present. In those movies you knew when it was supposed to be funny. Sitting in this packed audience, you could tell no one was sure if something was supposed to be viewed as being funny or not. For a book that bordered on suspense/science fiction...this movie turned it upside down and into something that only resembled the book and the 1st movie by the name and the robot-like women. I heard enough grumbling as I walked out the theater to know that just about everyone thought this was a BAD movie and not worth the price of the movie ticket or gas to get there. Go see 'Garfield'...it is more intellectually appealing than this mess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't add to the growing chorus of 'boos' garnered by this godawful remake, except to say that I hate movies based on faulty logic.Without sounding like an economics professor: would the husbands of Stepford really want their wives to abandon their high-paying jobs to become domestic slaves/robots/micro-chip-implanted domestic divas? In a pivotal scene, Nicole Kidman's character discovers that one of the local zombified Stepford women used to be a prominent judge. Bette Midler's character, meanwhile, is supposed to be a best-selling author. Judges and best-seller authors generally make decent salaries.Now, unless the men of Stepford are all multi-millionaires, would they really be willing to so readily sacrifice their wives' earning potential, just so they could enjoy the comforts of robotic domestic divas? More to the point, could anyone besides Donald Trump actually afford to live in Stepford if they didn't come from a high-earning double-income family? In the 1950s era (which this film is allegedly sending up) it was possible to get by with The Man as sole breadwinner, but methinks such days are long gone, except in ultra-rich communities.Just one of the many, many, many flaws in this terrible turkey.Nate H.

It very beautifully portrays what this story was originally meant to be- pure, campy entertainment. The roles are wonderfully acted and the storyline is just off enough that you know what you're watching is supposed to make you laugh. I thoroughly enjoyed this film from start to finish. Glenn Close gives a particularly entertaining performance and this group of 3( characters of Nicole, Bette and Roger) is one I'd like to hang out with.

Something to watch on a rainy Tuesday afternoon if you have a flu, broken phone and enough potato chips to eat crazy.Yet, it could have been a great movie if Frank Oz had put a little more work in it and had not tried to turn the original movie into a comedy with an IQ requirement "80 max". A bit more drama and horror and a lot less Midler, Lovitz and gay jokes.After all, the main idea is great. Curse the person who had the idea of putting a drop of Police Academy into it.Nicole Kidman plays well as always, rest of the cast is a little disappointing (and, again, cut out Lovitz and Midler!). It is bizarre how the woman who played in a Trier movie ended just a year later in something like that. Did she forget to read the whole script before saying yes? Finally, did Frank Oz write it in a bus? The plot holes drive just mad. It would be nice if next time he read the script through BEFORE he starts making the movie. The result might be a lot less puzzling.</fullReview>

It could have been the writing it could have been the fact that these two people did not really like each other. Also can someone tell me the point of having the children in the story? They were simply sent away to camp or whatever and that was the end of them. On the positive side i did enjoy when Bette Midler's character said about the children, " they grow up so fast,think i will have 3 more". I also quite liked the gay people too, but don't actually think that they were very likely people to be accepted to a place like this. No black people, no Asian people, stay at home mums so probably no gay people either.</fullReview>

In the original the tension and mystery builds and you feel sympathy for Katherine Ross you also are kept guessing much longer. I have to say that having seen the original I couldn't wait for Nicole Kidman to get her comeuppance. The tension never builds and the mystery is short lived. I watched this film with someone who had never seen the original and they had guessed what was going on within the first 15 minutes, therefore the rest of the film played out like a limp damp rag. The best lines and performances are by Bette and Bart and if you don't mind ignoring much of the rest of the film then just watch it for their performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A SOLID comedy inspired from a FIRST rate Suspense thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First and foremost, if you have seen the original film, DO NOT go to this movie expecting to see a "remake" of a classic. Many people argue and deride the current trend of remaking original films that work fine as they are. However if a director quite honestly thinks he can bring something NEW to the original idea and perhaps update the work and bring it to a new audience (i.e. younger viewers) I say HAVE AT IT! It is in THIS spirit that I think Frank Oz successfully achieved his goal. This is a WONDERFUL Comedy that functions ON ITS OWN, even if you have NOT seen the original movie. In case you were unaware (as some of my co-workers were) The original movie debuted in 1975 based on a book by Ira Levin (the author of Rosemary's Baby) The movie was a chilling look at men's and womens role's with a wonderful twist on the suspense horror genre in that the majority of the movie takes place in bright sunshine. The biggest argument I have read in critiques of this current 2004 version of the film, is when it is compared with its' predecessor. This is a flawed argument however. Frank Oz was not ATTEMPTING to do a faithful remake of the original. To be quite blunt without giving spoilers of plot detail, the original movie WOULD NOT WORK as a horror/suspense movie today; its plot and subtext are not only cliché at this point, but too many people in society HAVE seen the original and all twist and reveals of the original would already be familiar to them. It would be like someone remaking "The Sixth Sense" several years from now. This would be largely ineffective since a LARGE portion of the theater going public HAVE seen this film and Do know its basic plot twist.Instead, Frank Oz brings to us a NEW Stepford, which is not only campy by todays societal standards, but Capitalizes on said campiness by becoming in itself a parody of men's and women's roles. The movie has been updated for the 2000s by including a gay couple, and some other small devices. Yes the basic plot is there, but the true gem is the writing. This movie has some WONDERFUL dialogue. I saw the film in a full theater and to be honest I missed several lines because the audience was laughing so hard!The costumes and sets where sumptuous, with GREAT attention to detail. There is humor and foreshadowing all over the place in subtle places. Pay attention to the Symbol of the Mens club on the sign. Look at the roadsigns facing camera as the couple is driving into Stepford. This movie plays VERY well to a family audience. It is rated PG13 which I though appropriate. About the ONLY thing which I thought parents would find objectionable to younger children was a small scene in which two people are heard having sex off-camera. In summary, this is a VERY fine Dark Comedy. I don't think its quite a black comedy like say, "War of the Roses" but more of a campy comedy like "Death Becomes Her". If you go to see a New spin (with new twists) of an original classic, and you go with an open mind, I think you will find a wonderfully fun (if not too serious) motion picture.</fullReview>

Sure it's Frank Oz (and i love Frank Oz), but the preview seemed to tell a lot about the movie, and I was afraid nothing new would come out of this.But once I saw the first 15 minutes of that movie, I knew this was no failure. Nicole Kidman is brilliant, and from her first appearance in the movie, you know it's not one of her regular parts. Matthew Broderick is a very good surprise, I didn't know he could be so good.Bette Miller may not have a very big part, but she's hilarious. And Glenn Close is perfect. As for Christopher Walken, well let's just say that he proves once more that he can play anything. Now I know some didn't like the movie and will always find something to say about it but speaking for myself and the two friends who came to see it with me (and the whole theater as a matter of fact), we couldn't stop laughing. Sure, like I said, the preview may look like it's telling too much, but only a tenth of the movie is actually shown in it. That film is full of surprises and laughs. So my advice is: don't read the critics, just see it, you may just be surprised how much you loved it. The not-so-silent Bob</fullReview>

Kidman needs to sit down and have a good long think about making any more dreadful re-makes. My dedication to film kept me watching, but it wasn't much fun, if any at all. Matthrew Broderick was his usual self, sleep walking through the film, and the usually-malevolent Christopher Walken looks embarrassed to be involved. One can only question how and why 'the King of New York' has lost his way so badly. But my gravest criticism has to be levelled at Nicole Kidman. I'm sure I've seen her act, and I'm sure once upon a time she conveyed an emotion to be through the medium of film. But I can't now remember when. She's just not funny. At all. She surely was well paid though, which, it seems, is her priority.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK so maybe some things don't add up or make sense, but you cant deny this movie is a riot. Nicole Kidman is a self absorbed TV big shot who gets fired for bad judgement on TV programming that leads to a crazy little scene at a showing for TV execs. Kidman and family then decide to movie to the burbs for a some piece and quiet and get more than they bargained for when they arrive in Stepford. The Divine Miss "M" plays a writer whose forced by court order to move to stepford with family but we are warned by her "Dont ask". The pharmacy guy romancing Brie on Desperate Housewives plays a guy whose hubby has brought him to the open minded Stepford for a "Change" as well. The three become fast friends and soon learn that Stepford has sinister secrets. Glen Close gives a fine performance as one of the loony wives of the town along with Faith Hill who has one of the funniest scenes early on when she "Malfunctions" at a square dance". There are funny one liners and banter back and forth from the cast and I laughed out loud and generally had a great time watching this film. It entertained me and thats all I was looking for. Although the part that doesn't make sense which has to do with the question the film makes you ponder at the very end "are they robotic or human, or are they the six million dollar women". Watching the deleted scenes involving Faith and Bette really make you say "hugh"...only because of how the movie ends with regards to the fate of the wives....you'll see what I mean. Incedently that scene with Bette should have been left in. It was hilarious. Thankfully its on the DVD. Have fun watching this wickedly funny take on the original and ignore the elephant in the room.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny Comedy, With Some Good Moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joanna Eberhart (Nicole Kidman) is a successful woman, presenting a famous show in television. However, after an incident in her show, she is fired and has a nervous breakdown. Her husband Walter Kresby (Matthew Broderick) decides to move with their children and her to Stepford, Connecticut, Massachussets, to a private and fancy compound. The place is wonderful, and the women are very beautiful and perfect housewives, and after a short period living there, Joanna discloses the truth behind such perfection. "The Stepford Wives" is a funny comedy, having a magnificent cast and some good moments. There are many good lines, like for example, when one woman has a "problem" in a party and somebody says: "-She is drunk."; and Bette Midler's character immediately says: "-She is blonde". Or when one of the designers mentions that he worked at AOL, and Joanna says: "-Is that why the women are so slow?". Unfortunately, I have never watched the original adaptation of Ira Levin's book mentioned in many reviews, but anyway I found this 2004 version a good entertainment. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Mulheres Perfeitas" ("Perfect Women")</fullReview>

Why do some people take everything so seriously? I wasn't laughing from start to finish, but there were enough chuckles to make it OK. There were certainly more laughs here than in the much acclaimed "Sideways". Stop over-analyzing and laugh at the jokes. See a movie to have a good time. Nicole Kidman was just fine as the heroine, but the best lines were for Bette Midler. Christopher Walken is always creepy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film sucked. I had missed it as the cinema and was going mad to see it. I work in a video store so when i brought it home to watch it with my mam it was easy to guess I was shocked. What a great cast and what a great load of rubbish.Nicole Kidman is a fine actress. She annoys me sometimes but in general a fantastic actress. Bette Midler can act and is genuinely funny. Matthew Broderick hoped this was his stepping stone back into a leading man actor category...sorry Mr Broderick and Mr Walken now that I think about it..you both suck.I only left it on because I liked Nicole's hair blonde and erm I wanted to see the actual bad ending. Wait til it's on TV cause it is crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stick To The Original Instead (SPOILERS AHEAD!!!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is always a risk whenever Hollywood gets the idea about remaking beloved classics. Either it becomes a rousing success or a spectacular failure. In the past few years, films like "Psycho" and "The Manchurain Candidate" have made movie watchers wish that they've saved they're money and had a lobotomy instead. "The Stepford Wives" is the latest movie on the list. The entire cast (With the exception of Roger Bart, who is the film's saving grace)should have known better and director Frank Oz did such an incredibly bad job on this film that it seems that he treated the moviegoer like a total idiot. There were SOOOOOOO many plot holes! The most obvious of the 2? 1) The wives (and the lone husband)were controlled by chips implanted in their brains, yet almost every scene made it clear that they were robots (The ATM Wife, Midler's hand on the stove, and the Kidman robot).2) Why did none of the men (Or Glenn Close)catch on that Kidman was faking the robot-thing? Every wife/husband had a program file. How could NONE of them notice this? Stick to the far superior, and creepier, original version instead. If you actually DO like this piece of trash, then maybe YOU are a Stepford Wife!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How could you miss with Nicole Kidman, Bette Midler, Matthew Broderick, Glenn Close, and Christopher Walken to pull it off. Apparently you can miss by a mile as the Stepford Wives proves. This tongue-in-cheek remake of the 1975 thriller has nothing to recommend it. The plot, which everyone knows, revolves around the transformation of women who move to Stepford into perfect wifely automotons. This movie adds absolutely nothing to this well known storyline other than adding gay, and canine transformations into the mix. This remake does to itself what the antagonist does in the plot. Takes intelligent and thoughtful material and turns it into inane but pretty blather blather. See the original. 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

The plot was so predictable, the comedy fell flat, the characters where dull especially the men.About 10 minutes into the movie I asked my friend "how long do you think it was before the actors realized how bad this movie was?" I just can't even believe when these high profile actors read this they thought it was a good idea.Do not waste your time or money on this thing.Watch the original and forget that these good actors made this mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THIS MOVIE SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN MADE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Stepford Wives made in 1975 is my all-time favorite movie. So you can just imagine my disappointment at this remake. They made it into a comedy for goodness sakes! The original was a classic horror movie. Why they messed with the formula is beyond me. Were they scared that women in 2004 would not accept the premise of the original? Well the women of 1975 were pretty hip and they accepted the original. The women of 1975 probably figured this was just one guy's vivid imagination and left it at that. No hard feelings. After all they did make Revenge Of The Stepford Wives and The Stepford Husbands. So the women got even. In addition the jokes were lame in this movie. And there was a major inconsistency in the movie to boot. I will say that the special effects were better in this version. But that is about all I can say I liked about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GREAT COMEDY- just don't' take it seriously POSSIBLE SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Too many people reviewing this take the film too seriously- or they went in expecting far too much. I loved the film, however in saying that, it had potential to be a whole lot better.Nicole Kidman's role is pretty bland though, and there's not much she could do with it. Bette Midler is the standout in the film- back in top shape as far as comedy is concerned. Roger Bart is a real discovery in this film- and hopefully he'll be in more comedies in the future. It's nice to see a stereotype in a film after so much political correctness.Having also seen a test screening of the film though, I can reveal Frank oz's original cut was a hell of a lot better than the final cut. There's a thread on the IMDb messageboards were I go into detail on the changes that have been made. The comedy is very Will And Grace, current-events sort of sitcom comedy-a rarity on the big screen. There are some really great jokes (things you can do with a pinecone), parts that amuse (the opening sequence and the reality show satire), and some interesting special effects. However, the new 'Larry King' ending confuses people a lot- as well as the Cartoon bit. These were added after the test screenings, and shouldn't have been. The original ending had the women inside robotic bodies, but there human brains intact. The ending scene has Joanna leaving Stepford, and Bobbie malfunctioning (the 'Goodbye, seeya' bit in the trailer)- and means that there aren't any plot holes in the film.The editing leaves some slow parts in the film, and the movie should have been longer. Frank Oz left out a scene (that will be on the DVD almost definitely), that he'll regret leaving out- and would've livened up the movie so much. In it, Joanna stabs Bobbie (a bit of tension for those who complained the movie wasn't dark enough), she malfunctions and displays her functions- including built in fridge, speakers (head flies off and spins around to demonstrate orgasm), whisk, and lawnmower. All in all though, I thought the movie was great. It had some biting satire, hilarious jokes. I think people are too used to either incredibly witty banter in movies (sort of a cross between Neil Simon, Quentin Tarantino and Jerry Seinfeld) or incredibly stupid gross-out movies- and that's why they couldn't accept this movie.See the Stepford Wives for a good cinema-going experience.</fullReview>

She went back to using her annoying body-language that she was doing in the beginning of her career + deep sighs all the time, shrieks etc. And i'm not sure these were the necessary parts of a role she was playing. I wonder - do even real Kidman/Broderick/etc fans (who watch their idol's movies no matter what) find anything in that movie?score: 3, out of really kindness of heart, 'cause artists of the movie really did big work with make up, costumes, interiors in the houses etc. But other than that it's worthless movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this one the day after it opened in Mt. Barker. I felt the audience was generally scared in the 'Kitchen Scene' with Bette Midler being robotized and being SCARY! The trailer is awesome and you'll here Nicole Kidman say "What have they done to you?!!" in your nightmares.But they did have a major plot hole but forget about it, Glenn Close is simply adoring and has those cold robotic eyes as usual so the part was made for her. Bette Midler takes the cake as Bobbie ('I love you but please die!'). Matthew Boderick was severely out of place here, he was completely unlovable and you wanted to hate him for being in this film.I don't like Nicole Kidman, never ever had, but she was good here and showed genuine sympathy and lose when her two best friends were taken from their lives.A great film, i'll give it 9.5 (-.5 because of the plot hole).

		<fullReview>Everyone involved with this film should be so embarrassed as to never show their faces again. I sat through this piece of drek yesterday afternoon. I am out of town on a business trip and being that we had the entire afternoon free we decided to see a movie. Being that we had seen quite a few of the other films that are currently playing we decided to see this. I had no real desire to see this but went along. Big mistake.I should have scheduled a root canal as that would have to be less painful to sit through than this piece of junk. In one scene they explain that the Stepford wives have chips implanted into their brains yet in another scene one turns into an ATM. ( My vote for dumbest scene of the year so far ) I figure a movie has got to be bad when they cut the scenes from the film that they used in the trailers.Matthew Broddrick continues to prove that he is one of the top 5 most over rated actors in Hollywood. I really couldn't figure out what his character was supposed to be.I suppose women will like this as it is just a man bashing film, but men, do yourselves a favor.

This is not the case here.The only good thing going for it is that it is not a long film.Do not watch this film unless you are a) a retarded 14 year old. b) related to any cast or crew or c) strapped to a chair with your eye-lids forced open like in A Clockwork Orange.I gave it a 3 out of 10 because Walken was in it - otherwise a 2 :(Avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst film I have seen in quite a while</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible SPOILERS. I assume that you know the secret of Stepford.This film is absolutely terrifying, but not because of its central premise and/or subject-matter, but because it really is absolutely terrifyingly and unredeemably bad. One can only wonder how it was possible that a film uniting so many big names (Why, oh why, Christopher Walken?) can really be such a complete mess.To mention the good things first, the Production Designer clearly had a good day and there are about five good one-liners in the whole film, most of which are delivered by Bette Midler. This ends the list of good features.Other than that, the film fails completely. It is not terribly funny and it certainly is not scary. In fact, at the "climactic confrontation" between the heroine and the "baddies" towards the end, there is not one iota of menace coming from them. Also, when the first few hints about what might be at the heart of the town are presented, this is done so bluntly that the answer is immediately obvious.Far worse is the fact that none (and I do mean none) of the characters are emotionally engaging in any shape or form. Nicole Kidman's character is completely unlikeable from the start and only changes minorly when she enters Stepford: namely she looses the little character she had and becomes totally spineless. Matthew Broderick is even worse: He starts pale and shallow and stays that way. And those are the characters that are going through the most intense emotional development of all the people in this film. All the others are caricatures drawn in extremely broad strokes.In short: Avoid!</fullReview>

This movie is absolutely nothing and I am sad for being spent my time and money on this riduculas movie-called trash. First of all, it is intented to be a movie for grown ups, but everything, including acting, is just childish. Nicole thinks of something and voila it is all done and the Stepford is rescued. What is this really? It may have been good in the past but now I could not understand how anyone can like and, more terrible, can make this kind on movies. I don't know who Frank Oz, the director is, but I promise to not to go to any of his movies, because if all of them are just like this one, he can keep them in his private collection. Actually, I am sad because, I really liked the story and the idea of seeking perfection but the plot and the realization of the whole scenario is so premature that it makes you curse and curse and curse. With little talent and more realistic conclusions this could have been at least a watchable movie. But right now, it is just an idiotic masturbation of Frank Oz. Sorry, but I just can't accept being treated as an idiot. Also, if Nicole Kidman is participating in these kind of projects then I should be sorry for her as well, because most probably she is getting old and uncapable of better roles. I am sorry, if I offended anyone, but this movie sucks in every aspect. I rarely write my opinions on world wide web, but the movie made me so angry that I decided to warn you about it. It is the worst movie that you will ever see.</fullReview>

Did they really think we wouldn't notice? Frankly it is an insult to the audience's intelligence and Frank Oz owes me $12 and an apology...

		<fullReview>That was a rhetorical question, by the way. What I mean to say is, what does a version of 'The Stepford Wives' in 2004 have to do with *anything*? A blistering critique of gender roles that haven't existed in American &amp; European society for half-a-century? You can make a film critical of past social mores, but you can't present it as an edgy contemporary satire. It's an "answer film" that's 50 years too late. Imagine if Ted Post had answered John Wayne's 'The Green Berets' with 'Go Tell the Spartans', only in 1997. Maybe the producers can follow up 'The Stepford Wives' with a withering satire of class-snobbery in Victorian England or the hypocrisy of New Left hippies in 1960's America. Because these films would be PRECISELY as relevant and edgy as 'The Stepford Wives'.If you want to see a film that is a great satirical comedy *and* has something to say about gender &amp; feminism in contemporary society, watch 'Fight Club'.

An earnest thespian such as Close makes herself ridiculous here.Nicole Kidman seemed to become more and more ambitious with brilliant demanding efforts such as "the others"-she was marvelous as Grace- "hours" or "dogville" .As a Stepford wife,she hits rock bottom .It's her worst part by such a wide margin I cannot imagine she could give a weaker performance in the future.The novel has been "updated ": Johanna had two "normal" female friends at the beginning of the novel.Bobbie (Middler)was kept,but the second one was replaced by Roger, a likable gay (Roger Bart).This is minor quibble (why not after all?)but which is less admissible is the way the script writers end the story;an open ending -which ,like Levin's "Rosemary Baby" -there are similarities between the two stories:both heroines are victims of a huge conspiracy)- left what happened next to the viewer's imagination..I was very disappointed by this film,given all the talent involved.</fullReview>

However, I have a problem with WHAT these women are supposed to be... When they arrive in Stepford, they are real women. Mike explains that the Stepford Program implants chips into their brains. But then the movie shows them as robot women who dispense money like an ATM. At the end, however Johanna fries all of their chips and all of the women go back to normal. Even though moments before when Johanna is with her husband and he is trying to convince her to be a Stepford wife, she sees an empty shell of herself... What the hell? It doesn't make any sense. Are they robots or not? Even the dog in the movie. It was originally a dog, but then it becomes a robot dog. Bobby, after transformation, lights her hand on fire without even wincing. It doesn't make any sense at the end of the movie when they go back to being human just by having their chips fried. These writers need to get their story together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem with remakes is all but the VERY best of them are simply unnecessary at best and cringe-inducing pile of fecal matter at worst (this film is firmly rooted in the latter by the way). The extremely low number of these movies that DO work, manage to do so because they innovate. John Carpenter's "The Thing", and Cronenberg's "the Fly" automatically spring to mind because they truly weren't beholden to either of their respective originals and made them their own movies. What do we have that's new in the Stepford Wives? A flamingly gay half of a homosexual couple and a moronically lame ending. Which isn't innovative in the least really. The great Christopher Walken gets to play a pale parody of himself, Bette Midler is painfully unfunny, and the whole production just reeks of bad decisions. It's so awful that Ira Levin is undoubtedly spinning in his grave. Now he's not dead yet. The movie is just so atrocious that it made Ira drive all the way to his burial plot (the only time i'll mention "plot" in this review by the way), dig it up, put a casket down there, climb in and spin around in it. Which would be a hell of a lot of work and I bet is extremely tiring, Without a doubt Frank Oz's worst film and yes i DID see "Housesitter"My Grade: D-</fullReview>

Even Christopher Walken was unfunny and he is always funny. I think the main problem of the movie is that Matthew Broderick and Nicole Kidman were the main characters. Matthew Broderick just can't act and Nicole Kidman should not do comedy.The movie is also totally predictable. Even though there are tons plot twists, you can see them coming every time. By the end of the movie I was just praying that Arnold Schwarzenegger as John Matrix would walk in and take out the whole town.

		<shortDescription>Less funny than the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an updated and revised version of the 1975 original. The first version was presented to us as a serious story about the subjugation of women but, like "Mommie Dearest", turned out to be more amusing than dramatic.In this version the comedy inherent in the conceit is out in the open. The only problem is that it's not too funny. Not the fault of the performers, who are all good. Nicole Kidman is a fine actress and comedy is well within her range. Bette Midler, by contrast, is always comic and always Bette Midler. Midler's post-conversion sweetness is hilarious mainly because we see Bette Milder trying so HARD to play "sweet." Mathew Broderick is not bad either, perhaps a bit bland but it fits the part. Glen Close, trapped in her robotic role, is almost unrecognizable beneath the makeup. Christopher Walken gives the best performance of the bunch, as he so often does. Every line he utters has some sort of quirky quality. And he must have enormous self control because he gets the funniest lines and never cracks a smile. Watch him present the TV commercial that will be used "when we go global." He wears a white lab coat, like a TV doctor, and walks the viewer through the robotization process with careless ease. He's even funny after he gets his head knocked off and the sparks fly out.I said it was updated, and what I meant is that there is now a gay couple living in Stepford. And Paula Prentiss has been replaced by Bette Midler, so a lot of jokes about Jews show up -- "why not decorate your menorah with pine cones?" "How about if I just arrange a lot of pine cones on my front lawn so that they spell out BIG JEW?" The original had to do with men feeling threatened by their wives' desire to raise their consciousness, whatever that means, and to develop interests outside the home. This version has gone beyond that vague feeling of oppression. The Stepford Wives are now all ex-CEOs, brain surgeons, and Pulitzer Prize winners. Even the robot terrier was a prize winner. The men no longer feel threatened. They stopped worrying about that years ago. Now they just feel humiliated and beaten by their more successful spouses.What humor there is can be found mostly in one-liners. Wisecracks that are sometimes funny imposed on an essentially humdrum script. The situations themselves aren't amusing. There is, for instance, no scene to equal the one in which Katherine Ross stabs the now-robotic Paula Prentiss in the vicinity of her belly button, shorts out a couple of anodes, and sends Prentiss into a stereotyped infinite loop of behavior -- going through the motions of serving coffee but letting the cups drop on the floor and so on. Now THAT'S funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it was OK but something about the story just fell flat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joanna and Walter are one of 3 new couples in the town of Stepford. She was a very successful president of a network but was fired, so the family moves out of the city. The other 2 couples Dave and Bobbie and Roger and Jerry are Joanna's new friends. It doesn't take long for them to see that the wives in town act too perfect and are all knock outs. Joanna and Bobbie become suspicious once Roger gets a transformation. They snoop and eventually its up to Joanna to solve the mystery and convince her husband not to do the same.The movie was amusing at times but not funny. It felt like a part was missing in the middle. I would have liked to see more of the wives and the quirky things the robots do. And Glenn Close is the only Stepfor wife that has a speaking role.FINAL VERDICT: This was nothing to rush out to see. If you catch it on cable one afternoon, it may be worth your 90 minutes you have to waste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, mindless fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie for my birthday when it came out in June. The first time I saw it I saw it, I enjoyed enormously. The second time, the critic in me reared its ugly head and I started noticing all the not-so-good parts. And the bad does seem to outweigh the good. But, if you're in need of some mindless fun and stargazing, this is the right movie. The cast does a wonderful job with what they have, turning what could have been some horrid, mind-numbing garbage into humorous, exceptionally cheesy fun. Nicole Kidman does a bang up job in this less than stellar role, as does Matthew Broderick and Christopher Walken. But the movie was stolen by the supporting cast of Bette Midler as the outspoken wonderfully blunt Bobbie Markowitz, Glenn Close as the psychotically perfect Claire and of course where would we be without the dumb blonde? Faith Hill does a hilarious job as the seemingly brainless Sarah Sunderson. If you happen to find this movie, do not expect a chillingly dark horror, but rather a fairly corny comedy that still leaves you wondering.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty average effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering the talent on display it's a pretty lame effort all round. The film tries to be funny but doesn't really showcase the best talents of all of the actors. Nicole is unrealistic as the exec who has fallen from grace, Broderick doesn't come across as insignificant as he did in "Election", Lovitz is no match for Midler, Walken isn't his usual creepy self and Faith Hill is far more attractive in real life.Does the volume of movies that people like Kidman and Walken put out mean we are to expect more poor efforts. On the DVD Kidman did say that this was a fun relaxing movie after the intense filming of "Birth". Perhaps she should have taken a holiday instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first Stepford was much better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not care for this remake of this title. The first one was much better with a better story and outline. I know that when they do remakes they try to "update" certain things about the film, well, in my opinion somethings are better left alone.For example, the occupations of the stars. In the original the wife was a photographer, not a television mogul, and her Husband certainly did not work in the same company. Second, the robotic dog? I am sure the director thought this was a nice touch, I did not however. What was with the wives dispensing money out of their mouths? Finally, Christopher Walken's character was a robot! How lame is that?Another thing about this film which differs from the first is, the suspense. The first film was a suspense/thriller. This film was supposed to be a comedy. I think?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny but flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT: This flat-out, broadly played comic remake of a 1970s sci-fi thriller has a terrific cast and some truly funny lines, as a New York City couple (a smart and sassy but repressed, dressed-in-black TV exec Nicole Kidman and her woebegone schmuck of a corporate drone husband Matthew Broderick) moves to woodsy lower-Fairfield County, Connecticut to start over again. Only they find they are surrounded by a bunch of drop-dead gorgeous robot women, wholly subservient to their geeky menfolk and acting and dressing as if it were the '50s all over again. Much merriment ensues. The film is harmed on two counts: It is unclear about to what degree the wives are robots. (In fact, all that remains of the originals are their brains which have been reprogrammed, meaning they are actually androids -- and this point is not properly handled, leaving viewers easily confused.) Plus the flick doesn't know when to stop and has no fewer than three endings. It should have stopped after the first one, which involves a thoroughly transformed Nicole Kidman grocery shopping. Instead, the screenwriters go for a very awkward, politically correct, series of happy endings, and mess up badly. Well, having said that, see it anyhow for Kidman and Bette Midler as her nonconforming, sad-sack writer friend who becomes the Betty Crocker to end all Betty Crockers. Midler's transformation is the closest tie this amusing little flick has to the downbeat but clever, sometimes sinister original. Both are based on a popular satire by the author who brought us ROSEMARY'S BABY: Ira Levin, a Yale grad who definitely knows from certain lower-Fairfield County types. Heck, I've met a few of these robot types myself, in places where this film was shot, including Darien and Greenwich. Where better to hide robots, indeed?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching "The Stepford Wives" I can't help but feel cheated. I wasn't exactly expecting a movie that would be filled with non-stop laughs, but I was expecting at least a chuckle or two. The movie stars Nicole Kidman as a TV executive who is unceremoniously terminated after a reality based show she produced resulted in a jaded husband going psycho and shooting up his estranged wife and her lovers (oh please). To brighten her perspective on life after show biz, her husband (Matthew Broderick) moves her and their children to a small town named Stepford in Connecticut. Here everything seems to be perfect. The wives are the epitome of happiness; smiles, cheerfulness and a spunk not seen since the late 1950s. On the other hand, the husbands seem to do nothing but play with rock 'em sock 'em robots, smoke cigars, and generally be chauvinistic. Kidman's character slowly begins to discover clues to point to something dark going on behind closed doors in Stepford that causes the women change their personalities.This film was a poor attempt at a dark comedy. The jokes fell flat and some of the actors did not even appear to enjoy being in the film (watch Kidman, especially). The film also starts Glenn Close, Christopher Walken and Bette Midler as residents of the community. The ending is quite predictable and leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth. I'm giving this film a 4/10 just because I have seen much worse in recent months (i.e. In the Cut, Center Stage, 3/4ths of Dirty Dancing, etc. )</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Where would no one notice a town full of robots?" Connecticut. (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a sad, sad film. The Stepford Wives only proves that big stars and a big name director like Frank Oz do not always make good pictures. There was nothing worth saving from this movie. From the opening scenes to the final credits, and all that I found lying in-between was pure gibberish. It is annoying to find a film with such decent actors to be so horribly bad. Kidman has been working very hard lately to make a name for herself in the Hollywood community that a film like this could debunk her. From the story, to the poorly mismatched characters, to the cheap CGI, this film smelled of recycled garbage from the opening. It should have been returned, but instead I forged ahead and watched.As bad as this film was, there was a glimmer of light at the beginning. Kidman's character is somewhat humorous as the television executive with ideas on how to make women more powerful on screen. What she shows her shareholders are tiny morsels of comedy, but those are quickly eaten nothing is left behind except for crumbs. From the moment that she leaves the podium, her role is over. Kidman tries to capture the essence of her character, but just cannot. I have trouble-seeing Kidman as a comic actress, especially when she has mastered the drama/thriller/musical genre so well. The lack of comfortability with her character is ultimately what flaws Kidman's performance from the start. You just never see her excitement or comfort level in her eyes. You never saw her true character. This goes the same with everyone else in this film. Broderick was the worst decision as her husband. They had no chemistry, no love, and no passion. I saw them as two actors with lines instead of a secure relationship. Couple this with more horrible performances by Midler (who never quite reaches the high of her character), Glenn Close (who seemed like she was over-the-top with her character and just finally happy to be in a film with some big name stars), Lovitz (what was he doing in this movie?), and even the always lovable Walken (who seemed stale and sterile throughout the entire film) just flopped. The actors and their inability to carry this film to a higher level was only half the issue with this film, the other problem lied in the hands of director Frank Oz.What was he thinking in this film? It felt like his children got into the editing room and spilled glue on the cut film and that was the way he edited it. There was no continuity at all. We would jump from one location to the next and then further again without any warning or care. This creates a sense of distraction and unease in the tone of the film. Secondly, did Oz know what this film was about? At one point I thought that these women were robots, and the next they are humans with computer chips in their minds. What about the sparks? What about the ATM? This never seemed to fit at all. It was as if Oz had made two films and spliced the beginning of one and the end of the other together. First time filmmakers could have done a better job than Frank Oz on this film. I needed this to be a very dark comedy (if even a comedy at all). Where was the darkness in this film? I will tell you ? THERE WASN'T ANY! If there was anything at all in this film, I would give credit, but there has been nothing redeemable about this film at all. The choppy direction that Oz perfects jumbles the themes and tones to nearly nothing. I could not honestly sit here and tell you what the tone of the film was. I think it was locked somewhere in Oz's mind, and it couldn't get out. This goes the same with the theme of the film. Does it have something to do with perfection or feminism? A happy home or being wealthy? Maybe it has to do with cooking cup cakes over pies? How about playing God in suburbia? Who knows? I couldn't tell, and I am definitely not willing to watch it again to find out. Overall, this was the worst film that I have seen this year by far. The ending was laughable and just plain stupid, as you could probably say the same for the rest of the film. All the actors did the worst jobs they could and it became increasingly obvious that Oz should just go back to doing Muppet voices. There is nothing of value in this movie and if you chose to spend the money to see it than at least you have been warned. This is yet another perfect example of a Hollywood blunder. Where was the Inspector Gadget music when you needed it? BLAH!Grade: * out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Stepford Wives (2004)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Spoiler)'The Stepford Wives' started with so much promise. I really enjoyed the opening segment that featured Nicole Kidman promoting the new programme line-up for her television network only to be interrupted by the great writer/actor Mike White ('Chuck &amp; Buck', 'Orange County', 'The Good Girl' and 'School of Rock') but I will say no more. The beginning, to me, set-up what could have been a really good black comedy, but it went down hill from there.Nicole Kidman carries this movie as it is all about her. The cast have some impressive names but don't really do much (Christopher Walken: Why do you do these films?). Under this director this should have been better but in recent years he has floated into the world of the mediocre.I'm not a fan of the first version but I think I preferred the new take on the story.Not great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the movie. I thought the jokes were good and the story was interesting. But the glaring plot hole is what finally gives this movie a failing mark. Are the people robots or chip-enhanced humans? I don't know and it made the ending confusing, when it wasn't supposed to be confusing. I read that the people (mainly the wives) were supposed to be robots but test screenings showed that people wanted them to be human. And for that reason, reshoots had to happen and the editing was not careful to remove all traces of robots. In the end, I have to give this a 4/10 - not my worst score ever because I still did stay to the end of the movie nor did I fall asleep during the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, if you've never seen the original versions of "The Stepford Wives" go ahead and see the remake. You'll probably enjoy it. There actually are a number of things to like. There are some very fun moments. And a great comic turn by Glen Close.But if you have seen the original I'd advice against seeing this mess. They sold it out. I get that they made it into a comedy which is fine. The first half was very funny. But when it decided to become a "thriller" it fell apart. The tried to make you care when they whole time they've created this Willy Wonka world that is so unreal that you could never take it seriously.Then there's the ending. I don't know that I love the ending of the original but at least it's more real than the train wreck of an ending they up on on the end of this. It is neither real nor funny.As Nicole Kidman doesn't even hold a candle to Katherine Ross in terms of sympathy in the role of Joanna.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best thing that could happen to this is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>that it is SO bad that it may become a cult classic - Ira Levin cared about his characters- what we know from the original rendition of this story-Joanna Eberhart(Katherine Ross) had 2 little girls ,loved kids, was a photographer,knew all the songs from Sesame St(she tells this to Walter when he has to mind the kids for 1 day)and lost her virginity to a trustworthy chemist who later tests her water from Stepford. We do not know any of this in the newest attempt at "Stepford Wives" . None of this was deemed relevant by anyone in the latest version. What we DO know is that Joanna Eberhart(now Nicole Kidman) has a boy and a girl that she never sees and puts BAD TV on the air- that her husband (Matthew Broderick ) basically works FOR her. We never get to know Bobbie(Bette Midler), or any of the other characters- because there is neither character nor plot development.Therefore it is hard to care for any of them. Sadly , the best thing in this version is Faith Hill who admits this was her 1st acting job. While I did not expect a verbatim rendition of the original-I do think that the message of covert male power is still a factor in the world today. I doubt that it would have been impossible or even difficult for the people involved in this film to have updated the problem as it exists today. What we got instead were cheap shots all around. I was warned that it wasn't as dark as the original-I wasn't warned that it was just plain silly. About as silly as the commercial that Christopher Walken shows in the climax.Definitely no one read the book-or if they did- failed to understand it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stepford-Far From Perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Stepford Wives is a movie that reeks of being in a hurry. Even though the filming schedule was elongated, the final product doesn't show it. The sets look as if they came under budget on time and effort. They look cheap and quickly thrown together. The change from Manhattan city life to perfect Stepford land is unnoticeable in the way the dress, setting and style of the film and characters appear. Because of this, it's clear that the ?clean and neat' style the film may have been going for is not a commentary on its theme of perfection, but simply the lack of effort to make it otherwise. The story is adapted from the original thriller, The Stepford Wives and hence the originality of its plot is not something the crew of this production can take credit for. Joanna Eberhart (Nicole Kidman) has lost her position has a high ranking official in the television world and, with her husband (Matthew Broderick) and their children, moves to Stepford, the setting of this mediocre thriller and `mystery'. Why are these women so perfect? Where do the men go all day? What do they do there? The audience knows the answers and so we watch Kidman try to answer these questions but instead simply establish herself as a drama queen. Her performance lacks originality and, although she is believable, she has not completely separated herself from Nicole into Joanna. The supporting cast is comic relief (and they're not really all that comical). Bett Middler plays the odd girl and with her gay sidekick, they join Joanna in an attempt to answer their questions about the robotic barbies posing as wives, but instead feel like extra baggage. Of course, it's just now that Joanna's there that the preoccupied feminist and her Queer Eye clone have decided that there's something strange going on. That's the movies for you. Or rather, that's Stepford. The cast and crew of this movie knew it was bad. They refused comment on it. They went back and attempted re-shoots to improve open it's flaws. But however it happened, a week of pick-up shots can't change the problem of this movie. In fact, the entire thing looks like it was filmed with ten different directors over the course of ten months. Every aspect of each scene looks like it was stolen from twenty different movies and then photoshopped to fit the current directors image. This movie is clumsy, confused and very un-Stepford. **/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie for movies' sake...but its really just not of good material to be remade. This movie had a good script, great acting, fun and comedy and suspense and drama, and it had an all-star cast...but why make this movie if the writers and director didn't want it at all to be like the original movie! The original movie was sad and dramatic, and it was like a horror film. The screwed up ALL of the characters in this movie, changed EVERYTHING around, it just wasn't a remake! It was a new movie based like the first one but it wasn't at all the same movie! The ending was completely different, don't make a feel-good ending for a feel-good movie if you aren't at all GETTING THE BOOK AUTHOR'S INTENTIONS ACROSS! THE THROUGH-LINE WASN'T THE SAME. The original movie was about society and a mother's hold on life. This movie is about a man's weakness and a woman's strength. So overall, this was a good movie if you want to see a good movie...it just wasn't worth remaking because of the script and director's direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miss Piggy had more bite, and generally speaking, better lines.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may be one of those movies that no one likes but the people; the public screening I attended had the audience in stitches, including my 80-year-old mother-in-law, who pronounced it, 'cute.' But the Frank Oz remake of, 'The Stepford Wives,' may also bomb at the box office, not only of its own failings (and there are many), but of the negative publicity the production has received for months. In the re-imagining of the creepy 1975 original, Joanna Eberhart (Nicole Kidman) comes to Stepford, Connecticut with her husband (Matthew Broderick) and children, only to find a community of wives, led by real estate agent Claire Wellington (Glenn Close), who seem to be Barbie Doll realizations of 1950's-style female servitude. They are picture-perfect, sexually voracious, robotic re-creations of the wives of Stepford men. The first film, from a script by the legendary screenwriter William Goldman, targeted devious husbands; the new film, written by Paul Rudnick, satirizes overachieving, workaholic wives. The first film sought to be a psychological thriller; the re-make seeks to be a comedy. And in all fairness, there are some funny scenes and some good lines. But overall, the film falls short on comedic bite, and leaves most of the best one-liners to secondary characters. Bette Midler is amusing as a rebellious, Betty Friedan-esque writer (Bobby Markowitz), who is as amazed as Joanna by the behavior of the dollbots. They team up with another Stepford newcomer, Roger Bannister (Roger Bart), a very catty, 'girlfriend,' whose gay lover has found acceptance in the diabolical Stepford Men's Club, headed by Wellington's husband Mike (Christopher Walken). Together, they're going to get to the bottom of things. Kidman and Walken are said to have both had problems with the script, Walken reportedly engaging in shouting matches with Oz in the director's office. Ego-charged bickering on the set, coupled with the director's perfectionism, apparently put the project behind schedule. Kidman has said she took the role when Producer Scott Rudin convinced her it would be a very light workout in comparison to her Oscar-winning turn in 'The Hours,' which had required that she work about three weeks. 'Scott said to me, 'Do this movie, and it will feel like summer camp,' Kidman told the Ladies Home Journal. Instead, it turned into a marathon she had not experienced since Stanley Kubrick's, 'Eyes Wide Shut.' When 'Stepford' production went over schedule, Kidman had to drop out of the thriller, 'Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith,' with Brad Pitt. When 'Stepford' finally wrapped, she went to work on Sidney Pollock's, 'The Interpreter,' then had all sorts of scheduling problems when Oz needed her back for re-shoots. As production dragged on, Midler found herself splitting her time between the film's shooting demands and the necessity of rehearsing for her huge 'Kiss My Brass' concert tour that had long been scheduled. Director Frank Oz has made about seven comedies since his days as Jim Henson's strong right arm at the Muppets factory, and one pretty taut thriller. His 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,' with Steven Martin, Michael Caine and Glenne Headly, is a comedy classic, and the Rudnick-penned, 'In and Out,' with Kevin Klein, was wonderful. Recognized for providing the classic voice for Yoda in the 'Star Wars' films, and for his performances for years as Miss Piggy, Fonzie Bear, Bert, Grover, and the Cookie Monster, all from the Muppets menagerie, Oz is known as a genuinely nice person. But this is his second round of difficulties with actors. In his excellent thriller, 'The Score,' notoriously difficult Marlon Brando refused to take direction from Oz, forcing the British-born director to use co-star Robert DeNiro as an intermediary.Is 'The Stepford Wives' worth seeing? Maybe, but it will require some effort on your part. Here's my suggestion. Put together a group of your brightest, funniest, most outgoing friends and go to the movie. As the picture starts drawing to a close (the beginning of the ballroom scene will be your cue), leave the theater, repair to the nearest venue for adult beverages, and write your own ending. Even your dullest pals will come up with something better than what the nervous Paramount executives forced on Oz and his dispirited cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw 'The Stepford Wives' the theater workers accidentally but in the reel of the third 'Harry Potter' film, causing us to wait about twenty minutes more to see the movie. They made a mistake. So did Frank Oz in making this film.'The Stepford Wives' is the twelfth 2004 movie I've seen. The others consisted of masterworks ('Kill Bill: Vol. 2', 'The Passion of the Christ' and 'Spartan'), fun, shallow stuff ('Troy', 'Miracle', 'Shrek 2', 'Secret Window' and 'Hellboy'), and stupidly funny romps ('50 First Dates' and 'Dodgeball'). The last movie was 'You Got Served' ? the only one of all eleven that was actually worse than 'Stepford'.The story focuses on Joanna (Nicole Kidman) and Walter (Matthew Broderick), husband and wife who move to Stepford, a town where everything seems perfect. But, as we all know, if there is something perfect in a movie, there is something horrifying and, well, imperfect behind it. In this film, the men control their women with remote controls. Joanna, with the help of an angry writer (Bette Midler) who is ? ha ha! ? Jewish, and a flamboyant gay (Roger Bart), investigates what's up.Spoilers, I guess.I think it's common knowledge by now that the women all of microchips in their brains. I don't even want to list all the flaws that this plot point brings up, but I will anyway. 1) The men are frequently calling the women robots ? even though they're apparently flesh-and-blood humans. 2) At one point a woman takes a credit card in her mouth and spits out bills ? even though she's just human. 3) In another scene a woman's breasts enlarge with the push of a button?I didn't know they could do that! 4) A character is found out to be a robot, even though no character had ever implied that they had any knowledge of making robots. And, finally, the big one: 5) just moments after finding out that the women have chips in their brains (and are NOT robots) Joanna sees a robot ready to replace her.Now, I know, it's not supposed to be an accurate movie and you're not supposed to pin point all the flaws, but these are some huge, glaring flaws.They're the Jabba the Hut of plot flaws. Honestly, what the hell were the screenwriters thinking? Did they think the audience wouldn't notice? Did they notice? Were the test screenings held in a kindergarten class? No, they mustn't have been, kindergarteners would notice these errors.But, just because my review is negative I'm not going to lie, it delivered some laughs (but just a few). Mostly in the first hour, they fade away once the movie starts going for horror and (bad) melodrama. As for acting, well, Kidman and Broderick do what they can, and Midler seems to be having fun, but they can't save it. The only performance I really liked was Christopher Walken, and that's only because he's Christopher Walken and can make any movie a teensy-weensy bit better (though I have yet to see 'Gigli').The film has two climaxes, the first of which there is no buildup to, the second is just too long and, well, we don't care. The climaxes describe the film ? uneven, unexciting, unfunny, unsurprising. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adolescent stab at a movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Stepford Wives" is an adolescent stab at a comical film. There are some saving moments, however, they are few a far between. And the attempt to be funny is so obvious that one remains feeling sorry for the quality actors involved. Glen Close is tragically misused. Christopher Walkin is stiff and uncomfortable in his comic role, although in a way he plays a villain. The computer generated gimmicks are odd. Bette Mitler is funny in her role, but the film is not worth her performance. Nicole Kidman is misused, particularly in view of all of her great work in the past. This film should remain asleep in the can. Don't waste your time with it. Perhaps renting it in the months to come will be o.k. if you have nothing better to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lightweight remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of the 1975 film but the emphasis here is on comedy and not horror which only makes sense because the so-called secret is shown in all the trailers for the film. Story is about Joanna Eberhard (Nicole Kidman) who is fresh from being fired as a television executive and going through a mental breakdown so her husband Walter Kresby (Matthew Broderick) moves her and their two kids to Stepford, Conn. They move in and discover that the wives of their community are unusually cheerful and domesticated. They are also very beautiful and spend their days cleaning house and baking and engaging in sex during the afternoon. This irks Joanna but she meets author Bobbie Markowitz (Bette Midler) who has also just moved into the community with her family and together they discuss how different everyone is compared to them.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Walter enjoys his new home and community and he regularly goes to the local Men's Club which is run by Mike Wellington (Christopher Walken) and soon enough all the husbands show Walter what the secret is in Stepford. Everyone's wife has had computer chips installed in their brain and the husbands have a remote control that can make them do anything they want. Walters marriage is in trouble and he loves his new life but now he must decide if he should go along with the others or not.This film is directed by veteran Frank Oz who is a very good director but reportedly this script went through a few re-writes and re-shoots and the end result is a pretty lightweight and politically correct film. The one aspect of the story from the original 1975 film still remains interesting today and that's the angle about men and do they still want their wives to be homemakers. It's still a pertinent issue especially in todays times where marriages usually have the husband and wife both working. But aside from that and the sometimes funny lines that are given this is a film that ends up being predictable with an overly simplistic ending. I do have one question though and it involves that replica of Kidman laying on the table. What is it's purpose? If the secret is that computer chips are being installed in the wives brains then I don't understand the use of a replica. But, I guess that's nit picking but this is a film that seems below the talent of it's actors. The 1975 version is a dark horror film that had audiences talking about the underlying message but this updated story has it's emphasis on comedy and when it's over there is nothing to discuss about it. It makes no impact whatsoever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Several things really bothered me about this movie, but the biggest was that there was no real suspense created. The movie gave away pretty much all it's secrets right away. I was unfamiliar with what it was going to be about and found it highly disappointing. Even when I see movies I know the end to I expect more suspense than this offers.I thought all of the actors turned in brilliant performances; Nicole Kidman was emotionally driven, and all the other actors seemed to really do a nice job, including the Wives, who had to act perfect in unison. Even the oft-criticized Matthew Broderick made a good mediocre husband to his powerhouse wife, and I could see him wrestling with his decision, but it created very little drive for the story.I think the bulk of this movie's problem seemed to be how it was all put together. It could have explored a lot of issues deeper, it could have been a lot more engaging, but it wasn't. The film couldn't make up it's mind what it wanted to be, and wound up being nothing.Plus there was the robot/microchip inconsistency...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Stepford Wives: 3/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually I have no problems with remakes if they're done successfully. Of course, that didn't authorize Gus Van Sant's Psycho, but that's beside the point. Frank Oz (who many recognize as the voice of Yoda and Miss Piggy from the Muppets, among others), already had one successful remake under his belt (the enjoyable Little Shop of Horrors), but needed more. So he decided to remake an obscure 1975 thriller about a town that's too perfect, The Stepford Wives. And now I think I'm on the bandwagon on saying that all of these remakes need to be stopped NOW.Joanna (Nicole Kidman, badly masking her accent yet again) is a successful TV person (executive? president? I don't remember), but after there's an assassination attempt on her (during a 15 minute overview of the new season-completely unnecessary [except for a 'pun' later]), she's fired. She and her less successful husband Walter (Matthew Broderick, who seems to be underused lately) move with their two kids to Stepford, Connecticut, where it seems like everyone's stuck in the 1950's. But something's not right, as Joanna senses, and tries to discover what it is, while Walter gets dragged into the chauvinistic society that the Stepford husbands share. Random characters (including that ubiquitous Christopher Walken) ensue.I could reiterate what every reviewer has been saying. I could say how this attempt at comedy, drama, and horror tries to be all three and fails at all three-which it does, completely. It falls over on its padded-runtime face many times whenever it tries to be one of the three. When it tries to be funny, it just isn't: you can flush the toilets from a control panel by the front door. Now isn't that hilarious? And when Walter has to choose between Joanna and a "perfect" wife (you'll understand if you see the movie...but you really shouldn't see it), the drama's supposed to be running high up. DUH! What do you think's gonna happen? And the whole concept (which might have been scary in the 1975 version, I didn't see it) just isn't scary. All of these problems don't lie in Oz (it seems like he's doing a bit of struggling for work), but in Paul Rudnick's screenplay. He tries to squeeze so much into it that it just doesn't work. Any of the plot "twists" that come about can be seen basically during the opening credits. Well, not the "final" twist, but that's too stupid to even mention.Characters run to and fro without an iota of development (Jon Lovitz was in the movie?) and pop in just to say "funny" things or to help the "plot" along. But that's not even the worst of it. In every single scene-no exaggeration-there is either a boom mike or part of the camera in frame. I can forgive one or two-those things are pretty hard to avoid-but Stepford is such a slipshod, one-hand-tied-behind-your-back movie that they just don't care about making something that's technically well done. The only thing well done about this movie is Roger Bart as one of Stepford's only two gay men (such a stretch from his role as Carmen Ghia in the Broadway version of The Producers). Without his small character, the movie would be laugh less, every character uninteresting, and, well, the movie would still be awful. Basically, stay away from The Stepford Wives.My rating: 3/10Rated PG-13 for sexual content, thematic material and language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some laughs, but not invested enough to care</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS perhaps?***Right off the bat I suppose I should say that I have NOT seen the original film and therefore only had expectations that were developed via the trailers. It is my style to begin reviews with the good stuff and then move on from there, so here we go:The Good Stuff. The acting. Overall, I thought the acting was quite good. Nicole Kidman as (almost) always was fabulous. Her reaction to getting fired was very good. There are only a few actors who can handle a steady shot on their face for so long. She's great. The rest of the characters are pretty memorable, probably Glenn Close in particular. The concept of the movie was good, although it is based on a previously made movie that was based on a book, so it's not terribly original. I did laugh out loud more than once, particulary at the book club scene. Nothing says "I love Jesus" like yarn. True dat. But beyond the cast and the occasional laugh, there is not much.The Bad Stuff. Okay, call me crazy, but for me I don't care much for a movie if I don't care much for, or at least understand, the characters. In the case of this movie, I was not invested in our two main characters one bit. We see them together in only one scene before they head to Stepford, and Nicole's character was comotose. We don't discover that their marriage is on the rocks until half-way through the movie, and their relationship is the impetus for the movie! Basically I was given no reason to care about the two main characters. At all. I cared more about the supporting gay characters because we actually saw their relationship and how it worked. And it only took about 30 seconds of screen time. By the time I knew what the main characters' relationship was like, I did not care. My other problem with the movie was plot holes. I know that the movie is not meant to be based in reality. It's a fantasy. BUT there was so little explanation about how the women got turned into robots. It seemed like they put them into new bodies or something, but then the end wouldnt make sense if that was the case. I dunno, the specifics seemed sloppy. The Summary. I laughed a couple of times, and was impressed with Nicole and Glenn. I did not care about the characters and there was some big plot holes. Basically, it was like watching the trailer stretched out to 90 minutes. Neither the characters nor the plot were any further fleshed out. Anyhoo. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>*Laugh City*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie sooooo much! Every zing was funny, and as my friend Alyce and I sat in the theater this weekend watching it, there were even moments that the whole audience was laughing. Even though I am a Connecticut resident, and have been for my whole life, I still found the Connecticut jokes entertaining. I guess that's because I have a sense of humor, but for the critics who don't, they shouldn't even see this film. I am an incoming sophomore at UCONN, age 19, and a bit immature. If I can admit to that, I can't be too immature, but still. My favorite movies were in the Austin Powers series or anything starring David Spade.The story follows ordinary Joanna (Kidman) from her high-class CEO seat to her new housewife status in Stepford, Connecticut. Husband Walter (Broderick) is a true man: someone who uses a little deception to get his wife thinking about her crazy situation but protects her in the end when she can't get up for herself. Glenn Close, Bette Midler, Jon Lovitz, Faith Hill and Christopher Walken also hold great roles in the film.I am the kind of person who can't watch a horror movie. If you prefer thrillers, don't see this movie. It's a comedy, straight-forward. Only one part of the movie made me jump from fright, and that was at the end. If you appreciate fun cinema, true love and are young at heart, please consider seeing The Stepford Wives (2004).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robots? Where?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My problems with this movie deal around the consistency and the pacing.The movie starts of dreadfully slow. Slow and pointless. Then the movie speeds up. So far as to be in overdrive. Characters (mainly Joanne) have FAR too strong of reactions to simple situations. This gives a very piecemeal feeling to the entire movie.By far my biggest complaint though is the lack of explanation and consistency when it comes to the actual wives. They call the wives robots, but they're not robots. They're normal woman with microchips implanted on their brains. Last time I checked that didn't resemble a robot in the slightest. But they had artificial bodies of the woman laying around... WHY!? So they're not robots, the movie tells us this... BUT they can burn themselves and not be hurt, have ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS, and DISPENSE CASH FROM THEIR MOUTHS. So how exactly does a microchip on the brain allow you to spit up money?Frankly I'm baffled by this movie. I think they should recall the thing, fix the horribly obvious errors, and reship. Maybe then I would enjoy it more.How do you go SO wrong, with such a good cast?\/\/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly, don't waste your time.The producers were not diligent enough here. The script is a half-baked comedy/fright hybrid that makes no real attempt at shaping an authentic story line. The director forgot to tell Kidman that she can't resort to her teary eyed intensity (a la "the hours") every time it is time to act "emotional" instead of "ironic". The D.P. thought that he could get away with a monotonous washed out look because he was creating a dream land. Dream land doesn't mean the whole thing looks like a cupcake (even when the 'dramatic' scenes are happening). Broderick again cannot find his footing, there is no red Ferrari or 'Twist and Shout' extravaganza to save him this time, one would think an aide would whisper this in his ear. Two points( of ten ) for a palm (not hand) full of great one-liners.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>More than a remake, the 2004 version of "The Stepford Wives" takes a look at the falsity of our modern society: the women are perfect beyond credibility and the men are panting nerds - not to mention that when Joanna Eberhart (Nicole Kidman) tries to have a career, it turns out to be rather unpleasant. The original version was almost one step away from a horror movie, but this one is more satirical. And to the extent that it is a remake, they expand on the original version to make it more like the 21st century.Although Nicole Kidman gets top billing, my favorite character was Bette Midler, as brassy author Bobbie Markowitz; just listen to some of her book titles (warning: they're not for the squeamish). Also starring Matthew Broderick as Joanna's husband Walter Cresby, and Glenn Close, Christopher Walken, and Jon Lovitz as some of Stepford's other citizens (you'll probably either laugh or get irked by Glenn Close's comment about Bette Midler).So what would YOU think of living in Stepford?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Step Away From Stepford.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A high-class New York couple (Nicole Kidman and Matthew Broderick) moves to a strange town in Connecticut where all the women seem to be perfect.......well perfect for all their husbands anyway. Plot holes galore here as Christopher Walken seems to run the community by electronically programming and/or brainwashing (the film never quite decides which) wife Glenn Close and the entire female population in town (led by Faith Hill). Kidman immediately figures out that something is way off, along with fellow newcomers Bette Midler and totally out-of-place gay man Roger Bart (of "Desperate Housewives" fame). The original film from the 1970s was not really much to write home about either, but this picture pales mightily just the same. "The Stepford Wives" is full of juvenile humor and sophomoric cinematic outcomes. Director Frank Oz' (sometimes a good film-maker and sometimes a total disappointment) picture is clunky, awkward and totally worthy of immediate entry to the theatrical junkyard. 2 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

But at the same time, there were a lot of questions and moments that seemed a little too silly. I especially thought the ending got to be a little too wacky. Though this is an A-list cast, that doesn't mean you are going to get a great film. I have discovered that these last two years.

		<fullReview>The movie never finds its stride - failing to ever determine if its a farce or a satire on modern gender posturing. The men are hapless fools who are lost and unable to find their purpose or place. The women have an even worse fate here - either they're the Stepford automatons or are miserable Superwomen who have driven themselves to the top of their professions and have to be torn down in order to restore their husband's sense of manhood - like Kidman's Broadcasting Executive (who ironically get's canned early on for being too over-the-top). The only woman who seems in the least genuine is Bette Midler - but even that's spoiled, imho, by her obvious misandry and her unlikely marriage to Jon Lovitz (I'd have forgiven that if the director had allowed Lovitz to be funny). So even Bette Midlers character, the enlightened Manhattan writer, is underneath just another castrating cliché of modern femininity.A pathetic movie, unfunny, disjointed and possibly Kidman's worst effort ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! If you ever want to see a GOOD movie, watch the 1974 version. It actually isn't bad at all.To appreciate this movie,the 2004 version, you have to take it in its historical context. When made George W. Bush is President and all of the talk is of a Republican Majority for years to come. So liberal Hollywood is angry beyond belief... and they are even more angry that with all of their subtle but deliberate attempts to manipulate political and social attitudes over many decades they are completely shut out of Washington.So this movie is made with NO attempts to be subtle and its nothing but a seething attack on white/Christian/middle class/heartland America which is blamed for voting Republican. Watch as the Hollywood constituency of Jews, Lesbians, and Feminists join together to stomp out the "evils" of the Republican Party allegorically represented by evil people turning women into robots.No doubt while many would be offended by the seething hatred of the movie makers towards a majority of Americans, I couldn't control myself laughing hysterically at the over the top attacks (which weren't meant to be funny) but somehow were. And it just got worse being in proximity of three teenaged girls too dumb to see how mad Hollywood was and who were actually getting mad at the over the top sexism of the imaginary town folk Hollywood was trying to lump in with Republicans.Watch the knitting scene... omigosh! how awful... women getting excited about celebrating Christmas when we all "know" they should be joining Rosie for a good bit of anti-male bashing lesbianism. And how important for the effeminate husband of Nicole Kidman to give up his career and ideas for a family so that she can slave herself for a corporate entity. Which is OF COURSE what Nicole Kidman's character should WANT to do with her life... no matter how corporately shallow and hollow.Truth is, unless you've learnt to laugh at the Hollywood Political machine this movie is awful unless you're fully and completely behind the Hollywood agenda that baffles even most American LIBERALS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strong indication of the times we live in, and not a good one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1975, a film adaptation of an Ira Levin novel called The Stepford Wives created an inescapable portrait of a realm in which mind control was no longer a painstaking science but simply replacing the original subject with a robotic clone. It is still frightening today, not just to women who might have things in common with its protagonist, but to individuals of all shades belonging to marginalised groups whom individuals with a less than noble agenda attempt to silence or put words into the mouths of. Which is partly what makes this lemon of a remake so insulting. Exactly where Frank Oz got the idea that mind control and identity erasure is a fit subject for comedy from, I doubt we will ever know, but he clearly did not pay nearly as much attention as he should have during his association with Jim Henson. However, a lot of warning signs that occurred before the film was completed may in fact suggest that Oz may not deserve all of the blame for this atrocity. For one thing, expecting a film to handle an adult subject like this in an adult manner is rather optimistic at the best of times.For another, the constant-rewrite culture of present-day Hollywood has ensured that the vision of the creative team behind the film will be subverted in favour of the whims of any ignorant fool in the audience. One scene in the men's club shown in this film practically announces that this is exactly what happened here. Other scenes pertaining to exactly what has been done to the women of Stepford in order to make them so malleable allude to a mind control chip that can be implanted in the brain and shorted out or otherwise made defective, much like a RAM chip. But this particular scene has one man swiping a card of some sort across his wife's head, and a bill being spat from her mouth. Apparently, audiences wanted an overtly happy ending, and Paramount did not give a damn about how logical the one they grafted onto the end of the film would appear. It isn't just the wives in this instance, Paramount literally wanted a Stepford audience.Any film with Bette Midler in it is going to be the subject of derision for her inability to play anyone other than herself, but she has never revealed exactly how non-divine she is quite like she has in The Stepford Wives. Her performance itself is nothing remarkable, much like the rest of her acting career. Rather, it is her talking to the press that really messed her up. Probably the most widely-circulated quote from her regarding The Stepford Wives is to the effect that this is what all men want from the women they associate with. Part of the horror that the original captured so well derives from the fact that real men would find such a compliant, obedient automaton repulsive. If you need any proof of this, ask yourself why there is a whole civil rights movement dedicated to having governments recognise the rights of certain neurodiverse individuals, man, woman, and child, to refuse to be given invasive brain surgery simply to make their behaviour more like that of John Typical. Apparently Midler has such a narrow mind that even skin colour does not make people different when they are masculine.Script and editing aside, quite probably the worst of the problems with The Stepford Wives circa 2004 was the support cast. After two of the Cusack siblings decided this project was not worth their time, Hollywood went to every star in the phonebook they could find. The results are somewhat mixed. The casting of Matthew Broderick in the lead male role sets up a great visual joke in which, after delivering a somewhat contrived speech to the superficial-level effect of what I have so far been saying about how automatons rarely make a worthwhile substitute for the real thing, the real-man status of the character is commented upon. It just makes it such a pity that very few actual men were involved either behind or in front of the camera. Christopher Walken apparently refused to finish the film without a happy ending. Midler went hog wild demanding her own modifications to the story. Frank Oz was unable to treat this creative idiocy in the manner it deserved. The result is a film that cannot make up its mind whether it is a comedy, a satire, a horror, or a Sweet Valley High novel. Calling the end result flat would be flattery.For this reason, and many others, I gave The Stepford Wives circa 2004 a two out of ten. The novel and the original adaptation were meant to be future-shock tales of what will happen if we allow the mind control we have begun to accept in our society to go too far. The 2004 version feels like the result of the minds behind the original being lobotomised, if that tells you anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How bad could it be?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BAD...really, really bad. We're talking "Spaceballs" bad. I wouldn't even begin to imagine remaking "The Stepford Wives" as a comedy. That was appalling, and twisted enough but then it's released in its present form for entertainment value?? This should be bombed out of existence, never to be seen or heard from again. Shame on everyone involved in this flop for actually taking money for this and running to their bank to deposit those huge Hollywood checks. We, the audience, should have been paid for our wasted time. What was I thinking, I could have been watching my grass grow or waiting for the phone to ring. At least that might have had some suspense involved!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sad mistake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One wonders why the rehash of old stories over and over again persists so that writers/producers/directors can put a camp bent on them. This is the case of the remake of the Stepford Wives in the hands of Frank Oz. If , perhaps, he had remade it with the Muppets it may have proven better material. As it is the acting or over-acting as the case is might as well have sprung from the small screen efforts of the Muppet Show. I was upset for the first time in my life for having paid full price to see this friends of Dorothy recreation of what was originally a thriller with respects to womens equality under attack. Poor Ira Levin, I don't think he had this in mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the worst I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First the good.... there are one or two moments in the movie that are so ridiculous and comical that they are worth a genuine chuckle.Now that I've got that out of the way, the rest of the movie is really really poor. The story makes no sense. It's as though the filmmakers changed their mind halfway through as to exactly how the story should be resolved, which in turn caused the filmmakers to contradict themselves on more than a few details. Apart from that, the movie simply isn't entertaining for any extended period of time. The whole thing is just a mess.Nicole Kidman continues to prove that she is perhaps the most overrated actress in terms of marketability. This isn't a critique on her talent, but she continues to get massive paychecks for roles she doesn't really fit, and her string of box office flops is growing to epic proportions. Compare the budgets vs. returns of her last several films. It's amazing.Anyway, if you want a good rental some evening, take whatever movie is on the shelf next to this version of the Stepford Wives. I guarantee you it will be better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun Version of The Stepford Wives but not a Laugh Out Riot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version of the Stepford Wives is played out for laughs unlike the novel or Original Stepford Wives movie in 1975.In this version Joanna Eberhart played by Nicole Kidman is a high powered TV mogul rather than a free lance photographer and she was born an Eberhart and kept her maiden name when she married Walter who's last name is Kresby.Eberhart put on one too many Alternative Programs on her network, and it almost gets her killed. However it costs her job, and she falls to pieces. Walter decides to move to Stepford in hopes of starting a new life.Eberhart is not crazy about being a stay at home wife and mother but she jumps into the role with two feet and makes the best out of it. Soon she meets the other women of Stepford and all their perfection.Something to note here Faith Hill plays Stepford wife Sarah Sunderson and is a mixture of Patricia Cornell and Carol Van Sant in this movie.Soon enough Eberhart runs into not only into Bobbie Markowitz (Bette Midler) but also Roger Bannister (Roger Bart) who is Gay and moved into Stepford with his partner. Bart is the feminine one so he bonds with Joanna and Bobbie. Meanwhile at the Men's Assocation you see the men, act more like boys with their toys (no foolin) rather than the workaholic held back men in the 75 version.Because Bart acts like a woman he is the first of the three to be Stepfordtized and he becomes this Social Conservtive type after the change. Soon enough Bobbie gets the Stepford treatment and we see the recreation of the scenes of Joanna's face off at the men's association, but this face it have a feel of a boys club occult ceremony mixed in with a little Frankenstein on the table as Joanna sees her "replacement." You then see the recreation of the Grocery Store scene which wraps up the 75 version but in this version the movie it does not end their.The climax is a ballroom dancing night and Walter sets things in motion that helps the Stepford Wives get the upper hand, but it also reveals a few surprises in which everyone gets the shock of their life, and leads to a commentary that goes beyond 1970's women's lib (which was the basis of The Stepford Wives). Rather a statement is made on how life in America has changed but not all for the better. Some of that is seen early in the film including Eberhart's love for black clothing, which respects the "working woman", and the open titles in which you see film clips of 1950's housewives.If you plan on seeing this film you may want to see the original 75 version first. You might be able to appreciate this version afterwords, and if not you can see how they play and complement (or tries to) each other.CNN's Larry King and Meredith Vieira (The View and Millionaire) have cameos in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A huge mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Word was leaked early that this film was a disaster. Test screenings went miserably and the ending had to be re-filmed. It sat on the shelves for close to a year. Nicole Kidman said nasty things about director Frank Oz behind his back, and the cast and crew in turn said things about her. Matthew Broderick said it was one of his worst filming experiences of his career.And then the movie came out and flopped. It deserved to. It's a huge mess - an uninspired, silly, over-the-top, stupid, insulting, smug, self-conscious little "comedy" that is too nice to be dark and too dark to be nice.The first half is pretty clever and I found it amusing. Nicole Kidman has a nervous breakdown and moves out of the city with her husband (Broderick) to get away from the chaos. Once there they find a home in a small community named Stepford, begun by a local millionaire (Christopher Walken).She makes some friends with neighbors Jon Lovitz and Bette Midler, but soon realizes the local "perfect wives" are indeed just that - and may in fact be robots.The movie tries to be a satire of our repression of women's rights and so on and so forth. It tries to criticize the lustful sexual appetite of men and say that women are more than just bodies. They have souls and feelings and emotions.But this is a simple point and even by today's standards it's outdated itself - this was far more prescient back in the '50s and '60s when the original took place. Nowadays it seems redundant and smug.The ending is where it all falls apart - it was obviously reshot to be "happier" and you can even tell because Nicole Kidman's hair is completely different at the end of the movie, which implies she was brought back months later for the re-shoot.It's a horrible little film that is instantly forgettable and annoying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give Me A Break!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I know this was only filmed a couple of years ago. They progressed Stepford by having a white gay couple but you are telling me that the perfect world of Stepford is lily white. I mean if you can have a gay couple, you can't have an African American couple and Hispanic couple in Stepford. This is 2004. As for the remake, this movie is a comedy. The first movie version at least had the effort to make it a thriller. I love Roger Bart as the gay husband/wife but it's redundant for him. After all, when he's cast as straight like George Williams on Desperate HOusewives, he becomes a homicidal maniac obsessed with Bree. Nicole Kidman is good in the role that Katharine Ross made famous. Bette Midler is always welcome although not on film sets because of her difficult behavior. I love the casting of JOn Lovitz as her husband, John Malkovich and Glenn Close as the all too perfect Stepford couple. The movie is entertaining but it's 30 years later, times have changed. I guess the message is that it's changed for gays but not for African Americans or Hispanics in this country.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies I've ever seen...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have only been a handful of movies I have ever seen that I wanted to walk out on or stop. This was one of them. The inconsistencies were those that even Hollywoodland can't even get away with. The script was terrible. It was a comedy that wasn't funny. It was a suspense that wasn't suspenseful. It was a sci-fi that was neither cheesy enough to be comedic or creepy enough to give me the creeps.. That and, being gay, I was appalled at all the "let's laugh at the faggot!" jokes throughout. Done tastefully, I don't usually mind, but this wasn't done tastefully. I am not knocking the actors at all. They all performed up to the standard I had in my head for them, it was direction and scripting. I was really looking forward to this movie. I'm sorry I spent $6.25 on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE STEPFORD WIVES (2004) ** Nicole Kidman, Matthew Broderick, Bette Midler, Glenn Close, Christopher Walken, Roger Bart, David Marshall Grant, Jon Lovitz, Faith Hill. Flat and uninspired re-imagining of Ira Levin's social horror film this time as a comedy misfires on practically all accounts with Kidman as a type-A TV exec recently fired and post-breakdown is talked into a new start by her well-meaning husband Broderick to the strangely bucolic town of Stepford, Connecticut where things are not-as-they-seem. Paul Rudnick's stale zingers-laden screenplay adaptation lofts softball jokes at a stale premise that is sadly dated and if no one knows by now that the women are robots well wake up and smell the coffee people.

		<shortDescription>Worse than I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a confession to make. I wasn't very excited about seeing this movie. Nothing about it really grabbed my interest. But I decided to watch it with an open mind and give it a fair chance to win me over. After seeing it, I must admit that it far exceeded my expectations ... OF CRAPPINESS!!!Unbelievable. This movie does nothing but leave me with several questions: Why was it made? Seriously, what is the point of the movie? Social commentary? Let me see, there's no such thing as a perfect world, right? There, I just summed it up for you and saved you the price of a movie ticket. No need to thank me.What was Nicole Kidman thinking? Did she read the script before she signed on? It's one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen on the big screen, and folks, I've seen a LOT of movies on the big screen. Everything about it is just very, very lame. It's one of those movies where you're embarrassed for everybody on screen, and you're embarrassed to be in the audience. It's hard to know what to say because I'm just baffled by the whole thing.Even more baffling is that a lot of the audience was laughing during the movie. AT WHAT?!?!?! What, pray tell, is so funny about lines such as "I didn't marry something from Radio Shack"? NOTHING! So why was the audience laughing?? What's so funny about a CGI robot dog falling down the stairs? NOTHING! So why did I hear some guy laughing so hard that I thought for sure he was coughing up a whole Auntie Anne soft pretzel? I don't get it.Story wise, this movie is all over the place. Does it want to be a comedy? Well, it fails because I refuse to laugh at Bette Midler wearing fake antlers. I heard it was supposed to be somewhat of a dark comedy, but it's nowhere near edgy enough to qualify. In fact, it's nowhere near the edge of anything. It's resting comfortably in a barcalounger in Topeka, KS. Sorry, but mocking reality television just doesn't cut it anymore.Is it supposed to be an emotional drama? There were some long stretches of Nicole Kidman and Matthew Broderick sharing their feelings, but the only emotion I was feeling was one of sheer sadness because I realized valuable moments of my life were flittering away, never to be seen again. Wow, Kidman loves Broderick because of a dance he does when he wins computer chess. Where's a remote when you need it? Seriously, I had not one iota of interest in a single character.I guess in the case of fairness, I should point out that I don't like Glenn Close, Matthew Broderick, or Bette Midler, and this movie only reminded me why. Glenn Close was absolutely annoying (especially in the totally unfunny exercise scene), and, I'm not *trying* to be mean, but she looked like a witch. I suppose women over the age of 50 might laugh at Close swiveling her hips and singing "chooga chooga chooga," but I failed to crack a smile.Bette Midler (who I initially mistook for Whoopi Goldberg) did nothing but make me pray for her character's imminent death. So she fancies herself a "Jew with an attitude" who writes books about her mother called, "I Love You, But Please Die"? If y'all will excuse me, I've gotta go see a doctor to tend to my busted gut. Let me try to make this perfectly clear. There is one scene where Nicole Kidman is about to catch on that some of the women are robots (which is a major plot hole when compared to the tagged-on-at-the-last-second ending) and makes a comment about how sparks were coming out of her ears. Bette Midler replies, and I'm paraphrasing, "That's a sure sign of bad jewelry." The audience howled with laughter. I sighed, shook my head, and asked God why He was doing this to me. Which reaction do you more relate to? Use that as a guide to decide whether or not to see the movie.And Matthew Broderick? Well, he continued his transformation into Jerry Mathers and offered no sign that he has an ounce of coolness or testosterone in him. So basically, he's been typecast. Even Christopher "I'll Appear in Any Crap I'm Paid For These Days" Walken didn't do anything of note except make you think to yourself, "Kangaroo Jack, Gigli, and now this? Ouch."I've never seen the original movie, and I'm really not moving mountains to clear my schedule to do that, but I heard it was a thriller. It appears this movie makes a stab at providing a few thrills, but it just doesn't work. Is the audience actually supposed to think it's a big mystery as to what's going on in town? Are we actually supposed to be surprised at the "twist" near the end of the movie? I don't know. There isn't anything shocking or surprising about the movie, but it sure feels like we're supposed to think there is.Welp, I've wasted enough of my life dwelling on this. If I had to do it all over again, then I'd choose not to see it. Not even for free. I thought it was equally as bad as (and maybe even worse than) last year's "Legally Blonde 2."If you wanna yell and scream at me for blasting this movie, then go ahead. I'm sure it'll have a fan base. For some reason, Bette Midler has a fan base, so I have no doubt this movie will as well. But it sure doesn't include anybody by the name of Johnny Betts. And if it does, then I'm gonna ask him to change his name.</fullReview>
