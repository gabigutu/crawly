		<shortDescription>Out of this World entertainment from R. Corman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Corman's most unusual and entertaining features from the 50s. Rubber monsters are totally extraneous to the menace of (the excellent) Paul Birch as the sunglass-wearing alien from Davana who puts a scare in sexy nurse Beverly Garland! Bev hams it up in a slick one-piece for John Haze's amusement and Dick Miller drops by in an excellent bit as a VERY annoying vacuum salesman. The audience mightn't have minded when he died, and here is one of the earliest examples of Corman's very influential use of comedy/horror. Very good script was adapted almost word for word in some scenes for the 80s version -- a tribute to Griffith's skill as a writer of such glib dialogue. A bit more effective production would have helped, but we all know how Corman likes to pinch a penny.This is a truly great, almost unknown B-movie -- why doesn't someone get their hands on a print and put it out on DVD and video again? I had to go to the best video store in San Francisco to find it anywhere in the whole bay area. I don't think it's currently in circulation, and it's very hard to find a copy. Thus, not many people know about the original version of this great flick (which features vampire blood fetishism in the context of alien invaders! I mean, how could you go wrong?). The remake was good, but not as good as the original. I think Allied distributed this for Corman, so there should be prints floating around somewhere, so let's hope a nice one pops up on DVD soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bizarre! But when was Roger Corman anything else?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to hand it to Roger Corman, he could not only stretch a dollar but our imaginations as well. In this one he put character actor Paul Birch in a black suit, stark white contact lenses and sunglasses. He's playing a blind man, right? Wrong! He's playing a space alien and if you look at his pupil-less eyes your brain burns right in your skull (could this be where David Cronenberg got the idea for SCANNERS?). Anyway, Birch has come to our world looking for blood. His own planet is worn out due to years of atomic war and only the uncontaminated blood of Earth people can save what is left of his race. Birch's superior intellect has made him extremely arrogant (he refers to Earthlings as "subhuman") yet his unfamiliarity with the simplest things on this world continually attracts attention to himself. He makes no attempt to cover his many killings, leaving bodies where they can easily be discovered. His contempt for Earth and its people mirrors that of THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD who brutally knocked Dr. Carrington aside when he dared to compare his feeble Earth brain to that of the alien. Also in the cast are Beverly Garland as the nurse who knows her patient is unusual but does not realise how much. Jonathan Haze as the former petty crook who is his chauffeur (Haze's last line is a classic!). Morgan Jones, the former "Green Hornet" in the 1940 Universal serial, is the cop in love with Garland who labels Birch "a creep"; and Dick Miller is a vacuum cleaner salesman who deserves some sort of award for using the word "purchase" the most times in a single sentence. Oh yes, there is a monster too, sort of. A briefly seen what-is-it designed by Paul Blaisdell that looks like an inverted umbrella. It kills the one person on Earth who knows who and what Birch really is and then (apparently) dies. Talk about thrifty, that isn't blood at the end of that scene, the actor who appears to have his head crushed by the monster just had a mouth full of grape juice and spit it out at the right moment. Roger has remade this film twice (what, will he keep doing it until he gets it right?) but the original is still the most fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early Corman Classic, remade but never equalled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An alien vampire, with blank eyes, who usually wears sun glasses and business suit, (shades of Carpenter's They Live) needs blood injections to stay alive and send some lower class specimens of earth life to his home planet via his matter transformation machine.Oh it's all great fun with a Corman who's who cast that includes the future star of Little Shop of Horror Jonathan Haze, the future star of Bucket of Blood, Dick Miller, the future ex girlfriend of Corman Beverly Garland, and Paul Birch as the dapper alien. The special effects are by the reliable Paul Blaisdell.The film was originally co-billed with Attack of the Crab Monsters.Campy, fun from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great sci-fi gem from director Roger Corman! A man wearing dark glasses goes to a doctor and asks for a blood transfusion. From that point on, suspense builds as we go with Beverly Garland as she assumes the job of a live-in nurse to this "strange" man with the glasses. The man is no man at all, rather an alien presence studying earth and its inhabitants to see if his species can live on earth with human blood as a nourishing factor. The alien man is frightening in manner, abilities, and his coldness to seemingly everything. Paul Birch does an outstanding job playing Mr. Johnson. Garland is superb as the heroine and Jonathan Haze does a fine job as another curious household servant. Corman builds a great deal of suspense from a pretty good script. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great classic 1950's sci-fi at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually went to see "Attack of the Crab Monsters" but this was much better. The entire movie had a dark quality to it, like you were looking thru Paul birch's very cool wraparound shades (or maybe the theater needed a new projection bulb/ carbon arc light- no, "Crab Monsters" was OK..) The bat creature, as I remember it, was like a small webbed-between-it's-tentacles octopus that did an amazing skull crush. I was usually inured to a lot of those creatures, but I had nightmares for days after that thing. Beverly Garland always added to any movie, and I think from her output of films, she just lived on the sets. So where is it, Roger!!! We want to see it, and I don't think it's ever been on tape or dvd</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast moving, wild Corman classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Corman's very best is this 1957 gem which originally was double billed with the enjoyable Attack of the Crab Monster. Paul Birch is the blank eyed vampire from another planet who wears cool wrap-around shades and dressed in a black business suit. Carpenter drew inspiration from here for They Live. He sends specimens of humans to his planet for further study like vacuum cleaner Dick Miller, hires a suspicious chauffeur (Jonathan Haze--who is remembered best from Little Shop of Horrors), hires an unsuspecting nurse (beverly garland)to give him blood transfusions, and still has time to play around as a flying head crushing bat creature. The special effects are courtesy of the very talented Paul Blaisdell (She Creature, Saucer Men and more). It's been remade a few times.. but nothing comes close to the original. Campy fun!! Highly recommended. And only a little over an hour long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best movie on Earth, but OK for what it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I judge Corman movies by a different set of standards than I would a bigger budget effort such as "This Island Earth" or "The Day The Earth Stood Still" or even "Earth Vs The Flying Saucers". That's because this obviously sketchy 10-day wonder still has lots of rough edges and some of the seams are still leaking sawdust...but manages to entertain and amuse almost as well as those class "A" efforts.As usual, the screenplay has a derivative but somewhat intriguing premise: a space vampire with a basilisk stare scouts for a fresh blood supply for his home planet and kills, oh, a bunch of people to keep himself going and to send samples back to his home planet. Not the stuff of Oscar winners, but enough to drive a perfectly watchable science fiction movie.The cast is pretty good (in a "B" movie way), and they work really hard to make the ludicrous and stiff dialog work. Beverly Garland is always fun to watch (even in her early movies, she still has a lot of verve and moxie) and Paul Birch is perfectly cast for the part of the alien. He was born to wear wrap around sunglasses and act stiff and grumpy and vaguely menacing. (I've read that he hated working with Corman in this movie and actually quit before it was finished, making it necessary to use a stand-in double for some of the chase scenes.) On the other hand...the "police department" is two people (except for a spear carrier who shows up on screen and is killed inside of 2 minutes), the "hospital" is obviously a sound stage with 2 doors, the "monster" is a tentacled umbrella/catcher's mitt thing, the plot makes no real sense (one scene with Dick Miller is obviously there strictly for laughs) and the action scenes looks as if they were shot in 10 minutes with a hand-held 8 millimeter.Joe Queenan once made a movie (to prove it could be done by anyone), and he said at one point when it was near completion, it was a "movie" in the same sense that a hand typed manuscript with a crayon drawing of an Axe-murderer on the front was a "suspense novel". Well, that's what always comes to mind when I'm watching a Corman movie - the elements are there, but the polish and finish of a "real" movie are never put over the nuts and bolts to make it look like something you'd admire.Still, they kept things moving and there was even a bit of thought and sympathy at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this in the early 1970's on Bob Wilkins' Creature Feature on Channel Two from Oakland. A good movie with a dark, scary atmosphere.The part I found most unnerving was where the alien takes his sun glasses off, looks at a passing passenger aircraft with his "Man With The X-Ray Eyes" type eyes, causing the aircraft to explode in mid-air, killing all aboard.I notice that it is not available on DVD or VHS. Too bad. Hope it is released soon.If anyone knows where I can get a copy of this on DVD/Laser Disc/ or VHS, please let me know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Mini-Classic from Roger Corman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ultra-creative Roger Corman directed quite a few horror and sci-fi movies in the late 1950s and early 1960s. They almost all had low budgets, short running times, lots of action and plots that moved like lightning. Some were duds (just see "Viking Women and the Sea Serpent") but many were pretty good. "Not of This Earth" is one of the best Corman films from this period, with a great cast, good script and fine direction.A white-eyed alien named Paul Johnson (Paul Birch) comes to earth in order to collect human blood for his home planet Davanna, which is experiencing a horrible war. Johnson's eyes emit some kind of lethal powers when he takes off his sunglasses. He is hires nurse Nadine Storey (Beverly Garland), who administers blood transfusions and a personal assistant Jeremy (Jonathan Haze). He communicates with his leader and sends blood home via a matter transmitter. He is defeated at the end by Storey's boyfriend, a policeman who discovers that the alien cannot tolerate loud noises (such as police sirens). Along the way, there's an interesting subplot about the arrival of a female alien (Anna Lee Carroll) from Davanna, and some unusual blood research by a local doctor (William Roerick).Birch is just excellent in the title role, playing a menacing, sunglasses-wearing alien with great flair and restraint. Garland, as the threatened heroine, is good as usual and her role gives her plenty of opportunities to scream. The best performance is provided by Dick Miller, who hilariously plays an over-aggressive vacuum cleaner salesman who unwisely conducts a demonstration in the alien's basement. The demonstration is followed by footage of the salesman's blood being drained and his body being stuffed into an incinerator. (This was a clever touch by Corman?how many times have we all been annoyed by door-to-door solicitors? I'm not endorsing incinerating anyone, but the scene was amusing.) Corman's direction and the fine cast set "Not of This Earth" apart from lots of other sci-fi B-movies of the late 1950s. If you like these kinds of films, it's really fun to watch and it moves at warp speed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a strange sci-fi classic this is. A dying alien, (Paul Birch wearing sunglasses that make him look evil.) is feasting on assorted Los Angeles citizens. It's up to his nurse (the pretty Beverly Garland) to prevent his rampage, or jst simply escape his clutches. The alien is first viewed as an evil beng, but we begin to feel pity for this exile from a dying planet. Corman regulars Dick Miller ("No flipflops, please...") and Jonathan Haze round out the cast. The film was remade in 1988 with Traci Lords as the nurse. For the sake of the story, this was a shame, because Lords' tough little kitten persona didn't wash as a nurse. Beverly Garland gave the part a real warmth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imaginative, witty, bizarre and fast-paced low-budget sci-fi/horror flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunglasses-sporting Paul Johnson (Paul Birch) stops in at a clinic one afternoon and demands an immediate blood transfusion, and he doesn't seem too concerned about pesky things like blood type, RH factors and other peculiarities getting in his way of obtaining his blood. After slitting his own wrist to show he's tapped out and using his telepathic abilities to put Dr. Rochelle (William Roerick) under a trance, Mr. Johnson not only gets the red stuff he wanted but also the employ of the doctor's nurse Nadine Story (Beverly Garland, who had just appeared in Corman's hit IT CONQUERED THE WORLD a year earlier). Nadine is sent off to live in Johnson's home so she can administer daily blood transfusions and finally comes to the realization that her new patient is, well, not of this Earth! Mr. Johnson is actually a black-eyed alien being from the planet of Davanna, where the population is so exposed to nuclear war that their blood has begun to evaporate. He's on Earth to harvest blood from unwilling donors using a special pump with clear tubes and then sends it, as well as live human specimens, back to his home planet through a special portal. Not only adept at mind control, Johnson can make anyone drop dead with direct eye contact. Also living in the home is a small time crook/punk named Jeremy (LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS star Jonathan Haze), who acts as chauffeur, security and errand boy. Jeremy takes an instant liking to Nadine, though she's already seeing motorcycle cop Harry (Morgan Jones), and the two team up to try to find out what's up with their strange new employer.Corman does his usual workman-like job here; making the most of a low budget from the first frame to the last. The screenplay by Charles B. Griffith and Mark Hanna is wonderfully imaginative; full of interesting ideas and concepts that don't need a huge budget to pull off. It also has its share of amusing, sometimes hilariously droll one-liners. The casting is also terrific. Birch is amusingly and appropriately one-note as the seemingly emotionless alien being, Garland is a plucky and enthusiastic heroine and all of the other principal actors deliver competent performances. "Richard" (Dick) Miller even gets a funny cameo as an ill-fated door-to-door vacuum cleaner salesman who ends up in the downstairs furnace. Special effects man Paul Blaisdell contributes a bloodsucking umbrella monster to the proceedings, but it only gets to appear in one scene. All in all, this is a clever, breezy, humorous and highly enjoyable way to spend an hour of your time. Unfortunately, it's never officially been released to video or DVD to my knowledge (at least in America) and is hard to track down nowadays. Hopefully one day it will get a decent release and build up a strong cult reputation like it deserves. Corman himself served as producer on at least three color remakes that followed years later. The first was made in 1988 by Jim Wynorski and received a lot of publicity at the time because it starred Traci Lords (then in the news for the whole underage porn scandal) in her "legit" acting debut. It's basically the same exact story, most of the same exact lines and the same lead characters, with the added attraction of frequent nudity. The other remakes, in 1995 (starring Michael York) and 1998 (with a female - Athena Massey - in the alien role), were made for cable television.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent 50's sci-fi outing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Entertaining story that holds together, takes you in and holds up today. Good atmosphere and b/w photography. Good acting. Paul Birch, usually a supporting actor, has the lead, closely followed by Beverly Garland of Alligator People fame as well as It Conquered the World in the sci-fi genre. Birch is someone whose face and an excellent baritone voice old movie fans will recognize, even if the name conjures up nothing. He was an admiral in the 27th Day and quite often played authority figures. Here he is an alien on a mission to save his planet, but to do that he needs blood. He has a refrigerator full of it, as did Darren McGavin's vampire nemesis 15 years later in The Night Stalker.Along the way there is plenty to hold one's attention and interest. This movie is definitely not camp or campy. It survives and entertains for what it is.What knocks the rating down is that it has obviously low production values, has some acting and/or characters that are bland, annoying or grating, and has some looseness to the story. It has no deep themes and does not arouse deep feelings either. It is an imaginative amusement whose good touches outweigh these issues. But to be transported by such a movie as this, one may have to be somewhat accustomed to the style and look of the 50s movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Earth is in trouble. On the planet known as Davana, good fresh blood from subhuman earthlings is in high demand, so whatever you do, don't look at the collector's eyes. Poof?.there goes your brain, burnt to a crisp. You have been "dispatched" and shortly after, you "donate" your blood to his nifty body-draining siphon-in-a-brief-case. The collector has his own blood issues but with the help of his snoopy thug chauffeur he is able to motor around in a black 1957 Cad to get help from nurse Garland and do a little research in the local library. No need to worry about his ability to control people with mental telepathy, nor should you be concerned about that hi-tech dimensional warp cleverly disguised as his closet, the crematory and blood bank in the basement, or the ultra creepy floating bat thing with deformed antenna and a dome like skirt that he lets out of a glass tube to float through your window, envelope your head and do unspeakable things to your helpless noggin. Before we all become blood donors for Davana's red cross, will we discover the collector's Achilles Heel in time to save nurse Beverly from a one way trip through the dimensional warp? The answer is not of this earth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Evil, blood-sucking alien (like there's another kind in Corman's universe?) Paul Birch is draining the citizenry of L.A. to save not only himself but the dying planet Davanna in this creepy Corman classic. When nurse Bev Garland and her not-too-imaginative cop boyfriend discover what Birch is up to, the fun really gets going: foot chases, car chases, fiery crashes - in short, the works. Even though there's something for almost everybody in this little gem (except spaceships; sorry, all you hardware freaks), "Not of this Earth" remains one of the very few Corman films that has never been released on either VHS or DVD. Supposedly, the reason for this is that Corman himself wasn't satisfied with the finished product; hence, at least two remakes, or, three if you count the stupendously awful "Star Portal." As is typical in Corman films, the budget was very tiny; so tiny, in fact, that the only piece of the original, lavish "dimensional warp chamber" to survive fiscal reality was the multi-orbed thingamajig at the very top of the otherwise spartan black chamber. Too bad. The word is that the original design by Paul Blaisdell was pretty impressive. Well, for a low-budget B/W 1957 thriller, anyway. So, while a lot of money does not necessarily a hit film make (witness "Alexander"), it doesn't really hurt, either. Bottom line: don't pay too much attention to the, er, lean FX, such as the deadly lampshade bug. The story isn't bad, the acting is, for the most part, okay (although the three bums are laughable), and you actually feel some pity toward the end for Birch and his ilk. If you can find this one, go for it. Believe us, there's A LOT worse out there</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT OF THIS EARTH (Roger Corman, 1957) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having caught most of horror legend Corman&#x2019;s more respectable early genre efforts &#x2013; THE UNDEAD (1957), A BUCKET OF BLOOD (1959) and THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS (1960) &#x2013; I had been aching to check this one out being, by all accounts, the most elusive of the bunch. Having now watched the film on the very same day I acquired it says a lot about my love of fantasy films &#x2013; when many a renowned mainstream (and, for all intents and purposes, desirable) title still languishes in my collection and which, sometimes, I&#x2019;ve owned for a good many years already... Anyway, going back to that opening statement about Corman&#x2019;s pre-color/Edgar Allan Poe output, NOT OF THE THIS EARTH emerges to be fully deserving of its considerable reputation; indeed, I&#x2019;d say it&#x2019;s probably the most satisfying of the four films mentioned above: the others had a tongue-in-cheek, even campy approach &#x2013; present here only in some amusingly dated jive talk from the youngsters and a goofy mushroom-like floating object used at one point to dispatch a prominent character &#x2013; whereas this is quite straightforward, and as stark and unrelenting as they come! Besides, the typical alien invasion theme here is ingeniously augmented by the topical concern of paranoia found in Charles B. Griffith and Mark Hanna&#x2019;s intelligent script, via its allusions to Nuclear War (the fictional world from which the alien emanates, Davana, is succumbing to interplanetary war a' la THIS ISLAND EARTH [1955]&#x2019;s Metaluna) and The Red Menace (hypnotized by the extraterrestrial creature, the human victims&#x2019; subsequent devotion to his cause is comparable to the emotionless doppelgangers from INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS [1956]); apart from this, the alien&#x2019;s modus operandi &#x2013; draining Earthlings of their blood &#x2013; presents the film with a nice twist on the vampire myth! Incidentally, he uses the closet of his bedroom as a teleportation/communication machine between the two worlds, requires to wear sunglasses at all times (because one look into his creepy blank eyes can kill), but is himself vulnerable to loud noises (which proves to be his undoing in the climactic chase). Eventually, a second (female) visitor from outer-space arrives on the scene &#x2013; but dies shortly thereafter, having unwittingly received a transfusion of infected blood! The film concludes, then, on a satisfactorily ironic note.Despite the obviously modest budget at hand, the director has assembled a more than adequate cast to fill the main roles: Paul Birch is impressive and memorable as the &#x2018;unearthly stranger&#x2019;; Beverly Garland makes for one of the most engaging heroines in this type of film; Jonathan Haze&#x2019;s character as Birch&#x2019;s lackey is miles removed from his signature role of the geeky florist in THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS; Corman stalwart and cult favorite Dick Miller has a delightful bit as a hip but ill-fated vacuum-cleaner salesman. By the way, the atmospheric cinematography (evident even in the poor-quality 16mm print I watched) is by John Mescall &#x2013; who, years before, had been responsible for nothing less than BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1935)! Finally, it&#x2019;s worth noting that NOT OF THIS EARTH was twice remade to much lesser effect &#x2013; first in 1988 and again in 1995; curiously enough, on both of these, Corman himself would serve as executive producer!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Corman Classic !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Or another nice summary, might be "Blood donors needed at Mr. Johnson's house"! One of Corman's finest! Directed by prolific director Roger Corman, Corman rises above the low budget and creates a classic! This is a very enjoyable science fiction horror thriller! I first seen it when I was very young boy a long time ago. I like it and all my friends liked it! A nice intelligently imaginative script from writers Charles B. Griffith and Mark Hanna. Corman directed it at a rapid pace and it works! The plot moves quick and does not become stagnate! The whole cast is excellent.Perfectly cast as Mr. Johnson is Paul Birch! He is a vampire like alien from outer space, he needs human blood to survive! He is from a dying planet called Davanna, basically he is a scout sent to earth to prepare the way for his planet's take over! Mr. Johnson has to wear dark sunglasses to hide his eyes which are white and have no pupils! He also has the ability to incinerate a human's brains by merely taking off his sun glasses, and looking into their eyes! Not the kind of guy you want as a friend! At the beginning we see Birch's first victim the cute actress Gail Ganley. He also has a nice teleportation machine in his living room, which he uses to transport human specimens back to his planet Davanna. Birch wears a sporty wide brim black fedora and Brooks Brother's suit with black sun glasses. Beautiful actress Beverly Garland is nurse Nadine, who gives Mr. Johnson daily blood transfusion, so she lives in his house. Slowly but surely she starts to suspect Mr. Johnson of being a little "different"!! Garland is a wonderful actress, I always enjoyed her acting she has a magnificent intensity! She helps to make this film a pleasure. Also in the cast is another talented actor Jonathan Haze (The Little Shop Of Horrors)(Teenage Caveman) formally from Pittsburgh PA.,Haze worked for Corman in many films. Haze plays Mr. Johnson's chauffeur Jeremy, together Nadine and Jeremy start to become a sort of a detective team as they start finding out different strange events about Mr. Johnson. A nice large old house is used for interior shots and adds to the bizarre dark atmosphere! Also in the film, is actor Dick Miller, another Corman regular, who is a more than a capable actor who does another fine job in this role! He adds a nice comedic touch to the film as a vacuum cleaner salesman, who unwittingly becomes another "blood donor" for Mr. Johnson! His body ends up in the cellar furnace! As the doctor that Nadine works for, doctor Rochelle (William Rodrick) he also suspects something is amiss too! So he is dispersed by Mr. Johnson! In what is a eerie bizarre moody scene, we see a umbrella like alien monster that flies or floats through a open window,and goes over the head of Mr. Johnson's adversary, Dr. Rochelle's head! It then proceeds to dissipate his head, then we see blood running down onto the table, fairly gruesome stuff for that period! The unique looking monster was designed by the highly talented Paul Blaisdell! In the meantime Beverly's boyfriend Morgan Jones, as officer Sherbourne is also investigating Johnson. A alien woman goes through the teleportation machine and arrives at Johnson's house, she tells him she needs blood. He breaks into a blood blank and gets "rabid" blood! Towards the end we see Johnson in his car chasing Nadine trying to catch her and trying to rid her of her brains! This is a great memorable scene, as she is running very fast for her life, and he is chasing her in the car you can hear him calling out to her telepathically, now its been a while since I seen the movie so I might be incorrect on some of the words but it is definitely a classic! He cries out, Nadine! Nadine! "Look at my eyes they are alien-n-n-n-n!!" In fact me and a old friend sometimes use to say the line out loud for a long time after we seen the film! You got to like this film, what fun! It was released by Allied Artists who also was the old Monogram Pictures, Allied Artists released a lot of fine gems during this period including (The Indestructible Man) (Attack Of The Crab Monsters)( The Attack Of The Fifty Foot Woman) (The Wasp Woman) and many others.I always enjoyed the word monologues at the beginning of these Allied Artist films some where I heard that these were not in the original prints but were added on later when Allied sold the movies to television in the 1960s? I got a video tape of it a while back, and the print was very very dark, are there any excellent prints out there on video tape? This film like John Agar's (Hand Of Death) is a hard film to find on video tape, I would love to have one! My hats off to Roger Corman and all concerned on making a excellent film, most highly recommended!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching THE BEAST WITH A MILLION EYES, one can't help but feel for the star, Paul Birch: he's given very little to do and he does very little with what he's given... The fact that the "beast" of the title looks like an old-fashioned coffee pot doesn't help. NOT OF THIS EARTH, however, restores one's faith in Birch: he's excellent as the leader of a race of vampire aliens come to Earth in search of- you guessed it- Human blood. The cataract-white contacts he wears throughout are most effective, lending his character that Otherworldly aspect so necessary for an "alien" to come across as other than Human; even when he's wearing his sunglasses to hide said orbs, he's convincingly alien. Dick Miller makes a brief appearance as a vacuum-cleaner salesman, but it's the beautiful Beverly Garland who steals the show as Birch's Earthling nurse. NOT OF THIS EARTH is another of those genuinely FUN Creature Features from the '50's- The Golden Age of Science Fiction Films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bizarre follow up to it conquered the world lacks in that cult classic delicious humor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>wild it certainly great to see Beverly garland back after facing the giant turn up like creature from it conquered the world, what she's missing here is the fun of that bizarre film released the previous year. She's gone from being cynical tough girl to a very friendly nurse, and here her only chances to emote is when she walks around almost in shock after a confrontation with the obvious creature from outer space, here seen in human form with sunglasses hiding eyes that's send men into shock and to their instant death.Certainly the ugly creature from It conquered the World needed some sort of follow-up, and here there is a miniature version of the same creature, one that like the little bit like creatures that flew out of that monsters behind. This one looks closer does the giant turn up then those weird looking flying creatures from the earlier film. It conquered the world thrives on it's delicious tongue in cheek and the cob sense of humor. However there really is very little to laugh at here, and when the monster does show up, it only makes a very brief appearance which is very disappointing considering what you would expect from Roger Corman. Garland still beautiful, and she does her best to add amusement with her lighthearted performance. The plot line is negligible, mostly talk and innocent bystanders being confronted by the aliens eyes after the sunglasses are removed, so any attempt at fright is more psychological then genuinely horrific.When Garland is eventually manipulated by her boss who happens to be a creature from outer space in human form, the tension does arise briefly. The scene where the little rubber flying thing does attack a victim is truly frightening. However there seems to be no explanation as to what happened to the cameo of this bizarre looking creature, and everything is wrapped up too quickly and neatly.the performances are all sincere, but the script is too chatty and truly has very little action to move it along. As result it is a slight for and ultimately that makes its a major disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roger Corman "classic" cheapie about a blank-eyed alien (Paul Birch) who comes to Earth because his planet Davanna is in desperate need of blood after a nuclear war. So he uses his mind control powers to force a doctor to give him a blood transfusion to keep him alive while he kills people and sends their blood back to his planet via some kind of transporter.Paul Birch is good in the lead role, despite reportedly feeling this movie was beneath him. Beverly Garland plays the nurse Birch's character hires to take care of him. I'm not sure why he didn't just mind control her, too. It would've saved him a lot of grief later. Jonathan Haze (Seymour from Little Shop of Horrors and other Corman movies) is the lowlife Birch hires as his driver. This type of character (dark hair, rough manner, vaguely Brooklyn) appeared in many Corman movies, for some reason. Another Corman regular, Dick Miller, has an amusing role as an annoying vacuum cleaner salesman who becomes Birch's first victim. Best part? Could be the doctor's hilarious death scene or the part where Birch tries his mind control powers on a guy but, because he's weak, it doesn't work as well so the guy runs away from him and you get a funny telepathic exchange between the two. But maybe the highlight is when another alien from Davanna shows up and demands Birch give her a blood transfusion. He does but he accidentally gives her some human blood infected with rabies! They don't make 'em like this anymore, folks. From the opening crawl to the closing scene, this is one of those great old sci-fi/horror flicks that has some interesting ideas but is so cheesy it's hard to take seriously. The cheesiness is what makes it so special, though. Love the sci-fi gadgetry, such as the machine Birch uses to communicate with another alien back on Davanna. It's all very low budget and cheap but also undeniably enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank You, Roger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As cheap and cheesy as this is, it is pretty captivating and has some wonderful characters. Some aliens from a dying planet are teleported to earth to find blood. They have the ability to look into the eyes of a person and drop them to the ground. They then remove the blood and do whatever is necessary with he bodies. Paul Birch plays the principle alien, hiding behind dark glasses so his lifeless eyes can't be seen. Beverly Garland is hired to look after him (he is actually dying and needs the blood to survive). He also hires Jonathan Haze (Little Shop of Horrors), an idiot ex-convict to be his driver and helper. Of course, clues start forming and our young woman, despite being warned, starts to do too much investigating. There is some really interesting 1957 dialogue, especially from Haze. There is also a great scene where an obnoxious vacuum cleaner salesman comes to the door and tries to sell the alien a vacuum cleaner. The only thing that gets vacuumed is his blood. This is just plain fun and has a bit of a kicker at the end. Roger Corman was responsible for many enjoyable evenings in my childhood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguably Corman's Best Sci-Fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A human-like alien leaves his dying planet to secure earthling blood that his planet needs.Too bad Corman didn't dump that flying lampshade that apparently sucks the doc's blood. Because that's really the only cheezy element of this otherwise effective monster flick. It's arguably Corman's best. Birch is pretty scary with his deadpan face and perfectly parsed diction. Just don't ask him to take off his glasses. Then too, I wonder what he puts down as eye color. Plus I would give dear Beverly Garland a drive-in Oscar for her sparkly portrayal of nurse Storey. It's a performance far and above the call of a paycheck.Yes indeed, what I remember from my first viewing decades ago is Dick Miller's vacuum salesman. He's so pesky and obnoxious, horns honked all over the drive-in when he got his. And what about the teen-age cutie who opens the film, even if she doesn't stick around. Too bad. Anyway, Corman sure knew his audience since we boys were hooked right then. Nonetheless, for the less hormonally minded, there's a message in the alien madness-- better watch out earthlings, nuclear war can cause a calamity that only a steady stream of blood can help. Okay, so the movie's not exactly Oscar bait. Nonetheless, it's got a better-than-usual Corman script, plus good location staging that keep the usual hokey sets to a minimum. Yes indeed, it's still fun to track the Darvana alien, and maybe honk your horn when Miller gets his.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sci-fi vampire tale is a nifty early Roger Corman picture.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, folks, it's a "vampire from outer space" story, nicely devised by Mark Hanna and frequent Corman collaborator Charles B. Griffith. It's snappy &amp; witty stuff, with particularly fun banter between co-stars Beverly Garland and Jonathan Haze. Despite being somewhat heavy on dialogue, it isn't boring (the very short running time does help), and producer / director Corman is clearly having a good time with this material. The actors are a treat to watch and there are effectively creepy moments along the way.The alien bloodsucker in question is blank eyed "Mr. Johnson" (Paul Birch), who needs the red stuff to replenish the dying population of his war-ravaged home planet, Davanna. After coming to Earth, he retains the services of amiable slimeball Jeremy (Haze, who would gain his greatest fame playing Seymour in Cormans' "The Little Shop of Horrors") as well as those of nurse Nadine Storey (the lovely Ms. Garland), whom he hires to live with him and provide regular blood transfusions. Those with the potential to thwart Johnsons' mission are Nadines' boyfriend Harry (Morgan Jones), a cop, and her understandably perplexed boss, Dr. Rochelle (William Roerick).Garland is certainly easy to watch, and rocks a one piece bathing suit in one sequence. Birch is amusing as the very cold and reserved villain. Haze is a real hoot in his role. Best of all is the cameo by longtime Corman regular Dick Miller, who's hysterical as a vacuum cleaner salesman. Filmed for the approximate sum of $100,000, this diverting little concoction has some fine moments where Johnson is communicating with associates back on Davanna, but the most freakish moment comes when a character is eliminated by a monster that resembles a lampshade; it's unnerving no matter how low tech the effects may be. And that ending is most enjoyable.Remade three times so far.Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roger Corman directed this surprisingly good science fiction/horror picture that stars Paul Birch as a cold-hearted alien from a dying planet decimated by nuclear war. As a consequence, he and his race need blood to survive, and find plenty of it here on Earth. He was brought here by a sophisticated matter transmission device hidden in his house, where he has hired a nurse(played by Beverly Garland) to see to his blood transfusion needs, though she becomes suspicious, involving her employer, a doctor who will have an unfortunate encounter with a bat-like creature brought by the alien... Though low budget, this doesn't hurt the film too much, since it keeps things simple but effective, with a creepy atmosphere and memorable end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Special Agent Johnson, intergalactic blood-collector!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now here's a fantastic hidden gem from the almighty B-movie emperor Roger Corman! Arguably even his finest directorial accomplishment of the 1950's, unless of course you fancy laughably inept monster movies like "Attack of the Crab Monsters" or "Creature from the Haunted Sea". "Not of this Earth" is an exceptionally atmospheric and solidly scripted Sci-Fi tale, with remarkably strong acting performances and even a handful of visuals and sequences that are genuinely shocking considering the time it was made. The eerily charismatic Paul Birch depicts an atypical alien ambassador from the planet Davana,on an attempted mission to rescue the population that is slowing dying following the results of a devastating nuclear war. He names himself Mr. Johnson and follows a 6-step program in order to fulfill his mission, which includes daily blood transfusions and selecting earthly specimens (like street bums and random Asian guys) to teleport across space through a closet door in his house. He hired the lovely Beverly Garland as a private nurse and also employs a lowlife thug as his servant/chauffeur. Johnson's deadliest weapons are hidden behind a thick pair of sunglasses and near the climax he suddenly also controls some kind of flying and bloodsucking jellyfish! Admittedly this all sounds like a bunch of campy nonsense, and it actually is, but it's the most entertaining type of campy nonsense imaginable! Traditionally these good old-fashioned fifties Sci-Fi flicks don't feature any redundant sequences or unnecessary sub plots, only straightforward action and relevant dialogs! Paul Birch and Beverly Garland are terrific in the lead roles, but also the supportive cast deserves some praise. Notably Corman's loyal buddy Dick Miller is memorable as a sly door-to-door salesman of vacuum cleaners. Roger Corman also produced a sleazy 80's update of his own gem in which contemporary porn star Traci Lords reprises the role of Beverly Garland. The plots are largely similar, but the 1988 version is more difficult to follow since the lead actress is parading around naked the entire time. Equally good fun, but go for the 50's original for sheer Sci-Fi nostalgia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moments of Genius!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Moments of Genius" may be an overly enthusiastic summary for this 1957 B flick. I admit to a love for and fascination with this movie that few other Corman movies have ever elicited. My early memories of seeing this as a kid on the Saturday horror showcase remain vivid to this day, 45 years later, and certain of it aspects have not worn out their welcome at all.Among its strengths are Paul Birch (playing "Paul Johnson") speaking with a carefully worked out accent, which uses a cadence and intonation that is quite unique and very effective. His dialog is written in an oddly stilted English that makes him sound highly educated but obviously foreign to the planet. (When his chauffeur honks the car horn, Johnson barks at him "Jeremy! I have ordered you not to sound the warning horn or make any high decibel noises while near me!") Birch matches this with a kind of physicality that is stiff but not at all ungainly. The bat/umbrella/cuttlefish thing is one of my favorite B movie props! The two final scenes are particularly effective as "Johnson" is fleeing the police, attempting to get them to look at his eyes. And the very last moment of the movie has stayed with me these many years as a singularly creepy conclusion.It is well known that Paul Birch and Corman had a sour relationship that devolved into fisticuffs and led to Birch leaving the movie before it was finished. Birch complained that the large contact lenses or scleral shells that created his white eyes were very painful and that he could only stand to have them in for a couple of minutes at a time. No wonder his fuse was a bit short!There are many ridiculous plot holes. Much of the acting is simply awful. But compared to its partner film "Attack of the Crab Monster" Not Of This Earth is relatively refined and watchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely a Bit Dated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An alien from another world, who goes by the name of "Paul Johnson" (Paul Birch) has come to Earth because his race needs blood. But prior to invading Earth and subjugating the human race, the aliens need more data from him on whether human blood can sustain them and for how long. His mission then is to stay alive long enough to collect this information and in order to do that he needs blood as well. After acquiring some from a nearby clinic, he hires a nurse named "Nadine Storey" (Beverly Garland) to administer blood to him on a daily basis and to keep him healthy for as much time as possible. In the meantime, he continues to kill people and send their blood through a portal to his home world of "Devana". At any rate, rather than divulging what happens next I will stop right here. However, I think it's only fair to say that this film is definitely a bit dated. Further, the film quality wasn't good and neither was the dialogue for the most part. Likewise, other than Beverly Garland, none of the actors really stood out in my opinion. Even so, I still enjoyed this movie and I think most people who are able to take films of this nature and from this time period into account will be able to do so as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** This review may contain spoilers ***This obscure Roger Corman film from 1957 is perhaps one of his best films despite that fact that many he has made are just terrible.The film is about an alien named Paul Johnson who comes for the planet Davanan. He is on Earth to drain blood from humans because radiation from a protracted nuclear war is causing his races blood to deteriorate. In some way he is a space vampire(not one that sparkles). Instead of using a flying saucer to come here, he comes using a matter transporter device, similar to the one used in Star Trek a couple years later. Another thing that interesting is that even though he comes from an advance alien race he is not very familiar to the way of Earth, like trying to drive for about Earth diseases. So I like this movie despite it being a Corman film. So I say give it a watch. But not the remakes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low budget Fifties sci fi flick is unnervingly funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had not seen this movie since I was a little kid, and it was on the Saturday afternoon Science Fiction Theatre, which specialized in Fifties movies. I remembered it as cheap and poorly done.I was astonished at viewing it recently for the first time in years, to discover it's a suspenseful, well acted thriller with a huge amount of black comedy throughout the macabre storyline. The script abounds in the sort of ambiguous dialogue that has been a feature of vampire films since the silent Nosferatu, with the mysterious Mr. Johnson barely attempting to conceal his true identity from his employees and victims. Paul Birch's deadpan line readings are so flat and humorless as to become utterly hilarious, but always with an ominous awareness of the terrible things he's capable of.I have seldom seen any movie that even comes close to the strange mingling of horror and comedy as this film achieves. Corman stated that he wanted to try something different, and that it was the first time he had attempted mixing horror and humor, but the result is a truly amazing picture, filled with unexpected developments. It is not a horror comedy like Corman's Little Shop of Horrors or Bucket of Blood, but the humor is unquestionably there.Performances are good throughout, especially Beverly Garland as the nurse and Jonathan Haze as the chauffeur. Dick Miller's brief scene is unforgettable, and clearly shows why he was a Corman favorite. Gail Ganley makes a very fetching young victim in one of the early scenes.In spite of the low budget, the atmosphere of otherworldliness is very effectively created. Scenes of Mr. Johnson communicating with his home planet by some sort of intergalactic television hidden in a living room closet are oddly believable. The humor is never campy. In fact, the sinisterly humorous undertones largely have disappeared by the end of the picture. When Mr. Johnson quietly comes onto the phone to let the nurse know he's been listening to her conversation and is now coming after her, it is a moment of genuine terror worthy of Alfred Hitchcock. Paul Birch's disquietingly polite Mr. Johnson never lets the viewer relax and dismiss him as an eccentric villain. There is a quiet edge of menace about him that becomes more apparent and quite frightening by the end of the film. His calm, implacable pursuit of the nurse is a real nail-biter.Roger Corman fans and Fifties science fiction buffs should see this odd, unsettling movie. It's not quite like anything else you've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why hasn't Roger Corman found a way to get this movie remastered. A watchable copy is available on DVD at scifistation.com. I think Paul Birch is probably the best person Roger could have chosen to play the part. The time mirror is excellent. It is great to watch the alien being able to walk up to a Chinese person and immediately start talking to him and taking possession of his mind. Beverly Garland is very good for her part as well. Johnathon Haze is fabulous as a chauffeur. The best parts are when the alien takes down his shades, and says "look into my eyes". Then he fries the peoples' brains who look at his eyes. I like the case he carries to take the blood from the people he kills. Then he keeps the jugs of blood in the refrigerator. He will then use it for his blood transfusions. Great fun watching him chase Beverly Garland at the end with his 56 or 57 Cadillac through the park saying "I am coming for you Nadine". "Look into my eyes". You almost pity the poor dying monster. Will he be able to get enough blood to send back to the dying planet through his time mirror? Will more come from the dying planet thirsting for blood? Herb Salisbury</fullReview>

The vampire hero strolling about with his briefcase full of medical equipment and his dark sunglasses make for a fascinating visual. Spooky concept, and very atmospheric for a low budget film.I remember seeing this film and many more fine Corman flicks on the Friday night horror movies (Shockwatch with your host, The Cool Ghoul) as a child, leading me to become a lifelong horror movie buff.

		<fullReview>In connection with research I am doing for a book I would like to ascertain if the original "Not of This Earth" (l957) directed by Roger Corman is available in DVD or, failing that, where one might obtain a good quality first generation VHS version. The film is classic Corman and neatly combines the "vampire" theme with the the l950s "paranoid sci-fi genre". It would also be interesting to hear if the subsequent re-makes (which I have not seen) are relatively faithful to the original or go in quite different directions. Information on the availability of these later remakes would also be helpful as would information on their availability in DVD or VHS format. Finally, in the opening scene to the film there are two young people sitting in an MG TD sports car. Their names do not appear in the credits and, to be sure, they were certainly playing "bit parts". Still, it would be interesting to know who they were if anyone has that information.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having only seen this film on TV and in bootleg videos with poor quality, it is great to know that Shout Factory will be releasing the original 1957 Not of This Earth on DVD in January 2011! Great campy fun with the scream queen Beverly Garland at her best. We recently lost Ms. Garland, but she will always be known as Roger Corman's favorite leading lady. Also in the cast as the alien is Paul Birch who also was in the campy Queen of Outer Space and Corman's earlier classic sci-fi film The Day the World Ended as the professor and dad to pretty Lori Nelson. Roger Corman as director really knew how to stretch a budget with Not of This Earth and the black and white photography and score serve to enhance the building suspense. This movie scared me when I was a little kid at the Union Theater in Union, NJ on a double bill with Attack of the Crab Monsters (also on this upcoming DVD). For those fans of Roger Corman's work, I recommend Not of This Earth and for those who wish to discover a little gem of a sci-fi classic, this is the one. Now if they could only get around to It Conquered the World (also with Garland) and a pristine print on DVD of The Wasp Woman that would be great. It's fun to view these 50s sci-fi films which were made on a shoestring but have becoming cult classics all these years later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cold War Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger Corman created a 1957 film that transcended its science-fiction genre and became instead a period-piece artifact of Middle American Cold War paranoia, McCarthyism and race tension.Those who are not of this earth are humanoid creatures who speak in suspiciously thick Eastern European accents, behave mysteriously, and dress in undertakers' suits, Ray Ban sunglasses and homburg hats (they MUST have inspired Belushi and Akroyd in creating the Blues Brothers).The aliens' mission is simple: to suck the blood of the human race, to short-circuit our brains with direct eye contact (sans shades), and to collect various specimens for study and experimentation back on their home planet.Corman makes a piercing social commentary when his Iron Curtain outworlders categorize our species either as "humans" (whites) or "subhumans" (people of color). Unfortunately for this film, most viewers over the years have seen this as an example of racism rather than an indictment of it. Such thinking is a disturbing example of identification with the enemy.As a result, the original NOT OF THIS EARTH is never broadcast and is only available through very limited outlets. There have been two remakes, in 1988 and 1995. The '88 remake stars former porn actress Tracy Lords in her first mainstream role as a nurse (in a skin-tight super short uniform), and is strictly camp. The 1995 remake with Michael York is absolutely forgettable. If you can find the original, give it a viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another classic Sci-fi /Horror genre from the Fabulous Fifties. Roger Corman does it again by drawing curiosity into his audiences imagination. Our story begins with a twisted tale of a Bespectacled rap-around sun glassed Paul Birch as the Alien Mr. Johnson. Johnson has a problem Iron poor blood. How poor? VERY POOR!! Your imagination runs wild as you see the pupil less eyed Mr. Johnson sitting in his easy chair telepathically communicating to his superior on the wall. So many questions hit your mind and the opening credits didn't even appear on the TV. Off to the Doctor's office for some blood and company. Enter the young blonde and vivacious Beverly Garland as Nadine the inquiring Nurse. Johnson is evasive in his explanation of hemoglobin issues. The Nurse passes the buck to her employer Dr. Rochelle played by William Roerick. Johnson uses mind control to have the Doctor fill his every need discreetly. Nurse Nadine has her trepidation about working exclusively for Mr. Johnson at any price. Johnson minus his pupils(EYES), takes it upon himself to drive around town disobeying traffic rules mainly parking Philadelphia style (any direction).Nurse Nadine's boyfriend Harry (Morgan Jones) who happens to be a cop was ready to write out a summons or two to the ailing Mr. Alien but Nurse Nadine comes to his rescue and tells him,"To put the book away, Mr. Johnson is an ailing man." Off to the mansion enter the chauffeur Jeremy (Jonathan Haze)who at first appears uncomfortable in his uniform but questions his bosses strange habits. Nurse Nadine gets comfortable in her new dwelling taking a dip in the pool but notices smoke coming from the house chimney on a 90 degree day. Her curiosity draws her to the basement furnace. Little does she know that Johnson just cremated a Vacuum salesman moments earlier. Speaking of vacuum salesmen, (Dick Miller) does a fine job of acting loses the sale and his life but Johnson keeps the vacuum.Throughout this movie Johnson kills his victims and takes their blood.One more tidbit is the umbrella monster that flies through the neighborhood and lands on the poor Doctor.The rest is up to you. In my estimation Paul Birch gave a strong performance in his only leading role. Beverly Garland shows how she landed parts in Hollywood by flaunting her looks. Just a classic from the vault of 50's Horror schlock films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a real pleasure to be able to access and see "Not of This Earth" in a great transfer DVD after being obscure for such a long time. Kudos to the folks at Shout Factory for bringing one of Roger Corman's best Allied Artists drive in flicks back to sci-fi fans after so long. NOTE has been a bit of a legend for a long time. Originally released on a drive-in double bill with the seafood classic "Attack of the Crab Monsters", NOTE disappeared from view sometime in the mid-60s after it popped up now and then on local "chiller/shock" late night TV with some local dressed up as Dracula doing the scary movie hosting.NOTE was a really remarkable effort, running a scant 60 minutes. The Corman regulars are here, hipster Dick Miller, stoic Paul Birch, the lovely scream queen Beverly Garland, a surprisingly hunky Jonathan Haze, and a briefly seen umbrella-creature designed by the legendary Paul Blaisdell. A terse story about an alien sent to Earth to seek out blood. Not a vampire, but close enough. Paul Birch's "Mr. Johnson" is a real piece of work: wooden, unemotional, thirsty, and evidently a ringer sent to Earth by his superiors on the planet Davanna to find subjects that will reinfuse the radioactive blood of the residents. The Davannites have been poisoned by atomic war and need fresh blood. Mr. Johnson sends victims back to his world by means of a teleportation machine he hides in the closet of his mansion. The scenes of interaction between Johnson and his superior are very unsettling. Understated, like everything else in this odd flick.Paul Birch, the white-eyed alien, is given great support by the other actors, including a brief but chilling appearance by a female alien played by Anne Carrol. The female Davannite falls victim to a transfusion of rabid dog blood. "There is activity inside me" she telepathically tells Johnson. Little time is wasted in this tale of interplanetary hunting, using a sharp script and tight direction by Roger Corman. The last shot in the movie is terrific.If you love the drive-in classics of the Fabulous Fifties, seek out NOTE and marvel at how well it's done. No cucumber Venusians conquering the world or 50 foot women, just a rarity from Corman: a superior scifi thriller that rose above it's humble origins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It manages to be both cool and cheesy at the same time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger Corman managed to produce and direct a ton of films that made the most of his very small budgets. Only one of his films failed to make money (and, oddly, it was one of his better films) and he managed to produce some very good films while making a picture in only one or two weeks in some cases! Now I am not saying they are all great art--some (like this film) had their cheesy moments. But they were very entertaining and fun."Not of This Earth" is a film about a bizarre alien who has come to this planet to try to cure his people from their blood disease caused by the 1950s horror, nuclear radiation. While his purpose for coming here is noble, the guy has no emotions and things nothing of experimenting on people or draining them of their blood to keep him alive. And, the way he does it with those cool eyes is something you'll need to see for yourself--as well as the ultra-cheesy creatures at the end of the film.The movie manages to elicit some good tension and chills and the leading man (Paul Birch) manages a weird other-worldly performance that worked very well. He was pretty darn scary. Plus, seeing him dispose of the bodies (such as perennial Corman actor Dick Miller) was pretty intense. Worth seeing--even if it might make you giggle from time to time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roger Corman's supremely cool nifty 50's low-budget alien invasion gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Burly, granite-faced tough guy character actor Paul Birch hits an all-time super evil zenith as Mr. Johnson, a strange, steely, secretive, stand-offish vampiric alien in deceptively mundane human guise who comes to Earth to nab hapless homo sapiens for his rapidly dwindling race back on his dying radiation-ravaged home world, which needs our precious healthy blood in order to survive. Hiding his glowing egg white hypnotic eyes behind a pair of snazzy black shades, speaking in a flat monotone, displaying an amazingly alert mind, but a crippling lack of social skills, and clad in a finely pressed business suit, Mr. Johnson, assisted by such unsuspecting earthlings as spunky nurse Nadine (a terrifically lively, personable portrayal by spirited, attractive blonde bombshell 50's B-movie queen Beverly Garland), sleazy chauffeur Jeremy (a deliciously smarmy Jonathan Haze), and decent dude physician Dr. Rochelle (an appropriately earnest William Roerick), has only five days to complete his desperate mission. It's up to Nadine's eager beaver motorcycle cop boyfriend Harry (stalwart Morgan Jones) to save the day.Directed in trim, straight-to-the-point efficient fashion by Roger Corman, ably adopting a smart, streamlined, wittily on-target script penned by frequent Corman picture scribe Charles Griffith and Mark Hanna, sharply photographed in cold, grayish film noir hues by John Messell, with all-around ace acting, a zippy pace, a superbly spooky, moody, skittishly blurting horn heavy score by great veteran exploitation feature composer Ronald Stein, hilariously dated hepcat lingo-laced dialogue ("Don't be a drag -- you know how much you flip me!"), a generally sober, grimly fatalistic tone, and sizable dollops of wryly amusing pitch-black humor (the ever-amazing Dick Miller has a wonderfully wise-a** comic cameo as a pushy, overly insistent hip-talking smoothie vacuum cleaner salesman and Mr. Johnson sends three drunken bums back to his home planet as typical Earthman specimens!), "Not of the Earth" rates highly as the authentic gnarly article and wholly deserves its killer cult reputation. Remade three times -- terminally useless Corman coattail rider Jim Wynorski puked forth an expectedly atrocious cheeseball campfest version in '88, in '96 there was a strictly passable made-for-cable redo, and most recently Corman produced the dreadfully chintzy distaff variant "Star Portal" -- the nifty 50's original remains the best and unquestionably one of Corman's finest, most dead-on enjoyable and effective forays into sci-fi/horror cinema to this very day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One look at this man could mean death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently picked up an imported copy of Not of This Earth from a market and was very pleased and surprised to as it is not available on video in the UK. I'd been after this for a while.A blank eyed alien vampire has to keep alive by getting the blood from other people. To do this, he has to kill and his victims include a young woman, a salesman, three dropouts, a Chinaman and a doctor. His assistant nurse also nearly gets transported to his home planet as a "specimen" but he is killed in a car crash at the end with the police after him and is rescued by her policeman lover. The alien wears sun glasses to keep his eyes covered and also can't stand loud noises. The last sequence is where the nurse and her lover are at the aliens's grave and after they leave a man in sun glasses arrives...Not of This Earth is one of Roger Corman's better efforts and is quite creepy throughout, helped by the music score.The cast includes 1950's sci-fi/horror and Corman regulars Paul Birch (The Day the World Ended), Beverley Garland (It Conquered the World, The Alligator People), Dick Miller (Little Shop Of Horrors) and Jonathon Haze (A Bucket of Blood).Not of This Earth is worth checking out. A nice little sci-fi movie.Rating: 3 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice 50s Sci-Fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not of This Earth (1957) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Decent sci-fi from AIP has an alien (Paul Birch) coming to Earth because his planets blood supply is low. He ends up with a stay-in nurse (Beverly Garland) and servant (Jonathan Haze) and it's not too long before they start to get curious about people who enter the house yet never leave. This is yet another low-budget Corman picture where the director is smart enough to know he's working with a low budget. Corman was always smart enough to work well within the budget and he does that once again here as we really don't get any fancy effects or mind blowing space ships or other items that we'd normally see in a picture like this. Instead he tries to build a story, characters and wrap them around one another and make for an interesting film, which, for the most part, is what he's done here. The idea of a planet dying and sending an alien to Earth isn't the most original idea but it makes for some mild entertainment here including some really good scenes involving Birch and his constant quest for blood. This quest for blood also leads to some very entertaining sequences including one where he invites some drunken bums over and the highlight of the movie when the one and only Dick Miller shows up as a vacuum salesman. Miller gets to play what I guess you'd call an Elvis-type with the slick outfit and "cool" dialogue but the actors is a real hoot. Birch is pretty good in the lead as it's easy to believe him as an alien and Morgan Jones also adds nice support as Garland's boyfriend. As for Garland, she's certainly gained a good reputation over the years and her performance here is decent, if nothing overly special. Haze also manages to be fun with his role. The low budget does lead to some silly stuff including the voice over work of the "other" alien. With that said, at just 71-minutes there's nothing ground breaking here but it is entertaining enough if you enjoy the genre and the type of films they were releasing around this time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roger Corman &amp; 50's Sci-Fi at it's best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie back in 2004 on DVD-R it was a poor washed up transfer of the film. I really enjoyed it. Roger Corman did a great job on this one. This is probably my favorite out of his 5 50's Sci-Fi Efforts. It is about an alien from another planet that is dying he comes to earth in search of blood. He goes to a Doctor's office asking for a blood transfusion. He ends up Mezmorizing the Doctor &amp; finally gets what he wants. He is hired a nurse greatly played by Beverly Garland an actress that is no stranger to 50's Sci-Fi. She was previously in Roger Corman's It Conquered The World from 1956 another 50's Sci-Fi Gem. Also one of my favorites. She was also in The Alligator People from 1959. Now Back to the film. Paul Birch plays the alien. He looks all but human. Until he takes off his sunglasses &amp; white eyes are revealed. He kills people with his death ray eyes. I don't wanna give away much more. It is a true Classic of the genre. Also I just found out this is to be released on DVD on July 20, 2010 by Shout Factory along with Attack Of The Crab Monsters from 1957. Great pairing as back in 1957 Allied Artists released both films in theaters on a Double Bill. Not sure if the DVD will have any extras maybe just the trailers. Audio Commentary by Roger Corman on both would be nice but seems I don't know none of his other 50's Sci-Fi Films released on DVD had bonus features. Day The World Ended from 1955 was released on a DVD Double Feature from Lion's Gate Home Entertainemnet with The She-Creature from 1956 &amp; neither had any bonus features not even the Trailers. I am sure since Shout! Factory is putting out this it will at least have The Trailer same with Crab Monsters. Anyway I give this film an 8!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen many Roger Corman movies i always wanted to see this one,i have seen the 2 remakes and i still think the 1988 one with Tracie Lords is the best.but this one is the original.with the beautiful Beverly Garland as nurse Nadine who has been hired to be nurse to an alien fiend played by Paul Birch,another Corman regular.and yes even the great Jonathan Haze as the ex con turned butler,cook,driver,and bottle washer.i watched this on veoh although there are annoying interruptions from the host the mortician(and loud cannibal corpse music playing in the background.the print i seen was not the best but it is watchable,and it is a very rare Roger Corman film that to my knowledge is not available on DVD just yet,at least in the u.s.but if you like Roger Corman films and the late beautiful Beverly Garland you will like not of this earth.8 out of 10,no I'm not crazy,its enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(There are Spoilers) Mimicking the creepy Men in Black-MIB-of UFO mythology Roger Corman's 1957 horror thriller "Not of This Earth" also adds into its storyline a vampire from outer space scenario. The film has to do with black clad, he even drives a black limousine, human looking alien from the planet Davanna Paul Johnson, Paul Birck, who's on earth looking for human blood in order for him to survive.Back in Johnson's home, on planet Davanna, after a number of atomic wars the inhabitant's blood had become almost totally void of life sustaining red blood corpuscles. This is causing the Davannien population to slowly die out as their planet becomes radioactive. Being sent to earth by his Davannien leader Johnson is trying to get all the information, with his super superior Davannien brain, about the complexities of the human blood supply system. Johnson is trying to find out if human blood can be used to sustain not only his life but the lives of his fellow Davannines as well.It doesn't take long for Johnson to establish himself in town by renting a mansion and hiring ex-con Jeremy Parrin, Jonathan Haze, as his butler driver and all around handyman. Needing human blood to survive Jonson gets Doctor Rochelle, Willam Roderick,to give him an immediate blood transfusion. This despite Dr. Rochelle not really knowing what blood type, Johnson tells him he's type O, he is by Johnson refusing to take a blood test! It's while Johnson is at Dr. Rochelle's clinic he takes a liking to his nurse Nadine Storey, Beverly Garland, whom he, with Dr. Rochelle's approval, hires for an astounding, in 1957 dollars, $200.00 a week salary.For a while things go as planned as Johnson gets his much needed and life saving blood supply by going out at night and offing a number of people. Johnson kills his victims with his deadly hard boiled egg looking eyeballs, that he keeps hidden by wearing dark sunglasses, that strikes them dead and then ends up draining them of their blood. Johnson does this with what looks like a portable blood transfusion machine that he carries around with him in a suitcase.Told by his leader to get him a specimen of a subhuman, which he calls earthlings, to transport back to Davanna for farther study Johnson, the obedient servant that he is, does as he's told. Getting hold of the local laundry deliveryman Harold Fung Johnson hypnotizes him and sends him back home, to Davanna, via his transport machine that he keeps hidden in his mansion. It turns out that Fung never quite makes it getting himself crushed to death before he ever reached Davanna.It doesn't take that long for both Nadine and Jeremy to start to realize that their boss is not just a bit peculiar but really nuts in his not only strange way of talking, like a telephone answering machine, but even weirder diet! Johnson is always seen gulping down drinks in a shot glass containing a smelly and gooey concoction of chemicals that he uses, besides human blood, to sustain himself.Things start really going bad for Johnson when he's contacted by a fellow Davannien-Anne Lee Carroll-who's been sent down to earth to tell him that their planet Darvanna is now totally kaput with everyone there just about dead and them being the planets only survivors! Trying to keep Carroll, who needs blood badly, alive Johnson uses rabid dog blood that he steals from Doctor Rochelle's office which causes her to go into convulsions and die. It's at the hospital that it becomes evident that Carroll isn't human and that her associate Paul Johnson, who's been seen together with her by both Nadine &amp; Jeremy, may not be human either! With his cover as a human being, or earthling, now blown Johnson is now determined to get blood at any cost and at the same time kill anyone who tries to stop him. This doesn't go too well with the local police who are out to get the blood thirsty lunatic and, not knowing it, also having the both ways and means to finally put an end to his reign of terror on earth for good.Far better then its 1988 remake "Not of This Earth" has despite its meager budget a first rate cast and thought provoking and interesting storyline coupled with the excellent direction of Roger Corman. That all more then makes up for the movies very cheap bargain basement special effects.</fullReview>
