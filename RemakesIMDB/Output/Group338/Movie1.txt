		<shortDescription>Going to hell in a handbasket</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a special name this genre--I call these "going to hell in a handbasket" (or just "hell handbasket") films. They are defined by taking "average Joes", often a bit timid at first, and setting them at odds against the world--initially through no, or at least relatively little, fault of their own--in an increasing spiral of dilemmas from which extrication seems impossible. The more they try to dig themselves out of a hole, the further they fall in. "Hell handbasket" films are often comedies, but need not be. Famous examples of the genre include After Hours (1985), Very Bad Things (1998), and My Boss' Daughter (2003). An even greater number of films have elements of the "hell handbasket" genre, combined with other genres, such as Suicide Kings (1997), Killing Zoe (1994) and Neighbors (1981). Because I really like what I consider nihilism in films, the "hell handbasket" genre is one of my favorites.I bring all of this up, of course, because The Out of Towners is one of the earliest examples, if not the first full fledged "hell handbasket" film. Even if not the first, it is certainly one of the most influential. It may not be one of the best films of the genre any longer, but only because its successors have taken its pioneering lead and upped the ante. Still, the final verdict for me at this point in time is a B, or an 8. That, plus its historical importance, makes it well worth watching.George (Jack Lemmon) and Gwen Kellerman (Sandy Dennis) are on their way from Twin Oaks, Ohio to New York City--George is up for a big job promotion. His company wants to make him Vice President of the head office in Manhattan. George is naturally a bit neurotic and obsessive/compulsive, and in order to make sure everything goes like clockwork, he has the trip planned out to the last minute.Of course, things start going wrong, beginning with the flight to New York, which is first put into a holding pattern because of excessive traffic, then later sent to Boston because of the weather. They arrive in Boston hours late, and there is little chance they can get to New York City on time. Despite his planning ahead, it looks unlikely that George will be at his interview with the company President at 9:00 a.m. sharp the next morning.If The Out of Towners has a flaw, it's that there are slight logical problems when it comes to the Kellermans getting into their increasingly difficult conundrums. A number of times viewers will find themselves asking questions like, "Wait, aren't their buses to New York City from Boston?" Or, "Why would they trust Murray (Graham Jarvis)?" Director Arthur Hiller, writer Neil Simon, and Lemmon and Dennis try to justify these decisions through characterization. George goes from neurotic and self-righteous to even more neurotic and self-righteous, which most of the time is sufficient support for him not always thinking rationally. Dennis goes from cool and collected (or at least she projects as much initially) to irritable, a bit panicky, and generally paranoid and put-off by the city. Still, there are times when the characterization isn't quite in tune with the characters' decisions. It doesn't happen too often, but often enough. Since this aspect is an extremely important element of "hell handbasket" films, it caused me to bring my rating down a point.On the other hand, it's clear that Hiller and Simon aren't always shooting for a straightforward, literal film. In many ways, The Out of Towners is something of a New York City parable. Most of the elements that make the city a challenge are present--including dilemmas of transportation, the high cost of living, the difficulty of finding readily available and amenable services, strikes, bureaucracy, crime, trusting fellow citizens, the mostly aloof treatment of crazies, protests, social and ethnic conflicts, and so on. By the end of the film, it's no longer just a race to get to a job interview on time; it's a "universal" conflict of man against New York City.George ends up yelling at the city in the middle of the street, "You won't beat me!"--even though he looks defeated. We could almost call it a love story for New York, although maybe only people who have lived in New York for an extended length of time would understand that. Since the Kellermans were out-of-towners, that might help justify the ending, which is otherwise inexplicable to New Yorkers. At any rate, if you're curious about what it's like to live in New York, watch The Out of Towners back-to-back with something like Woody Allen's Manhattan (1979). Even though both films are around 30 years old, the combination gives a good idea of the joys and joyous frustrations of living in the city.Like usual, maybe I'm being overly analytical or abstract for many folks. So back to the basics. More often than not, the Out of Towners is funny--maybe not always tears-rolling-down-your-cheek funny, but at least chuckle-funny. When it's not funny, it's usually a joy to watch Lemmon's performance. Dennis can be more challenging for many viewers (quite a few people, including my wife, found her more annoying during the later portion of the film), but for me, her character worked as a good combination of foil and catalyst for Lemmon, even if she was something like a slightly toned-down Fran Drescher in "The Nanny" (1993).Overall, the film works well enough to strongly recommend it, especially to Lemon fans, fans of comedies of this era, and fans of "hell handbasket" films, even if you didn't know you were one before you read this review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of Jack Lemmon. I loved him in the Apartment and the Odd Couple. Out-of-Towners is a timeless classic comedy in my opinion. I mean come on! Jack Lemmon in a Neil Simon story? How can you go wrong with that? There are alot of funny lines that Jack Lemmon uses that makes the movie what it is. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing the role of George Kellerman. This movie is a definte classic comedy that will never be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Repetition Can Be Hysterical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been reading some of the comments for this film, and I can't understand those who don't find it funny. Apparently they've never traveled or have never experienced a modicom of mess while traveling (and I LOVE to travel), or, have simply never had a really bad 48 hours, doing whatever! Lemmon's shear repetition of wanting to get everyone's phone number and address is hysterical, because through his fatigue in trying to cope with one problem after another in The Big Apple, he still finds the strength to take down everyone's name and number, and promises to retaliate at a later point in time. Sandy Dennis is a perfect, calm, albeit understandably very fatigued, foil for Lemmon's frustrated and hyper New Yorker-wannabe. For me, she's always a gem to watch.The scene in which Lemmon loses a tooth, followed by losing his hearing, followed by the ability to hear only every other word spoken, is quietly hysterical. Also very funny is his scene in the park "talking" to a little boy....that's all I'll say about that one. Overall, if you're in the mood for observing high-speed neurosis, played to comedic perfection by the inimitable Jack Lemmon, watch this film, and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the Remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't appreciate this film until I saw the updated version. This film starring Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis as Ohio visitors to New York City. The trip is nearly disastrous from the moment that they get off the airplane. Of course, this film is one of Neil Simon's better works. The couple lose their luggage, get robbed, and don't have a clue about the way that the city works. George is here for a job interview and has high hopes of moving to the city with his wife, kids, and dogs. He has a romanticized notion of New York City that he sees in the films and television shows. Being there is different from just the movies, I think the ending speaks for itself. New York City is not for everyone but it's how they came to the realization of how tough it is to be New Yorker and even the ending is something that could have generated a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guaranteed Hour of Laughter...!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My then 19 year old Son and I watched this movie on television about a year or so ago. I told him that he had to watch it because it was the funniest movie that I ever saw. He laughed so hard during the entire movie that I am and must find the DVD. This movie is a classic. It is a great movie to watch with one's family during the Holidays. A classic indeed. Another reason for me looking for this movie is that I have a girlfriend who at one point in her life was suing everyone that came across her path. That is what really got me on the search. Both Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis were a crack up. I loved her patience, while he was off on a rampage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis as a believable married couple who have a lot of chemistry together who travel to New York from Ohio and find themselves in hysterical situations. When Mr. and Mrs. Kellerman travel to New York for a job interview plus a romantic weekend the hilarity ensues. Two's company and New York is the crowd. If you want to laugh till it hurts this is the movie to see!!!!! Neil Simon has written a masterpiece. He is a genius when it comes to dialogue. Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis create synchronized lovable characters committed to each other through good times and bad.New York watch out here come the Kellermans!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unbelievable comedy,one of the best ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The real fascinating thing about cinema,is that no matter how many movies you might have seen,there are always going to be films that you have missed and are great ,to say the least.This is the case with the "Out of Towners". I saw a few years ago the remake with Steve Martin and as a big fan of Steve's i liked the film.Actually i didn't know back then ,that there was an original with Jack Lemmon.Anyway i have bought the DVD and just put it in a box to watch it sometime. I never thought, that this was an absolutely hilarious comedy ,with Jack Lemmon, for me ,being even better than "the odd couple". His character is similar to the one he played alongside Matthau ,but we are talking about an amazing performance here.I'm really surprised that he wasn't even nominated for an Oscar(he was nominated though for a Golden Globe). A couple (Sandy Dennis plays the wife)starts a journey to N.Y ,because Lemmon has planned an interview for his new job.He has a strict schedule that includes dinner at the "4 Seasons" restaurant and spending the night with his wife at his luxury hotel. I really can't describe what's happening after the boarding on the plane.EVERYTHING THAT COULD GO WRONG WENT WRONG. But the real magic of the film is that at no point in the film ,you can accuse the writers that they overdid it with the story.And Lemmon has a big part to do with that, because he plays amazingly. Sandy Dennis also plays her part extremely well and has a fine chemistry with Lemmon. A classic in my collection ,with out a doubt in the top-5 of all the comedies i have ever watched. Watch it and enjoy yourselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A classic and one of the funniest films ever made. Directed by Arthur Hiller in that dead-end style of his, (the best that could be said for him was that he knew how to point a camera and keep his actors in front of it), but it's got a cracker of a script by Neil Simon and two of the greatest comic performances ever put on film by Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis.They play two small-town Americans who think promotion and a life in New York is Nirvana itself when in fact it is a hell that even Dante could not envisage and no-one can capture the comedy of escalating awfulness better than Simon, at least in America. In Britain, this is the terrain of Alan Ayckbourne. It's really nothing more than a series of strung together gags but Lemmon and Dennis are great farceurs and Simon knows how to build the jokes one on top of the other. There is nothing original about the film but then who needs originality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1970 version of The Out of Towners was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I first saw it when I was a teenager back in the 1980's, but I rented it just last week because I needed to be cheered up.This is the type of movie that when you watch it it will make your day. You cannot think about anything else but the craziest that is happening on screen.Jack Lemmon was fantastic as George Kellerman. He is truly insane and the movie would have been dull without him. Sandy Dennis was perfectly cast as his wife and was a perfect compliment to Jack Lemmon's confrontational and neurotic character. I see that the director was careful to not put any distractions that would have taken anything away from the film such as making sure that Gwen Kellerman was an average looking (and acting) wife.The whole movie was hilarious, but I thought the funniest parts of the movie for me were 'The Car Chase' when George and Gwen went along on a high speed chase in the police car that was supposed to take them to the armory. Then, if things couldn't get worse, the crooks take over the cop car with George and Gwen still inside and then decide to dump them in the middle of Central Park. The second hilarious scene was scene with the lost little boy and the chase by the policeman on horseback in Central Park. Later that morning, after being kicked out of the church where they were praying, George Kellerman goes on a tirade in the middle of the street "YOU HEAR THAT NEW YORK, WE DON'T QUIT! NOW HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT!!..." This is the perfect movie to watch on a rainy Sunday morning or if you're feeling down and that the whole world is against you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is incomprehensible how Leonard Maltin can badmouth this riotously funny movie. Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis play off beautifully against each other in this tale of two misbegotten and forlorn visitors to the Big Apple who suffer every indignity that can befall two out-of-towners, and then some. It's a comedy classic in my book. The 1999 Martin/Hawn remake pales by comparison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exponential Murphy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now that I'm retired I do a bit of traveling now and I make itineraries that I like to stick to. What happens to Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis is every traveler's nightmare in between all the laughs.Starting with the circling around the airport, I remember once circling an hour and a half at Newark Airport because flights were backed up and that's after an hour delay from Rochester. That was 20 years ago and I haven't had anything like that happen to me recently. It can be incredibly nerve wracking and I well sympathize with what was happening.That would normally be enough. But Mr.&amp;Mrs. Kellerman go exponential Murphy on this trip. Everything that can go wrong does, every single solitary thing from lost luggage to canceled hotel reservations to spending a night on the ground at Central Park and plenty more besides. All this on a nice dreamed of vacation in New York for this middle America Ohio couple who are combining business and pleasure as Lemmon is also in town for a job interview.Jack Lemmon is a perfect fit for his American everyman character and Sandy Dennis provides an interesting brand of quirkiness as the wife. Although there are some talented players in the cast including a rising Billy Dee Williams in the role of a ticket agent, they're fairly one dimensional as the film for about 90% of the time focuses on Lemmon and Dennis and their travails in the Big Apple.Do they get out of all their woes. Well I can say is, think about that musical number that Bing Crosby and Olga San Juan did in Blue Skies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the funniest films I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite simply, there are few other films with as many spots to laugh at as "The Out-of-Towners." It's really a straightforward plot, with a man (Jack Lemmon) and his wife (Sandy Dennis) going on a business trip to New York and running into one problem after another, leading them from their plane to a train to the city streets. Ordinarily, a film with this plot would consist of nothing special. However, it is Jack Lemmon's superb comic delivery and mastery of coming up with funny things to say that make this a very special film. Line after line, he delivers, and the jokes get funnier as the movie goes on. It's his dialogue that makes the film what it is. Usually I dislike films with plots like this, but this one manages to stay funny without stressing its audience out. Some may prefer Jack Lemmon in films like "Some Like it Hot" and "Mister Roberts," but in my opinion, this is his best role. Never before has he accomplished comedy as great as this. A truly perfect film, from beginning to end. I have not tired of it after seeing it many times.***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sat down at my computer, intent on writing a brief review of 'The Out of Towners (1970).' I figured it would take about thirty minutes to complete the review, and so planned my night accordingly. At first everything went to plan, and I remained on schedule; then ? with a dull droning sound, like that of a whimpering animal ? my computer suddenly took it upon itself to shut down for no apparent reason. With a light curse, I leaned across and rebooted it, and this time we got as far as the Windows welcome screen. Then the lights flickered brightly, and I was suddenly plunged into darkness; the power was out. Reflecting that perhaps it was only a problem with my own fusebox, I stepped out and circled around to the back of the house, where I fumbled somewhat pathetically with a few of the electrical dials. Just as I was heading inside, the power clicked back on, something in the fusebox sparked, and, before long, my entire home was ablaze? and nary a firetruck in sight.'The Out of Towners (1970)' might just be the most frustrating film I've ever seen. Whatever can go wrong will go wrong, and at the worst possible time, in the worst possible way. For a cocky businessman (Jack Lemmon) and his neglected wife (Sandy Dennis), a meticulously-planned trip to New York City is first disrupted by a seemingly-minor delay, which gradually blossoms into a fully-fledged urban disaster. With an important business interview scheduled for 9:00AM the following morning, George Kellerman must endure every difficulty known to Mankind, including the input of mousy wife, Gwen, with whom he is forced to form a shaky alliance. Flight delays, lost baggage, monsoon weather, muggings, kidnappings, city-wide transit strikes, vicious dogs, gas explosions ? nothing is neglected, and George shouts himself hoarse throughout the proceedings, declaring his intentions to sue everybody whom he perceives as having contributed to his awful string of bad luck. Even God has seemingly neglected the pair, who are unceremoniously dismissed from a church by an unapologetic news camera crew.Lemmon and Dennis are very entertaining in the main roles, and the various supporting performances complement the story perfectly. It's interesting to note how the husband-and-wife relationship shifts constantly as they are confronted by each new setback: at first, George is rather dismissive of his wife, using her primarily to "verify" facts to be later used in the courtroom. Though she subsequently commits some rather foolish acts, such as handing over George's $200 watch to a strange caped man, the couple do eventually acquire a mutual respect towards each other. Neil Simon's story might also be interpreted as a critique of modern society, in which citizens in the bustling metropolises are unwilling to offer help to those in need of their assistance. Burdened by his own hefty share of difficulties, George is quickly consumed by the selfishness of the city and comes to care only for his own wellbeing. Gwen, however, retains her sense of moral rectitude and pauses to care for a lost boy in Central Park. Remind me never to go to New York.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seen This Film Over &amp; Over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many times I have viewed this film over the years mainly because I am a big fan of Sandy Dennis, (Gwen Kelleman) who plays the role of a wife from Ohio and her husband, George Kelleman, (Jack Lemmon) who wants to go to New York City for a job position that George would like to have and they encounter many problems that they never expected. This couple find themselves having to sleep in Central Park and are robbed of everything they have and there is plenty more situations that they are faced with. In the beginning of this film Sandy Dennis and Jack Lemmon were flying in from Ohio and landing in a real airport on Long Island MacArthur Airport in Ronkonkoma, New York where I actually worked at the Army Aviation Support Facility #1. It was great seeing this entire scene of great movie stars being filmed at this New York Airport. It is a great shame that Sandy Dennis had a very short life which cancer overpowered her, she gave a great performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. Jack Lemmon...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Getting ahead in your career or moving on with your life doesn't necessarily mean moving `up.' That promotion or `golden opportunity' that comes along may not in reality turn out to be all that it would seem, initially, especially if it involves an unprecedented upheaval in your life, like a transfer to another city. It's a situation that becomes grist for Neil Simon's humor mill in the comedy-of-errors `The Out-of-Towners,' directed by Arthur Hiller. Jack Lemmon stars as George Kellerman, a Midwesterner who finally gets that `big chance' when his company offers him a job in New York City. It sounds good, and just like that, George and his wife, Gwen (Sandy Dennis), are on a plane headed for the Big Apple to look into this opportunity of a lifetime. When their plane lands in New York, however, it's as if the wheels touching the runway triggers something in the cosmos alerting Murphy (whoever he is), who instantly puts his `Law' into effect. And, as Dinah Washington once said in a song, `Now it begins--' In this case, one cliche after another, all falling into place like dominoes during a tournament in the park. Missing luggage; a problem with their hotel accommodations-- as in, they have no reservation; being taken advantage of by a stranger, a native New Yorker looking for an easy mark; getting mugged; a broken tooth. Think of anything that could possibly go wrong, and it's in here. And you know what? it's funny stuff. Under Hiller's steady, if not too imaginative direction, cliche-ridden as it may be, this comedy works, and the reason can be summed up in two words: Jack Lemmon. The whole concept of the story is tried and true, but tired; and this is definitely not one of Simon's best efforts (good as it is). But Lemmon immerses himself in his character, takes the laughing ball and runs with it, and makes even the most weathered and worn situations seem fresh and new. And, most importantly, he's going to make you laugh, which in the end is what this movie is all about in the first place. What makes Lemmon so successful is that chameleon-like quality of his that enables him to become whatever character it is that he's creating. His creations may share that frustrated stammer and that tendency toward animated behavior that is so `Lemmon,' but beyond and beneath that, he has the ability to bring a definite sensibility to his characters that makes each of them unique. Here, you believe that George is a lifelong Midwesterner, and it shows in his entire countenance: His manner, attitude, body language and approach to everything he encounters in the Big City. George, however, is not your typical wide-eyed, naive and overwhelmed country-bumpkin-come-to-the-city. Instead, Lemmon creates a very real sense of an average guy facing a new experience in his life-- one that just happens to go completely awry. And by developing a character grounded in reality, he makes the humor work; it gives the audience someone to whom they can relate. It's something that Lemmon does so well, and he makes it look so easy while he's doing it. As Gwen, Sandy Dennis is pointedly droll, so low-keyed in the face of their predicaments, in fact, that it would not have been out of character had George checked for her pulse occasionally. Her performance is fairly `theatrical,' more conducive to the stage than film, but in contrast to Lemmon's antics, it somehow becomes quite viable, and actually turns out to be one of the memorable aspects of the film. When you think about George later, you're going to have to think about Gwen, too. Gwen serves as something of a sounding board for George, a mirror in which his frustrations are reflected and enhanced. Ultimately, her non-expressiveness itself becomes an expression of her character, and though Gwen comes across as more caricature than character, within the context of the material, it works. And, as Lemmon's counterpoint, she plays it very well, and pulls it off without a hitch. In addition to Lemmon's presence, one of the things that makes this film so funny is the accessibility of the characters; it is so easy to project yourself into their situation, and sharing their misadventures through the magic of film makes it hilarious. And you can empathize with George and Gwen, because down deep you realize that actually having to live through such an ordeal would be anything BUT funny. It IS fun, however, to experience it from the comfort of your own living room. The supporting cast includes Sandy Baron (Lenny Moyers), Anne Meara (Woman In Police Station), Robert Nichols (Passenger), Ann Prentiss (Stewardess), Ron Carey (Cab Driver), Philip Bruns (Officer Meyers), Graham Jarvis (Murray), Carlos Montalban (Manuel), Billy Dee Williams (Clifford), Richard Libertini (Railway Porter) and Paul Dooley (Day Porter). After seeing this movie, who would ever be able to forget George, finally at the end of his rope, standing in the middle of the street, refusing to give up and railing at the city itself, challenging it to take it's best shot at him. And that's just one of the many moments that makes `The Out-of-Towners' such a delight, no matter how many times you watch it. At times, the humor is a bit acerbic; but in the final analysis, this is a film that's going to connect with just about any audience. It's the magic of the movies; but more than that, it's the magic of a terrific actor named Jack Lemmon. I rate this one 8/10. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny movie, funny Jack Lemmon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw it a couple of days ago following "The Odd Couple" at TCM, and contrary to the opinion of a fellow commentator who also saw them that day, enjoyed both films similarly. These have always been some of my favorite film comedies (I can't help though watching "The Odd Couple" and thinking what Billy Wilder would have made of that film). These are the Neil Simon films I enjoy most (I may add Seems Like Old Times), and I simply have to watch "The Out of Towners" every time they show it on TV. I lived in NYC so it is always a treat to revisit the city. Watch this film to see what real cinema was in the 70's, with real people, real crowds, on location filming and no special effects ? except the amazing scene with the manhole cover, which I can't believe was the real deal even though it looked that way. I was also impressed with how much running Lemmon and Dennis do. Lemmon even carries Dennis in his arms up a small hill in Central Park. Like I said, the real deal. Lemmon of course is a physical comedy genius, and I also find Dennis very funny. After repeated watching some scenes ? the kid in the park, e.g. ? seem now forced and unfunny. I'd also have to agree about Lemmon's poor decision-making, but this is a comedy so that doesn't bother me too much. The Martin-Hawn remake, on the other hand, was simply horrendous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this film. Jack Lemmon is outstanding and Sandy Dennis is great as the supporting wife (she's very sweet and I love the way she says "I'm getting a bit irritable" about half way into the chaos). The script is superb with funny, witty dialog. The direction and camera-work is great - sometimes almost documentary in style, sometimes very original and groundbreaking. I also love the 70s style with the cars, signs, colors, interiors and clothes. And the music! See it, buy it (if you can get hold of it). It's a film worth seeing many times. I've already said my piece, but, you know, there's this 10 line requirement, so I do a bit of rambling here. There, now it's gotten through....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ending Trivia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Something many people don't know is that the theatrical version of the film ended differently than the current prints. WARNING SPOILERS:When they say "This plane is going to Havana" at the end, all current prints end with Sandy Dennis saying "Oh my God!". But in the real version of the film at the theaters, she said "Oh my God...we're being hijacked (or "skyjacked"). Hijacking planes (or "skyjacking" as it was called) was in the news a lot at the time as there seemed to be a rash of them going on. When some people complained that this film "glorified" or "made light" of this serious issue, this final line of the film was cut when the film first was shown on television. So now she just says "oh my God...." Unfortunately, it seems like all prints of the film which remain are now altered like this. Would love to know if the original theatrical version still exists somewhere.Things were much more uptight in 1970 I suppose....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this for the first time as a kid in the 70s. It has always been one of my favorite movies in this genre. In re-watching it again last night, I once again marvel at the genius that was Jack Lemmon. Other recaps about the story's premise have already been given here, so I'll forgo that. This movie is hysterical...all the way down to the score. Jack Lemmon's tension and neurotic persona are brilliantly played out. Sandy Dennis was the perfect compliment to his "fast-paced" character. Her ability to stand by her man and be the obliging wife echoes both the time period of this movie, as well as her direct dichotomy to her husband's personality. They are simply perfect together. I know others have commented on her annoying voice, but to me, that made her part hilarious. There are so many funny scenes, and I find myself smiling throughout the entire movie. From the "circling and stacking", the buckling ankles, the Cuban ambassador fiasco, all the way to the end of the movie hijackers, this film is a true gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FLYING TO NEW YORK WAS THE 1ST MISTAKE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "Out Of Towners" (not the silly remake with Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin) is a underated comedy. Jack Lemmon is brilliant as the stressed Ohio businessman. I don't think any other actor could have reacted or acted as well as Lemmon does. He complains and gripes through the entire movie, yes, but he does it with intensity and not "over the top" histrionics. His complaining and reacting to misfortune is what carries the movie. The alternative would have been not reacting to the changes in plan and just giving up. This couple from Ohio keep trudging along. Most actors would have tried too hard to show the audience how "angry" they were. Lemmon's character takes down names, mutters to himself, and alternates between exasperated expressions and resignation that I found very amusing. I thought they could have found a more attractive actress to play his wife, than Sandy Dennis, but she does play the role well. She does not over react to Lemmon's verbal barrages. They become a likeable pair, and you root for them. Had they become overly aggressive or nasty, they would have lost the comedic touch they maintained. They remained charming with a comedic flair as they traipsed through the streets and subways of New York. It was a great performance by a great actor, Jack Lemmon.</fullReview>

Of course you wanna strangle Jack Lemmon by the end of the movie, but that's why he is so great in it. I can't imagine any two people who could have better or more hilariously portrayed George and Gwendolyn Kellerman, the naive Ohio couple on their visit to hell...er... New York City.

		<shortDescription>A hilariously funny out-of-town comedy experience!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very funny movie; one of the funniest movies that Jack Lemmon made during his career (his role in this one was hilarious). Sandy Dennis was great as well, playing the wife of Lemmon's character. When it comes to a comedy, Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis know how to be funny. This film is about a young Ohio couple, George and Gwen Kellerman (played by Lemmon and Dennis) who are on the way to New York City for a business trip that George has the next morning. They expect to have a nice time, but as soon as they leave home, things start to get very hectic and go wrong, basically one thing after another. First, when they are on their flight to New York, the pilot says that everyone on board will have to go to Boston (after much time consumed circling over the big city, due to weather conditions), they lose their luggage when they arrive at the Boston airport (and try to find it in a panic, while hurrying to catch a train), they hustle by cab over to one station to board a train, but Gwen has to go to the women's room, but can't find it due to hurrying to make the train (the one they board has no one on but a cleaning lady, and they miss the one they were looking for, which was next to the empty one), then they hustle to another station to get on board one and try to get something to eat on a car with almost no food, they arrive later on at a transit station in New York and discover that all of the transportation services are on strike, so they walk in the rain to their hotel, and Gwen breaks the heel on her shoe while walking before they arrive, only to discover that their room was given away to someone else after the 10 pm deadline, then they walk with a man who helps them find another room (only to rip them off by robbing them at gunpoint, taking George's wallet), then they try to go to the police station to report the guy who scammed them, then go the armory by the police, only to get their route foiled by some liquor store robbers, they get dumped in the park and mugged by a stranger at 4 am while sleeping under a tree (George's watch was taken while he was sleeping), then they find Cracker Jack on a bench for breakfast (that a dog steals almost immediately, which George breaks a tooth on, causing him to whistle on his spoken S's), they get chased by a cop on horseback for an assumed problem with a child in the park, and more funny situations to come. After a few more mishaps, they finally make it to their same hotel destination with their luggage brought back earlier, thanks to the airport in Boston, but George can't get his suitcase unlocked due to the fact that the scam guy from the night before has his key in his wallet, then George goes to his interview, making it on time, in spite of his disheveled appearance (and he thought he wasn't going to make it due to the strike). But, then they realize that New York is not the place for them to live, so they go on back home. But, while they are on the plane, they find out that the flight that they boarded to go back home is hijacked en route to....Havana, Cuba!!! Uh, oh! See this movie and you will see for yourself just how funny an out-of-town trip can be!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How NOT to act in New York (or any other city)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No offense to Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn, but this movie should not have been remade. It's not fair to Martin-Hawn that Lemmon-Dennis hit their version out of the park. Any remake would suffer.Jack Lemmon as George Kellerman is a lesson to us on how not to act in any place out of your natural environment.He is fantastic with his taking down names, numbers, badges, offices, titles, and whatever else he can remember (expecting a cabdriver to mail you change?). And in typical New York fashion, everybody reacts with a "Yeah? So what?" attitude.Rule #1 when you're an out-of-towner visiting a "big" city: Don't draw any more attention to yourself than you already have. This goes double if you're not in your own country.You just want to go up to him and say "forget a life in this city, you can't even handle a night in this city!" Rule #2 is more basic than Rule #1 (this goes even for when you're at home). Just behave yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sandy Dennis and Jack Lemmon play two mid-western Americans who come to the Big Apple when Lemmon has a job interview with a prestigious agency. It's not enough that their plane is re-routed to Boston because of a fog-in, but the train they're on has no food to sell them and once they do arrive in New York, their reservation at the Waldorf has been canceled. Con-artists rob them; A man in a cloak takes Lemmon's watch willingly without even demanding it; Spanish-speaking visitors to Central Park accuse Lemmon of being a child molester; They end up in the limousine of a foreign ambassador who is the victim of a protest; Lemmon chips his tooth on the prize in cracker jacks and just about goes deaf when an exploding man hole misses his head by an inch. So don't think you'll hear Dennis or Lemmon humming the wispy tune that plays over the opening credits. All they want to do is get out of Manhattan as fast as possible, and I don't mean to the Bronx or Staten Island too.This hysteria comes from the delightfully demented mind of the usual New York cheerleader Neil Simon who wrote about "Sweet Charity", gave us newlyweds prancing around "Barefoot in the Park", and lamented the life of a "Prisoner on 5th Avenue". Those were all Broadway shows that eventually ended up as films, and this film went straight to the screen without a stop where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway. This means you get a lot of great location footage of New York during the age of Aquarius and get to see visitors to one of the world's greatest tourist attractions being taken advantage of for being, as Roz Russell sang in "Wonderful Town" about her own people far from New York, "Babbity, Provincial!".Unlike the later Steve Martin remake (and his similar comedy "Planes, Trains and Automobiles"), Lemmon and Dennis simply accept things as they happen, her occasional "Oh my God!" being more like "Here we go again!" rather than "Can you believe this crap?" Yes, Lemmon may threaten to sue every cop, hotel manager or bus driver who gives him a hard time, but its out of sudden frustration, and it is identifiable for any naive tourist or business visitor who had to get a bit tough when the city around them started moving faster than they could keep up with. New Yorkers, as kind as they can be to tourists and business visitors, on occasion like to see the darker side of what its like for outsiders to come to the city, and the results are hysterically funny. It may not be funny as you go through the situations that Dennis and Lemmon go through, but you can tell that in 30 years, their characters would go down memory lane and laugh when the other one said to them, "Remember when..."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Criticized by some for being too critical of 1969 NYC, THE OUT-OF-TOWNERS is so flat out hilarious, it's impossible to not recommend it. One cringes with fright just thinking of what predicament visiting business exec Jack Lemmon will get himself and wife Sandy Dennis into. Re-routed by air to Boston, Lemmon &amp; Dennis arrive via an abominably crowded train to a dismal NYC after midnight. Unable to find lodging (Lemmon didn't call ahead to inform the hotel he'd be arriving late...he was too busy "circling" New York before heading to Boston), the couple hit the streets --- hard. Ripped off by con man Graham Jarvis, caught up in a protest alongside Cuban consul Carlos Montalbán and deafened by an exploding manhole cover are just a few of the calamities these two endure. Lemmon is hysterical being hysterical, though claiming to be calm at all times. Dennis is infinitely patient, well matched with Lemmon as they try desperately to make it through a single night. Neil Simon's acidic script foreshadows his later PRISONER OF SECOND AVENUE. Arthur Hiller adds another comedy classic to his resume and the supporting cast is littered by a bunch of great New York character actors: Anne Meara; Ron Carey; Dolph Sweet; Richard Libertini. Anthony Holland is perfect as a hotel desk who, though appearing sympathetic, makes it clear that he could care less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was only a 12 year old kid when I initially saw this movie on the first day of my summer vacation from school back in 1970. We laughed so hard throughout that I missed many funny lines. Since then I have seen this movie several times, and still find it uproariously funny. I am a Midwesterner who loves visiting New York City, so I do not believe it is a put down of the big apple, but simply a comic study of a trip where everything goes wrong for a very high-strung person and his comparatively passive wife. Lemmon plays this frustration beautifully, and the angry humor is as much cathartic as it is hilarious. While no cinema classic, it remains one of the funniest movies of its time, and one I enjoy upon repeated viewings.</fullReview>

Almost immediately everything that can go wrong, does go wrong. Just when you think it can't get worse, it gets much worse. After a few negative incidents you become convinced that nothing worse could possibly happen . . .This movie will shock you more than once before it's over, and you'll still get a twist at the end.

		<fullReview>Leonard Maltin must have been having a very bad day when he panned this wonderful film. How could you not like it? It's an absolutey charming movie, and one of Neil Simon's best stories. The story concerns a middle-aged Ohio couple who travel to New York for the husband's job interview. The rest of the film details the problems the duo encounter while visiting The Big Apple, though their troubles actually start before they get off of the plane. As the bewildered, but determined couple, Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis make a magnificent comedy team, and there's never a dull moment when this dynamic duo are on screen. Granted, it is quite clear that the characters played by Mr. Lemmon and Miss Dennis weren't meant to be entirely sympathetic, but it's hard not to like these two equally gifted performers, whatever the circumstances. They're truly a perfect match. Many have said that Mr. Simon's script is his hate letter to The Big Apple, but considering the more than slightly pig-headed central characters, this could also have been his way of rebuking us Ohioans. Whatever the case, this is a thoroughly enjoyable movie, and one the whole family can enjoy. Skip the Steve Martin/Goldie Hawn remake and settle only for the untoppable original. **** all the way!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this excellent Neil Simon comedy, Jack Lemmon is up for a promotion at his company's (he specializes in plastic precision instruments) corporate office in New York City and he takes his wife Sandy Dennis along for a tour of the city. Right from the get-go, it becomes a living hell for the two. It all starts when NYC is fogged in and they have to fly to Boston. Second, they can't find their luggage. Then, they miss their train to New York. It only gets worse. They lose their hotel room, get mugged by a mysterious Graham Jarvis (as Murray), become captive of liquor store looters, get mugged yet again, Jack breaks his tooth on a Cracker Jack, he is accused of molesting a child, Sandy loses her wedding ring briefly, Lemmon has temporary hearing loss from an exploding gas main, and get caught in a anti-Communist riot. When it's all over, Jack gets the promotion but has to turn it down because he feels that the city life is too much for him and his wife. But one last disaster befalls the two one their flight home; their plane is hijacked.In my opinion, this is Neil Simon's best after The Odd Couple. Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis are perfect as the hapless couple who experience nothing but trouble in their 24 hours in New York. there are some brilliant and funny line that have somewhat become part of us ("I'm suing all of them, I don't care if I'm in court all year."). Overall, it blends into a very funny movie. Also, keep an eye out of Anne Meara (Ben Stiller's mom) in a cameo role as a purse snatching victim.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No alien abduction as well? Weird.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not exactly one of Neil Simon's better scripts. The essential problem with TOOT is that the bad karma that follows Lemmon and Dennis is far too exaggerated, over-the-top, to the point where it can't be funny. If you want gags to work, in this kind of "reality-based" comedy at least, you need to make the characters and events seem real. That's not the case here.Dennis and Lemmon enter the police station exhausted, penniless, recently mugged, and wet ? and yet she shows genuine concern for the milk strike in NY. "You mean to say that the children will be without their milk?" Not funny, merely stupid. If Simon wanted his female character to be retarded, then he should have made her properly retarded, in which case this kind of behaviour would be logical ? hence perhaps funny. As it is, she behaves in a clear-cut retarded manner on several occasions, which doesn't add to the comedy level but drowns it out.What kind of woman would lose one eye-lash and then plow on with the one that's left? I have never met such a woman. Every woman would remove that other eye-lash straight away. And that's why that whole eye-lash business isn't funny at all. Perhaps a bag-lady or a loony woman might behave that way but not your normal, average 70s housewife, mother of two. Simon wants to have his cake and eat it too: have Dennis represent an average middle-aged woman, but also have her behave as if she's totally unbalanced and half-insane in order to get a few cheap laughs.The scene where Lemmon tries to find money in the kid's pockets? Unfunny. Total nonsense. It's stuff like that which makes this comedy rather forgettable, worthy of a few chuckles here and there, but that's about it. The pair getting filmed by reporters in front of the Cuban embassy was one of the few funny moments, especially in the overly silly second half."Plains, Trains &amp; Automobiles", an 80s comedy with an almost identical premise, was hilarious, i.e. it worked far better, for the simple reason that the bad luck is mostly plausible, relatively realistic so that the viewer can identify with the situations and find the events funny as a result. Simon quite mistakenly thought that by making the bad luck increasingly absurd, this would somehow make TOOT funnier and funnier. The opposite happens; the increasing stupidity of what's happening to the couple just serves to bore and annoy until you just stop caring too much what happens next."After Hours", a superb comedy in which the main character also survives an abysmally unlucky night in New York, worked because it was clearly intended to have a slight fantasy slant, not to mention that the bad things that happen to its main character were mostly quite unpredictable, totally unique. In TOOT, there is no element of fantasy and most situations can be anticipated, some even minutes in advance. The element of predictability in TOOT is its second-biggest problem.For a proper Neil Simon comedy, check out "The Sunshine Boys", "Murder By Death", "Plaza Suite", or "The Odd Couple". Watch this only if you have very strong reasons to, such as Lemmon being your distant cousin or because it is the only movie being shown at the same time on 57 channels. Now, THAT would be bad karma for sure.</fullReview>

In the scene with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis arguing in the New York street, Jack hears a hissing sound near by. Moments later, the manhole cover blasts into the air and then lands just inches from Jack Lemmon. According to TV Guide, this was not a special effect, but a real incident. The director decided to keep the surreal footage, shot a few scenes to blend it into the story, and added it to the long list of mishaps the characters encountered in the movie. It's a miracle no one was hurt in that take. I'm sure the involved insurance companies breathed easier too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Lemmon vs. The City of New York ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will it matter to know that the director of ''The Out-of-Towners'' is Arthur Hiller, the same who made the highest-grossing movie of the same year ''Love Story'' ? Probably not. Or maybe a little, as there are some touching expressions marital love and understanding (or at least pretensions) between the husband George, played by Jack Lemmon and his wife Glen Kellerman, played by Sandy Dennis. There is also a sort of hidden message lying underneath this series of incredible misadventures that directly puts in equation the kind of life suburbans like George and Gwen wish to commit themselves to, even if it costs George a position as Vice President of Sales in New York City. Literally, the couple will choke on the Big Apple, but maybe for their own good.George Kellerman is appointed for a job interview at 9 am, a formality as he thinks he's is in a shoo-in for the job, the airplane will arrive at night, before 8 pm so he'll have the time to a fancy dinner with Gwen at the Four Seasons restaurant and then a romantic night in the Waldorf Astoria hotel, everything is planned. But there's a way why Arabs say « If God wills » because naturally, nothing goes as planned. As soon as the plane starts circling around for hours and hours swallowing in the process the Four Seasons dinner, and when it lands to Boston while the luggage with George's medics for ulcer are you know that the film will follow a simple pattern : « whatever can go wrong, will go wrong » you've heard it before, Murphy's law, a feeling of deja vu from a movie you probably watched before that one ''Planes, Trains and Automobiles'', and indeed, the couple is never short of bad luck, one that get to the smallest detail. After George and Gwen wait for two hours to get at the train restaurant, only bread and olives are left, talk about a stretch from the restaurant dinner and even the airplane meal George didn't let his wife had because he still thought he could make it in the Four Seasons.You can't even label the couple as unlucky for they have that subtle thing we call in my family 'luck in bad luck'. If anything had made him miss the train from Boston, the interview would've been canceled, but they get enough luck to keep moving toward their Holy Grail, just sleeping in the hotel. And the taxi strike didn't make it easier, nor the fact that George forgot to confirm the hotel booking. The power of the film is to avoid a feeling of repetitiveness by toying with the funniest bureaucratic procedures related to transportations and make them the source of excitement in a sort of « what next ? » anticipation.It feels like a gimmicky movie, but this is a script written by Neil Simon, who made some of the funniest movies from simple situations, ''The Odd Couple'' was one of them. And of course, the performances of Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis elevate the film to another level, because they're not just a couple, but they work like a Laurel and Hardy pair, he's the maniac husband who's trying to prove his wife that he means business and ask every uncooperative worker for his address and name, while she sort of plays it like her mousy Oscar-winning character in « Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf » a devoted wife whose only satisfaction comes from her husband's but whose patience isn't unlimited. We also wait for the moment she won't stand it anymore because that will mean they're in serious trouble and George will finally read the hidden message.Indeed, something progressively evolves as George get less and less confident and Gwen more and more tired of all these tiresome manifestations of hard luck. The evolution reaches its paroxysm during a beautiful climax where George who finally got the job announces it to Gwen, and she finally lets the most beautiful part of her personality bloom in a tender and serious moment where she questions her husband's decision. Why not taking a lesson from this hard day in New York and get back to their quiet town in Ohio. The look on Jack Lemmon's face is of a hypnotic fascination that foresees more dramatic roles to come, you can tell he loves his wife and knows she's her love life from what she says. And I loved that very scene because it touched a sensitive chord. Lately, I had to go back to Paris for a job interview, I took the train, the subway, went through the crowded streets, the same places I spent almost a third of my life in. And for some reason, I started asking myself if I really wanted to get back to that again, if it was worth it.Is it worth it? That's the question the film asks, the tone is comical and lighthearted but never underestimate a movie written by Neil Simon, played by the late Lemmon and Dennis, and also by ''Love Story'' director, behind the laughs, it provides many touching moments and powerful insights about commitment whether professional or marital, but it doesn't forget to bring you a little twist at the end. A cocktail of gags and sweetness to savor without moderation !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd forgotten how funny this is. Jack Lemon and his wife, Sandy Dennis, are flying from Ohio to New York for Lemon's job interview at a major advertising firm. They'll dine at the Four Seasons, spend the night at the Waldorf, and the next morning Lemon will breeze through the interview and get the job.Well, as they say, it's a long road that has no turning. Murphy's law applies. If it can go wrong, it will.The airplane is rerouted to Boston, their luggage is lost, their room wasn't held for them, they're mugged, swept up in a political demonstration, they get lost, and Lemon loses a front tooth after grappling with a stray dog over a half-eaten box of Crackerjacks.One of the most amusing moments comes when they must walk from Grand Central Station to the Waldorf in a downpour. Dennis calculates from the street signs that they have been walking in the wrong direction. Instead of plunging headlong into frenzy, a drenched Lemon simply stands there, staring at her silently, a stupid grin plastered on his face. The moment endures.Lemon is fine in the role of the nervous out-of-towner. He runs the gamut from desperation to full-blown mania. Sandy Dennis is a little annoying though. Sensible at the first obstacles, she becomes increasingly shrill and nasal, and those teeth! It doesn't help Lemon a bit.The film reminds me of a movie like "Memphis Belle", about a bomber that runs into every conceivable problem during its run over Europe. Everything that happens is, in itself, probable, but the combination of problems, the way they are piled atop one another, is astronomically remote. But that's part of what makes "The Out Of Towners" funny. It's as if the whole city were against them, and not just the city but the abiotic factors -- fog that blocks their landing at New York, the rain that leverages their misery, the tunnels in the park that provides a haven for thugs, nasty dogs, and lost little boys.Quincy Jones musical score will transport you back to 1970, with its Burt Bacharach harmonies and chorus. The film cheats a bit. New York City was a dangerous place in 1970, but the miscreants we see -- the looters and muggers -- are all white, and that's not what New York was afraid of in 1970. But you can't have such historical reality in a comedy.This was remade recently. Everything is being remade recently. Sometimes re-remade. Not just feature films but television shows like "The Honeymooners" and even television cartoons like "The Flintstones." Lately, there have been Hollywood movies based on video games like "Battleship." Sooner or later, I guess someone will have to admit that the well is dry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Lemmon rescues this good comedy which shoulda been great &gt; there are as many believable and funny scenes as there are unbelievable and just plain dumb scenes which should have hit the cutting room floor.as a NJ-NYer from 1951 to 2009, I loved the location shots of New York in 1970 and the Director and EDitor know just how much time to spend on these classic backdrops.of course, movie comedy is about exaggeration and we can go down of a list of "in reality, they could have easily....". but it's Neil Simon, probably the first American playwright who writes mostly based upon his own New York experiences and knows how to tickle the funnybone especially, of middle class easterners, earnest but constantly being kicked around; not as street savvy as they think they are.I wrote above that Lemmon saves the project, as professional as it is, because, frankly, Sandy Dennis is uncharacteristically awful. And it's not her fault, I surmise &gt; seems the Director does not know if she should just use her beautiful "English accent", throughout, or mix in some real Brooklynese. On the other hand, perhaps his concept of Mrs. Kellerman, is a kind of na?ve, flaky kid, like Edith Bunker &gt; always adoring - restrained but still capable of breaking out in a lecture, if needed.another reason I chose a "6" rating is in the terrible denouement and finale scene. to use a contemporary expression to describe an old movie directorial/literary choice, "what were they thinking?".good to see Meara and Billy Dee Williams, in early roles. (and all those 8 cylinder sedans!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Jack Lemmon wasn't such a theatrical genius this movie would be very sad. Tragically sad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only because I think Jack Lemmon was one of the finest comedic actors to ever appear in films or on stage does this otherwise angry, depressing movie manage to be a little bit entertaining. The grim and hostile tone of the film pushes it out of the realm of farce into the much less comical arena of social realism. The ever tightening circle of doom into which the hapless couple are ensnared is relieved only partially by Jack's masterful performance. His unequaled expertise in portraying an otherwise capable man under extreme duress keeps this bleak, heavy production lurching along. I watched this one immediately after enjoying The Odd Couple on TCM and the drop off in quality is quite precipitous, though to be fair few films measure up to the transcendent heights which that earlier masterpiece attains. Maybe it's also unfair to be comparing this dour film to that hysterical gem, this one apparently is not an actual comedy, no, not at all. It's more a cinematic examination of the deepening psychosis afflicting contemporary society; a clinical dissection of the unraveling American dream. But oddly, it seems intent on trying to convince me that it's really a preposterous, wacky comedy.The secret of comedy is timing, but unfortunately this misguided flick is written, directed and edited with a very poor sense of rhythm, comedic or otherwise. It's clunky and spastic. The beats which set up its gags and jokes are emphatically overstated and melodramatic, as though the real joke is on me for expecting a bigger, funnier punchline. And Sandy Dennis' character is so relentlessly shrill and tedious. But Jack is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The identification of American identity through an American dream.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American director Arthur Hiller's "The Out of Towners" can rightly be hailed as a perfect film for the entire family with its primary focus on the quintessential "American Dream". It is a common knowledge that an American person is identified solely through American dreams. Through the making of this film, Arthur Hiller and his writing partner Neil Simon deftly show all the pressure and stress which an American couple handle in order to land on time for a job interview in New York City, a grand metropolis which remains a city of dreams for many people. New York City has been filmed in a very subtle manner that nobody can remain aloof from its charms. Those who are new to New York City would take immense pleasure in watching the magnetic quality of the city especially the portions which were shot around Central Park and surrounding areas. The film also touches upon various ethical issues as all big cities have their unique ethical mechanisms with which its inhabitants like to identify. This may not be evident to somebody who is not familiar with them. This aspect has also been handled reasonably well in "The Out of Towners" as viewers learn that it is difficult to trust complete strangers in a big city. Lastly, one is aware of the maxim that too much planning goes bust at the last moment. It is conveyed to viewers through actors Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis who shine as a perfect yet whimsical American couple.</fullReview>

Actors Lemmon and Dennis each do an impeccably hilarious job. Lemmon, again, is the epitome of 'perfect timing' and has the material down pat, and Dennis is great at looking jet-lagged and harried. Neither of these actors goes too much over the top as to seem unbelievable, and (personally) their is enough credible 'couple' chemistry to support this.On the Remake: Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn reprised the Kellerman roles in a recent remake of the untouchable Simon original script. There was promise in adding to Lemmon's original 'George' portrayal, but Martin does nothing to improve on the other actors previous comedic timings, and overall portrayal of a neurotic businessman bent on getting every Manhattanite's name down so that he can later sue them for whatever inconvenience he (or his wife) has been subjected to. Hawn only has one notable seen in the remake (as wife 'Gwen'), when she throws her scene of furor at the police station.</fullReview>

The saving grace comes through in the notion that Sandy Dennis' Gwen is so "grounded" yet equally as incredulous as the audience, and her repeated cry, "Oh My God!" reminds us that, it's just one more adventure for her and her husband, masterfully played by Jack Lemmon. While the movie is "extremely" tame by today's standards, it could easily upset your "balance" for at least a day or two afterwards.

Having not seen the film in seven years, I wasn't sure if I would appreciate it as much as in the past. I can honestly say that it still holds up. Neil Simon is a master of great dialogue as we all know, but it's the late Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis who really make the film stand the test of time.

Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis are just marvellous as a middle-aged couple who endure a hellish journey to New York where Lemmon as George Kellerman is due to attend an interview the next morning. The incidents which occur are all totally believable as is Lemmon's character's reaction to them. His long-suffering wife has infinite patience and is an excellent foil to her increasingly irate husband. Only Neil Simon could have written this as brilliantly as he did. He has an ear for the rhythm of speech and the appropriate turn of phrase in any given situation. My wife and I have seen this film a few times and find it funnier each time we see it.

(Sue everyone! Even Corky the dog!) Above that underlying concept, Jack Lemmon, Sandy Dennis and much of the supporting cast deliver terrific performances that are complex enough to be entertaining after multiple viewings.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful, Dreadful, Unfunny, Terrible, Boring, Endless Dreck,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, truth be told, I don't like this movie very much. Now--I'm a HUGE Neil Simon fan, a HUGE Jack Lemmon fan, a HUGE Sandy Dennis fan. How in the world could this movie have gone so wrong? 1. Neil Simon's episodic tale of an obnoxious neurotic and his annoying wife running into one disaster after another in NYC, happening at the rate of probably one screw-up every five minutes, is so relentless--it induced in me a headache of major proportions. The episodes are not really funny, because they are all so unpleasant--seeing Sandy Dennis' foot bleeding after stepping on a twist top bottle cap in the middle of Central Park, watching Jack Lemmon breaking a tooth eating cracker jack, and the relentless parade of stereotypical NYC (circa 1970) loonies contributing to the unpleasant atmosphere of Dante's Inferno transported to Manhattan is so inexorable, one watches the movie in absolute awe at the blatant humorlessness of it all. Instead of being funny, it is noisy, chaotic and relentless. The two hour or so movie feels like it lasts an eternity.2. Jack Lemmon's character is just SO obnoxious and obsessive compulsive and unpleasant, he is a walking talking perforated ulcer. Think of a terrible headache, or earache or toothache that won't go away. That's Jack Lemmon in "The Out-of-Towners"!3. Sandy Dennis says "George" (Jack Lemmon's character's name) I swear to God--maybe 300 or 400 times during the course of the movie. I loved watching Sandy Dennis with her quirks and ticks and unexpected crescendos and decrescendos in her voice in films like "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" and "Up the Down Staircase"--but in this movie, these all just become annoying. But if she didn't keep saying George every 5 seconds in the movie, I probably would have tolerated her a little more. Her final monologue enumerating all the rotten aspects of NYC was a bitter whining recitation at the end of a crappy movie.On paper this movie might have seemed like a sure thing--maybe it read better then the God-awful resulting translation to the big screen. For those of us living in New York City for the past 40 years, this movie feels like a relic from the distant past. In place of the strikes and the crime and the stereotypical rudeness, nowadays, with NY being OZ for most of the rest of the world--the main annoyance in 2010 is that the cost of housing is so exorbitant. But this relic of a film is not a revealing view of NY circa 1970--it's just a dumb trifle, taking pot shots at easy targets, and causing queasiness in the viewing audience. Have your Alka Seltzer or aspirin (mega-doses) at hand when you prepare to watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know, "it's only a movie," but it's a movie that takes totally unfair aim at my city, the greatest city in the world, where anyone with half a brain can see the city isn't at fault for any of the couple's problems.George and Gwen Kellerman, two hicks from Ohio, are flying in so George can accept a job at an interview the next morning. The plane can't land, so off to Boston they go. It is on the plane where we first start to see George as a total moron - he's not too bright, blames everything and everyone else for his own problems, and whines all the time like a child. His wife pretty much just obeys his commands.In Boston, they tell him his luggage is missing, and he flips out. He has to get to NYC, so he finally manages to catch a packed train. Simply renting a car to drive to NYC never seems to cross his mind.In NYC there's a transit strike. A NYC transit strike makes worldwide news. Doesn't he read the paper in Ohio? He gets to his NYC hotel six or seven hours late, and his room is gone, because as his reservation CLEARLY stated, after ten o'clock if they don't hear from you, the room is then open to anyone. Despite that George was too stupid to call the hotel and keep the room for he and his wife, he flips out on them.At the hotel desk, he gets a call from the airport in Boston, his luggage was found and can be at his hotel in the morning. Great news! However, not for George. He yells at the guy and then HANGS UP!! And with nowhere to go at 2:30am, despite George's stupidity of not calling ahead, the hotel kindly offers him a room FREE OF CHARGE at 7am when others leave. He REFUSES THE ROOM!! THE MORON REFUSES THE ROOM!!! So who's fault is it they get mugged, sleep in central park, mug a dog for crackerjacks, get kidnapped by thieves, etc? Who's fault is it that he gets caught in a limo with attacking protesters, a chipped tooth, no bath, no food, no money, etc? New York City's fault? No! GEORGE'S FAULT! HE'S A MORON!! He even makes a big speech on the corner of W. 65th Street how NYC won't beat him. Hey stupid!! YOU are the reason you are in trouble, NOT New York City! And the ending, his wife makes a big speech about how bad NYC is, and that they should go back to Ohio. Hey, GO!! Don't let the door hit you on the way out! His wife is a total dim bulb, and with a husband as moronic as he is, they wouldn't have a chance.There are a few laughs in the film, but really, NYC isn't the culprit here. It's a total fool of a husband who is completely clueless (I know I've said it, but he REFUSES THE ROOM!!) and the dim bulb of a wife who obeys his commands. Forget NYC looking bad - if all couples in Ohio are this idiotic, Ohio must have an average IQ of about three.</fullReview>

The story involves a concatenation of mishaps which are constituted with hoary incidents, befall on the ill-fated couple from a small town in Ohio. George is scheduled to have an interview for a job promotion in NYC, which seems to be a cinch to get. So he arranges a stay in the Waldorf-Astoria, and a fancy dinner in the Four Season with Gwen, but starts with the busy air traffic control and an unexpected heavy fog around Kennedy International Airport, their voyage turns out to be an unabated chain of nightmares, whatever contretemps could possibly happen to the out-of-towners, happens, and they are all heavy-handedly implemented.Jack Lemmon has never looked so jaded and aggrieved, and Sandy Dennis has deteriorated into a ceaseless vent of annoyance as their plight aggravates. The movie is a farce intemperately piles up all possible gags consecutively, without any discretion to varnish a tad of empathy and reasoning onto its rudimentary ballast of cheap laughters. "New York will not stop me", this is the spirit, it is self-boasting individualism Vs. collective machinery of a metropolis, bluntly juxtaposed with a ridicule about bourgeois esprit and a then-topical reference of Cuba. You are aware of the intention, but can hardly buy it for the in-your-face combo-package.How much fun can one get from watching other people's misery? This film provides a feasible answer: nil if you overcook it, that is the unmistakable blunder trips THE OUT-OF-TOWNERS, it's as if you are watching a chapter of FINAL DESTINATION, waiting for something bad regularly occurring but in this case, death is not an option, not even on a hijacked plane to Cuba.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NYC at It's Finest!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been visiting NYC since the early 70's, so I was most interested to see if any fond memories highlighted this collaboration. As a huge fan of Lemon, I knew this film would be first rate. Oy Vey! What a challenge to watch even 5 minutes between commercials for another film.First, you have a high level executive interview which translates, at least to most I assume, this guy has it going on. They used Travel Agencies back then, hence this big time NYC company would use only the best. Of course they would be aware of the perils of taking a late flight the night BEFORE an early appointment which might POSSIBLY lead to difficulties. Hence, right off the bat I am being conned into the ramifications of implausible events.Comedy typically comes from unexpected actions and consequences and when you see them coming at every turn it gets EXTREMELY boring! Whoever read this script and kept laughing every five minutes to give the green light owed Mr. Simon a HUGE debt or knew where the bodies were buried.I believe Lemon accepted the role without reading the script and this explains his involvement in such a deleterious role. Dennis was bad enough in WAOVW, so was prepared for yet another annoying performance.Perhaps if you had him coming to town to visit a dying relative and develop the comic action in the ICU this would have more credibility. I advise anyone considering this worse than drivel of a film to complete avoidance.I can only recommend for those who want to see reminders of the old NYC and how it was regarded as a languid, sorrowful, corrupt city and how mightily it reincarnated and rose from the ashes to become the shining star of destination locations in the world.Simon, this was your town and no one wanted to live there anyways then, so why the F U??? Please explain if we ever meet.</fullReview>

Sandy Dennis plays his suffering wife who sometimes borders on the irritating with her whining.A very funny script provided by Neil (ODD COUPLE) Simon, and brought to hilarious life by a superbly neurotic performance from Lemmon.

		<shortDescription>kicking off the Golden Era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many regard the seventies as a pretty solid era in the short history of movie making. Students who want to enter ANY area of the cinema should be required to watch this film. Every area is as solid as a rock - script, acting, art direction, location, music, bit players, editing... this is as good as it gets. Many people are put off by movies that have anxiety and tension as it's central theme, that is understandable, but if you enjoyed AFTER HOURS or THE HOT ROCK, this film is for you. Comedic timing does not get any better than Jack Lemmon in this movie. And for any acting student who has been taught that their character should have an arc, watch this movie and then fire your acting teacher. Jack Lemmon has one note in this movie, and he hammers that note like the soundtrack to Eyes Wide Shut, with outstanding effectiveness. If you are under thirty and are joining the growing numbers of young movie buffs who are discovering the greatness of the seventies, this one won't disappoint you. And if you enjoy it... check out</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hell in New York</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, this was indeed a very good movie. Now, this hopefully will not deter people from visiting New York City. It's certainly improved since the horrid '70s. And back in the late '60s, early '70s, many people went through hell. George and Gwen were two. As they finally land in Boston (not their destination) they miss the train to Grand Central Station, finally get on a crowded one with nothing to eat, get caught in the rain, held up, kidnaped, mugged, slept in Central Park, chased by policeman, kicked off bus,- no money- and a hell of a lot more. So, looking for a bad time? Go to New York. Dont forget to watch your travel video-"The Out Of Towners". This should cover every aspect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thirty one years after I first saw the "Out-Of-Towners", I still think it's one of Neil Simon's best scripts. Frankly, I'd forgotten huge chunks, but as soon as it got to them trying to get their luggage at the airport, it all came back, and I found myself roaring with laughter before the gags, and hilarious one-liners began to come thick and fast. Sure, Lemmon's over the top as the control-freak executive, but so what. However, It's only now that I realise just how great Sandy Dennis in the role of George's long-suffering life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upon hearing of Jack Lemmon's passing I decided to revisit "The Out of Towners" again as a tribute to the man and his enormous talents. Having not seen the film in seven years, I wasn't sure if I would appreciate it as much as in the past. I can honestly say that it still holds up. Neil Simon is a master of great dialogue as we all know, but it's the late Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis who really make the film stand the test of time. There is lots of funny situations and great dialogue. The film was unjustly dismissed by most critics and although it isn't perfect, it's still a very good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grumpy Middle-Aged Man!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Out-of-Towners", Neil Simon's 1970 black comedy could have been titled appropriately enough "Grumpy Middle-Aged Man", because Jack Lemmon acts far more grumpier here than he did in both "Grumpy Old Men" comedies. And boy is he a pleasure to watch. Some people may find this movie irritating, but I found it to be hilarious from start to finish. Lemmon plays a stubborn businessman from Ohio who, along with wife Sandy Dennis, goes to New York City for an important job interview. But what they thought was going to be a trip that they'll never forget turns into a comic nightmare. Just about everything goes wrong. Their plane runs into fog just as they're about to land in New York and ends up getting rerouted to Boston. They're luggage gets lost. They board the wrong train trying to get to New York. Their hotel reservation ends up cancelled because of tardiness. They get robbed. And so on. Once the first bad thing happens ten minutes into the picture, Lemmon is constantly gripping and complaining for the rest of the movie. And it had me cracking up. I laughed out loud quite often while watching "The Out-of-Towners" because Simon keeps repeatedly piling on the mishaps for the poor couple. It's just one bad situation after another and it never seems to want to stop. Lemmon is wonderfully crabby throughout, and Dennis is delightfully whinny by his side. "The Out-of-Towners" is one very funny movie, and it's far better than the mediocre remake from 1999 starring Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn. Stick with this one.***1/2 (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must have seen it five times over the years. I am not one to watch a movie more than once, but this one is so good, so funny, it must be seen time and again. It tells the truth about urban life. Lemmon is priceless. It's his best role. He should have gotten an Oscar for it. But Hollywood doesn't like to reward comedy. Drama is deemed deeper. Neil Simon is one of the sharpest minds because he has a golden heart. He captures the utter sense of impotence, the nightmarish aspects of urban life. It is funny and scary. Lemmon and wife, utterly defeated by New York City, step into a church to pray, but are immediately evicted, because there is a TV rehearsal going on! Even one's "divine rights" are taken away. Movies are seldom this gutsy. Most fail to rock the boat. This movie is downright subversive. I am surprised it was made at all, because it is a frontal attack on what passes for modern life.

		<shortDescription>Laugh Until You Cry!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First and foremost, this film is defined by brilliant writing of Mr. Simon. Like many of his other works, it is the combination of impossibly comical situations and memorable characters that makes this one truly enjoyable. The film calls upon the actors to deliver stand-out performances, transforming the characters playing out this comedy into people who can convince us to suspend our disbelief and have a laugh. And they do deliver. The uptight character played by Jack Lemmon (a character bearing an uncanny resemblance to Felix Unger of "The Odd Couple") is hilarious because of the unflinching, consistent rigidity lent to the part by the performer. As the string of events becomes more implausibly horrific (each comically punctuated by Mr. Lemmon's insistence that the person responsible is being added to "his list"), the viewer can become totally caught up in the comedy, totally involved in the adventure. I believe that this film is a classic in the sense that the humor can still be appreciated to day, and that it did not need to rely on a sensory attack of the audience in order to keep their attention. Without special effects, a super-hot leading lady, a guy with a six-pack, or even profanity, this movie is at once sophisticated, enjoyable, and entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Type Of Film That Makes You Hate Leonard Maltin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously, Mr. Maltin has something against Mr. Neil Simon's work. He allowed us to know that by trashing every film that he ever made without the colaboration of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau - managing to find something wrong about his releases movie after movie, from the hilarious 'Barefoot In The Park' to the outstanding 'The Last Of The Red Hot Lovers'. Certainly, he has his own reasons - yet, we have nothing to do with his problems, and, through the view of the common man, this film is a contemporary gem. Mr. Simon brought us the ultimate modern man nightmare, as we behold the Kellermans suffering from moment to moment, involved in the most utterly disgraceful happenings on a dark, scary New York City. George's hopes of obtaining a good job on a plastics company is ruined as he takes a painful glance on the city's reality and the strange, corrupted characters they run into. The chemistry between both Sandy Dennis and Jack Lemmon is so successful that we can't help frowning when the movie is over... Ms. Dennis' portrait of the faithful puppy of a wife that is Gwen, is absolutely terrific, as she sighs throughout the movies misadventures, replying only to her husbands' irritating reactions with an ever so comprehensive 'Oh My Goooood'... another high point of the film is Quincy Jones' great musical score. This is a great motion picture, no matter what Leonard Maltin says about it.</fullReview>

It concerns a suburban couple from Ohio flying to New York City for the husband's important job interview, getting re-routed to Boston, finally arriving in the Big Apple during a rainstorm AND a transit strike (with no luggage). Ostensibly about the craziness that comes with traveling, the only calamities we see are happening to Jack Lemmon's ulcerous George Kellerman--everyone else seems to keep their cool and comes out okay. Lemmon is full of nervous tics even before his character arrives at the airport, and Simon starts off on such a neurotic high-note that nothing which follows manages to surprise us. A masochistic comedy, it has been fashioned all on one sour level, throwing reality out the window for the sake of mean-spirited comic chaos. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Twin Oaks, Ohio, George Kellerman (Jack Lemmon) is invited for a job interview in New York. On the eve, he travels with his wife Gwen Kellerman (Sandy Dennis), expecting to have their second honeymoon, in a night of the dreams in a fancy hotel and restaurant. However, first due to the bad weather in the N.Y. airport, they land in Boston; and later, due to a strike in the means of transportation in N.Y., they have a night of nightmare. "The Out-of-Towners" would be a very funny movie, but the nasty and arrogant character of Jack Lemmon, silly and ridiculous, does not fit with a man expecting to occupy a VP position and it is almost impossible to feel any sympathy for him and his situation. All the time, the guy wants to note the name of a person to sue him, and if it is funny in the first or maybe second situation, this insistence annoyed me. The voice of Sandy Dennis is another point that irritated me, with her timbre. Indeed, this story has a good premise, wasted in a dull character. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Forasteiros em Nova York" ("Strangers in New York")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No getting around it, Jack Lemmon was a fabulous actor and in this film, there is no exception to that statement.His trip to N.Y. along with his wife, played by the late Sandy Dennis, turns into a comedy of errors. Yes, life in the big apple was rough at the time this film was made in 1970, but everything happening all at once. It's a big exaggerated, don't you think?The weak link in this film was Miss Dennis. Far better in "Up the Down Staircase," and other films, she comes across at first as a wife who repeats exactly what her husband tells her to say. As their situation becomes more dire, she attains a degree of independence but her voice is upsetting. We reach the point where we can't wait for their nightmare to end in this city.At least the ending showed that you can't blame everything on N.Y. I wonder how Woody Allen would have handled this type of comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess I'll never get Neil Simon. I know he's received a lot of awards and accolades, but almost none of his works do anything for me, with the notable exception of "The Lonely Guy," but that screenplay was based on Bruce Jay Friedman's material, not Simon's own. Some become great, but only after they've been reshaped by others, like the classic "Odd Couple" series starring Tony Randall and Jack Klugman.This movie is average Simon. Yes, I know it's supposed to be a comedy about how a night in New York becomes hell for a married couple. But the problem is there is absolutely nothing likable about this couple. George is a blowhard who's always taking down names and threatening to sue when he doesn't get his way. The hotel gave away his room because he didn't show up or call before 10 p.m. as the terms of his reservation stated? He'll sue! An airline rep tells him that they can't send his luggage because JFK Airport is still fogged in? He'll sue! What do you want, George, that they charter a plane and parachute your bags to you? But if George is obnoxious, his wife Gwen is like fingernails on chalkboard. I could die happy if I never hear "Oh, my Goooood" in her nasal whine again. She is so dumb that you wonder why George or any man would stay with her. She gives away his wallet and watch for absolutely no reason. If I was from Ohio, I'd be offended at how stupid these characters make Ohioans look. I think this would be a fine, funny comedy if it was about bad things happening to good people, but it's actually a film about bad things happening to stupid people mostly through their own fault. The vast majority of their problems are caused by George's pigheadedness, from refusing to eat on the plane to refusing to get out of the police car.But this seems to be Simon's habit. His characters usually have no redeeming value. Lemmon &amp; Matthau's "odd couple" in his movie wasn't likable. It took the aforementioned Randall and Klugman (plus good writers) to massage Felix and Oscar into people we could like and cheer on despite their foibles. (Which Simon managed to undo with his eminently forgettable Odd Couple II.) They could still be annoying at times, but you wouldn't find it inconceivable that they would have friends. On the other hand, I'd pay good money to get away from Gwen and George and was happy at the end when they decided to stay in Ohio. The only good thing about this movie is being able to see NYC as it was in 1969.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hell is a city much like New York</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To paraphrase Shelley, Hell, in the seventies, was a city much like New York. The city was widely seen as dysfunctional, a dirty, polluted, crime-ridden place with failing public services. Although (or possibly because) he is himself a New Yorker, this is the view of the city to which Neil Simon panders in his "The Out-of-Towners".George Kellerman is a business executive from Twin Oaks, a fictional small town in Ohio. He has applied for a promotion to a more senior position with his company, and is offered a job interview in New York. He makes the trip with his wife Gwen, having made reservations to stay in a five star hotel and to eat in an expensive restaurant. What follows next is a series of unfortunate events, long before Lemony Snicket first used that phrase. Their plane is unable to land at New York airport because of bad weather and has to divert to Boston, where they find that their luggage has gone missing. They just manage to catch the last train to New York, but when they get there they discover that there is a transit strike and the taxis, buses and subways are not running. They are forced to walk to their hotel in a heavy rainstorm, only to find that because of their late arrival their reservation has been cancelled and their room let to someone else. Attempting to find an alternative hotel, they are mugged and all their money is stolen, which means they are forced to spend the night in Central Park.After further misadventures, including being caught up in a robbery and mistaken for a child molester, George, against all the odds, makes it to his interview, where he is offered the job, which would involve his moving to New York. He decides, however, that he has had quite enough of the city and its inconveniences, and declines the offer.The basic premise of the film is quite an amusing one, but the main problem is that the characters are too unsympathetic. George- pompous, self-righteous, quick-tempered and testy- put me in mind of that great seventies comic character, John Cleese's Basil Fawlty. His constant threats to sue anyone who crosses him are an obvious warning sign (especially from a British perspective- we have always regarded the American obsession with litigation as evidence of a deep-rooted flaw in the national character). Fawlty's wife Sybil, however, was always portrayed as calm, rational and capable, whereas Gwen is just as annoying as George, if not more so. Whereas he is aggressive, she is passive-aggressive, a neurotic complainer with an irritatingly whiny voice. One wonders why their marriage has lasted so long; presumably they stick together on the basis that "By any other arrangement, four people would be unhappy instead of two." (As Tennyson said of the notoriously discordant marriage of Thomas and Jane Carlyle).Cleese- wisely- refused to make a film version of "Fawlty Towers"; he realised that characters like Basil are, like medicine, best taken in small doses. An hour and a half of George is about an hour too much. Although I have admired Jack Lemmon as a comic actor in films like "Some Like it Hot" or "How to Murder Your Wife", "The Out-of-Towners" is not one of his best films. As for Sandy Dennis's Gwen, five minutes of her are too much. (Dennis, with her breathless way of speaking, fluttering hands and generally mannered style, was for me the sort of method actor who brings to mind the old saying that there's madness in The Method).George and Gwen are often the victims of circumstance, and at times it is impossible not to sympathise with them, whatever their own personal failings. They are often badly treated, not only by the mugger and the robbers but also by those who are supposed to be helping them, like that dreadful hotel clerk who thinks that he is being polite and professional when in reality he is just being supercilious and patronising. (Those reviewers who criticise George and Gwen for not phoning the hotel should remember that there were no mobile phones in 1970 and that it was therefore not possible to make a telephone call from an aircraft or train). Nevertheless, on too many other occasions they are the authors of their own misfortunes. I felt that this was a film that would have been funnier if the main characters had been more likable. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>6* / should have been a 9 *</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, one would think the appeal of this movie would be because of their performances and characters. However, it is, in my opinion, "in spite of" these. Both George and Gwen are surprisingly unsympathetic, as are the leads' performances. They're from Cleveland, for goodness sake, not, say Dry Ridge, Kentucky, and yet they act as naive and clueless in both Boston and New York City as if they were Mars. Neil Simon throws-in everything but the proverbial "kitchen sink" in his comedies (and I'll bet there's one of them somewhere in one of them). Not only does George do a number of stupid things, he does them in an off-putting, sour, obnoxious manner - and again, displays a naivete and non-plussed demeanor that nobody who is an executive with a major firm, in a large city would reveal (again, New York shouldn't be that baffling for such a person). However, the movie is still interesting to watch in spite of these annoyances. Viewing it today also adds a further enjoyment to see New York as it was one-third + a century past. It is fascinating to see the scene of Cuban ex-patriots picketing against Castro, the signs referring to his tenure which was then a decade, and knowing now that this tenure now approaches the 50-year point. (However on feels about Fidel, you have to admire his longevity.) Mark this one down a point each for: lack of character appeal; the leads' fore-mentioned naivete; Lemmon's silly approach in finally reaching his interview; and the film's weak ending -- give it 6 stars.</fullReview>
