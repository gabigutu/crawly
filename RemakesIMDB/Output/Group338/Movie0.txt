		<shortDescription>banal remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Neil Simon's script for the original 1970 hit, "The Out-of-Towners," was, essentially, a one-joke skit stretched out to a feature-length film. Starring Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis as two suburbanites from Ohio who experience a nightmare of frustrating complications when they hit the Big Apple, the film managed to generate some laughs as well as a great deal of grating repetitiousness. The 1999 remake, with Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn in the central roles, manages to be a far worse film. The original at least seemed grounded in some sense of reality as the couple fell victim to a believable, if overstated, series of tourist mishaps; this version spins off into slapstick delirium, going so far as to have its main characters actually swinging on hotel signs six stories above street level and John Cleese as a snippy concierge prancing around in lady's clothing to Donna Sommer's "Bad Girls." Also, in the original, Jack Lemmon seemed determined to really take on all the people who arrayed themselves against him and the film conveyed a real sense of this implacable, almost malevolent force known as NEW YORK coming down with all its might on this innocent couple from the Midwest. In the remake, Steve Martin seems strangely passive and unharried and the victory-over-the-city theme comes along only at the very end. Without that added dimension of epic frustration, the new film robs the original of whatever audience identification it might once have had and simply devolves into an undisciplined display of unfunny slapstick.Martin, Hawn and Cleese are game players, but this "Out-of-Towners" should indeed have been driven out of town!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Cleese Is A Bad Girl!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time I think about that movie, I always laugh over John Cleese's character, Mr. Mersault.He's rude, sophisticated in the outside, but he's also a transvestite who loves to dress in ladies' clothes dancing to Donna Summer's Bad Girl! And when I hear Donna Summer's song, it reminds me of John Cleese.Another scene I liked was when they were in the limo, and a drugged Steve Martin describes his wife as being "Frisky!. He tells his wife to say that word as well as Mr. Mersault. The hotel manager loved that new word, "Frisky!".Years ago, I went to see John Pizzarelli in concert. Afterwards, I met him &amp; told him I liked him the movie. He started singing "That Old Black Magic". Here's the zinger, I told him that his performance was very "Frisky"! Pizzarelli laughed at my comment!That made the movie funny for me!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went to the sneak preview, I was afraid they would give me 'Runaway Bride', but they managed to come up with something so full of nothing, that I almost left during the break (and I have never done that), and I wouldn't have had to convince my friends. This thing is filled with jokes that I would be ashamed to come up with, like a candy bar stuck in the machine. We have never seen that before right? At one point Steve Martin is sitting in a Limo, and realizes he swallowed an XTC pill, then jumps out of the car and starts to rape a tree. John Cleese was the only funny part, but do yourselves a favour, and go see 'Runaway Bride'. I am sure it's much better. Dennis Pennis was right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Re Written?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Out of Towners could have easily been called The Empty Nesters, or perhaps The Empty Plotters. Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin play Alice and Henry, a husband and wife of 27 years who's last child, (he's in his twenties) is tearfully sent off to Europe early in the film. He's not crying, they are, or are likely to. Anyway the parents flinch and then head off from their hick home town in Ohio to New York.Henry has a job interview to attend and we all know what middle aged, middle order executives looking for a job might run in to, at least in an intelligent script written properly for the nineties.The Out Of Towners was based on a screenplay penned by Neil Simon in the early 70's. The story has been re written for this version but it seems that the comedy slant was firmly in the sights of the producers. The plot was therefore left high and dry. It needed a much heavier rewrite.Henry and Alice have both been in advertising, but Alice has given the game away while she's been mothering the children. Henry is tired and a bit dowdy. It would be expected that a truly modern script would have found Alice moving back into her old career and Henry taking on home duties.Henry says as much in the film! Their daughter has also been accruing horrendous credit card debts on cash stricken Dad's card. This is glossed over in happy land Hollywood. And what's to become of Alice? She's lost for a career.So this emasculated script is left to flounder and to rely on a good deal of slapstick. Neil Simon's clever dialogue is largely gone, and the plot is without depth.We're left with a good deal of arm flapping, particularly from Goldie Hawn. As I write this, The First Wives Club (much, much funnier than The Out Of Towners) is on TV in the same room and there's Goldie again, arms a flapping, bum a poutin'. If there's a chair either Henry or Alice will fall over it, and as is the way these days, if there's a buffoon sidekick, he'll be gay. But still, except for it's contrived, energetic humour, which some patrons will enjoy immensely, The Out Of Towners does work reasonably well. There are one or two warm smiles, and perhaps a laugh or two, but really a bit more heart and common sense and a dose of plot credibility would have been an advantage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inconsistent comedy with okay jokes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always enjoyed Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn; however, I'm not to sure they work to well as a comedy duo. In one of Martin's previous roles he had played a dramatic role in "The Spanish Prisoner", which seemed to fit him better than play a comedic part. The jokes in this movie seemed to be old and unoriginal. I can't deny that this film was all bad; I did enjoyed bits and pieces of it; however, it seemed like it had been done before under the guise of a different movie title. It just did not have originality for me to keep my attention. It is a light hearted film that is worth seeeing at home for rent. I am just happy I didn't spend money to see at the theatres.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THIS MOVIE IS SO BORING AND YOU WONT LAUGH ONCE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately, this movie is so bad. The original Out of Towners was manic and very funny, of course they used the script written by Neil Simon. For some reason Neil Simons script is not used in this film so it falls flat time and time again. Even the audience I was with never laughed. The direction is very slow and tedious and when there is a joke it is given away so the joke dies i.e. The couple having sex in the park. They announce it is a lighting ceremony for New York, well we all know the lights are going to come on and we will be able to see cute and mugging Goldie &amp; Steve do a bit of slap stick. The whole movie winds up being like this...a joke is set up and given away. Why isn't Goldies hair ever even messed up in the movie. You will also notice every close up of Goldie (they use a very intense soft lens). I suggest you rent the original with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, that's if you want to laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I despise Goldie Hawn usually, and I found her very funny and touching in this movie as a supportive wife who's sacrificed her career for her children and now hopes to "suck the marrow" out of life. Steve Martin, as always, is hilarious. He is partially reprising his role in the BRILLIANT "Planes, Trains, and Automobiles" with a vengeance in this film. His attempt at controlling his demeanor at the car rental place by keeping a big smile on his face was really funny. "This sign should say 'We have car.' honey!" The homage to "Mrs. Robinson" looking through Goldie Hawns' legs at a sheepish looking Steve Martin took me by surprise as well.And, what more can you say about John Cleese? The man is nothing if not funny in everything he does. He is the anti-Fawlty in this movie, and he has a fairly juicy part as well, so look to him for some great laughs as well.Don't listen to all these people with no sense of humor. This isn't a classic film, but it's MUCH better than people have been saying. A little cheesy, a lot of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment for fans of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being that I was a fan of the original, I found this film to be a complete disappointment. Who thought that they could remake the Out-Of-Towners? It was a stupid move actually. George and Gwen Kellerman are now George and Nancy Clark (Played by Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn). This time they are left with empty-nest syndrome after their son leaves for London. With nothing to do, George needs to go to New York because of a job interview that he desperately needs being that he was let go from his previous job after 23 years. The only thing is that Nancy doesn't know this. But she does nearing the middle of the film. A few jokes are resurrected from the original and still bring a smile to those that watched and enjoyed the original. Other than that, the rest of the movie is a complete disappointment from start to finish.Don't rush so fast to see this one. It is better to wait until it comes out on video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice, warm hearted, funny little comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been a big fan of Steve Martin, and hilarious 80's comedies like 'Trains Planes and Automobiles', so thats why I decided to rent this film. And I can tell you, I was not disappointed! Its not an hilarious movie, but it is funny from beginning to end. The mishaps that Goldie and Steve go through are sometimes predictable, but are always good for a chuckle. And John Cleese just steals the show. I have not seen the 1970 version, but I found this one pleasant and light hearted. I love watching 'endless mishap' comedies like National Lampoon's Vacation and 'Trains Planes and Automobiles', and this is another one to add to my collection. Steve Martin, you are king! And I can;t understand everyones negative comments on this film - maybe they were expecting just too much.</fullReview>

This could be the worst thing that ever was made, and I don't just mean movies, I'm suggesting the worst of ANY item ever put together by human beings on this Earth. I would expect Goldie Hawn to be a part of this....garbage (and I am being nice) but Steve Martin, well, he HAS done some crap, but he should be so ashamed of himself that he never tries to "act" in another movie. There should be a movement, lead by people who know what the original was, to have this...thing... stricken from the archives of film, to be removed and all remnants of it eliminated, so as to not be associated in any way, shape or form, to this...thing. After reading the good reviews on this? I am so embarrassed to actually have a membership card to the human race. Wow. Wow. Again.....Wow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Does Hollywood Put Out This Trash?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who saw the original 1970 movie knows how an excellent cast, script, and director can put together a comedy masterpiece. By the same token, it's easy to see how the opposite of that can create another insipid Hollywood bore-a-thon! This movie was pathetic! Had it not been for John Cleese (a comic genius), I would have walked out about 15 minutes into this dreadful waste of celluloid.Neil Simon wouldn't write another screenplay for this version (he said that he couldn't improve on the first), and I'm surprised that after this cinematic fiasco he wouldn't sue for defamation of humor!Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis did such a wonderful job in the original, what were the producers thinking about when they cast this one? How could the director and editor look at these scenes and think any of them were funny? I don't know, but one thing I do know---it's no surprise why foreign and independent movies are becoming more and more popular.......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the original, Jack Lemmon at his best. Great story, typical Neil Simon script. I'm not a Sandy Dennis fan, but she was very good in this role, surprisingly.Two of my favorite comedic actors are Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin. I grew up on them. But, they just don't cut the mustard in this remake. I can't place my finger on it, but it just isn't funny. It's not just the writing, it's the actors and their direction.I was so excited when this movie was released. Who doesn't love John Cleese? Well, I don't in this role. I did enjoy seeing a great stand-up comic, Steve Mittleman, in a cameo role in the early portion of the film. Mittleman was one of the funniest comics I remember from my childhood days.This movie is a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Banality reigns supreme in this tepid retread.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Goldie Hawn is a wonderful comedy actress; Steve Martin is a wonderful comedy actor; Neil Simon is a wonderful comedy writer; and New York City is a wonderful place to use as a setting for a movie. Yet, this movie is a clunker; it's as flat as a pancake, and an overcooked one at that. Although certain scenes do provoke a laugh, in general this movie simply is not funny. The story is a pure Hollywood comedy potboiler, that is, a formula movie and a poor retread of the 1970 original, which itself wasn't the funniest movie either, but that's for another review. The idea of everything going wrong during a trip is nothing new, but if properly treated it can produce laughs. But in this movie the things that go wrong are so absurd and contrived that the laughs are lost. What happens to the Clarks would not and could not happen to anyone else, hence the movie becomes irrelevant to the audience and loses its meaning as a satire or parody. John Cleese provides some humor as the hotel manager but his presence is limited and in no way comes close to rescuing this movie from its essential banality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible. How can it even be called a remake?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of the original movie with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis. So you can imagine how excited I was to see what they might have done with it. Unfortunately, it turned out that instead of seeing what they had done WITH it, I was saddened to see what they had done TO it. I have read many places where Troll 2 is considered the worst movie ever made, and I agree it is pretty cheezy. But as far as a really bad movie, this one out-does Troll 2 in every possible way. Shame on Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn for accepting to make this abomination! For one thing, it has nothing remotely akin to the original script of Neil Simon's. The basic premise is similar...New York, job interview, mishaps. That's about it. The comedy(?) is nothing but stupid slapstick crap that I often refer to as cheap and easy. I like Steve Martin, but I keep wondering why he keeps doing these horrible remakes of good classics (e.g. Cheaper By The Dozen). I issue this review as a warning against seeing this waste of time. From here on, watch it, but at your own risk. Don't say I didn't warn you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plain, Strained &amp; Automobiles ? very basic and lazy stuff that is only amusing occasionally</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Henry and Nancy Clark have been married for 24 years and it is starting to show. Henry has lost his job but has kept it secret and plans to get a new job in New York. Having had their last child move out of the house the day before, Nancy isn't sure what to do with her time and decides to join Henry on his trip to New York. However a fog-bound city sees them diverted to Boston and struggling to get to their destination. Actually getting into Manhattan is only the first challenge in an eventful 24 hours that could only happen in New York!Nothing about this film suggested that it would be anything special; in fact the presence of Marc Lawrence as writer only promised the sort of safely comic humour that he produced with Two Weeks Notice, Miss Congeniality and similar projects. And from the very start it is obvious that Lawrence has produced his usual standard and that director Weisman has no aspirations to do more than churn out a rather derivative but amusing rom-com. So that is just what we get and if that is OK with you then you should be alright, although hardly impressed. The plot bumbles along from one unlikely scenario to the next; most of them are ho-hum but occasionally it tickled me. Most viewers (myself included) will find it all a bit obvious and weak but the undemanding will maybe find it amusing enough to serve as a distraction.Part of the film working (albeit on this level) is the partnership of Martin and Hawn. Even with the rather obvious material to work with, they do work well together and produce some laughs where they may not have existed on the page. Martin is only ever a hair away from mugging but, although not a shade on his former glory, he fits the lazy tone well. Hawn is a bit less convincing but is still quite amusing; the only problem with her is that she has to carry the more emotionally complex character and she can't get that right and mainly just overplays it for easy laughs, robbing the film of the engaging realism that it needed to have if it really wanted to pull off the emotional ending (which of course it doesn't actually want to do!). Cleese is embarrassing and can do nothing with the poor material he is served with ? it is pretty much below him and it shows.Overall then a totally by-the-numbers, obvious little romantic comedy. It is fairly forced and contrived which was a problem but bits of it rose above the rest and generally it provided just enough to be distracting for those in an undemanding mood. However the majority of us will see something that lacks any real effort and it doesn't encourage me to do much into it when watching. The two leads brighten it up a little bit but it is hard not to see the glaring lack of originally and spark at pretty much every turn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Granted, this seems like a good idea. Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn, and John Cleese in a Neil Simon comedy. Where can you go wrong? Watch the movie, and you'll find out.In truth, Martin, the lead, is mis-cast. He's not doing the great slapstick he's known for, from movies like "The Jerk", but instead plays a sort of in-between character that doesn't work. Hawn, with no one to play off of, is terrible. Cleese is the only even partially funny member.To top it off, the plot is pretty stupid. I can't say how much of it may have been changed, but the characters seem to lack the slightest bit of common sense. They blunder through New York, not doing anything right, and unfortuneatly, nothing funny. Not only is the whole premise completely unbelievable, it seems to give the message that people who don't live in New York aren't very bright, a theme repeated throughout the movie.In summation, instead of seeing this, go rent the original "Odd Couple" again.</fullReview>

The writing was horrible, the acting was horrible and I did not laugh once. I knew there would be problems the moment Goldie Hawn got on the plane and fell down. It was so out of place. The characters were different in every scene and there was absolutely no continuity. If you can't tell, I think this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

I found the additional sub-stories unnecessary and the deviations they took from the original to be maddening.

Don't waste your time on this one ... and to Steve and Goldie i say: you owe an apology to the memory of Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis for taking part in this travesty. The sad thing is that the casting was perfect, but the script and story such an injustice to two wonderful actors and a to such a wonderful original movie. This is one case where the remake doesn't touch the original - but could have if done properly.</fullReview>

This thing should have been smothered at birth.I hope John Cleese got paid a lot for having his name attached to this disaster.

		<fullReview>Look at the pedigree behind this film. It's based on a play by Neil Simon (The Odd Couple), it was written by Marc Lawrence (Music and Lyrics) and stars Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn. It should have been a huge hit.In fact it's a lousy film. Thin characters doing clearly irrational things. Martin brings likability to every role he plays, but here he's floundering. Goldie Hawn acts as his straight man well, but she's underused.And then along comes John Cleese. Now, I don't find him that funny at the best of times, but when he's clearly playing another Basil Fawlty type role it's even worse.A poor film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As was the original, the remake of "The Out of Towners" is a comedy about a series of mishaps that befall a naive Ohio couple when they venture to New York City. Their plane is rerouted to Boston. They fail to catch a train from there to the Big Apple. Then they rent a car, which they wreck minutes after arriving in Manhattan. Things go downhill from there.'Fine' as 'fine' can be, this new version of Neil Simon's tale of city lunacy has its moments, mostly thanks to the brief but welcome stiff upper lip of John Cleese, but doesn't offer much more. Hawn and Martin are perfectly decent as a team, but it's Cleese who steals the show. He steals every scene he appears in and outshines both the film's "stars" whenever they appear in the same shot. Also, director Sam Weissman offers a good looking comedy, with plenty of cityscapes and chases, especially during the night time up at Central Park. The bit of our leads under the bridge in the shadows is actually rather beautiful. Directing and Technical Credits are Average, nothing special... In fact, the Whole Film has a "Nothing Special" kind of Feel about it, no one except the three Principle Performers seem to be trying very hard, but If you Accept that Going In, you'll have a Lot more fun with it.Overall rating: 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Out-of-Towners (1999): Dir: Sam Weisman / Cast: Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn, John Cleese, Mark McKinney, Oliver Hudson: Remake of the 1970 comedy starring Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis. It is about new territory and experiences starring Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn as a married couple. Martin is fired from his job but wishes not to alarm Hawn so he doesn't inform her that his travel to New York is for a job interview. They are bombarded with a series of incidences that mean little to the story. They lose their luggage, get mugged, get arrested, scale hotel walls, etc. Directed by Sam Weisman who previously made the dreadful George of the Jungle and this is not much of an improvement. Martin and Hawn shared great comedic chemistry in Housesitter but here their roles are props for bad writing. John Cleese appears as a snobbish desk clerk in what appears to be a tribute to his Fawlty Towers role. Nobody else can elevate this farce above the gutter area either. The original film regarded the reality of unfamiliarity to surroundings and culture. This remake merely takes gifted comedians and sends them through endless situations that we have seen countless times. What a waste of talent. For a superior vacation check out National Lampoon's Vacation and its worthwhile sequels. This is empty entertainment opting to replace any message with stupidity. Score: 3 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the second of two teamings of stars Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin. The first had been "HouseSitter" in 1992. Whilst Hawn has aged a lot in the seven years since, Martin still looks exactly the same. Plot In A Paragraph: A remake of the 1970 Neil Simon comedy follows the adventures of a couple, Henry (Martin) and Nancy Clark (Hawn), who find misfortune at every turn while in New York City for a job interview.Goldie Hawn doesn't make many movies, so when she does, I expect a certain level of quality. Sadly this doesn't deliver as it is totally laugh free. A definite low point in the CV's of both Hawn and Martin. I enjoyed the little reference to a previous Martin movie, "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" when he failed to get a Plane and Train to New York, before renting an automobile. I also thought Alan, Henry and Nancy's son, being played by Goldie Hawn's real son, Oliver Hudson (Adam from TV's "Rules Of Engagement") was a nice touch too. However John Cleese's character, Mr. Mersault, a hotel manager, just seemed to be there to evoke memories of Basil Fawlty from his TV show "Fawlty Towers".In summary Goldie Hawn remains watchable as always, but these are not ninety of her better minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an unnecessary remake to the 1970 Arthur Hiller classic of the same name. It takes a much more lighthearted approach as oppose to the gritty (and comical) events from the original film. Also how can you possibly resist the presence of Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis in the original? They were like two peas in a pod whereas Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn felt more like a slapdash couple together. They do a good job, but honestly it felt like a reunion of sorts from their last collaboration on the movie "Housesitter" back in '92.Aside from a few little chuckles here and there, it is just an okay remake. It's still very unnecessary. Except for the scene with John Cleese dressed in drag, dancing to the Donna Summer song "Bad Girl". That was funny!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake of a 1970 film by the same name, 'The Out-of-Towners', comes across as a time-pass fair, that offers some laughs in the goings-on. It has some moments, that work on it's advantage. 'The Out-of-Towners' Synopsis: The remake of the 1970 Neil Simon comedy follows the adventures of a couple, Henry and Nancy Clark, vexed by misfortune while in New York City for a job interview.'The Out-of-Towners' is not a hilarious/joyride of a film, but, has decent humor nonetheless. The journey the 2-protaganists go through, appeals in bits, especially in the second-hour, which is fast. However, the Writing Material could've been better, and even the humor could've been grander. Sam Weisman's Direction, is passable. Cinematography is ordinary. Performance-Wise: Steve Martin &amp; Goldie Hawn shines in lead-roles. Also, their on-screen chemistry, is good. John Cleese gets it right &amp; raises some genuine laughs. Others offer support. On the whole, A Decent Attempt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Out-of-Towners is one of the better comedies I have seen. With a stellar (but not Oscar-worthy) cast, the Out-of-Towners is a classic to me. Acting in terms of Martin and Hawn (they play a stressed-out, overdue married couple who's kids have been sent to college) is good, but not spectacular. Martin is talented, (as he shows here), but he cannot carry a film by himself, which is where John Cleese comes in. Cleese is a uptight, cross-dressing hotel manager with a presence that takes the movie to the next level. This is a movie that is helped by its directing and writing, as many of the funny moments (which are clever and well thought-out) should be credited to the writers more so than the stars. This and Bringing Down the House are the best Steve Martin films I have seen since Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's face it, the Out of Towners may have been an updated remake about an Ohio couple dealing with the troubles in New York City but I think the original was more believable and realistic. I didn't like the ending because that's not what I expected. The purpose of the original movie was about an Ohio couple who may not have been as off the wall as the Clarks. True, Mr. Clark played by Steve Martin and Mrs. Clark played by Goldie Hawn are truly comedic talents and who can bring this movie to life. Don't forget John Cleese (Silly for turning down a CBE)as the hotel manager! The film has a great cast, the writing was not upheld to the original quality of the first film which I think was just better and less silly than this film. New York City is a tough place to live, work, and even visit. The ending just disappointed me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cute and fun comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1999 remake of the 1970 Neil Simon wanna-be classic "The Out-of-Towners" is actually a more enjoyable and consistently funny movie. Pretty much the only thing I kinda liked about the original was its cruelty, as some one who lives in the NYC area theres nothing I hate more in the world than annoying tourists. However the original's cruelty got in the way of most of the comedy, this version doesnt have this problem. Also Martin and Hawn(2 great actors)are more believable than Lemmon and Dennis(neither of whom I mean to put down as wonderful actors)as naive and befuddled Ohio natives. Personally I could never picture Sandy Dennis outside of South Commack, LI. But anyway this version is just a nice(occasionally hilarious)fluffy piece of entertainment with John "I could be funny watching paint dry while gagged" Cleese added in for good measure. Just sit back, dont think too hard and laugh. Also notice that Martin and Hawn's daughter live's a few doors down from the best corned beef in town(at the 2nd ave deli of course).</fullReview>

Steve Martin gives his usual comic performance and Goldie Hawn does a good job of portraying Martin's wife. Her character could go hand in hand with that of Sandy Dennis' performance in the 1970 film. However, John Cleese stole the show (and possibly saved the film!) as the hotel manager, which he is used to playing (Fawlty Towers).

		<fullReview>One would think (as I did), that with Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn, and John Cleese, a movie should be, at the very least, decent. These stars (especially Martin and Cleese) have produced some of the funniest works of comedy of all time.Well, apparently I was grossly mistaken--this is single-handedly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It boggles my mind how one joke after the other can be so profoundly unfunny. It pained me to watch these talented actors execute one of the most positively lame scripts I have had the misfortune to come across. Based solely on the big names, I remained hopeful for a long time through the duration of the film, but it consistently failed to provide any entertainment whatsoever.Normally, both with movies and in life, I try to stay away from biased comments and broad generalizations. But with this film, it's hard not to let loose. I can count on one hand, perhaps even two or three fingers, major Hollywood productions that left me more bitter than this. This is easily one of the worst comedies ever made.I tried to enjoy this---I really did. But The Out-of-Towners ultimately fails miserably. If you really want time-efficient entertainment, just take your money and watch it swirl as you flush it down the toilet. Just please don't watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two funny scenes in a 90 minute movie just isn't enough. **1/2 out of ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can you recommend an entire comedy based on two funny moments? I fear not. But I am forced to argue with my self about it: This movie does have some laughs in it, compared to many other comedies that do not, but there just aren't enough. I am reminded of the old saying that if you enjoy a movie, tell your friends to go see it, no matter what the merit. And while i did enjoy most of this light-headed entertainment, there are so many things keeping me from recommending it.The story evolves from at least six different comedy classifications and probably more: the road movie, buddy, slapstick, sex-oriented, physical and the dumb and dumber type. The problem is, the characters are the only thing going for the movie, for the screenplay is dearly week and pale, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that, so it is up to the cast to bring in the humor. They do, to a certain extent, but their purpose in the plot is constantly changing. For instance, the Goldie Hawn character, during one of the movies "Dumb and Dumber" syndromes, is stupid on an airplane, smart in a hotel, witty during a selected joke, sly while scheming a blackmail plan and tender while looking at her spouses relationship with her. You have to keep the characters consistent, if not, all comic purpose is non-existent.This type of movie seldom works. Earlier this year we saw Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock doing the same sort of things in "Forces of Nature," last year's "The Odd Couple 2," also a Neil Simon remake. There are tricks filmmakers can use to make a successful movie like this, but they are hardly ever used.The film stars Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn as a middle aged couple who just experienced the cold move of their son, the husband lost his job, and the wife is having a mid-life crisis. Things are not going well, and they only get worse as they make an occupational tip to New York, but their train leaves them behind after their airplane is delayed.The characters go though lost of tragic events while they try to get to their destination, but when they do get there, all the problems are solved, because this is the kind of movie that would do anything no madder what to contain a charming and uplifting ending.The movie as a whole isn't all that funny. But the two selected laugh riots come from the sex oriented type humor. The first scene takes place in a sex-therapy session in which out of towners become mixed up in. The people there have many problems. One man masturbates seventeen times a day, another woman has sex with too many people, she is called the "Sexaholic." The other scene develops from the couple have sex in a dark, lifeless park, only for the mayor to light up the grand opening right in the middle of their doings.If you chose to see the movie, don't be surprised if you enjoy it. I liked some of the film, but not quite enough to recommend.</fullReview>

Another thing that is very unfair is people saying that Supporting Actor John Cleese was the only good thing in this movie... Which again I must say the he was not as up to par as Hawn or Martin were... Cleese was mainly only funny in one scene... and it's the obviouse one... the rest by him was way over-acted.Anyway, Hawn and Martin are great! Their Chemestry seems to always work... exspecially in 'House Sitter'..'The Out-of-Towners' Is hillarious... If you don't like It you must have forgotten what good humor Is... This movie is not only unfairly judged... but very under-rated, the harmless movies usually are, it seems.It's sad that mainly only naive people got to see this movie... stupidly comparing it to the other of the same name...If you have yet to see this movie... Please don't go on reading any of the other user comments on here... It will ruin the fun that you could have on your own of discovering that this movie is not as bad as it seems.

The original was sick, morbid and had the very annoying Dennis. This one is funny, not hilarious, but funny. It has a better cast (Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn are comedians--Lemmon and Dennis weren't), and has John Cleese who is hilarious as a snotty hotel manager--his dead pan delivery of all his lines really worked. Not a masterpiece but not the disaster I heard it was--for instance the previous Hawn-Martin movie "Housesitter" was much worse. This moves quickly, has an excellent music score and the stars are both in top form. Worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very irritating and frustratingly painful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Out-of-Towners, which is a remake of the 1970 comedy, was a very irritating and frustratingly painful movie to watch. It was not the least bit funny and a lot of the humour was very stale.Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn had the potential to make this work, however the whole movie was just a disaster from start to finish. Not even John Cleese could redeem this movie. Normally slapstick comedy is meant to be funny however I found myself frustrated at how painful it was as well as being very unfunny. I felt like I was ripped off.It was no surprise that this was actually a critical and commercial failure upon its release in 1999. Nonetheless this is a very forgettable comedy that I will never watch again. It robbed me of 90 minutes of my life that I will never get back.1/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For a remake it's quite a good one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One comedy that is so American that you may have problems sleeping afterwards because of the jaw pain you will get due to too much laughing. I would advise you to take some kind of Prozac before not to be too much overwhelmed by the silly situations this film develops with gusto and vicious pleasure. The poor people from Ohio do not have one gram or one 176th part of an ounce of luck when they come to New York for a job interview. The plane is out-routed, nearly out-sourced, their deluxe rental car has no air conditioning. They get lost because they don't know how to read a map, and then their rental GPS gets stuck in some kind of French sounding neighborhood and they end up in a fish-market or something like that with crates and fresh squishy things. 2,200 dollars for a 200 mile, at the most, ride. At the hotel they are kicked out because their credit card has been overdrawn by their own daughter. And that's only part of the beginning. Get to that film to discover the hundreds of details and risks out-of-towners run in New York City, an apple in which any smiling friendly face may be the worm that is eating the core of it. Very well done and so dynamic that you may fall for the good old days of Hair in Central Park.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why bother?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all know what's like when we have a bad day at the office, right? Well, this Neil Simon comedy looks at what it's like when you have the worst of all days just trying to get to the office. Sometimes, it's just not worth going, know what I mean? And, sometimes, it's just not worth doing something when it's already been done before, in 1970, with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis... and much better also.It's not that Steve Martin is a lousy comedian or wrong for the role as the harried and stressed advertising exec; quite to the contrary, on both counts. And, it's not that Goldie Hawn is equally inept either; her work has been consistently good, if not great, ever since I first saw her in TV's Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In of the 1960s.The problem with this movie is that it's not about the hapless couple at all: it's really about New York and why everybody should come to New York to live and love their lives away in married bliss ? sort of ? in the greatest city in the world. That's if you're a New Yorker...Look, the 1970 movie is still an excellent comedy that realistically explored all the things that can go wrong when you take a trip somewhere, and included most of the situations and sight gags that you can imagine about what can happen to you in a strange environment. This 1999 version unfortunately goes off into gratuitous tangents specifically for an audience these days that expects or wants to see excess. For example, not content with the star appeal of the main players, there is a cameo (relatively long also) from Rudy Giuliani, then mayor of New York, as we all know. What ? Giuliani bucking for President even then? Worse ? a walking talking advertisement for the kinder face of New York.And then we have John Cleese, reprising his role as Basil Fawlty ? but this time, as a prancing cross-dresser also ? once again browbeating hotel staff, sycophantically sucking up to rich customers and generally making himself look like the idiot he is, in this role. And, in the process, doing great damage to the memory of Fawlty Towers, arguably the best British comedy series, bar none...Why was this 1999 movie made? In the 1970s, New York was a dying city, in many ways. It was almost literally bankrupt. So, when made in 1970, that was the city you saw: grim, dark, moody, unsettling and not the place that the harassed couple finally chose for their new life together in the Big Smoke (as it was then, polluted and all). By 1999, things had gotten better: glitz was back, New York was thriving, it was the Big Apple, ready for you to bite into, if you had the moxie...So, naturally, the couple in this second coming find that moxie within themselves and finally join the fabulous fray to continue the American dream of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Hence, this movie is truly comic but not for reasons that the producers perhaps envisaged. As much as I like Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn in comedy, this movie is a travesty of the much better one made with the great Jack Lemmon. If you've seen the latter, then definitely don't bother with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually managed to see "The Out-of-Towners" in Mexico (and the subtitles were occasionally out of place). Knowing that it stars Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn as a couple having various unpleasant adventures in New York City, we can safely assume that it mainly exists to be silly. And it doesn't disappoint. Still, it's good to see that Martin and Hawn haven't lost their comic abilities after all these years. In my opinion, though, John Cleese was actually the best character in the movie.So, just accept this movie as nice, goofy fun, and you won't be disappointed.Bad girls. Hah!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always enjoyed Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn; however, after watching "The Out-Of-Towners," I'm not convinced that they work well as a comedic pair. In one of Martin's previous roles he had played a dramatic role in "The Spanish Prisoner," which seemed to fit him better than to play a comedic part in this film. The jokes in this movie were old and unoriginal. I can't deny that this film was all bad because I did enjoy bits and pieces of it. However, it seemed like it had been done before under the guise of a different movie title. It just did not have enough for me to keep my attention. It is a light hearted, but poor film remake that is unworthy of viewing by everyone. I am just happy I didn't spend money to see at the theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Typically I don't like movies where Murphy's Law rules supremely and EVERYTHING goes wrong... but, I like this one. Hawn and Martin's reactions alone make every chase, mugging, snubbing, and arrest worth it. As a laughable "Ohioan" myself, I can see why the main characters remain ever uncomfortable and ever out-of-place, which makes every joke where New York is the brunt doubly funny. This film also sends a useful message in the end. It teaches people not to give up, turn around, and head for home because of people "that don't want you", but to beat them at their own game."Only in New York". . . no, not really, but let them think that if it means winning in the end. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I personally think that my one line summary sums it all up, Oh dear indeed.This movie is based on the premise that the two "out of towners" have gone into town in order to get a new job and a new life style and in the middle of this are going to "rekindle their love" and in typical movie style it all goes bottoms up pretty quickly. In the story line it says that the Clarks are trying to rekindle their passion, but i personally believe that Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin should be trying to rekindle thier acting careers! I personally love Goldie Hawn and in the 1st wifes club is was fantastic and Steve Martin... Well, what can i say?This movie was something that you rent when there is NOTHING ELSE in the video store and decide to give it a whirl, and u feel cheated for the experience, it also gives credence to my belief that you shouldn't really watch previews about a movie before you see it, and this is because nearly ALL of the best parts in this movie were shown in the preview, and since the preview is around only 1 minute long that surely says something...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect example of repeatedly lousy movies on tv</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I picked up cable -- it's as lousy as I remember with the same B-movies you would expect, but with 355 channels now instead of 99. Out-of-Towers is one of the B-movies. Playing 459 times this month on all the Bad B-movie channels, Steve Martin plays a watered down Neal Page from "Planes, Trains and Automobiles," a much superior movie. Goldie Hawn plays a bimbo with smarts again, but one thing that was neat about her role is that they acknowledge her age and "over-the-hill" sex appeal that someone like Richard Gere still hasn't figured out. John Cleese reprises p****d-off hotel manager Basil Fawlty from the very funny BBC show "Falwty Towers" and gets a good amount of laughs, even if one is a cheap cross-dressing joke. Plus its great to see the Kids in Hall star Mark McKinny get slapped by one of his his mentors, Python's Cleese. Do some laundry, dishes, sort through your video collection like I did; it has some good moments. Not a great movie, but ok to watch maybe once. Average C-. 6.8 of of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fair remake of a really funny movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Out-of-Towners", the original version with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, is a very funny movie. I always liked it and loved that classic line "Oh My God!". I heard about this remake, and initially passed on it. It didn't interest me. Finally, a friend of mine who liked it bought it and we sat down and watched it. Throughout the movie, I kept referring to the original one. Eventually, this new "Out-of-Towners" became bland, mediocre, and sadly, not very funny.I don't see what's so funny about John Cleese dancing to music in drag. Also, Steve Martin was funnier in most other movies he has been in. Here, he's...ok. He'll made me smile, and that was about it with an occasional chuckle here and there. I absolutely hated Goldie Hawn's character. I understand that stupidity can be funny, but her character was so stupefyingly moronic, that she was despicable and unlikeable as a character. The screenwriters blamed all the mistakes and mishaps in the movie on her, and so when the couple reunites and forgives each other at the end of the film, we wonder why. This remake is not a bad film, and I didn't mind watching it. Still, it was mediocre, bland, and weak. It was a fair remake, although it shouldn't have been done. The old one was good, but to my understanding, it didn't gain a whole lot of popularity, so a remake of it would be even less popular. What makes this remake stall before takeoff? John Cleese and Goldie Hawn play characters you cant help but hate, and Steve Martin plays a character that we care even less about than we do about this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw previews of this movie I thought that it may be dumb, but it will at least be funny. Well I was wrong. Even though somewhere deep down the producers had an interesting message to convey about parents being left alone and re-evaluating their life, the way they tried to deliver that message was horrible. The first fifty times something silly happened to the couple was relatively funny. But by the end, I could almost predict what stupid mishap is going to happen next.Throughout the movie I like a total of maybe five lines of dialogue and everything else was at best mediocre, which is still more than I can say for the movie itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fish Out Of Water tale that flounders</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A perfunctory and sparingly funny tale of fish out of water and the enduring strength of friendship. Advertising executive Henry (Steve Martin) is in the midst of a career crisis, at the same time as his wife Nancy (Goldie Hawn) faces the loneliness of an empty nest. With their two children establishing independent lives, and the havoc that routine and familiarity can wreak on a 27-year marriage, our resident Ohioans head for New York City for Henry's job interview. Trying to find new directions in their lives, they end up getting lost in the big city. With little surprise and much less originality, our fish out of water are re-routed to Boston, lose their baggage, are mugged, starving, kicked out of their hotel, incarcerated ? and fall in love again. Except for a few minor giggles, Martin's usual flair for physical comedy and John Cleese's brilliantly sarcastic repartee, this is an unimaginative and wholly predictable movie that invested more in its production than in the script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ugly, but still a must see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I know that this is a walking contradiction of a movie, but it still should be seen by everybody. This is almost what not to do with a movie. I am not so callous as to say that I did not laugh, but I did not laugh much. I think that some parts dragged, and some other scenes were forced. When the movie was not totally focusing on their neuroses, or taming those down with others' neuroses, is when this movie shines. Otherwise, it should be thrown away. For instance, when Goldie Hawn, and Steve Martin lose it to the line of "Give me a break," it seems that they are even tired of it by then. However, they have real chemistry when they are surrounded by nymphomaniacs.Acting: Only John Cleese shines in every single one of his scenes, which are too few. Sure, it is a rehash of his Fawlty Towers character, and it seems totally Pythonesque, but he always makes it work. However, Hawn and Martin have never seemed worse than in this movie. They only click in a couple of scenes, and they only clash in a couple of others. The rest of the screen time together is exactly that, they see each other, but as friends, not as lovers, and so their tempers and emotions never quite go to extremes because they realize that they are just acting. Good actors become their roles, or at least seem like it. The only times that they really click is the scene after the mugging, and the scene with the nymphomaniacs. Otherwise, they are just blah. Tim Robbins had a nice cameo, and I think he was better than the main characters.Plot/Script: I came out of this movie feeling like I had seen this movie before, and it was very familiar. I have never seen the original, and never want to. They took bits and pieces from popular movies that people have laughed at, and tied them together with a flimsy, rehashed plot. "Planes Trains and Automobiles" seems to be the biggest influence in this movie. The writer never knew exactly what to have the characters say, and his slapstick was very inappropriate. In a comedy, one of these characteristics need to be present. He also thought that he should make the characters as dumb as possible. Getting mugged by Andrew Lloyd Webber, give me a break. I feel that the characters were very superficial, and stupid; but sometimes they were very scheming and quick. I think that Hollywood needs to make new movies, not adapt movies from novels, plays, or especially OTHER MOVIES. How blah and unoriginal.This is a movie that appeals to older folks, and is aimed at the lowest common denominator. However, the old folks feel insulted, and the LCD goes to see movies that are better like "Star Wars," "The Matrix," and "Go," all of which were much better than this movie. I have seen teens of the LCD buy tickets to this movie and see another. I have also seen teens skip buying tickets to this movie to sneak in to another, in case they are forced to watch this drivel. But, see this movie for what not to do, and for John Cleese. But, even he couldn't save this movie enough for recommendation----------4,</fullReview>

Perhaps the ones that didn't like it cannot relate to it. You have to be able to understand where the couple is coming from. Just like the tag line said "They fell in love 24 years ago... and in the next 24 hours, they'll remember why." It was a voyage or rediscovery of each other and humorous along the way in all the problems they encountered. I thought Hawn and Martin did a fabulous job in this movie and the ending was very appropriate. Now they are on another adventure together.

		<shortDescription>Stop Criticizing this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After spending a few minutes paging through all the reviews from IMDB users, I must say that we've all really forgotten how to enjoy movies. This movie may be a remake but it's intention was not to pay 'homage' to the original. It was simply another movie that wanted to entertain and make audiences laugh. Although it was not spectacular to every viewer, I don't think it is fair to criticize or compare it to the 1970's original without taking into consideration how the movie industry has changed since the 1970s. Furthermore, it is also not fair to praise John Cleese's perfomrance as a criticism to Martin's and Hawn's. As funny as he was, his job was relatively easy consisting of reviving his Faulty Tower's shtick and combining it with a few Pythonism's. Martin and Hawn didn't need to do anything spectacular to make this movie great nor are they 'hard-pressed' for good scripts. Afterall, it is all right for an actor or actress to enjoy doing a movie once in a while and I think with resumes as strong as theirs, Goldie and Steve have paid enough dues to get by on this one without having to bow down to the insufferable critics of this film who were so abhorred to have not laughed during it. For them I have but one comment; If you paid to be entertained and were only bored by this picture, then the joke is on you for not having a sense of humour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marc Lawrence has updated and adjusted Neil Simon's 1970 screenplay into a star vehicle for Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin. "The Out-of-Towners" originally played on the negative aspects of two midwesterners visiting an inhospitable New York City. Everything bad that could happen to them did. Lawrence has taken this couple and placed them in 1999 NYC. A series of mishaps work against Martin getting to a job interview which he needs because he has lost his former position unbeknownst to Hawn. This is also the couple's odyssey to redefine their love and marriage. Hawn and Martin are charming and play their parts to the hilt. The wonderful John Cleese is a gem as the manager of the hotel in which they are trying to register. If you've seen the coming attractions, most of the best lines and gags are there. However, you could do worse than spending an hour and a half with these three inspired clowns. It's too bad their material isn't a little better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It really hurt me to make it through this entire thing. I love me some Steve Martin and John Cleese, but this movie was down right offensive to me. I don't think I've ever said that about a movie before, but the way any sort of slightly-less-than-vanilla sex act is considered freakish and disgusting in this movie could only bring joy to Rick Santorum. The only people I could envision sitting in a theater laughing at this is a group of WASP-y middle age white people who go to the movies once a year on Christmas and the rest of the year watching Nora Ephron films on VHS. I've had people talk to me recently about how maddeningly bad the new Indiana Jones film is and how they have to explain how bad it is, and that's how I felt about this movie. Stay away from it if you value your soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steve Martin is a Lemon, Not Jack Lemmon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who is a fan of the original movie will be disappointed by the effort (or lack there of) by Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn in this 1999 remake. The 1970 movie starring, Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, is a classic. Lemmon should have at least been considered for a Academy Award for his performance. Steve Martin is a lemon, not Jack Lemmon, in this newer version. Goldie Hawn certainly is not golden. They both over act and over react in almost every scene. The key to being effective in a comedy is to deliver funny lines in a serious manner, and trust the script. Not make it so evident to the viewing audience that "this is where you laugh now." Watch both movies, starting with the 1970 original. When you compare the 1999 version with the classic, you'll drive away with the 1970 model. "The Out of Towners" is out of sync.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>awful remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always enjoyed Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn; however, after watching "The Out-Of-Towners," I'm not convinced that they work well as a comedic pair. In one of Martin's previous roles he had played a dramatic role in "The Spanish Prisoner," which seemed to fit him better than to play a comedic part in this film. The jokes in this movie were old and unoriginal. I can't deny that this film was all bad because I did enjoy bits and pieces of it. However, it seemed like it had been done before under the guise of a different movie title. It just did not have enough for me to keep my attention. It is a light hearted, but poor film remake that is unworthy of viewing by everyone. I am just happy I didn't spend money to see at the theatres.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martin gives a good Martin here. His performance is always special, especially with Goldie Hawn in the mix. This is a great film, lots of fun, and loads better than the original. Goldie put forth her best effort and you can definitely tell. Her classic beauty and style was more than evident. This is perhaps one of her better portrayals. Not her best, but towards the top. It was John Cleese who stole the show. This is a totally outrageously fun role to find him in. I loved his performance in this movie. He was hilarious, funny, witty, and endearing. This is not a fantastic movie. No one will nominate this production for much of anything. But it is a fun movie. I enjoyed it immensely, and it's far better than the 1970 original.It rates a 6.2/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost totally without merit....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often had to get up to make a drink to avoid the most cliched moments. The oasis of entertainment sustained at the kettle became more frequent. But bladders are only 'so' big. The toilet therefore became another haunt during this movie - relief of a kind. But even tiled floors pall after a while, so we switched the movie off.Why do intelligent, talented people bother to expend the effort making films like this ? They must have enough money by now - so why not just walk off the set and do something more worthwhile?Was there anything here that wasn't a)cliched, predictable, b)done before - better (30 years ago)?Really - don't bother to watch this one. See Roxanne again and remember that Steve Martin was once a very funny man indeed.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>out-of-towners shouldve stayed home</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martin and Hawn's son leaves for college, rendering their lives meaningless. Martin heads to NYC for a job interview and is soon surprised by Hawn on the plane. It's the beginning of a laughless journey as the two get lost in the wrong town with zero dollars. The only way for the film to work, of course, is for everything to go wrong and stay wrong. But unlike Martins' terrific, similarly themed "Planes, Trains, and Automobiles," when something goes bad here, its not funny! Ala PTA, he gets stuck next to someone annoying on the plane. Instead of the late, great John Candy, its Hawn, with her whining and "are you glad I came?" nonsense over and over (this is one of her more unbearable performances). Then at the rental car place, again ala PTA, they only have one car left, at which point Martin makes the unfunny remark, "You know honey, they should change their sign to 'We have car.'," then the two add a pretentious giggle. The only scene where I sort of smiled was when the two get stuck at a sexaholics meeting, but all else fails. Even Cleese's dance scene seemed a desperate attempt at a much needed laugh. 1992's "Housesitter" featuring the two stars here was no masterpiece, but at least had some remotely humorous chaos going on. This is just empty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Result of a Cheap Studio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure this Neil Simon play is very funny on stage, but despite some very talented actors and performances, the studio obviously didn't want to spend the money on a talented, proven director on what they thought was sure-fire: Neil Simon and Steve Martin. This lack of common movie-making sense makes for a painfully unfunny movie.There is only one funny moment, at the very end, and this works solely because it's Steve Martin. Even John Cleese's colorful character falls flat-- the momentum of the film around him doesn't sustain his presence.Yawn. 3 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If one is going to do a remake of a wonderful old comedy, you would think that one would be sure that one had a good shot at equalling or surpassing it. This weary effort falls flat, despite Steve Martin's and Goldie Hawn's noble efforts to breathe some yuks into the lifeless script. Half the trouble comes from turning this from a comedy into one of the half-comedy/half-sob-story flicks we see so often nowadays (Grumpy Old Men, Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles, Once Around, &amp;c &amp;c) which invariably fall flat in both departments. Laughs are few and far between, the best one being reserved for Rudy Giuliani's double-take at discovering Martin &amp; Hawn in flagrante on Central Parks' lawn. The travesty is the ending, which completely inverts Neil Simon's whole point in the original. Avoid this dog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake which outshines than the original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the new version of "The Out-of-Towners," I rewatched the original the next day, and am of the firm opinion that the Steve Martin-Goldie Hawn version is not only one of the funniest movies this year, but an improvement over the original.Here's why: The Jack Lemmon-Sandy Dennis version suffered from poor pacing; a lot of screen time was wasted watching them walk in the rain, for example. The new version moves much more quickly and contains funnier gags. It's also a plus that the couple's children are grown and figure into the plot, replacing the quite young children (unseen) in the original.Another problem with the original was the discontinuity of the characters. The couple (the Kellermans in the first outing; they're now the Clarks) was supposedly from Ohio, but Jack Lemmon's character carried the same attitude ("Your lawyers are going to hear from my lawyers about this.") as any number of Neil Simon's native New Yorkers. Sandy Dennis also spoke in a tone of voice and accent which suggested Brooklyn, not Columbus. She also had misplaced concerns ("What about the milk for the children?") more appropriate in a local with time on her hands than a visitor in a run for her life.Finally, one glaring plot hole from the original has been fixed. In the 1970 version, the Lemmon character is interviewing for a job in the Manhattan office of the firm he now works for, and it is established that he has been there before. It is a mystery why he simply didn't call someone from the office when he got in trouble. In the new version, this same character is out of work and interviewing with a firm whose members are unknown to him.Although both films are quite good -- the 1970 version is a notable icon of the helplessness and frustration people felt with the world at the time -- the 1999 version stands as the better production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shouldn't Have Been Remade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three heavyweight comedic actors (Goldy Hawn, Steve Martin, and John Cleese) star together in a film scripted by Neil Simon. If not a winner, at least a tolerable movie, right? Wrong. Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin are preachy and whiny in their lead roles. John Cleese is better, but has very little screen time. And he too has done much better. Outdated, unfunny, and pedantic are the words that come to mind in describing this sad remake. They shouldn't have bothered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Out-Of-Towners s a nice little comedy. Perhaps it isnt a film Id watch in the cinema but in any case its a good movie. Goldie &amp; Steve are great together and so is John Cleese. This film also takes place in New York (a big plus!). The only problem is that most of the jokes are only mildly funny or just amusing. Some scenes are hilarious though.Check this one on video. It gets 6 out of 10 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well , after watching this movie again on DVD(which puts VHS videotapes to shame), I 'll give my review of this movie without any spoilers. The "Out of Towners" is a remake of a classic movie from the 1970's.Paramount did the first movie , so they asked Neill Simon to do a update of this movie. The basic premise a husband and wife go to New York for a job interview . They encouter many people and situations. During all their misadventures, they discover what they are missing in their married lifes. Also in this movie you can see John Clees, as a hotel manger with a strange secret. Mark McKinney(Superstar) also appears in this movie, even though it's only one part it 's still a fun movie. The movie is PG-13 for sexual references, and bad word once in a while . It 's also 90 minutes so it will go by fast!!!also we can see Central park and New York City for those of us , who wish we could travel the world but we do it though movies!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pale imitation of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although many critics have slammed the original version of this movie, which starred Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis as the harried visitors to New York who are poster children for Murphy's Law, I found it to be hilarious, as I happen to be a fan/subscriber of Murphy's Law. This remake, however, is in no way to be confused with the original. Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn show glimmers of enthusiasm throughout the movie, but never quite work themselves into a lather about the perils befalling them, which was a central device of the original. For those viewers seeking a reason to watch this movie, there is but one--John Cleese in the role of the hotel manager. It brought to mind his performances from old episodes of "Fawlty Towers"--he is hilarious and is indeed the shining star in this otherwise drab affair. A curious note for those viewers who also saw the original--a central theme of the original was Lemmon's intention to sue everybody and anybody who caused him trouble during his New York visit. I find it interesting that, in today's litigation-happy climate, there was not one threat of legal action in the new film. Odd.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn once again waste their talents in this remake of a 1971 comedy, in which Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis once again wasted their talents. At least Lemmon and Dennis were believable as the couple from an Ohio Suburb. Martin and Hawn come off way to sophisticated to be so easily befuddled by The Big Apple.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The new remake of the 1970 Neil Simon classic THE OUT OF TOWNERS stars Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese. However, even with this excellent comedic cast, the script for this film itself just staggers with unfunny jokes, scenes, and humor-much UNlike the first. If you're a fan of the original, maybe you want to see this to compare it yourself to the first. However, then again maybe you should just leave the first film by itself, and not see this. It's your choice, but beware-it's just not funny like the original-1.5/5 stars--JOHN ULMER</fullReview>
