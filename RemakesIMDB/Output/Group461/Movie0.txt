		<shortDescription>All the remakes and imitators are just swimming in its wake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the recent box-office success achieved by the latest remake of 1974's `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,' it's worth looking back at Tobe Hooper's original horror classic. The movie tells a fairly simple tale at heart. A group of five teenagers driving through rural Texas happen upon a deranged, cannibalistic family. Psychological terror and chainsaws ensue. Yet despite this simplicity, what is it about `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' that continues to succeed so with its audience? Outside of one memorial scene involving a meet hook; the movie is not particularly gory by today's standards. The film's characters and actual scares are not that remarkable. The power of `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' lies in its atmosphere and in what H.P. Lovecraft called `the oldest and strongest kind of fear': the fear of the unknown. The later of these two staples of great horror is often cast aside in modern horror movies-especially in those churned out by the great Hollywood engine. Instead, every mystery must be explained away, every mask ultimately pulled from a monster's face, and not a moment of exposition is spared. It is interesting to note that the filmmakers behind the latest `Chainsaw' film chose to implement all three of these stylistic vices in their remake. In the original, the feeling of dread and mounting paranoia creeps over the viewer in slow but steady waves. The first scene in the film depicts a desecrated grave with a voiceover of radio newscast, immediately followed by an opening credits sequence set against a backdrop of roaring solar flares. This, along with some idle astrological chatter on the part of one of the teenagers early on, leads to a feeling of cosmic disarray in the lonely Texas hills they traverse. Questions about the villain's mask or the field of cars under camouflage netting are left for the viewer to answer on his or her own. At worst, in the loss of any acceptable answer, they are forced to ponder that terrible and limitless gulf of the imagination: the unknown. In it's later stages, the film becomes a cacophonous world of throat-peeling screaming, blood-shot eyes, laughter, and grinding machinery. One is forced to recall the solar flares in the film's opening credits. In the climax of famous dinner scene, there is a feeling of cosmic forces pressing in on reality and warping it into some crude mockery of order, as if the world were but a TV or radio signal distorted into madness by flares on the surface of the sun.  In the 29 years since `The Texas chainsaw Massacre' hit theaters, there have been countless imitators and four additional films in the franchise, three of them remakes. Yet as loved and influential as the original classic has been, many who would seek to emulate its vision seem to overlook its true strengths.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE masterclass in low-budget horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre can, and will, be reinterpreted by critics and theorists for decades to come. It was shot in the summer of 1973, during the aftermath of the Vietnam War and the Munich Olympics massacre, at the height of the Watergate scandal and the legal investigation into the shootings at Kent State. It was an era of plane hijackings, government oppression and dishonesty, racial conflict, terrorism and revolution. As a mirror of a dark period in American history, Chain Saw remains one of the best evocations yet of the era, as a group of young individuals, returning to the nostalgic home of their childhood, stumble into the raw and irrational cruelty of the modern world.The movie has a weak, though functional storyline, one that has since became the staple for slasher movies; a group of teenagers get lost, stumble across evil and get stalked and killed. But Chain Saw isn't about storyline and plot; it's about creating an experience, a sensory overload. The cast and crew work tirelessly to create scenes and images that are raw and powerful and ultimately, against all expectations, beautiful. Leatherface's travesty of motherly domesticity as he prepares dinner, his child-like dance in the dawn light, the open door at the gas station, the van making it's slow turn off the road towards the derelict and ivy clad Hardesty residence are all images that burn themselves into your consciousness after just a single viewing.The cinematography is exceptional. Watching the Special Edition, you'd never know that this was shot on 16mm in poor light. The picture quality is outstanding, the colors rich and vibrant, the blacks inky and menacing. The brilliant azure skies, the jade green of the grass, the bright red generator, the searing sunlight and stifling shadows. Every frame seems saturated in nicotine gold. Beautiful.Though not always likable, the actors are always believable. Performances are universally startling, but special mention has to go to Marilyn Burns. Though she has little more to work with than the clichéd screaming heroine, she works it with remarkable conviction. It was a traumatic shoot, and it shows. Few actresses have so effectively conveyed mind-numbing terror.The soundtrack is exceptional and deserves more recognition. It is a great testimony to the experimentation and risk taking attitude of the era that all melody is destroyed under an industrial ambient soundscape of metallic clangs, scrapes and screams, evoking the atmosphere of the local slaughterhouse and the Family's state of mind. Terrifying.Despite the complete lack of gore or extreme physical violence, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre continues to horrify and holds up the countless, shot-on-video, slasher clones of subsequent years for the puerile crap that they truly are. Whether by accident or design, this one is a classic.9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indisbutably a classic of cinema, and not just horror cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those who have posted here comparing Tobe Hooper's (one and only) masterpiece with the dreadful remake are presumably young children with no real understanding of cinema. The 1974 film is the antithesis of the slick, MTV-influenced, cynical cash-in mentality that informed the later remake. The fact that the remake's target teen audience (well, at least some of them) appeared to lap it up is just a sad reflection of how far standards have fallen since the heyday of the horror film in the 70's. But Hooper's CHAINSAW is more than just a classic horror film. With its print in the permanent collection at the NY Museum of Modern Art, it truly is a classic of cinema. I've shown this to Bergman fans, Tarkovsky fans and, yes, horror fans too - none of them have been prepared for its power, its inventiveness, its willingness to push the envelope of what cinema can do. And, with its simple story and powerhouse, unstoppable delivery, it is as open to interpretation as any piece of "modern art" - whether it be from the "vegetarian treatise" angle, or the post-Vietnam traumatised America school of thought. But, as I was on my first (of several) viewings, those I have introduced to this movie have been bowled over by the quality of the film-making, and the filmic techniques (soundtrack, editing, startling images) used by Hooper to capture his "waking nightmare" on screen. It is something I really don't think any other film has quite achieved, though many have tried.Now, of course, there is a fluke element at work here. Hooper never came close to achieving anything like this again, and many, though not all, of the film's fascinating resonances are a product of the era and the filmmaker's unconscious sensibilities. What he obviously had as a director was the kind of daring to take the visceral power that cinema can deliver so well to the limit, to the the edge of acceptability, skirting on exploitation. That the film is so unrelentingly dark and so unbelievably sadistic in its second half, and yet fascinates even as it traumatises, is a definite testimony to the skill of its director. What could have been sleaze is instead a horrible nightmare experience, sure enough, but one that borders on the transcendental. Should be seen by ALL students of cinema at least once in their lifetime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The single best and scariest horror film EVER!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of teenagers on a road trip... OH BOY!!! HERE WE GO AGAIN... the typical horror movie set up. But wait.... something sets this one apart... IT'S SCARY... to be more precise, IT'S TERRIFYING!!! And I'm not just talking about the horrible 70's clothing and hairstyles. This film is one of the very few films I consider scary. Let me list a few reasons:1) The gritty documentary feel the film has.2) The excellent performances by Edwin Neil (the Hitch-Hiker), Jim Seidow (The Old Man), and Gunnar Hansen (Leatherface) as the psychos (in a film this low budget and grainy, performances this real feel all the more scary) and Marilyn Burns (Sally) and Paul A. Partain (Franklin) as the victims (we truly believe and feel their fear).3)The atmosphere (the skeleton bone art... the freaky metal door in the farmhouse... Leatherface's mask and demeanor... even the way the sun sets in this film is spooky along with the sound of the farmhouse generator).4)Relentless Horror (Leatherface RUNS not speedwalks after his victims with a live chainsaw... there's no time to trip and fall or your booty is chainsaw bait)5)The ability the film has to scare you with almost a complete lack of gore (the only "gory" scene is when Leatherface accidently cuts his thigh with the chainsaw). The scares lie within the performances and atmosphere and pacing.In closing... this is truly the greatest horror film (and one of the greatest films period) ever made. 15 out of 10!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure, uncompromised horror! A modern classic which still confronts, disturbs and terrifies audiences worldwide.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tobe Hopper's 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' is a landmark low budget horror movie which must be considered a modern classic. Hooper's subsequent career has ben extremely uneven, and frequently disappointing, but even if he never made another movie he would still be a legendary figure. As would Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) and his twisted family played by Edwin Neal and Jim Siedow, and immortal scream queen Marilyn Burns. These actors never have to set in front of a camera again, they'll never be forgotten by horror buffs worldwide! In this day and age of cynically conceived and marketed MTV-friendly teen slashers it's a revelation to see old school horror classics like this, Romero's 'Night Of The Living Dead' and Craven's 'Last House On The Left'. Uncompromising movies, pure horror that makes no attempt to water themselves down and court a mainstream audience. This movie was one of the most controversial of the 1970s, censored or banned here in Australia, and in Britain, and despite the hundreds of horror movies released since, it is still powerful and fresh. There is an undercurrent of bizarre black humour underneath the film, a lot subtler than the sequel and other more obvious "horror comedies". The terror isn't compromised, the uneasy giggles make the extreme images even more difficult to dismiss. The cast, all unknowns at the time, and from what we know know paid diddley squat, are all pretty good, especially Marilyn Burns (who Hooper used in his underrated 'Eaten Alive' and who also appeared in the Charles Manson TV biopic 'Helter Skelter'), and whiny paraplegic Paul A. Partain (who went on to bit parts in 70s Drive-In faves 'Race With The Devil' and 'Rolling Thunder' and very little else). One would have thought both would have went on to bigger things watching their performances in this movie but sadly it wasn't meant to be. Gunnar Hansen is absolutely extraordinary as Leatherface. An amazing performance with his features obscured and no real dialogue to speak of. I don't think it's an exaggeration to compare it to Boris Karloff in the original 'Frankenstein'. Leatherface is a horror icon, and 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' is a landmark movie that remains essential viewing for every horror buff. It's a sensational movie that still has the power to confront, disturb and terrify audiences worldwide!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scariest movie I've seen in a long time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to get this movie for my annual Hallowe'en scarefest, a week early...as the new one was out in theatres, I felt a need to see the original first, and bow am I glad I did...The whole movie just blew me away, I turned off all the phones, chat programs and so on, and just let the story hit me. I think what is still with me after this is the sense of fear and utter WEIRDNESS that emanates from the movie...And it all seemed so realistic...no hokey fountains of blood, no running into the shower, or overused cliches, just a bunch of kids that need to get some gas, meet some very odd characters (The Hitchhiker is superb) and then fall into the wrong place at the wrong time...I think Hooper must have had some divine inspiration, because each of Leatherface's scenes is exquisitely planned and executed, from the first guy who gets dragged down, to Pam, to the encounter with Franklin and Sally in the woods (how chilling and scary was that, and yet how clever, to chase someone in the woods equipped with...a chainsaw) to the end.Very, very unsettling as well, from the beginning to the final dinner scene, to the unforgettable whirling dance by Leatherface at the end.Simply put, the best horror movie ever...if this doesn't scare you, then nothing will, sadly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Texas Chain Saw Massacre, this movie is a legend in the horror genre. I have heard so much about this movie, the interesting thing is, my mom told me it's one of the bloodiest movies she's ever seen, then she paused and said "Wait, actually there wasn't that much blood? it's just creepy". So I had to see this movie, was it really that scary? Is it really that bloody? Is it really that creepy? I had to see for myself, so of course I bought the movie, it was on sale, watched it during the day, not much effect, was pretty disappointed. But then my friends came over and we wanted to watch a scary movie and they all saw that I had The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, we turned off the lights, turned on the surround sound and then the screams came as I realized this is one messed up movie! Sally Hardesty and her wheelchair-bound brother Franklin travel with three friends to a cemetery where the Hardestys' grandfather is buried to investigate reports of vandalism and corpse defilement. Afterward, they decide to visit an old Hardesty family homestead, and on the way, the group picks up a hitchhiker. The man speaks and acts bizarrely, and then slashes himself and Franklin with a straight razor before being forced from the group's van. Franklin tells Kirk and Pam about a local swimming hole, and the couple heads off to find it. Instead, they stumble upon a nearby house. Kirk decides to ask the residents for some gas, while Pam waits on the front steps. Receiving no answer but finding the door unlocked, Kirk enters the house and is immediately murdered by Leatherface. Pam enters soon after to find the house filled with furniture made from human bones. She attempts to flee but is caught by Leatherface and impaled on a meat hook. At sunset, Sally's boyfriend Jerry heads out to look for the others. Finding the couple's blanket outside the neighboring house, he investigates and finds Pam still alive inside a freezer. Before he can react, Leatherface appears and kills him, stuffing Pam back inside the freezer afterward. With darkness setting, Sally and Franklin set out to find their friends. As they near the killer's house, calling for the others, Leatherface lunges out of the darkness and murders Franklin with a chainsaw. She is captured and invited to Leatherface's house for a family dinner she'll never forget.Movies from the 1970's are so special to me, the reason why I think some of the greatest horror movies came out of that decade is due to the fact that directors didn't hold back like today. Most directors of today's Hollywood are too scared of the censors or go too far and make the audience gag rather than scream. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre I'm sure Tobe Hooper wasn't exactly expecting this movie to become the classic it has. Leatherface is frightening and I'm not so sure I'd accept an invitation from him and his family for dinner. I think they made the Manson family look like the Cleavers, you haven't seen a horror film until you've seen The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The one... the only... The Texas Chainsaw Massacre!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me begin by saying that there are precious few movies that can actually scare the crap out of you, and this is one of them. The tension that this movie generates is overwhelming at times, and if you watch it with someone who's never seen it before, be sure to keep your eye on them. You'll probably notice a look of disbelief on their unsuspecting face.Anyone who doesn't like being scared will end up being unable to finish this movie. People who have a taste for the brutally bizarre will probably hit play again after the credits roll. In light of all this, I must also say that in some respects, TCM's bark is much worse than it's bite. Being banned in so many countries for so long, and having a title that includes the phrase 'Chainsaw Massacre', has seemingly led many people to believe that there is an undue amount of gore in it. However, there simply isn't. Gore is not where the scares are in this one. The scares come from the absolutely brutal and bizarre scenarios that befall poor Sally Hardesty.In closing, I'd also like to go out on a limb and make the following grandiose statement: TCM is the greatest horror film of all time! Not bad for Tobe Hoopers' first effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The (original) Texas Chainsaw Massacre, is without a doubt in my mind, the most impressive horror film to date. No other horror film stays with you in the same way. You feel not only fearful for the characters, but at times feel afraid for your own safety. The natural lighting and loose, improvised acting style creates a strong sense of reality that no other horror film can possibly achieve. Under a thin layer of dated aesthetics (1973 style of dress) lies the most dangerous, horrifying and psychotic world ever committed to script or screen. As the first of its kind, this movie set the mold for the modern horror film, though none were ever to realize any comparable distinction. It gave birth to the "slasher" genre (for better or for worse) . It is also one of few timeless films that has managed to combine horror and avant-garde styles, successfully. Unlike its remake, this one is more of an exercise in minimalism and simplicity (think even Dogme). The expert subtlety of the filmmakers; Tobe Hooper (writer/director), Kim Henkel (co-writer) and Daniel Pearl (cinematographer) results more inpsychological terror than in gore. The air-tight script, jarring realism and attention to detail are unparalleled in practically any film, horror or otherwise. And last, but by far not the least Marylin Burns PHENOMENAL performance is the only in cinematic history (a close second by that of Shelly Duvall in The Shining) that evokes such a nature of desperate and primal fear. You truly believe in every single one of her screams that her life is hanging by a single, thin thread.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic simply put</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie set the stage for the onslaught of classic modern horror of the late 70's and early 80's. Tobe Hooper's vision paints a drab and disturbing picture of a family of cannibals who hunt their victims using any means necessary for survival. Caught up in this whole mess is a group of young people, unaware of what lurks down an old back road of Texas. Hunger is our most probable urge as human beings, and this family takes this idea to the extreme. Each family member is their own character with their own feelings and their own personalities. One such character, Leatherface, stands out for the fact that he was born without a face, thus using human skin to gain an identity. This is what sets him apart from other slashers such as Michael Myers and Jason Vorhees for they hid behind masks. It's safe to say he's not the only insane one in this bunch. Every one of them are one fry short of a happy meal and I am sure they like it that way. Gunnar Hansen did a great job of playing Leatherface, sculpting a faceless killer who slew not for fun but for survival. His perfect killer image was later destroyed by other actors in later sequels. Many people refuse to watch this movie in the first place because of what they've heard and because of the title. Strangely, some even walked out of the theaters on the previews for this thing. That's just how strong this movie actually is. There's really a lot less gore in this movie than most people think. It's Tobe Hooper's great directing that pelts the viewer with suspense. The last 10 minutes of this film are some of the most exciting, terrify shots ever put on film. All because of Leatherface, many people's nightmares will be dominated by the hum of a chainsaw.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of sensory horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who knows out of what strange game of fate or as if the universe conspired upon its creation and everything that came to pass did so that Tobe Hooper would make The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Like a blood spattered, low-budget Orson Welles of 70's exploitation, the immensity of his debut will forever haunt him and his career.The task of committing TCM to words is a difficult one, not because the proper words don't exist but merely because they can only describe the surface and never convey the essence and the heart and what can only be felt in one's own skin and maybe that of others. Sounds of animals and howling of beasts and the clanking of rustling metal speak TCM's language. The dissonant chord that sounds in the soundtrack as the movie fades from black to flashes of decaying flesh is TCM's lingo and what defines it is disorientation.Indeed the first shot proper that opens the movie, that of a rotten head and as the camera zooms out we see the whole dead body in a grotuesque posture like some sort of zombified jester sitting atop a gravestone, offers no clue and safe grip for the viewer. After the opening credits roll, we are served an orange sun burning in a blackened sky and that dissolves into the image of a dead armadillo laying on the street. We're 5 minutes into the movie and we're provided no clues of typical genre orientation, no protagonists of any sort. As the eye scans the image for something to cling to, narrative or otherwise, there's nothing there save for decay and death.And then TCM starts rolling and picks up steam and never stops. Apart from how original or not the concept is (crazed backwoods family terrorizing city kids) it's the approach that makes all the difference. Hooper achieves sensory terror and doom by piling on images and sounds, each of them spilling to the next frame starting an avalanche of horror. A close shot of cattles as the van drives in the background, a seedy gas station, a crazed hitch-hiker the kids pick up, an abandoned house. In the interior shots of the abandoned house the blacks are crushed and we only see silhouettes moving against the textures in the walls and those are juxtaposed with exterior shots where the whites wash out, like some kind of rural hell, a land of some other order that is coming apart under the weight of its own abandonment.Even when the sensory chaos is broken for a while so that our genre expectations can be fulfilled as the crippled guy Franklin mutters to a couple that leaves the abandoned house to make out "Yeah, see you in an hour or so" (followed by a drone in the score) and we just know he's never gonna see them again, a typically ominous foreshadowing common in slashers, that only lasts for seconds. Then Hooper cuts back to puzzling images, feathers on the ground and some kind of dreamcatcher made of bone (?) and weird buzzing sounds in the score, like otherwordly insects flying unseen. TCM constantly tips its own axis, content to be left out of balance.The first encounter with notorious chainsaw-wielding Leatherface is as disorienting as anything that comes before it. He appears out of nowhere like a beast in a frenzy and the carnage begins. And for a movie of TCM's reputation there is surprisingly no (or at least little) explicit gore. Yet the violence is startling and raw as the images that preceed its outburst spill into it and add their own touch of the morbid. Eisenstein must have been clairvoyant when he spoke of how powerful montage can be.We're also given glimpses to Leatherface's tortured, crazed soul, bits of characterization like a gesture and a look of his eyes. Not a psycho killer out of sadistic pleasure perhaps, he looks more like a savage beast defending its territory or a wild dog scared of intruders trespassing in his nest.Like an avalanche of macabre images that is impossible to stop once it starts, TCM whizzes by in a manic pace. The chase scene where Leatherface hunts down Marilyn Burns, scared out of her wits and howling like a wounded animal, is shot through branches of trees, as if the landscape is conspiring to ensnare the victim and so hunter and hunted run in the fields and inside a house and then back outside while the titular chainsaw is buzzing away in a constant reminder of gruesome death. Even when Hooper overplays his hand (as in the dinner scene) it's all done with deliberation that cannot be ignored, like maybe the director is as insane as the characters he's depicting and he takes great pleasure in basking in their insanity.TCM simply has to be experienced, no critical analysis can do it justice. Without bucketloads of gore, without the slick look of high budget, it remains one of the most bleak, atmospheric and aurally violent movies of all time. What happened to Tobe Hooper's career after it is anyone's guess, but TCM is good enough to top entire filmographies of other directors. It has been imitated countless times, remade and given sequels and prequels to, but there's something primeval about the original that can't be recaptured.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I needed a drink after this one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hooper certainly went for a real bargain when he felt the need to express himself on this one! I was excited to view this one years ago, after hearing much praise. They all could not have been more right, but so underspoken. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING can prepare you for this one. It was made for the real shocks, and delivers em. With the famous gore that enters through out the film, the scares are the most genuine, as they happen slowly at the opening, and then boom at you in the last real. Tobe Hooper has definitely made the ultimate horror classic when this one was made. His opening will always give me the nightmarish feel when that camera sound goes off, exposing the skeleton.TOTALLY CREEPY! Next, the rural setting, outstanding, with eerie sounds. In the middle of nowhere, and something, or someone is watching! AHHH! This little film about five college kids going through the norm, to an all of a sudden train ride to hell! Once Burns is captured by the "family", the insanity starts and continues to the end!!! The tied-to-the-dead body thing, the grampa-pound-the - head thing! I was going crazy trying to stay sane while the ending was concluding! OUCH! This one calls for a drink afterwards! Seriously! An instant classic!

		<shortDescription>What REAL art-house horror should be like.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Indie film community's head is so far up it's own ass with delusions of grandeur that they actually fail to see, at times, the area where their own films succeed. And is it any wonder? When Tobe Hooper's 1974 opus was released, it quickly became a mainstream hit. I specifically remember it becoming 'The film to sneak into' for kids. This automatically robbed it of any following it had with indie film fans despite being one of their own circuit's films. They instead dismissed it as a pointless exercise in graphic gore(there's actually very little), while praising lousy later films like 'Blair Witch' to the skies because of so-called deeper meanings. A shame they could not see that Hooper had crafted perhaps the ultimate statement on post '60's America, and one that remains unmatched in it's power.The film makes no doubt about what state the country was in: Decay. Everything in the film reeks of death. From the prologue with the corpse 'art'(not as much a stretch considering the kind of art produced in this era), the Dead Armadillo in the film's opening; a Texas national landmark, it would seem, to the dried up 'Ol swimming hole, to the heroine's once-thriving home now populated with spiders and rats. It doesn't take sides, either. The 'Good 'ol ways' represented by the homicidal Sawyer clan as a nightmare parody of the American bible-belt family are obviously the villains, but the 'new' generation, itself dying out since '68, isn't presented as any more desirable. Both are mercilessly ridiculed. Even the heroine survives only by sheer luck. She's not the intelligent, feminist heroine(despite being of the 'free love'generation)that Laurie Strode of 'Halloween' is, she survives because of the killer's(s) incompetence. It's almost as if the film is saying that the ignorant, rebellious youth have emerged scarred from the real world they ran off unprepared for(The doomed protagonists are all jaded ex-hippies), and are all limping back home(Sally does visit her old house as a form of shelter)to the comforting arms of the 'old folks' who warned them; who react violently and vehemently, telling them 'I told you so!', but still give them relief: Death.Speaking of the 'heroes', isn't it bizarre how the heroine's crippled brother Franklyn is treated like a nuisance by them? Even though we don't see it; it's obvious that they have frequently ridiculed him(His reaction in the abandoned house to their laughter best reveals this, as he can't stand to hear their mocking laughter even if it is not directed at him and he knows it). Yet, in contrast to the lead's treatment of the childish invalid Franklyn, the Sawyer family treats the two characters most similar to Franklyn(mentally and physically); Leatherface and Grandpa; as valued kinfolk, they are accommodated and appreciated in their family unit. Although the older brother heaps much verbal abuse on the Hitchhiker &amp; Leatherface, it is no more than your usual stereotypically portrayed hick family on 'Hee-Haw'. They're close-knit, and as Franklyn says after the Hitchhiker slits himself and endures it: 'Gotta admire that".Add to the fact that Franklyn is the the only character in the film to come close to communicating with, and in a sense, relating to, one of the Sawyers(Who starts up a genial, at first, conversation about knives and killing with the Hitchhiker); and it becomes more disturbing. Almost as if, under different circumstances, Franklyn would occupy the same position as Leatherface(If he could walk)or Grandpa if he were a member of the Sawyer clan, as if the hitchhiker recognizes this. It's also strange considering this take, that Franklyn is the last of the leads to die. I'm not saying Leatherface spared him for last out of mercy(He had just met Franklyn when he kills him), but because they are similar symbolically. Even Hooper has called Leatherface a 'big baby', and that seems to apply to Franklyn as well.Bizarre, the cannibals accept the handicapped(in their own way), and the 'heroes' see the handicapped as a burden, much like how former hippies who were drafted and returned maimed or crippled were rejected by their former friends for 'killin' babies' in 'Nam. Even more strange is that it's Franklyn who inadvertently causes their deaths when he gives them the faulty directions to the swimming hole, as if he's unknowingly getting his revenge.Obviously, I see the film as a social commentary. But I would not simply call it another entry in the cycle of other post '60's downbeat dramas, but a hybrid of that mentality with the 'Old Dark House' genre of years past. Compare the film with Whale's 1932 film of the same name; you'll see what I mean. Even that film's macabre humor and invalid patriarch character are referenced. TCM is an update on that genre with post '60's cynicism. As that stands, it may not be the first slasher film, as it's often called, but the last, and best 'Old Dark House with a homicidal but oddly funny family' type of film ever made.~</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of grim horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" could be one of the finest examples of horror film-making, maybe even film-making in general. It does not have much plot, but instead exists solely to put the viewer in a state of distress. I remember watching this for the first time and how utterly freaked out I was.Despite being a grueling experience, the movie really does not have much explicit violence. Some of the murders happen just out of the camera's frame; only once do we actually see a chainsaw penetrate flesh, and it happens to be one of the villains. What earns the film its grisly reputation is the unrelentingly grim tone, and by playing this to the maximum, Tobe Hooper manages to make you think you are seeing something that you are not.Hooper starts the film off at a relatively slow pace with a small group of young people on a road trip in a hot van, and it slowly builds in intensity as one by one they fall victim to a family of psychotic degenerate cannibals inhabiting a rural house that they are unfortunate enough to be in the vicinity of. Some people might expect the most unsettling aspect of the movie to be the violence, but what I found even more upsetting is the way the deaths of the characters come suddenly and unexpectedly (to them, anyway). It went beyond most slasher films, especially the first two deaths, a couple called Kirk and Pam. Happening upon the dreaded house almost by accident, first Kirk goes inside and is immediately murdered with a sledgehammer to the head. Then Pam begins to get suspicious when he doesn't return. The camera finds her sitting on a swing outside, completely unaware that her boyfriend is already dead inside the farmhouse. When she goes into the house looking for him, she is seized, screaming, by the bizarre "Leatherface", who hangs her on a meat hook through her back. In agony and shock, she is forced to watch Leatherface dismember Kirk's corpse with a chainsaw, all at once aware that Kirk is dead and that she herself is certainly doomed, when just ten minutes beforehand, they were outside looking for a swimming hole. Later, another character goes looking for them and happens upon the house as well, finding Pam inside a locked freezer. The most horrifying thing is that she is not dead yet, sitting upright in shock but then hopelessly shoved back inside by Leatherface, who has now killed her would-be rescuer.These nihilistic scenes signaled an abrupt shift for the film, which up until this point had been a little boring. The sudden plunge into savagery was like a trap springing on the viewer, and the effect was extremely memorable. The remainder of the film dealt with the plight of the final victim, Sally, who endures what has to be one of the most grueling experiences a horror-movie heroine ever had to face.Grotesque and fever-pitched once it gets going, "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" was quite a shock for viewers in 1974. In this sense it was a lot like "Psycho"; before it, there wasn't much to compare it to. Rather, it set the stage for numerous films that came after, and it may not resonate with younger audiences who are more accustomed to the films that have been made since.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Cutting Edge' horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 11 years old. I'd given an older kid 50p to borrow his copy of Texas Chain Saw Massacre. I took it home and put it in the top-loader. It took me a fair while to press down on that chunky silver 'play' button, recollecting the stories I'd heard about the film. Rumours were flying around the school - the filmmakers had gone mad whilst making the film and killed each other - Leatherface was real - it was a documentary and the killings are all real. Chain Saw was a snuff movie. So, I pressed down the hefty button and braced myself for what was to come, eyes peeled, resisting the need to look away as if I were looking at a traffic accident. When the film was over I felt disturbed. I hadn't witnessed real human killings, I hadn't just seen a snuff movie, but Chain Saw had reached deep down inside of me and planted a seed of unease, I felt cold to my very core but I didn't know why. As the years passed my recollections of the film became more and more distorted. Most notably my memories of the killings within the film - bloody, gore-filled scenes. Blood. Lots of blood.The reason I have rambled on about these events is that, until re-watching the film, I appeared to share the same memories as those that had seen it around the same time as me. This is a testament to Chain Saw's masterful construction, a film powered by the age-old technique of suggestion. There is hardly a drop of blood shown within the film, yet people will remember it in bucket-loads. In fact, director Tobe Hooper only shows us what is necessary, maybe because of the low budget he was working with (Hooper's later output would suggest this), but it forced creativity from the filmmaker that is sadly lacking in his other work (Poltergeist may be an exception, but Hooper's direction was steered by Spielberg on that one).Okay, the story: A mini-bus carrying five teenagers drives through Texas. Pre-emptively they drive past a slaughterhouse as cows await their death. The tone, and their fate, is set, and it is only a matter of time before the teenagers will become meat to a local cannibal family. Their ordeal begins when they enter a sinister old house (don't they always?) and start to snoop around. Before you know it one of the teens, who you're expecting to be the lead, is struck over the head with a mallet by Leatherface (Gunar Hansen), an obese retard with a skin mask. As he falls to the floor, his body twitching, Leatherface closes a sliding metal door and finishes the job where we cannot see it. From here on in it's basically a matter of picking off teens one by one with the use of the mallet, a meat hook and, of course, the chain saw.What is essentially a by-the-numbers plot is raised above par by the style and atmosphere of the film. From bizarre shots of solar flares to the hot, sun soaked imagery of Texas, Chain Saw seems to be sweating horror out of every pore. The locations are macabre beyond belief, in particular a room with hanging animal bones and bone constructed furniture, and the whole film has a hot, musty orange glow about it that almost makes you smell the dead human meat in the cannibal house.The performances are relatively functionary from the cast, although Marilyn Burns puts in a good turn as the tortured 'final girl', making us feel that her life is truly at risk. Even though all she does is scream and plead for her life, she does so with such energy and realism that it is difficult to watch her. Most disturbing of all is a scene where the grandfather of the family, a man so old he can barely move, is given a hammer to deliver a deathblow to her head. The family holds her over a bucket as the old man raises the hammer to strike her, but he is barely able to hold it, let alone hit her with it.Chain Saw is full of images that will horrify and disturb, but unlike many other films that do the same, Chain Saw will leave you breathless with its unrelenting assault on the senses; from the images on display to the ear-shattering sound design that allows Leatherface's saw to intrude your living room and slice at your nerves. Texas Chain Saw Massacre is one of those few horror films that will unnerve you to a degree of unrest because it hits home where it hurts. Its savage, raw power and its total lack of reason give the impression you are watching something you shouldn't be. A bit like the traffic accident I mentioned earlier. In fact, you never really have time to think about what you are seeing until after the film has ended, which leaves an indelible image of a skin-masked madman waving a chain saw around his head in anger.So, if you watched Chain Saw a good few years ago and remember it being a standard slasher flick with lots of gore, revisit it and see just how effective suggestion can be. If you've never seen it - what are you waiting for? This is low-budget film-making at its best and a lot can be gained from repeat viewings. If you can watch it more than once that is?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I seem to be swimming in another direction from many of my friends. I really liked this, and incidentally both `Blair Witch' projects. They incorporated neat ideas about film (regardless of whether they were consciously intended) which worked.In this case the idea is straight out of Godard. The most effective films are those in which live is `real,' where the dramatic shaping and emphases are non-existent. Or if they exist, they are discovered within life.Horror films are very much dramatized. Every element of the logic that drives the story, every event, everything we see is done so that the camera can know what is happening. These people don't exist in a 360degree universe, only in a 15 degree one so that we can see them. There isn't spontaneous, overlapping conversation, but carefully parceled, clear dialog so that we can understand. Your typical horror film spins a logic that taps our inner superstitions; then it displays the fantastic results of that superstitious fear for us to experience. The art in the ordinary tingler is in stretching out and clarifying the horror. We must _see_ it, every detail, or imagine it via standard dramatic devices as it happens off stage.So what I liked about this is that the events did not bend to the camera. The first death was a bonk on the head, and 2 seconds later, we're on to the next event. No voyeurism because as if by bad luck the camera wasn't in a good spot to gouge into the details. It just happened. (We don't even see what happened to the girl on the hook. Imagine that occurring in your typical Jason epic.)And so do all the others, until that scene with the old man and the hammer that falls out of his hand. Now _that_ was dramatically sculpted, was unreal, had our surrogate eye right where it belonged. And that's why it was so effective.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspired brilliance!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So much has been written about THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE these days that it seems almost redundant to write a review about it. Needless to say, TCM is one of my top films of all time. It's so good on so many levels that it would take a book to write a perfect review of this once-maligned flick. Some people, who have never seen it before, wonder what's so great about it after watching it for the first time, well, this is probably because TCM is the most copied movie of all time and TCM will look too familiar to newbies. You can literally trace x number of horror movies (or even action movies) back to this film. The thing is, TCM is a groundbreaking movie but few people back then noticed it. Mainly because when this low budget movie was originally released by its unscrupulous distributors it was dismissed as another trashy drive-in horror movie, when in fact few realized the brilliance to be found within it. After TCM was released, few horror films could afford to go back to Hammer style horror or the usual boring fare. You can really see the difference in movies made before TCM and those made after TCM became a big hit. The unrelentingly blunt, chaotic, savage, take-no-prisoners attitude of TCM was unlike anything anyone had ever seen before and this aspect of TCM is what makes it truly groundbreaking. Horror movies or even movies in general simply couldn't be cutesy or quaint anymore.The film is unsettling and funny. It's totally original with its brazen, full-throttled approach to horror when most films made in those days were static, slow and poky. The level of energy this movie has is truly amazing. For a low budget flick, the camera is stunningly fluid and rarely static. The editing is sharp. The music is ominous but never overwhelming. The look of the film is perfect; it's looks so natural and un-Hollywood like which adds a lot in creating the uneasy atmosphere of the movie. But the direction by Tobe Hooper is inspired brilliance and even though Hooper often injected bits of black humor here and there which could have made the film less authentic, the humor never overtakes the story (which is probably what many didn't like about the sequel, which, btw, I recommend too) because the rawness of what's occurs on screen is never pulled back. The direction is perfect for this gruesome horror story. What's really remarkable about TCM is that there isn't a "weakest link" about it. Even though the budget was almost next to nothing and the conditions of making the movie were, according to many articles, hellish, the film doesn't have one weak element. Everything fits perfectly. Technically, the film is amazing. There isn't a scene that feels excessive or some performance that wasn't good. Everything is top notch.TCM is filled with classic moments: the beginning, with the flashes of the corpses; the scene at the cemetery; the hitchhiker in the van; Kirk facing Leatherface; Pam and the swing shot; Pam falling in a room filled with bones and feathers; Pam and the hook scene; Leatherface surprised by Jerry; Sally being chased by Leatherface (the scene is only screams and chainsaws, for a whole 6 minutes. Amazing!); Sally being poked by Drayton; Sally at the diner table (yikes!); Grandpa and the hammer; Sally being chased by the hitchhiker and Leatherface during the chaotic "live-wired" ending; a crazed Sally in the pick-up truck. The film is one amazing moment after another, from beginning to end.The actors are mostly unknowns to us today but that doesn't mean their acting wasn't good. The entire cast is excellent and game, ready to give their all. What I really like about the script is that everyone comes across as real. Some characters are even unappealing, like Franklin, the guy in the wheelchair, which you won't see done in movies these days. Today, everyone has to be cute, fun and likable, but in an edgy kind of way. Franklin is a real pain in the ass but having him in the movie makes the film feel more realistic. As for Marilyn Burns, well, she's probably the most underrated "scream queen" in history of film. While other actresses have made a career out of horror films and eventually moved on to other genres, Marilyn has been unlucky in this aspect. You'd think her career would have taken off after TCM but it didn't. The release of the TCM early in the 1970s is probably one reason why her star never shone like Jamie Lee Curtis. The "fans boys" that followed Jamie Lee's films were too young when TCM was released. As for the actors who played the Sawyer family, well, there isn't enough praise in the world for them. Jim Siedow is totally unforgettable. The same for Gunnar as Leatherface. But the greatest performance in TCM is surely given by Edwin Neal, the hitchhiker. Man, oh man, what a performance. His performance is so unbelievably believable that I wonder: was he even acting?Another great thing about THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE is how it captures the feel and attitude of its time. It's a great time capsule. It's so in the moment, that watching it is like traveling back in time and being there in 1973 or 1974. And remember, this was a very troubled time. Vietnam. The Manson Massacre. Richard Speck. Nixon, etc. TCM is a true statement of the time it was made.But the thing that always gives me the creeps when I watch TCM is the scene at the beginning, when they drive by the cattle ranch and we see the poor animals while Franklin talks about how they are killed and everything. This gives the whole movie its queasy, black humor subtext: the folly of mass consumerism. The general public doesn't see how animals are killed in slaughterhouses. Our meats are always packaged neatly and look appealing. But we never see the real horror behind the benign act of buying some ground beef at a store. The story of TCM is sorta like what happens to the cattle but instead we see cannibals processing their food which, obviously, comes from humans. Hooper seemed to be using the whole horror story as a statement about mass consumerism gone horribly wrong. Sally running away from the Sawyer house is like the cow that got away from the slaughterhouse.All in all, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE is so good that it's one of those rare gems that can be truly appreciated as a straight horror movie, as a black comedy and even as an art film. Personally, I think the film gets better and better with time. There hasn't been anything done like it since. The whole movie was the result of catching lightning in a jar. It's a one of kind film experience that can never be duplicated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For Halloween this year (2015) I watched The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (TCM) and The Evil Dead in the theater.I'm a big fan of the "Evil Dead" movies and I heard good things about this film. I went in knowing almost nothing about the film.This film deserves its position at the very top of the horror genre. I was totally entranced and creeped out, this was truly a scary movie. And as I believe Hitchcock stated, you can often terrorize an audience by showing less. This film isn't actually that violent or gory, but the film does an excellent job not showing you things and allowing your mind's imagination to run wild. It's all about pacing and setup here. The very first brutal act is actually barely shown and over in a split second but there is a huge impact.Everything in the film was done so well, from the sinister interiors of the brothers' home, their bizarre family rituals, the look of rural Texas. Compared to modern films, it has a wonderful organic quality.The film, shot on 16MM, looks simply stunning. The level of grittiness is perfect for this type of film.The story starts off slow, but the "Hitchhiker" (a wonderful performance that steals the show) gets it going and once we're introduced to Leatherface things really heat up.People were hollering and screaming in the theater. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a few words, first: raw, sick, filthy, shocking, and perverse to the core.The original TCM is an unparalleled achievement and a priceless contribution for the classic, gory horror cult genre. This movie is all about revisiting torture, in many forms, over and over again.Make no mistakes. This is one of those movies that you either have to say you love or hate. There is no way of standing in the middle. "Normal" people will probably tend to reject and ostracize it, making use of the argument that it has no plot, no fundament, no substance. That this is just free violence for the sake of shock and controversy. Trend freaks will probably tend to say they loved it just because nowadays it seems hip and fun and fashionable to appreciate explicit gore and violence and torture through movies, especially in the so called classic ones. These too have no idea what this movie is about. Most likely, a great number of them hasn't even seen it yet. Intelectuals or pseudo-intelectuals will probably tend to regard it as a low budget groundbreaking, avant-garde movie, although deep down inside, it's unlikely that there is any part in them capable of feeling something other than disgust by its essence.I could go on for hours.Then, there are others, whose irrational morbid fascination for the ORIGINAL Texas Chainsaw Massacre lacks a proper explanation. Better yet, lacks a need to be explained. Those people relate to the movie simply because its true core appeals to them, and despite the fact that most of them will actually try to verbalize an explanation, I feel there is no need for it. Some people are just more connected to some things than others. Watch American Psycho, watch the scene where he is exercizing, and look at the movie playing in the background. It's just something you feel. Not something you think.And for me, this movie is perfect in every way."I was just standing in Montgomery Ward's, in front of an upright display of chainsaws, thinking of a way to get through the crowd. And the focus just racked from my eyeball to the people to the saws, and the idea popped." Tobe HooperI guess, deep down inside, it all comes down to which thoughts pop into your mind, when you're standing on a crowded store cue waiting for your turn to pay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A group of youngsters stumble across a psycho family who carries out a brutal and homicidal slaughter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Classic Terror Hooper film in low budget and lots of violence and gore . An idyllic journey in southern Texas driving a van by a group of young people becomes a nightmare when they pick up a young man . A disgrace is committed and ignoring all the warnings they are looking for a shelter in remote farmland . Later, they wind up in the nightmare clutches of a psychopathic family who kill and eat passing travellers ; finally are relentlessly pursued by maniac Leatherface wielding a chainsaw. As the youngsters are dispatched unceremoniously and mercilessly . This noisy as well as visceral film contains images of graphic violence and may not be suitable for all audiences , viewer discretion is advised. The movie contains a pernicious as well as strong stuff . It packs grisly horror, tension, mayhem, horrible gore and lots of blood and guts. Washed-out as well as granulated cinematography and the camera often assumes a pointedly aggressive stance . Screeching and eerie musical score by means of strange and offbeat sounds . The creepy screenplay by Tobe Hooper and short production proceed a bestial and savage picture plenty of chainsaws , meat-hooks and many other things . The motion picture was well directed by Tobe Hooper.The film is based on real events about the secluded farmhouse of Plainfield (Wisconsin)handyman Ed Gein ,( Leatherface character) who admitted today he disembowelled and butchered the body of old widow, authorities found the decapitated boy hanging in Gein's woodshed, gutted out and strung up by the heels. Investigators have also discovered the head and face of 54 years old woman. Portions of the bodies of ten or more people had also been found among the body parts, human skulls, furniture made of human skill, box full of noses, skin from a human head, a belt made of female nipples, one small skull believed to be that of a six-year-old child. Authorities suspected cannibalism. The Ed Gein grisly killings made horrendously startling to people. The Geins lived a fairly good distance away from Plainfield little town. When we look at Gein's life , we just have this sense of incredible isolation from any human contact, except with his crazy mother. He grew up in a household with an alcoholic and abusive father and a mother who was very domineering. She was a fanatic and did not let Ed or his brother to have much to do with the outside world, because there were sinners out there.The mother denied them any meaningful relationship with the outside world and particularly with women . So Gein grew up with this very powerful ambivalence towards his mother and he developed this resentment and hatred . Gein was looked at as the nerdy kid that his contemporaries would poke fun at, which also tended to confirm for him a lot of his mother's paranoia. Gein's house really was a symbolic representation of what was going on his head. He kept many dentures and human bodies around.Firsly, he started robbing graves. Gein said that he had begun to do this a few years after his mother's death. He almost seemed to take a glee in creating novel artifacts out dead bodies, and various human handiwork .He would make bells made out of nipples and used human shinbones to prop up a coffee table, plus took the tops of skulls and inverted them and used them four soup bowls and upholstered a chair in human skin. Like the film, he cut the faces of corpses and used them as masks and flayed the top of the torso of one of his victims and also created some leggings. After he began to sew together these parts of skin from various corpses, events correctly reflected on this creepy movie.It's followed by various sequels such as ¨The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2¨ (1986) by Tobe Hooper with Dennis Hopper , Caroline Williams , Bill Moseley,¨Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III¨ (1990) by Jeff Burr with Kate Hodge , Ken Foree , Viggo Mortensen , Tom Everett ; ¨The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre¨(1994) by Kim Henkel with Renée Zellweger ,Matthew McConaughey , Robert Jacks as Leatherface . It is also followed by a remake (2003) produced by Joel Silver and directed by Marcus Nispel -with screenplay and production by Tobe Hooper , also author of original script- Jessica Biel,Eric Balfour,Jonathan Tucker,Mike Vogel,Erica Leerhsen and a prequel titled ¨The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning¨ (2006) by Jonathan Liebesman with Jordana Brewster , Taylor Handley , Diora Baird , Matt Bomer and R. Lee Ermey . And finally ¨Texas Chainsaw 3D¨(2013) by John Luessenhop with Alexandra Daddario , Dan Yeager as Leatherface , Trey Songz , Scott Eastwood and Richard Rhiele .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Five teenagers embark on a road trip through rural Texas in search of their grandfather's grave. On the way they pick up a sadistic hitchhiker who ominously smears blood on the side of their van. Undeterred, the group keeps on driving, descending deeper into the backwoods of a forgotten Texas town. Eventually the van runs low on gas, and the group decides to stop and get some help from the locals. They stumble upon an old farmhouse with a generator and decide to investigate. Instead of finding gas, they discover a family of cannibals, including a psychotic son wielding a chain saw and a mask made of skin. Each one of the teenagers are killed and butchered by Leatherface as their curiosity gets the best of them. The one remaining survivor, Sally, is kidnapped by Leatherface and his family, who are intent having her for dinner.This film doesn't leave your mind upon leaving the theatre. It stays in you, swirling around in your stomach, creating a mix of nausea and disbelief about what you just witnessed. As I was walking out, I heard people saying "that wasn't even scary," and I thought to myself, 'did we just watch the same movie?' They weren't scared because they didn't absorb it; they didn't let it penetrate their psyche. They wanted a slasher film, and what they got instead was an unsettling portrait of a family so depraved and malevolent that it felt like they could actually exist somewhere. That's what is so terrifying about this movie. It explores the horrors of what could be. It exploits the unexplained fear we have of towns that are stuck in time and cut off from the rest of society. How are these people expected to evolve socially when they are removed from all civility? There is certainly a sociological subtext to Massacre.There is some compelling camera work in this film. The low-angle shots add to the tension of what lies ahead, and also helps to portray a sort of gritty sexuality. There is a particular shot of Pam walking up to the farmhouse that emphasizes her posterior qualities, and as we take in the shot we are still very afraid for her. This juxtaposition of sexuality and horror is a powerful combination that invokes two of our strongest emotional responses simultaneously. This balance falls in line with genre conventions of 70's era horror. The grainy quality of the film gives it a dirty realism that hasn't been matched in a horror film since; it immerses you into the filth and decay of the old Texas town. Tobe Hooper's extreme close-ups of Sally's eyes and teeth make you understand her terror in the most personal way. The atmosphere of this movie is visceral and confrontational; it exploits the human mind's tendency to amplify fear in one's own consciousness? What exactly is behind the mask? How many victims have been mutilated by this family? We construct our own terrifying conclusions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Horror Movies of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where do I begin with this gem? I think it's truly scary because it has the possibility to be real, unlike, say, supernatural happenings. The movie starts out with the characters, my favorite being Franklin. I love his accent. This movie was filmed in Texas, and growing up in San Antonio and visiting everywhere around the state, I am in Texas when I see this movie. I have seen farmhouses and weeds and flowers just like the ones in the movie- I have even heard the same drone of summer insects- you can practically feel the heat!-- so I can say it is authentic. :) There is a wonderful view inside an old abandoned farmhouse when the kids first stop. It appears to be a real abandoned house, not a prop. One of the girls mentions she stayed there when she was 8 years old, and talks about her fascination with the zebras on the wallpaper, which is now a dirty grey and peeling off. Franklin mentions in the van his family working in the slaughterhouse, while the girls take a more vegetarian attitude. It's what makes this movie all the more entertaining. All the characters are believable, and likable, except for the bad ones, of course. After they pick up that really weird hitch hiker dude things get weirder and weirder, and they get killed off one by one in very horrible fashion. It's hard to watch, the actors and actresses were flawless. The film is very dated, but this is only because of the clothes and vehicles. Thirty years on, it's now deliciously retro, and has become the stuff of legend. It's just one of those movies that everyone has seen, or at the very least heard about. I have seen all of the sequels and the new remake, and this one is still my favorite. It is the original idea, in all it's boldness. So bold it was banned in several countries for being too graphic. It is very graphic, disturbing, which is why it's such a great movie. Defineately recommended.</fullReview>

Forget the pathetic 2003 remake, the 1974 original is infinitely superior.The disturbing subject matter exemplified by the title of the film is the main reason behind the controversy surrounding the film, particularly in the UK, where it was banned upon release in 1974. Those who have not seen the film would be surprised to hear that it has hardly any blood at all and no explicit violence is shown. More surprisingly, the chainsaw mentioned in the title is only used to kill one person. Virtually all violence in the film is implied (although in a way that makes the scenes look realistic and provoke genuine shock), which is the way that all horror films should be made. Some of the most disturbing scenes of violence ever committed to film are shown in THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE, the best ones being the scene where Pam is hung on the meat-hook and the scene where Franklin is killed with the chainsaw whilst being pushed along in his wheelchair through dark woods by his sister Sally.The film uses an unbelievable level of suspense, shocks, creepy background music and psychological horror to resulting in an atmosphere of genuine fear and uneasiness that leaves a lasting impact on its viewers. Hooper repeated some of these techniques in SALEM'S LOT and POLTERGEIST, although in the latter case it was only to a very limited extent. And Hooper's masterpiece was also the inspiration behind other great works such as HALLOWEEN, which use similar methods to convey a sense of fear, shock and general uneasiness.Most horror films at the time used the age-old techniques of suggestion and psychological horror to create an impact that will remain on the viewer for the rest of his or her life, the best being PEEPING TOM and REPULSION. But, Tobe Hooper came along and took this to a new level with THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE.The documentary style of the film creates a sense of grittiness and realism, and the introduction at the beginning claiming that the film is inspired by actual events serves to reinforce these effects.The acting in the film is top notch, particularly from Marilyn Burns as Sally Hardesty and Gunnar Hansen as Leatherface. Marilyn Burns does an excellent job at portraying Sally as the innocent helpless victim, whilst Gunnar Hansen makes Leatherface a truly menacing character that will go down in history as one of the most scariest ever shown on film. Sadly, these excellent performances did little to open doors for these stars to display their fine talents in other masterpieces of this or any other genre.Some of the camera angles used in the film are simply superb, most particularly in the scene where Leatherface appears out of nowhere in the woods with his chainsaw raised ready to kill Franklin. Absolutely no explicit violence or gore is shown because the camera is directly behind Franklin, covering what would normally be shown in a standard slasher film. Yet, I found this scene not only to be the most shocking in the whole film but the most shocking I have ever seen in any horror film. Sadly, Hooper's masterstroke has rarely been used in any other film of the genre. Other excellent camera angles used include a continual focus on bones and other similar symbols of death or mutilation in order to create an atmosphere of fear and uneasiness.The soundtrack in the film can only be described as exceptional. As pointed out by another reviewer, the film makes use of metallic clangs, high-pitched scrapes and screams to compliment the superb photography. This is entirely unique as most horror films normally rely on suspenseful music in order to create the necessary suspense.The innocence of the plot line, which involves a group of young people on a holiday trip, sets the standard for the slasher films that were inspired by THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE and makes the horror ahead even more shocking. Many seemingly red-herring-style diversions from the innocent plot line are used early on in the film, particularly where the hitchhiker is picked up, that set the tone for the rest of the film and contributes to the fast-paced shocker that the film represents.My only complaint about the film is the prolonged "dinner scene" where Sally is being beaten over the head with a hammer. I believe that the act of physical torture used in this part of the scene does not have the same impact as the mental torture used in the earlier part. Further to this, I believe that the film would perhaps have had more impact if there had been less emphasis on the physical torture aspects and slightly more emphasis on the mental torture aspects.Some suggest that Hooper's masterpiece was down to a pure fluke. But, if one looks very carefully at his other works, he or she will find other similar masterpieces, including SALEM'S LOT and TOOLBOX MURDERS.Unlike most forgettable slasher films that were made, particularly the straight-to-video types of the 1980s, THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE has a purpose and a place in history. A place in history among other masterpieces such as HALLOWEEN, PEEPING TOM and REPULSION, that will be preserved forever.Overall, my rating for THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE is an unconditional 10 out of 10.If only horror films could be made like THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE today, I would make the effort of going to the cinema to see them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film just shows that you don't need to put millions upon millions into state-of-the-art graphics and special effects to make a sensational picture. You see, I would give this film 9.5/10 any day, and it's a shame it's only down as 7.2. Now thats a crime. Audiences just have too much on a plate today! Films are never as shocking, or as involving as they ever used to! The Chainsaw Massacre was made on an ultra-low budget in 1974, but continues to shock and horrify the world 32 years on, and is still banned in some countries! Cinema has never been this controversial or shocking and I URGE you to see this, even if you are a part time fan of the Horror genre. The Shock Factorwill always live on. Longer than Leatherface's 'Grandfather'. Brilliant. *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a chilling, horrific piece of Americana. This movie is not as gory as it was once rumored to be upon its birth in 1974, but it's psychologically brutal. Some say this movie is trash and vile, disgusting nonsense, but most will agree this is a seminal film that was part of the 1970's horror film revolution. This film took me into another world when I first saw it. I was a horror fanatic who had seen many more contemporary horror films before I saw this for the first time. When I saw it in its totality, I was in awe?it held me to the edge of my seat. The chase through the woods by Leatherface is one of my cinematic memories for keeping me wide eyed and fixated solely on the screen?I actually got tense?and I don't get tense. This a raw film-making brilliance, Tobe Hopers seminal horror work that was a part of the 1970's horror revolution that was being waged by horror greats George Romero, David Cronenberg, Wes Craven (somewhat), and John Carpenter.I saw another post that said this film has no meaning or message, it's tasteless was the sum of their review, I however disagree with all my heart.This is a movie that puts a mirror to the post-Vietnam era and challenges the status of our society in terms of its social and family values. This is a twisted and cannibalistic family that is led into madness because of the loss of the American values as a result of the technological revolution. They used to run the slaughter house and now they have been replaced by machines. In their loss of fulfillment they turn to murder and cannibalism in order to fill their void; this is obviously an allegorical statement by Hooper regarding the loss of jobs and substance at this particular point in American history. It also is a film that stresses the deconstruction of the family. This films theme seems to resonate in similar form to a Sam Peckinpah film, that being the loss of the great frontier and American spirit. This is a family that has gone insane because of a loss of tradition. The youths disposed of in this film represent those victims that are caught in the after blast of this condition. If Peckinpah were to do a horror, this might have been it.This is not a true story by the way, this was just one of the many films to lie about a non-fiction incident. It is, however, one of the many films to be influenced by the legendary serial killer Ed Gein. A killer who took the skin off his victims and made wigs from them, he also made furniture, art and jewelry with their body parts. Gein was also the influence for Psycho. Hoper said it was also influenced by a story he was told as a child. This is a highly recommended film for any true horror film fan. It's more psychological than gory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent horror movie that works on several levels. Much better on DVD than it was on videotape</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I originally saw The Texas Chain Saw Massacre 3 or 4 years ago on VHS. At the time, I thought it was played primarily for laughs -- that is as a spoof on horror movies.I just watched the DVD and I have a whole new perspective on the movie. Due to the increased clarity of both video and sound, I found the movie to be much more frightening, although just as graphic as it was when I saw it before. I now see it as a truly great horror film with a sense of humor, rather than a spoof.I had intended to rent this movie again for the past few months, before the new The Texas Chain Saw Massacre came out, and I am so glad I was able to get the DVD this time.The remastered DVD --especially the soundtrack-- was so good that I will probably buy a copy for myself.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well..when I first sat down to watch this movie I was expecting a 'comedy-funny-splatter-slasher-b movie' in the likes of Halloween, Evil Dead, Friday the 13th etc.Fortunately,I was totally mistaken... This is the first(and maybe last)movie that invites you to join in there,be a part of the movie,feel the intensity,be a part of the massacre.Words are meaningless here,but at least I can try making some comments on this masterpiece.First of all,it's a movie made on the 80's(i.e. 1974), and that means that it was made before Halloween, The Exorcist, Silence of the Lambs and most of the 'known' horror-thrillers out there.Tobe Hopper's originality is majestic!The guy really introduces some really original ideas here:the chainsaw(as a weapon), the raw and merciless murders, the sick introduction of the 'family' and their house(chicken feathers and bones decorating the house),the family portrait(sick brothers and 'Grandpa'),the creepy paranoid music sounds,the moody and freaky atmosphere and the way they murder their victims-plain and simple..just as that..nothing more-nothing less.No special cgi-effects-everything here is original and true as hell!The killers here are really hunters..you will not see any of the victims trying to hurt-or attack the killer(in comparison to all these Halloween and Friday the 13th crap-where the killer is slashed-hacked-drowned-electrified...BUT STILL ALIVE!)No..no...forget about that..the victims just run for their lives.. Make a favor to yourself and WATCH this movie..Recommended to quality fans who see gore as a form of art and not as meaningless-funny horror movies.THIS IS CULT !!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raw Violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the fact that this movie made a fortune and has received all kinds of popular acclaim, I dare say that this movie really isn't that good--especially when compared to similar movies made afterward. Having said that, it is this very fact that makes "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" so special. After all, without this particular movie one wonders if movies like "Halloween" or "Friday the 13th" would have ever been created. Likewise, it is equally fair to ask if there would have been bogeymen like "Michael Myers" or "Jason Voorhes" without "Leatherface". I doubt it. Now, although this specific movie wasn't the first "slasher film" ever produced it certainly did its share toward setting the foundation for the sub-genre that so many horror fans have come to know and love. Part of the reason for this is that viewers during this particular time-period weren't accustomed to seeing so much raw violence on the movie screen. And that's pretty much all that this movie has to offer as there is little character development, suspense or even gore for that matter. Additionally, the acting and the script were all pretty basic as well. But give the devil his due, the director (Tobe Hooper) used quite a bit of imagination and what few resources he had he used to the maximum extent. And that's quite commendable considering that these days so many directors with a limited budget lack the talent to produce anything other than something "so bad it's good". At least this movie was an honest effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An awful plot and terrible acting. Most of the film appears to be of a girl screaming while being chased by a man swinging a chainsaw around his head like a safari-park chimp.Perhaps it could be argued that this film led the way for many teen slasher flicks that followed, however, most teen slasher films aren't actually all that good. (Considerably better than this tripe though)I would suspect that this film was made by college students as a project, or to try and waste tape (probably the latter).Too obvious for a thriller and too tame for a horror, if you're looking for scares look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vivid, Violent, And Vacuous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror of horrors describes its popular reputation. The images are vivid. The action is violent. And the characters are vacuous. Whatever a viewer thinks of this film, he or she is not likely to forget it.Five youthful hippies driving through rural Texas in a van get more than they bargained for when they encounter a bizarre looking hitchhiker near a slaughterhouse. From this point on, van occupants' luck goes from bad to worse. The first-half plot, during daytime, trends somewhat dull, though some scenes foreshadow what is to come in the second half.As dusk settles in, the horror action heats up, peaking in the dead of night. Indeed, the scariest scenes are those that take place outdoors in the dark. One sequence in particular is frightening; two characters trudge through thick brush with just a flashlight. Suddenly upon them is the face of a maniacal man with a buzzing chainsaw. The lighting on the man's face, and the suddenness with which he attacks, creates a bogeyman straight out of a child's nightmare.But what is the point of the movie? Apparently there is none, apart from provoking sheer fright. Those sequences that are most disturbing could be condensed into about twenty to thirty minutes. Much of the rest of the plot is filler, to extend the runtime so as to ensure a full-length movie.That's not the only problem. The story tells us nothing about the characters, either the five hippies or the villains. What's their history; what is their motivation? We don't know. They're all arbitrary, vacuously unimportant, in the script's quest for terror.Cast and acting are largely irrelevant. Marilyn Burns gives a good performance, but she has more opportunity to act than the others. Performances of the villains are all outrageously hammy; they act like they've got mad cow disease. Visuals trend grainy. Sound effects are good. Interior sets are appropriate for the genre and could be described as garbage Gothic.Being a work of fiction, the story is not very imaginative. But it is simple and straightforward, absent any subtext to interfere with the vividly clean images of horror and violent action. I guess that's what viewers most want in this film genre. And the film delivers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only film to ever scare me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gripping, terrifying and devastatingly upfront. There is nothing that quite compares to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, even though several sequels, a remake and a prequel have since been made. Not to mention countless other slasher films that have no doubt been influenced by this incredible film. So what makes this better than the rest? There are many reasons. The story is allowed to build up and the plot is actually realistic and believable, unlike so many modern horror films. Leatherface is huge, brutal and merciless - he's simply terrifying. The sound effects fit the movie and the setting and horror house (filled with bones and skin masks etc) substantially adds to the realism and fright of the movie.There is a huge sense of mystery within this film and the tension builds up unbearably. We are kept guessing the outcome right till the end. The dinner scene is possibly the most harrowing moment of film ever. There is no sense of the supernatural here; It feels horribly real.Please Ignore all the bad ratings of this film! Of course if you don't enjoy horror movies you're definitely not going to like this. What makes this film greater is that the killer's background and motives aren't explained. The unknown is one of the most frightening thoughts. Not every little detail has to be revealed.Definitely not for the faint hearted. Be prepared to be shocked and scared in the extreme without barely witnessing a drop of blood. A true classic; Something that you must see at least once in your life. Forget the remake, this is the real deal. The film was always meant to be twisted and horrible and this is very much achieved</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So the first twenty minutes of this movie consists of the ride there with nothing happening except for talking about a slaughter house and being disgusting. The meet a hitchhiker which is important to the later plot but seems random at the time. Then when they finally get where they are going after being advised thoroughly by gas station man to not go there. Then within the next ten minutes everybody but one girl dies. This is only roughly thirty minutes in the whole roughly hour and ten minute movie. The rest of the move consists of the surviving girl screaming. Then at the end she makes it to a road that in ten minutes sees more traffic than it has the entire film. When she makes it to the road a semi pulls up with Mr big black and here to help who instead of getting the girl in the truck and driving away, they get in the truck and come out the other side and hit Mr.Chainsaw in the head with a wrench. Then Mr.chainsaw cuts his thigh open. A pick up truck pulls up and screaming girl jumps in the back. The truck pulls away with her still screaming while Mr. Chainsaw proceeds to dance in the middle of the street. You never figure out what happens to Mr. Big black and here to help and she never stops screaming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow...this is one scary movie. I mean that. It is gritty, harsh, scary, violent, but not overly gory...creatively directed, good acting from an unknown cast...this is just one of the best exploitation horror films ever made. I first watched it alone in the dark. Boy, did I have nightmares. From the opening sequence to the final frame, I was terrified. The story is simple: five teens driving through rural Texas, who stumble upon a houseful of homicidal, cannibal killers, lead by obese, cackling, transvestite Leatherface, who enjoys torturing his victims before he murders them, and taunting heroine Sally. The chase sequences are literally gut-wrenching. You will be on the edge of your seat. The murders are quite shocking, and there is some splatter, but don't expect buckets of gushing blood. Mallets crack skulls, meathooks are shoved through bare backs, chainsaws carve up bodies and plunge into twitching torsos...not for the weak of heart, obviously. One of the scariest, most powerful horror films ever made. Don't see the sequels. They all stink.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's the point of movies with a point?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lets get real, people, there is no good reason for a filmmaker to force some kind of point on someone. Do you watch films to get lectured for 2 hours, or because you enjoy films? When you look at a bed of roses, do you try to figure out what they mean? No, you enjoy them for what they are. Why should it be any different for any other visual or aural experience? If you want a lecture, go watch an episode of 7th Heaven.With that said, "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is a film without much of a point, and rightfully so. It is shocking not because of graphic violence, but because how the violence is handled - we are left unaware of the full extent of the murders, forcing us to use that wonderful thing called imagination. These days many films have forgotten that lost art of giving the audience the credit it deserves by allowing the viewer to imagine what may or may not be. As Fritz Lang once said "It is best not to show acts of violence on screen because the viewers will imagine the worst". "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" had an interesting approach to this method: the violence was implied, sometimes vaguely shown, and its after-affect celebrated in its full and splendid glory. The result is an unfinished painting, yet enough evidence is provided so that anyone with some imaginative sense can paint in the missing parts. Of course, it's an unfortunate fact that not all of us are blessed with this gift of imagination, and those poor individuals are unlikely to appreciate what they see here. So, if you like horror and gore, but lack imagination, please feel free to check out those lame Scream movies, or the 945867987 episodes of Friday The 13th, or EvilDead. But if you're able to use your brain, then you should be able to recognize "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" for the important work of art that it really is.Highly recommended jolly-good family fun for all!!</fullReview>

Typically, the longer this heavily flawed genre is out there the quicker it attracts a 'cult' following. My advice to anyone who hasn't seen it is don't bother you'll feel profoundly disillusioned long before the welcoming relief of the end creditsI've watched the film twice but I only endured it on the second occasion in the nineties because I felt I had to try and comprehend what the hell all the fuss was about - Believe me I really worked hard to be more open minded the second time around. Maybe I had missed something ???? Er NO I was right the first time. Side splitting chase scenes reminiscent of Benny Hill and arse dragging dialogue. Characters so limp, you just wished they would get carved up in the first ten minutes. Compare this to Halloween, Night of the Living Dead, Psycho or the brilliant, cheaply made Blair Witch... yes entirely the the wrong films to compare since they are raw chiller classics that scream the 'x-factor' where horror films are concerned.</fullReview>

I saw it when I was 17 and it left me exhausted, shocked, sickened. I´ve seen it a lot of times more since then and it still produces in me the same sensations. it´s one of the most powerful and intense films in History, and from the moment it was released has become an absolute classic. I cannot imagine horror genre without this 84 minutes of pure geniality. the wonderful spanish DVD edition (Manga Films) is a must for all horror fans. the sequel is even more abbrasive, sadistic and grotesque, but in general absolutely unnecesary.</fullReview>

And, I certainly have no doubt about that.Featuring the obese, chainsaw-wielding, transvestite known as "Leatherface" - I have to admit that this truly disturbing picture did, indeed, contain some priceless moments of unintentional humour, as well.And, I, for one, was glad for that - 'Cause this certainly helped to alleviate some of the overbearing and oppressive brutality that prevailed throughout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Torrance + Frankestein = LeatherfaceThe opening alone, with the fading documentary type text that reads as if it was found in old newspaper, makes the terrorizing idea of it being real (it was based on a serial killer, but not chainsaw wielding lunatic and his family). The prologue sets you into the most unique, originally dark slasher of grotesque horror "in the annals of American history, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre". In case you were not already tensing yourself in first few minutes for what will be the most raw-meaty chunks you've ever tasted in the petrifying mold your sinking into, it sounds off Polaroid shutters of snippets of your next nightmare of decaying bodies. The first frame of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" I saw at a young age by some forgotten circumstance (I think maybe my uncle had it VHS and got my hands on it); when played, it was in the middle of the movie, when the disabled character in the wheel chair get's chainsawed by Leatherface. It was only a few seconds of one or two frames. The after effect on me was so strong, it took me long enough to watch all the other horror movie monsters, Freddy, Michael Myers, Ghostface, Pinhead. Before my subconscious felt I was ready for a horror fueled, heart pounding experience that this movie is. It still is one of the few guaranteed horrors to still give me goosebumps, with every watch. 5 young, dumb and full of cum college aged friends are on route through the colorful county of Texas to check on a relatives grave sight, after some gruesome "macabre" reports, that the bodies were being exhumed and put on display as corpse art. Right after finding the grave was undisturbed, the group pick up a greasy-green hitchhiker who give them a freak-show like they ain't ever seen. When he starts to cut his palm bloody and then lunatically cut the forearm of Franklin, the disabled member of the lot. After the run-in with Charles Manson, that would question anybodies further intention of heading further into this land of madness, they head to their old, abandoned family home. Where their worst nightmare lives just next door. The family of cannibalistic, inbred, crazed killers whom treat outside people like cattle of food and meat. They witness terror in its most animalistic - broken - taboo - tribal - mechanistic - bloodthirsty - fiendishly sweet - rotten flesh of decaying puke - uncensored - ripping - inhuman, form in the Sawyer family. The first few minutes is a slow descend into "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" world, to let the psychology changing motion picture do something that wont ever be achieved again with a talented, mainly lucky capture of a screenplay in the most rough style and actuation with pin point attention to detail &amp; with the help of a screeching, heart stabbing soundtrack; they all create something that can only be done with an endangered horror breed, that seems almost extinct since the 80's with copying, un-original evolved version that seem to never reach it's own style, like "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre". "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" conveys every phobia imaginable: spiders, sharp noises, blood &amp; guts, death, disability, CHAINSAWS, isolation, being chased, everything."The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," Evil Dead, I Spit on Your Grave; have made the chainsaw the most elegant, terror invoking weapon in horror films. Conclusion; I really need to start watching Tobe Hooper's (the director &amp; co-writer) filmography - all I have seen of his is this and Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2. I am sure I am missing out on some great films. One of the surest reason this film is great is Marilyn Burns performance in the final act. Where she, at multiple times releases a frighten state of hysteria you only feel when your in a bad dream and the watcher's relation to the film is with her survival, if she dies, so do we. Watching this now, after a long time, I can see how great it is. Easily in the top 10 greatest horror movies ever made. Where Stanley Kubrick's, The Shining's horror is driven by pure genius, Tobe Hooper gives it to you raw, border crossing, angry and your face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is often said that what makes a horror movie truly terrifying is one simple phrase to accompany all the bloodshed, ' Based on a true story'. Never has this been more true for a movie than in 'Texas chainsaw massacre'! As we see the scenes of brutality on our screen, and acts of cannibalism and body dismemberment we think that surely it can only be a thing of imagination, the creation of a writer, only before we will grimly remember that ominous message that we saw at the beginning. It is for this reason, and many others, that this goes down as one of the all time greats of the horror genres. Leather face is among the most iconic of all film characters. From his barely human grunts for communication to his foul acts, he will be remembered with other classics like Michael Myers and Hannibal Lecter. In an ideal world, I would have liked a slightly longer movie but I am aware that is a sort of cap on how long a film of this genre can be before it gets boring and repetitive so I don't hold this against the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film follows a group of friends who fall victim to a family of cannibals while on their way to visit an old homestead. Although it was marketed as a true story to attract a wider audience and as a subtle commentary on the era's political climate, its plot is entirely fictional; however, the character of Leatherface and minor plot details were inspired by the crimes of real-life murderer Ed Gein.Great Film, its fantastic and remarkable what Tobe Hopper managed to do with such shoestring budget, Very graphic and chilling film, but above all quite realistic and a landmark in bout horror genre and independent movie making. My vote is 8.Title (Portugal) - "Massacre no Texas" ("Massacre in Texas")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deep cultural horror disguised as conventional slasher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stating that Texas Chainsaw Massacre (TCM) is disguised as a conventional slasher is a bit of stretch in itself as the movie was released before the slasher genre made its way into the mainstream with movies such as Halloween (1978), Friday the 13th (1980), A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984). However TCM acted as a trailblazer for the genre and laid out the "rules" that the following movies would utilize and manipulate. The style of TCM differs from the typical Gothic horror of earlier Hollywood horror films as well as the suspense horror that was made popular by Alfred Hitchcock in the middle of the 20th century. TCM focuses on our own cultural anxieties in the build-up and the completion of the victim's journey. By drawing upon these shared fears and anxieties the film is able to touch the audience on a very personal level and by creating characters that are relatable it all becomes much more real and frightening.In TCM we can quickly establish that the band of friends who are driving through the remote Texas landscape (which is actually 30 minutes from Austin ? The capital of Texas) are "? attractive, energetic actors who radiate good health and normality" (Dika 1987:89). Except for maybe the most peculiar character of the group, Franklin, the paraplegic brother to the film's heroine Sally. Franklin's dependency and helplessness acts as a slow burning catalyst for our excitement in the narrative build-up. We are left speculating how he is going to survive what is coming (or how he will be killed). It is no secret that some running will be required on behalf of our victims at some point sooner or later; the movie is called Texas Chainsaw Massacre after all. The introduction of the films legendary bad guy, Leatherface stands as one of horror cinemas finest bad guy introductions. It doesn't over compensate or tease the audience in any way, he shows up, does his thing and then disappears (the sound of that door closing will stay with you forever). What makes Leatherface who he is is the mask he wears made out of human stitched together human faces. The face that he wears a mask is a very important tool from the filmmaker's side in order to dehumanize him. They control the amount of information the audience are able to decode in relation to the killer by making him wear a mask. The access we get to the look and personality of Leatherface is extremely limited and by dehumanizing him in this fashion it is left to the audience to use their imagination in order to give him form. Because of this the audience is left unable to identify with the killer in any way (hopefully), which serves to make him all the more horrifying. To sum it all up, Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a groundbreaking, low budget, horror movie that alters all the previous rules in the genre while comfortably establishing a new set of guidelines for subsequent movies in the genre to follow. If you feel like taking a break from the modern gore-dependent slasher horror films being spat out by Hollywood then take a trip back to the early dawn of the low-budget slasher genre with Texas Chainsaw Massacre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: First you'll see it; then you'll talk about it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974). This movie is apparently based off a true story, I'm going to say it right now it's not based off a true story, however it is based of real life events of serial killer Ed Gein he also inspired Silence of the Lambs and Psycho (you can look up his crimes if you want but a word of warning they are incredibly disturbing). To start off this movie is set in a weird documentary like style of filming, I really like this because it makes it feel very real. The movie's performances from the Sawyer family, they're all incredibly crazy and the actors did a great job of showing off the insanity and of course we have Leatherface the most disturbing movie serial killer for the fact that he wares human skin as masks and that his family eats their victims. Gunnar Hansen does a great job portraying Leatherface and fun fact: Gunnar came up with the idea that Leatherface should be retarded. For a low budget grindhouse movie (cheap horror movies from the 70s using gore as their main selling point) the cinematography is great, all the interesting shots are top notch. The movie is also just so disturbingly frighting, the whole entire Sawyer house is filled with the dead skulls, bones, and skins of dead humans (very similar to the Ed Gein crimes) all of it makes you just very disturbed what also helps for the disturbing atmosphere with the cast and other things. Last thing to touch up on the movie has one of the most thrilling climaxes I've seen in any movie EVER! The last 15 minutes just never let up stuff keeps getting thrown at you, its just great! Final thoughts are that The Texas Chainsaw Massacre deserves the title of most disturbing movie ever made, it has great cinematography, acting, and atmosphere all lead by the amazing direction of Tobe Hooper, I will give Texas Chainsaw Massacre a 9.7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Had considered myself a very well-experienced horror fan. I had seen all the classics, and had considered myself immune to actually getting scared during movies. I was wrong. I just spent the last 83 minutes in a cold sweat, eyes glued to the screen. This movie had me on edge from the intro monologue and did not let up. The best thing about this movie is the creepy atmosphere, which was brilliantly done. It had the tension raised long before Leather-face even appeared. The kills were extremely brutal, especially for the time period. The acting was spot-on, and added to the effect of the film. Watch this movie. It is without a doubt one of the best and scariest of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of teenagers on a road trip... OH BOY!!! HERE WE GO AGAIN... the typical horror movie set up. But wait.... something sets this one apart... IT'S SCARY... to be more precise, IT'S TERRIFYING!!! And I'm not just talking about the horrible 70's clothing and hairstyles. This film is one of the very few films I consider scary. Let me list a few reasons:1) The gritty documentary feel the film has.2) The excellent performances by Edwin Neil (the Hitch-Hiker), Jim Seidow (The Old Man), and Gunnar Hansen (Leatherface) as the psychos (in a film this low budget and grainy, performances this real feel all the more scary) and Marilyn Burns (Sally) and Paul A. Partain (Franklin) as the victims (we truly believe and feel their fear).3)The atmosphere (the skeleton bone art... the freaky metal door in the farmhouse... Leatherface's mask and demeanor... even the way the sun sets in this film is spooky along with the sound of the farmhouse generator).4)Relentless Horror (Leatherface RUNS not speedwalks after his victims with a live chainsaw... there's no time to trip and fall or your booty is chainsaw bait)5)The ability the film has to scare you with almost a complete lack of gore (the only "gory" scene is when Leatherface accidentally cuts his thigh with the chainsaw). The scares lie within the performances and atmosphere and pacing.In closing... this is truly the greatest horror film (and one of the greatest films period) ever made. 15 out of 10!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal and disturbing! True Shock Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was quite aware of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre's fame for quite some time, and also some scenes in it. It wasn't until today that I actually saw it in it's entirety. Did it disappoint? Not. At. All.The film has a gritty look to it, sort of 'cheap' and exploitative, and that works for it all the most. I was not once bored, and the story is simple, but when it comes down to the first encounter it made me jump. The film isn't really suspenseful or slow-burning once it hits what it's supposed to, but for this film it works of course. It's overwhelming in it's direction, in it's effect it has on us. It never truly lets go and the actors have to be given credit for really putting themselves up for this journey entirely. I mean, it's sure to take a physical and emotional toll on them. This is definitely a very disturbing film with no limits, and I know a film like this may leave many questioning why a film like this has to even exist, since it's intention lies in being able to be unpleasant. But, that's what horror is, and this is the ultimate film in shock cinema. I also think as a film it is much better than Craven's The Last House on the Left (although as far as remakes go, the new remake of Last House on the Left is much better than the 2003 Texas Chainsaw remake).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original version of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is very unsettling and scary. It's about the 'so-called' famous case of 'the Texas chainsaw massacre' where a group of friends on a road trip on a hot summer afternoon became a nightmare when they became terrorised by a bizarre family of cannibals.Although The Texas Chainsaw Massacre claims to be a true story, it's not so don't worry. Although the main villain, Leatherface (Gunner Hansen) is a homage to the real life serial killer, Ed Gein.If you're looking for a really good scare, then check this one out, but make sure it's not the crappy 2003 remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, now I've seen many horror films in my time. But this is definitely the one you need to see if you want to get scared to death. This is Tobe Hooper's cult classic horror flick that does one thing that many other horror movies don't. This film gives you scares from beginning to end. It starts off with a camera flashing on skeleton corpses and end with ''Leatherface'' swinging a chain saw AHHHH!! This film has a lot of terrifying moments, like when the "dead" grandfather hits Marilyn Burns in the head with a sledge hammer. This is one classic that will NEVER disappoint you, it gives amazing scares and will have you trembling throughout. This movie is positively ruthless and will drive you right out of your mind. So this is definitely a true horror classic that I recommend to anyone who wants a good scare. I give this film a 10/10. Tobe Hooper, your the MAN!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is a a very powerful movie that to this day, after more than thirty years after its release still harbors false images. there is nothing sadder than when someone makes a judgment on this film because of its title. the film is not excessive in any way what so ever, it is shocking,but in a emotional sense. there are no scenes of eyes being pupped out, or being disemboweled, but instead a nerve racking descent into madness and the macabre. the film is frequently passes over as a piece of trash because or the image it fosters. it is said to be rubbish and have no motivation or characterization for the actors on stage. however, watch Gunnar Hansen's leather face run to the window after his privacy has been invaded. watch this,and you will not see a blood thirsty maniac but instead a frightened individual who felt he had no other choice. every thing about this film is breath taking, the scenery, camera work,and the nightmare logic. the film remains deeply unpleasant to watch-but that is because it is so real that we have no objections that it could be real.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie! Okay the acting isn't great, the story is a bit lacking and some of the chase scenes could have been done a little better, but I still love this movie! It's the only horror movie ever in my opinion that sucks the viewer into a living hell and will not give you a break. No pointless cuts to police stations and cops looking for the killers, no deviations over to peripheral characters to let you catch your breath. Once the tension and terror in this movie starts it simply does not let up. You're right there with poor Sally through the entire grisly ordeal but you never for a second get numb to the situation. Other films have taken us right up to the abyss, maybe even given us a taste, but then like clockwork they all sell out. Well not this one. Tobe Hooper stuck to the basics and delivered and it's a shame that no one has really stepped up to the plate since then. A few though have made valiant efforts that I feel are worth mentioning: Haneke's FUNNY GAMES was definitely disturbing and grueling but it was a little too existentialist and experimental to truly terrify (I know that was the point). Aja's HAUTE TENSION got too splatter happy and blew it in the end with a bogus 11th hour twist. Back to TCM. The tone of dread and madness never breaks once. No comic book style killings, no slow motion action, no overdone blood effects or gore, and for the love of God no mood-stifling pop soundtrack complete with the latest top 10 single by Nickelback or Limp Bizkit at precisely the wrong time (this one infuriates me to no end). Just terror and panic in a dire situation. See this movie if you have ever wondered about the random things that can happen in this world and the darkness that hides in actual people. See this movie for a lesson in simplicity. Long live the saw.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been said before, off course, but if you're looking for wisecracks and gore, watch Evil Dead (wich is great) or any 90's 'modern' slasher movie (not so great). I haven't seen the remake yet, but I heard the director planned to make it "less gorie". That's quite impossible. Up until the final scene there is a tiny bit of blood (from scratches and cut fingers mostly) and definitely no gore. And the movie is all the more nasty and disturbing for it. As Jonathan Ross said on Film 2003: "for regular viewers it's sometimes unbearable to watch". Not scary, but very unpleasant. A classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there is any hidden message in "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" then it is that stupid, buttholes, who are young deserve to die. Comments made towards this movie might actually prove it to be true, but I wouldn't want to say that since I am merely 20."The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" is vaguely based on the northern midwest madman of the 1950s, Ed Gein. So, like any movie slightly based upon a Wisconsin serial killer, it takes place in the dead summer of desolate Texas.We follow 5 pricks, who are like most people that age but we all fail to recognize it. They are driving out to a grave yard to see if Sally's (Marilyn Burns) and Franklin's (Paul A. Partain) grandparents graves were victims of a rash of grave robbing.The movie starts off fairly normal. We see these kids out in the middle of nowhere in Texas. The grave checking is over with fairly quickly. Then they start off and Franklin informs us of how they kill cows at slaughter houses and then we meet a weird hitchhiker (Edwin Neal). He shows us pictures of slaughtered cows and then informs me on why I will never eat headcheese.Well, he then goes psycho, is throw out and all ends well. We go to an old family home, it is abandoned. To make a long story short, one by one (in some cases by two) they each wander off and in end up at an old house and meet up with the infamous Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen).As you have probably been informed by now, is that gore is little seen in this movie. There is no nudity, no sex, and only a couple shots of profanity.But, despite the ignorance of my generation, who are to numbed to understand atmosphere unless it involves guts and boobs, this movie is disturbing, in a different sense.The grainy feel of the film, the whole low budget rawness add a priceless feel to this movie. The work and detail placed into making the home of this family of cannibals is amazing. The weird camera movement does not take away from this movie. It adds to the atmosphere of confusion.Does it have it's flaws? Sure, the ending is inane and the characters could've been a little more relatable to the audience. But I think the distance created between not knowing the characters kind of adds to the movie just as much as it takes away. When someone is murdered and you hear about it on the news, you don't now them. Does it make you feel sorrow? I'd hope so.Unlike the sleek slasher films of today, this movie is dirty and raw, like a horror movie should be. This also shows a much truer version of serial killers than the Hannibal films. I am huge fan of two of those movies but Hannibal Lecter couldn't exist in real life. These people could and in fact have."Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer" is much better than "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" at showing you the reality of the mind of a murderer. But this one wasn't trying to be that, it just happened to mix that in.One of the best slasher films of all time, I give it a 7.5. The acting is sub par but for a horror flick it is great.One knock on this movie is the lack of a plot. Could you show me a slasher film that does have plot and was the better for it? I didn't think so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its amazing what your imagination can do to you. "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" uses your imagination like no other film. You never really see the gore,you just think its there, and that can be more frightening than any bloody "Friday The 13th"-ish gut-spilling violence. This film, along with Wes Craven's "Last House On The Left" and the "Night Of The Living Dead" films changed the way Americans looked at horror movies. It made the films more real, brought the violence closer to home in a way. Due to lack of funds, the movies were filmed cheaply, adding a documentary quality that eliminated all detachment the viewer has from the screen. Based loosly on the murders of Wisconsian serial killer Ed Gien, "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is full of bizzar and macabre imagery, much of it taken from the Ed Gien murders. In fact, imagery is the only thing that is taken from the murders, otherwise the story is completly fictional (a lampshade made of human skin, for example, was actually found in Gien's home). You may not like this film, you may not think it's frightening, but it will certainly make you cringe and you will for certain be thinking about it late at night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite possibly the scariest horror film ever made. And it doesn't need gore, either!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was little, this film, like many others, intimidated me greatly, aided by all the warnings from my mother. So it took me a while to get my nerve up and rent the damn thing. I mean, I had been watching gory horror flicks since I was six, but this one just stood out. I had heard rumors that a girl gets her head cut off, a bunch of kids get brutally killed, cut up, and hung on hooks, and that other weird atrocities are committed, so I strayed away for awhile. Then, when I was in the sixth grade, my brother rented it against my will and I was forced to face my fears. After I was finished viewing it, I soon realized that there was absolutely NO large amounts of blood in the picture and that all the hype was b.s. I was actually kinda disappointed, but something pulled me in and I soon got the urge to rent it several more times. I then grew older and wiser, until "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" got better with each viewing. It still does till this very day.I love this movie. I truly do. It is one of the ONLY horror films I've seen that actually provides genuine scares, in the same ballpark as "Carrie" and "The Shining". Most horror is just a bunch of self-conscious and senseless gore and special effects, with no scares, no talent, and little shock value. Personally, I don't think a film has to be gory to be scary. In fact, I think the gore actually removes some of the calaustrophobic elements that truly make a film horrifying. I mean, look at the "Friday the 13th" series and see what I mean. TCM is practically goreless and is ten times scarier.The plot to this film is a basic one. A group of kids take a trip to the graves of their relatives to make sure they haven't been caught up in the current graverobbings and soon get caught up with a family of sadistic cannibals who proceed to terrorize them and . . . I think you get the message. Truly horrifying. The climax is one that is sure to freak anybody out, even if you think you've seen everything. It is extremely intense and enclosed, making it nightmare worthy. This film is disturbing me right at this very moment just thinking about it! I feel like I should watch it tonight or something.So make a point to view this picture and ignore all the hype about gore and crap. Everyone THINKS they're seeing blood, which makes this film so effective. The only blood that stood out in my mind was when Franklin got cut on the razor. That's it. But it doesn't mean that this isn't the most hardcore horror picture ever made. It just means that the filmmakers are accomplishing their goals, and that horror has gone straight to hell in the '90s. Just look at the meat hook scene and at its effectiveness. It always stands out in everybody's mind.#8 on my Top 200 List and GUARANTEED to freak you out. **** out of **** on my personal scale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greeting's boys and ghouls, 'tis I, Nailhead, the Ghastly Ghoulish Go Go Guru. Webmaster of The Saw Is Family, the greatest Texas Chainsaw Massacre site ever. I have come to give you my review of Tobe Hooper's 1974 classic, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre! The film begins with news reports of graverobbing, and continues with five youths checking on a family grave. This is where the film becomes a nightmare of horrific perportions. They pick up a maniacal hitchiker who assaults one of their group, and they end up wandering into the clutches of Leatherface and his flesh eating family, one by one. This films grabs you by the throat and does not let go until every ounce of life is squeezed out of you. The dinner scene is one of the most intense, psychologically terrorizing scenes in film history. The gore level in this film is absolutely zero, which makes it just the more terrifying. The acting is so great and so realistic, as is the way the movie was filmed, it gives you the feeling that this is more of a documentary then a movie, which boosts the terror level 100 fold. Do yourself a favor, go see The Texas Chainsaw Massacre now, I guarantee you will never be the same!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having read everywhere that this was the scariest movie ever made I was scared witless sitting in the cinema waiting for it to start. In fact though, it's really not all that frightening. It's slightly chilling, and some of it is very uncomfortable viewing, but I found all the screaming and dissonant music more annoying than terrifying. I did however think it was pretty funny in places, especially at the end, and it is undoubtedly a very creative and original piece of cinema.Incidentally, the print I saw at Shaftesbury Avenue in London was very poor. I know it was shot in 1973 on 16mm but it was badly scratched, and the colour was all over the place. In one scene, Marilyn Burns went from blonde to brunette to blonde again in about 10 seconds!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reports of grave robbing has a sister and brother traveling to rural Texas with their friends, so they can see if their grandfather's grave has been desecrated. But their trip takes a horrifying and gruesome turn they couldn't possibly have imagined. Most of the horror movies I have found genuinely frightening in my life have dealt with things like ghosts, exorcisms, and things that go bump in the night. When it comes to people being chased by lunatics with masks, I usually don't find that very scary. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, however, is a notable exception. It's a truly harrowing experience when you watch this movie for the first time. Or at least it was when I first saw it, years before the countless imitators began cropping up. I'm lucky in that respect, I suppose. I really don't know how this holds up for a generation that has unfortunately seen the copycats before the original. I can only hope intelligent younger viewers will be able to recognize how groundbreaking and shocking this was for its time, and how well it still holds up in today's era of glossy horror movies that offer few scares.It's easily Tobe Hooper's best directorial effort. He paces the film well and builds the tension before the explosive final half-hour, which is just insanity that will have you glued to your seat. His direction is creative and fresh, giving the film a unique look and sound that was unlike anything that had come before. Nothing he would do later (and he would still do some good movies) would match the brilliance of this film. This was followed by sequels, prequels, and remakes. Only the first sequel did Hooper have any creative involvement and it was a completely different experience than this. The majority of these later efforts are garbage made by imitators that only seem to get what made TCM work on a surface level. Marilyn Burns is screaming a lot? Okay, let's have our characters scream even louder and longer! Stupid stuff like that, which only serves to show these filmmakers as the posers they are, not innovators. It's a hugely influential film that ranks up there in the top five horror movies of all time, in my opinion. So many parts of this are iconic and, frankly, taken for granted by many today. If you haven't seen it, please do so on an appropriately dark night. If you're a younger viewer looking to get into older horror films, this has to be one of your first stops. It's a classic everybody should see at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Rawness Still Can't Be Matched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) *** (out of 4)Tobe Hooper's 1974 film has been written about so many times that it's hard to say anything new or fresh on it. The film's story is quite well-known but five teenagers stop at an old farm house when their van is running low on gas. Soon, one by one, they wonder over to another farm house, which has a homicidal family of cannibals.THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE is certainly one of the highlights of the genre and there's no doubt that it's one of the most influential movies ever made. Watching the film today it's easy to see why this would have scared and shocked people so much when it was released because there's just a certain realism and rawness that hasn't really been matched in the forty-plus years that have followed. I will openly admit that I still think there are several flaws in the movie but none of them take away from the power that is here.Hooper's direction is certainly one of the major pluses because of how bleak the film is. You can just feel the heat coming off the locations and there's no question that you can also feel the terror and horror in the characters as they reach their fate. Marilyn Burns' ferocious screams are now legendary but it's Teri McMinn's face and gasps on the hook that has always stuck out so much for me. The death scenes certainly aren't brutal or bloody but they have such an impact because of how realistic they are.The performances, for the most part, are good and there's no question that Burns screams in pain and agony unlike anyone before or since. Edwin Neal, Jim Siedow and Gunnar Hansen are certainly terrific and incredibly believable as the twisted family of wackos. The art direction is another major key as the inside of their house is still beautifully done and there's no doubt that it remains influential to this day.As I said, I still think there are some flaws in the movie but there's no denying the impact that the film has made since its release. The rawness is something that many other films have tried to copy but no one has come close to Hooper's film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal and yet not filled with gore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre", Sally Hardesty, her crippled brother Franklin and three friends, go on a trip to Texas, to visit the grave of the Hardestys' grandfather to investigate reports of vandalism and grave robbing. After making sure that nothing happened to the grave, the five friends continue with their trip and they visit the Hardesty's old and abandoned house in the middle of the country. Near the house, there's a family of sadistic cannibals who will encounter the five friends and chase them, to torture them, kill them and keep them as trophies.What strikes me the most about this film is the fact that the amount of gore cannot even be compared to nowadays' standards and still manages to be extremely brutal and disturbing. While I appreciate subtle horror, I don't stubbornly defend subtlety as a rule for quality horror. Certainly, I can highly enjoy films that don't have a drop of blood, like "The Others" or "The Blair Witch Project" to name a few, but that doesn't mean that I want all my horror films to be gore-less. Now, saying that "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" doesn't have any gore would be a bit of a stretch, but it's certainly not the reason why I would consider this film disturbing and brutal. The reason why this film was so controversial (to the point of being banned in several countries) may have to do with the fact that, even though it's clearly a movie, there's something oddly realistic about it. While it's not a "found footage" or "real footage" type of film, I felt like I was watching a documentary or a snuff film. It's strange, because the acting is not particularly realistic, but somehow, Tobe Hooper successfully creates a very realistic and unsettling atmosphere that makes it look like everything is real. The fact that the actors were unknown and are not particularly famous nowadays either, also contributes to this strange feeling of realism. The film opens with a voice narrating the story, as if it was based upon actual events, which clearly contributes to the realistic sensation. Needless to say, this is all fiction and not really based upon actual events. If anything, it is loosely based on the American killer Ed Gein, a man from Wisconsin who became notorious because he had exhumed corpses from local graveyards and fashioned trophies from their body parts. The point is: even though the audience is aware that this is not real, it still feels real anyway and that's what makes the film so unsettling, in my humble opinion.The acting in this film is also very good. Marilyn Burns, who plays Sally Hardesty, the main character, is one of the most iconic horror girls for a reason. Her transformation all throughout the film is outstanding, and her acting skills can be appreciated mostly by the end of the film, when her character starts going insane, as a result of all the horrible situations that she has to suffer. Edwin Neal, who plays the eccentric and gross hitchhiker, does a very good job too. I still cringe every time his character appears for the first time. While it's not particularly disturbing or certainly not the most disturbing part of the film by a long shot, the scene where the group of friends decide to pick up the hitchhiker makes me feel really uncomfortable, and I think it's mostly due to the good acting.Honestly, there's little to say about a film like "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" that hasn't been said before, but I have been a great fan of this film for about 10 years and I think it's time I leave my review as a way to pay my respects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My favorite horror film!First off this movie is just creepy and bizarre. It comes at you with full force and has no pity on the audience. I honestly have not seen anything like this. The thing that scared me the most is when the family tortures Sally at the end, it was so intense and real. Marilyn Burns's performance was too believable, making the all the more disturbing. Franklin was zoo annoying (great acting). And this movie had the creepiest opening scene ever, I loved the beeping sound it was very creepy. Over all this is a great film you shouldn't miss.My rating: Rated R- for intense violence and torture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't let the low-budget label fool you. This film is well-acted, well made, and probably the most frighteningly effective horror film you will ever see.Tobe Hooper doesn't need another achievement in his life. he is set in the annals of horror with this film. Along with George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead, and Wes Craven's video nasty The Last House on the Left, this film is firmly in the Horror Hall of Fame. (While this wasn't a video nasty, Hooper did make the list with Funhouse.) The film was banned in several countries, but subsequently re-rated and allowed in.The scene where Pam (Teri McMinn) is squirming on a meat-hook while Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) is chainsawing Kirk (William Vail) was pure horror.I can't say I was upset when Leatherface took the chainsaw to Franklin (Paul A. Partain). he was really getting on my nerves.Sally (Marilyn Burns) was the only one to get out alive, if that really made any difference to her because having grandpa (John Dugan) sucking on my fingers would traumatize me.I've been on the highway to Childress (287) more than a few times. Let this be a lesson - don't get off the main roads in Texas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uniquely Pure Terror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are good Horror films, there are great Horror films, and then there are the essential classics that every lover of the Genre and everyone who claims to be a film fan simply HAS to see. And Tobe Hooper's original "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" of 1974 definitely belongs to this latter category. There are only a fistful of films which epitomize the term 'Horror' as this unforgettable masterpiece of low-budget Horror does. "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" has been called the purest Horror film of all-time, and it is indeed true that hardly another film delivers pure terror that could compare to this absolute classic of Horror's greatest decade, the gritty and brutal 70s. In the beginning, the film shows half-decayed corpses, bizarrely positioned on sticks in the desert. This opening sequence alone is capable of giving you the creeps.***SPOILERS!*** Loosely based on the crimes of insane hilly-billy serial killer Ed Gein, "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" tells the tale of five young people, who want to relax at their grandfather's old farm in Texas. As fate wants it, the neighbors are a demented family of chainsaw-swinging cannibals... A diabolical family of ultra-demented psychos, and a bunch of innocent victims, including two beautiful girls and a guy in a wheel-chair - The result is one of the most purely terrifying films ever brought to screen. The most memorable member of the psycho family, Leatherface, has long become one of the greatest icons of the Horror genre.As it must be the case with most of my fellow Horror fans, I have personally seen this film many times, and it never looses its incomparable morbidity and genuine creepiness. Overall, the storyline of "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" is quite simple, and while it is doubtlessly a Gore classic, films that were considerably gorier had been made before 1974. Neither does the film stun with technical superiority or the stylistic elegance that many Italian Horror films delivered at the day. What makes "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" so brilliant and uniquely scary is the key element that it delivers like hardly another film: Pure terror. Period. Hardly another film epitomizes the term Horror as this film does, hardly another possesses its incomparable morbidity. As mentioned before, the film is not nearly as gory as one might imagine. In fact, there is very little explicitly graphic gore. What makes this film so morbid and terrifying is that it feels so incredibly real. One almost has the impression of being there, the film will not only make viewers scared for the victims, it is capable of making the audience scared for their own ass. I could praise this film's terrifying greatness for a long time, but I'll just say that it is absolutely essential to see for everyone who is interested in Horror (in case there is anybody who hasn't already seen it). Tobe Hooper is a genius for accomplishing this film with a tiny budget of about 140,000 Dollars, and making it one of the most terrifying cinematic experiences ever brought to screen. No matter how many crappy remakes they make, this original "Texas Chain Saw Massacre" is one of the most influential, important and purest Horror films of all-time and no one interested in cinema can afford to miss it. An absolute must!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is what is says on the tin. To base itself on real life is to illustrate that true horror is not particularly interesting to the more normal of us. The function of this film is to make the viewer see the horror involved in being hunted for murder. That's all. The point is that to understand this film you must understand, as Dostoyevsky put it, the 'banality of evil'. In this way the film is merely presenting the truth. Horror in real life doesn't have 'tense music' or interesting 'baddies'. Ed Gein was not interesting. And to glamourise what he did would be to glamourise evil. That's why this film is remembered: for being unglamourous. And the banality is what makes it truly horrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The neverending myth. Time made justice to this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is part of the exclusive group of the considered "The Best Horror Movies of All Time", and it's place is very well deserved. TCM started the cannibal craziness that became very popular in the 70's and changed the horror genre without advice. Plus, Leatherface became an important icon to the genre. Tobe Hooper and Tim Henkel squeezed every cent of the ultra low budget they counted with to produce the movie. The result is one of the best horror movies ever made. Call me heretic but I consider TCM at the pair of "The Exorcist" and "Psycho", the most respected horror movies of all time. What these three horror masterpieces have in common is that each of them set standards and rules to the genre, in other words these movies changed the genre. You can love or hate these movies but you need to respect their hierarchy. I doubt someone could be against "Psycho" or "The Exorcist" because the names Hitchcock and Blatty impose respect because of their huge and respected trajectory. On the other hand, Tobe Hooper has been heavily criticized for his opera prima. TCM has been called "disgusting", "disturbing", "video nasty", and other adjectives. Divine Justice came to Hoooper and his movie is considered one of the most influential horror movies of all time. *SPOILERS* Most horror fans know the plot of TCM and those who haven't seen it have pretty much a general idea about it. Five young adults (Sally and Franklin Hardesty, Jerry, Pam, and Kirk) are terrorized by a cannibal family (this is the Sawyers). TCM features important moments in horror history and set standards that were later used in almost every horror movie (until today).One of the most shocking scenes in horror movies history is Leatherface's first appearance. His presentation couldn't be more scary and unexpected. The atmosphere is very creepy and dark, couldn't be more perfect for Leatherface's introduction to the horror world. After Kirk falls accidentally to the floor, Leatherface slams the door where he "prepares" dinner opening it and savagely hits Kirk in the head causing him a convulsion. Then he takes his dead body to his room and closes the door.Brilliant death and scene overall. The other death scenes are scary and perfectly done. Pam's death is perfect as your imagination plays an important part for setting a scary moment. Surprisingly, there's no blood but the scene doesn't need it. Jerry's death is also great and shocking but it's Franklin's death the most memorable on the movie. While he and Sally search in the woods for their friends, Leatherface suddenly appears and slaughters him with his chainsaw. The chasing scenes are the best you can get from in these kind of movies. The first one, when Leatherface carrying his chainsaw runs after Sally through the dark woods. This is the mother of all the chasing sequences in horror movies. The other happens in the end of the movie when Sally manages to escape from the demented family. The characters are something you haven't seen before. Unlike most horror films, TCM has four villains. Meet the horror icon Leatherface, The Cook, Hitch hiker, and Grandpa. Leatherface is probably the deadliest killer in the 70's horror movies. Before the 80's slasher craziness began, Leatherface showed that villains shouldn't be necessary unstoppable and immortal. With his hammer and his beloved chainsaw he could terrorize anyone. The Cook is an iconic character in the genre. He is insane but smart, and very violent. His attitude changed from moment to moment. At the beginning he behaves correctly while attending the gas station and at the ending when he's yelling, jumping, and hitting Sally you wonder if it's the same character. His acts are truly frightening. Hitch hiker is pure evil. He is totally insane, he doesn't behaves at any moment but is as deadly as Leatherface. His wicked behavior proved that he was a key element in the killings for the family's cause. Grandpa is something you need to see to believe.Great acting by Marylin Burns the first Slasher Scream Queen. Her performance is totally believable. You can say she really lived everything that was shown in the movie. The casting is excellent and you can't get much better in any other horror movie. Seems like the Sawyers were having a good time and all got along pretty good.Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE is a respected movie in the industry.It's an event that none horror movie fan should miss and this is a true horror movie. With minimal budget but a creative and wicked mind Tobe Hooper created one of the best horror movies of all time. No doubt about it. TCM is a reference to horror in general. It's part of movies history. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Highly intense, feverish low budget horror classic is simply one of the most nightmarish films of American cinema!!Young travelers in rural Texas keep having run-ins with weirdos that have a very strange taste for certain kinds of barbecue.Director Tobe Hooper is one of the best horror filmmakers of all time and it was this scary, influential masterpiece that brought him to horror fame. Hooper made the most of a low budget with this film, using the raw, gritty locations and even the grainy film stock to make this film seem terrifyingly realistic. From the eerie opening voice over to the sweat-inducing conclusion, Hooper rides the audience through a world of madness, violence, and darkness that is a pure assault upon the senses! Its extreme suspense and unsettling atmosphere make it the most gripping kind of horror film. Yet despite it's reputation, and the implication of the title, this film is a relatively gore-free movie! The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has far more psychological violence than it does physical violence, and that may just be the most effectively terrifying angle of this horror masterpiece. Hooper's direction is top-notch indeed! The music score is also nicely disturbing.The no-names cast works even better for the realism of the film, as they all put on convincing performances. Burns, Danziger, Vail, and McMinn make for familiar, likable teenagers. Partain does comic relief well in his some-what annoying role as Burns's invalid brother. But it's the villains of this film that have the most memorable performances. Neal is truly frightening as a loonie hitchhiker. Siedow is both darkly funny and scary as a seemingly harmless old man. And of course, Hansen is shockingly frightening as this films horror icon, Leatherface.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the greatest low budget horror films of all time, and probably one of the greatest horror films period! It is required viewing for genre fans.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Genuine Nightmare Captured on Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I avoided seeing this film for years; put off by the title and the gory reputation it had. When sheer curiosity finally got me to watch it a year or two ago, I was stunned by the raw, compelling power of the simple story and believable performances. Various viewers and critics have pointed out that this movie is about terror, not blood and guts for its own sake. We are shown just enough to raise uneasy questions that are never answered. The violence is startling and realistic, but not overdone. One good example is the scene in which SPOILERS AHEAD: Leatherface suddenly looms up out of the darkness, wielding his chainsaw, and kills the wheelchair-bound Franklyn, as Sally runs off screaming into the night. We are horrified by this brutal killing of a victim who has no hope of escape, but the murder is played for shock, not disgust. We are not shown the gruesome details of Franklyn's death; the idea is enough. It may be this down to earth approach to violence that helps make the movie so unnervingly believable. We are not dazzled or amused or grossed out by gory special effects for their own sake, as in so many horror movies made after this one, but just plain scared. One of the most powerful aspects of this movie is the ordinary settings and characters. The victims are all people that most viewers could relate to as being like ourselves or people we know. Their uncomprehending reactions to their fate, or their terrified inability to escape are part of what terrifies the audience. The dinner scene where captive Sally tries to reason with her tormentors, and her go-for-broke escape attempt at the end are totally believable. The weirdness of the cannibal family is offset by their oddly routine behavior; that there is a certain bizarre logic to the way they live, however insane. One of the most often referenced bits is when the older man, presumably the father of the other two, exclaims to Hitchhiker with great indignation, "Look what your brother did to that door!", and shortly after, chases Leatherface around with a belt, acting like a typical father irritated by his offspring's dumb behavior. The unexpected and outlandish humor of the movie also contributes to its effectiveness. These incongruous black comedy moments occurthroughout the film, and add to the horror, rather than diminish it. The performances throughout, by both victims and killers, are simply great, especially the tour de force by Marilyn Burns as Sally, the only one to survive. Her whole ordeal and repeated attempts to escape, only to be caught again, until her final successful getaway, are alarmingly convincing. It's hard to remember that what you're seeing is " only a movie", due to the acting and Hooper's skillful direction. Finally, the look of the film, and the strange music, both contribute enormously to the eerie spell this movie casts. One can almost feel the heat of that dry, dusty Texas plain, the monotony of driving endlessly down an unfamiliar road, the creepy feeling of walking into a strange house to ask for help. The strange, spooky feeling of the gas station at night, a tiny beacon of light and seeming normalcy in the midst of darkness and madness ,that turns out to be a false refuge, the ghoulish decorations and furniture made from human remains in the outwardly normal looking farmhouse. Watching this film is an uncomfortable experience, but every horror movie fan ought to see it at least once. In its own nightmarish way, it's a triumph of film-making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film for the very first time recently after having been too scared to watch it for years.While the film did not scare me as much as i was expecting there is no doubt it is a truly remarkable piece of horror cinema.The story is pretty much the run of the mill stalk n slash movie so there isn't really any need to go into it. What makes the film so exceptional is contrary to the films reputation there is the minimal amount of actual on screen gore or cheesy dramatic "horror music." Instead the film barrages you with raw psychological fear. The lack of over the top music leaves you with the terrified screams of the main characters as they confront their antagonists, as does the grainy looking film which makes it appear to be more of a home-movie gone wrong than a film at all.The appearance of Leatherface for the first time, for example is handled as casually as the appearance of any other lead character, but then of course we know the result of his appearance and cannot help but be shocked by what follows within the space of about 20 seconds afterwards.Make no mistake this film is a test in psychological strength and questions us what we would do in the situations as poor Marilyn Burns.While the film may look dated in this age of extreme gore and "jump scares" their is no denying the craft that has gone into this. There are some beautiful bits of camera-work and the little music that does occur is chilling and well used.The only real complaint is maybe the acting could have been tidied up in some parts, as could the character development so we truly feel for the other characters other than Sally. But this is a minor complaint and any true fan of real horror should see this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>contains mild spoilers...The first time I saw this movie I was in high school, on a kick for the classics of cult cinema (Evil Dead, Dawn of the Dead, you know), and I rented it. I was amazed, and actually a little disappointed, by the lack of gore - especially in the meathook sequence - and the general somberness of the movie's tone. When I saw it again, keeping in mind that it wasn't going to be campy or cheesy, though, it really started looking different... It's been beaten to death, but there is something about the grittiness of the film and the "amateurish" cinematography that makes the movie feel almost documentary-like. There's the fact that the movie basically foregoes plot and character development (at least, not the usual hamhanded, cliché'-driven character development that usually haunts horror movies) and instead provides a simple situation: A bunch of people, Texas, summer, an old house, some cannibalistic psychos. There's a sense of the irrevocable about this movie, and while your first instinct is to give the old "Don't go in there!!!!" shout when the guy first enters the old house, the movie doesn't give you time; he trips, and in comes Leatherface with a hammer. We don't get suspense; we don't get lurking shots from Leatherface's POV with muffled breathing: He shows up, and within two seconds someone's dead. And twitching. That may be one of the closest things to a real murder in any horror movie. The dinner scene works the same way; instead of cheesy gimmicks about the family, we just get the very common sense of being uncomfortable magnified, and magnified, and magnified, until it becomes impossible to tell what's real and what's not. It's madness. This movie doesn't need great special effects: Its fatalism, its filthiness, and its cruelty are all it needs. This is a truly horrifying movie.</fullReview>

The grandfather is supposed to be 108 yrs. old - also never stated. We NEVER see the family eating a human, or stating that they eat humans... we don't even see a person being ground into meat and cooked - where the hell did this cannibal thing come from? Only one person is killed via chainsaw; hardly a massacre.to hell with this film, and it's "cult" status... boring and bad filmmaking meant only to shock without any actual substance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>~Spoiler~ The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a very nasty little horror film. Tobe Hooper and crew created a masterpiece of cinematic terror in 1974. Rex Reed called it the most horrifying film he'd ever seen. On top of that, the film was selected for preservation in the Library of Congress. What more can I say about the film that hasn't already been said? Let's start with the icon: Leatherface. Gunnar Hansen's portrayal of Leatherface is one of the spookiest performances in any movie. He's menacing and ferocious, and at the same time meek and stupid. He's a danger to our heroine, but his family treats him as the runt. Leatherfaces' cohorts are played by Jim Siedow (the Cook) and Edwin Neal (the Hitchhiker). I can't say enough about these two guys. The Sawyer clan best represent madness, more-so than any other genre characters. Just look at the dinner scene. It's an all-out assault on your senses and the family is reveling in it while poor Sally is screaming her head off. Only when she bursts through the window is she back in reality. But the madness still doesn't stop. In fact, once the teenagers stumble across the Sawyer house, the terror doesn't let up. Not for a second. The grainy quality of the film gives it this eerily realistic and dirty feel. You can almost feel the heat of Texas through the camera lens. Cinematographer Daniel Pearl doesn't get enough credit for the look of the picture. And the fact that it is treated like a true account doesn't help to ebb your fear (it's actually based on Ed Gein). When you hear John Larroquette narrate the opening dialogue you know you're going to witness something special, and maybe something horrifying. It's an anxiety that will last the duration of the film. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a must see for all fans of the mad and the macabre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tobe Hooper created one of the most terrifying,disturbing and realistic films in horror genre history.There's a very little visible violence in this film,but the atmosphere of sheer dread and terror is simply overwhelming."The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" is loosely based on activities of Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein.Gein,a necrophiliac serial killer and devotee of the wartime Nazi concentration camp medical experimentalists is thought to have inspired the Alfred Hitchcock thriller "Psycho"(1960)and two low-budget horror movies "Deranged"(1974)and "Three on a Meathook"(1972)by his macabre deeds in the late 50's.On one occasion he plundered a Wisconsin graveyard by night for edible body parts,and flayed one corpse to fashion a waistcoat souvenir.Some time later,when police called at his house to question Gein about a missing elderly woman,they discovered the gutted torso of one of his earlier female victims hanging from the beams.In the basement of his house parts of human bodies hung from hooks on the walls,in the kitchen the refrigerator contained frozen body parts.Oh,and there was an armchair...with real arms.So it's really obvious that Leatherface brilliantly played by Gunnar Hansen was influenced by Ed Gein.The cinematography is grainy,even ugly-looking at times,the music composed by Tobe Hooper is genuinely creepy and the acting is brilliant."The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" is a REAL horror,and also an overwhelming assault on the viewer's senses.10 out of 10-surely they don't make them like this anymore.Along with "Last House on the Left"(1972)and "Cannibal Holocaust"(1979)this is one of my favourite horror movies from the 70's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterclass in horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Texas Chainsaw Massacre follows Sally Hardesty (Marilyn Burns) and four of her friends, including her invalid brother Franklin who spend the weekend in their Grandparents old house out in rural Texas, upon doing so they stumble across a cannibalistic family who pick them off one by one. Although this movie is over 40 years old and definitely looks, sounds and feels 'dated' - it doesn't detract from it at all, the grainy feel adds to the atmosphere of the movie. Shot on a modest budget of $140,000 this movie was a huge box office success, spawning several sequels, remakes and comic book spin offs. Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the cornerstones of modern horror, and it set the tone for generations to come - it manages to create a feeling of genuine terror through the use of atmospheric sounds, little gore and no true explanation as to why this cannibalistic family is the way it is, it just is. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre offers real performances across the board, from Marilyn Burns portraying Sally Hardesty to Gunnar Hansen who portrays Leatherface.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the scariest films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is often seen as one of the prime influences of slasher films. It popularized slasher films, and it is often used as a reference point for horror film directors. It's also a really good one at that. Tobe Hooper was able to make one of the scariest films of all time for several reasons. It's one of the biggest must-see films from the genre.After a series of grave robberies, 2 siblings, Sally and Franklin, drive out to Texas to see if their Dad's grave was robbed along with 3 of their friends. Afterwards, they stay at their family Homestead where they get attacked by a family of cannibalistic psychopaths. One of them named "Leatherface" has a mask on and is always silent.The camera-work is well-done. The film is shot like a documentary. Several conversations throughout the film feel like a character was being interviewed. Since the film infamously called itself a true story (which it wasn't), the documentary style camera-work made it all the more believable. It gave the film an unsettling sense of realism. Also, there are other shots later in the film which provide feelings of desperation and hopelessness. There are several close-ups on a characters eyeballs where tears can be clearly seen. These shots are just disturbing. Also, there are a few close-ups on the antagonists' faces. If a movie overdoes this, it can be annoying after a while, but since the movie didn't abuse this, I found them to be disturbing as well. Finally, there's the impressive final shot which gives you a dazzling composition of the sun and some great lighting to go out on.The acting is really good. I especially have to hand it to Marilyn Burns (Sally), because she gave the best performance in the film by far. Near the end of the film, there is a lot of screaming and crying. It's really hard to do this well. I bet that most other actresses wouldn't be able to play her part without sounding annoying or over-the-top. However, I can not think of a single time near the climax that I got annoyed with her. Her performance remained solid and convincing. Because her acting remained top notch, the climax continued to engage me. She helped the film to remain terrifying. The other 4 friends accompanying her gave great performances as well. Since Tobe Hooper directed this film to make it feel like a documentary, their acting helped to make the conversations feel like they were borrowed right out of one. Also, Edwin Neal gave a nice performance as the hitchhiker. His performance was really charismatic. Insanity can be a difficult emotion to pull off, because most of the time, actors sound over-the-top when they do it. However, he did a really good job at it.Despite what the film's title might lead you to believe, there's actually a lot less blood and gore in this film than you'd likely expect. I heard that this is the least goriest film from the franchise. That's another reason why it's so scary. It's able to generate terror from the audience without resorting to excessive bloody violence like many other slasher films do. Near the beginning of the film, it relies on suspenseful buildup and unexpected moments which are very shocking. Also, Leatherfaces' house has really good set design. A lot of work clearly went into it. Near the end of the film, it relies on great acting and camera-work and claustrophobia. It feels highly unlikely that the movie will have a happy ending, and it's hard to watch the ending because of this. It disturbs the viewer greatly.If you stop reading and look back at my review, you'd see that so far, just about everything which I've praised this film for all contributes to making it one of the scariest films ever made in one way or another. It masterfully utilized numerous horror techniques, and it combined them to make this film work so well.You likely won't be forgetting your viewing experience with this film anytime soon. However, it takes a while to get to the good parts. This film has pacing issues which painfully slow this film down. These issues come in play for the first half of the film. The audience impatiently waits for the film to pick up as its first half feels very slow-moving. Since the film is barely over 80 minutes, it can be extra tedious for that reason. On my 2nd viewing, I had slightly less of an issue with the pacing, but it still exists for the film.In conclusion, this is a really great film. It masterfully utilizes several horror techniques to make it one of the scariest films ever made. It's not perfect as its first half has pacing issues. However, it has accomplished a whole lot. I can appreciate it for being one of the main influences for slasher films. It set the standards very high, and it gave other slashers very big shoes to fill. I was originally going to add this film to my watchlist months ago. However, I completely forgot about it. It was only recently when I remembered it. Man, I was sure missing out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but I expected a bit more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I watched this movie, I was expecting something that would scare me more than just about anything I'd ever seen. Now that I've seen it, I'll say it was intense and interesting, and I particularly liked the way the ending was executed, but also that I've seen titles that are a lot scarier. I did admire the film's craftsmanship, pacing and the unique way it develops and executes its scares and sense of dread. One scene in particular was the film's high-point. Overall, the movie was good and interesting, especially for its time. I was just expecting it to be scarier. If you're looking for a good old-school scary movie, then this is probably up your alley.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best horror film in cinema history.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forgive me, human nerve King Alfred Hitchcock, Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau and others, but their films did not become a landmark horror. It Tobu Hooper managed to remove most fascinating and terrifying horror film, which can be a maddening anyone. An interesting idea director: people are afraid of something like that patient. So he made a film with a focus on the maniac with a chainsaw - nothing could be easier and better. Leatherface no less frightening Freddy Krueger, Jack Torrance and other lunatics in the world of cinema, and his chainsaw - like a symbol of human pain and fear captivating. Almost the entire film from the first murder scene, the viewer wilts in exciting fear and consternation, and closely following the fate of the poor five. Generally the very first stage appearance Bubba Sawyer (so called maniac Leatherface) most important is to compare with the scenes, for example, the eye cut in "Un Chien Andalou" and the scene in the shower in "Psycho." The latter is generally considered the best scene in horror movies, what can and to argue. The moment Kirk stumbles in the same frame appears Bubba - a reference sequence. In the course of the film, we learn that a whole family of cannibals living in the wilds of Texas. This gas station worker, strange hairy man, and even a grandpa, who for 130 years, but the one half-dead, yet can kill. We can say - what a crazy story and crazy movie anyway? The family of cannibals living away from the city, killing people out of their hammers, saws, axes, and then in the family eats them. But unless there is a sense to redo something? After all, such a plot is able to capture every nerve, even cold-blooded audience. Follow the fate of the five friends in this film is terrible to the very end. Of course, capture and other horror movies, with some even less, but the director's been possible. We know that the movie "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" was filmed without particularly large budget and quickly. Sometimes the actors had to endure the pain alive. Attention to Hooper's film, a large number of sequels and the cult of the film and is a direct confirmation of his genius. He deservedly stands in the forefront with "Psycho," "The Shining," "Jaws" and even in many ways superior to them. It should not pass any true lover tickle your psyche.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy and Very Disturbing!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is definitely a cult classic horror film that raised the stakes for 1970's horror films, but to me, it's not the best. In fact, I much prefer the 2003 remake. Franklin is very annoying. The music and the sounds used in the background at the farmhouse are scary. Sally, her brother, and their friends are driving to see if their grandpa's grave has been robbed, but it hasn't. They stop at a farmhouse and one by one, unknowingly enter Leatherface's domain. The Sawyer house is incredibly creepy and very detailed with bone ornaments and decapitated head lamps. The chase scene in the woods kinda dragged and went on forever. For most of the kills, Leatherface uses a sledgehammer. Only during the chase scenes is when he uses a chainsaw. Will Sally be able to outrun the psychotic Leatherface? If you love classic 70's horror, you might enjoy THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterclass in terror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1974, horror was in the middle of a rebirth following the success of The Exorcist the previous year. William Friedkin's supernatural horror was met with reviews claiming it as 'the scariest film of all time,' yet horror was still seen as a secondary genre, one in which smaller filmmakers could find their feet without risking a large budget and a studio's reputation. In 1974, Tobe Hooper, a director with only one film to his name in the form of 1969's Eggshells, travelled to Texas with $300,000 and a relatively unknown cast, comprised of mostly local actors, and constructed a film which managed to inspire terror in audiences around the world, despite featuring little to no gore. This was the true birth of the slasher, a film which built upon the foundations of Psycho while taking inspiration from it's antagonist (and real-life killer, Ed Gein) to create a character who's name is still known to this day, Leatherface. With no lines of actual dialogue and a limited screen time, Leatherface managed to carve his place in the history of horror and paved the way for films such as Halloween and Friday the 13th, which featured masked killers dispatching groups of teens. Wearing a mask made from human skin and a butcher's apron, the character is one of the most recognisable on screen figures within the genre and because of this, he's still around today, albeit in a slew of terrible remakes and one god-awful 'sequel', 2013's Texas Chainsaw 3D. Gunnar Hansen, the actor that portrayed the chainsaw wielding, mad-man so effectively, despite the character's lack of depth, recently passed away, leading to many heartwarming tributes from fans all around the world.It's not just the character of Leatherface that makes The Texas Chainsaw Massacre such a success as a horror film, however, but also the notion that such brutal, unrelenting killers could be hiding within the United States. Throughout the 70's, there were many violent crimes carried out by serial killers, but in 1974, Ted Bundy was only just beginning his wave of terror, John Wayne Gacey was still relatively unknown. With The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Hooper managed to terrify his audience by revealing what horrors may be awaiting them on the highways of America and in it's small communities which had been largely forgotten by the outside world. While The Exorcist may have had people praying for God to save their souls, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre had people wary of the reality they lived in, one which could be just as horrifying as the supernatural.In a filmmaking sense, the film is also shot beautifully, providing breathtaking images of the wilderness within central Texas. Each shot of the location where the film was made manages to capture the beauty that can be found within the rural parts of America, a clever technique that juxtaposes the brutal images that can be found in the film. Even more impressive is the house in which Leatherface and his family reside, adorned with the bones of small animals to create a 'house of horrors' which is terrifying due to the immense level of detail it holds. As characters discover different rooms within the house, it feels like we as an audience are intruding somewhere that we aren't welcome, stepping into the mind of a psychopath and witnessing their twisted thoughts coming to life before our eyes. Without a doubt, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is so successful as a horror film because of the images it presents to the audience inside the home of the cannibalistic family, images that it's hard to feel comfortable viewing.Perhaps the most impressive thing about The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, however, is it's ability to provide so much terror without ever resorting to copious amounts of gore. While the Saw franchise tried to fit in as much fake blood as possible across 7 films, Hooper held back on the amount of gore within his film in order to secure a PG rating from the MPAA. Of course, the finished product had no hope of achieving that rating due to it's content, yet it was still a wise decision by Hooper to avoid gore in favour of suggestion. When Leatherface lowers Pam onto a meathook in his kitchen, there's no blood squirting up the wall or over the masked killer, instead, Hooper cuts away from actual penetration, leaving Pam's agonising screams to provide the terror. This is a technique used throughout the film, cutting away from the actual moments of violence allowing the audience to fill in the blanks, and one that is extremely successful as our imaginations take over. We don't need to see a meathook pierce the spine of a teenage girl to know that such a thing is horrific, it's basic common sense and Hooper uses that knowledge and our ability to use our imaginations to garner scares, instead of opting for the bloodier option.As the film reaches it's climax and Sally manages to escape the clutches of Leatherface and his family, there final images will forever live on through the history of horror filmmaking. Standing in the middle of the road as the orange glow of the sunset blankets the shooting location, Leatherface desperately waves his chainsaw above his head in frustration as Sally rides away in a pick-up truck. It's an ending which should invoke feelings of happiness within viewers due to Sally's escape, yet it's chilling to see a young girl, covered in blood, laughing hysterically as she watches her would-be-killer disappear over the horizon. There's very little closure to Sally's story as we're left guessing what became of the sole survivor of Leatherface's brutal attack, however, the final images of her suggest that her life as a normal girl has come to end, the psychological effects of the film leading her to madness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the universally recognised shocking films in horror cinema and it has stunned audiences since its release in 1974. Upon release, TCM faced a total storm of outcry, censorship and controversy for its exploitative nature. It's a fiercely effective film that successfully manages to massively disturb viewers with them barely witnessing a single drop of blood. Using an unbelievable level of suspense, insane background music and psychological horror results in an atmospheric film that leaves a lasting impact of genuine fear and uneasiness upon whoever watches.The film tells a fairly simple tale - sweet natured Sally Hardesty, her wheelchair bound brother Franklin and their friends Pam, Kirk and Jerry take a road trip to rural Texas to investigate reports that have suggested grave-robbings have been occurring - so the group make a brief stop at her grandfather's grave to check it is still intact. Little do the five unsuspecting friends realise the real terror of what is hiding beyond the graves is a certain chainsaw- wielding, skin-wearing maniac and his deranged family. Marilyn Burns steals the show as our "final girl" and definitely gives it her absolute all to gain the scream queen title in what must have been an exhausting and traumatising role. Gunnar Hansen's exceptional portrayal of the iconic villain Leatherface offers glimpses behind the mask into the character's tortured and crazed soul.Despite the incredibly low budget of the film, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is certainly startling and impressive looking. Director Tobe Hooper clearly had a sharp eye for effective and breathtaking shots in such an early stage of his career. Extreme close up shots of Sally's petrified eyes help you understand her absolute terror in the most personal way. Hooper creates such an unbearable atmosphere and descends the viewer into the sheer madness of the situation - especially throughout the hypnotic climatic scene. The gritty cinematography is so effective and efficient - conveying perfectly the impending doom of the cast.Astonishingly, despite the gruesome title, there is very little blood spilled in the entire run time - probably making this one of the most misleading names of a horror film in history. Audiences will never see a meat hook impaling human skin, a hammer slamming against anyone's head, or even a chainsaw touching anyone's skin. The chainsaw itself mentioned in the title is only used once. The film relies on the viewer's ability to use their imagination and fills in the gaps themselves. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was refused a certificate for theatrical release and remained banned for a remarkable 25 years in the UK. In 1999 the film was finally given an 18 certificate which is rather interesting when you consider that the film is tremendously tame by today's standards, especially in terms of graphic content.The raw and grainy quality of the film topped with the striking production design gives it such a dirty realism that hasn't been matched in a horror film since. It completely immerses the viewer into the sheer filth and decay of the town. The heat of the blazing summer sun paired with the rotting stench of the town almost oozes through the screen. The soundtrack contributes massively to the film's overall tone of terror and insanity. The score is minimal and consists mostly of noisy, bizarre tones resembling metallic scrapes, screams and occasional percussion - showing proof of experimentation that speaks the language and evokes the atmosphere of the slaughterhouse and the state of mind of the demented family.Some modern filmmakers should go back to the roots of where it all begun and take note - cheap jump scares and buckets of blood is not entirely necessary to provoke genuine shock from your viewer. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a perfect example that heavily uses the reliance of suggestion and implication rather than off the wall and in your face gore to make the film all the more terrifying. This is an incredibly rare tactic and one that, even 40 years after release is still horrifying and shall continue to unnerve audiences for years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This horror classic, or just a masterpiece itself, is the reason chainsaws have the reputation they have today. Even though in the movie only one person is actually killed with a chainsaw. The unrelenting horror of the movie makes it seem like the chainsaw is the main part. Even if this movie was called, "The Texas Spoon Massacre" and involved a spoon. It will still be a masterpiece. It was scary in nineteen seventy four. And some scenes from the movie are still disturbing today.Who cares about the rewards this movie got? One win and one nomination? Critics reward to Tobe Hooper and in 2014 it won best selling DVD. It's two small rewards but this movie doesn't need rewards to be good. If you're in for a good slasher film. Have fun with this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm going to get right into it - this film is the GOLD STANDARD when it comes to creepy/freaky/scary movies, period. It is the best of it's kind and even after having seen it many times there are still scenes that I have to look away from (meat hooks anyone?). The way it's shot and the dialogue and the actors all come together to create a memorable movie experience. It's the most fun possible why having the hell scared out of you and not through tricks and gore but sheer terror (with a bit of the blackest humor thrown in too). Remakes don't come close. The fact is that it's precisely because of the limited budget that the film has the effect that it does. It's near impossible to duplicate this - when there's too much money thrown at a film it's going to show even whey people try to make it look "rough". The original is the real deal, folks, a genuine masterpiece.</fullReview>

The movie has a great Texas atmosphere, likable characters and very unpredictable script. There are many scary scenes(especially for 1974): Kirk and Pam's death, Jerry's death(one good jump-scare), Franklin's death(another good jump- scare and the most violent murder), the brutal chase scene and the psychological torture on Sally. As I said, the movie is awesome and very scary. I would liked to watch it in a theater in 1974. It would have been a great experience.</fullReview>

This movie has a lot of blood for the era, when Pam is murdered, i was so shocked, that scene was so intense, and the hammer of Leatherface, scares me. I think Franklin was the main character, but when he was killed, I feel bad, but Sally was good! she runs with heels without falling down, really intelligent, I have to say; Hitchhiker reminds me Tiger from Winnie The Pooh (laughs) jokes later, he is crazy a lot! my god, when he slash his hand I think that is the warning of the events in the movie, poor teens, and the horoscope of Pamwas a warning too! again, poor teens. Leatherface is so horrible, when I see the movie for first time, I feel horror, pure and deadly horror, Leatherface is one of the best villains in the cinematography! Thats why I give 8 stars for this movie, its really good, if you love the terror and don't watch this movie, WATCH IT NOW.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheap gore, exploitation in place of mood, feeling and anxiety.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to start. The villains are stupid idjit rednecks that I found to be annoying and harmless as kittens. The main character of the second half only has about ten lines in the first half, I didn't even know here name for the first 45 minutes. The only character that I cared about, the guy in the wheelchair, the only character where the filmmakers showed any subsidence is killed off so fast he may just have been a red shirt. I laughed out loud so many times during this movie, at how idiotic and silly that it seemed to me, that this is just not horror. It only gets scares from gore and revulsion. That is not good horror to me, that is a cheep out. Plus Leatherface, chasing a girl with a horrible ineffective weapon, that they show is horribly ineffective in the movie, for that matter. And another thing I could not get over about this movie is that when Leatherface is chain sawing this door (very slowly) that they showed less than a minute ago was unlocked. I know he is not bright, like a giant man child, but I assume he could try to open a door. The ending is absolutely, unbelievably a clusterfug. The entire soundtrack is just this girl screaming. Nothing truly scary, creepy or terrifying is happening, the idjit villains are just being idjits, and the noise is just unbearably loud. There is no complexity, no plot, nothing. They got a few simple scares in the beginning, very simple scares that directors and writers use only to get people to stay. During one scene the blonde, I forgot her name, Sam I think, is getting into a fight. She is obviously overpowered. There is no suspense, no nothing; just some bigger, stronger guy tying her up. He doesn't even hit her on the screen, and the sound the hits make is a very generic sound bit. The night chase scene is really where it disintegrated into a mess. For am I to be scared with an annoying as hell soundtrack, and a killer with no stealth and an ineffective weapon, plus a girl who I thought was only there to be a pretty face. When they literally introduce the villains in the beginning of the film she doesn't even talk. She does nothing, just has a but shot of her getting a Coke. The walkers in The Walking Dead (and I really don't like that show) are more scary than Leatherface. They show up out of nowhere with unnerving stealth at any time, and don't stop until disposed of, but Leatherface is a big, bumbling simpleton. I did not enjoy or like this movie, plain and simple. Horror should be about your fears. About the other among us (The Thing 1982), the very wrong and alien (Alien 1979), and good old unadulterated evil and sadism (Hellraiser 1987). This may have been original at its time, but in the end it is uncomplex, gory exploitation. No exploration of your feelings of anxiety or dread, just gore-porn. I have seen crap (Movie 43, I hate you), and this is not crap. So I give it a good four stars. Not one of the best, but not terrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>March 1st, 2014My first time watching this one all the way through, finally. I think this one differs from other exploitation movies of that age because of how well shot, acted and musically accompanied it was. The last half hour of the movie is a barrage of insanity. Dutch angles, double takes, claustrophobic close-ups. Asylum-worthy acting, bloodcurdling scream- queen shrieks. Camera bulb flashes, chainsaw whirring, tin cans rustling in the wind are what make up the soundtrack, a welcoming to the seemingly post-apocalyptic world, left behind by America, while so ironically encapsulated by it. Leatherface, the hitchhiker and the old man are trapped within the outside world, and when the outside world intrudes on their territory, they wreak havoc on it.I would also like to mention that while other exploitation movies often depicted the killer from a POV angle, TCM never does, and that's another aspect of this movie that makes it a(n ironical) deviation from exploitations.My friend has a copy of this on blu ray that I've been meaning to watch with her sometime, but for this viewing I opted to watch a VHS rip of it. I'll defend this because I feel the grainy-ness of the VHS only adds to the overall atmosphere of the movie. Like what Mark Borchardt said, it's akin to one of those videos which you'd see in a dingy science classroom back in grade school, and I agree. If I were you, I'd get this movie on VHS, or at least torrent a low-quality copy of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this was at the drive-in with my parents in the 70s, and it really freaked me out. But that was mostly because of the opening statement, which led me to believe it was based on a true story. But after a few nights of sleeping with my head under the covers, I realized how far-fetched it was toward the end. I heard things in the media to the effect that this was "based on Ed Gein" with no further details. So I looked it up and found that this story bears little resemblance to Ed Gein and is complete fiction. Knowing that, I rented the VHS in the 80s, and it really lost something. I experienced a similar phenom with Blair Witch Project--once you know it's fake, you feel like the cat who just figured out the laser pointer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>America's most dysfunctional family...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas chainsaw massacre is a classic of its own. a well built atmosphere, a nice arid place in the middle of nowhere to do the killings, and the best of it all: a great f*cking weird family. The film is scary, is fun, but mostly it can be dramatic when its asked. The terror starts slowly with the news, the odd guy, the lack of gas that would put them with no chance of escaping. It could be better? for me yes. i would like to see leatherface family more. I LOVED his dad criticizing him for what he done to the door. I loved the grandpa. The family was a great and unique mixing of terror and comedy. i think Texas chainsaw massacre is the best horror film to mix both genres. the problem is the lack of character depth in the victims, and also their dumbness in knocking at the devil's door so many times, one by one. OK there weren't many horror movies back then, and they didn't know what happened to their friends, although doesn't this sound a little far-fetched?overall a great horror film, that could be perfect if the leatherface family appeared sooner at the screen, and if some characters were smarter. Because the last 20 minutes are probably the best terror i've ever seen in a screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>great movie, i love how its always thrown in conversations with the greats like halloween and hellraiser and nightmare on elm street but sets itself apart from all the others because of its low budget nature. Its not your typical, glossed over Hollywood horror. Some of the characters were truly awesome while others were unfortunately garbage. The iconic leatherface is one of the scariest horror villains ever created, wearing other peoples skin as a mask, wielding a chainsaw, and apparently severely handicapped. Also the grandfather character was creepy as hell, barely having the strength to suck the blood from one of the victims fingers. Unfortunately none of the other characters back up these two freaks but luckily they are creepy enough to carry the movie. The hitchhiker was annoying but the scene of him cutting himself and the fat guy in the wheelchair is a scene that stuck with me long after watching the movie and was one of the only scenes i remembered before watching it again recently. Speaking of the fatty, he was also another character i hated, after watching the tcm documentary i was informed that this was intentional but i would have preferred to leave him out of it. Back to the good stuff though was the ending, loved the ending, the dinner scene leading to the outside chase with leatherface running with his iconic chainsaw while wearing a suit a tie has become one of my most favourite picturesque horror moments. Awesome horror, bring on the sequels!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A difficult film to sit through, nonetheless an achievement of independent film making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of young and unsuspecting friends are on their way to an excursion to the countryside sometime during the late sixties (or a concert maybe; the film does not provide the destination) with their mini-van. Things start to get weird when they pick up a hitchhiker who works in an animal slaughterhouse. Shortly after they run out of gas and stop at an idyllic Texan village to refuel and grab something to eat. It appears that the grandparent's house of a brother and a sister from the group is nearby and they decide to do some exploration of the surroundings. The others join in and the ordeal begins.This film has created a reputation as one of the most frightening (also raw and disgusting according to Roger Ebert) horror films. With clearly a meager budget, virtually unknown (but competent) actors and with an inspired direction by Tobe Hooper this film has stood the test of time and will continue to scare people for the years to come. When the credits fall and the film ends the ancient Greek word 'catharsis' comes to mind. 'Catharsis' means cleaning but in any horror film it translates better as cleansing of the 'soul' after witnessing events that test the body and spirit of an individual to the extremes.We are relieved for the life that escaped; it will have the chance to resume and create new life. In contrast the small Texan household of death is a place where time has frozen, a place that has literally become mummified and dies off being outside of life and not being able to create a new one.A difficult film to sit through but an achievement of independent film making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horrors from the 70's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a total absence of gore in this here horror film, yet it still is frightening. That alone makes it great. If you have a total lack of empathy or are just bored out of your mind you will probably see this as a repetitive chase with some wishy-washy sounds instead of a soundtrack.If, however, you are a sane person, and you realize what the makers of this film did with very limited resources and with the limited frame of reference, it's an excellent production. Something that still shines.The way in which basic fear of being lost, and being reduced to mere food or playthings is brought to life is astounding. Even for today. The element of survival is portrayed equally as vivid. Of course, this was already done before in Deliverance, but I don't think it was more concerned with adventure and revenge.I have to say, I haven't found a single slasher flick quite as enticing as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Even in all the stuff that came after 1974. Having said that, I didn't even dare watch the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic disturbing Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard that this movie had been banned in many countries outside the States due to it's raw depiction of torture and terror. Upon my viewing 9 years ago I could understand why censor boards in other countries had to adopt a harsh and strict attitude towards the movie. In this present day a movie such as this would not be considered violent or brutal at all due to many laws that have been amended and altered over the past few years. The average movie goers attitudes towards perceiving movies has changed considerably. This can be one reason for why many movies that are disturbing as this are released with only a few minor cuts.Tobe Hooper the director had managed to create a new trend in the horror genre which led to characters like Freddy Kruger and Micheal myers to come on screen. This is one of Hooper's best works to date. Despite the low budget he has managed to make a movie that cuts to the core of the movie watcher's mind. 'The Poltergeist' and 'The Mangler' I consider also to be movies of his that are worth watching too. Unfortunately Hooper's career has been left to nothing but producing franchise movies and giving rights to remakes. He had a lot of potential to sustain a good directing career.I had a terrifying experience the first time I watched the movie. The only other two movies that I feel would match up to the level as this would be 'The last house on the left' and 'The exorcist'. These movies too grind to the nerve. The frightening factor of TCM roots from continuous non stop screaming that the female character of Marilyn Burns evokes. Her display of terror and struggle was very convincing and contributes heavily towards making the movie a cult classic. If her acting was not so realistic maybe the movie would not have been so successful. The movie was shot in a grainy documentary style to give the viewer the feeling of realism. The low production value does not deter the movie from generating so much fear on a small scale. Special mention has to be given to the cinematography department. Many wide angle shots at a slow rate are a delight to watch. This helped to bring a feeling of suspense and was very stylish. The background score which is simple as can be, was suited to the relevant scenes helped create the correct atmosphere. My only complaint with the movie was the lack of face value. Casting some established actors would have made the movie enjoyable to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Non stopping trip into insanity and gore.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is it. Director Tobe Hooper deconstructs a road movie into a non stopping horror thriller and an absolutely must-see classic, taking the film experience to the next level. He manages to create a strong and savage atmosphere with a series of elements that converge perfectly. From the title and the opening sequence of flashes we know we are dealing with a movie not to be taken lightly. The viewer can't never help felling helpless for the characters and that is probably due to the fact that the script does not ever need to rely on the classic horror script type. Here the characters decisions are completely believable. After all, once they know they are in trouble they hardly make any. And here is the strongest side to this film. The anguish and tension will NEVER stop. Not for a second. In fact, the viewer will be expecting it to drop down a bit, as any other film. No. Tension is hardly matchable, for as long as there is image projected on the screen. Camera work is very effective finding the right angle and height to create a disturbing image. Art direction is flawless, delivering one of the most macabre sets ever made on film. It is true that this is a low budget production and may seem annoying if one's not use to the photography of the genre. Not to worry, most likely you'll get the code quickly and jump in to a real bizarre, macabre and thrilling ride that really pushes the edge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A low-budget horror masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I start to talk about my experience with this wonderful classic horror movie from director Tobe Hooper I'd like to apologize for any incorrect typing or grammar...I do come from Iceland....so...well anyways.. Let's cut to the real point!Nowadays (as everyone knows) whenever you look up for a good horror movie to watch, there's always blood, gore, violence, the same old routine with a couple of teenagers winding up to get killed in various of different ways (after all the sex of course) and really acting stupid when it comes to escaping...But this is something else! A wholly original movie that just comes out of nowhere and grabs your attention and never lets go until the very end that leaves you in a shock which believe me... stays for quite a while! In other words....this is what REAL horror movies are all about! OK first of all. Given the fact that this is a low-budget 70's movie (where apparently the special effects weren't nearly as good as now) I'd say that it is amazing just how the film manages to be so shocking and terrifying...some of the scenes are very tense and can grab your attention almost too well....(my favorite scene is with the hitch-hiker, done so perfectly by Edwin Neal) The actors do a pretty good job (most notable are Marilyn Burns ,truly believable screaming, Jim Siedow and Edwin Niel). The storyline grabs you easily into the heart of the movie, despite of being very simple, and the directing is really good...(The beautiful environments and color's of the landscape in Texas don't hurt either) In the end I hope that people who watch this film will accept it for what it is....A movie that is able to scare one without any big amount of blood, gore or special effectsNo wonder it's a cult classic! This is truly the one and only...THE Texas chainsaw massacre!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tobe Hooper had an idea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tobe Hooper, the writer and director of this movie, had an idea. It's only unfortunate that the idea wasn't big enough to fill an entire movie.Six people, two siblings and their friends, go to the grave of the siblings' parents. Before long, they're killed one by one by a family of cannibals, until only Sally (Marilyn Burns) remains. This takes approximately the first 20 minutes to do. So what's left? Well, Sally is captured, escapes, runs, screams, is captured again, etc. for the rest of the movie.The film is definitely disturbing and deserved its R rating, despite the lack of blood. It contains many closeups of Sally, distressed and/or screaming. It's never quite explained why they don't just kill Sally immediately like they did with the other five, but if they did, the movie would have been 20 minutes long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is surely interesting, and all actors have performed their part very well and with all the resources it had ? it was a sure formula for success!? But a big "NO" is the answer. The movie fails to connect and I felt as if I am viewing a sober re-make of 70-80's movie "Raj Tilak". This is a movie for all students studying Script writing and Director (in that order). It perfectly shows "What one should avoid" when writing a script and directing a movie. I am 100% sure that each and every scene and detail is well crafted out in the script ? word by word, image by image, page by page, and that is reflected on the screen.But the whole approach is immature ? coming from a veteran director. The characterization is poor, each scene is like a stand alone scene of enacted on stage, each single scene is stretched to unbearable limit of irritation, the music on the over-stretched scene is jarring, the sync sound is badly recorded, each dialogue is a pick-up from 60-70s pot boiler, and even with range of emotions given to the characters, all actors are under-utilized and wasted.A good movie on paper does not necessary result in a good movie on screen ? is the big, loud and clear message one gets after seeing this crap.Only saving grace of this movie is the cinematography. On the other hand, if you blindly follow Hollywood players, or believe that purely by eliminating songs and putting in gorgeous imagery you automatically transcend all flaws of the typical feelbad-flick and will get to watch a better film, then this one is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie last night, it started off very good. The first thirty minutes or so were great, and formed a classic intro for a horror movie. TCM takes the first thirty minutes or so, to create memorable, and individual characters. The beginning also has humor in it, which is very important, (if not essential) for a great horror film. Without humor horror movies can come across as too stark, in my opinion...This isn't just true for horror movies, but just about every genre. If a movie doesn't have any humor, you just start to think, Why so Serious? This was not the case with TCM though, the beginning of the movie was pretty funny, and realistic. The problem with this movie was, once the group of kids visited the grandfathers house, and all of them were kidnapped, the plot starting falling apart. I've noticed that this is a typical problem in slasher films. Like, its good for a slasher film to have memorable characters, but they are always killed off early in the movie. At this point the plot is between the protagonist, and the crazy killer. This killer often is a very silent one. So, what you have towards the end of the general slasher movie is long, drawn out scenes of the killer chasing the victim, with the victim screaming at the top of her lungs, helplessly.Now, these scenes can be very good, if they are filmed well, and/or are scary. But for some reason, the scenes in Chainsaw were not that scary, especially the chase scenes. There were a few moderately scary scenes (i.e. the kids going into the deserted house), though these could have been a lot scarier if they had used more of a suspenseful soundtrack. (This may not be essential in the chase scenes actually, as the wailing of the chainsaw is not only intimidating enough, though I don't believe any music could be heard over it) Overall, I thought TCM was a important but somewhat marginal horror film. The movie was influential to the developing of the slasher genre. I had wanted to see it for a long time. But I'm still glad I saw it. The movie actually functioned very well until the last 30 minutes. (The Dinner scenes, and the Gas Station scenes) At the point of this part of the movie, it had lost nearly all of its appeal. These scenes were also incredibly weird, and didn't mix well with the rest of the movie. The scenes toward the end were supposed to be terrifying I guess but they were really dated. The last five or so minutes were very good though. It has some great scenes, and is entertaining, but is overall a little disappointing. But slasher fans might like it. I'm not a huge fan of the slasher genre, as a whole, but there are a couple of them I enjoyed. (I really liked Psycho, and loved Halloween)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tobe Hooper + a camera = Atmosphere, tension and horror at its purest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just from observing the title, you'd expect Texas Chainsaw Massacre to be a hoot 'n' a holler of violence, an orgy of blood and guts; it's violent all right, except that it is done in a manner somewhat, as considered nowadays, unorthodox. Who needs detailed, close-up shots of man's internal organs spilling out like rice from a hole in a sack when you have the marvellous talent of Tobe Hooper? His craft makes TCM (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) one of the most brilliant and atmospheric films of any genre, never mind horror.The title pretty much sums up what to expect in the ensuing 80 minutes. An innocent, young group of people are caught up in bloodbath in the hot, dry and deserted back-lands of Texas. It is a simple premise, and it works well for what the film is. The characters themselves are much like the story, simple and straight-forward; there's no real depth to their personalities, but that is not entirely a bad-thing for director Hooper is more concerned with the film's depiction of horror, and the tension and atmosphere developed by this.As one may have been able to tell, it is the function and construction of horror which makes this film the classic that it is. The atmosphere and tension of the film makes your heart pound like it were begging for mercy to be released from your chest. The look of the film gives it a raw feeling, something unkempt, and dirty, like it were itself a rotting limb from one of Leatherface's several victims. Tobe Hooper's choice of setting, a farm house in the middle of a deserted Texas, adds a sense of isolation and helplessness; filming particular scenes in the dark also add to this effect as well as a sense of nowhere-to-run. The corroded, dry roar of Leatherface's chainsaw as an alternative to music builds the tension up fantastically; the louder the roar as it approaches any innocent individual, the more nails you bite. Chase scenes, in particular, feel never-ending; you simply want the hunted to escape somehow, and this adds loads more tension to what is already a very scary film. One aspect of Tobe Hooper's depiction of horror that is so wonderful is that he doesn't rely in any way on explicit gore, something which is common to most horror films, even the best of them.Tobe Hooper's achievement with Texas Chainsaw Massacre has been unrivalled to this day in terms of pure atmosphere and tension. Never has a film succeeded so well in keeping the audience on the edge of their seats feeling no other emotion other than anxiety for 80 straight minutes. And in my opinion, it is arguable to suggest that this is one of the best directed films in cinema history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At the pinnacle of horror, a masterpiece of cinema as well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the rest of the world, at the dawn of a presidential change, Texas will certainly always symbolize the conservative and reactionary side of the USA. Yet, Tobe Hooper was intelligent enough not to put fascist stereotypes in it like the sheriff in the 2003 remake. Instead, he preferred to stress down on a group of working class dead-beat, that is probably one key to the critical success of the film , a horror film in the service of social issues, a horror film paying attention to the dark side of the American dream. Cannibalism may, in this line of thought, be interpreted as a means of survival, who knows, maybe it could become ours providing the economic cataclysm keeps on growing ! "When savage capitalism brings savage measures" could have been TCM's aka. "Texas", this indication of place reveals its importance when compared, for example, with its French translation ; simply "Chainsaw Massacre". Indeed, the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is evocative of a crime file, which it is in the film, and maybe is actually, considering Ed Gein really did exist. Whereas the "Chainsaw Massacre" in French only suggests a cheap horror film, which it definitely isn't. That is why, I think, the film still suffers from a bad reputation to non-horror fans. They would probably think of it as a good film in general if they had the will to overcome this botchy translation deterrent. Another thing disturbs me when hearing non fans not even wanting to watch or even know it, they all know about Hitchcock and Psycho, but are not even aware of the same source of inspiration. Hitchcock earned his reputation as a renowned director. Tobe Hooper, well, can you know him when your're not a movie-buff yourself ? What would make the history of Norman Bates and his stuffed mother more sacred than that of a poor Texan family feeding on a bunch of rich youths ? In 1995, I was 16 when I first discovered TCM on French television after two decades of censorship. I had seen all of the series of slasher films, but none of them had given me a single true moment of cinema as TCM, quite an impression at a time I was no longer particularly craving for visual sensations. A few years later, I discovered Wes Craven's The Last House on the Left, but even if they contain the same share of realism and classes struggle (plus the presence of a chainsaw), I still don't get to like it. My interest in other horror films has vanished over the years, not in TCM. Maybe because this picture is not only about a killer with a gimmick and an ugly face, maybe it is because it is one of the most constructed of its kind, formally (the documentary point of view) and analytically (the social implications).Simply a masterpiece, fashion and time-proof.</fullReview>

The plot for this film is basically four teens are heading to a certain house to explore and while there two of the four go into another house over by the first and Kirk the gets hooked by Leatherface(Gunnar Hansen) then Pamela his girlfriend goes in to search for him and she too gets hooked by Leatherface. Sally and her brother Franklin who is a wheelchair bound guy and Jerry start to wonder where are Pamela and Kirk. Soon Jerry goes in the house to search for the two teens and Jerry finds Pamela barely alive and soon too is attacked and killed by Leatherface. Now with only Sally and Franklin left they both go looking for their friends when they discover horrors all around the house soon being chased by Leatherface outside the house. Sooner Franklin gets killed and Sally finds a gas station unknown to her that Leatherface's uncle(Jim Siedow) works there he soon knocks Sally out and takes her to the house. When she wakes up shes sitting at a dinner table with Drayton and Leatherface's brother the hitchhiker the guy Sally and her friends picked up on the way to the house. Drayton soon brings Grandpa down(John Dugan)where they tell grandpa to kill Sally by hitting her over the head with a hammer when this fails Sally finds a way out of the house where she is chased by Leatherface and the hitchhiker. She soon comes across a street where the hitchhiker is run over by a truck the truck driver offers to help Sally that is until he sees Leatherface Sally hops in quickly while Leatherface tries to chainsaw the door down soon he comes around the other side where Sally jumps out and climbs into an oncoming truck. As the truck drives away she laughs as if shes been driven insane by the whole ordeal while Leatherface angrily swings his chainsaw in the air. All in all TCM displays some awesome gore(for its time)and opened doors to a lot of directors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bona fide genre classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a bona fide genre classic, one of the most well-known horror movies EVER. A film that after 33 years still manages to give off that grim feeling of hopelessness and total terror. A film whose history is plagued with major censorship hassles (specifically during the mid-80s "video nasty" hysteria), mass walk-outs, and plenty of negative reviews by shocked and sickened critics. TCM is a film that reflects the bleakness of the era in which it was shot, which encompasses the aftermath of the Vietnam war and the Watergate scandal, a time of government oppression, racial conflict and revolution.The flimsy plot opens with a group of teenage friends, two of whom are brother and sister - Sally and the wheelchair-bound Franklin Hardesty - on a roadtrip in rural Texas, their purpose being that they are on their way to check on their Grandfathers grave after hearing reports of grave-robbing and vandalism at the cemetery where he's buried. When the group begin running low on gas, they pull over at a petrol station but the owner says there won't be any gas available till late afternoon. They decide to carry on up the road and wait at the deserted Hardesty family farm for fuel. While there a couple of the kids - Kirk and Pam, decide to go looking for an old swimming hole and in the process stumble upon a derelict farmhouse. Kirk, in the hope that the occupants may have some gas for sale, approaches the house and subsequently becomes the first victim of the homicidal, human skin-wearing, chainsaw-wielding Leatherface! From here on out the film is a basic slash / hack / chainsaw-fest, with all of the kids being eventually drawn to the house and killed off with the exception of Sally, who is treated to a rather eccentric family dinner, a round of hide 'n' go seek with Leatherface, then manages to eventually escape to freedom."TCM is a landmark horror pic that needs to be seen by any self-respecting horror fan" I think for me the thing that ultimately makes the film is Leatherface, he's an absolutely terrifying force of evil, whether he's caving in skulls with his sledgehammer or carving up some unlucky person up with his trusty chainsaw, he just manages to look so utterly deranged. A mindless beast who kills seemingly without reason, with his butchers apron and shrivelled mask of flesh gaudily painted up like a trashy hooker. He is the ultimate monster, far more realistic and horrifying than any Frankenstein or Dracula. One of my favourite images from the film is in the final scene where Leatherface does a crazed chainsaw dance with the rising sun for a backdrop.Despite TCM's reputation of being one of the most nasty and notorious horror films around, there really is very little blood and gore shown on screen. The film relies more on its grimy atmosphere, the gritty low-budget 70's feel and the documentary-style shooting all help add to the realism of a psychotic redneck family living in the backwoods of Texas digging up graves and cannibalising tourists. All this is added to by the fact that the family of psychopaths (specifically Leatherface) are based on serial killer Ed Gein - the family home is filled with furniture and morbid accessories made out of human bones, there are lampshades made from human skin, even Leatherface's infamous mask was once someone's face.Regardless of its horrific premise, TCM also has an undercurrent of black humour running through it too, as witnessed in such scenes as the "dinner party" where the withered, almost mummified figure of ol' Grandpaw feebly tries to brain Sally with a hammer or when the family taunt Sally by echoing her petrified screams back in her face.TCM is a landmark horror pic that needs to be seen by any self-respecting horror fan, it portrays an era of film-making that was raw, no-holds-barred and actually made an impact on you. This film has had an influence over genre cinema right up until today, it has been ripped off, "paid homage" to and referenced countless times by numerous directors (especially of late - Rob Zombie &amp; Eli Roth).Other classic products of 70's exploitation that are mandatory viewing: Last House on the Left, The Hills Have Eyes, I Spit on Your Grave and The Candy Snatchers.</fullReview>

The hitch-hiking brother is my favourite - he's almost more insane than our main maniac. I really love this film. Together with "The hills have eyes", "Suspiria" and "The Exorcist" - this is the way a horror should be made. You have to feel uneasy when you watch it, not scared, being scared is overrated. Ha-ha the Ben-hur of horror movies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TCM(short for Texas Chainsaw Massacre) is without a doubt one of the greatest and (together with "The LastHouse on the left" and "Halloween") influential horror films of all time. But horror isn't nearly enough to describe what's going on in this twisted tale of incestuous rednecks torturing young stoners in the sticky heat of Texas.------------------------------------------------ -Terror is quite appropriate i think. The film is downright nasty and gruesome in every way. It's gritty realism and innovative camera technique still fasciantes and shocks today. Tobe Hooper's film is atmospheric and you can feel the heat and dirt literally crawlin up on you. The influence of TCM can be felt even today(just look at Hoistel or High Tension for which i also wrote reviews). But be sure to get the uncut version cause TCM is downright dirty 70's terror cinema that every self respecting horror AND movie fan should have seen in its violent and sadistic entirety</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nail-biting experience, leaves you really sick and worried afterward.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most renowned horror movies ever to be made, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre will give you nightmares for a month, guaranteed! The premise is simple, the story to the point. Five teenagers make their way across Texas one summer day to check on the grave of their grandfather due to recent grave-robbing occurring in the area. Along the way they pick up a hitcher, who, crazed as he is, decides to cut the arm of one of the teens and bails out. Thinking this to be nothing they find themselves now at the abandoned childhood home of their family, which is where the horror begins. Out of gas, alone and scared, Leatherface finally makes his appearance on the one lone surviving hapless heroine. The chase which ensues is awesome, scary and pulse-pounding all the way to its climax.Given the simplicity of the budget the writers and director decided to instead focus on tension, suspense and visuals to aid in frightening the audience. Watching it now I can honestly say its one of the best movies ever made, and as such deserves to be a cult classic as long as movies play a part of our lives.From start to finish I was gripping my seat, near misses and everything else you could want in a horror film, and not that bad of a story line either.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's impressive just how foundational this film has been for later slasher flicks and later horror filmmakers in general. (Ridley Scott gave it props and cited it as an influence in the filming of *Alien*: now that's a feather in your hat!) Both of Rob Zombie's films, *House of 1000 Corpses* and *Devil's Rejects*, could arguably be considered direct homages to *TCM*. The similarities are interesting. The crazy family with the creepy grandfather and the huge, lumbering brother (Leatherface/Tiny) in the out-of-the-way dilapidated house decorated with creepy junk is half the setting and cast of *House of 1000 Corpses*. The other half of that cast is the group of young people on a road trip (one of whom is annoying (Franklin/Jerry)) who get themselves in trouble with said crazy family--though the latter part of this element might be traced even further back to *2000 Maniacs*. Characters wearing someone else's face on their own (Leatherface/Otis/Wendy) is a connection to both of Zombie's flicks, as is depicting someone getting nailed by a semi (the Hitchhiker/Wendy). Lastly, there's the creepy dinner scene in *House of 1000 Corpses* that is a direct homage to *TCM*. It's not just Zombie's films that have relied on Hooper's masterwork: elements from this film pop up in many later ones like *Motel Hell*, *Madman*, and *Friday the 13th* just to name the first few off the top of my head. This film, like *Last House on the Left*, does a terrific job of depicting the isolation that is only believable when set in the 70s and early 80s (and this is why I don't think the re-made *TCMs* can ever be successful; it's just no longer believable for characters to be cut off like that or for a family to live in such an isolated way that no one would figure out they're bumping off travelers. But to return from my little tangent, the whole film is creepy--from the moment they decide to pick up the crazy hitchhiker, to the now-classic scene of Kirk being smacked in the face and Leatherface slamming that metal door (Blaaagh! that still freaks me out), to the scene in which Sally runs upstairs into Grandpa's room (I've always wondered if mummified grandma was an homage to Psycho), to Grandpa sucking the blood off Sally's finger, to that dinner scene when they're all screaming along with Sally. It's all just wrong and messed up, confirming the sneaking suspicion everyone has that someone you'll run across in your life is so screwed up that they are operating by an entirely different set of rules than everyone else--rules that you won't understand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I kinda felt I needed to own TXCM because I admired heaps what it did for the horror genre and the fact it was made for virtually no money but still managed to scare the living sh*t out of me (i was like 10 when i first saw it...slept with the lights on that night let me tell you!) but the fact is i just cant bring myself to watch it again, it's sick not so much what you see but what is implied...plus the bad guy was just a retarded thug, not some supernatural thing like Freddy Kruger that was easy to dismiss as pure fantasy. This guy could have existed, could exist NOW, that's what makes it so d*mn freaky!Horror films these days (as with other genres) rely way too heavily on CGI to enhance the effects or "scariness" factor...but CGI effects date VERY quickly and VERY poorly...so there's NO WAY they'll ever stand the test of time the way TCM has...what i mean is, Tobe Hooper et al could never have taken a "soft option" and chosen CGI effects...they had to come up with ways to scare the beejesus out of people with just camera effects, performances and make up...hard to do...John Carpenter did it with Halloween, Hooper did it here.Thoroughly freaky movie...not "omg thats gross" but "omg that's the creepiest damn thing I ever saw!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the granddaddy of them all it kicks major ass. For me the most terrifying scene had to be where franklin and sally are looking for their friends and then good old Leatherface comes out and takes care of franklin with the chainsaw. another scene that got to me the first time I watched this was the hitchhiker cutting his hand up. I think the actors did a great job. Gunnar Hansen made a great leather face. Like I said once this is my favorite film of all time.t c m the Texas chain saw(1974). A few other things I like about this movie is. Its a solid horror film. Its 1970's horror which means down and nasty. The main thing I like about this movie is that it is hardcore and hard hitting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is an incredible film, and the first of its type. It is beautifully shot and has surprisingly good acting, and the dark theme of the whole movie make it very tensional and disturbing. Simple but powerful special effects add to the movies eerie feel, including the background music. Despite the movie being notorious for being gory, there is actually almost no gore, and only one person is killed with a chainsaw but nothing is actually shown, leaving it to the imagination, another thing which makes this such a haunting film.Overall I'd give this movie a 10 because it truly deserves it. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre started off a whole new genre, one that most unfortunately Hollywood decided to take over and use over and over again, filling it with their usual cheap jump scenes and countless crappy sequels and remakes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well lets see, let me just put it this way: i never thought that this film would be so amazingly scary and strange. When I saw that the film got 5 stars in the Radiotimes I only thought that the acting was the great bit. Sure the acting was awesome but the real reason it got five stars is because it does the job of scaring the the hell out of you well...VERY WELL!! It may not be the average film length but who cares?? It scares you like hell, that is what was supposed to do and deserves a lot of credit.Another reason why it's awesome: it inspired Hooper to create a sequel and another one after that (not by Hooper), I haven't seen them, they look crap! It also inspired directors like Jonathan Demme to think of Silence of the Lambs-the guy wears peoples skin. It also inspired the creating of games including Resident Evil 4, name another game with a chainsaw wielding psychopath trying to kill you? You will be mentally scared by this film!...Unless you are really weird in the head, which you will be after seeing this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The pornography of terror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The bad news is The Texas Chain Saw Massacre has a plot that is completely unoriginal and has undeveloped characters. The good news is that it doesn't need these things to work.Plot? - A group of teenagers are driving to an old house in the country that belongs to one of their fathers, terror ensues.Why does The Texas Chain Saw Massacre work, where so many others have failed?The Texas Chain Saw Massacre does not barrage you with dull chit chat between idiotic characters and pitiful attempts at comedy in between gory murders for one. The execution of the film is the key to its success - A slow build up before the carnage, weird camera angles, macabre set designs, spooky, realistic cinematography, a genuine masterclass in film editing and a bizarre, down-right effective soundtrack. It is these elements that separate The Texas Chain Saw Massacre from it's imitators creating an onslaught of unrelenting, fear inducing images and sounds.Another reason why for myself in particular, 32 years after the film was made, is the fact that it is a 32 year old film. With modern horror movies, it is easy to disassociate from the on screen characters, usually down to too stylised cinematography and improved production techniques. With the older films, grainer and less stylised, the realism is enhanced, and thus easier to believe.On the film's release in the UK, the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) banned it citing "The pornography of terror." I agree with that statement whole-heartedly, as after a little rummaging around, it builds to a climax and when it's over you will feel drained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre:The Doc's Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a flawed cheesy classic.This film was meant to be terrifying in the 1970's however in this day and age the film is more funny than scary and unfortunately time and age become an issue.People will consider me ignorant when i say age contributes to a films flaws but it's true.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre intended to be scary and disturbing and in 1974 that may have been the case but in 2006 it isn't therefore the film fails to deliver what it was made to do,it doesn't mean it's a bad movie it just means it won't have the same effect it had on adolescents of 2006 that it had on adolescents of 1974.in 1974 I'm sure what was scary in the 1950's (The Creature From The Black Lagoon,The Mummy) weren't scary to young people in 1974,it doesn't mean those were bad films it just meant the new generation didn't find them SCARY.This film is very original at a time when good slashers dominated the horror genre and for that this film is marvelous but as a part of the new generation i unfortunately see flaws that may not have been flaws in 1974.The one character in his mid twenties gets angry at his friends and blows raspberries as a sign of his anger.Who does that nowadays except for six year old?a flaw that takes away from the realism however in 1974 that may not have been an issue.Leatherface looks like a mentally challenged drag queen, I cannot take him seriously as a killer when he is dressed in a bright coloured apron.The kills are way too close together, four of them get offed one after the other leaving us with 40 minutes of the family pursuing one victim.There is a paper thin story as we now nothing about the characters so why do we care???The film doesn't get good until the chase scene and the acting from then on is top notch.The fifth victim is a fantastic actress who brings realism back to the film.She screams for the duration of the last 20 minutes of the film and tough guys can claim they'd be calm in this situation but that is sheer crap.This movie is an instant classic that gave birth to a horror icon and while todays audience may not see it as scary it's still a fantastic and original film that deserves praise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Stuff of Nightmares.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made more than three decades ago there was uproar when Texas Chain Saw Massacre was released to an unwitting public and brazenly re-wrote horror movie clichés as we know them.Where it wasn't severely cut, it was banned and for the do-gooding moral crusaders who fought against its vulgar corruption of decency and ethical-boundary pushing, their plan backfired, making Texas Chain Saw Massacre one of the most infamous, sought-after and well acclaimed horror films of all time. Still as unsettling today as I'm sure it was back in 1973, Texas Chain Saw Massacre's brilliantly original plot still shines just as boldly, brazenly and bloody as ever. Chain Saw Massacre single-handedly changed horror for a generation, and I can safely say that there's not one film out there that hasn't be influenced by Tobe Hooper's shoe-string masterpiece. It's surprising to know that it was started for little over $60,000 - a task which would be impossible to accomplish in this day and age. This low budget classic has a true gritty quality to it, it's presumably unintentionally grainy filming and shaky camera work, just adds to the white-knuckle tension and its pretty basic sets are perfectly suited to what this film is all about. As most will know this film follows a group of young kids on their way to visit their grandfather's grave. They soon run in to trouble when they pick up a deranged hitchhiker, played awesomely by Edwin Neal and consequently stumble across the original House of 1000 Corpses. What follows it sure to be a delight to any true horror fan and is certainly the stuff of nightmares. The fantastic Gunnar Hansen is superbly suited to the role of Leatherface, and a truly terrifying villain. He's no Freddie Krueger who gets up after being killed, he's a real guy with a real determination and his relentlessness is what makes the film so horrifying. Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a brilliant visual feast of all that is right about the horror genre, but perhaps more famously remembered for its audio gross-outs. No doubt the most 'gore-free' horror film which cleverly has you thinking you've just witnessed a bloodbath of flesh and guts. In fact you see barely any blood, but it's fantastic sound FX, just go to show how sound can trigger that all uncomfortable memory deep within you. Which is always more terrifying than anything seen on screen. Also, ultimate praise for possibly the most awkward dinner scene ever put onto film and for its truly unique and brilliant characters that were invented before they became your staple horror movie cast. All in all, Texas Chain Saw Massacre is still the undisputed King of all that is Sick and Disturbing; a little gem that still shines thirty years after is unintentionally well-publicised release and a well renowned story-line that radiates originality, terror and stunning balls-out fear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think of this flick as a propaganda piece on par with "Triumph of the Will", this time for vegetarians. To me, the slaughterhouse conversation had in the van with the hitchhiker essentially sets the 'moral' ground for all of the following action. That said, TCM literally took my breath away. The setting is so terrifyingly insular and the antagonists so matter-of-fact in their evil doings that you can't help but feel suffocated. There is enough comic relief, too, to keep us afloat in a sea of mindless sadism. In fact, despite the warnings, TCM is not gratuitous. It is simply horrifying. I highly recommend this flick for anyone with a heart for terror.</fullReview>

I can remember when I rented this movie about 15years from now, because Spielberg blows about Tobe Hooper on the VHS cover that he is a genius. He's right. Hooper is a genius. He can create such original, one and only EVIL atmosphere. No one can do exactly the same as Hooper. By the way, I think every people will start considering small things about any Movie which you've been watched a lot. Me, about Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I am considering these days that I guess Sally, Franklin and Leather Face brothers must be a neighbor and must be knew each other once even if they are forgotten, because they are living so close.

		<shortDescription>A raw stomach-churning masterpiece, still arguably the most unsettling film ever made! At least better than House Of Wax!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the type of masterpiece that modern films, horror and otherwise, struggle to live up to. The film creates a tone that is at times darkly comic as well as a creepy sense of inevitable terror from the very early scenes of grave-robbing, which are reminiscent of the unsettling open graveyard scene from George A. Romeros' Night Of The Living Dead. However there is something abut Hoopers' film that truly gets under the skin in the way many other films have achieved only fleetingly or generally not at all. One film that owes a great deal to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is The Silence Of The Lambs, in particular the scene where the kidnapped girl, Cathreine Martin sees the remains of a previous victims' fingernails on the wall of the well where they had probably tried to escape. Indeed both films are known to be influenced by real life serial killer Ed Gein and perhaps it is because of the fact that they are based on something as horrifying yet factual as those events which enables both films with the power to unsettle. In relation to Chainsaw, the barely adequate remake fails to capture the wonderfully sickening tone of the original which seemed to be able almost to make you smell the abattoir that the characters smell and really put you in there with them, making the violence which ensues all the more shocking. The lack of any musical score is also effective in creating a sense of reality, in contrast to the (excellent) music in John Carpenters' Halloween which though it is a great film, you never get the feeling that it is anything more than a film. With The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, thanks in part to the final image of 'Leatherface' waving the titular weapon against the backdrop of the Texas sun, there is no sense of closure. We are reminded that events as gruesome as those in the film do and will continue to happen and that out there somewhere in the realm of cinema, that family is still alive, doing what they do. This is a much more terrifying thought if it is left in the viewers' mind, without any consideration given to the rubbish sequels and vastly inferior remake.</fullReview>

There are some really great ones out there - Seven Samuri, Gone with the Wind etc. But in the vane of horror films, it ranks with the best. These kids, like most, were out for some fun; being in college in the 60's the old van fit the bill. Gunnar Hansen was all too believable as 'Leather face'. The sets, the stark fear, the madness, the insanity, the fact that it looks like it was made with a home video camera makes it look almost like a documentary. If you like this kind of stuff, see it and deal with a few sleepless nights. Do not decide to see it out of pure curiosity or you may very well be sorry you did!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some movies where, if you're a fan of the genre, you'll enjoy it, and if you're not, it will just really disturb you. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is one of those movies.For some reason, I decided to watch this movie at midnight. It has been a month and a half since I saw it, and it still remains one of the most sickening, disturbing, shocking, terrifying movies I have ever seen. Put simply: it did everything it was supposed to. It was violent without being graphic. The music (if you could call it that) has nudged out the Halloween theme as my most terrifying movie score (sorry, John). Leatherface is one of the most horrific antagonists I've ever seen in a movie (and I've seen The Thing and The Evil Dead). Quite simply, as a horror film, this one works. With stuff like The Toolbox Murders, The Mangler, and Crocodile under his belt, Tobe Hooper should be grateful to this movie for making him more than a horror footnote.All right, I've conquered TCM.

What makes this film so scary is the family is sick (and I mean disgusting) and if you just imagine yourself in Sally's positions you really can see the terror.

		<shortDescription>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: sheer horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether you are seeing it for the first time or re-watching it for the million time, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is bound to leave a mark. What is it that makes this movie such an important landmark in horror? As far as I see it, it is the depth of the lunacy and mindlessness that not only justifies the characters' actions as forms the driving force of the movie itself. Although it is true that it a quality of most horror movies to portray the illogic and the unexplainable, be it supernatural or not, the victims of the movie are informed of what happened to them, even if this revelation only comes to the few surviving character(s), it does come, eventually. And this reassures the public, to a degree. Due to its unique feeling of absolute confusion, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre deviates from this rule.We never get to know why Leatherface and his family act the way they do. The only explanation is insanity, but that doesn't apply to the characters themselves, it permeates the movie itself. First of all the pace is so insane that Sally never has the chance to reflect on what is happening to her, nor do any of the other characters. Taking into consideration that the movie unrolls its action over a period of a few days, and that the climax takes only a day, there is no time for the characters to wonder what is happening to them. In most horror movies, even the great ones, the characters will have time to wonder and question. It is almost taken that the people in horror movies try to rationalize whatever horror they find themselves a prey to, by making questions. There is no time for such a thing in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. As soon as Leatherface appears in scene, logic shatters and there it is simply impossible to pause and wonder. Sally has to run right away, and as soon as she starts running, she doesn't stop until the very end. Not only does the threat of violence and imminent death force her to relinquish her mental faculties, as the frantic pace completely robs her of her ability to reason. Thus, Sally is truly dragged into the insanity of the twisted family since she begins to share the insanity that binds them together.The fact that the screaming is almost constant punctuates the movie with true despair. Another aspect that makes this movie what it is, is the main character that is repeatedly battered, captured, and that cannot find aid. Her prospects are demolished, she is captured but manages to survive, her commitment to survival is praise-worthy. There is a tradition of girls pushed to the edge of their coping abilities, but this torment is rarely witnessed in such an intimate way as it is with Sally. There is nothing to distract us from her plight, no secondary plot lines to leave us waiting for the conclusion to carry its course, we follow her desperate efforts to escape, and can witness the hysteria that takes over her. Another thing to be taken into consideration is the border between Supernatural Horror and Realistic Horror that in this movie is blurred. The character of the grandfather of the lunatic family is dead but not quite. To decide whether he is something like a zombie is up to the viewer. And despite the pace, we have time to see the torture Sally undergoes at the hands of the lunatics. Sally's panic, whether she is trying to flee or pleading for mercy, is absolute. And that is another important aspect: the destruction of the surviving character, in life. In few cases has shock and hysteria been taken to such an extreme. The physical strain and the psychological damage reduce Sally to a wreck, which is another aspect that makes this movie such a killer: she does survive, in the end, but one can clearly see that she will never be the same again. In this case, redress is not fully obtained, Sally's crazy laughter as the car drives her away from her terrible tormentors clearly shows that she now shares part Leatherface and co's insanity, it is even reminiscent of hitchhiker's constant grin. Although significantly different, Sally's lunacy is bound to scar her for life. Which is something at which many horror movies hint at but is hardly ever so palpable: the scars that such a horrifying experience inflict on the survivors. In a sense, Sally does die, for she becomes someone else, from a complete human being she is reduced to a victim, a terrified and nearly insane version of the Sally we met in the beginning. yet, in a way, she is also stronger, a paradox that depends on the viewer's analysis of the movie. As for Leatherface himself, he is not punished or even greatly wounded. He doesn't die nor does he disappear, he remains. This villain that is not removed from the world and persists to stand, makes Sally's escape a relative one. So what is it that makes the Texas Chainsaw Horror so terrifying? Knowing that the powers of insanity are a force to be reckoned with, that they cannot be explained and capable to turning one's world into a nightmare of confusion and chaos. The overall darkness of the movie, its violence, both graphic and hinted at, the sheer screams that follow the action like a shadow follows its owner, the detailed morbidity of the artifacts crafted out of human bone, its gritty aspect and complete madness make it an hymn to the abnormal and gruesome. It offers a share of absurd mayhem and chaotic suffering as only a good horror movie can deliver.</fullReview>

Tobe Hooper did a super job directing the movie and the cast made the movie great also. The late Jim Siedow as Drayton Sawyer, Edwin Neal as the Hitchhiker, and Gunnar Hanson as Leatherface. The movie and the character "Leatherface" is based on the real life serial killer Ed Gein.Five teenagers are on a drive in Texas, they stop at a graveyard cause they heard some graves have been dug up. Sally Hardesty and her invalid brother, Franklin,have a grandfather buried there and wanted to see if he was dug up, but he was not. They and their friends are driving and pick up a hitchhiker, who was the grave robber, they thought he was alright till he cuts himself, than cuts Franklin, they get rid of him.They get to a gas station, but they don't have any gas,Drayton Sawyer,is the owner of the gas station told the kids the transport won't be her till later on. The teens are on their way to Sally and Frankin's old house. They arrive and have a little fun. Kirk and Pam want to go swimming, they go to a creek,and the creek is dried up. They see a farm house and think they could get some gas from them. Kirk and Pam go to the house. Kirk knocks on the door, and hears a noise, he walks in the house and Leatherface hits him over the head with a little sledgehammer, and drags Kirk's body in the kitchen. Pam is waiting outside and decides to go in and see why Kirk is taking too long, so goes in and goes in a room to see some horrid things, a live chicken in a cage, bones, skeletons everywhere. Pam is horrified and tries to run out of the house and Leatherface catches her and takes her into the kitchen and is hung on a meat hook. Leatherface takes out a chainsaw and begins cutting up Kirk.Jerry goes to look for Kirk and Pam and sees the farm, he goes there, up to the door. Jerry thinks that Kirk and Pam are goofing around, he goes in the house and into the kitchen and hears a noise. The cooler in the kitchen is opened up by Jerry and sees the body of Pam. Leatherface hits Jerry on the head with the hammer and kills him.Later that night, Sally and Frankiln go to look for Jerry, Kirk, and Pam, they run into Leatherface and he kills Franklin with the chainsaw and chases Sally to the farm house and she gets to the gas station only to find Drayton, he gets his truck and ends up tying Sally up and takes her to the house. Sally's night is filled with terror, will she make it out alive, or will she end up like her brother and friends? This movie really does show the terror out there.In the beginning of the movie, the narrator was John Laroquette, who is well known for his roll in the 1980's TV series "Night Court".I give this movie 2 thumbs up and 4 for gore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never have i seen a film that builds up such an incredible atmosphere and such a chilling finale that scares the socks off 'audition'. TCM is the most eerie, creepy and chilling film ever made! That scene where we first meet Leatherface as he batters Kirk with a hammer, the way it is shot, the way he drags Kirks body up the step and slams the door in our face violently. The way Leatherface grunts and gnaws like a pig. Any horror freak should have already seen this and if you haven't then you're not a horror freak, you're just a freak! The film is about a group of five teenagers who go to spend a week or two in an abandoned house owned by one of the group(the eldest one in a wheelchair)'s father. They are not prepared for the macabre, sadism of the family of cannibals (Leatherface,the Hitch-hiker,the Cook,Grandpa) awaiting them. The screaming finale is so realistic it makes you worry. Don't be a fool and pick up the remake as it is an insult to Tobe Hooper. 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greates Horror Film I Have Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw this movie for the first time and this is the greatest horror movie ever made. Tobe Hopper's direction is fantastic and the acting is great. The fact the movie takes place in the middle of nowhere in Texas just adds to the horror of it. """WARNING""" SPOILERS AHEAD. The one thing that I didn't like was that franklin the brother had to die. He was in a freaking wheelchair for Christ sake. This movie has everything, gore, screams, and crazing cannibalistic Texas thats worth an hour and 23 minutes of your time. please if you haven't seen it go out and rent like i did. you'll be glad you did. I rate this movie 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Horrific Cinematic Experience of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all the cheesy slasher movies Hollywood has cranked out over the last twenty or so years, it's easy for the masses to forget a certain gem of terror that was unleashed upon the world in 1974. A brutal, gritty, unrelenting masterpiece that spawned the genre. A film that remains the most horrifying cinematic experience ever made to this day. A film known as "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre".The film begins with a sequence of brief, unsettling images of a decomposing corpse while a distant, ghostly voice informs us that someone has been making a macabre form of "art" out of long-buried human bodies. We are then introduced to a group of happy-go-lucky teens on their way to a remote, run-down mansion. On their way, they pick up a hitchhiker, who, after a rather awkward conversation, proceeds to cut himself and one of the teens. The teens quickly throw him out of their van and continue on their way. Once at the mansion, two of the teens begin to explore out back. They come across a house. And with the quick smack of a hammer to a forehead, the film turns into a non-stop ride of murder, dismemberment, cannibalism, and every form of horror you can imagine.Unlike the sleek, glossy "horror" films of today, "Massacre" has a gritty documentary feel to it, which just adds to the realism of the terror all the more. Another thing "Massacre" does differently than most horror films is how it approaches the violence. Throughout the film, you don't actually see a large amount of it. Don't get me wrong, this film contains some of most horrific, disturbingly violent content ever conveyed through cinema, but the fact that most of it occurs just off camera gives the film something of a surreal feeling, reminiscent of "Psycho".From the eerie opening to the rip-roaring last frame, "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is an experience unlike any other. It may not be pleasant, I'm not even sure if you could call it entertaining, but it is undeniably horrific and it is something everyone should experience at least once in their lives, whether they like it or not.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is simply put THE masterpiece of horror, and naturally one feels quite the bit of reverence when about to review it. Many films have tried to emulate it, to follow it in it's wonderfully psychotic and rotten footsteps(most notably the absolute shitty, completely unnecessary and melodramatic Follywood-remake.),but alas,none has even come close. From the very first frame one knows one is in for quite the special ride; a black frame, the sound of shovel, the occasional blink of light revealing part by part dead flesh. Poor Pam finding herself in the midst of necrotic, bone-hell, gasping in a state of shock, for her sanity and the slightest bit of fresh air, in a place where Death has taken residence. Her boyfriend looking for the friendly face, instead encountering the blow of the sledgehammer, now lying there bleeding like a pig in death-spasms. Pam again, forced to caress the hook, and being stored in a meat-locker for later consumption. Sally being chased by the charming Leatherface, thinking that finally help is at hand when she runs into a gas-station, only to find herself properly bound and gagged, like some hog or fowl. Sally is invited to (become)dinner at the mansion, and you just know that torture has gotten a new name. The atmosphere in this masterpiece is so sinister, so full of filth and death, so absolutely twisted and eerie, and features such an excellent, psychotic and minimalistic soundtrack, that not one single horror film could ever be able to top it. The most brutal experience you will ever have, period, and to think that from the outset Mr Hooper was intentionally going for a PG-certificate! And the result being that several people actually vomited on first viewing, thinking that they had seen much more than was actually shown on screen!! Now if that isn't a stroke of pure genius, if that is not the divine spirit of genuine artistry, then tell me, tell me:WHAT IS?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all of you kids that thought the version of TCM that you saw in theatres a couple of years ago was scary because the killer's face rotted off, consider this. In the original film, his face wasn't falling off...and he STILL KILLED PEOPLE. What caused him to snap? How do I know?!? I don't CARE, he's killing people because he wants to wear their frickin' SKIN! Turn all the lights out and watch this by yerself. If you don't find it the slightest bit unnerving, go back to watching 'Faces of Death' and worshipping Satan or whatever it is you do in your free time. 9 OUT OF 10 P.S. After the 30th time I've seen this I don't find it much scary anymore, but I'll tell you this...Leatherface is the scariest 'idiot' next to Jason Voorhees. And please don't watch this on LSD. You'll see pentagrams that aren't really there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Cut right through me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a cult classic and one of the best "inspired by a true story" movies ever, because you have to look at it closely. in the early 70's five teenagers were killed in Texas, by a deformed child like man named "Leatherface" along with his sick and disturbed family. When the teens are introduced in the van, their are two females and three males, and one of the males is in a wheelchair, now in real life imagine what these teens when through, especially the teen in the wheelchair, being hacked to death by a chainsaw "very painful as you can tell" and discovering they aren't the only victims as the film comes to an end. you have to feel sorry for them, even though they are "your typical teens" this film touched me because every time something happened in the movie, i kept thinking what really happened to them in real life! and when something did happen it saw shocking. On the remake's website of the Texas chainsaw massacre it makes you want to cry in a way. www.texaschainsawmovie.com check it out, it will give you an idea of what happened! But these two similar stories are a excellent idea of what happened, and the movies both original and remake are classics!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...does have its charm...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once upon a time there was a poorly skilled director and his hot chicks and 70's boys. There was also a huge, fat guy who wanted weird teeth, a chainsaw and a leather mask on his face. And the world of cinema would never be the same...THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE starts of pretty slow, with the main characters babbling stupidly, but ends with a outrageously gross, yet, kind of charming, family dinner. MASSACRE was, at the time of its release, so violent and awful for the audience, Swedish government wanted not only to completely ban the movie, but the whole video system! Nowadays, it may not seem so bad, but it still is gross, has a sick sense of humor buried in it, and rather nice main characters (Leatherface the retarded maniac, his father, the insane gas station owner, his crazy brother, and their much-earlier-dead grandpa). The dinner scene toward the end is the one you should look forward to, although this movie would be so much better without the annoying Sally screaming all the time.Watch this movie if you want to kill(pun intended) time, it is definitely worth it. No masterpiece, though. But lives up to its hype far better than Dawn of the Dead (1989) did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true Horror classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When watching this movie, one should bear in mind this is a classic. We are speaking 1974 or something, come on! the fact you have seen it all before, is because other movies are made after this one and LIKE this one, because it's that good. This is horror as it should be. Suspense, murder and nasty details. The sound effects are killing you, as it should be.In a time when special effects were not available as they are today, this is a outstanding peace of work. The characters all differ, like Scooby Doo or something, which makes it all interesting. The main character is a very good actress. One would think she was really afraid and confused when shooting the movie. And that masked murderer is just plain sick. He has a brother who also adds a great deal to the movie, but not too much. Everything is right as it should be, and that's what it's all about to make a great movie.If you think you like horror, you MUST see this one. If not for the movie (which is great), then for the historical lessons. This started it all people. Watch it, and love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First released to a shocked public in 1974, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has a deserved reputation as a compelling part of a new wave of American horror films. Terrifyingly dark and based on factual events, Tobe Hooper's controversial and chillingly atmospheric films involves the tragedy that befell a group of 5 teenagers one summer afternoon. This film was inspired by the grave-robber/murderer Ed Gein. A truly disturbing film which makes an indelible print on your mind after watching it. It may not seem scary when you watch it today but back in 1974 it scared a lot of people. A great Horror classic that will go down in history.ENJOY!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie is pretty good. If you like slasher flicks then this movie is definitely for you. I thought there were times when this movie was pretty corny but then you have to remember when it was made. Toby Hooper did a good job of getting you to feel pretty creeped out at times. this movie reminds me of house of a thousand corpses. so if you liked that you will like this movie. The end of this movie made me laugh a little bit but i will not spoil it for you. the story is like many others in the genre. A group of kids are on a trip and they get stuck and go to the creepy house where bad things happen to them. this movie is the best of them all. Just like many others. If you want to see the Texas chainsaw massacre see toby hoopers it is not only the original but it is the best one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I caught this film, it was actually playing on TV one Halloween weekend in Southern California, probably sometime in the late 80s, early 90s. I was shocked, as I never anticipated I would be able to watch the film as it rarely played anywhere. The title alone was enough to initially keep me away as I couldn't imagine anything as gruesome as a killer wielding a chainsaw against his unsuspecting victims. What surprised me most was the realism added by the grainy footage and the quasi-Method performances. I should note that at this time I still clung to the belief that this film was in fact based on a true story (a belief to which many who watched it still adhere).This film has everything that was right about American horror cinema in the 1970s. Marilyn Burns is absolutely brilliant, I don't think I've ever seen a female protagonist in this or any film since that conveyed her sense of absolute terror and dread. Before the horror cliché of the empowered female victim became widespread, Burns plays an infinitely more realistic variant, fighting and running not so much to defeat Leatherface and his kin as to simply escape with her life. And I can't remember any scene in any film as dreadful as the one in which the family assists Grandpa in attempting to brain her. That so little actual graphic violence is ever actually depicted speaks volumes of the films successfully twisted mood and direction.Having lived in Texas for some time now, there is an added dimension of realism. Some isolated highways in this state (of which there are several) have several houses and service stations that resemble the ones featured in this movie. In particular, the drive between Houston and Austin via the 21 and 290 and the drive from Waco to Houston via the 6 and 290 are all too eerily familiar. Having made that drive many a night, I always made certain I had enough gas to drive through without stopping.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm going to be blunt on this review. This movie has great potential, however the acting, primarily on Sallys part, needs some work. The movie was created in the 70's, and it doesn't have cutting edge technology to rely on. The movie posses many great elements of a cult classic: psychological mind games, suspense, excitement, and gore. However the acting, oh the acting is terrible. The only thing the character Sally did was scream and scream. Leatherface, however, didn't posses a major part in this movie. I can see why this movie plays a major role in horror history in many elements. However i have to give this movie a 7.5/10 because of the acting.Final Score: 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is pretty much my opinion on the never ending debate about the Texas Chainsaw Massacre being true or false.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people seem to think that the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is not true. Well I think it is. There is no way that someone can come up with something that so many people admit to knowing about. The Travis County Police Department even has a report filed on the case of "Leatherface"! So if we have so much evidence that it did happen why do so many people think that the movie is based on a man named Ed Gein? I do know that there was a man named Ed Guin who was involved in cannibalism and murder young women, but how do you get the story of the Texas Chainsaw massacre from that totally different story! So for every single person out there who do believe that this is a real story I agree 100% and I'm going to keep arguing my point until someone finally admits nationally that this is a TRUE story! I'll probably be arguing this point until the day I die!Now that I have that point across I might as well tell you what I thought about the movie myself! I thought that the movie was pretty gruesome in some parts but otherwise its not that bad. I admit, sitting next to a window in the middle of the night when it is pitch black, while you're watching the movie is not the best thing to do because then you just get scared even worse! I give The Texas Chainsaw Massacre two thumbs up! A 5* rating!</fullReview>

When I first heard about it - stories were far more brutal, astonishong...And I had this terrible picture in my mind about this movie...But when I seen it I couldn't believe how tame it is, how he doesn't live up to stories and legends that follow him... But then - this is far more serious movie that has much more to say than gore, terror, suspense ever could! Its about how little you can know about people that surround you. How unspeakable things can be right next door. It's atmosphere that drives. And despair of knowing their faith draws you to be very, very afraid. Killing scenes are often out of sight. You never see any gore - but you think about it! You see it all clearly in your mind! You will dream of this movie years after you'we seen it! And you'll never hitch-hike at ease!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie due to the nitty gritty feel. The heat, smells, and pain seep through the screen while watching this trashy demented gem. From the beginning of the blistering morning shots to the blood soaked dawn, this movie is definitely a good ride into insanity. Based loosely, and I mean loosely off of the Ed Gein story, it delivers awkwardness and fun. Amazingly enough with such a strong title, one would expect a lot of gore...not the case. It just goes to prove that you don't always need gore to scare the heck out of you. This film may not be regarded as great, but it had a lot of heart and it showed these no name actors had a lot of dedication for being put through the elements. The movie is low budget and a little uncomfortable to watch but definitely a must for all horror fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this about 13 years ago at age 20. Prior to that I had only seen little bits &amp; pieces of it (pun not intended). It wasn't until it was part of the shockumentary 'Terror in the Aisles' that I heard about its connection to real events and Ed Gein - who inspired it. The real Gein was known to be a cannibal, transvestite, and necrophile - all of which is largely implied here save for the last part - there is plenty of gore, but a lot is left to the imagination, such as when Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) revs up his chainsaw in preparation for cutting up the girl he impaled on the meat hook.While the photography kind of reminded me of the style in which 'The Blair Witch Project' was shot, one has to take it in context considering this was a fairly low-budget film. If anything, it adds to the film because it gives the impression of being shot by someone who is actually caught up in the events. The acting is also fairly convincing, especially Marilyn Burns as Sally and Edwin Neal as the demented hitchhiker. Neal's character is one that makes your skin crawl. Burns is highly effective as the heroine Sally, the sole survivor of the group the film follows. Gunnar Hansen (Leatherface), while he doesn't seem to have a single line in the movie, makes up for it with his bulky appearance and squealing sounds when he catches his victims, not to mention his hideous appearance in the human-skin mask and blood-splattered butcher's apron.The fact that some of the things we see in the film were actually done by Gein (human-skin lampshades, human-bone armrests mounted to chairs) made it even more chilling. No doubt one of the most horrific films ever created. The remake is respectable but not quite like the original. **** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is truly a cult classic. It is one of my very favorite movies of all time. I guess you could classify this film as a "slasher" flick however, unlike so many other "slasher" films, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has top notch acting. It also has a feel of believability to it that is usually hard to pull off. Every character, large and small, gives a great acting performance. The movie really is shocking. Even 30 years after it's release, it still shocks most people. I can only imagine the shock and terror that this movie created when it first came out! Besides the good story, great acting, and shock value of this classic, this movie is also important because this movie introduces horror fans to one of the most notorious bad guys ever, Leatherface!! If anyone has not seen this great movie, be sure to pick it up and give it a watch!! 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quote me on that.I am not a huge fan of horror movies below 1970. I have seen every horror movie from 1970 'till now. Minus some of the very cheesy ones. My favourite movie of all-time until this day is Halloween but I adore John Carpenters masterpiece from a couple of other reasons.If I thought of the scariest movie ever made. Something that just made you feel sick. The first thing I would think of is definitely Texas Chainsaw Massacre.I've heard it all. This movie is funny. It's a joke. It's pointless.Life is a joke. It's funny at times and it's pointless here and there until your life and the lives of your friends are in danger by a cannibalistic chainsaw wielding maniac.Very real, very to the point. Tobe Hooper almost makes it seem like a documentary. Some excellent shots as well.This flick is brilliantly designed to scare you in a very sick way. In fact, if I were to compare it to a movie, i'd compare it to the way Requiem for a Dream made me feel after seeing it.It's definitely a cult classic. I don't give two shits if it's 2035, it'll still be the scariest movie i've ever seen.And the last hour or so of this movie, around the famous dinner scene is absolutely disturbing.Leatherface will never top Michael Myers but he's just one more face to really be afraid of.9/10</fullReview>

There's something very real, something very vivid about the movie. The people that have complained that the deaths are too quick - well, I'm sorry, but surely that adds realism and makes it scarier? I guess it's the difference between a Stanislavskian horror movie and Brechtian horror movie. Well, I think the Stanislavski way is the ONLY way to go in horror - presenting something that feels real.Most of the people that didn't like the movie say that the end section was the best bit too. Well for me, the first 2 deaths are the real selling point of this movie. They come completely out of the blue and very scarily. One minute there's nothing to fear - the next the film takes on a completely different tone. The build up of a sound collage when Pam falls into the room with all the skulls is one of the most effectively creepy scenes I've ever seen on film.And everyone that keeps saying 'I thought this was supposed to be groundbreaking?'. Um... yes... it IS groundbreaking. Did you forget it was made 30 years ago?A very very shocking movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a very fun,and scary film. It starts out when a grave robbing spree hits rural Texas.A group of friends go to the town to visit two of the traveler's Grandfather's home,and to check if his crypt his been disturbed. They go,and meet,a friendly B.B.Q restaurant owner,or so they thought. They go to their Grandfather's house,and the kids start disappearing.They start to realize a mad brute named Leatherface is killing them one by one with his chainsaw.Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a very effective scare flick. It has some excellent moments,and some very shocking kills. Even though I saw Michael Bay's remake first,I was pleasantly surprised by how better this one was.4/4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i only write this because the last review i saw here completely missed the point. this movie is a masterpiece. it's not kurosawa, agreed, but it's probably the most artistic and visually overwhelming horror film ever made, and sure one of the hardest. a perfect minimalistic script, fantastic photography, great art design, a disturbing strange soundtrack, good performances etc. it has a weird and unsettling humor that adds to the horror (instead of relieving from it as done in most splatter films). some people might be surprised by the almost complete absence of gore. this is not a stupid slasher flick!i just discovered a very prominent support for my opinion: ridley scott himself expresses his admiration for 'the Texas chainsaw massacre' on the 'alien director's cut special edition'-DVD: "i think Texas is the most formidable... if you gonna do a horror movie, there it is."if you need to laugh yourself through a horror movie stay away, you do injustice to this film and won't like it. everyone else - see it. and see it again. even if you did not like it in the first place. there is good reason for it's good reputation!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Specifically shot and still actual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The country I live in is not that easy to purchase this kind of classic films, that's why I first had to watch the remake of `Texas chainsaw massacre' which I considered (and still consider) to be the best remake one ever could shot. Well, let's start with that the original's quite different. These two have nothing in common. That's why, don't compare them, Hooper built the characters just like they could be in the real life. Everything is very natural here. The music is replaced with noises (don't worry, it's one more plus) which are going to scare you more you can imagine (of course if you have enough nerves not to turn away from screen or not to turn the volume down). The only problem is that if you've had an opportunity of watching the original first and then just the final one, then it's O.K., but if you watch the 74 chainsaw the second, then you may not like it at once. You see, in the remake it's clear that leather face enjoys working with chain saw; it's like his favorite toy, right? Well, from this point of view, the original is just `Texas massacre' without `chainsaw' because the maniac starts enjoying the saw only in the final scene on the road after he loses Sally ? this part I call `the saw-dance', it's really a wonderful part and excellent ending. One more difference between these two is in the 2003 remake leather face is much more serious and smarter and faster. We analyzed what the original does not have (and that's only because we compare it with the remake, but we don't have to do it at all). Now let's talk about the pluses. They are plenty - the atmosphere you won't see anywhere else, super photography, specific soundtrack (and still actual nowadays like the whole movie), actors' brilliant play and something that couldn't be here so high taking into account the low budget and the year, these are the effects. Some will call John Dugan's make-up (he's the half-dead `grandpa' here) and appearance standard. O.K., no problem, but what about the part when the saw falls down on leather face's leg cutting the skin through don't letting him stay unconscious? Perhaps it's cheap but nice and as I already mentioned - natural. At least it's like a real skin. Besides, if you've been interesting then you probably the corpse of the man in the very beginning of the movie has been made by Hooper himself. It makes you respect the man, doesn't it?The main difference between the original and the remake is Hooper put all his heart in this film, and despite of having too little money he created something that no one could remake. Once again, it doesn't mean I say Nispel's work is bad; it's excellent? My respect to Hooper has nothing to do with everything I wrote here. Frankly, sometimes I really try to defend his movies but don't have to do it now, because this `chainsaw' is more than a cult movie or a classic horror ? It's a film which even partially can serve (I mean `has already served') for the development of many genres starting with horror and right to psychological thriller. In one word, if you haven't seen this film then you haven't seen anything at all. When I wanted it very bad, and didn't have it, I used to envy to everybody who had watched it. And now when I've finally got it, I watch it again and again and still can't get enough. Thank you, Mr. Hooper, I knew you won't let down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just seen this film again, actually I've acquired it and it is still immensely powerful. I was also incredibly surprised at how short the film is but is engrossing from the very first minute. The film makes me realise how bad many of the atrocious movies the film spawned really are. Its power is in the mind of the watcher. It is certainly not gory but there is an element of menace throughout that is accentuated by your own mind's ability to imagine how thing felt or what was actually being done while the chainsaw buzzed. On top of this is the finest screaming I have heard in many a year and some very effective camera work. Watch it with lights off and alone !!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Film, But Not Totally True</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the texas chainsaw massacre, i was depressed. This film is full of no hope and it put me on such a downer, but i loved it. However it inspired me to do some reasearch, only to find that the film is only very very loosely based on a true story. Leatherface, real name Ed gein, did not live in texas. He did rob graves however, but only commited two murders, neither of which included use of a chainsaw and neither of which took place in Texas. However i still found Ed's storys both disturbing yet interesting, and i still love the movie. Though maybe the title should be "The Massacre".... Just hasn't got that ring to it has it. I also saw the new TCM, i was pretty disappointed, they made Leatherface out to be this totally sadistic murdering villian, which he isn't shown to be in the original. I guess most will disagree with that though. Haha i love the bit where leatherface trys to sneak out the kitchen, and his... Dad?! just shouts and goes "GET BACK IN THERE" and he just cowers back into the kitchen, Awww classic. Anyways enough babbling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the ultimate horror nightmare movie about a crazed family of slaughter-house workers who kill and torture people in their Texan farmhouse. Six-foot-four, Leatherface is probably the ultimate screen boogie man who is sure to give even the most hardened horror addict nightmares. There are some very funny moments, including the attempt by the ancient old grandfather of the family to hit a victim over the head with a hammer but is ultimately to weak to do so. Another funny moment occurs where a victim throws a hammer at Leatherface, hitting him on the head and knocking him down and he accidentally cuts his own leg with the chainsaw. Very scary, very tense, with some great acting by a largely unknown cast. I haven't seen the re-make and don't want to, because nothing can beat this classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie alone one night and I must admit, it was scary. You could, of course dismiss the movie as funny or ludicrous, but then that's something you could do to just about any horror flick (with the volume down or while watching with a bunch of friends).The story itself is simple enough - killer brothers hunting to feed their cannibal grandparents. A group of teenagers get killed one by one, by 'Leatherface'...Not too much gore, but enough makeup, screaming, running around and decaying corpses to compensate. Quite the opposite of Psycho, Rosemary's baby and the like - the horror here is pretty obvious.Anyway, worth a watch for the normal movie-lover, and a must-see if you like those gruesome and scary ones. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a brutal, gritty , in your face killing spree. The film is distressing for some, but over all it's not scary in this day and age. The film is about a bunch of teenagers who terrorised by a chain-saw welding loony, Leather Face.That's all Im saying cause it'll spoil the plot, but as a 14 year old myself I thought it was amazingly funny.The film tries to offend the viewer by throwing all sorts at things at them but it dont succseed! The only thing it does succseed is by making the viewer laugh, until they cry. But on a serious note, the goodness of this film only sinks in a few hours after.After a while you could even feel sorry for the disturbed Leather Face!! I own the DVD and intend to buy the rest of the series by the impression the first film gave me. If you like B-movie horror or just a good laugh this is a must buy! 4 out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie for the very first time a few years ago when a friend of mine decided to rent it for Halloween. From the moment the scroll came down narrating the chilling beginning of the tale, we looked at each other like 'What have we gotten ourselves into'.Me being a horror fan and haven't seen anything really scary in years, I was at the edge of my seat watching this thing. It was that disturbing. Everything from the eery sounds and the deserted Texas environment set the tone for this morbid tale. And from the moment when Leatherface makes his great entrance, the action never stops. Every scene got more and more intense until I couldn't wait for it to be over.Surprisingly, this movie is not very gory and I don't remember much blood at all, but the entire movie plays like a very, long nightmare.A true classic, it was scarier than anything I'd seen in years and shows that you don't need high-tech special effects to achieve true horror.Rent this one today and turn off all the lights!</fullReview>

It wasn't as scary, or gory as a lot of people would have you believe, it probably was when it originally came out in 1974. I still love it, Tobe Hooper is a psycho, but if it wasn't for him, horror movies today wouldn't be so awesome. I don't think it should been labeled a true story, because their is hardly any truth to the movie, it didn't even happen in Texas. Still the movie is awesome and I recommend it to everyone who loves horror movies. 9/10 .....last</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (20003) 2 1/2 stars out of 5Hewitt Family BBQ Recipe:1 state of Texas 1 family of cannibals (preferably 6) 5 disposable teens 1 big ass chainsaw 0 signs of helpMix em all together and let simmer for about an hour and a half. Once finished, you've got another so-so hollywood remake.Like most after viewing this remake or "re-imagining" (as Tim Burton likes to throw around), I asked myself why? There's nothing bad about this film really, but there's nothing exceptional either. After four previous entries, why was a fifth deemed necessary? To make money, pure and simple. An updated cast, an updated look and even an updated Leatherface still aren't enough to make people overlook the original. Whomever dons the human skin-mask of "Thomas Hewitt, the man they call Leatherface" and he does a standard job (Gunner Hanson's hulking brutality will never be matched or even missed for that matter) unfortunately this Leatherface could have been anyone Maybe it's just that way for some. Those who originated roles or played them numerous times - like the first time you saw Freddy Krueger, Jason Vorhees or The Shape, Leatherface, Candyman even the voice of Chucky - some were just born to play these roles and not even time can steal them away.Speaking of time, not much has changed in remake land and it's pretty much same ol' same ol' (except nowadays every movie is over populated with teens looking way to good, even covered in blood and in being hacked away by a man with a giant chainsaw). Tobe Hooper's original was simple and scary - so scary that I almost know the movie by heart after seeing it only a couple of times (it has that much of an impression the first time that you can't help but become imersed in the terror, it's literally nervewracking). I remember saying after my initial viewing of the original that I would nerver watch it again - no need to. I was wrong and still is so vivd, even with multiple viewings. This remake however, well that can't really be said. What can be said is once is enough (actually once was enough before the last three sequels). Aside from a change in the films final act and a few small improvements there's really nothing special here.SPOILER ALERTI will say the third act is the only really scary, solid chunk of the movie. Finally a new, yet simple (so simple in fact I can't believe it's never been before) scene in which the villain is messed up for a change (and I'm not talking about the typical sending Freddy to hell final act-ass kicking either). Leatherface loses an arm this time around and hacked away at pretty good towards the end. It was a nice touch - and long overdue taste of your own medicine of sorts. I also enjoyed the twist on the hitchiker at the opening. Since most of it was pretty much the same as the original, little spins like these welcome additions to keep old fans slightly out of step and succeptable to surprises.END OF SPOILERSThe Cast overall did what they had to yet the 1974 original's lead outshoned 2003's "star" (maybe the answer lies in the terminology) Jessica Biel. Biel's really succeeds at making all of her outfits work. Yes that's the biggest compliment I gan give, I'm sorry. R. Lee Emery tries hard and he's fine but overall it's still the same thing we've seen from him as well. It's always fun but now it's really starting to get a little old (no pun intended). Familiarity runs amok alongside with Leatherface in this remak-err, re-imagining.The lack of real gore surprised me - mainly because it worked.It follows the rules: the less you see, the more frightening it is. Mind you the original aimed for a PG rating, but was denied. It really isn't much gorey itself. It's just that much scarier. This is a powerful film - in it's own way. The original I mean, always the original. Too bad...There's no real terror here - this is cannibalistic mass murders done light, well light enough. Bottom line is you could do alot worse than this and while it may be slick and fun - stick with the original to leave you breathless. On a related note, enough with remakes already, please! Rarely do they compare and most of the time the soil the original's name. My skin crawls thinking about the proposed remake of Halloween and I hope it doesn't happen. Producers take note remakes are not necessary, educate people to the existance of the originals or re-invent the franchise ala Bride of Chucky and Freddy Vs. Jason. There's something to be said for new ideas, and money to be made. Otherwise we - the movie going public are given mediocre retreads like this.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2003... Not memorable, not necessary. Fun none the less - personally I found it more enjoyable than Kill Bill - but hey, that's just me. Like I mentioned before: you could do worse, alot worse. At least they got rid of Franklin, the annoying guy in the wheelchair this time around... Oh, and they changed Leatherface's name from Bubba to Thomas. Thanks, ...I guess?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I avoided watching The Texas Chain Saw Massacre as I avoided the Godfather and the first Rocky picture because I had a preconceived notion about these films based on the years of copycats and parodies. Well it may have taken me ten years, but I finally caught up with Tobe Hooper's genre maker and I was completely floored by it. I guess I can thank Hollywood for bringing this 'classic' to my attention with their half-hearted remake. Let's get this out of the way, the scares here are REAL. They are the stuff of nightmares. Hooper's camera stays trained on the details, on the horror, longer than you want him to,. Longer than your sanity can withstand in some cases. There's no cat jumping out of a closet type stuff here. There's no satanic rock music, or 'ironic' pop tunes. The killing is neither flashy nor witty. It is just brutal. The insanity is not 'funny'. This is not black humor, there is in fact nothing to smile about in the film until perhaps the final chase which is so surreal, it unnerves you in a completely different way. I defy anyone not to be completely wigged out by the dinner table scene. I defy anyone not to be completely terrified by the door left open on the night in the Gas Station scene near the film's end. He manages to create monsters that are human in every way but the ones that matter the most. Having been fed Michael Myers (in many sequels), Jason, Freddy Chucky and any number of invincible 'magic' ghouls, it was incredible to see that the character that helped spawn them all "Leatherface" was a character who exists on our physical realm and must play by our rules. He doesn't warp, he doesn't stalk, he runs and flails, and the final seen of him dancing a morbid dance with his chainsaw as his partner is eerily vacant of meaning. </fullReview>

The hitchhiker is one of the strangest characters ever commited to film. All the little things he pulls out of his fur "purse" and what he does with them...creepy. Leatherface is of course a classic american psycho right up there with Jason and Freddy - although he's scarier because he's realistic. Not superhuman, just demented....I really could imagine a guy doing that (supposedly Ed Gein came pretty close). Overall is it scary? Not really, just effectively strange and mind-bending.

My parents were telling me how it was one of the scariest movies they ever saw. When I watched it at a friends house we sat there dumbfounded. It was so weird; there was no story line. It was a mess. The fact that it is considered one of the scariest films ever made shocked me. At the time of the film's original release I'm sure it was scary because people had never seen anything like it. But today it is one of the least scary movies out there. One of the scariest aspects behind the film is the fact that it's based on true events. THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE is almost as bad as the sequels it produced. I suggest seeing the original just to see it. I think this films should be given a D- and 1.3 out of 4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time about a year ago. Already being a horror fan, I assumed this "classic" would be no better or worse than any other "classic" in the horror genre. Simply put, most horror movies are not brilliant and the ones that are usually cross-over into suspense thrillers, science fiction, or mysteries. I was unpleasantly surprised to find the one true precursor to most modern slasher films. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is horrifying and shocking, more so for its time I'm sure. The simplicity of this film and it's perfectly square characters add to the heightened sense of "reality." The bad acting is the same bad acting that made The Blair Witch Project such a success. If you go in not expecting too much of a plot or the best in photography you may be unpleasantly surprised as well and like me find yourself up until sunrise reading Harry Potter behind locked doors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know alot of people dont like this movie, and i was sitting around asking myself why, then it hit me, it's DIFFERENT from absolutely every other horror movie there is,the way i see it is, 99 percent of horror movies are based on the "jump" factor, the ability to thrill someone for about a period of a second and a half. Most people consider that to be horrific. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre however leaves an everlasting fear simply because it is so real, there isnt any supernatural powers, there arent any cars that wont start for some reason, every single thing in that movie could easily happen, now i'm not saying there arent any "jump" scenes in this movie, there are a few that are done quite well, but when referring to this movie, the "jump" scenes are not the scenes that are frightening in this movie, the dinner scene, and the notorius meathook scenes are the parts in the movie which truly stand out, and they are by no means "jumpy", they are truly horrific scenes that stay in the mind forever, in my opinion anyway,I dont get scared from jump scenes because they now bore me,I see them in every horror movie ever made, and it's a shame people think this movie sucks because it is different from every other horror movie, and it's also a shame that people get scared from the same old crap put in every horror movie. Anyway,the only reason i am writing this is because i saw the new one last night, and it was just like every other horror movie ever made, alot of jump scenes, and a girl that was SO hot running through either a meat freezer with water coming down, or running outside where it is raining, any chance to get her wet i suppose, ah well, new one sucks, original one is amazing</fullReview>

What works the best for me is that there is no aspect in the movie that was totally beyond belief. I can see all of that around me and I don't even live in Texas. Some folks are very serious about their privacy for a reason. And those of you that smirk and think otherwise need to get out more - See the country - scratch the surface. Bones everywhere, the use of hammers, some very strange looking meat - these are the little things that add up to a lot. These are the things that make me wish more movies would be just what they are instead of getting lost in what they can never be.

I begged and begged my mother to rent it for me, one day while my dad was away on a business trip I came home from school and found out mom had rented it for me. Oh, the joy! So I pop the flick in the VCR. Now, I'm sure back in the day, people thought this film was terrifying. And sure, I found some parts of the film to be very, very frightening. The suspense in the first act is masterfully handled, and the introduction of Leatherface haunted me for the next several days. It's just the rest of the film teetered back and forth between comedy and horror... I recently saw the film on late night cable with Tobe Hooper providing commentary and the man himself admitted he didn't realize how darkly humorous the film was. I'm sure he didn't set out to make a black comedy, but it no way does having a little dark humour lessen the significance of this film in any way. It's still a great film to watch, especially with your drinking buddies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>May contain spoilersThis film is about a group of teens visiting graves to make sure their grandparent's grave hasn't been robbed as there have been grave robbings in that part of rural Texas. They unfortunately take a turn for the worst when they run into the Sawyer family.This is one of the best horrors of the 70's if not of all time. Why? Lets go through the good points:Some of the props are real. The skeletons are real. I bet you didn't think them bones were real when watching. It shocked me a little to learn that.Another reason that this movie is so good is Marylin Burns. She was really cut and bleeding very badly(remember that scene where she was covered in blood? It was hers!). Even after enduring that she manages to put in one of the best performances I've seen. She gets whacked over the head in one scene. She edged the actor to hit her harder. It's a crying shame that she didn't have a better career.I liked the scene with all the dead people at the start. It's pretty disturbing and gory but stick it out. Apart from that there is virtually no gore at all.I also liked Gunnar Hansen's performance as Leatherface. I also liked the way Leatherface acted. The way he was with the chainsaw. I wish he was a bit more like Ed Gein but I'm not complaining. A great scene is where he is licking his lips will send a shudder down everyone's back.I liked the jump scenes. They were well timed, well directed and not over the top. Another thing I like is the look. It gives it a nice but creepy realistic feel.I like the fact that the girls in this movie are really hot!It may not scare you too much but believe me no true horror fan can be without this classic. 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Easily one of the most brutal and devastating films to sit through. It has a very realistic almost documentary edge to it which lends the film a powerful resonance. It stays in the mind and has literally unforgettable images throughout. I particularly like the fact a lot of it goes against convention such as the fact the house is an idyllic farmhouse bathed in sunlight. The films actors are believable and not depicted as desperate for sex or other typical scenarios akin to this genre. The slamming of the metal door after the first murder terrified me years ago when I first saw it and it still disturbs me. There is something about it that is so final, so definite. This is a mature film, let alone a mature horror film and it shames most of the other attempts at horror in recent years. It conjures up tense moments, gut wrenching brutality and jaw-dropping scenes of absolute terror. Those other pretenders cannot touch this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raw horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very good horror film that is typical of how horrors used to be made, relying on raw atmosphere rather than endless gore. Leatherface is one of the all time great horror icons and in many ways is scarier than Michael Myers and Jason. A psycho cross dresser with a chainsaw, now thats unsettling. At times tongue in cheek TCM is slow for the first 1/3 but once it gets going is relentless. Recommended for any horror fan or anyone who appreciates a good low budget film when they see one. Despite a few nasty scenes there isn't really anything that justifies the long ban that was put on the film, maybe it was the claim that 'IT HAPPENED'! Even if it probably didn't.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well i don't see what's so terrifying about this movie but that's just me. I didn't watch The Texas Chainsaw Massacre for chills but i did watch it for excitement and it delivers BIG TIME. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was banned in the UK for 25 years so i expected something really shocking. It's not, there is very little blood and gore but the idea was shocking. I mean a maniac running around wielding a chainsaw is shocking but your not going to see any gruesome injuries caused by the chainsaw so if your looking for that, then avoid this one and watch horror movies like The Burning and The Prowler. There is quite a long dull gap in the middle of this movie with not much happening but the movie itself only lasts for around 75 minutes so it doesn't get that boring. If The Texas Chainsaw Massacre lasted 120 minutes then it would be hard to stay awake so i'm glad it is a short movie. The finale is very thrilling and turn up the volume on your TV to get the full effect. The sound of the chainsaw mixed in with the constant screaming of the leading lady is unparalled in any movie and will always be remembered by me. On the whole The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is better than most other slasher movies even without the blood but for the life of me i can't think why those awful sequels were made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My all-time fav movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to begin? The Texas Chain Saw Massacre...hmmmm.Well, my mother came home one day, with a bunch of ex-rentals from the video-store. I have a look through them...and there it is. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. A grotesque cover indeed. A girl grabbing onto a poll, screaming her lungs out. Behind her, a pair of blooded hands hold a terrifyingly scary looking chainsaw. Along the top is written "The Uncut True Story", along the the bottom "PREVIOUSLY BANNED! R 18+ TRUE TERROR!"Dear me! If you think the front cover sounds bad, I won't even go into the back cover...well, of course, being 12 at the time, I was scared out of my wits just looking at the cover. I let it go 2 months before I finally gave in, and gave it a look...Well, I knew this was going a to be a traditional slasher, probably some gore, some big breasted girl getting stalked, etc. In horror terms, I had only seen Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. *Laughs* I really had no clue what I was in for!!!The opening monologue rolls, and it comes off as a true story. OK, I now officially have the jitters. The movie gets into play, we meet our teens. They seem nice enough. I like them all. NOTE: This copy was VERY old and worn out, but that helped create the atmosphere!I'm not going to bore you with the total outline of the story, so I will just go into what I thought.I found it very hard to sleep for weeks after I had finally finished the film. Most of the time during the movie, my jaw was wide open in shock. The fact that I thought this was a true story didn't help!I almost shat myself when I saw Leatherface for the first time. He was so fudging freaky! The movie is just terrifying right the way through.The ending had my clinging to my seat, almost in tears! LEATHERFACE DIDN'T DIE!!! HE'S STILL OUT THERE!?!? Was my initial reaction. Holy hell!Part of what makes this movie so terrifying is the isolation. Nobody could here poor little Sally Hardesty Enright scream her little lungs out during this movie, except for more psychopaths!!!This is a movie that can, in the words of Rex Reed "drive you right out of your mind!" That is exactly what happens to poor Sally at the end of the film.I remember just craving MORE after I had seen this movie! I had to know what happened next! Being unable to find parts 2 and 3 initially, I went straight on to the Next Generation, but that's another review.Well, 5 years later, I might well be Australia's biggest TCM fan. I have all the movies on DVD and several different VHS releases. I have the figure of Leatherface, the movie poster on my wall, and even the lunch-box!Texas Chain Saw Massacre will live on in my psyche forever, and I still can't pass an old house with peeling paint and a rusty wire door without thinking killers reside there!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Damn Disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people agree, one of our biggest fears is clowns. Mine is Rednecks... Ghastly re-creations of your worst Redneck nightmares come to life in this chilling portrayal of inbreeding against God's will. Be afraid!Plot: There is a sadistic cannibalistic inbred family somewhere in Texas (around Ft. Worth). Solution: Avoid Texas!!!When I was young I was told by friends to see this movie and told by parents to avoid it. And now here I am representing IMDb's highest profile, a male, age 26. Seeing as there is a remake of the classic '74 flick in production, I felt I should contact the source. My mama was right, this movie is quite disturbing, not for the faint of heart. Now ranks in my top three horror movies - 'Night of the Living Dead' 'Halloween' included.I expected cheesy acting and I got inbred family values to extreme, I expected gore, and I got suspense and quick willed slaughters. I expected closure and I got expanded horrors from within Texas. This movie disturbs brothers on death row. Beyond the reach of God we see how humans can go astray.Obviously, we see inspirations for modern thrillers throughout (Blair Witch) but more importantly we see a peak monument in horror film genre, where the villain is not a zombie, or the undead - rather a deranged human being. There is no 'cut &amp; paste' gore violence in this, only aesthetic serial killer violence. With much of the blood shed to be imagined in in-digestible ways. (The body twitching from the first kill is blood-curdling). Must see for murder enthusiast. Not a 'First Date' movie.Bottom Line: Three words draw thoughts of horror and dread in my mind, "Massacre" "Chainsaw" &amp; "Texas". Ed Gein never had it like this. But goddamn if he wouldn't enjoy it a a cent less. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>TCM is sheer brilliance on a horrific scale; Hooper portrays the horror genre in it most definitive form. However the film is so convincing that you feel as though you are actually watching reality, the screaming is enough to sail you into the swells of madness. This film brings across a tense repulsive sensation that ultimately leaves you discontented and somewhat disturbed. If you have a fondness for watching, people suffer with crazed sick cannibals running after them and torturing the naive individuals than you will enjoy this film. Otherwise, don't bother with the experience, which in itself is maddening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like a lot of other people, i never got round to seeing this until the ban was lifted, and Oh Boy it didn't disappoint, i love horror movies, but this one was less scary and more freeky, it left a bad taste in your mouth for ages, it's one of those horrors you still think of days later. being a low budget movie i think added to the story, and was the reason it was so successful, if it would have been a huge hollywood film none of the scenes would have looked so real, almost like it was all done on a candid camera(which i am sure it was)this is the reason the characters were so real and didn't seem to be acting, but i am sure the scene involving a meat hook was thoroughly acted over and went through a lot of rehearsals before the day was through. This was a good fleshy horror, you can really enjoy watching with your friends for a laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first i was tempted to stop watching because movie seemed boring and slow-paced - made me feel that I am wasting my time with this 70s horror piece. But the other half of the movie was captivating and although I cannot say that I *enjoyed* watching it, I never turned my eyes off the screen even though at moments I felt the need to look around, making sure that everything was still safe. The high point of the film is the first chase scene - Marilyn Burns as Sally Hardesty does a great job in this, especially at the end in the gas station where she delivers her shock very believably. Overall great classical horror flick - don't miss it if you're into this kind of movies. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly a seminal work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that a lot of people do not appreciate today because people they now need a great deal of gore or great special effects to impress them. However if you are a fan of the Horror genre you can't help but be amazed by how much this movie has influenced all the horror movies that have come after it. Think about the first Friday the 13th movie, Evil Dead, or more recently Jeepers Creepers. Jeepers Creepers incorporates pretty much every element, every archetype seen in the Texas Chain Saw Massacre: from collecting your victims' body parts, to wearing them. Or how about nosy teens insisting on looking where they have no business looking, and then being stalked and murdered. Texas Chain Saw remains a classic because it delivers all these essential horror elements in an unpretentious simple manner with no gimmicks. If you look at the movie from this perspective you will stand a much better chance of enjoying it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brutal synthesis... (ULTRA-SPOILERS!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...of the Ed Gein case and the Manson Family, "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" is a reverse of "Night of the Living Dead", the movie "Manos" could have been, and the model for every slasher pic after. What make it work is the documentary-style way it was shot, and the fact that there is little blood (so the audience imagines the worst.) I call it an inverted "NotLD" because the farmhouse has been turned from a rickety shelter from zombies to where the evil resides (a motif it shares with "Manos") and it takes very few changes to turn the "Manos" cult into a family of cannibals. Like "Manos", we have a group of people, some related, on a trip across rural Texas. In the case of "TCM" a young woman, her wheelchair-bound brother, and a couple of old friends are out on a hot summer's day to see if the graves of her grandparents have been disturbed because a rash of grave robbings has occurred. After which, they go to the grandparent's abandoned farmhouse for a dip in the old swimming hole. On the way they pick up a bizarro who used to work at a defunct slaughterhouse who cuts his own hand, then cuts the gimp's hand, and is thrown out of the van. Once they reach the farmhouse, a "Venus Fly Trap" effect happens near a neighboring house, and it's here were the movie shifts into high gear. I would like to say right now that the title is a gyp; only one person is chainsawed while alive. However, the pain and misery of the young women was real; the meathook scene was very painful, and for the final torture, that girl's thumb was actually cut. I've read that Hooper had a rotting animal carcass on the set, and that the stench was nauseating. And, unlike what the Maltin guide states, John Larroquette is billed as the narrator.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*spoilers may be ahead*One thing first: this isn't Halloween. This isn't Friday the 13th. This isn't Child's Play. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is just a brutal unstoppable machine. It makes you feel like there's no escape from the clutch thisn film has. Like The Exorcist and Psycho, this film is out dated, and some audiences may find it "laughable" or "funny" but if you do, may I recommend a psychiatrist? For the feminists here, the Texas Chainsaw massacre isn't brutality twoards women, one women dies compared to 4 males. This film is about some innocent kids finding the dark insane side of humantiy. THis is Ed Gein's stroy. The decrepit farm house, the human decorations, the necrophelism, the cannibalism. This film never lets you go. I recommend it to anyone with a strong stomach. Really the only peaceful moment here is when Kirk and Pam walk through a field. Anytime else,. there's some suspense. Buy the DVD, rent the video, I dare you.Also recommend: The Omen The Exorcist Psycho</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember being surprised, upon leaving the theater after watching the Blair Witch Project on opening night, at the number of people who were frightened and disturbed by it. I had mostly been bored as hell, and found no value in the film. So I started listening in on the conversation, and I began to hear the same line repeated over and over: "I can't believe that actually happened. It must have been so scary!"The same is said often of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, in an attempt to excuse its complete idiocy and inanity. "Oh, it actually happened, and Hooper was simply retelling the story." NO - I'm sorry, this is LOOSELY - UTTERLY LOOSELY based on the same serial killer Ed Gein that Psycho slasher Norman Bates is based on - and look how VASTLY different the movies are. Serial killers may often be used for inspiration, but rarely is there enough story on its own.Saying that, I'd appreciate no more flipping comments about how "it must have been so scary for those poor teenagers" - because there were no teenagers. Don't be duped into thinking this actually happened in order to be scared. The movie, first and foremost, should be able to survive without this knowledge - which it doesn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the hot summer of 1973 a movie was created. It was a movie which set the trend of horror movies for years to come. It was movie which shocked the world with it's depiction of 5 teenagers falling victim to a chainsaw welding maniac known as 'Leatherface'. However, the movie was not full of blood or gore as you might expect from low budget movies. The movie is known as 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. Superbly directed by Tobe Hooper, this horror flick will send chills down your spine. Starring Gunnar Hansen as the maniac human cannibal, you will find yourself enthralled in the movie which was banned in over 5 countries and was only recently awarded a certificate in the UK. When I bought 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' on DVD I felt it was money well spent. You feel like you're in the movie, being chased through the woods with a maniac in a mask chasing. This may sound riciculous but the concept is not entirely proposterous. Toobe Hooper was originally shooting for...get this...a PG rating!!! Yes, good enjoyable wholesome entertainment for the whole family. Granny watching Leathface cut teenagers into pieces with a chainsaw in between knitting you a new jumper. Yes, what a lovely film for all generations. Brr...woof! No, somehow I don't think this would pass as a PG, eventually it was given an R rating in the US and 18 in the UK (after it was banned). You get the feeling like this sort of thing could happen, and indeed it has. The movie is based on the exploits of Ed Gein who cut up his victims and ate them. The DVD itself is very cool. Excellent extras including commentry by Toobe Hooper and Gunnar Hansen, this is a movie which you will keep coming back to again and again. Buy! Buy you fools!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as I'd thought...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film about twenty years ago and have carried the thought that it was a total piece of crap with me for some years (actually all of these years). Being a student of film these days led me to give it another viewing when I'd recently had the chance, and I have to recant my earlier opinion for sure.First off, this isn't any Hollywood glitzy, glam flick. It comes from an era just more recently visited in independent cinema, in which at least some effort was made to "be real." This is not to short the fantastic hundred million dollar productions the industry puts out on occasion. They have their place and some technically intense works could not be done without a lot of money (outrageous salaries notwithstanding).Not only are the characters "real" in this, they are just plain screwed up, and scary. While people like these are few and far between (thankfully) they do exist and are more readily found than those we find in Mission Impossible, for example.Some viewers have faulted the characters as bombastic and I'd have to disagree in that they were totally believable, though fantastic for sure. I don't feel it's a realistic expectation to believe the female lead should have hidden in the underbrush as someone suggested. That's something a person who is cool and collected under pressure might do, but not anyone crapping their pants, not anyone I'm sure any of us might know when being chased by a freak with a chainsaw.This won't go down as my favorite flick for sure, but it's better than the dung heap I thought it was. Original, scary, real, and a trip straight back to the hippie days. Dig those tight bell-bottoms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Night-time Visions of Very Bad Things... (may contain spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people say this film is the greatest horror film ever made. I don't believe I can agree with that, but it is without question a trend setter in the field. While the plot itself leaves a lot to be desired, and the characters aren't developed very well, this film brings a lot to the table. Without an enormous budget, and with very few special effects at their disposal, Toby Hooper and his crew were left to their own devices. They did very well with what they had, believe me. This movie explodes out of the gates, and it never lets up. It's as intense as they come, and it was genuinely frightening.I've heard it said that the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is almost like a documentary, and that much is certainly true. This film is a certifiable trip into a deranged and macabre surreality that lingers even after the credits have rolled. This film really plays with the mind, relying on creative psychological film making to provides its chills. So much of the action takes place in almost tangible darkness; the woods through which Marilyn Burns flees her demented pursuer Leatherface were thick and tangled. At times, the only light came from the full moon above. Even the name, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, has an impact, drawing disturbing ideas to mind that, combined with the sounds and camera angles convince you to see things the film makers weren't able to put on camera. Because of the name, most people believe this film to be much more violent than it actually was. Here's to making what you've got work for you.The film itself was a bit grainy, a little dated by time, but I think that makes it seem all the more real, and the dvd contains one of the best commentary tracks currently available. This film is definately worth owning, especially if your a fan of horror, but visit the sequels at your own risk. I don't think this is the greatest horror movie of all time, but it is definately a cornerstone of the genre, and without our good buddy Leatherface, there may never have been a Jason or a Freddy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film really is good, maybe not in the way of oscar winning acting, or superb special effects.When you go and see a film, i think there is a certain THING that you want, and each film genre fulfils a different part. For instance people watch action films to be entertained, and Drams to feel emotional. By the same vain i believe people watch horror films to be scared, and feel uncomfortable.Todays hollywood "sugar coated" horror films are just not the same. Take scream, its a comedy, that makes you jump, and at the end the bad guy is caught/dies whatever, its all the same, played for the dollars.REAL horror is about making you question if what you are seing could happen, it makes you think and stays with you long after you leave your seat. It makes you lie in bed, thinking about the film and turn your light on.The most effective psychological horror films are Exorcst and Psycho for this reason. These mess with your mind, the film doesn't scare you AS MUCH as leaving the cinema and thinking about it.TCSM goes the other way, there is no or little subtlety, but no one is safe, disabled man? Chainsawed. Preety girl? put on a meathook. With no character development at all, people feel for the charecters anyway through the power of the scenes. People could cry at sorrow with this film, and it always enters my mind when i see houses in the middle of no where.Watch it, and think about it.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing! (contains spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film really did take my breath away. Being 17 when i saw it last year on channel4 in Britain, and also being male doesn't seem to make it easier telling your friends you were scared by a movie. But when one of those friends agrees with you and you realise you're not the only one to think it, it does help.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is truly THE most frightening film i have ever seen. I usually tend to be a fan of the horror genre, in fact The Shining is my favourite film of all time, but no film i have seen since the Texas Chainsaw Massacre has ever been good enough in creating the same impact and shock upon me. When discussing it with people of a similar age what they thought of the film, most responses thought it was a lousy film and was funny in parts. As a generalisation (and i know this isnt always the case) it seems a lot of people who think that the film isnt anywhere scary at all, do not know it was actually based on fact. When i told some of my friends this (they didn't know) they changed their minds slightly about the film.This is the main feature when watching this movie is that knowing its based on fact, you can't help but feel for the characters. Sure, you know they are being played by actors and aren't actually being brutally murdered, however you can't help being reminded in your mind that most of the gruesome scenes which are shown has actually happened to someone.There truly are disturbing murders shown and what becomes of the corpses, but this film's title shouldn't be taken too literally! - there is only one person shown that is actually killed by a chainsaw, however not every film is true to the title and you do also get the hint the main murderer - Leatherface (who wears a mask of human skin) does kill regularly with his chainsaw. Probably one of the worst scenes that i remember in this film is of the murder of the first girl; having attempted to run away from leatherface, she is grabbed by him and dragged into the slaughter room, where her live body is hung on a meat hook, while in front of her we see Leatherface working on the dead body of her boyfriend - mutilating it with the chainsaw. This is just one example of many in the film where in breaks through the boundary's of conventional horror.Marilyn Burns cannot be corrected for her brilliant acting and realism, when she plays the tortured survivor Sally Hardesty. Having had her four other friends murdered by the disturbingly psychotic Leatherface, she becomes the only one to survive but has to endure an unbelievable torture by Leatherface's family of psychopaths.This, is another part of the film in which you really feel for the character. Having been chased a long distance by Leatherface and his chainsaw, she finally comes to a man who appears she is safe with, only to find out he is part of the disturbing family and captures her, where she is being skinned at the dinner table. Marilyn Burns plays on your emotions even more by the constant screaming, to which no one can hear (thus needing the tagline from Aliens - In Texas, no one can hear you scream). An effective use of the camera also helps to sink more fear into you. A close-up of her eye, which is moving all the time and staring completely helps to show us how she feels, in a way it puts us in her situation, feeling her fear. A point-of-view shot in the same scene also does this, showing us the table with the family around and the youngest member mimicking her cries as he goes on to torture her. It is only by a careless moment by this person that lets her escape, but even then it isn't over. When she runs out of the house, Leatherface is soon to follow her, chasing with the chainsaw again. What perhaps is also disturbing in this outside shot, is that we can tell it is now daylight, having been captured in the dark night before. So we can only imagine just how long she has been in there, being tortured.From the moment the horror starts, it never stops in this film until the end. This was a low-budget film, but was a high budget required? the answer is no. This film is a slasher-movie being propelled to its most potential in shocking you...and it works.If you think this film is rubbish, that is your choice. I recommend this film to all die-hard horror fans, like myself (as i mentioned) but dont expect it to be similar to horror films you have already seen. If you have seen similar movies - they are most likely made after 1974.Great film, shocking, powerful and disturbing but a great film. This is not for the easily disturbed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was general curiosity that first attracted me to watch this film. I had heard that it had been banned when it was made and it was this, coupled with all the hype that made me hire it out from the local video shop. My god, I was not disappointed!. It's plain and easy to see why this film achieved cult status, I have seen many many horror flicks but this one, although it didn't scare the pants off me, did shock me with a few scenes.The present day audience would have been subjected to this horror if this movie had been made in the late 90's. Viewers now have become so much more desensitised to this kind of thing and this is probably why the ban on this film was lifted. The desensitisation essentially comes from films such as 'Friday the 13th', 'Halloween' &amp; the Freddy films.It is really slow moving at first and I was wondering and waiting for this film to kick in and it certainly does that!. It's shocking to see this 'family' in action towards the end of the movie when they have captured that young attractive girl and they are sitting around the table. I guess the most disturbing section for me was 'grandpa', a man who looked like he had been born back in the dark ages. His grandsons were placing that weapon in his hand so that he could murder once again. Hmmmmm quite sick.If you are a major horror fan then this one is a must.Rating 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I may as well start out with the minor flaws. First of all, make sure you have your TV all the way bright, and the contrast way up. If you don't, you're sure to be annoyed by the film being 95% inky black. This 'dark' convention works excellently for the movie, but it seems slightly overused. Secondly, you run into a sort of mindless plot, although this is the most gripping mindless plot I've seen. And as for the victims, well, I'm sure hippies would chase them with chainsaws too, because man, the victims give hippies a bad name. On the upside, TCSM is filled with truly great horror scenes. A MUST SEE movie, folks, if you're a real horror fan!</fullReview>

So many movies have seen this and pretty much copied it. Friday the 13th - TCM with a hockey mask and a big knife, Nightmare on Elm st. - TCM with a claw, and dreams, Halloween - TCM with a knife and Capt.

		<fullReview>Texas Chainsaw Massacre is gripping, from the opening scenes it grabs your mind and doesn't let go until the very end. The cinematography is stunning and goes hand in hand with Tobe Hooper's direction. It does a great job of dehumanising the killers and drags you into a world where our morals and social laws mean nothing, the acting is amazing and leaves you feeling confused as to how the family ended up this way, the film builds up the characters in such a way. Marilyn Burns performance is unsettling at times and you hope that she can get out of this nightmare or even just hope that it stops as she begs for them to kill her. I feel that this film does what a good film should always do and leaves the film running in your mind long after the actual film ends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hmmm.... where do I start? Well, point black, this movie is a classic, and In My Opinion... it is The Horror Movie To End Them All.Simple story and plot. Five friends take a drive in the rural Texas area. Hearing of grave robbings on the radio, they investigate their grandfather's grave. Hours pass, and gas is gone. They stumble upon their old abondoned grandfather's house. Very near, Leatherface is waiting.What makes this movie so different I think is the cast. The cast is very unknown, which I think, makes the movie more realistic. I also think the musical "score" is divine and genius. The setting is unrealisitc. Basically, this movie is awesome. And even though there arent any "pop-out" scenes where Leatherface scares us half to death, there is a great amount of realistic terror which unsettles every viewer. Tobe Hoopper is awesome, well only with this and "poltergeist".I remeber the first time i saw this, i was only 10, and i had to stop it when Pam met her deminsice. But i finally had the balls to view it in its entirety. Now i own it on dvd. haha..This is a serious must for all horror fans, yet i don't know one person that likes horror that never seen this movie.Next time, get together with your friends, get drunk and high, and watch this film. Like the trailer says... "This movie is positivley ruthless in its attempt to drive you right out of your mind."</fullReview>

It's one of a very small handful of films that present a unique, completely radical view of the world; it's harsh, unforgiving and totally memorable, and by God, once it sets its teeth in you, you stay bit. Just the set design/"decoration" alone would be enough to make this movie stick in your mind; image after unforgettable image whacks you round the chops, to say nothing of the extraordinary, semiamateur performances. Forget the wave of unwatchable crap that came steaming in its wake - the Massacre is the original, and still the best drive-in horror show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of the horror films I've seen, only Night of the Living Dead is really comparable to this one. Although the two films have nothing in common in terms of plot, genre devices (cannibal zombies versus backwoods freaks), or pacing, they share a crucial thing: For different reasons, each feels like a nightmare captured on film.There's a fair amount of black humor in Chainsaw, though the film takes itself utterly seriously. As others have remarked, the movie has less gore than even Psycho, achieving its power through suggestion and some amazing performances by the amateur cast.Due to the lurid title and posters, you may have some unrealistic expectations about Chainsaw. This isn't Faces of Death. With a group, a six pack, and the lights on, you can laugh your way through it (I daresay that'll still be tough in the final ten minutes). But try watching it alone after midnight, and see how well you sleep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this film it was a scratchy third-hand version, and that "griminess" only enhanced the incredible realism (?!) of this movie. Most films get hung-up on pointless storytelling and plot devices that feel so unreal that they inhibit any resulting thrills - but not this movie! In the documentary now available with some copies, one of the crew says "THIS MOVIE HAS HOMOCIDE ON THE BRAIN!" and that about sums it up. And it's so refreshing not to see the creepy, fetishistic, unconvincing high-IQ killers that we get in Silence of the Lambs et al. Equally, we don't suffer here from the drive to humanise/explain murderers that we get in Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer etc. The fun of this movie in particular stems from the sheer inadequacy of the victims to escape the simplistic rage of the killers (if the police got involved, the murderers would be rounded up easily!) - plus, the proximity of a slaughterhouse to the murders gives a message of humans literally being like cattle to the slaughter (a message that secretly amuses animal liberation guys like me!).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The DVD is indeed somewhat dark, and does not do justice to the original. The VHS versions are slightly better, but really, to appreciate this epic voyage into terror you need to get hold of a 16 or 35mm film print, and see just how the Director meant the scenes inside the house to be seen. The originals are not very dark like the re-mastering versions and you can see ALL details,very important for some scenes. I found the DVD largely very poor and was obviously taken from a dark or incorrectly exposed print.Prints of TCM come up from time to time on auction sites, and are well worth the cash. Even 16mm prints shows far more detail than the compressed digital DVD version. The only advantage in DVD is the soundtrack will be better, unlike the optical and usually scratchy track on 16mm film.</fullReview>

The DVD of this film is excellent, the restoration of picture and the audio commentary from Tobe Hooper, Gunnar Hansen and David, as well as many of the other features, they're all awesome. However, the house interior shots on the restored version are a bit dark, they lose the VHS masters quality of weirdness a bit, so check that out if you haven't seen it.

		<fullReview>Few films in existence even today have the effect that TCM has left on millions upon millions of viewers. The feelings of anxiety, curiosity, horror, empathy, and outright terror are extremely strong typically with first-time viewers. --and while the film can be a bit gross at times, it does not use much gore. Rather, it relies on the actual horror-aspects of multiple situations. (i.e., we get to see Leatherface impale a perfectly-healthy girl on a meathook-- but it doesn't stop there-- oh, no. Between her screams of agony behind clenched eyes-- her only reward for opening her eyes while enduring that pain is watching this enormous madman chopping-up her boyfriend's corpse-- and realizing that she is next.) All-in-all, the memorable quality behind TCM is its ability to chill one to the bone with the horrible situations. (and the remarkable facial-acting by Marilyn Burns (Sally Hardesty) is so believable that one tends to forget they're watching a movie, and are living this madness along with her.)This movie far surpasses the sequels-- which, to me, didn't even seem to care about the importance of the story to the people who loved it. I, personally, wanted to see what had happened to Sally Hardesty in TCM 2-- and have her heavily involved in the story line. But instead of following with a plausible story (like the original)-- TCM 2, 3, &amp; 4 went with humor factors, stupid plot lines, and bad acting.TCM was Tobe Hooper's "baby". He made it what it is today-- and no matter how bad any sequels might be-- no one can ever take away his masterpiece: the original Texas Chain Saw Massacre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre may not be the bloodiest movie ever, but is so unrelentingly downbeat (and well-made) it will not be ignored in film histories for years to come. From the opening narration (who would have thought John Laroquette could be so creepy?) to the final credits, every note is played with vulgar disonance. Everything is so WRONG about this movie- young people going somewhere in a van smacks of misdeeds in itself. Even the parts you may laugh at or think are goofy are also uneasily weird. There is something about travelling in rural areas (especially those as flat as Texas) that is frightening- it's like being in a wasteland of sorts- and for the young this is even more alien. The camera work and editing is very effective (the scene where the girl falls on the floor in the "chicken room" comes to mind), the production design is chilling (the sliding metal door and red wall behind it). You feel little to no sympathy for any of the victims- there is even something about some of their demises that is frighteningly humorous. But the last person alive at the end has gone through so much, you will find yourself cheering for her as she gives 100% to get away from these freaks. Not much else you can say about this movie. Definitely truth in advertising- the name says it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Terror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Up until a couple of years ago this film was infamous in Britain, it had mass cult value and status. It was ?the' banned movie. When it was finally re-released in 1999 after 25 years the audiences weren't that impressed. They said that it may have been able to shock all those years ago, but now it's just to dated. To these people I would like to say: `Bull'.This movie is as terrifying now as it was 25 years ago. What people don't seem to grasp is that the concept of this film is to make you think. To make you use your imagination. You think you're witnessing the most horrific and gory movies ever, but in fact your not. Hooper hardly shows you any blood or gore.The scariest part of this movie isn't contained in the movie itself. It's the fact that the character ?Leatherface' was actually based on a living person, Ed Gyne. Gyne was also used for ?inspiration' for the characters Norman Bates in Hitchcock's Psycho and Buffalo Bill in Demme's The Silence of the Lambs. Sends chills down your spine doesn't it? Knowing that someone that deranged really existed.Anyway enough with the history lesson let me tell you a little about the film. Undoubtedly you are aware of what is to occur in the movie, a group of teenagers away from home individually meet a killer (or chainsaw wielding maniac, whichever you prefer), and funnily enough get killed. Its textbook init? Although this is true, this isn't your average Michael Myers or Freddy Kruger movie.I'm not going to go into great depths and ruin the film for you but I have to say this is not a film for kids or the faint hearted.Marks out of 10 ? a perfect 10. This is an all time classic from Tobe Hooper, the definitive horror movie. But remember do not watch this alone.</fullReview>

A very stylish documentary style, which doesn't make the whole thing soft-core.The viewing is very difficult, the movie seems to be real so it's shocking. I wouldn't say it's a bad movie but i didn't enjoy not one second of it! It didn't want to be like BRAINDEAD, it had something very real, not a comic-book style and no sense of humor. So it wouldn't reccomend it to anyone who isn't mature(i am 14 years old for example and you see how shocked i was). The direction is good, the performances are very shocking and impressive(especially the girl's who survived in the end). I also heard that the blood in the last survivor(the girl) is real!! There is no comparison between this one the BLAIR WITCH PROJECT at all... I gave this a 6, it should be watched with an open mind...</fullReview>

Needless to say, this is a classic. No self-respecting horror fan would go without the experience... Not to mention the subtext comment on abbatoirs, and animal cruelty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before my buddy Jay first showed me this movie, he warned me that it was made in the seventies, and could I please disregard it's age. I assured him I'd be fine and he rolled the tape. And, to be truthful, if you look past the age and obvious cheapness of the movie, it was actually a great piece of work. Gunner Hanson (Jay will kill me if I spell this wrong) does a wonderful job playing Leatherface (who, by the way, is the COOLEST villain EVERRRRRRR), pardon my bad memory, but I can't remember anyone else from the movie, but the rest of the cast was actually great.

		<shortDescription>Packed Terror Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Texas Chainsaw Massacre is another movie of the long lines of classics from its decade. The movie is about a group of young students who, while visiting their grandfathers grave, stumble upon an abondoned out-house. What they don't realize is that a family of cannibalistic psychos live there, and are terrorized one by one by the "leader" of the pack, Leatherface.That said, TCM ranks as one of the scariest movies ever. There is almost no soundtrack or budget for the film, which makes it seem extremely real. One scene especially(*spoilers up ahead*) which illustrates that is when one of the characters steps into a room full of bones, animal skins and a grotesque animal. It is absolutely horrifying to say the least. The suspense of the movie moves at a very quick rate, giving you(and the characters) no time to breath. Not much gore, but plenty of scares and thrills the whole way through(similar to "Psycho", "Halloween" exc..) Acting is standard for this type of film. Also, I found it amazing that the heroine of the film(Sally) made it through that torture inside the house. She had almost everything thrown and used against her(chainsaw, switchblade, broomstick, branches exc..) Not to mention the fact she had to jump through two windows and almost got hit by 2 trucks!! The action is nonstop. 8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who will survive and what will be left of them?These words apply as much to the audience as to the events portrayed in this film. I remember watching this movie for the first time. I was six years old and my father had come home with the first movie he'd ever rented to play on our brand new Betamax. At this point I'd already seen screamer classics like "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th". I had grown up watching these movies. I had no idea the depths of terror that could be unveiled. You have to remember, this was before all the mega-gore splatter-fests churned out for the straight to video market (hell, there was no straight to video market). This was fresh and original. Up unto this point, there were things you just didn't show...(like gruesome dismemberments and graphic depictions of heads being caved in)...but it wasn't just the graphic depictions of violence that made this a classic, it was the terror. The terror of madmen seen in their natural habitat, the fact that something like this could happen. You can't say that the first time you saw this movie and heard the opening voice-over about the events being seen here are actual events and not just feel chilled afterwords. This is a landmark film in the horror genre...even if you didn't like it, there is no way you can deny it's effect on all horror films made after it was released. This is one of the definitive films of modern horror...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you don't find anything good about Texas Chainsaw Massacre then you may not be that familiar to the genre.Especially considering that this movie was made way back in 1974 and standards were different back then. It's grainy appearance and tripping sound-effects combined with shaky camera-movements and not to forget the gruesome 20 minute dinnertable-sequence makes it a disturbing watch. It's sad to hear people moaning about the lack of gore while subtlety proves sometimes to be more effective. This is one of the alltime best made horrormovies you will come across exploring the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who will survive and what will be left of them?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to comment not only on the movie itself, but also on the new Collector's Edition DVD. I usually don't do this in IMDB reviews, but I was so impressed I wanted to in this case.If you want a short summary, here it is. Excellent movie, excellent DVD, excellent special features.First, the movie. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is probably one of the scariest movies ever made (and one of the best titles of all time). Man, they made some creepy movies in the 70's (Carrie, The Exorcist, Rabid). It was unique for its time, and there's still nothing quite like it today. The plot doesn't sound like much- 2 women and 3 men make a drive to rural Texas to check out a graveyard that has been 'defiled', and to also relax and enjoy themselves. This last part of their vacation plan doesn't go real smoothly, as they make the mistake of wandering into an area where an insane, backwoods, inbred, cannibalistic sociopathic family live. Things get more and more horrifying from there.I've heard people complain this movie isn't scary and not gory enough. Well, as far as the gore, it is fairly low-key by today's standards (though I'm sure my mother wouldn't want to watch it, and it couldn't be shown uncut on regular network TV). There's not a lot of blood till the end of the movie, but the acting is so good, and the screams of the victims so wrenching, your imagination fills in the rest and it actually is painful to watch. I will agree that the movie is kind of slow to get started- I admit the first time I saw it as a teenager I was getting impatient for some action. However, the last half of the movie more than makes up for it. But if you think this movie isn't scary, I seriously doubt you've watched alone, at home, at night, with all the lights off. The first time I saw it was in the daytime, and it still made my hair stand on end. When I got the Special Edition DVD (more on that later)I unwisely watched it after midnight with the lights off, after my husband went to bed. That night, I couldn't sleep until the sun came up. The opening scene of the rotting corpse in the cemetery wired to a headstone alone made my skin crawl. The scene where Pam first discovers Leatherface's room, with the furniture made of bones and the chickens in bird-cages, gets scarier each time I see it. The last 20 minutes, at the dinner table, has to be one of the most grueling and realistic scenes ever. The final few images-the crazy laughter and the spinning-well, over 10 years went by between the last time I saw the movie and the time I watched it on DVD a few weeks ago, and I *still* could remember those shots so vividly it was like I saw it yesterday.The DVD is incredible-the transfer is so crisp that it seems like the movie was filmed last year instead of in the early 70's. Since I'd only seen it on VHS, I never really appreciated how beautiful some shots of the rural setting are, and also how well-thought out and carefully put together most of the cinematography is. Breathtaking, actually. Until the commentary pointed it out, I never realized how perfect and effective the long, continuous shot of Pam hesitantly getting up off the porch swing to try to find out where her boyfriend has gotten to and slowly walking to the screen door is. This movie does not look at all amateurish, even though it was made on an extremely low budget.The DVD is packed with cool and interesting special features. First, the commentary by Tobe Hooper, Gunnar Hansen aka Leatherface, and director of photography Daniel Pearl is fascinating. There's lots of subtle but powerful elements in the movie I missed till now-for instance, the lack of almost any score or soundtrack that gives it a documentary feel, making it that much more disturbing. Hardcore fans of this movie know already this was NOT an easy shoot by any standards, but their accounts of how much energy and work it took to get certain things right, not to mention the really tortuous things many of the actors went through...well, if any actor deserves to be paid millions for a movie, this cast certainly earned it. The dinner scene was the most horrendous- they could only do one take, since the actor playing Grandpa decided he would only give them one day, it went on for 20+ hours, and this was in 110 degree heat with no air conditioning. Gunnar Hansen said that by the end, he was so out of it he started to think he wasn't acting. Kind of gives the tagline "Who will survive and what will be left of them?" a whole new meaning.There's also some deleted and alternate scenes; nothing mind-blowing but still very interesting. With many of them, you can read the script excerpt of the scene first. There's a hilarious blooper reel-the quality isn't that great, but you'll laugh your butt off. There's lots of production notes and stills, along with shots of rare publicity material. A couple scenes are broken down shot by shot, with Hooper explaining why he made the directing and editing choices he did. There's even more, I just don't have room for it all. The menu is also pretty great-if you let it sit too long though, you'll get a brief surprise that'll make you jump. I was quietly paging through the booklet at the time and it scared the bejeezus outta me. I highly recommend the Special Edition to anyone who is a fan of TCM. You'll be able to spend hours enjoying it, and they couldn't have done a better job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe I'm getting old, maybe I'm getting soft, maybe I'm not as jaded as I would like to be or maybe I'm just not as desensitized as I'd always hoped. But damn, people, damn... I saw this film for the first time mere weeks ago and for a day I decided that eating was a really really bad idea. Yes, the effects are of the typical run of the mill "it's 1974 and we don't have any money" calibre. Yes, the acting is over the top. The camera, I have to say, though, is very sly, the sound work is nothing short of fantastic purely in its effectiveness, and for such a cheap movie the work put into this film is phenomenal. And it pays off. While the movie isn't, as some would assert, based on an actual occurrence, it is based partially on the practices of Ed Geins (a la Psycho) and by mere virtue of that fact it taps a nerve somewhere inside that says that we humans are capable of some sick things (and I have to give the film credit for being so covertly pro-vegetarianism... the idea that within the reality Hooper creates the meat eaters are ruthless barbarians is such a clever little stab at our factory farming economy). Oh, shucks, no gore... and to some of the more, yeah, jaded viewers this is a pretty hokey movie. In the last analysis, though, when a film can scare you with its brutality, its psychosis, or by its clever little suggestions, its done a damn fine job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blood and Gore Hardly win</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning might contain some spoilers:I believe that when it comes to making a great horror film,blood and gore hardly win.A good horror movie is one that can tap into your subconciuos.One that can create images so frightning that they will stay locked in your memory for a while.To consider such movies as Scream,I know what you did last summer and Urban legends great films would be crazy.I rather have the haunting visuals then the blood,I've seen more scary things in a Marilyn Manson video then what is presented these days.That is why I believe the best decade of horror was the 70's.When such great horror classics as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,The Exorcist,The Omen,and Halloween came out.Now with that point in hand.Let me get straight to the point.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has to be one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen.Some of the visuals are just plain scary and the whole phschological factor to it is remarkable.First of all I can't understand where the myth of this movie being bloody and gorey came out and another thing that I can't understand is how this movie was banned in England.This movie can be a good case study for a phschology class.I won't explain the story because basically anyone who has read other comments will know it already.All I have to say is that the dinner table scene is truly a classic scene in the whole horror genre.The extreme close ups of Sally's eyes as she is screaming in fear is just remarkable.The ending was also great,in where we see leatherface whirling the chainsaw around.That room with all the bones was also freaky and it created a disturbing visual.To me the movie will always be a horror classic,just a word of advice try to watch this movie in the dark and preferably alone.It will give off a better effect that way.I have to give this movie a 7.5 out of 10.Some of the dialouge could have been better,but other then that this movie is a horror classic.</fullReview>

I mean there's a homosexual, chainsaw-wielding maniac chasing young teens through the woods. How many times have you seen that on film? huh? Probably not many.The story begins when Sally Hardesty (Marilyn Burns), Her invalid brother Franklin (Paul A. Partain) and a group of 3 other friends go to investigate a possible robbery of their grandfather's grave. On the way back, they stop for a hitchhiker who is stranded on the side of the road, and the hitchhiker eventually leads them to his family...And at which point I'm not going to tell you any more.So, If you're a fan a freaky stuff, check this out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i love horror films, especially classic ones. toby hooper's tcm is a modern cult classic. shown with little actual gore and more head psych, toby brings us into the world of the free and insane. a family of probably inbred and wacked out lost craftsmen live in the "outback" of texas. there is the assumption that they were left behind when the town's slaughterhouse was closed (along with the town it seems). left without their psychological outlet they turn to slaughtering anything within walking distance.filmed as all great horror films are with little budget, no-name actors, and gruelling hours to get it "into the can" as quick as possible; it gives the feel of someone really walking around filming a real psycho family without their knowlege.i've seen comments on here bending towards the negative. and usually they are also not horror fans. well, that makes sense that they didn't like it or "get it". this is the ultimate in horror. night of the living dead gave us a socio-political thought engine, texas cs massicre gave us pure psychopathic eye candy! love it or leave it, tcm is the quintesential gore film from which all others were born.footnote: i just saw the "family portrait" last night (rented it) and i wish that the dvd people would have added that on the dvd. the vhs version is so old, it's almost unwatchable. maybe there will be a special 30 year anniversary dvd with that added on (hint, hint!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen the Texas Chain Saw Massacre before and believe that it is truly one of the best horror movies of all time. This movie had a very small budget, unknown actors, no soundtrack, a first time director and a cinematographer fresh out of college. I believe that all of this helped make this movie great, give it that low-budget, realistic feel. I don't think it would have been as effective or scary if you took the same script and had a large budget. Anyway, last night it came on IFC and I decided to watch it and discovered that the movie had almost no sound but rather commentary from director Tobe Hooper, cinematographer Daniel Pearl and Gunnar Hansen who played Leatherface. It was very interesting and very informative. I'm not sure when they shot this but supposedly it was the first time the 3 of them had been together since they shot the movie in '73. SPOILER: The best part was when they described the diner scene. The grandfather was actually a thin 18 year old kid who spent 10 hours in makeup and decided this was it, shoot it all now b/c he wasn't doing this again. Thus, they shot for like 27 hours straight in this room which they said was in excess of 100 degrees. The whole movie was shot in extremely hot temperatures and Gunnar or Leatherface only had one shirt, so he basically had to wear the same shirt for 4 weeks, thus he really smelled. It was so hot during the diner scene that many of them were vomiting and they had to take numerous breaks to get fresh air. Gunnar said that he and the rest of the cast basically got so hot and tired that they went a little crazy and he actually believed he was Leatherface. There is a scene where he cuts Sally's finger and puts it in the old man's mouth. They did this shot over and over b/c the pump attached to the knife kept getting stuck and wouldn't squirt any blood so Gunnar said he finally just took the tape off the knife and actually cut her finger b/c he was basically nuts by this point and wanted the scene to end. Tobe said Sally was excellent and really took a lot of abuse physically but was really committed to the part. So if you go back and watch this movie check out this particular scene b/c they said there wasn't a whole lot of acting go on in there, these "actors" were literally going insane and it really makes for a strong, disturbing, climatic performance.They also went into detail about a lot of the shots Daniel and Tobe experimented with such as the shot of the character Pam who is in the swing outside the brother's house and as she gets up to go into the house the camera comes up behind her from under the swing. This particular shot was not in the original script so Daniel and Tobe really had to put their feet down and threaten to walk out if it wasn't included. They really did an excellent job, I mean both of these guys were young and had never done anything like this before and their experimentation really payed off.If you really like this movie, I highly recommend checking this out although I'm not real sure where you could find it, maybe contact IFC - Independent Film Channel. If you don't think much of this movie, then you might also like this b/c it really gives you feel for the whole movie making process and what these people had to go through to get what you finally see on the big screen. I rank this movie up there with the Exorcist, The Shining, Halloween, Psycho, Scream and The Event Horizon as my favorite scary movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THIS is what a horror movie should be!Texas Chainsaw Massacare is so frightening because the entire premise is extremely realistic: a group of young people decide to go to a rural area of Texas, then are brutally chopped up and murdered by a local serial killer. The villains in the film are by no means supernatural, as is usually the trend in horror fodder. There is suspense throughout the film; we care about each of the characters; the murders are gruesome (though not gratuitously gory), and once again, we feel the tension throughout.SPOILER: Some utterly terrifying and unsettling scenes that will have the viewer feeling uncomfortable are the infamous dinner table scene, which contains so many bizarre cuts that you actually WANT the potential victim to die just so that the scene will end. Another scene is when the same victim is being chased throughout the forest, in which the only sounds heard are branches breaking, screaming, and the incessantly loud drone of a chainsaw. The film is so striking because it contains no soundtrack, thereby adding to the tension of the film.This film is a must-see for a horror fan buff. It is one of the few genuinely scary films in the horror genre.8 out of 10</fullReview>

This movie is considered by some to be the original slasher movie, but I think that there's more to it than that. Sure, there's an insane, chain-saw wielding, human-skin masked, cannibalistic killer chasing an innocent teen girl, but the movie actually has a point. There is a lot in this movie that has to do with cows, and the cattle industry. I think this movie is turning the tables on humans and making us the prey. It obviously an anti-beef industry movie.

		<fullReview>October,1974.A movie about five young adults terrorized by a family of cannibals shocked the hell out of moviegoers.No one could ever imagine the horror that would come from the mind of director Tobe Hooper. The movie,inspired by the events of Ed Guin,was no ordinary film at the time of it's release. People even walked out of the trailers for the film.To make a movie that relies not just on gore but also reminds us that we are living in a society of violence,well let me give this film an A. Although the film is very graphic,we can't help but asking ourselves why do these bad things happen.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is on my list as one of the best horrorfilms of the 1970s.This film is also scary because of it's documentary film style. Sure,it's only a movie.But it's a movie that will remain the kind of film that will alwaysremind us that fear is all around us.For that I think TheTexas Chainsaw Massacre will be a movie that will remain one of my favorites.Disturbing and graphic but at least Tobe Hooper had the guts to make this film.</fullReview>

It was genuinely scary, though in the end, it was almost sadistic. TCM is alot like Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes, but it's even more gruesome. Leatherface was scary, as was the hole family, and the girl was very pretty, before she started screaming all the time. Well, nothing very intelligent to say about the film... you have to see it yourself. I saw it on R2 DVD Special Edition, which has great image and sound quality + Tobe Hoopers commentary track, and lot's of deleted scenes, which I have yet to see.

		<fullReview>Known as the granddaddy of all horror films, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a non-stop, heart-pounding, bizarre-as-hell horror legend, that delivers a great gritty picture quality and a cannibalistic Brady Bunch. One of the original modern-day slasher films was first witnessed by these eyes, as a not-so-gory but suspenseful, bizarre ride into the very realistic world of Leatherface and company. This may be one of the first slasher films to start with unsuspecting nubile teen-casts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliant social commentary! Once the killing begins, Five victims are quickly winnowed down to Sally, who runs screaming from one torturous situation to the next. This film take place in cattle country and, early on, we are shown a montage of cattle waiting unaware for their turn to be slaughtered. Eyes bulging, and mouths dripping with saliva as they stand uneasily in the heat. These scenes are echoed throughout by multiple shots of Sally's bulging eyes and screaming mouth. This film is an obvious commentary on the inhumane nature of the beef-cattle industry. It succeeds by creating an allegory in which humans are suddenly thrust into the role of cattle. I'm not a vegetarian, but this film makes me think that I ought to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the difference between this and other horror movie titles is that the film is presented documentary style.this makes for chilling viewing and the fact that it was made on a small budget meant that the use of an unknown cast accentuated the realism.as in most horror classics,suspense,creepiness and eerie camera shots are used to create the chills.this film must have been an obvious inspiration for the blair witch project.movies like this influences the genre and rekindles interest in horror movies.everybody likes a good scare and classic horror movies such as this satisfies this desire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is nothing special. But it does however have an interesting plot and has some pretty scary moments. The movie plays with your head in some ways as well. The camera angels and the music really make you stick to your seat and watch (sometimes in horror) at the events that take place. You sometimes feel what the actress in the movie is feeling whether its relief that she got away or the terror of what she is seeing. This is a cult classic but its nothing really special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE SCARIEST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. The title pretty much says it all, but the movie itself does all the explaining.Tobe Hooper put forth this bone-chilling, mind-opening masterpiece that, to this day, still scares the s*** out of me. I watched this movie with an open mind very recently late one night, and I felt like I was eight years old again-when I first saw it-because I was a little hesitant to close my eyes. This movie captures that 'creepiness' that horror movies of today seriously lack. The mood, the musical score, and the overall darkness (figuratively and literally) of this film defines pure terror. It makes you imagine and wonder what happens to people when you don't know what really happened. The chase scene near the end almost seemed endless, with the constant screaming of Sally Hardesty and eerie buzzing of Leatherface's chainsaw in the dead of night(no pun intended).I agree that the sequels to TCM are inferior in terms of gore and sheer fright, but TCM2 just made me laugh. It was the FUNNIEST scariest movie I've ever...blah, blah.'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' is an eternal classic, and perhaps the true innovator of the slasher genre. I give it a ***** out of ***** on the Horror Scale. And to all of you '90s, Gen. X'ers out there who think that movies like 'Scream' and 'I Know What You Did...' are top-of-the-line horror flicks, I DARE you to watch this movie with the most open of minds, and tell me personally if you believe that this is REAL horror at its BEST!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fright fest that holds strong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Tobe Hooper brought us this low-budget chiller in the early 70's, and I'm guessing only true horror fans have actually seen it, and likely they will be the only ones who will want to. The film is jammed full of unrelenting terror and madness, with a twisted and sick feeling covering the film. The movie is a fantastic piece of classic horror that still manages to supply fright, with little gore and simply implied violence. What is truly scary is the set and atmosphere. The idea alone is just plain macabre. A family in rural Texas slaughters teens to supply barbecue for their local gas station. The film set the standard of horror "slasher" films, and is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. The film is definitely not for everyone though. If you love horror, see it today, you will not be disappointed. Others, steer clear of this film. It may be a brilliant flick, but you likely won't be able to handle the insanity.</fullReview>

This movie is definitely not a Hollywood-type of film.The director was very creative with the camera angles. My favorite angle was the close, close-ups of the victim's eyes. That angle just draws us in to the sheer terror that the victim was going though. It was very convincing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of films are scary. When I was young I was totally frightened after seeing Michael Myers in "Halloween" or watching Jack Nicholson becoming crazy in "The Shining". After I saw "Halloween" I remembered that I was afraid of having dreams and see Myers standing outside my bedroom window. I never had any bad dreams about him, but each night, a week after viewing, I really was afraid before going to bed.I still find the scenes in "The Shining" when little Danny drives around the corridors horrifying. And the scene where Jamie Lee Curtis looks out the window and see Myers hiding behind the laundry in "Halloween" must be one of the most chilling moments I've experienced in a movie.But if you for a moment forget Myers, Jack Torrance, Freddy, Jason and Pinhead and looks for the source in true horror... What will you think about? I can only name two horror movies before "Halloween" that really made a milestone in cinematic history. First we have "Psycho", made in 1960 and then we have the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", made in 1974. Of course there have been milestones before "Psycho", but not in the same kind of way."The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" really shook everything up. It has a reputation of being gruesome, but it doesn't show us much gore at all. Sure, this guy.. Leatherface chops up a couple of people, but we doesn't really see anything. The first time you see it you will probably (like me) think there will be bloody as hell, but you will soon realize that the horror doesn't lie in the blood... it lies in the mind of the story's sick family.There are two parts in this film. The first reaches until the moment when Mr. Sawyer lets Sally into the gas station after she's being chased by Leatherface. Up til that moment you haven't seen nothing yet. Now the second part starts and soon reveals the sick truth about the family she has met. I think the scene when actor Siedow is pecking her with the broom in the truck must be one of the most bizarre scenes ever... only to be beaten by the scene when Grandpa will show he's the best killer ever.You can't really grasp what you see. It's so totally disturbing and bizarre. Wayne Bell's music makes everything even more disturbing. Some times you don't know how to feel. Hooper shows us something that we, even in our wildest dreams, can't comprehend completely. You really starts wondering what goes on in Hooper and Kim Henkel's minds. The script is like nothing else.The actors are quite good. Siedow is perfect in his sick role and Burns is great doing a woman who experiences something so awful and twisted that it's impossible to know how the reaction of the character would be.Just like "Psycho" this movie doesn't end in ones mind after the last scene. You start thinking and after a while you realize that you just have seen one of the most horrifying movies ever. The first scene when Leatherface appears and closes the iron door is still the scariest scene in the whole movie. It's so sudden... surprising and out of nowhereTobe Hooper has made one the best horror movies of the century. I will always recommend it and even if the sequels aren't nearly as good as this one... I think you should see them also. Hooper made the first sequel where Siedow co-starred again and co-writer Henkel did the third sequel where Burns and Partain had smaller roles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A cat unexpectedly jumping from off camera is scary. But "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is so disturbing it will mess you up for months. Controversial and profane, based (like much of "Psycho") on the horrific ritual murders committed by Ed Gein, this film looks, feels and smells so much like a grainy, low budget documentary that it borders on snuff. It opens with a sober-voiced narrator detailing a heinous killing spree. Then we see the split-second flashbulb pops of crime scene carnage before finally meeting Leatherface - a deranged homicidal lunatic wearing a butcher's apron and a mask stitched out of human skin. The director, Tobe Hooper has said that when he settled on the films title he lost several friends. A copy of this movie resides in the Museum of Modern Art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece of Editing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's only one film this can really be compared to and that is the original version of the story of Ed Gein, Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece "Psycho." Much like "Psycho," "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" is edited to perfection, providing utmost horror and suspense with little gore and actual violence. The stories in both movies are amazingly similar, so much that Hooper's version could almost be considered a remake or at least retelling. Just like in "Psycho," characters travel one by one to a place they just shouldn't be. After one disappears, a few more go to find out what happened and disappear themselves. Like Norman Bates underwater automobile-graveyard, the deranged family in "Texas Chain Saw Massacre" have their own hidden yard full of vehicles that once belonged to their victims. Also like "Psycho" the quick-cut editing and use of music give the film much of its edge. The main difference between the two films lies in their intent. While "Psycho" shows the hidden horror behind an all-American, normal looking boy, "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" deals with a disillusioned family, stuck in the middle of an America that has no use for them anymore and just want a piece of humanity(literally). Both movies are multi-layered with various interpretations. Tobe Hooper meant the film to be a commentary on the psycho-schizophrenic Watergate era. Most people have a hard time seeing it that way, myself included.One parallel that for me is undeniable is that between Leatherface and Mrs. Bates. Most notably they are both men wearing women's clothes and makeup. Also, the first scene in "Psycho" where Mrs. Bates is seen in action as a private detective walks up the stairs towards her room and Leatherface's first onscreen appearance in "Texas Chain Saw Massacre" both gave me two of the biggest frights I've ever had, as the psycho in each film commits with cold, calculated precision an act of utter horror. This film is one of very few that can produce such a genuine chill, without the need for excess gore and blood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is the perfect horror movie! From the beginning to the end it keeps you in high tension and sometimes you feel like living a frightening, completely new experience. The first part of the film is disseminated by little clues that makes your pressure build up, while the second one is a total refreshing and cathartic explosion of terror and blood (though the violence is suggested more than widely showed). It doesn't take a lot of money to do a masterpiece and Tobe Hooper showed it. I'll never forget the mad characters of the film (in particular Leatherface and the grandpa) and the refined settings (above all the squalid house in which "the family" lives). If the horror movie of the 70's had only one voice, it would be Tobe's!</fullReview>

This is the kind of horror film that doesn't just scare you, it throttles you. Everything is done well here, from the camerawork to the lighting to the sound. But what I've always found most fascinating about this picture is how much you think you're seeing compared to how much you actually see. The first time I saw this film, I could have sworn that I saw that meathook go into that girl's back; but guess what, I didn't. I didn't actually see her boyfriend get cut up with the chainsaw or the kid in the wheelchair get eviscerated either, but it sure as hell felt like I did. It would be well worth one's time to view this film multiple times, since once the initial shock wears off, it becomes apparent just how tremendously well-made this film is</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As you watch and listen to the reading at the beginning of the film, the reader almost makes you turn it off with that voice he has and the way he pronounces 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.' When you first see Leatherface kill someone it seems to be no big deal, but when they show him hang that girl on the meat hook, and destroy her boyfriend with a chain saw, you may be disturbed, even though there is no blood. Another thing that makes this movie disturbing is when the hitchhiker comes, and also when the family eats dinner, and bring down "grandpa." It is disgusting when they cut her finger and suck her blood, and also when you see what the guy with the chain saw, aka Leatherface's mask is made of. It is human flesh sewn together. One thing that made parts of this movie stupid was when the guy hits the girl with the broom, and when he chases Leatherface and Leatherface's brother (the hitchhiker) around with the broom. The ending was kind of stupid, but this movie wasn't bad. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently saw Texas Chain Saw Massacre for the first time, and I was blown away! This must be one of the most surreal horror movies ever made, right up there with Cronenberg, perhaps even more weird than his movies. The beginning is a masterpiece of doom and dread. You almost fell trapped in this hot american landscape of redneks, corpses and slaughterhouses. In my view what makes this movie crawl under your skin, is the haunting uncomfortable sounds, which are supposed to be a soundtrack, and the trippy visuals( notice the recurring motif of the sun)which I don`t "get", but they still get me. I will never forget the extreme noise of a generator, in the middle of a peaceful landscape. Or the cracking sound of a hammer that hits a head. Or the sound of a chicken. Or the sight of a terrified screaming young girl at a "dinner party". Or the hitchhiker(weird folk music in the background) that cuts himself. Or... Or...No matter what you may have heard this is not a bad movie, it is in fact one of the greatest slasher movies ever made. No probably The Greatest slasher movie ever made (I don`t even like slasher movies, except for Hallowen!) 10 OUT OF 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THIS movie is the real classic. It works on your mind, your eyes, and your ears, and it does not let up until the end. And what a great ending it is!! The film ends out with Marilyn Burns (Sally) screaming and laughing her head off as she is taken away from the saw-wielding maniac in the back of the pick-up. The scariest scene is when Leatherface comes out of the darkness in the woods and saws up Sally's invalid brother. And even though nobody REALLY knows who Marilyn Burns is, I would rate her scream about a 15 out of 10. She screamed louder than Jamie Lee Curtis and made it sound far more relentless. Overall this movie is extremely disturbing and at the same time classical. It deserves far more credit than it gets and that is only because it is almost too close to home for most of its viewers. I rate it a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tobe Hooper's independent classic is one of the finest horror movies ever made. From early on, as the young protagonists find themselves being terrorized by the slaughterhouse geek, TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE presents us with a bleak tone of foreboding; we sense that they are fated to meet a violent end. The climactic ending, featuring the cannibal family terrorizing the one survivor who, just barely, gets away, masterfully brings the movie to closure. Throughout, the grainy cinematography and somber tone, along with the imagery of leatherface and his chainsaw, all add to the film's overall effectiveness. One thing about the period of the early 1970s, when this movie was made, which the van scene made me think of was that of youthful, naive student-types stumbling coming upon forces beyond their control. This was also the period in which hitchhiking came to be seen as a high risk behavior. I also think, at the risk of overanalysis, that the film's dark, rural location and depiction of nastily backward country folk suggest a kind of poetic take on the burgeoning political/cultural reactionary direction the U.S.A. was heading toward, i.e., the end of the "Age of Aquarius."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Long before the days of million dollar Hollywood special effects, horror movies walked along a line of suspense, shock, and sheer terror. This is exactly where we find the "Texas Chain Saw Massacre." When a group of college kids, away for the weekend, come across an old run down abandoned house, they unknowingly stumble into the territory of a murderous family of cannibals. This film, different from other films of its genre is unique for the reasons of the minimal gore and the daytime action. Most horror movies flood the screen with blood and guts. This is not true of the "Texas Chain Saw Massacre." There is very little blood and guts shown throughout this entire movie. Also horror films in recent years have kept the movie screen so dark that you can't tell who is about to get killed until you see their guts spray everywhere. On the contrary, a majority of the terror in this movie takes place in the light of day on a hot Texas afternoon. In all of its greatness however, this film is hardly an unflawed masterpiece. There is a selection of poor actors, as well as a lack of good cinematography. However, these minor blemishes do little to ruin a movie which will forever be an unforgoten classic. Anyone who ever sees this movie may never be able to hear a chain saw without conjuring a memory of the screeching voice and masked face of Leatherface. Undoubtedly, there are scenes within this film that will be etched in the fears of all who see it forever.</fullReview>

She told me about how she LOVED it. She said she was going to go looking for the REAL family. Which I later realized there was no real family, oh well. Anyways, I rented this movie and watched it with my sister in the dark.I was so happy. Then it came on, uh oh. Do not get me wrong, I LOVE THE MOVIE SO MUCH! But, you see, I live around a lot of woods. There is an old abandoned like house down the road. Now, I don't know wheteher to think "Blair Witch", or "Leather Face". Lord Knows I wont find out which is in that house. Maybe I'll find out later, but for right now I'm too scared shitless to find out. Well, this isn't too gory, but it is definetley freaky! Raw! And disturbing! It might of been wax in my ears, but the music reminded me of Walter Carlos's themes from "A Clockwork Orange". Those types of music scare the f*** outta me!! I like the Clockwork Orange music though.Anyways, It grows on you. It's like a classic. The "Citizen Kane", or "Gone With the Wind" oif horror. It is actually funny mostly. But then again, I'm demented. I gotta go now! Gotta go feed bruther and paw! Yehaw! (That was a joke)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror master piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its crude, scary, exciting, sick, its the Texas Chain Saw Massacre. This is not only a great horror movie but an impartial mirror of the mad society were living in. And its almost documentary style only makes it cruder. Its a must seen by any horror fan, and well if you're looking for a movie to get scared see this one. The importance of the movie is that it's based on something real so that makes it scarier. The photography on the film is pretty good and challenging and the scene of the eyes of sally crying injected in blood is just shocking. Tobe Hooper, as any horror fan may know is one of the best directors of this style, but this is really his master piece. The gore in this movie is not graphic, you know it is there but you never see it. And the atmosphere created by the sound editing, its excellent to create a tension state all along the movie. In resume this is an excellent horror movie that actually crossed the line between reality and fantasy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Along with Psycho and Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the big classics from horrors' true golden age. As most know it follows the story of a group of teens/twentysomethings who stumble upon a deranged family in rural Texas. Like most older horror films I saw this one as a kid. Back then it was scary but like most movies from that time it has lost some of its' impact over the years. Nonetheless, it's a classic and is routinely listed as just that on many a critics list. ET Weekly named it #2 on an all-time best horror movies list and Premiere has listed it as one of the most influential movies ever made. I'm shocked to see a 6.4 IMDB average rating here. Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a 10 all the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching this movie, and overall it was good. I was a little wary before watching it because two other big name horror films from this period (Halloween and The Last House on the Left) had really disappointed me. This one actually surprised me in the amount of gore it showed considering the time period it was made in. There are some truly disturbing scenes, especially when the hitchhiker is picked up. The acting is not always stellar, and Franklin especially got on my nerves with his terrible delivery of lines. Also, the film was obviously made on a low budget, and some of the special effects aren't too exciting, but still, for some reason it worked for me. The movie was almost ruined though when "grandpa" entered the scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget the 25-year anniversary of Nixon's resignation. The 25th anniversary of this film is a much better cause for celebration. It is as scary today as it was when it first came out in 1974. It is scary every single time you watch it, and I have seen it dozens of times. I've even had nightmares from time to time, dreaming that Leatherface is running after me with that chainsaw. Credit must go to director Tobe Hooper for making such an unforgettable movie with a low budget and minimal blood and gore. What is amazing is that people continue to contend that the movie is violent and gory beyond belief, even though some of these people have never even seen the film. It is the extreme suspense we feel before someone is killed that is actually more scary than the killing itself. The use of music and sound effects is outstanding. The movie maintains an incredible fever pitch during its final half hour that never lets up for a second. There are funny moments throughout, many coming from the paraplegic and the hitchhiker. I think the most memorable character in the film is the hitchhiker because he has more screen time than Leatherface and he contributes much of the film's hilarious dialogue. The actor who played the hitchhiker deserved an Oscar nomination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing and degrading! A classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, the movie is very gripping from the beginning to the end. The story focuses on an innocent group of friends that drive and fall upon a human slaughter house run by Leatherface. The movie has a horrible picture and it seems really cheap but this cheapness in the film made me feel uncomfortable and degrading. This movie's picture makes Halloween look like a fortune. The murders are not graphic and this movie's is surprisingly bloodless as it's reputed to be(by the smart critics). This movie is stuck on the idea of being frightened and the quick murders happen without the gory images. There are five characters so they are not really well developed (unlike Jamie Lee Curtis) and I thought I wouldn't care about the girl in the final chase. But Burns went through so much with the torture and the overlong chainsaw chase that I really felt for her. The movie is disturbing and they do a really cool filming with Marilyn Burns eyes. The movie was overall good and much more disturbing(but not as enjoyable) than halloween. However, the movie is so cheap that it brings you down to it's level, where as Halloween I sat with excitement watching the actions. I admitely did not enjoy watching the film but i had to give it a good rating because it bothered me like no horror film ever made. I praise Tobe Hooper for his degrading and disturbing creation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, what more there is to say about this film that hasn't been said before? This movie has got to be in the horror fans' consciousness as one of the all-time best horror films. If you haven't seen this film already, then you're probably not a big horror fan, 'cause this one's got all the classic elements: atmosphere, blood (although it isn't as gory as some people believe it is) and wonderful, horrific performances. Critics have said that what makes this movie so chilling is its attempt at being like a quasi-documentary, which renders the action more potent still. And I agree. If you're beginning your quest for good horror films, make sure to rent this one (the entire movie runs at 83min uncut). If you want to check other great movies by Tobe Hooper after this, I'd recommend Eaten Alive (little difficult to find), Poltergeist(very easy to find) and Lifeforce. Ahhh, and he made also a fabulous TV mini-series called Salem's Lot. So, there you go for some late night horror entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being from Texas myself, I watched intently to learn what people do in other parts of the state. This couldn't be about someone in "My Hometown". It was unbelievable and extremely impressionable. Watching this film in a drive-in also contributed to the horror. At this time, other films, such as "The Town that Dreaded Sundown" and "Small Town in Texas" were depicting Texas as a breeding ground for America's most wanted killers. The stereotype was not deserved, but killers have to come from somewhere! The film was horrifying and graphic! The weirdo family that kidnapped innocent victims and ate them, or used them for prize-winning barbeque recipes, was unspeakable. Watch this film, and dare yourself not to be suspicious of where your next lunch came from. The fright will choke you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic of the horror genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We lucky few in England have just had T.C.M. brought out on a limited theatrical release and I must start by saying it is a rather disturbing experience. I am totally cynical about the genre after years of watching third rate Hollywood rubbish, but this was truly a unique experience. After the first half an hour, brilliantly paced to install a false sense of security, the movie hits you like a sledgehammer. The first murder is undoubtedly disturbing and realistic, the gore is absent but the sheer shock is scary enough. From that point the relentless on slaught of the soundtrack is hard on the ears and only adds to the tension. The movie is certainly a critique of American family values and can be read as a very black comedy, but is certainly not an enjoyable experience. Overall, I believe I appreciated the film as a landmark in film horror. If this is the way the B.B.F.C is heading, then I am all for it. I would give the film 8/10 - see it to from your own opinions but put Jason and Freddy out of your minds!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well goodness me, this film is now an art movie. If you haven't got the patience for Pi - 'a study of...cabalistic mysticism' apparently - then rush along to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, a study of cannibalistic mysticism, without the mysticism. If you can't face hours of watching French Children getting lost in the snow, prepare to watch American college kids being cut up with chainsaws and made into sausages. All right ! This is what films are actually for.Well OK, but is it any good ? Unreservedly, yes. T.C.M. (as I'm sure we call it) lives in the same infamy as The Exorcist , both films are so bad for us that we shouldn't be permitted even to say their names out loud. Like The Exorcist however, most people will not have seen this picture because we're just not allowed. This correspondent remembers the film coming out in his native Limerick and all the hysterical hoo-ha in the papers. People were being carried out in fits, grown men were fainting, ladies were swooning. The implication was clear - see this film and you will become an evil, disturbed person and you'll probably go mad as well. Living in Limerick, the events portrayed in the film sounded rather common place to us, (a joke, don't write in) but be that as it may, I was too young and failed to see it. Seeing it now, one is blown away by the visual and aural invention. Large swathes of it look like an Art Film, the sound design is also smashing - a nervy collection of clicks and rustling cymbals. After a hilariously portentous narration, the title sequence consists of a series of arresting ruby images of the sun, followed by a shot of a dead aardvark, all very Wild Bunch. We then join the Scooby Doo like gang of youths in their Mystery Mobile on the way to oblivion. The acting is, of course, ropey, the quality of the stock ghastly and the dialogue often inaudible but this all adds to the creepy harshness of the atmosphere. One is, of course terribly familiar now with this scenario, but it is a relief to see an original version of the old machine, free of self-reference and irony.One's first sight of the chainsaw wielding Leatherface is a wonderfully icy moment, but also one rich with association. It's like seeing Rhett Butler or George Bailey for the first time, icons in their proper place and time - eternally young. Of course Leatherface is not exactly like George Bailey, the Baileys didn't chop up Clarence the angel, eat him and make furniture out of his bones...but I'm getting off the point. What follows is still pretty damn scary, although not as grisly as we have been led to believe - it is the degradation of humanity that is really frightening. The comically absurd behaviour of the cannibal family could be straight out of the Theatre of Cruelty. In particular, the scene where they encourage their decrepit Grandfather to bash one of the victims over the head whilst they hold her over a bucket, would have done Antonin Artaud proud.Of course all this was done on a minuscule budget and it is every bit as impressive in logistic terms as the contemporaneous work of Cassavetes, more so, because it was competing directly with other films in its genre made for ten times the amount. Of course like Romero before him, Hooper never really fitted in to Hollywood afterwards. He made one huge hit - Poltergeist - and then didn't really know what to do with himself. Since then, there's been the average Life Force and numerous misjudged failures. T.C.M. showed him in his natural milieu as a gorilla film maker. Forget The Tree of Wooden Clogs, rush out and see the tree with body parts tied to it, before 'they' take it away from us again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was recommended this movie by a friend because I told him I was not scared of any horror movies. I have seen all of the Friday the 13th's, Freddy movies, and even old B rated horror and nothing could have prepared me for this. I was scared out of my mind. My girlfriend who likes horror, started to cry because of how disturbing this movie was. The cannibalistic family is pre-empted by a crazy hitch-hiker who sets the movies tone as he goes berserk and slices his own flesh. Later, we are introduced to Leatherface as he violently swings open a steel meatlocker door, grabs a victim, kills him, and drags him into his hell kitchen. Just seeing the house in which Leatherface lives made me cringe (observing benches made of human bones). The movie taking place in the seventies makes it even scarier. The movie resolves in a gruesome torturous dinner with the cannibalistic family. A girl is forced to sit with them at the dinner table, eat human flesh, and slowly and painfully get tortured to death. From the movie's score, to the fact that it is partly a true story makes this movie most frightening of all time on my list!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A grisly and shocking film which gives a rare insight into the darker side of horror. Many slasher movies have followed since this but few can capture the terror that so successfully appears here. The killers are suitably repulsive and launch their assault both suddenly and savagely, allowing little time for the audience to prepare itself. As slasher films go this is far above average and where some of the genre tend towards comedy the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remains sickeningly brutal throughout.</fullReview>

Now the sequels are far inferior to this film, please remember that. The original has to be viewed with an open mind. That is what the film does actually, it opens your mind. It shows a different moral structure than we are accustomed to here. It shows what happens when the rules change. There is no fluff here. It comes right out at you and never lets up. It is not a very kind film, but instead it is a wake-up call to reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tobe Hooper's 1974 misunderstood masterpiece includes road trip, bickering couples, annoying slobs in wheelchairs, creepy hitchhikers, ramblings about astrology, cannibalism and the melodious sounds of a chainsaw in 80 minutes of mayhem. Phew! What it doesn't have is a bucketful of blood, despite some older reviews mentioning it. Instead it relies upon a feeling of hopelessness, aided by the stifling heat and the unfriendly surroundings, not to mention some really dark humor.Hooper never came close to unleashing the same brand of horror again though he has some good films on his resume like Poltergeist and The Funhouse.For that matter, no movie in the original series or even the remake came even remotely close to matching this one's power.Do yourself a favor and watch this classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a good example of a controversial and banned film that's actually really good. Despite the horrid title, it's not as violent as it's made out to be and there's not a lot of blood. Although it was banned until 1999 it looks fairly tame by today's standards, but what horror filmmakers should realize is that gore is not scary. It can actually be rather tedious. This low budget horror film about a group of 5 young adults on a trip to the house of the grandfather of 2 of them who encounter a family of cannibals, including a chainsaw wielding maniac thankfully defies expectations and avoids the red stuff mostly. Mixing subtle social commentary with terrifying, borderline harrowing horror, be warned: Bring the cushions (to hide behind). Tobe Hooper, sadly stuck on B movies presently, uses documentary style camera-work with excruciatingly long takes and an uncanny sense of realism mixed with surreal imagery to create a nightmarish story of terror that feels strangely real.The acting is decent. There are no standouts but none of the actors give bad performances. The script strips the genre right down and keeps things uncomplicated, making the film feel more realistic. Leatherface, the chainsaw wielding maniac, never says a word and isn't even the leader of the grotesque parody of a family that capture the main characters, but certainly leaves the biggest impression. In general, the film is shot brilliantly and thanks to the social commentary isn't just tasteless exploitation. However, the social commentary is a bit too subtle for many who haven't already read analyses of the film to get, so the film may just seem like unpleasant violence for no reason. The characters and plot are paper thin; minimalism works well in this case, but whenever the characters die there's little emotion associated with their exits. The lack of interesting protagonists with distinguishable personalities prevent this from being a truly great film, but it is something of a classic which is a truly scary classic. For once, the jump scares don't ruin the movie.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After all these years just viewed the classic and vintage 1974 original "Texas Chain Saw Massacre", and I must say that for it's day and time in 1974 the film sure packed punch and plenty of fright gore! Still I probably say this old classic was the best not just because of it's first born, but for the fact of it's blood and real terror realism as they just don't make a film like this anymore as this 1974 gem was done in it's own way actually this picture would change the way torture horror would be done. Set in rural Texas on a hot August weekend five youths cruise around on a getaway in the country only to wonder and fall upon an old house of a masked butcher(leather face)and his grave robbing skin flesh eating family! And this film was made to be very violent and graphic for the year of 1974 as director Tobe Hooper pushed the limits, this film is certainly a masterpiece a gem a classic that would shape it's genre it's one picture landmark that still brings terror and fright after forty years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very scary, if weird and slow at times. A nightmare!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally I got to watch the Texas Chainsaw Massacre last night. I have to say, I didn't like it as much as I thought I would, but this is still a great film. I was surprised at how much of the movie doesn't have horror, especially considering that this film is only 83 minutes long. I was waiting through much of the non-horror parts, wondering when everything was going to start. Thankfully, this film serves up some quality horror-great death scenes, constant feelings of dread and nightmarish chases. Some horror scenes did drag on a bit, but not much. The grainy quality of the picture and sound increases the fear levels, and this film is surprisingly lacking in gore. We, as the viewers, are left to imagine what is really happening.In conclusion, this movie isn't without flaws. The film can feel very weird at times-the dialogue, the way people talk and the strong 1970's culture. Also, it took a long time for the horror to get started. But this film does serve up some quality horror. It can be very scary. A nightmare! An all-out assault on the mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Five friends visiting their grandfather's house in the country are hunted and terrorized by a chain-saw wielding killer and his family of grave-robbing cannibals. En route to visit their grandfather's grave (which has apparently been ritualistically desecrated), five teenagers drive past a slaughterhouse, pick up (and quickly drop) a sinister hitch-hiker, eat some delicious home-cured meat at a roadside gas station, before ending up at the old family home... where they're plunged into a never-ending nightmare as they meet a family of cannibals who more than make up in power tools what they lack in social skills. Roger Ebert said: "Horror and exploitation films almost always turn a profit if they're brought in at the right price. So they provide a good starting place for ambitious would-be filmmakers who can't get more conventional projects off the ground. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre belongs in a select company (with Night of the Living Dead and Last House on the Left) of films that are really a lot better than the genre requires." The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is pure, uncompromised horror! A modern classic which still confronts, disturbs and terrifies audiences worldwide. It is very, very unsettling as well, from the beginning to the final dinner scene, to the unforgettable whirling dance by Leatherface at the end. It truly is the definition of fear, I highly recommend it to everyone who wants to be shocked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bleak masterpiece of horror cinema.The documentary-style approach is what pushes this flick over the top; it's a grim and glorious classic of modern horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a bona fide genre classic, a one-of-a-kind film that will be remembered in the annals of Horror until the end of time. Its reputation is partially built on the name and the imagery it convokes in a popular culture sense, but the film is so much more, a dark, moody, extraordinarily well made, and deeply frightening experience that relies far less on gore and far more on suggestion and atmosphere and purely evil characters to scare its audience. It's the pinnacle of the Horror genre and a film not to be missed.Chainsaw-wielding Leatherface remains one of the most disturbing characters in horror. Artfully documentary like and shot under conditions that produced genuinely traumatized performances, the original Massacre eschews cheap thrills and attacks the psyche.A profoundly sensitive look at social prejudices and the toll said prejudices take on the human social organism. It is not that the movie is particularly graphic, with very little blood actually being spilled on screen. Rather, it's a very disturbing film.based on the life and "career" of Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Texas Chainsaw Massacre certainly doesn't have the same atmosphere and thrilling moments as My Bloody Valentine (1981) or Sleepaway Camp (1983). Still, Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a great slasher movie, low-budget but still pulling off providing entertainment the whole way through. I won't spoil the plot, but it has elements of Terror at Red Wolf Inn, Redneck Zombies and the Hills Have Eyes. There is cannibalism involved, along with a creepy family that makes this one disturbing movie. The soundtrack was unmemorable, but the acting was decent enough. I don't think I agree with its current 7.5/10 rating, I think that's a little much, but TCM is still a good enough movie. Sadly its been remade and copied various times over the years, leaving it unoriginal and predictable. This has been the fate of countless slasher films, unfortunately. While TCM isn't one of my favorites, it's still worth checking out, and whatever you do make sure you view this one before watching any of the remakes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This slasher movie appears outdated for good reasons, because that olden film feel actually adds to the terrifying horror to this movie. Especially with the psychotic acting and raw cinematography and effects. Mixed in with the crazy noise effects really does bring out the psychologically horrifying atmosphere. And the atmosphere and the craziness is what makes this slasher movie stand out. There is a lot of tension when the victims are running or fighting for their lives. With elements that stick out with it's raw and demented imageries. This is a low-budget horror/slasher movie that leaves it's mark in this genre. What surprised me while watching this movie, is the lack of gore in it. And I thought this movie was gonna have LOTS of blood and gore. It does have blood, but wasn't as bloody and gory as I thought it was gonna be. And for a slasher movie to instill fear into the audiences without lots of blood and gore. And the fear is driven by the atmosphere, imageries, chaotic noises and relentlessness.7.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this when it was re-released at the cinema after having been banned for many years in the UK. It was shocking and intense, not because of the gore (it's pretty light on that) but because of the bizarre production design, the heavy atmosphere, the terror of the characters and the relentless disgustingness of the whole thing.The time round... pretty tedious stuff. Maybe the intensity has gone because the shock of the new has worn off, maybe it's because post-'Saw', post-'Hostel', it all seems a bit tame. Leatherface and his bone-and-skin approach to interior design are still creepy, but without the driving sense of horror the pace is a crawl and as much of the movie is basically a helpless woman screaming in terror, which is, you know, unpleasant, this is a movie I can do without.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is GREASY. It's like rubbing your face in an unwashed frying pan. People feel clever talking about how little explicit violence is actually shown, but it's true; this is a case of excellent pacing, composition, sound work, and general atmosphere all coming together into something completely elemental and engaging the imagination, which is why so many people have the impression it was some sort of gorefest even after seeing it. The raw, unglamourized grit of it all never lets up, but there are some paradoxical glimpses of macabre Gothic beauty--images like those corpse statues and bony decorations have been burned into my brain, and obviously, that final shot is the stuff of legends. But ultimately this is the movie that revealed the seedy underbelly of the summer of love, and nothing has matched it in corner-licking DANKNESS AND GRIME since.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before i watched this film i was a bit hesitant because i don't like really gory films. I assumed it was really gory by the title of it, "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre". But when i watched i soon found out that it wasn't gory at all. Just really frightening and extremely intense. I've seen some films that are quite scary, but in my opinion, they can't beat this one. What i find so scary about this film is its ending where the woman at the end is captured by leather face and his family and they frighten her and mentally torture her. I also find the bit where Leatherface's brother is mocking the woman's cries for help and laughing in her face. This film is definitely going to be on my top ten horror movie list. And the most frightening shot in the movie is probably the final shot of Leather face dancing with the chainsaw in his hand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly deserves its cult horror classic reputation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A vanload of kids driving across the country run afoul of a crazed degenerate family of vicious redneck killers in remote rural Texas. That's it for the (admittedly slight) set-up, but the plot is basically inconsequential as this one's really all about creating and sustaining a supremely dark, grim, and unsparingly harsh mood that gets under your skin and makes you squirm like a hapless fish caught on a hook. Director Tobe Hooper's masterful talent for crafting a raw, rattling and uncompromisingly fierce intensity that slowly, yet surely builds to a nerve-wracking fever pitch in the harrowing last third (the infamous diner table sequence is particularly horrifying) has never been matched or surpassed in either any of the subsequent sequels or in the needless and atrocious overly graphic remake. Hooper's strong evocation of the bleak, dusty and desolate Texas backwoods projects a profound sense of dread and unease which never lets up for a minute. Moreover, Hooper's wise decision to keep the violence largely off-screen enhances rather than detracts from the film's alarming power to scare and disturb; this welcome and refreshing concession to the viewer's imagination ensures that the movie never deteriorates into a mindless and revolting bloodbath while still allowing the jolting outbursts of sudden brutal violence to retain their ability to startle the audience. The admirable refusal to provide some kind of explanation for why the horrific goings-on occur qualifies as another major asset; instead Hooper and co-writer Kim Henkel merely present a stark and unwavering depiction of random gratuitous violence and unbridled savagery as if such horrible things happen all the time. This movie is further enhanced by a wickedly funny sense of black-as-coal gallows humor, with the loony hick clan -- the weary, bitter old man (marvelously played by Jim Siedow), unhinged hitchhiker (a deliciously batty portrayal by Edwin Neal), and the freakish, squealing, gibbering Leatherface (an astonishingly bestial and bloodcurdling Gunnar Hansen) -- serving as a strikingly grotesque caricature of your typical American family. Marilyn Burns makes for a fetching and pitiable luckless damsel-in-distress as Sally while Paul A. Partain contributes a memorably obnoxious performance as the extremely whiny, hateful and unsympathetic cripple Franklin. Kudos are also in order for the wondrous wealth of inspired macabre touches: a chicken in a birdcage, the armchair made out of human bones, and the aged grandfather (John Dugan in hideously wizened make-up) who drinks human blood. The spare, droning and dissonant experimental score by Hooper and Wayne Bell adds substantially to the picture's considerable unsettling impact. Daniel Pearl's grainy, but polished cinematography offers several smooth and sinuous tracking shots that are positively breathtaking to behold. Essential viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A grindhouse classic for good reason. A lot of the tropes for the road trip slashers and backwoods slashers started here. A brilliant opening with the corpses set up like a piece of morbid art in a cemetery.Then one is introduced to lead characters involved in the discovery one of the most macabre crimes in the annals of American history. But whom none have a lick of sense from the git go. Sally Hardesty, her invalid brother Franklin, her boyfriend Kirk, and their friends Pam and Jerry.Who would pick up a hitchhiker that resembled greasy nappy haired white trash unless one thought they might score some good weed or something? But this dude does not look like good company. Bad choice number 1.When Franklin meets the hitchhiker's deadly straightedge steel maybe a waiting room visit to a local clinic or hospital is in order to get properly stitched up and get a tetanus shot. And taken the opportunity to put a police report on the culprit. And also refill the gas tank d'oh. Bad choice number 2.In rural areas especially during a national gas crisis of the 70s, wouldn't it be a great idea to refill the tank when the best opportunity arises? Kirk's lament he wished that they had "stopped back there for gas" is quite correct. Bad choice number 3.When Franklin asks about his granddaddies place, the cook gives sound advice for Franklin, Jerry, and Kirk to follow especially in gun happy rural Texas. Messing around in old houses is dangerous and liable to get people hurt. And yes, some folks don't like fooling around on their private property and they certainly don't mind showing you. Bad choice number 4.Yes, a lot could have been avoided had these kids used their heads.But despite a whole load of dumb the film has it's brilliant touches like the opening and a creepy villain that has made his home a hellish replica of Dante's Inferno has an affinity for sledgehammers and chainsaws and wants to eat you and wear your face.If anything Karma rules in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre just like Pam's horoscope readings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even 'Psycho' isn't this disturbing. Said film is considered to be the king of slasher films and certainly paved the way for many that have come since. It is, however, tame by today's standards, but that doesn't make it any less a masterwork. It was even tame by the standards of the 1970s, especially when compared with this nasty little gem. Like Hitchcock's film, 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' is loosely based on real life killer Ed Gein, but unlike that film this one goes further and audiences were taken aback. Now, over 30 years after it's release time has been very kind to it and the film still terrifies like no other.Pros: Good job done by a totally unknown cast. Gorgeous photography. Plenty great scares and gruesome imagery. Pace is slow, but steady. Director Hooper and writer Henkel do a bang-up job of keeping viewers in suspense and on edge. Score is subtle and creepy. Excellent production design. The low budget look and feel of the film really help in making it seem real. The family is one of the most memorable bunch of crazies on screen and you'll be afraid.Cons: Has lost a little of it's power over the years. We get to know Sally and Franklin pretty well, but it would have been nice to get to know the others better than we do.Final thoughts: So many have tried and failed at trying to capture the raw terror of this classic. Even the 2003 remake, which is quite good on it's own, can't touch this. And let it be a warning to all of you who go on a road-trip and think about stopping to explore some old house. You never know what horrors you might find.My rating: 4.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who would have thought that this low, low budget film would have served as inspiration for so many other horror films for years to come. Not only have there been sequels, but also a couple remakes. A new film about the childhood of Leatherface will be out soon, as well. That such a small film could become such a pop culture phenomenon is truly amazing.The film itself, directed by Tobe Hooper was filmed over just a few days one hot summer in Texas. Hooper allegedly got the idea by imagining himself slicing his way through a crowded store using a chainsaw. Other accounts claim the film was inspired by the real life story of serial killer Ed Gein who, like Leatherface, wore around the skin from dead bodies. Either way you slice it, this film has all you need to make an effective horror film. It's brutal, cheap, atmospheric, has a great villain, and most of all, it's scary. The story deals with five young adults becoming stranded near a rural farmhouse where a cannibalistic family dwells, waiting for just these kinds of victims to happen by. There are about three generations of the family represented by some truly sick individuals. The most memorable being "Leatherface". He's a great big guy running around the property with a chainsaw and wearing a mask of human skin. The concept alone is shocking. The execution is outstanding.Despite the title, the film doesn't rely on too much gore. Only one victim is actually killed with the weapon of record. A couple of victims are bashed over the head like cattle from the slaughterhouse where the family once worked. Another young woman is hung on a meat hook. Apparently, the first young man whom we see Leatherface dispose of had never seen actor Gunnar Hansen in costume yet. His expression of shock when first confronted is genuine. As usual, the last good person standing is a female. She was played by the beautiful Marilyn Burns, and she gives as terrified a performance as any other woman in a similar film. Scene after scene pushes the characters and the audience to the limit. Just how much horror can you endure? How many disgusting characters will we be introduced to? One interesting footnote was that director Tobe Hooper intended this film to get a PG rating. He cut it numerous times, but no luck. What was he thinking? If released today, it would probably just be able to grab a PG-13. There are some who insist on looking for deeper meanings in this simplistic story. Some would claim that our victims' plight resembles that of many Americans in the 1970s during the gas crisis. Stuck, and at the mercy of those around us. The wheelchair-bound character Franklin would seem the perfect metaphor for being completely at the mercy of those who might not have any left to spare. Even if you don't look any deeper than the surface, you'll find a really terrific horror film here.8 of 10 stars. The Hound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Title: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) Director: Tobe Hooper Cast: Gunner Hansen, Marylin Burns, Ed Neil, Jim Siedow Tagline: Who will survive and what will be left of them? Review: Checking this film out after having seen all of Tobe Hoopers films I can honestly say that this one is his crowning achievement. It has the raw, unrelenting, dirty feel of horror thats missing from todays modern horror films.Five friends go on a summer drive to visit their grandfathers grave which has apparently been dug up by some local mad man. While they are there they decide to visit his abandoned home which is right smack in the middle of Nowhere Texas. Too bad for them they run into a family of Cannibals.Though Hooper would revisit the themes addressed in Texas Chainsaw Massacre a few times yet again in films like Eaten Alive, The Funhouse and Texas Chainsaw Massacre part II this was the first film in which he ventured into the crazy family of maniacs realm. He would never again achieve the level of realism and rawness seen on this, his first film. It certainly is one of his most focused efforts.I love how the film starts out so normal, so quietly yet ever so slowly goes down into a seemingly never ending nightmare. The intensity of the last half of the film is amazing and you really do feel sometimes like you'd like for Marylin Burns to get away, you cant wait for her to finally break away from this family of raving lunatics. Hooper stretches the scenes in which Sally is tormented making all the more torturous for the viewer. (But if your a horror fan you'll love it!) There's many images that are classic to me, like the first instance when we see Leatherface and that moment when he closes the metal door to his slaughter room. (Shudders!) Or those scenes with Leatherface swinging his chainsaw in the air. Its still horrifying to this day and what I liked most about it was that it achieves this without showing much blood or gore, its all suggested yet it still manages to scare and horrify you.While watching this I couldn't help but think that the whole Chainsaw series is just a series of remakes. Part II was basically Hoopers big budget cartoony version of the first, Part IV is just a rehash of the first one as well. It appears to me that aside from the original the only sequel of this series to travel unchartered territory is part III. Surprisingly though, the remake managed to present us with some new elements which practically make it a whole new film, but its still a remake.Hoopers direction heres is top notch, he makes some shots and some instances really stand out. Like those opening sequences with the shots of the rotting corpses on the grave yard, or the scenes with the camera taking snapshots of the corpses, great stuff! I also like Sallys truly insane moments, specially those were Hooper just does these really great close ups on her eyes.Another standout part of the film was the art direction done by Robert A. Burns. The look and feel of the families house is one of the things about the film that really makes it all the more strange and horrifying. The furniture with the human skeletons, the animal bones hanging around the house just weird freaky things that make the feeling of the film all the more creepier.This flick is Hoopers best film and shouldn't be missed by any self respecting horror fan. It shows us where all of todays new generation of slashers are getting their inspiration. Films like Wrong Turn, House of a Thousand Corpses and Cabin Fever are obvious homages to this one. But the Texas Chainsaw Massacre was the first to show us what a real slasher should be like and thanx in no small part to Tobe Hooper it also showed us what a real horror film should feel like.Rating: 5 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The terror yardstick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I once heard certain horror films referred to as terror films. The writer was distinguishing films like LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, THE HILLS HAVE EYES and THE HOUSE BY THE LAKE from films like BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN and THE SIXTH SENSE. I can understand why the distinction was being made.THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, Hooper's original, is the terror yardstick against which all terror films should be measured because it does everything right.As it is not my style to synopsize films (synopses bore me), I'm going to keep it short as usual. TEXAS has balls. TEXAS has style. TEXAS has more on its mind than is up on the screen.The film's violence is powerful and relatively bloodless, the performances are realistic and the photography draws us slowly into the charnel house of the soul with its insistent, low angle perspective and adherence to hard lighting. The Family is a terrific creation, a bunch of unpredictable misfits who'd slice you up the belly for looking sideways at them.The relentlessness of the narrative gives the film enormous power and singularity of vision.It's not so much a chainsaw massacre as a massacre of the senses.Whatever else Hooper has done, it will probably not eclipse the rawness of this open cinematic wound. You've been warned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original, although lacks in several areas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tobe Hooper's TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE is realistic horror, which is the scariest kind. I hate all the far fetched flicks like JEEPERS CREEPERS, JOY RIDE, and even the classic NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. Although, why this is considered the best horror film of all time is beyond me. It lacks in character development(which is done so well in the new remake by Marcus Nispel and Michael Bay), and sound and cinematography is poor. Even though the film is low budget, Hooper didn't impress me with anything except originality. The dialogue was terrible. This was the first true horror film of its time and needs to be commended for that, but overall, I didnt like it much. Doesn't compare to the 2003 remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fact that Tobe Hooper hasn't made a decent movie in over ten years is mind-boggling when one considers that he is the central force behind this masterpiece of terror. One of (if not the) first slasher movies is still the best, and one of the few movies of any genre that can be called "perfect". A remake is totally unwarranted. Hooper and company successfully did exactly what they set out to do--make a great horror movie. Intense, scary, suspenseful, funny, surreal, bizarre. The fact that barely a pint of blood is spilt onscreen is astonishing. A triumph in the art of suggestion, a movie that is so outrageous and demented you never notice who subtly it reels you in. Sheer brilliance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the hell happened there?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone's heard of this notorious groundbreaking horror film, but it's reputation as one of the goriest films of it's genre is thoroughly undeserved. What is true however, is that TTCM is a truly unsettling experience but this is achieved through a pervading feeling of menace, not the explicit violence more frequently used by it's peers. There are no overwrought set-piece slayings, no decapitations or disembowelling. The killings are, in the main, relatively quick and workmanlike. The scenes that produce the most squirming are those involving the meat hook and aside from that the two instances of small knife cuts. Even the meat hook event, which is deeply unnerving, shows no actual gore.The plot is really quite insignificant, as are the performances of the ubiquitous imperilled teens. The real stars of this movie are the cunning use of sound and the sheer insanity portrayed by the family of butchers. The absence of any score creates a heightened sense of awareness and the discordant use of sound effects are similarly designed to unsettle. The relentless buzz of the chainsaw and the ceaseless sound of the generator are used to similarly good effect. The film is heavy in mood but light in actual content. The speech in the establishing scenes is occasionally mumbled and unclear, while there is very little character development before the killings begin, removing any empathy. However, this film is extremely effective in what it sets out to achieve and never has ideas above it's station, and so avoids over-reaching itself. It's not the most thoughtful or complex piece of work, but that's probably not what anyone renting a film about a chainsaw massacre is looking for is it?The villains of the piece are made all the more scary by the sheer lack of motive in their actions. Most celluloid serial killers are out for vengeance or have some similar back story to their crime spree, but these guys just seem to be butchering people for their own enjoyment. The father switches between sadism and misplaced concern with alarming alacrity, while Leatherface and his brother derive great pleasure in the torture of the heroine. This empty feeling is compounded by an ending brave enough not to provide any kind of closure; instead it leaves the viewer pondering exactly what the hell happened there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a film! - truly shocking! - HAS TO BE SEEN!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of movies and the IMDB, I watch many movies but seldom review any of them, I don't know why, I guess for me it's a real effort and I have to be truly moved to even consider sharing my feelings with the rest of the IMDB, however this movie is different. Not since Day of the Dead earlier this year (see my review) had I been looking forward to a movie so much and what I saw hit me like a sledgehammer and left me numb and buzzing, open jawed, like few movies I have seen in the past ever have (and I've seen a lot of movies, believe me). I was not dissapointed in any way. The TCM is far more than a cheap exploitation picture it goes way beyond that through the intensly disturbing / terrifying atmosphere the director masterfully creates, cleverly using editing and sound, between violent shocks, the violence - though shocking when it happens is not actually that gory or graphic, it's all down to atmosFEAR (get it...- sorry).MAY BE SPOILERS AHEAD As we witness the unfortunate Texan teens meeting violent ends at the hands of the masked, demented, chainsaw wielding Leatherface. I bet they wished they hadn't gone to that house now. The last quarter of the movie is especially stunning as we witness the chase, the dinner scene, the stunning finale, and we are introduced to the rest of the crazed family who we had come across earlier in the movie, but didn't know at the time, this for me is where the cleverness lies.A standout scene for me would be where the old man has just bought Sally back to the house in his truck and we see the previously terrifying Leatherface cowering in front of the old man (presumably their father) like a frightened child, as the old man shouts at him about wrecking the door and the other teens. This for me is amongst great insights into the family, without which, the movie probably would be just cheap slasher trash - which it most certainly is not.This movie also serves as a serious warning to everyone, not to go snooping where you don't belong in rural Texas or anywhere else in the world.A film of this calibre, with this much feeling and this sort of atmosphere just could not be made today - thank god for the 70's.Amazing</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I realize that I have already written a review of this film but I just watched it again for the first time in a few years and I have to say more about it. TCM is a film that is a prime example of why horror films of the 90's can never match the horror of the 70's and 80's. This film was a dark disturbing look at a family gone mad. They have no reason, no remorse and no pity for doing the things that they do. The only thing I can even think of is that they have all worked at a slaughter house and the daily grind of taking an animal's life has desensitized them to the value of life, whether it be human or animal. I found it quite interesting that the film goes into great detail on how a cow is killed. Because what that does (besides gross us out) is it shows how sadistic a process it is to get our meat from the animal that it came from to the cellophane wrappers in the grocery store. And then when these butchers do the same thing to the humans in the story, it becomes more real, more disturbing and more eye opening. It makes the characters helpless. And it easy to live vicariously through the characters in this film, especially the main (Debbie) character. You can see how mad she has become by going through what she has. She has been brutalized in almost every way you can imagine. Physically, she is a mess, but psychologically she would never be the same after her experience. Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a rare film that shows that you don't need special effects or even a large budget to make a scary film. All you need is some ingenuity, a vision and a horrific story. TCM has all three.Last House On The Left was disturbing because it was mean and graphic, TCM is disturbing because I have never felt that a film was more of a documentary than a Hollywood film. And that is perhaps why Hollywood can not produce really good horror films, because they all try to put their own take on things and then edit the hell out of the film. Some of the best horror films have been independents ( Halloween, Evil Dead and TCM ). I don't for one second believe that Debbie is an actor. To me she really went through this nightmare. She really was tortured by a sick family of cannibals. Her performance was one of sheer terror. When she screams, you believe that it is real. It felt and looked like Tobe Hooper just put a camera at this house and film all that went on there. And there really has to be a Leatherface. He felt that real. Also, the fact that there was absolutely no lighting can be attributed to two things. 1) I know they had no budget. But secondly, the darkness adds to the fear, the paranoia and the mass confusion that this movie makes us experience. There are times when you don't know what's going on. All you hear is that disgusting buzz saw. And you know it is close, but just not how close. I really believe that the lighting, or lack there of, is really a good element that this film possesses. There are people that have said that this film doesn't stand up well over time, that it has lost some of its scares. Well I challenge anyone to watch this film with the lights off, and alone. If you don't get frightened by all that this movie stands for, then I don't think there is a movie out there that can frighten you. Not Halloween, not Jaws and not Aliens. Because as great as those films are, they are not any more frightening than this film is. And if you are honest with yourself, no matter how much of a fan of modern horror you are, you have to admit that a horror film from 1974 beats the living hell out of anything that has been pawned off in the 90's. Urban Legend, Lake Placid, The Haunting, H2O, The Final Friday, Carrie 2, they all pale in comparison to what Texas Chainsaw Massacre will do to you. This film is the personification of fear. Films will never be made like this again. They are too intelligent and frightful. Tobe Hooper is a horror genius. This is his best and most honest work. Fear... is to know The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly terrifying, roaring classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" really does not need any explanation given to it. It's classic horror and if you are a horror fan, you aren't really a proper one if you haven't seen this one yet. To be fair, it took me a fair long while to get my hands on it, I was waiting for it to come on the telly, but I got fed up of waiting and decided to just buy it to coincide with my "Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2" (which is completely different, but good in its own way.) The title may be eye-catching, but it has some incredible content to warrant that title."The Texas Chain saw Massacre" is just full of so many classic moments, from the hitch hiker scene to Kirk's death, from the dinner scene to leatherface's insane chainsaw ballet, it's incredibly iconic. It's also one of the very few films that has managed to scare me. Some people might laugh at it in places, but to me (and many others it seems) it's just completely terrifying. "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" has this unique raw feeling, which separates it from other films, because it doesn't feel like a film, it feels real and almost documentary-like. It's surreal insanity also makes for unsettling viewing because it feels like a nightmare. There's a choking atmosphere of dread throughout, which probably shines through because the cast actually went crazy in that unbearable baking heat.The lighting and cinematography are both impressive too. The final scene makes excellent use of the piercing morning sun, which gives this horrible edge to the images (a good kind of horrible) and the dinner scene is terrifyingly intense with the sharp sounds and close-ups of Marilyn's eyes. The chainsaw chase sequence is probably one of my favourite scenes in horror movie history. It completely renders that horrific feeling of being chased by someone with a chainsaw. The lack of music in that scene also adds to its stark realism. This film is way ahead of its time.Gunnar Hansen and the rest of the cannibal clan are also uncomfortable actors to watch. Gunnar's movements are brutal and scary, as he sort of stomps around and moves in a very animalistic way unlike Michael Myers or Freddy Kruger who are both slight fellows. Leatherface is very scary villain. Grandad is also pretty disturbing with the unnatural make-up and abnormal behaviour. "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" is also responsible for one of the most annoying characters in film history. Franklin. The wheelchair man. His high-pitched texan voice and irritating behaviour are both funny and annoying! But I think that he contributes to the film in a good way.Sound is used effectively as well, with the ambient noises of the abattoir playing in the background, and the piercing stings to highlight the imagery being used. Everything from the sound of the chainsaw to Marilyn's excellent vocal screaming all works perfectly to construct some realistic and scary footage! The ending is also beautifully done, and leaves you thinking, "what the hell have I just witnessed?" Some might say "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" is slow to build-up but I disagree. There's an atmospheric scene with the hitchhiker and a brilliant build-up to the obscure events that follow. It's a nightmarish and terrifying film that will always stay with you. It also seems to get better with every viewing, and acts as more of an experience than your average horror film. It's genuinely scary and quite simply a classic. If you haven't seen it yet, just go onto "Amazon" and click "Buy". It's worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years before I ever watched it, I heard the Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a gory, brutal horror film. While it isn't nearly as gory as movies made in the eighties and even movies made in recent years, it is a very grisly brutal film. It's about a young girl Sally, her wheelchair bound brother and their three friends who are on a road trip in Texas. An average weekend on the road quickly turns into a nightmare when a few of the friends decide to entire the infamous Texas Chainsaw house only to be savagely attacked and murdered by Leatherface. Eventually Sally is the only one left and she is forced to battle Leatherface and his crazed cannibalistic family.TCM is a very disturbing movie to watch first time around. It has a feel of Last House on the Left, but much more sophisticated than it. Some of the scenes which include one of the teenagers being flung onto a metal hook, and another being bludgeoned by Leatherface are grisly. They also help to make this the most talked about and scary horror films of all time. The sound of that chainsaw and seeing Leatherface running behind Sally in the woods is one of the most frightening images. I liked the chase scenes in this movie, they were really well done. I also loved the "twist" in the movie when the group buy some "BBQ" food from the local gas station. I won't tell you what exactly they were eating, I'm sure you can figure it out.The acting was pretty good for this kind of movie. Marilyn Burns gave a very believable performance as Sally during some of the torture and "dinner table" scenes. It is a must see movie in my opinion. Don't be fooled by any said level of gore. It isn't a movie for the squeamish, but that is not because any high level of blood and guts. TCM doesn't show much blood at all, it's the level of brutality from Leatherface and his clan that makes it grisly to watch. They are truly psychotic.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chief among "Chain Saw Massacre's" many virtues is a marvelously developed sense of mood. It is relentlessly creepy, even when it focuses on the mundane. Every design element vibrates with peril - the awful music on the radio in that Ford van; the voyeuristic camera skulking outside the farmhouse, abetted by the low menace of the generator; the sustained hysteria of the worst dinner party in cinema, are among the most well-executed achievements in the genre.The actual murder and torture are very limited - Tobe Hooper understood that the threat's the thing. He uses editing the way Eli Roth uses fake blood. Maybe Hooper was just limited by his resources, because he certainly went all the way to Spielberg heaven later on in his career. But for my money the expression on Jim Siebold's face, while he pokes the gunny-sacked Marilyn Burns with a stick, is scarier than any number of severed limbs or punctured eyeballs. And Gunnar Hansen's alarmed squeals are the more horrible for their quality of fear and confusion. This is a complex and logical universe that serves a useful purpose: it provides catharsis without indulgence.The difference between this and today's trend in horror is simple. Rob Zombie gets an erection from the naked dead girls in "Devil's Rejects," and he wants me to like it too. But I don't want to like it. In "Chain Saw," I am not titillated by the violence. I am traumatized, galvanized, shocked awake. The Platinum Dunes/Next Entertainment remake cycle simply repulses, substituting bludgeon for nuance. Tell a story, make a movie, frighten me - three skills Marcus Nispel has yet to master or even apprentice, even with all of Michael Bay's money.</fullReview>

The scariest part of this movie for me is that it is shot in documentary style like it seems so real. I hear it's based on a true story which sucks but the real guy didn't even live in Texas and he didn't use a chainsaw or so my uncle says but who cares. I hate to admit it but we had to throw in a Disney flick to relax and I don't think we're the only ones who've had to do that. I took away a point for being so sick but it gets a 9 for pure terror, makes these modern fright films look PG...Guess the moral of the movie is don't pick up hitchhikers and stay on the interstate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Modern Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 70's was a decade full of cinematic classics across all genres. This is especially true in the horror genre which enjoyed huge success during this decade, which is where the modern horror film was born.No film is more important to the modern horror film industry then the 1974 pseudo-gore classic - "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre." The first shot is of a sizzling, rotting corpse sitting under the hot Texas sun. You'd think with a start like that you'd know what to expect from this film. And there in lies it's brilliance. You know it's a horror film, you know what it's about, yet as the film progresses you are still shocked and terrified by the raw and honest manner in which the story is carried out.The film starts with a quiet tone and atmosphere which almost immediately gives off a foreboding silence that gives the impression of a calm before the storm. You know something bad is going to happen, you can tell...but the film is so unique, and so strikingly different from other horror films you can't predict how or what exactly is going to happen.The story is of 5 young hippies on a road trip in Texas, they run out of gas and go to a secluded house to try and find help and gas. What they find is TERROR! and lots of it.It's done in such a way that you never know what's going to happen next. There is no pounding music to build the suspense and let the viewer know to expect something, there is no coherent reason behind the gruesome acts of carnage we see, and as a result they come out of no where and completely blind side you.The scene that best exemplifies this is the scene where we first get a glimpse of leatherface. When he pops out with that mallet and smacks Kurt right in the head it leaves the viewer shocked and confused. We had no way of expecting that, and that feelings stays during the entire film.It's raw in every sense of the word, it's brilliance lies in it's anti cinematic feel...giving it a grainy plausible atmosphere that doesn't accept the idea of "it's only a movie". It's to real, it feels like what you're seeing is not just a movie but simply peering into the world of an absolute maniac who kills for no apparent reason other then not knowing any better.This brings me to the star of the film, and my favorite horror villain of all time - Leatherface. His animalistic yet childlike behavior makes him so much creepier and interesting then other slashers. He wears a mask of human flesh, he eats his victims, he kills without remorse...yet he feels innocent, like a child who doesn't know he shouldn't pull the cat's tail. He's scolded by his older brother and whimpers and cowards, he IS a child, mentally at least, and that's what makes him so disturbing. The idea that he doesn't know what he's doing is wrong. He's doing all he's even known, what HE thinks he needs to do to survive. He's vicious, yet innocent. This is insanity at it's best. Never once do you feel bored or let down by the film. You are never able to tell what is going to happen next. With each passing scene you think you've seen the worst the film has to offer. And yet the next scene you find yourself more shocked and confused then you were the scene prior. This is truly a testament to Tobe Hooper's brilliance that seems to have been lost immediately after making this film.In my opinion this is the pinnacle of horror films. It's the one that got me into the genre in hopes of finding another film that left me feeling as exhausted and drained as this did. While I never did find a film that affected me in a comparable way, I still can watch this film, after over a hundred times, and still get those chills I got the first time I saw it.If you're aching for some Halloween viewing, then do yourself a favor and go rediscover this gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellence in horror movie making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tobe Hooper is a genius. There is no better way to begin. This macabre masterpiece, loosely based on real events, remains to this day one of the single greatest movie accomplishments showing that blood and gore isn't the formula to a genuinely scary film.It's hard to put a finger on one particular strong point of the movie. It excels in so many areas. From it's direction to it's sound to it's atmosphere, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre leaves a chilling, disturbing mark on the viewer. Some see the excruciating camera angles and spine tingling ambiance as the real scare while others are disturbed by the fact that this is based on real events.The movie let's your mind do the scaring while the visuals set you up. And the absence of any real gore shows the amazing ability of Hooper to relay his desires to the audience by sheer horror movie talent.There is a reason that this is called a classic. One of the few "10"s out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The One That Almost Started-it-All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You don't truly love horror if there isn't-a-glimmer of affection for this film in your heart-of-hearts. If George Romero hadn't made "Night of the Living Dead", this would be the baby that kicked-it-all-off, the start of "modern-horror" in film and culture. The 1960s horror-film consisted-mainly of "Gothic-tale" films like Roger Corman's "Fall of the House of Usher", where a family declines, and the manor burns at-the-end. It got predictable, and it got boring by the tail-end (sound-familiar?). What the horror-world needed was something new, and Romero inspired-the-likes of David Cronenberg, Tobe Hooper, Wes Craven and many-many others to try-their-hands at the genre. It became a great-way to enter the industry, and still is in some-quarters.Indeed, by-the-late-1960s, Gothic-horror simply couldn't-compete with the daily-nightmares of racial-violence, rioting, the war in Vietnam, Police-brutality, the standoff at Wounded Knee by AIM, domestic-surveillance, the kidnapping-of Patty Hearst by the SLA, Charles Manson, Altamont, the Wethermen bombings, Kent State, Chile in 1973, the illegal-bombing of North Vietnam, Cambodia, or even the nightmare of Watergate. Out of this bloody-fray came a film that reflected all this extreme-violence, and that film was "Texas Chainsaw Massacre". The 1970s is a lost-time in movie-making when a small-film could rocket out-of-nowhere and floor-everyone, and floor-it-did. Horror will never-be-the-same again, thank-God. Wes Craven's classic, "Last House on the Left" (1972) had also-emerged, and the films complemented-each other in a one-two punch that re-energized American horror film-making--and created more-space for indie-productions on micro-budgets. In a visionary-stroke, director Peter Bogdanovich related how impotent the "old-horror" had really-become in his excellent "Targets" (1968), essaying the decline of an aging horror-star (played-by the dying Boris Karloff) and young-man who decides to become an urban-sniper. The climax has the sniper shooting-at drive-in moviegoers while a cheesy "Gothic-horror" plays on-the-screen, a great-contrast. No, if horror was to survive as a genre, it had to emulate and go-beyond what people were seeing-everyday on their television-sets (Americans saw more graphic-violence from Vietnam and urban-rioting than we do today, as media-ownership was less-concentrated then). The irony is that there is very-little blood in Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The film had more of a reputation, than a reality to it, a reputation that even overshadowed the actual-film itself. But it's still plenty-scary, as one could imagine these things happening--because they do. Add-to-that the claim (false) that it was a "true story" in the movie's prologue-voice-over (by John Laroquette of "Night Court" fame, an early-gig), and many-people even saw the film as being a "snuff". There are no snuff-films, incidentally, only torture-videos created by Latin American death-squads (funded-by us), and other repressive-regimes, and are political-byproducts. But if Tobe Hooper is saying-anything with Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it is that murder and violence "begin-in-the-home", and what a home it is! Ostensibly-based on details of Ed Gein's years before his discovery-and-capture, Hooper created a creepy-scenario that was believable after Manson. It is simply a unique-film, from a unique-moment in American history, yet it is so basic and primal. I haven't seen the remake, so I cannot say if the updating is relevant to our times, but I have heard that Tobe has said good-things about-it. What made this film so great was how small it was, and how the limitations only added-to the hysteria of the film. The final-sequences were shot in a farmhouse in 100-degree+ temperatures, the hysteria is REAL. Daniel Pearl's photography is great, but since they only had the budget for 16mm, it resembles a documentary. I believe this is over-half of the power of the film-itself, as it appears someone went-along and just filmed "what-happened", but there's some of the genius of Hooper's directorial-style--"style" is invisible, it seems very plausible and real. Granted, it is difficult to make original-statements in the genre today, but the creators of the future-additions should ask-themselves this: "Where is the line, and how do I get-away-with crossing-it?" The new-innovators won't be doing remakes, and they'll innovate on-accident, you can-bank-on-it.</fullReview>

With the masked murderer concept to the cannibalistic family members. Tobe Hooper created the pinnacle of American horror (which is the best horror genre). This is the film that everyone pays respect to. This film is not only the best horror film it is one of the best films ever made. With superb acting from Marilyn Burns, that blows away anything Jamie Lee Curtis could do, and the power of the Leatherface character played by Gunnar Hanson accompanied with the wonderful cinematography and the superb directing of Hooper this truly is an American Classic. This film brings real fear and slight hint of dark humor bring to life a movie that comments on the break down of the American family. This picture is a true piece of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first watched this I expected just alot of gore. Because I had seen the 4th Chainsaw Massacre before this I wasn't expecting much. But from the opening scene I got this overwhelming sense of dread. And you find yourself telling the characters not to do that, its stupid! and other things. My heart pounded the whole way thru. This is much scarier than The Exorcist or Halloween. This movie was made to look cheap and grainy, and that adds to the effect of scariness. This movie is not for the weak of heart and after you see this movie you will never forget some of the images that you will see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a shocking film and although the special effects may be considered primitive, the subject matter will always remain disturbing and perverse. This film has a reputation, even amongst those who've never seen it. The title itself is emotive and instills an uneasy feeling in those who hear it. Perhaps because it's set in Texas? : ) After watching it, I realised that it's not a particuarly enjoyable film. It's macarbe nature seems completely gratuitous and uncomfortable. The screenplay is painfully simple and the characters are arguably the stupidest in cinema history. (For example, there is a big old house with skeletons hanging off the walls and each kid feels the necessity to step inside and have a look around, one after the other. Franklin, the fat kid in the wheelchair, is so annoying, you literally count down the minutes until he's drawn and quartered.) The last twenty minutes of the movie consists of a girl running from a man with a chainsaw. I seriously question the mental health of anyone who would set out to write and create something so sadistic.Tobe Hooper is a talented director and it is the direction in this film, which is its saving grace. There are some electrifying shots of the victims eyes in an extreme close up, which captures terror and at the same time brings a frightening reality to movie. Hooper's greatest achievement is arguably 1982's 'Poltergeist', which is one of the few enjoyable films which Steven Speilberg has had his grubby paws on. After this film, Hooper mainly went on to direct TV series, Tele-movies and B-grade horror movies, the best of which, being 'Dark Skies' in 1996, starring the gorgeous Megan Ward.In conclusion, this is not a film that is over-rated nor is it under-rated. It probably won't be as graphic as you're expecting but, after 'The Exorcist' it's one of the most shocking films of all time. It serves a purpose in cinema history as being one of the earliest slasher films, involving a group of teenagers running from a psychopath in a remote area. The characters are all unbearingly dim-witted and when they each meet their grisly end, you find it hard to feel sympathy. It's well directed and if you're a budding director perhaps it's worth seeing. It's also worth seeing if you want something scary and trashy to watch at a slumber party, or if you simply want to be able to boast about seeing it. It's not a film that every movie buff will stomach, however it sits rightfully on its shelf in cinema history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is quite frankly a horror masterpiece. Along with "Psycho", "The silence of the lambs" and "Henry: portrait of a serial killer" it's strength lies in that it's impact is due to it's psychological affect. Tobe Hooper masterfully steers away from typical slasher tactics so prevalent in the 1970's and instead leads the viewer into a world of insanity, which is far more threatening and unsettling. We all know it borrows heavily from the true story of Wisconsin killer cannibal Ed Gein, but Hooper takes it one step further. Instead of a solitary loner we get an entire family of lunatics. The beauty of this film though is Hooper avoids over the top scenarios and basically washes his hands of any special effects, and instead cleverly plays on subtle glimpses into the disturbing rituals and lifestyle of Leatherface and his clan. The scene where the camera pans around the front parlour, littered with macabre and deeply unsettling artefacts is a touch of pure genius. In fact, the film is overflowing with these subtle but very effective touches which all add up to create an atmosphere of high anxiety and dread : Leatherface grunting like a sow, the stifling heat, assorted automobiles hidden under netting and the constant throb of a generator, not to mention the worrying contents of the cook's ovens. It also has the greatest ending to a movie I have ever seen, with Leatherface swinging his chainsaw in the morning light and then a black screen. The music, the characters, the location and the documentary feel of this movie all add up to make it quite simply essential viewing for all horror fans. Watch and marvel...</fullReview>

A lot like the feeling you get when you watch A Clockwork Orange. This could have been Hooper's whole intention of the movie. It might try to give you an uneasy feeling and make you feel like the victims in the movie. Not like other horror movies where the suspense keeps your adrenaline going, this one actually tries to make you feel like the characters.

		<shortDescription>This is one of the scariest film ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tobe Hooper's 1974 classic, "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is quite possibly the scariest movie I have ever seen. It's grainy documentary style makes it a very realistic film. In addition, the fact that there is no real music only helps to drive home the realism. The characters in this film are very real. The five teenagers who unfortunately bump into the clan of cannibalistic crazies are actually very similar in many ways (possibly intentionally) to the gang from "Scooby Doo." Aside from the fact that you are watching a group of kids die one by one at the hands of a man who wears a human face mask, one of the scariest factors of the film is the isolation. For miles and miles, nothing but the baron Texas landscape. The family is probably more terrifying than anything. The family is horrifying. Three brothers living together with their barely alive Grandfather and the rotten corpse of what we assume is their Grandmother. The eldest brother, "The Cook" (we find out in the sequel his name is Drayton) is probably the only way you could survive the situation. He seems to have a conscience. And even says that he doesn't enjoy killing. Therefore, if you eliminated the other 2, you might make it out alive. Especially when you consider that, he runs the gas station at the beginning. If he wanted to kill people, he would have killed them one at a time as they came into the store. "The Hitchhiker" (who in the sequel we learn is called Nubbins) seems to be uncontrollable. Obviously mentally handicapped, his threat is real. You think he is just weird in the beginning, but then as you see, any kind of excitement can and will set him off. Now we are left with the big man, Leatherface (who yet again we learn in the sequel is named Bubba). Leatherface is by far the scariest of the brothers. Leatherface is also one of the scariest characters in film. Leatherface is 6'5" and easily 350 pounds or more. He wears horrible masks made of human flesh and kills with two things, a sledgehammer, and his signature tool, the chainsaw. And by the way folks, THIS NEVER HAPPENED! Do some research and you'll find out for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm officially a vegetarian.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just kidding. But I'm sure this movie is totally capable of doing that to people. I've never felt more uncomfortable watching a horror movie. Frightening scenes and images (especially images) pile up, and make for a movie that is so horrifying, that it actually can make people vegetarian.The plot is barely there. It's about 5 teenagers, who run out of gas in rural Texas, shortly after a creepy encounter with a crazy hitchhiker. They stop at one of their childhood homes, and go exploring. One by one, they wander into the farmhouse next door, which is home to three psychotic cannibal brothers, who are led by the chainsaw wielding maniac, Leatherface. Soon, only Sally (Marilyn Burns) is left, and is frantically on the run from the family.The title is somewhat misleading. The chainsaw is used, that's for sure. But there are only four deaths, and only one of them is with the chainsaw. Also, this movie has no gory scenes. What you see is Leatherface hit someone with a sledgehammer, and you never hear from them again (one of them is put on a meat hook, ends up in the freezer, and that's it). What Leatherface does to his victims is whatever your gruesome imagination wants it to be. The main actress, Marilyn Burns, is very good in her role. Her expression of fear wasn't accurate. It was REAL. She was actually terrified during the filming. The film's most disturbing scene is when she thinks she's going to be helped by the store clerk, but then she sees the meat that's cooking in the barbecue pit. Her face in that scene is perfect for causing discomfort. And the brothers give good performances. They sure know crazy, and their facial expressions are among the most disturbing images you'll ever see. I recommend this terrifying, sweat-inducing film, and give it 8/10.It is rated R for Intense Sequences of Terror/Violence, and Disturbing Images.

		<shortDescription>One of my favourite Horror movies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And I love it! The Texas Chainsaw Masscare, directed by Tobe Hooper is just amazing. I loved the whole atmosphere of the film and it's eerie grim tone that it has to it. Five teenagers on a normal trip out, when, in a nice sunny day, they run into a hitchhiker and they decide to give him a lift. From the first glance of this guy, anyone could tell, he isn't a normal person and far from it. He has what appears to be, a blood stained type scar on around his right cheek. Anyway, the reason he was on the road is because he was visiting the slaughter house..arrgghh. After a bit of a struggle with the Hitchhiker they throw him out of the truck, but that isn't there only worries. After stopping off at an old house, Kirk and Pam run into another house, thinking they maybe could get fuel for the van. And this is were there evening trip turns into a nightmare.On entering this old house, Kirk is confronted by a man with a mask, probably made from human skin. Yes, you have just seen Leatherface! Once Kirk don't come back out, Pam enters the house. And we get to see what type of place this is, Decorations includes, Bones, teeth, feathers, and a general feeling of death in the house. The family consists of "The Cook", "Hitchiker" and "Leatherface" oh, and "Grandpa!". "The Cook" has split personality's, most of the time he is in killing mood, but then his patterns change and he feels guilt in what he has done, and shame. He is conflicted in between, whether he should kill or not. And, He is actually my favourite character out of the film, because his madness is purely evident!. After the other teens be's dealt with, this crew of mad people capture Sally. And in the last 20mins or so of the film, we find out what these screw ups are and what have they lived on, over the past years. There diet appears to be, dead body pieces, fingers as sausages and all sorts. And Sally is the invited guest! The "dinner table scene" is the most memorable scene out of the film. This is were we see, "The Cooks" personalty disorder take effect, cuz, one minute he is laughing at the girl suffer and the next he is shouting "No need to torture the poor girl!", and the most infamous line what he utters "Our old Grandpas the best killer there ever was!". You'll probably want to know does she escape? Well, your gonna have to see it. I think this is the definitive horror movie ever, period. Why? It's so atmospheric, chilling, disturbing, thrilling...everything that a horror movie fan could ask for, if not more. In saying that, the film isn't a real gore hounds film, far from it actually.In fact, there is very little gore at all! And I am being serious, just watch it. And this is the good bit, cuz, when you see it the first time you probably think all sorts happened. But, no, it is the films lack of gore, what made it so good, well, in my opinion anyway. Most of the violence is implied, but it is implied very effectively. And the reason for this is because, Tobe, actually wanted this film to get a 'PG' rating! What was he thinking?!. If your after the best horror out of the 70's, then you have found it! I loved it, and if your an old horror nut (like me), you will too. Enjoy.PS : Give those remakes a break, this is the only TCM you will need.10/10. Unrated: Contains strong implied violence and some bloody violence and torture. Recommended for over 18's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a movie with such a low budget ($140,000) that went on to gross well over $30 million at the box office in 1974, I thought it was filmed masterfully. I just like the way that Tobe Hooper filmed this movie. 5 friends go to a graveyard to find out if their relatives have been disturbed. Two of the five are brother and sister. Franklin the brother is an invalid. Well they find out that everything is fine with their deceased relatives. So all of them go to Franklin's father's old home. Night falls and they uncover a family of cannibals. One of them named Leatherface wields a blood soaked chainsaw. One by one the party of five falls victim to this family of horrors. This film opened a new chapter in the horror genre, and brought horror to a new level, paving the way for such films as Rob Zombie's recent House of 1,000 Corpses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Horror Movie Ever!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE all time horror classic of the last generation, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is the best example of suggested brutal violence. Not once does one see the saw come into contact with flesh on screen, but we all get the image in our mind. The film was banned in Britain until 1998 and when eventually released still managed to scare the spectator.The story, loosely based around the Ed Gein incidents, concerns a vanload of kids who unwisely venture into the Texan wilderness to an empty dilapidated house. Unknown to them, an insane family of cannibals live across the field and one by one they're picked off until only Sally (Burns, who also features in Hooper's other horror, Death Trap) remains. For its period the films was extremely shocking and marked Hooper's debut as horror icon to be reckoned with. Even though the budgets escalated The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is the best film of his career. Hansen's Leatherface is also a nightmarish creation. Never before or since has a single character jangled the nerves ashe chases his prey, screaming and wielding a chainsaw around his head.This recently released extra loaded DVD features a great commentary by Hooper, Hansen and Daniel (cinematographer). They seem quite sadistic in a jolly sort of way, especially as they all laugh gleefully whenever someone is being tortured or harmed on screen. Other features include trailers for all the sequels and an interesting blooper reel and a making of documentary.Made for little money, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre still has the capacity to frighten without graphic violence, proving that sometimes less is definitely more?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film _only_ for the faint-hearted. For the rest, yawn.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know it had no budget. I know it was made way back in 1973. That doesn't change the fact that it is a tedious and annoying film. The background "music" is deafening and obscures the dialogue in many places. The fodder (sorry, _characters_) are zero-dimensional (with the possible exception of the disabled brother). Tension is non-existent. The chainsaw scenes are risible.In mitigation, it is not _completely_ without merit. There are occasional flashes of black humour, and the girl-on-a-meathook scene is the one part which I found genuinely disturbing. That said, I spent about 90% of the film thinking "get on with it".It is supposed to be shocking and disturbing. Unfortunately that is about all that it is. I wasn't shocked and was rarely disturbed so I'm afraid it was just a waste of 83 minutes of my life. I am being generous by giving it 3/10 because it at least tried to inject some black humour into the proceedings, but it wasn't enough to justify enduring the rest of the film. I'm sorry but I just didn't get it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure, unadulterated, 100% blood-curdling cinematic terror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oozing death and decay from its opening frames to its intense and gruelling finale, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a tour de force of raw cinematic horror and one of the finest films ever made. Based on the real life story of Ed Gein, a grave robbing cannibalistic murderer, the movie is a dark journey into the depths of sheer hopelessness and absolute brutality.Made on a shoestring budget by director Tobe Hooper, this 1974 classic of screen terror utilises inventive cinematography combined with a truly ominous soundtrack (but surprisingly little gore), to bring to life the story of five teenagers?Sally, Pam, Jerry, Kirk, and wheelchair-bound Franklin? who stumble upon a charnel house occupied by a family of maniacs.Setting the oppressive tone immediately, Hooper commences his gruesome proceedings with a news report about a spate of grave desecrations in Texas, whilst simultaneously showing us a grisly 'work of art' assembled atop a tombstone, made from the decaying remnants of a freshly exhumed corpse.The 'artist' responsible for this macabre sculpture is a crazy hitchhiker, who is picked up by the unsuspecting group of friends, who are on their way to visit a house (which belongs to the family of one of the girls). The hitchhiker is unceremoniously booted out of the van when he goes bonkers, cutting one of the teens with a razor.But he is not the only lunatic in the area, and it isn't long before the hapless youngsters meet the other members of his murderous family, including the legendary Leatherface, a maniac in a butcher's apron and a human-skin mask with a fondness for heavy-duty power tools! One by one, the teens fall prey to the crazy killers, until only Sally is left; she endures a night of terror at the hands of cannibalistic clan, before making a break for freedom, only to be pursued by the hitchhiker and Leatherface (brandishing his revving chainsaw)...The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a relentless assault on the senses which presents its audience with a series of powerful sequences which are guaranteed to shock and disturb. Whether it's the first victim twitching uncontrollably after being clubbed on the head with a lump-hammer, witnessing the next being hung on a meat-hook or watching poor old Sally being held down to be 'whacked' by a cadaverous old man, the nightmarish images of Hooper's movie will stay with you long after the film has finished.Much imitated, but never bettered, TCM is genuinely worthy of its status as one of the most highly acclaimed horrors of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest horror movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It almost makes me sick to see comments such as "more funny than anything" for a horror classic like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Just because nowadays we have stupid blood soaked THRILLERS/comedies such as "Scream" and "I Know What You Did Last Summer" doesn't lessen the power of this all-time great.Ok, so the movie isn't as controversial as it was in the 70s (you couldn't possibly expect it to be!!) It is however, one of the most influencial horror films ever made.10 out of 10 on this onePS: Stop making fun of true classic horror, kids and throw away your entire Friday The 13th series</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the most horrifying films I have (and will) ever seen. Unlike some other horror projects in the past, this one is based on the true story of Ed Gein, the Wisconsin man who killed people, had some transvestitism (Psycho and Silence of the Lambs were also his creative children), then put their face skin on his (arguabl). The facts are changed around just enough, but that's good because if they showed the real story, people would be puking in the movie theater.The impact of seeing this, even on a small TV screen in my bedroom, at the probably too-tender young age of 12 has never left me. Like Friedkin's Exorcist, Tobe Hooper's gift and intelligence with his film, and what elevates it as grungy, awfully brutal art, is that he doesn't back away from showing us these 'things' ? the house where Leatherface and his meat-eating freak-show of a family live at under the guise of a dad that serves BBQ a town over, is filled with decay and rot and weird skeletons.There's one sequence in fact that just has a girl falling into a room in this house where she and a boy wander to ? cause it's one of 'those' horror films after all, with supposedly dumb kids wandering where they shouldn't, only these are at least moderately smarter and nicer, if no less fatalistic, than the kids in 80's slashers ? and Hooper just shows us this room, almost for a good five minutes of screen time. By the time the Wiley Leatherface shows up it is almost, just *almost* a relief? till the hanging on the meat hook comes around.This is a master's class in atmosphere; originally Hooper, for some odd reason, wanted to get a PG rating (!) for the film. And while it's R is not unearned, it doesn't have nearly as much blood as one might expect, or would think if one sees one of the turgid remakes (I only saw the 2003 film and it left a bad taste not unlike from the Grandpa in this movie's underwear). He trusts that his audience won't like everything they see, and that's the kicker: this is the perpetually "feel-bad" horror film, yet unlike a latter-day movie like Saw, this is one where we do care about what will happen to this girl, her wheelchair-bound brother (annoying as he may be), and there's even a sliver, just a hint, at some social satire with this van of Texas hippies coming upon the backwoods: the deep-fried Texas cannibal holocaust version of Deliverance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was one of a list of films I wanted to see when I turned 18. What a disappointment. The film has no storyline, hardly enough violence to suit an M rating, and an abrupt ending which hardly explained anything. I can see how Tobe Hooper wanted a PG rating for this. As far as horror films go, this one wasn't detailed enough to keep the viewer interested or scary enough for horror buffs. The film has a greater focus on the chase scene then the deaths of 4 teenagers. The one thing I'm thankful for is that there wasn't a sequel. Quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen. There is no explanation of motives, or why there was an abandoned house in the middle of nowhere, and how a pickup truck appeared out of nowhere to save the day. A poor film with no detail.</fullReview>

The movie would be great if the story wasn't so shallow. I really liked the set where they filmed, the house was amazing, full of details. The room where a chicken was locked in a cage when one of girls fell into was fantastic.

		<fullReview>I re watched this recently I don't think it has aged very well at all. This is a review in 2016 and I can say that it has a few good actors, and some awesome atmosphere. However a low budget is very apparent. I also am not a fan of the way the movie was filmed and edited. Every single scene when something is actually happening there is a cut to a different angle and then back to the same one at least 2-3 times and I find it distracting. It's not completely damning but it is annoying. With the awkward editing mostly poor acting, low budget, and a protagonist who's scream sounds like he's stuck in puberty is a much better film enjoyed as a comedy. One thing I will say I like was the ambiance and sound effects they used to replace music. Not a horrible film just hasn't aged very well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Keep in mind that this is all strictly my opinion, and that nothing will ever change my opinion.To me, this film was garbage in pretty much every way. The acting was bad, the villain was ugly in the sense of being cringe-worthy to look at, and the "story" is just about as stupid as they come. The reason I say "stupid" is because the female lead character gets pulled into this incident simply because she does, not because she's related to the cannibals or any other logical reason.The idea of Leatherface wearing a mask made from human flesh would seem like it should be scary. Sure, the concept is, but his actual appearance is anything but. I understand that he is supposed to be ugly, but he is ugly in the sense of being ugly for what he is, not ugly because he's supposed to be ugly, if you know what I mean. Then there's the scene where Leatherface is dressed up like a woman... Don't even get me started on that abominable atrocity.I've never been a slasher fan, and this film certainly didn't help change my perspective on the genre for the better. The fact that this film is considered one of the greatest horror movies of all time and a masterpiece sickens me. It also makes me think that there must have been a major lack of genuine entertainment in theatres in the year 1974. I feel sorry for the hundreds of people who wasted hours of their life watching this horrible film, and for the people who still re-watch this film and thus waste more of their time. Since I basically despised this film prior to watching it, I found myself fast-forwarding through a lot of the scenes. I wasn't about to waste my time watching this garbage in its entirety.This film is worth 2 out of 5 stars and nothing more. The story is lame, the villain is ugly, and the entire concept in general is just God awful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some effective horror scenes but the movie lacks a purpose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't like the start of this film. It didn't excite or engage me and I started to worry that it was going to be awful. The characters are uninteresting and they don't come across as being very intelligent. They fit into the tired old cliché of horny teenagers casually wandering off in the middle of nowhere basically asking to be kidnapped or killed. They run out of gas and choose to go to an old house some of them grew up in. Never mind the possibility that other people might now be living in or around the house.The movie starts to get more interesting. It uses suspense quite well. We get shots of them from the distance, among the grass, suggesting they might be being watched, that they're vulnerable. There is a loud machine going on a farm, a nice precursor to the constant sound of the chainsaw later on.Once the horror begins, it's very effective. It's abrupt, raw, brutal and shocking. It's not surprising this film was banned in so many countries. But it doesn't show that much blood. It's what it implies and how quickly and casually everything happens that affects the audience. There's no warning, no cat jumping out, no friends bumping into each-other. We don't cut away but we see a person's limp body as they breathe their final breaths.The design of the interior of the house is very interesting and original. Bones, feathers, weird symbolic token things, a chicken, sitting corpses. Filmed in weird angles and as if the rooms were themselves alive.The soundtrack is also very unique and enhances the atmosphere a huge amount. It's not conventional "music" but is rather a soundscape of vibrations, animal sounds, echoing tribal instruments, I don't even know. It puts us in a different world, a different mindset, a waking nightmare I suppose.There's something comical about a screaming woman being constantly chased by a madman with a chainsaw. At first you can empathise with her terror but when the pursuit continues for what seems like at least 10 minutes, it begins to feel more like a Benny Hill sketch. When he's on her tail, I understand she's screaming out of desperate fear. But when she gets her chances and buys herself a little bit of time, she doesn't focus and come up with a plan, she just keeps loudly screaming and flailing about, running painfully slowly, nearly falling over every 3 steps.This movie pretends to be based on a real story which is just really lame and dishonest. If you have to manipulate your audience to get a response from them, that's a bad sign.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has some fun scares and dark horror moments. It has a consistent lo-fi style that starts out annoying but works well by the end. The last shot has a visceral energy that seems to pop out of the screen. But the movie lacks humour, social commentary, science fiction, character arcs, any kind of other element to elevate it above being just a horror movie.Some of the last scenes are disturbing (and well-acted). Having weird strangers laugh at you and mock your screams is pretty messed up. Not to mention being powerless and not knowing if you're going to die or not. But do we need to see this? Is this really entertainment?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974): Dir: Tobe Hooper / Cast: Marilyn Burns, Paul A. Partain, Edwin Neal, Gunnar Hansen, Teri McMinn: Disturbing horror film based on true events. It regards a van load of young folks traveling to Texas to check on a grave site after reports of grave robbing. Central plot regards the search for gas and the farm house that homes a family of cannibals including the makeup wearing, chainsaw swinging hulking Leatherface. The first big problem here is that, with the exception of Marilyn Burns, these kids are cardboard. Burns is our vision into terrifying events that include being bound, gagged and held in position to be knocked over the head by grandpa. She spends a lot of time running and screaming and viewers can feel her trauma. While her friends are not interesting the villains steal their moments including Edwin Neal as a deranged hitchhiker, and Gunnar Hansen as the infamous Leatherface whose whirling chainsaw craze is our last witness. Teri McMinn plays the famed victim who is impaled on a meat hook and later found barely alive in a freezer. While story is thin director Tobe Hooper creates realism to the highest degree including a shrine of bones that leads one victim to a nasty hook impalement. This is quite tasteless and certainly not for everyone but Hooper's documentary feel render this film the stuff of nightmares. Score: 6 ? / 10</fullReview>

It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. It is very intense. I need more lines and I am running out of things to say. This is a great movie.

		<fullReview>This film really reduces horror to its essence: a group of young people who get a prophecy of what is to come when a weirdo ends up in their van, ignore it, stop in the wrong place, and get killed gruesomely by a family of redneck degenerates.The plot is almost irrelevant, as the movie is all about atmosphere and the relentlessness of death. Unlike many other horror movies, some of the death scenes are sudden and almost banal, such as the unexpected sledgehammer to a victim's head. It has an eerie feeling of realism and inevitability to it that most horror flicks can only strive for.There are many scenes of sadistic infliction of pain and suffering, from people on meat hangers to people who can't quite get offed by grandpa, to weak to wield a hammer to bash in a skull. It's certainly not for the faint of heart. Also, there's always a (scarier than the movie) contingent of movie theatre patrons who laugh when people get killed at such films, but they will tend to be mostly quiet for this film. (And if not, be sure to avoid them in a dark alley after the film ends.)This film has no pretenses, and is a far superior precursor to the 'reality' films a la "Blair Witch.' Like other excellent horror films, it aged well and thus is also good as a 70s period piece. If this movie does not make you cringe, feel sorry for its victims, and then feel relief that it's not you in there, I don't know what will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is the greatest horror movie that ever has been! The way the movie is filmed enables a person to be completely immersed as though they were watching a documentary. It became the template of many movies to follow after it. It is 40 years old yet holds up to this day. What an achievement. Leatherface is an iconic movie monster and rightfully so. I have watched this movie countless times and it still makes the hairs on my skin stand up. It's hard to believe that a movie has the ability to do such a thing seeing that it is completely fictional but it does indeed do that.

The first time I saw THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE was at a Midnight showing, and the ominous opening moments were enough to put me on edge (the briefly-glimpsed photos of the cemetery desecrations had me convinced that I was about to see a snuff film), but it was the off-the-wall humor that (momentarily) set my mind at ease.

All of the things that we hear about this movie are exaggerated. First of all, there is not that much shocking horror here. The body count is small, and the killing has very little blood. Furthermore, the overall atmosphere of the movie is not as scary as the stills of the movie make it look. Much of the running time is nothing more than build-up, and only a little bit of the running time delivers anything substantial. Overall, it was boring, and is, in my opinion, overrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gets my vote for best horror film of the 70s--no small feat!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 70s was really a golden age for horror cinema as the 1980s slasher craze was obviously still in the future. Most horror films made in this decade were actually about something--there was subtext and a social commentary running beneath the murders, making us question our values and, in the case of American films, the dark undercurrents of the modern American family. It was a daring time to be a filmmaker and the best of the genre took advantage of a decade that wasn't hampered by strict moral codes forced on productions and used the changing attitudes to become pioneers of a new type of horror film, one far removed from the conservative 1960s, where only names like Polanski were breaking any new ground.So, in a decade filled with such new "blood" so to speak, to stand out as the cream of the crop even 40 years later is no small feat, but that's exactly what I think this film is--the best representation of where horror cinema was going in the 70s and still the best genre fare that innovative decade has to offer.This isn't just a proto-slasher film about a bunch of stranded kids being chainsawed to death on the back roads of Texas. Filmed when the national gas crisis was making headlines at the time, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre runs deep with subtext. The fact it manages to be a profound commentary on the time it was made without becoming overtly obvious while still managing to be scary and mainstream enough to not qualify as an art house film says something about the many levels the film works on. This isn't a one-dimensional horror tale about cannibalism--an easy topic to promote tasteless horror and mined to death in lesser films.As a native of Texas, the cinematography perfectly captures the landscape I've grown accustomed to seeing and highlights the more sinister aspects just below the surface that is genuinely felt when on those deserted highways on a hot summer afternoon in August. It's not easy to capture beauty and a sense of unease at the same time--this film does it.The remarkably innovative sound effects go a long way to increase tension in key moments of the film, with the opening credits in particular being an exercise in fear themselves. For a film to unnerve you during the credits is a testament to the talent involved here.Even more remarkable is how nothing in the film feels exploitative. In a film called "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre", who would expect the film to not utilize buckets of gore like some Herschell Gordon Lewis film? Because the fact is, despite the film's notorious reputation as a splatter film, like Hitchcock's shower scene in "Psycho", there is very little violence actually seen on screen. Most of it is implied or imagined due to Hooper's inventive use of camera angles and visual manipulation. Did you actually just SEE a woman impaled on a meat hook? Look again.What the film does best is evoke a prolonged feeling of dread. From the very first moments, nothing quite feels right here. We've got kids out on a typical summer afternoon drive, but one can't shake the feeling that something terrible is about to happen. Hooper uses many techniques to evoke a feeling of constant paranoia and anxiety in the audience, from his use of long panoramic visuals to the oppressive heat the characters are experiencing that the audience can almost feel. The scenes in a hot van make one feel claustrophobic as if they're actually sitting there with these characters sweating it out. Good horror films know atmosphere, and this one has it in spades. It's also a perfect example of how to pace yourself. There are no gory murders to be had every ten minutes--this is not a "Friday the 13th" film.By the time the murders actually begin, it's almost a relief, as the culmination of all that tension offers some temporary relief...at least until the next horrific situation.Beautiful to look at, masterful in its use of location and its manipulation of audience fear, "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" is a landmark horror film that fully deserves it's re-release this summer (2014), if only to remind theatergoers what a true classic is and wash the taste of the over-produced Platinum Dunes remake out of their mouths. This is truly one of the most groundbreaking horror films of the 20th century and it's importance in the genre and the entire world of film itself should not be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tobe Hooper's beginning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something about the title of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and how people think of it. Many just think of it of being about a chain saw wielding killer who stalks people and cuts them up for fun. However, that is just skimming the surface of this particular horror franchise. What some may not realize about this story is that there is more than one could expect to see - and that doesn't include scares. There's another aspect about this movie that first time director Tobe Hooper included that will have the audiences baffled, stunned and amazed. That aspect is the sheer bizarre atmosphere that is this film.Viewers will follow the path of five friends who are on the road, heading toward a relative's house. On their way, they run low on fuel and look for a place to rest for the night. What they don't know, is that they're not going to see the light of day. Unbeknownst to them, something, a danger so unspeakable is headed their way that quite frankly if anyone ran into, should high tail it out of there. This danger is a family of psychotically deranged cannibals that have no conceivable conscience. But, the most deadly individual is the man (if he is one) known as "Leatherface".This guy is not to be messed with. He is the towering, chain saw wielding killer and can this beast run! Strangely enough, he and the rest of his cohorts were the ones who were given the most attention to when it came to character development. The audience actually gets to understand his place in the family and how the overall family acts. This is also a major flaw. With the antagonists more developed, this left our main characters on the sidelines and are basically only fodder for Leatherface. Sure, audiences' will understand that they're friends but what else is there to learn? Not much else - or at least from what's given to us. Along with that is a rather underwelming plot. There really isn't much of a plot at all. Friends travel and end up running into the goons. Not much else. There are a few twists but nothing that wasn't too oddball or unpredictable.However, in place of this is the bizarre aspect that was mentioned earlier, credited to Tobe Hooper. The way of life that takes place with these killers are something to behold. It will make the viewer question to themselves, "Who enjoys this kind of thing?". It's that bizarre. Another element that viewers should enjoy is how the movie pushes the endurance meter. To see how long one can watch the screen without turning away or closing their eyes is a serious plus. Adding to this is how little music is in the running time. It is almost to the point of completely absent, yet when it is heard, it's distinct. Still, it should've been more prevalent because there were areas that could've used the emphasis of terror. With all this, it still amounts to a decent horror film.It's surprising that with uneven character development, lackluster music and a very thin plot, that this movie made the impact it did and will for future viewers. With an atmosphere and characters so bizarre, it's hard not to sit down and wonder how things will turn out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not the murders, it' the atmosphere that surrounds it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is the only film in my memory that creates an atmosphere that is comparable to rotten meat. Believe it or not, I mean that as a compliment. There's a lot of death and decay in this movie, a lot of rotten, messy decomposition. What is unsettling is that this atmosphere of rot and decay fills long silences in which nothing seems to be happening, we wait and wait for it to lead somewhere. Unfortunately, it finally does. For me, the long silences are scarier than a chainsaw.I've begun to realize the best of the horror genre seems to subsist on atmosphere when it comes up short on having a story to tell. Atmosphere can breed many things, many emotions, many fears. That's especially true when your movie persists on little more than a pudgy maniac wielding a chainsaw. The very best thing about this movie is that it never seems to feel like someone made a movie. Shot on a low budget My memories of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" seem to have been filled with buzzing saw noises and sudden bursts of violence that well up about of nearly dead quiet. What had slipped my mind, in the years since I first saw the film was that, for much of the time, there seems to be almost no sound at all. Those moments, to be quite honest, are far more potent than a woman hanging from a meat hook. This is a gross, desolate, grisly and unsettling little film in which the horror seems to come from nowhere.The story you know: Five kids in a van are driving across the ass-end of Texas looking for their grandfather's old house. They pick up a hitchhiker who seems two tacos short of a combination plate. When he cuts one of their number on the leg, they dump in on the road. The obvious question, why don't they turn around? The answer: they can't ? they don't know where they are going. In a pattern that would follow nearly ever horror film for the next four decades, the group splits up. All eventually arrive at the same farmhouse.What follows is gruesome, nasty beyond repulsive. The kids find a weird family whose chili recipe contains an ingredient not approved by the FDA. They are killed one by one by a pudgy, chainsaw wielding freak in a mask made of human skin. When there is one kid left, she is taken into their home and tormented. She, and we, are shocked by the state of the place wherein everything is made of human bones and bound in human skin. It's sickening, nauseating and, in its own way, a weird masterwork of art direction. This house could be an antechamber in Dante's Inferno.Yet, for all the violence, this is essentially a bloodless film. Many murders happen off-screen and your mind creates what the screen isn't showing us ? in a way that's worse. Yet, it isn't the violence that stays with you, it's the desolation and nausea created by the setting. The landscapes they are traveling through should tell them everything they need to know. The sides of the road are overgrown with weeds and dead trees. When they go looking for the house, the sparse scattering of houses seems to be rotted, apparently abandoned long ago. For long stretches of time, there is no violence, no monsters, just dirt and decay. We wait and wait for something. Somehow, it's more effective that way.*** (of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkably Well-Made Horror Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gotta say that this movie was totally frightening and astounding! Many people might think that this film is just a trash because of the crappy remakes but trust me, this film is so well made, probably the best horror film after 1973s The Sisters (At least to me). Making you surprised by the loud sound effects are NOT scary. For example, your friend surprises you by pushing you suddenly or something like that doesn't mean that the friend is scary. Many modern films are like that. Just making you surprise by appearing suddenly. But in this film it's different. It creeps you out just by pure director's talent. See, Tobe Hooper truly has a talent. He is like a man born to make horror film which is the opposite of modern director who makes shitty horrors. It really will creep you out, not by surprising scenes but really scary scenes. How scary is it? A LOT. Actually this is the first film that I thought that it is scary enough. The last scene when the girl escapes from the creepy family, it feels like we had escaped from the nightmare which is very remarkable.If you want to see something scary, and you really want to taste the true taste of horror, THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE 1973 IS WAITING FOR YOU!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sophomoric and predictable: SPOILERS!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are 5 things that make this film watchable:1) The thrashing about of the first victim after he was clubbed 2) When the hitchhiker gets turned into roadkill 3) 83 minute run time 4) Grandpa trying unsuccessfully to put Sally down...and most importantly,5) Sally's ever present fantastic boobsThe rest is pretty sophomoric and predictable: Hey look! There is a hitchhiker that looks crazy as a loon. Let's pick him up! A spooky old house in the middle of nowhere. Let's go inside! All of the kids end up going to a strange old house where they get knocked off one by one. Sally may be in great shape but she can't seem to outrun an overweight chainsaw wielding inbred hillbilly/redneck psycho. Sally screams throughout the final half hour of the movie.Jim Siedow as the cook, and Edwin Neal as the hitchhiker do well in their rolls but everyone else seem like extras that got speaking parts. 4 points out of 10. Possibly 6 points out of 10 if this was 1974. Totally overrated film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was pretty good for a seventies film and I love the series but it's not terrifying like everyone says. I'm a 14 year old guy and this didn't really even phase me. My favorites are definitely Two and Four and Texas Chainsaw. Part four was hilarious. Part three wasn't as good to me because I don't care that much about the whole family thing. TCM is a horror film not a drama. To me I liked Texas Chainsaw because it gave us Leatherface chasing people around not Chop Top and the Cook and Hitchhiker. Anyways, It's a good film but everyone is calling it pure terrifying, I don't think it is. If you like Texas Chainsaw series you'll, of course, love this one because its the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A landmark, masterwork for the genre, that is unfit for any star rating.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a viciously brutal exercise in horror, yet can be considered one of the early masterworks of the genre that paved the way for the slasher character to take effect along with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. It accentuates a low-budget, gritty feeling of dread by not only dropping us into a seamy, hot climate, but giving us group of characters whom we intimately focus on in the beginning before left to mourn their deaths by the rolling of the credits.Our story is slim, like many horror films, centering around a group of five friends that venture out to the countryside to investigate reports of a grave being defiled. The grave in question belongs to Sarah (Marylin Burns) and her paraplegic brother's (Paul A. Patain) grandfather, and upon finding the grave, they intend to explore an old family home that belonged to one of Sarah's relatives, which is where they encounter Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen), a vicious, masked killing with a chainsaw as a weapon of choice and his family of sociopathic, cannibalistic murderers that unleash their unbelievably gruesome fury on the five innocent victims.Tobe Hooper gives us time to spend with these characters, more-so than I was expecting. the scenes with the hitchhiker, who they pick up early in their excursion just to discover he's a sick, twisted soul, give us roughly fifteen minutes of dialog, only necessary to the viewer that wants their deaths to have a bit more of a "pang" effect. It is when you explore horror cinema of the 1970's and 1980's do you realize what is sorely lacking from the genre in today's time. Not only are we given significantly less films of the genre today, but we are subjected to gimmicky "advances" such as 3D, lame scenes of torture, no characters, stock villains, excessive gore, and, worst of all, not the slightest shred of consuming dread or suspense.At least we can say with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, we were provided with what would serve as long term building blocks for the horror genre. To argue over which slasher film implemented the best style and worked the best is entirely subjective and open for some strong debate. Contrasting, say, John Carpenter's Halloween is a difficult one, seeing as while it was still a slasher film, just in the genre's very early state, it was polished, complete, and looked almost like a project along the lines of seventies film noir. Not a gory, brutal horror film to which it would appear.Hooper uses grit and realism to portray his atmosphere, while Carpenter used stylistic measures and defining camera angles. Both films share the characteristic of a low budget, while Halloween ($325,000) chose to use it in a more cleaned up, stylish way, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, shot for less than $300,000 on 16mm, chose to heavily utilize film grain, slow moving video, and a lot of rough, scratchy sound.Probably the most noticeable use of the scratchy sound comes during the end sequence, when we hear a lot of blood-curdling screams and shrieks of terror. This is when The Texas Chainsaw Massacre becomes alive, showing not only the gruesome torture, but showing it in a way that is unnerving to the audiences. This was one of the first times we felt like voyeurs in the audience; witnesses to crime that went unsolved and unpunished, and we just sat there and took it in. Shame on us? The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a landmark, masterwork for the genre, unfit for any star rating I can think of. I'll compromise at three; for a film this unique, gratifying, and truly horrific, a star rating should be the least of anyone's concern.Starring: Marilyn Burns, Paul A. Partain, Edwin Neal, Allen Danzinger, Jim Siedow, William Vail, Teri McMinn, and Gunnar Hansen. Directed by: Tobe Hooper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Homicide on it's brain...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to start by saying that The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is not just one of the greatest horror movies of all time but one of the greatest movies of all time. Intriguing but uncomfortable viewing from the off, it is genuinely one of the most admirable pieces of cinema ever made. Of course for some present day first time viewers it may seem a little dated but for any movie connoisseur it is a treat (or nightmare) of a film with very few peers.I will forever remember the first time I watched TTCM and whilst it scared the pants off of me, I immediately fell in love with it. Quite simply TTCM succeeds in doing exactly what it was made to do. To make you feel nauseous, claustrophobic, stressed, upset, hot, sweaty, scared and in the end, mentally exhausted.A low budget production and shot in sweltering conditions in the Texan dessert (100 deg +), even the infamous dinner scene which gives the impression of night, was shot during the day with black curtains used throughout the house to give the effect of darkness. It's details like this which give TTCM the kind of character and unique ID that generally only low budget or old, classic movies can provide.The score for the film is unsettling (pots and pans being bashed) but ultimately just adds to the terrifying and almost unbearable atmosphere throughout. Having watched it the first time one of the main things that I couldn't get my head around was, why the BBFC had banned TTCM from British viewing after its initial release? A decision which is just as ridiculous today as it must have been back then. Because whilst TTCM is infamous in part for it's brutality, there is hardly any bloody moments and no lavish graphic violence, it is all in the mind and psychological. Which is something that many modern day movies (especially horrors) lack the intelligence to succeed in doing.I don't want to spoil any of the film content itself, I just wanted to give people who haven't seen the film, hopefully a slightly different insight to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Many films will try and be TTCM but ultimately, they will fail and there will always only be one. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Seeing a murder on television can help work off one's antagonisms. And if you haven't any antagonisms, the commercials will give you some." ? Alfred HitchcockTobe Hooper's "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" follows a group of young people on a road trip across rural Texas. En route they unwittingly become victims to a family of hook, knife and chainsaw wielding ex-slaughterhouse workers. Hooper's narrative is typical of horror movies ? moments of tense build-up followed by shocks and releases ? but the style employed was at the time wholly original: extreme close ups, remote long shots, telephoto lenses which lend the film a documentary air, raw cinematography, pseudo naturalistic acting, creepy architecture, demented decor (animal skulls, lampshades made of human flesh etc), sickening sets which fetishize poverty, grime and sleaze (a precursor to "Seven") and a narrative that is minimalist, lacks closure and unfolds in near real-time. Mario Bava, George Romero and Herschell Gordon Lewis are the chief influences.The film was released at a time of social and political upheaval. The Nixon administration was taking heat, reports of American atrocities in Vietnam were now becoming old news, Charles Manson was on the mind, murder sprees were in vogue, gas was in shortage and America's "silent majority" was beginning to resist civil rights movements, second wave feminism and any possibility of social transformation. In this regard, academics tend to read "Chainsaw" as they did Romero's "Night of the Living Dead". Here was another film, either consciously or not, about an ongoing culture war: a demented, deeply patriarchal, deeply religious, old school, red neck family unit terrorising a group of sexual libertines, teenagers, paraplegics and hippies; the old, clinging to declining familial and social structures, resisting the new. In this light, the slaughterhouse psychos, who mount their excursions from a Jeffersonian/antebellum frontier home, are tied to an American fascination with meat, war, murder and blood sacrifice. With the release of Hooper's subsequent films, and affiliations with Spielberg, "high brow" readings of the film then quickly did a hilarious 180. Horror films typically pit the Other vs Normalcy, and so now, suddenly, here was a film about poor working class butchers pushed into cannibalism and violence because "the pumps are empty", "we people are being treated like cattle" and "sales are down". The film was now seen to be "bad" because it demonized the proletariat, the outsider, the poor, the unemployed, the lower class red neck mountain man, who's "weird" and "gross", and god knows what those inbreeding, inhuman folk are doing up there in the hills.It's highly unlikely that Hooper intended any of this. He just wanted to scare. Still, the links between political and popular cultures are about as complex as the links between our dreams and the anxieties that haunt our waking lives. What the myriad of readings "Chainsaw" incurs show, if anything, is how effortlessly innocent groups and subsets are scapegoated and pitted against one another, and how the binary thinking of most supposedly "topical" horror films serve only to obfuscate history and ignore real monsters."The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" set in stone the formula that subsequent slasher movies would follow. Like Hitchcock's "Psycho", its villains are based on Ed Gein, a Wisconsin man with a preponderance for corpse exhumation, murder and mutilation. The film may be crude, silly, god-awful and dumb in places, but it also has a uniquely raw tone, some good passages and many unique images. It ends with a tuxedo wearing, chainsaw wielding masked man, framed by a rising sun, flailing his weapon in demented circles. The guy's upset. His victim's escaped. Odd for a horror movie, none of the villains are killed, captured or even subjected to much resistance.8/10 ? Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brooding menace infused underground horror classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although not an "official" video nasty in the sense of having been on the list drawn up by the Director of Public Prosecutions in England in the early 80s (having already been banned by the BBFC in the mid 70s) the reputation "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" had for those of us growing up in the 80s and 90s was indeed of a film so brutal and violent that to watch it would almost certainly result in traumatisation for life. As such, as an adolescent weaned on extreme horror, I salivated at the lifting of the ban in the UK in the late 90s and the news it would be given a TV screening. And so?one fateful evening I sat down and braced myself. Afterwards, I was left with a distinct feeling of "meh".Looking back, this was a na?ve response owing a lot to having expected a lot of gory Tom Savini-style kills and an inflated body count which I had seen so much of in countless other slashers (which "Texas?", released the same year as "Black Christmas" and "Silent Night, Bloody Night", is considered an early example of). However, with subsequent re-watches I came to appreciate that while the film isn't gore heavy (and only one victim is actually off-ed with a chainsaw) instead the strength of the movie is in its ominous sense of lurking dread which builds from portentous stirrings upto its hysterical, frenzied Leatherface-flailing-about-with-a-chainsaw finale. Indeed, so pervasive is this atmosphere that BBFC chief censor James Ferman banned it on the grounds that whichever way he cut the film the stifling claustrophobic terror remained.As such, in combination with being (slightly) less parodied and milked by franchises than other notable slasher entries, this lack of gore in preference to claustrophobia has meant it has aged fairly well (as nothing dates quicker than special effects and fake blood). The film also has quite a strong sense of believability due to its low budget influenced quasi-documentary style, its inspiration from real life serial killer Ed Gein (who also served as the inspiration for "Psycho"), that the fact that the shooting was characterised by time constraints, searing heat, and the stench of rotting animal flesh which made a lot of the hysteria seen on screen more real than would be expected.All told, I'm sure some will still try to sniffy and say it's dated, rubbish, and not scary etc. but frankly they're missing the point. The movie was and remains an underground horror classic which, along with "Night of the Living Dead" and "Halloween", not only has the prestige of having shaped subsequent generations of horror movies, but which can still go toe-to-toe with any of today's offerings when it comes to a crushing sense of primal terror.</fullReview>

It's some psychological stuff.the movie doesn't just jump into gore straight away like other slasher flicks, it builds up tension for about 30 minutes and even though those 30 minutes aren't that scary and not a lot happens it has a creepy atmosphere that makes you sense that something bad is going to happen and eventually it does.Leatherface was a very creepy villain with that mask he wears, and the scenes where he chases after his victims with the chainsaw are really tense, especially the nighttime scene where he is chasing after Sally after murdering Franklin. this film delivers pretty much everything you would ask for in a horror movie, an unbearable tension buildup, a good atmosphere and a memorable villain that will haunt you long after the movie has finished, good job Tobe Hooper</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" is a cutthroat, unendingly bleak masterpiece of horror cinema, one that wears its depravity on its sleeve and isn't without a historical context?Vietnam, peace-loving hippies, the Manson cult and subsequent slayings?to hook its narrative upon. Stimulating in its breathless, brutal nature, unnerving in its out-of- control thematic awfulness, the film finally forces you into Sally's shoes, pushing her insufferable brother in his wheelchair through the underbrush, hopelessly calling out her friends' names in the blackness of night, and then witnessing her wall of security come toppling down with the onslaught of Leatherface and his buzzing chainsaw. The climax, depicting Sally's hellish experiences in the hours before dawn as she screams bloody murder and struggles to stay alive amidst a kaleidoscope of iniquity incarnate and one particularly unsavory dinner, is emotionally draining and, for lack of a better word, unimaginably horrific.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frightening And Gripping!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You may not be swept in by the rather clichéd storyline of this film, but once you watch it, the point of return will have been sealed, and your mind will be lost in a realm of chaotic disturbance.Five young adults travel through rural Texas, only to fall victim to a bloodthirsty chainsaw wielding serial killer. OK, sounds typical, but you cannot judge a book by its cover.All I could say about this is...WOW! The Texas Chain Saw Massacre by Tobe Hooper is definitely one of the most legendary slasher movies in history, and one of the best movies in the 1970's. It also has birthed a well-known figure in horror, Leatherface. But what is it you ask, that made this movie fantastic? It was predominantly the relentless strikes dealt by the dark and intense atmosphere. Tobe Hooper has used natural elements of the environment of a rural Texas, and projected it to intimidate the audience. The sparse lands of the Texan desert and the tension of the night were effectively put into play to define suspense. Suspense is an important matter in horror films, and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre allows you to experience fear first-hand! The movie has several gripping scenes, perhaps the most engaging part was when Sally (portrayed by Marilyn Burns) was running from Leatherface after he brutally dismembered Sally's handicapped brother in one of the most ensuing chases I've ever witnessed.What has been especially gripping was the complete lack of a musical soundtrack. It was substituted for very eerie sound effects, which were very abundant during the chase scene, and throughout the film. The impact of was so immediate and made you realise how fear can be shaped into many different ways to toy with your mind.Unlike its worthless remake, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre featured minimal blood, but disturbing violence, especially in the scene where Leatherface pummels Kirk's forehead with a sledgehammer. It reinforces how you don't need gore to be frightened. And that is what really impressed me about it. The movie is loaded with, and ready to burst with suspense, the species which keeps your eyes adhered to the screen.I found The Texas Chain Saw Massacre to be one of the best and most influential slasher movies ever made, and I strongly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a fright. Just don't sue me if you become mentally disturbed by it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The wonderful thing about the crazed young horror filmmakers from the 70s and 80s is that they weren't self-conscious. These days in order to get a film made, most filmmakers have this mistaken notion that it has to be all polished and ever-so-perfectly crafted. And if possible, have studio backing and at least one name star. But back in the early 70s, Tobe Hooper and his posse chose to go down to Texas and make an unhinged tale of a very bizarre family. And it's the film that introduced the world to Leatherface. Based loosely on the exploits of Ed Gein, we follow a van full of young people who are traveling down a hot, dusty back road. Unlike a lot of movies since then, the filmmakers wisely decide to reveal little about the characters. Normally, that would make them come across as wooden or paper-thin, but not in this case. The shocking revelation of this film is that the aforementioned crazed family kill travelers and turn them into food, clothing and furniture. Several times in the film, we are shown footage from slaughter houses and slowly it dawns on you that we're viewing the characters the same way the killers do: as meat and nothing more. The grisly effects on display aren't nearly as graphic as viewers and critics at the time made it out to be. But what it lacks in full-blown visuals, it heaps on dollops of creepiness and depravity. This film is not for the squeamish in any way. And please don't get me started with the sequels or that god-awful remake. But do make an effort to see this low budget shocker to see what filmmakers could do without the help of studios, stars or even polish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" is an indeed classic of the horror genre. I went to see this expecting the lowest, since these old horror films tend to be very lame and bad produced.This film has many accomplishments that I really didn't expect. First, we have an amazing cast that delivers to the spectator many things. Marilyn Burns is very believable in her screams and her natural reactions to fight "death". The whole family is insane and the actors make a good job in portraying sick people. Their actions are so sadistic that make the film becomes painfully to watch. And more than that, the director builds a truly horrifying atmosphere without even showing gore. Instead of gore, he preferred to use psychological torture along with a creepy atmosphere sound and directing which agonizes and disturbs more than any gore in this world.My only complain about this film is the small budget; with such a good director it had, they could and should have invest more money in this picture. The photography is very poor and it gets too dark in many times, so the spectator loses many facial expressions and movements. I found that this photography's bad quality ruins some things, but doesn't spoil the film's overall quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Independent horror movie is sick, screwed up, and crazy, but in a way still fun to watch. An original title known throughout the horror genre, continued with sequels, as well as remakes, and a prequel. Character development, plot, or editing doesn't mean much to this film. For it, its just being the most intense and darkened chaotic terror you can bring, which is exactly what it does.Five friends in Texas, after a terrorizing encounter with a psychotic hitch hiker, arrive at a house belonging to their grandpa. Not too long after they arrive, a chainsaw wielding psycho named Leatherface, kills off the teenagers one at a time, leaving one left to fight for her life, and insanity after she's brought to his home with his younger brother, (the hitchhiker), and their dad, a gas station attendant they met earlier.Not very long, or just doesn't feel very long, it doesn't wait around for the killing to begin at all. Similar to a Friday the 13th sequel, they arrive, and are killed off. Except this movie does it better. The killings aren't too graphic. The main terror comes from the last three- fourths of the movie.Didn't really care for it too much. Wasn't bad, wasn't good either. Not much suspense really, and the some of the scenes are overly extended, which could be replaced by better scenes. But all together, it is a classic horror film, praised by many.Very psychological, and intended for those who appreciate the terror of horror films, and not the gore. For any gore fans looking for a bloody taste of gore, this movie won't do you any good.</fullReview>

And I was forever mesmerized by the movie, one day I run into it special edition, re-mastered, the whole bit, for three bucks how could I say no.Anyways to the review, first of all, you could tell this is a low-budget movie, but aren't those the best, well the film looks like it was taped by a home video camera, but it gives it style, almost this realistic feel to it. But some scenes are so dark you can't even see what's going on. The natural lighting does well on some scenes, especially in the last one, and does poorly in others.The acting for the teens is hit and miss, but the performances of the family is just top to the line, the cook/gas man is really good.Some of the characters get under your skin like some kid in the wheelchair, man is his voice annoying. The family are a bunch of freak-a-zoids. the famous scene with the family in the dinner table was just so weird and freaky I loved it but, I had a problem with the movie it just wasn't scary I never jumped, yelled "ohhh!!!" never did the hide the screen with the knee but it still looks like I'm watching the move thing. I just felt well that sucks for them.another thing, it's probably due to all the new movies with gore and all that, well you don't see people get chopped up with that chainsaw leather face would only wave it around to make it look like he is cutting threw them, but you don't get fooled. The reason I give it a 7-10 is because I expected more from it like, super scary.**super spoiler** when the hitch hiker(that weirdo) is chasing the sole survivor down the street and then that trailer runs him over looked surprisingly good, almost real, i don't know how they did it. it is also very satisfying to see that bastard go!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are movies that scare you, and there are some that bruise you. This movie is the latter. usually i don't get scared watching a horror movie but this one passed right through me..It was 83 minutes of trauma. Guys if you are out there trying to watch it, then better gather some friends. The plus point with horror movies is that the flaws of camera, lighting, cinematography, sound mixing turn out to favor the aura of the movie. the weirder these stuffs are, the better the movie gets. i wouldn't give a damn to what way the actors acted because it was overshadowed by their screaming. At least 80% of the time strip is only made of screams. Well it worked out to be a perfect prime-time for a horror movie bulimic. i would say the the Texas Chainsaw Massacre has what it takes to be a good horror flick. although i would advice you guys not to eat anything while the movie goes on..it will not help. and just to hit the bell, this one is way better than the wrong turn-like gory flicks that are interspersed with nothing but mannequin heads and legs. watch if you are a gore movie buff but like the mutilated details hidden.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some facts are ignored but they are still facts. Fact: this film changed cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am astonished by this film. It has been copied so many times. Of course the formula was there before Texas Chainsaw Massacre existed but never utilised in such a nightmarish way as this. I first watched it on a bad VHS on an equally bad TV set and ever since I have been a fan. The violence and gore do seem tame in comparison to films like Martyrs, Srpski Film e.t.c. but the atmosphere is unique and daring even still. There are sequences where the essence of a nightmare is obtained effortlessly, it seems, with no famous actors, high budget set, orchestra score or extensive special effects. The most charming aspect of this film for me is the pure artistic endeavour. A tree with hundreds of watches nailed to it, a horn through a sheep skull, a leather mask. These are all inspired stand-alone images that, to me, hint at a world beyond the constraints of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Superb is all i can say about this film superb. I saw this movie the first time in 1997 when i was seven and finally this summer i got my hands on a collectors item and saw it again, Superb is all i can say. The story tells of five teens who are going to one of theirs grandpas home when they run out of gas and wonder off to the territory of leatherface a evil killer and his family. The camera was a nice touch that really hooked me up on the film. The two females in the film are very good looking.The character in the wheelchair gave the film a nice touch it gave a real sense. The killings aren't that creative but they are filmed really nice. This is another thing i enjoyed from the film Sallys chase scene her screaming and the chainsaw really scared me like a lot. This film is also an inspiration to many horror films and i actually can see why. The way leatherface is portrayed is kind of sad he is an abused misunderstood being. I recommend this film to everyone 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You cannot argue about the impact this movie had on the horror landscape. You can argue about how you feel about it and if you like the movies it spawned (be it sequels or remakes or rip-offs). You can wonder why Tobe Hooper never really made anything big after that (Poltergeist being referenced as a Spielberg movie, though officially Mr. 'berg only produced it).Or you can just sit back and let the terror begin. This being filmed on the same location as his previous film (Eggshells, an experimental feature, that seemed to just exist for Tobe to try things out and then use them to make TCM), is extremely well shot (for the documentary feeling it aims for).Very quick and with some very strange characters and with some odd (acting) choices, this still has quite a bit going for it. Even if you feel it hasn't dated very good, it has dated better than a few other films. Still nowhere near anything Romero and others did (in my humble opinion), but definitely something that you should watch at least once!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly disturbing classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally re-watched this gem today and what a disturbing piece of rock it is. This is truly a classic within cinema, and a testimony to why these old low-budget horror-flicks beats any of the Hollywood-horror movies of today.the story itself is not so amazing. five young friends go for a summer-drive that lands them in hells-ville. and of course like any horror movie it plays on your imagination and fears and prejudice, in this case, inbred, demented, small Texas towns. this is not what makes it great. what makes it great, and a movie that is still scary and very very disturbing, is that the director understood that the less you see, the more is left to the imagination. This means that there is very little gore in the movie, and instead some very effective camera work and truly bizarre occurrences. its like a long nightmare.the acting is of course, below average, although compared to todays teenage slashers, it's great. the only actor that really stands out is Gunnar Hansen, who plays Leatherface, who gives so much life to an unforgettable character in the history of horror cinema.this movie is not for everyone though. if you are into Hollywood, CGI, and well, doesn't like horror-movies, don't watch this gem. But if you are among us geeks who enjoy Deadbeat 'till Dawn, Combat Shock, respect the original Halloween for what it is and thinks that Night of the Living Dead is still a good movie, you will be able to watch this again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An uncompromising horror classic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror has gone through stages, 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' marks the transition into the modern age of horror. 'Texas Chainsaw; was darker, scarier, and grittier than anything seen before it. It is a classic that is still effective and capable of scaring people after nearly forty years. Why? Tobe Hooper realized the true nature of fear. Horror films often are merely freak shows full of grotesques. 'Texas Chainsaw' takes a group of people and drags them ever closer to a place they would never want to go to. Hooper doesn't think his audience is stupid. Suspense is key.'Texas Chainsaw' feels real. It has sensationalist tendencies but there are pieces when we almost ignore them. The film looks like somebody brought out a home video camera and shot away. The feel of the film is blunt, to the point, and in many ways brilliant. Much is made of the documentary style filmmaking and it really is the highlight of the film. In someways it isn't what Hooper adds to his film but rather the horror clichés he omits. There isn't an overbearing soundtrack telling us how to feel. Our first introduction to the psychopath Leatherface is so abrupt we barely have time to collect our senses. It doesn't go for cheap jumpy scares. It heightens the tension but also strengthens our bound with the characters. I for one felt I was brought with into the Sawyer household and snuck into the rooms with our characters. It isn't because these characters are really all that well written, besides for Sally and Franklin, none of them have any sort of personality. The reason we care for them is because the distance is lessened. Real empathy is generated when we view these characters as human beings and not stereotypes. There isn't a glaring horror soundtrack or a character archetype spouting clichés. We forget we are in a horror film. The grimness of the situation speaks for it's self. The bones, the hideous man child, and the cannibalism need no more accenting lest they become over the top.People seem to forget that Chainsaw is a well acted picture too. Jim Siedow, Gunner Hansen, and Ed O'Neil all create fully fleshed out villains. We've seen various characters like Leatherface in countless horror films but Hansen adds depth to it. He isn't merely a mute with a chainsaw. Acting mute doesn't mean throwing a performance away. Hansen' performance is fully dimensional despite us never seeing his face. There is a brilliant scene in the film which really highlights both Hansen and Hooper's work. It is the first scene where we get to get a really close look at Leatherface, his face is accented by the dim sunlight coming through the slits of the shudders. Horror doesn't advertise that it's horror, we take a good look at Leatherface the only sound being his childlike groans. Leatherface looks somewhat pathetic in this scene, sad and unaware of the evil he is doing. That is really the strength of all the actors of the Sawyer family. In a twisted way they don't believe what they are doing is wrong. In someways the absurdness of the scenes where Siedow gathers his family for a meal both give us a break from the terror while intensifying it at the same time. We find ourselves with a little smirk but we soon realize the horror behind it. The Swayer family gives brilliant performances which bring out the best of the script.All in all 'Texas Chainsaw' is a well shot and well acted film which won't be forgotten any time soon. It's a blueprint every horror film actor should look at.</fullReview>

Once abattoir workers, the decay of the Southern rural economy has left them unemployed, and the direction less father and sons take to using their butchering skills on passing people. One by one, the kids encounter members of the grisly family. I did enjoy this movie and it did make me jump a few times. it was not as gory or bloody as the remake. it still had the same impact as the remake even without the blood and gore.The one thing that really got mad was that guy in the wheelchair is one got to one of most annoying people on this earth, i just could not stand him.I did enjoy the hitchhiker part which was really good but I do prefer the remake scene as it was shocking and Leather Face was really scary in the movie, did make me jump in one scene also there were few creepy moment around dinner table.The remake did have spine -chlling ending but this ending was really good to, as it show how mad you can get after being in such a really bad nightmare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What weird family dinner.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This time I'll start with the warnings. This movie is R-rated for a reason. I mean the title alone should give you a hint that this is a scary movie. in my opinion ghosts and monsters aren't scary because they're obviously not real. But the moment a movie show something terrifying that could be real, it's scary.Even though this is a more graphic film, the influences from Psycho and Night of the Living Dead are visible. I believe this movie qualifies as a slasher film.Another thing that makes this such a scary film is it's visuals. The movies low budget makes it looks eerily real. it has an almost documentary feel to it, and therefore are more believable. Also was was surprised to find that the skeleton ornaments in the film, was real. Apparently Tobe Hooper couldn't afford fake skeletons, but found an Indian company that sold real ones for a low price. This definitely freaked me out while watching it.Tobe Hooper definitely made film history with The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and he started a phenomenon. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre along with, Psycho, Night of the Living Dead, Jaws and Halloween made horror films what it is today. A genre that before had been frowned upon and never really explored, was taken to the next level with The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. And since horror has been a widely accepted genre.So any films have been inspired by The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, heck even a guy at my age who makes amateur movies made a scarily good and similar film to this. Another film which is like an urban version of this is; American Psycho, a film which I also recommend.This movie also set the standards for low-budget films a lot higher. the fact that this brilliant horror masterpiece came out of so little, is all thanks to Tobe Hooper. Many great director took inspiration from Hooper and made some really scary and cheap horror films. Take The Evil Dead (1981) 10 film students, $375,000 and still a great film. The budget for The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was only $140,000.I give this movie a 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic horror film....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Thought that the Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a fantastic film. The year is 1974. A group of five close friends are heading through the back roads of Texas on the way to their grandfather's vandalised grave. Among them are Sally Hardesty, and her brother Franklin. They encounter an hitchhiker (Neal) who slashes both himself &amp; Franklin with a wicked-looking knife. The others manage to get the hitchhiker out from the vehicle, but shortly afterwards, they are forced to stop &amp; wander over to a small, sinister looking house nearby in hopes for gas. What none of them realise is that this house is the home of Leatherface and his evil, demented family of cannibalistic psychopaths. One at a time, the teens are murdered by the evil Leatherface in horrifying ways. I thought that this was a great film in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was one really effective horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, after 27 years of curiosity of this controversial cult classic horror movie, I finally saw The Texas Chain Saw Massacre on YouTube which uploaded it a couple of weeks ago. When I first read about this in the Baton Rouge Morning Advocate in 1981 when the movie was re-released, the paper's critic at the time, David Foil, called it "awful" and gave a zero rating. I also read in Danny Peary's "Cult Movies" book that, compared to Wes Craven's Last House on the Left (which I have yet to see) which to him encouraged the audience to cheer for the killings, we're shocked at them here. No kidding! I especially felt sorry for the wheelchair-impaired Franklin especially when his sister Sally treated him badly before his fate. Sally though, as played by Marilyn Burns, does get the sympathy since she suffers the most especially when director Tobe Hooper cuts to extreme close-up on each of her eyes as she screams constantly dreading what Leatherface and his family are going to do to her. Not sure if I want to say this is a great horror movie but it's certainly one of the most effective ever. In fact, I'm not sure if I could have handled this film when I first read about it at age 13... P.S. Being a Louisiana resident, I'd like to acknowledge that the narrator was New Orleans native John Larroquette.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The one and only classic, loosely based on the life of Ed Gein who used to scalp his victims. Five young friends visiting an old house owned by one of their grandparents, are terrorized by a depraved Texas family. The gritty look and feel of the film is unmatched and the total lack of a blaring Hollywood score only adds to its effect. Horror films in my opinion work best when there's some subtly. The twisted Texas clan are a total riot to watch in the later scenes of the movie. Marilyn Burns, who plays the lead, takes fear and terror to a new level. The look in her eyes while being manipulated is something you can't fake. She clearly tapped into something real for her character. Things got so crazy during the famous dinner scene that Gunner Hanson, who played leatherface, really cut Marilyn's finger with a knife when fake blood wouldn't come out of the tube behind the blade. It was over 100 degrees and there really was rotting meat on the dinner table. Actors would do a take, go throw up, and go back to work. Edwin Neal who played the hitch-hiker stated "Filming that scene was the worst time of my life... and I had been in Vietnam, with people trying to kill me, so I guess that shows how bad it was." Good Stuff!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tobe Hooper's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has practically no bloodshed in it at all but yet it scared me more than most other horror movies that are filled with buckets of blood and gore. The idea is to let you watch a 'gruesome' scene, cut the death scene short or shoot it at an innocent angle and let the viewers brain figure out the rest, that my friends is the way to make a horror movie. I could imagine the crowds watching this in 1974, this type of a movie coming into theaters was unheard of at the time. The scariest part is that it is 100% believable the whole way through, the story of a group of teenagers traveling through Texas when a hitch-hiker joins the crowd and really starts to creep people out, the group eventually kicks him out and they descend to a desolate house/farm and find out one by one that they all are prey to a psychotic killer never before fathomed by any one person alive, that person was Leatherface (played to a 'T' by Gunnar Hansen) Tobe Hooper I give you a perfect rating for a great film.

		<shortDescription>What's the buzz about? I say it's the imagery.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TCM is a gloomy, grainy, dark and macabre piece of work. What happens in it is brutal and disturbing enough. But what makes it more disruptive to your sanity is how it's presented. The actors completely let go, mainly the villains, of their social mores and submit to the most deranged and subversive human nature. The imagery and sounds are so nerve-racking that those elements alone are enough to distress you. But it's horridly beautiful and mysterious, because there is no reason for all this to happen other than it's just a freak circumstance and bad fate. We have numerous images that flash before your eyes that set the tone and precurse the horror that follows: The cows in the stables feeding in slow motion and the ominous music background. there's the image of the sun up-close where we can actually see it's flames. We have flashes from a camera taken snapshots of body parts, human fragments, quickly, where you aren't exactly sure what you just saw, but can gather later. And the setting of the slaughterhouse where it is implied that some backward weirdos live in; pots and kitchen utensils strung and hang on tree branches. Sound weird? It looks weird. Then we see a horde of daddy long legged spiders nesting along the wall of a room. Creepy and grotesque it is. There is so much more. But the most brazenly disturbing imagery of all is where the young woman falls into that room loaded with human bones and remains which serve as decor for this house of soulless cretins. It all looks so real, you can only imagine it really happening. The scenes of terror are not subtle and are played with full-throttle fright and screaming. This was absolutely correct. For as we witness terror from another person it can only enhance and promulgate our own. This is not really a celebration of terror and human cruelty. It appears to me as simply a case where man has degenerated hopelessly. So hopeless that they do not even know or comprehend the impact and turpitude of their acts. It's without reason and logic and just unfolds before our eyes. And yet it looks so believable and real.</fullReview>

The film is about a bunch of kids who have no brains so they trespass onto someone elses property. Were they expecting the owners to be pleased? One of the stand out scenes is where a girl is hung on a meathook. Though its not graphic the idea is still rather unpleseant. However there is no reason to flinch because its so hammy. Seeing as you would stay away from Leatherfaces smelly house you should stay away from the DVD as it carries the same unpleseant oders.</fullReview>

The movie builds, revealing the depravity of the family, until you see the creepy grandfather, who I swore was dead, start sucking vigorously on the girl's finger. Say what you want, that is the creepiest moment in the film. It also has a killer ending with Leatherface heaving his chainsaw around his head while lamenting the loss of his family's new couch ornament. This trumps the 2003 travesty by keeping the shocks simple and the gore limited. The image of one of the girls writhing on a hook beats anything in the glitzy remake.</fullReview>

When they stop at the old place at one of their friends. They find themselves stalked and killed by a crazed family of cannibals (Edwin Neal, Jim Siedow, Ginnar Hansen &amp; John Dugan). While some of them fight to live this horrific nightmare.Directed by Tobe Hooper (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, The Funhouse, Poltergeist) made a horrific, realistic, scary horror film. Which is based on a story by director:Hooper and screenwriter:Kim Henkel (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 4:The Next Generation, Eaten Alive, Last Night at the Alamo). Hooper and Henkel also wrote the screenplay. Which is based on some facts on the late murderer by the name of Ed Gein. Which movies are also based on this murderer like "Psycho", "Deranged", "The Silence of the Lambs" and even a picture titled "Ed Gein".The original DVD from Pionner, DVD has an OK non-anamorphic Widescreen (1.75:1) transfer and an fine Dolby 2.0 Surround Sound. DVD has an entertaining commentary track by the director, cinematographer:Daniel Pearl (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre "2003", Alien Vs Predator 2, Pathfinder) and actor:Hansen (Who played the infamous "Leatheface"). DVD also includes Deleted Scenes, Outtakes and more.The latest two disc set from Dark Sky Films has an stunning new digital transfer and an strong new Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD features the same commentary track from the previous DVD but also has an new commentary track moderated by David Gregory, Marilyn Burns, The late Paul A. Partain, Allen Danziger and the late art director/production designer:Robert A. Burns (The Hills Have Eyes, The Howling, Re-Animator). DVD includes the same features from the previous DVD and it also includes new features like two documentary with the cast and crew and more. This film was an instant cult hit at the box office. Even bigger cult success, when it was released on video. This disturbing darkly funny realistic horror film is not for everyone taste. One of the best horror films ever made. An near masterpiece. Director Hooper never tops this picture ever since. (**** 1/2 out of *****).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" is a film that I didn't initially warm to. When I first viewed the film, some 20 years ago, I found the experience anti-climatic and over-hyped. Having since seen the film on the big screen (with an accompanying talk from Kim Henkel) and re-mastered DVD (thanks to Dark Skies), I've grown to appreciate "Texas Chain Saw" for the classic it is.Tobe Hooper's opening to the movie is powerful stuff. The flash-bulbs of a camera illuminating the hellish scenes of decomposing bodies, accompanied by a wicked soundtrack, ranks amongst the best beginnings of any horror movie I've seen.The film has great atmosphere, realistic performances, and a genuine "roller-coaster" feel. While later films such as "Wolf Creek" are arguably more effective, "Texas Chain Saw" set the stall out for its successors.The raw energy of the performers is electrifying. Marilyn Burns' performance of the victim frightened to the edge of insanity is simply brilliant. Gunnar Hansen's lumbering, grunting Leatherface is one of the most frightening screen maniacs. There's nothing supernatural or super-human about his character. He's just a very disturbed individual who's very handy with a mallet or chainsaw! A genuine classic that has matured like a fine vintage, "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" is a superb example of low-budget film-making delivering believable and effective results.</fullReview>

This is the be-all and end-all of horror movies and it's one of those rare movies where the sequel was actually just as good as the original (in some ways it was even better). Avoid the subsequent sequels (after part 2 it went downhill)as well as the recent remake and the prequel unless you have already seen the original because it's really 2 totally different stories. As a horror fan of many, many years there are only a select few horror films that have actually scared the crap out of me and this is one of them!

		<fullReview>It's August 1973 in the Lone Star State of Texas, there's been reports of a massacre on people getting killed and graves being dug up. A group of 5 teenagers were traveling to visit Franklin's(who is the terminal guy of the group) Uncle's place.They were in need for gas for their car. Because the local Gas Station's tanks are empty and won't get refilled till sometime later.When they made it there, 4 of them checked out the place for themselves, while Franklin is left to push himself on his wheelchair. He wasn't enjoying himself because his friends are able to walk while he's left helpless.As the "moble" friends explored the acres of the land, they found a house in the distance. But little did they knew was that it's modeled and lived by a murder that kills anything that comes into his own house.This movie is a classic, for an independent and non-Hollywood made movie. It's well thought up for a 32 Day production movie. Even though it's not as gory as the recent overrated movies. Texas Chain Saw Masacre proves that great flicks don't need gore to be successful.That and Leatherface is a great portrayal of a murder. Both sub-human and a killing machine. So those who like classically made movies like original "Halloween" will like this movie. Any old school horror critic can tell you that this is among one of the best in Horror related films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre ****If you compare modern day horror films to the original Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Saw, Saw II, Hostel, Wolf Creek, Slither, and among others just look like Disney films. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is the real deal. The actors actually look terrified and they don't secretly look at the camera and wink. What makes this movie realistic? Well first of all the movie isn't really based on a true story, it's just a tag line however it is based on a serial killer who killed his victims practically the same way, but let's face it, your more likely to come across a cannibalistic family then being drugged and put in a death puzzle, unless it's Leatherface himself. But how is this movie different then any other modern day horror film? It doesn't use special effects to scare somebody plus they don't relay on torturing. Modern day horror filmmakers really need to study this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best ever in horror history, period.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE is quite simply one of the BEST ever in the history of horror. Sure it's a little dated (it was made in 1974 and shot on 16mm film), but it's got the heart of a lion. The reason this film is considered an absolute classic is because regardless of the story not being 100% true, it FEELS so real. It's VERY believable that something like that can actually happen in real life. The fact that it's virtually bloodless/goreless, contradictory to what so many people have claimed over the years, shows just how much of an effect it has on the viewer. Also, notice there is NO musical score in the entire movie. Just odd sounds, screaming and a chainsaw buzzing, which only helps to create a terrifying atmosphere that seems so real. All of this and more is the reason why the slickly produced soul-less Hollywood remake can't touch the original. THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE belongs in EVERY horror fans collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ah the buzzing of a chainsaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feared the hype going into this film may have disappointed me but it didn't. The atmosphere, the tension, paralleled only by other horror classics like Alien and Halloween. The simplistic plot and characters are easily overlooked for the unrelenting and merciless tension. This film feels so real. Unlike Jason and Freddy, Leatherface is real. He's the guy you see at mental institutions, he's Ed Gein, John Wayne Gacy, etc.The way he murders and captures people is realistic. He won't just suddenly appear from the corner after falling miles behind. Describing the effect this film had on me is very difficult. This one has to be seen to be believed. Even now I still have the shivers from watching this. Very few films have ever effected me in this way, if any at all. This film is not like Halloween. This film disturbs, and does it in some ways subtle, not to say you have to pay extra close attention, it's just that you won't notice likely at first. On the downside the girl's screaming CAN get a tad annoying and if it fails to scare you then you probably won't find it paticuarly entertaining.Trust me though, you should definitely give this one a chance at least.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How brilliant is this film? it is basically the epitome of all horror movies because it builds suspense and atmosphere in which most horror movies could think of.Add this to a genuine and believable serial killer like Leatherface (and his Macabre and malevolent family) and a camper van full of teenagers then you should have a decent serial killer Flick. Most modern films rely too much on Blood and gore and a motive(WHY IS THIS?) for a serial killer too have. But in my opinion a decent weapon for a serial killer(Chainsaw was probably the one I ad to look away from when watching this film) and a motiveless serial killer then I believe that makes a genuine scary movie that will live on and on</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It starts off slow, but when it happens you'll know." Those were more or less the words that a friend of mine once told me as warning about The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. My first exposure to this movie was watching it alone at night and being utterly disturbed by it. A lot of times a horror movie will come along and people will say that it scared them as a kid. This movie scared me when I was eighteen. The first night I watched it, I could hardly sleep. It was and is quite unlike other horror films in that it has a very realistic almost documentary style to it.Now I consider myself to be somewhat of a horror movie buff. Before I had seen Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I had seen all the classics. Friday The 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Evil Dead. Other horror movies I had seen were not necessarily scary in the lose sleep sense, they were scary in the intense feeling in the pit of your stomach sense.You may be asking, if the movie bothered you so much why such a high rating? Well, quite simply it set out to shock and disturb and it succeeded brilliantly. Comedies are suppose to make you laugh, sad movies are suppose to make you cry and horror movies are suppose to scare you. Texas Chainsaw Massacre did what it was suppose to do therefore it receives the rating it's getting.On final note. Last year I saw this movie at midnight screening. Skeptical that todays audiences wouldn't be affected by a thirty horror movie I prepared for the worst. People were literally jumping out of their chairs and screaming in terror. It's a testament to the films power.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When it comes to talking about horror films, this is towards the top of the list of most important and the best of all time. There's something that can be said for realistic, almost feasible horror occurring to regular people. This one hits it out of the park! It's hardly the gore fest that many consider it to be when they avoid it based on the title, or as they recall it from years back. What occurs during this flick is mostly up to the audience member. So much is alluded to, the set design is so top notch, and the shooting style is so raw that one feels they are seeing far more on-screen blood and guts. It's great film-making! This is the psychological horror movie Hitchcock was trying to make when he made "Frenzy" two years earlier, as he too went back to "Psycho" for inspiration. This is a truly great work of cinematic entertainment.That's not all, however. Interweaved within all of the gruesome nature is a deeper meaning that speaks about the generation this film was born during, and it offers up suggestions as to why filmmakers continue to go back to the horror genre after all of these years. Truthfully, I believe it can be to say something about the human condition.</fullReview>

I think Tobe Hooper did a fantastic job on this what people might this movie a classic. From sledgehammers, meat-hooks, to chainsaws, this is a must have for every horror movie buff out there today. Although it might be old, it is definitely a movie worth watching and buying. the plot is where five teens go on a road trip and end up with no gas and get killed by the murderous clutches of Leatherface (Hansen). In the mean time, Sally Hardesty (Burns) runs for dear life and ends up living in the end. It's just a movie you have to watch to get it!!! Dare you to watch it at Midnight!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is absolutely the freakiest movie ever !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love horror movies, but mostly they are just funny. You know, tonnes of zombies and body-parts all over the place. Mostly '80s horrors are like that. Except for my other favorite; Poltergeist, but that's more a beautiful movie, rather than a scary one. But this movie is so different, also because it's from the '70s, but most of all because the scary thing is not what you see, it's what you don't see. That makes it freaky. The atmosphere is so creepy, also because these are normal teen-agers, these could be you and me. Also the music/sounds in the movie gives you goose bums. The most frustrating scene is when the freaky family has the girl at the dinner table and the grandfather (he must be at least 165 years old!) tries to smash her head in with a hammer. Also the scene when she escapes and finally finds a police station and thinks she is save, it appeared that the police man is also one of them and brings her back to the chainsaw family. All in all the best horror ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>South Trail Drive In</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw The Texas Chainsaw Massacre at the South Trail Drive In when I was ten years old. I used to go there all of the time with my Uncle Dave. We would go almost every weekend. As I had a pretty unhappy home life, these excursions were holy to me. My uncle had a 1972 Plymouth Satellite with bucket seats and a forest green metallic paint job. I don't remember what kind of engine it was, but it had a lot of power and roared when you punched it. The soundtrack was always The Doors, Black Sabbath, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, and Pink Floyd.It was the most psychotic thing I had ever seen. I had already seen a lot of horror movies at that tender age, but I had never seen anything that relentless. It gave me nightmares later....and that's how I discovered the power of cinema.The South Trail no longer exists. It closed in 1984 and was turned into a car lot. It lives now only in my memories...where it will always be my church."If you do not strive with others, you will be free from blame."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror at its most horrific</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first: this is not a true story. There was no cannibalistic serial-killer family in the 1970's Texas, this movie was loosely based on the exploits of Wisconsin murderer Ed Gein and the rest is fantasy.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was released in October of 1974, and was an immediate success. All across the nation, people were running out of the theater in shock of what they were seeing. The film cost $100,000 to make, and wound up grossing about $30 million. In other words, 300 times its budget. Not bad for an indie horror flick.Over the years, TCM has garnered a reputation as being extremely gory, perverted, and being a symbol of everything that is wrong in America. The film has been banned in many countries due to its content, and is equally reviled as it is praised.It was with some hesitation that I sat down to watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I had avoided it due entirely to its reputation. But what happened as I was watching it was interesting. For the first time since seeing The Exorcist 4 years earlier, I was completely terrified by a movie. On the edge of my seat, squirming, heart racingly TERRIFIED.To start off, there is hardly any blood at all in the movie. Yes, people get butchered by Leatherface, and there is the girl on the meathook, but its all done with sound effects and imaginative camera angles. There's literally only about 2 ounces of blood seen in the entire movie. Secondly, you don't even really see what's happening when the people are slaughtered. Your imagination is forced to take over, which is even scarier than all the blood and guts in the world.Is the movie any good? Yes! The reason I praise The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is its unparallelled ability to horrify the viewer. This film comes as close to a living nightmare as any film could possibly come. This film is absolutely ruthless in its attempt to drive you right out of your mind. The infamous dinner scene is one such example. For 10 solid minutes there's nothing but yelling and screaming and all-out craziness going on. The fantastic camera angles and Marilyn Burns' terrifying screaming is enough to drive anyone mad. You are pulled into whats happening on screen, and you are not even given a second to breathe.Marilyn Burns is extraordinary as the film's heroine. As you watch the movie, you cannot even tell she is acting. Also, she is one hell of a screamer! During the dinner scene, you can tell that she is truly terrified, and cannot believe what is happening around her. You feel for her, and cannot believe what is happening to her, which makes the film even more horrifying. Gunnar Hansen is also fantastic as Leatherface. He adds a human quality to this cannibalistic monster that makes the movie even more unsettling.Tobe Hooper's direction is first rate. He decided to shoot the movie like a documentary which makes the film even more horrifying. You think what is happening on screen is actually happening to the people right at that very moment. The graininess of the picture adds even more to the feel of the film.Simply put, this is one of the most horrifying films I have ever seen. Everything is first rate, and I highly suggest that anyone who has an appreciation for true horror see it. It ranks right up there with The Exorcist as one of the scariest films of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few horror movies even come close to 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,' and it simply may be the greatest horror movie ever made. Back in the year this movie was released, people were shocked, outraged, and found the flick to be a disgusting piece of work, not realizing the pure genius it was. Drawing its story from the infamous Ed Gein, 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' is one of the most gruesome, terrifying, and famous horror movies ever made. The film manages to creep you out with its straight-forward no-flash presentation, giving you more of a feel of a reality based product, and the just right acting by the majority of the cast. The creepy, middle of no where setting really makes the movie, and gives you a feeling that our victims really never are going to escape. The family members, and numerous characters the gang meets along the way, along with their dialogue, really give you a creepy feeling, especially the cemetery scene. From the moment The Hitchhiker enters the gang's van, the film never slows down, and keeps the scares and chills coming at you in every way imaginable. From the slight comedy relief from the Old Man, to the frightening Leatherface chase scenes throw the woods, including the infamous hook-hanging scene, to the flat-out creepy aged "zombie-like" Grandpa, 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' is bound to scare you at one point, no matter what age, or who you are.To put it simply, 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' was a movie far ahead of its time, and should be viewed by everyone: horror fan or not. Just make sure you view the flick on an empty stomach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Disturbing Movie You'll Ever See.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has to be the all-time most disturbing movie to ever hit our screen. 5 Teenage friends are travelling across the countryside and stumble upon a hitchhiker who is deranged and everyone expects that he is part of Leatherface's family. Later on they find a house. A house with wallpaper made of skin, a room with chicken feathers/bones/live chickens. And the infamous torture room featuring 2 hooks. 1 by 1 they are picked off, leaving poor Sally running for her life from the chainsaw wielding Leatherface. She then finds herself tied to a chair and forced to have dinner with the family and there Grampa. The grampa probably is the scariest element of the movie seeing as he looks like he is over 100 years old and likes to suck blood off of innocent girl's fingers. The sole survivor then legs it for survival.The showdown is one of the moments where you begins screaming at your television: "RUN!!!!!" "He's gonna getcha!!!". A trucker stops of and throws a wrench to leatherface's head, (whatever happened to that trucker guy anyways?)then another pedestrian picks her up in his pick up truck and that leaves Leatherface stranded in the middle of the road with his chainsaw going up and down up and down then END. All too quickly. I didn't feel 100% healthy after watching this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>truly, truly, deeply frightening...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So much has been said about this film in various literary forms that a simple review no longer seems appropriate in this day and age. Suffice it to say this is not only the best horror movie ever made but to be honest it could easily be argued that it is the best MOVIE ever made full stop. No horror movie before or since has captured the same intensity of raw, repellent and unrelenting fear.Whether it be a happy accident due to the tiny budget or a clear stylistic choice from the outset, the stark, eye-watering realism of the film reels you in like a fish on the end of a rusty barb and then it mercilessly toys with, and destroys you like a child pissing on a nest of ants. This primal fear that the film evokes is made all the more lasting by the notion that whilst you are nestled up warm on your sofa watching the movie in the comfort of your home, somewhere in this sick world that we live in, someone could very well be in the process of doing precisely the things that 'Leatherface and family' are doing to those poor kids. Does no one find that deeply frightening? I sure do!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sally, along with her brother and some friends, go to a graveyard that has been ransacked to see if the remains of their grandfather are still there and in one piece. They also decide to visit their old family home in the Texan countryside. After they do a bit of exploring they discover that there are some seriously demented people living nearby and their vacation quickly descends into a nightmare.Like many camp horror films that followed it, this film is pretty simple in terms of story and the film's undisputed strength comes in the atmosphere and the sense of danger. Added to that is the fact that many key fright scenes take place during the day, yet the gruesome sense of terror is more than present, it unrelenting. Pounding away beneath the surface. In addition to using natural light the film makes a large use of natural sound - piercing screams and that chainsaw! Many of the films murders have none of that sudden jolt of music that many other horror films ridiculously over use.Also some clever cinematography adds a punch. Especially during the dinner scene. Tobe Hooper cruises a fine line of what to show and what to leave to the imagination and he keeps that balance shockingly well throughout. Certain things you hear but don't see; some you see but without and non diagetic sound accompaniment; some you see but from an obscured angle; some you see in their entirety but for only a second. This really forces the viewer to imagine the a lot of terror and by the time the film is over it'll stick with you. And this is not a horror film easily forgotten. 8/10Rated R: horror violence and gruesome images</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The greatest horror movie of all time is John Carpenters masterpiece "Halloween", however, this is not far behind. Quite possibly the most verbally creepy movie of all time. The Hitchhiker talking about how to make "Headcheese", good God Almighty, sikkkkkkkkk. The very first appearance of Leatherface scared the living crap out of me. He was pretty damn deadly with that sledgehammer. His true origins kept me in mystery as well, I kept wondering if the Hitchhiker and leatherface were the same person, or if the old gas station man was him. The I find its a whole FAMILY of pshycos, WOW! Hooper kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through with masterful directing. The acting is topnotch, although the characters did not really develop, it really didn't matter considering how quick leatherface killed them off. The only ones who we needed to care about were Sally, Franklin, Leatherface Hitchhiker, and Father phsyco. The father got to me as someone who killed solely for food, he talked about how he just cant stomach killin. Hitchhiker was just....well, i'm not really sure. Leatherface was just plain CREEPY. LOVE to see him and Michael Myers duke it out. All in all, This is the second greatest movie ever made and it is certainly a classic. The remake is decent, though its more of TCM 5 than a remake of the original. But if you see this one, pick it up, it'll be well worth your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was at (an all-boys) school in the 1980s, 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' was the film that everyone had to claim to have seen to prove they were hard, quite a feat given that the movie was already ten years old. But it was undoubtedly years ahead of its time. With its naturalistic, off-focus story telling, the absence of a score (the chainsaw provides its own grim music), its hapless teenage protagonists, and with the way (for the first half of the film) that everything is conveyed by suggestion, not what we actually see, it could be as modern as 'The Blair Witch Project' were it not for the very 70s clothing and hairstyles. On the downside, the acting is poor and the plot simplistic to the point of junenivility (for this movie, it surely doesn't really count as a spoiler to say that is basically involves a bunch of psychopaths cutting people up). Yet when the film shifts gear and transforms itself into more of a "conventional" horror movie, it does so with such conviction, and such utter repulsiveness, that it still stands out almost unparallelled. Although the whole experience has clearly been contrived to shock, it still succeeds in doing so, a deliberate piece of nastiness that slices through the viewer as the eponymous chain saw slices through its victims. I'm glad that all films aren't like this one; yet in it's own way, it stands as one of many landmark films from American cinema's glory years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps one of the most famous drive-in shockers was Director Tobe Hooper's 1974 THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE, now available on a Pioneer Special Edition DVD, complete with out-takes, pieces off the workprint, and an excellent audio commentary track by Hooper, his cinematographer, Daniel Pearl and star Gunnar Hansen. The gore is more implied than displayed, but it's CHAINSAW's unforgiving documentary style that grabs you and disturbs your dreams. Check out the neat Special Features on this incredible DVD. The out-takes have a raw look, the color is not yet timed, and all we get is the bare, hollow sound typical of un-mixed production sound. We see endless takes of human bone decoration that highlights the crazy cannibal house in CHAINSAW. There are many takes of the macabre cemetery bone statue, the image that opens CHAINSAW. The audio commentary tells us that Hooper and Pearl experimented by shooting the scene during different times during the day, to obtain different sunlit shooting schemes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tobe Hooper is a strange kind of director, and many would claim not a very good one. He has made a lot of complete flops throughout his career, which makes it all the more surprising that his first feature film is so damn good. To me "Texas Chainsaw" is a true work of art, the savage beauty of this movie is incredible. The deaths come in some very stylish shots: instead of the standard killer comes closer-violin music routine, we see the murders from a random shot, plain, which make them even more brutal. It's just a bunch of stuff happening and suddenly hey, murder. The cinematography is fit for postcards, Texas has never looked greater. One of the best horror movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror films ever filmed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's very few I could add to the many comments about this masterpiece. The documentary-look, the great acting, the original way to tell a story, even the effective marketing(the based on a true story); everything is classic. No wonder why it is considered among the best horror films ever done.Most of the film's scare factor is in the fact that Leatherface &amp; his family are NOT superhuman, unlike other slasher-movies, there was nothing supernatural about them. They were just bizarre psychos whose only interest was to kill whoever they meet.The story is the classic slasher movie. A group of friends goes to the rural areas of the U.S. only to find a group of killers in an old house. What makes this movie different, is the way it handles the suspense for the most part of the movie. They pick up a hitchhiker and the whole scene turns so scary it's almost impossible to stop looking the screen, it's a superb way to handle suspense that one can only wonder why director Tobe Hooper's career never was a big one.Gunnar Hansen's portrayal of Leatherface is remarkable in the fact that he gives lots of humanity to his character. He is not a mindless killer, he has the emotions of a human being, but so distorted and twisted that he is truly scary. It's so real that it makes you wonder if truly there are people like those depicted in film.The rest of the cast does a good job in this low-budget film, you really feel for the victims, as one by one is killed by Leatherface. There is not really ultra violence here, but the movie doesn't need those gimmicks to be disturbing. The way it looks, they it feels, that's enough to give a powerful impression in the viewer.Maybe dated by now, but always remembered as a classic. Tobe Hooper's Texas Chain Saw Massacre will always be considered a landmark in the horror genre.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much maligned movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the modus operandi of the principal villain in this tale is novel, the story itself is hackneyed and unconvincing. If you're looking for plot, character development and production values, you've come to the wrong place.You can appreciate this film as an experiment in film-making. Interesting photographic techniques, the unconventional use of light and sound, bizarre make-up - it overwhelms the senses. Despite the grainy print (a positive feature that DVD fortunately can't diminish) and use of a bland savanna as a setting, it remains a truly visual experience. The dialogue is nothing to write home about, the acting is, well, intense to say the least, but the reputation ascribed to this film, goes far beyond anything actually depicted, and is totally unwarranted.This film heralded a new epoch in the horror genre, a prelude to the "slasher" sub-genre that would emerge in the late seventies. But take note, this is a cut above (no pun intended) the rest and shouldn't be blamed for the likes of William Lustig's "Maniac", or others of the ilk.If you watch - and subsequently enjoy - this movie, I'd recommend you try to catch "Deranged" (1974), which is loosely based on the same subject. Watching both films should give you a sense of the creators' perspective when developing the same material, and emphasise the importance of this film as an exponent of experimental film-making. As with "Chain Saw", the title "Deranged" begets a more gruesome image than the film actually conveys. When you're done, consider when is a hot dog not a hot dog ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Well made Horror Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** out of ****This is a film about how far people are willing to go to make money. At it's core, it seems like a disturbing and bleak horror film, but think hard about it and you'll find a concept that makes really good sense. At first glance, the film feels like a horror film, but deep down inside, this is a film about how far some people are willing to go to make money. The film is told in very obscure details. This film keeps the story in small detail and chocks it full of cannibalism, torture, gore, horror, and nonstop relentless violent action that shows young people thrown into a horrific battle with disturbed people and only the really lucky survive.The film opens with two very disgusting and badly mutilated bodies tied to a cross. These are two victims of some very messed up people that live nearby. These two bodies may belong to two of the five young people who are the innocent. One of them is in a wheelchair. Once I saw him I thought, "He won't get very far!" Whether he does or not, I won't reveal.The five young people make a stop to pick up a funny looking hitchhiker near a decrepit slaughterhouse. He talks funny too. A crazy, retarded, redneck, hillbilly, back house fighter. He is human, just like the five young people that picked him up, but they are scared by him as he poses weird fire rituals and snaps photos of the terrified people. When he starts being really violent, they throw him out of their van. He rubs blood on the van as it is driving away, showing that he wants them to be found by someone bad.They go to a gas station to fill up. The gas station owner has a barbecue stand out front where they make money with customers. After they get gas, they head out to a house that a couple of them grew up in. Two of them go swimming, find the lake dried up, and they go to ask for gas. What they get in return is not only bad, but also horrifying. Not even the worst of nightmares can prepare what is in store for them when not only a family is against them, it's all of Texas it seems! The film is filmed in a very grainy, low quality way that makes the film feel very very documentary and also feels like recovered footage in an archive somewhere. Old video cameras seem to have been used to make this instead of sound equipment, machinery, studio vehicles, scripts, or even professional actors.The film doesn't feel like a film. It feels like a police video or documentary. The acting is very realistic and not at all dramatic, comedic, or scary. It all just seems natural.The strong violence is not at all gratuitous or fake looking. It is relentlessly real and very disturbing. The gore is shown, but not in a way you will imagine. It is shown very realistically and with strong purpose.Do see this film, but prepare yourself for one of the most sick experiences of your life. From the shocking opening scene, to the just plain whacked out ending, this film will most likely horrify you. It is questionable whether it will gross you out though.Unofficial Film Rating Reason: Rated R for Demented Violent Content, Torture and Mayham, and for Terror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of young people travailing through Texas fall victim to a homicidal family.There are many things that combine to make Texas Chain Saw Massacre one of the best horror films of all time.First up,is the incredible use of sounds.Screeching chainsaws,animal grunting,the click of a camera,Marilyn Burns screaming,combined with the the completely simple score,sometimes consisting up of a single cymbal clash,serves up a sound experience.Couple that with Tobe Hooper's excellent directing.This film is a visual masterpiece,some of the shots are absolutely incredible.Things such as the travailing shot under the swing and the close up of Marilyn Burns eyes are shots not to be missed.The film has a very gritty documentary feel to it,making all the nasty happenings more nasty.There are many classic scenes,such as the completely sick "bone room" and the superb Sally Hardesty stalk scene.The cinematography by Daniel Pearl is also impressive,some very well set up shots and lots of creepy atmosphere.But I think the most effective thing in the scare factor is the acting.How,people call this bad is beyond me.This is some of the most harrowing,realistic,and disturbing acting to be found in a horror film. Marilyn Burns is absolutely incredible and gives an amazing performance as the fighting victem,while(the recently deceased) Paul A. Partin gives a very credible and hilarious performance as her brother. Edwin Neal gives a wild and eccentric performance,while Jim Siedow gives a more subtle performance,and Gunnar Hansen is incredible as the masked maniac Leatherface.Highly recommended,a horror must see 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely Disturbing Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Tobe Hooper, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the most disturbing and horrifying movies I have seen. It is also one of the movies that changed the way people looked at horror.The acting is considered poor but I think it is realistic, it's hard to see or hear at times due to the low budget but by god this movie is a terrific and terrifying experience.This movie is about a group of five people, Sally, her brother Franklin and her friends, Pam, Kirk and Jerry who travel to Texas to visit Sally's grandfather's grave and house. Little do they know next door to Sally's grandfather's house there is a family of cannibals. One in particular who is fond of the chainsaw.From here on they get killed one by one in very horrific ways.I can honestly say this is one of the scariest movies I have seen because it doesn't rely on cheap frights to scare the audience. Most of the kills happen in broad daylight and there is no blood, which makes it more terrifying. The supper scene towards the end is extremely claustrophobic in its feel. The ending leaves the audience with a sense of dread as it isn't the typical happy ending.I recommend it to any horror buff or lovers of hardcore horror.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE (1974)starring: Marilyn Burns, Paul A. Partain, Allen Danziger, William Vail, Teri McMinn, Gunnar Hansen, Edwin Neal, Jim Siedow.plot: After hearing reports of grave robbing, Sally (Marilyn Burns) travels to rural Texas with her invalid brother (Paul A. Partain) and three friends (Allen Danziger, William Vail, Teri McMinn) to check on a family grave. While there, they decide to spend the night in Sally and Franklin's Grandparent's old house. As the friends wander around the area, one-by-one they run into the murderous clutches Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) and his bizarre cannibalistic family.my thoughts: Tobe Hooper has directed this perfect, flawless horror film which to this day is still the most frightening slasher film I have ever seen. I'll start with the way it is directed. Hooper makes the film look very realist by having it look almost like a documentary. These is barely even a score but that works here.The events in this film are also very realistic and are loosely based on the Ed Gein killings that didn't take place too long before this. The fact that this could happen to anyone and anywhere is what makes it even more chilling and sets it above most other horror films, and it is just as frightening to put yourself in the character's shoes as they meet their demise or are chased, it is no wonder that when the film first opened audience members walked out in a state of shock!Some people complain that the teenagers who are the main characters are not fully developed characters, which is true. But what makes them interesting is that they are just as pretty as your average teenagers you see in everyday life and they act very natural, which made them likable enough. The actors really impressed me, especially Marilyn Burns who went through hell, both the character and the actress. I wouldn't be surprised if she had a big therapy bill after this film.Some people also complain about the lack of gore. There is some gore here, but it is mostly left to the imagination and what you think can be much more terrifying than what you see.Any horror fan who has not yet seen this classic should rush to buy it or rent it as quick as possible, unless they are too scared of course!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is disturbing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ATMOSPHERE is the real star of this film, the idea that a group of people can fall into such misfortune, right under the noses of the world at large, and it's just plain disturbing. I get mad at the sequels, because Gunnar Hansen's portrayal of Leatherface is genuinely frightening. He is nothing more than a killing machine, no personality, severely retarded, and only gibbers and squeals to speak. The sequels softened his "character." When you finally see the family together, they look like the Rogues Gallery from the old Dick Tracy comic strips, and Leather's brother , well, we've all seen this type, and we all avoid him. You just itch at the sight of him.(spoiler coming up) One of the hardest scenes to watch is when Leatherface drags Pam, hysterical, back to the kitchen, and just plops her on one of the meat-hooks. She gasps, chokes, and cries as her boyfriend, Kirk, is being dismembered on the table. The shot of a weather- vane outside, with distant screams, is gut-wrenching. The dining room scene, toward the end, is just SO unsettling, the muscles in the back of my neck need to be relaxed afterward. Forcing Sally's head down into a washtub, and letting the grandfather try to hit her with a sledge hammer, will fill you with such revulsion, you forget it's just a movie. They just don't make them like this anymore. But then, maybe they never did in the first place. Don't miss this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Movie will forever haunt me as long as i live. When I first rented this movie in 1985, I was disappointed in the plot and was even more upset with the dialog. When I watched it a year later, alone in the dark, my views had quickly changed at how much material I actually overlooked a year before. There is so much going on in the film that you do not realize until you have watched it again and again. The most disturbing and frightening things in this movie are the elements that are left unexplained and the setting is all too real and authentic. The murder scenes are genuine and the killer in the film was the first horror film icon to sport a mask during his reign of terror that has been mimicked by other horror icons such as Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees and other serial Killers. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is the Mother of all Horror Films. A Prelude to the horror exploitation that was just a few years away!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..people like my dad for instance, said this movie was scary.. I just thought it out to be odd..very odd..Its mainly about a "slow" dude who likes to eat people along with his ever so cute family. But i noticed, he hardly ever uses his chainsaw, so why didn't they just stick with the name "headcheese" its much more cool and retro for its time. But the movie honestly didn't scare me, It also was a complete throw off from the Ed Gein story's i have seen and heard. It was pretty crappy and merely scary and it wasn't as gruesome as its cracked up to be. And on the box case of the next TCM in the series, it says "More funny then the first!" I was unaware that the first was even a bit funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TCM is not an art film. It's not a character driven film with plausible acting and smart, long lines. It's merely 90 minutes of pure horror and style, and yeah... no blood. "?No blood?", you might say. "So, ?how is it scary then?". Terror is not about how much blood or intestines you put on screen. Peter Jackson's Braindead has a lot of blood and gore and it's a comedy. Terror is about atmosphere and what you know a living nightmare would be like. You could be kidnapped and get strapped in a chair and totally feel terrified, even when your captors won't hit you or cut you. This movie is pure style genius. The gritty look makes you feel this is actually real. Yeah, it has some make up problems, but you won't notice it because you'll be biting your nails in terror and desperation. The moment that meat hook appears on screen, get ready, you're set on your way to watch a classic scene of pure disgust? and ?no blood! That's how great TCM is!!!Watch it and then feel sorry for everything that came after. ?House of Wax (2005)? Hahahaha. Please don't make me laugh.Enjoy your meat.</fullReview>

Filled with poetic images of terror. And if you don't believe poetry can be terrifying try reading Harry Crosby. This film is something else entirely. It is a sonic meditation on the texture of evil.

		<shortDescription>Sheer carnage but only slightly disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Classic horror based on true story still manages to perversely entertain but there's perhaps not really an awful lot, strictly speaking, to derive from it at the end of the day. Certainly not any real morals.Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a surreal and apparently disturbing account of a true story which occurred in Texas. Frankly the facts behind the case are decidedly flimsy in terms of their base translation to the movie, but for the purposes of the review I'll focus on the movie as a production in its own right.A rather unknown cast takes up the helm as a group of teenagers on a road trip to visit one of their number's childhood house. They pick up a hitch-hiker on the way who scares them with his manic behaviour before they kick him off and eventually arrive at their destination.However, one by one, they explore another house in the vicinity and discover to their cost that the resident isn't the most welcoming of hosts...At its foundations, it's pretty basic stuff. Young kids see quiet dark house and go in without turning on the lights, before being suckered in and slaughtered by the psycho killer with their weapon of choice, in this case the implement of the movie title.However, dig a little deeper and there's a fairly decent core in here too, because while the surface seems to be pure slasher, the hidden layer reveals a level of twisted sickness at a true cerebral level. The disturbing nature of the crazed family at the centre of the killings is frankly highly imaginative, and just mad enough to almost be believable. Every one of them, while perhaps slightly parodial of crazed killers, are scary enough in what they represent. This enables them to really work effectively on-screen.By today's standards there's little genuinely fearful here, but the truly dark (Literally as well as thematically) visuals and atmosphere are enough to create an undercurrent of true despair and a genuinely hopeless surrealness permeates throughout.The violence is really non-existent, and there is a lack of blood, but that's not where this film was going. This movie smarts thanks to both; fantastic cinematography, which has some superbly ingenious camera shots and a truly convincing encapsulation of the story, plus some exceptional imagery in terms of both how the direction chooses to show the world of the narrative to us, and in the raw 'truth' of the depraved home of the killers.Furthermore, Leatherface's mask and hideous features just *slightly* in view under that mask are enough to show that this movie is not about violence or death, but about the disturbing contents of some minds and what they are capable of.It's a seminal classic, once hard hitting, now a lesson in making a horror movie. Sure, there's a touch of the claustrophobia as seen in Night of the Living Dead, so clearly TCM takes kudos from that previous flick. But even the best are not exempt from deriving inspiration from elsewhere.Certainly worth watching, but don't expect cheery film-making...</fullReview>

Jessica Biel is terrible. good looking but terrible. anyway, then Leatherface shows up. and the audience gets a look around the house. its starting to get a little better. After the chainsaw slaying in the woods, the movie kicks into gear and i can understand why so many people really like this film. the last 20 or so minutes the film is great. some of the stuff is funny, some of it is truly horrific. there really are some pretty scary moments in this film. this is definitely worth the rent. the moments that are great still hold up over thirty years later. awesome title for a movie too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good film, under the circumstances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" was made 30 years ago under a low budget. Considering these factors, I would have to say that Tobe Hooper has done a fantastic job! This movie is very professional - and, as all horror movies should be, very scary - and even scarier that it's based on a true story.However, I feel the need to comment on a couple of weaknesses. When Sally discovers that the old guy at the servo is a baddie, there is not enough terror conveyed on screen. The guy comes in with a rope and a sack, and Sally freaks out. Then the guy says "take it easy, everything will be okay", then he starts attacking Sally with the rope. How can anyone be frightened to death of that? Also, some shots of "Leatherface" are not scary enough. In many shots, he looks extremely confronting and sadistic, but there are times that he just looks like a "mean old man whose mother has just died", that is to say, a wimp.But, all in all, the movie was very good, and I recommend it to any horror movie fan out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What really takes the wind out of this movie is that the killers lack a clear motive. Do they kill because they prefer human meat over cow meat? If so, then why? Why would a Texas family that has led lives working in a cattle slaughter house develop a taste for human flesh? What is the point of the killing? I guess we must assume that their insane and just like killing people for no reason.The character of Leather Face come across as a big dope, a dumb fat ass, that bonks people over the head with a mallet that enters his home as they inquire seeking some help. Then its chainsaw time.The ending seems cumbersome, as that crazy slackjaw wants to bring ole grand dad downstairs to whack the girl a few time on her skull. Not a bad scene, yet something was missing, or something needed to be changed. I wasn't impressed. It just wasn't good enough for me. I wanted to be really scared and I just wasn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) is one of the most horrifying films of all times. Not only did this movie spawn three sequels but it was recently remade (badly might I add) by a big Hollywood company. It also was responsible for many knock-offs and cut rate rip-offs. Despite the fact that there's really no graphic set pieces or expensive special effects, the filmis creepy and scary as hell and it's some what based upon a true story.A group of grave robbers are raiding the small cemeteries in the back country of Texas. To this day none of them have been caught and the local authorities are clueless to who or what is doing it. A van full of young adults are traveling through the area and they bear witness to one of these "excavations". Inspite of the bad omens they continue to drive through the area until they decide to pick up a very unusual hitch hiker. This is when the fun begins.Tobe Hooper and Kin Henkel have created a modern day horror classic. Utilizing the best out of a low budget and testing the boundaries of sanity with the cast, Hooper and company have given us a crazy family that give's Manson's clique a run for the money. They have also blessed us with Leatherface, a nasty individual who's very screen presence is a true mark of horror.The writing is excellent and the cast of unknown actors give a very good performance. I have to highly recommend this film. You'll never experience a horror film as intense as this one. Like I mentioned before, it's not graphic in gore or blood (part two is all that and more) but don't let that discourage you from watching...The Texas Chain Saw Massacre!!!A+Please for the love of god don't waste your time with the remake. It'll taint your viewing and make you hate the original</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in the 70's, before Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers and Jason Vorhees were scaring you to dead, there was Leatherface, an enigmatic cold-blooded psyco,with a horrific smoking chainsaw, ready to kill anyone on his path. In that time, there were no CGI effects,and the filmmakers had to find a way to terrorize audiences in a logical and realistic way. Tobe Hooper, inspired by true events, writes a scrip about a group of teenagers traveling in a van that suddenly run out of gas and are forced to stop in the middle of nowhere,in the Texan countryside only to find a family of psychos looking for victims. One of the members of the family is leatherface, scary, big and repulsive, whose name comes from the fact that he wears a mask made out of pieces of human flesh. The story sounds simple and not really deep, but what makes this movie unique and original is its dark atmosphere and the way the elements of the story are presented. The location helps a lot creating a feeling of enormous isolation, the place is remote, out of any signs of civilization and it is anguishly hot, yes, believe me, you would not like to be cut off and lost in a place like that. One of the most terrorific scenes in the film is the one where leatherface is chasing with his lethal chainsaw one of the teenagers (a helpless girl, of course)it is distressing, endless, and makes your heart to pump blood until the verge of collapse. After this horrific masterpiece, many filmmakers took the inspiration to create most of the boogymen we know in the terror genre, and there are really good films like Halloween,and Friday the 13th 1&amp;2, as well like crappy disappointments like The House of 1000 corpses and Wrong turn. Well, just rent it and watch it, and don't expect any supereffects, or talented actors, only turn off the lights and lay back on your coach. After watching it I bet you will check the gas indicator in your car many times before going in a long trip.</fullReview>

HE, is scary. i don't know if that rad director tobe hooper did this on purpose, but it was quite funny in the first 15 minutes, and then turned a complete 180 and scared the sh** out of me! i love it, when it is not scary it is just fun. if you really like this movie, then go do yourself a favor and go watch eaten alive. same principal, executed and written differently. no cannibals, but he is a hick and he kill you and does not eat you, he leaves that job to his awesome pet croc that never dies. so if you love horror movies, mainly ones from the 70's-80's era, then Definitely buy this, rent it at least. the people who down this are used to crap like the ring and scream. booooooooooooo. check this stuff out and your life will be better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily a Classic Horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I heard or saw anything related to ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' was back in 1997, when they showed clips of memorable moments in horror cinema. They featured or showed a scene that contained a guy in a leather face chasing a girl up some stairs, and then jumping from the window. From that moment on, I always wondered what film could contain something like that. Seven years later, I find out it turns to be this movie. However, my story on how I saw this movie doesn't go too far back.My introduction to the film starts back in March, were my dad rented the remake of it. I was quite interested in seeing the movie, and enjoyed too. However, I felt my satisfaction wouldn't be complete until I saw the original version. And so, I decided to hunt for the movie and rent it, and so I did, at last. I go home, put it into my DVD player, and watch it.Boy, let me tell you, it was one wild ride. Seeing Leatherface kill all those kids was anything but not frightful. I can now understand why so many people left the theaters back then when they say it, it was disturbing, gory, and frightful. It was also unpredictable, you didn't know if the character Sally would live or not, after the hell she goes through. The realism portrayed in the movie is excellent. It's just bunch of normal teenagers going through a trip were it becomes a hell for them.''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' is great movie, sure, it may not have a lot of gore, or may seem funny in today's standards, but just because it's a low-budget movie doesn't make it ''poor'', if your a fan of horror movies, and can accept this for what it is, then I recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of THE most disturbing films ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film when I was twelve, and I am thirteen now. I had previously seen The Exorcist, Nightmare On Elm Street, etc., and those films didn't scare me. But The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is probably one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen! In the opening scene when the short synopsis explaining about the "real events", that's when you know that this is serious business. Some people say that it is very gory, but it really isn't. You see Leatherface murder people in ways that you would expect to be gory, but there really is no exposure of blood or guts or intestines. It's probably like Psycho: The shower scene was very violent, although you never actually see the knife stab Marion, which makes it gorier in our innermost minds. Rent this film if you are not gullible in the stomach or mind, 'cause if you are, you may end up in the mental institution! 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was erratic and insane, but I loved it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Classic insane horror! This movie defiantly has the "weird seventies" feel. It was two years before "Alice, Sweet Alice" and four years before "Halloween," both great masked killer movies. I'll explain the good and bad of the movie. Okay, here are the bad parts of the movie: 1) Killingwise, most of it was with a hammer, the chainsaw was used for killing once. 2) The dinnertable scene was very erratic. Those closeup shots of Sally got annoying. Only the seventies. 3) The acting actually seemed bad in the sense that it was if five teens were put in a van to talk, no script. It guess that makes it seem real and documentary-like, but when you're being entertained you usually want perfection. Now this is the good stuff: 1) The creepy opening 2) The first chase scene with Sally was excellent! 3) Grandpa is creeepy! 4) Leatherface is masterfully played. Those masks are creepy! 5) Hitchhiker and Drayton's arguments are sooo hilarious. 6) The end! (chainsaw dance my friend?) This is an insane and often totally weird film. But it is scary with its freaky madness and truly classic! 7.5 out of 10 Rated R for extreme violence, some gore, disturbing images, and graffic torture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite possibly the best ever film about a mask-wearing, chainsaw-wielding, psychotic killer ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Britain, this film is recognised as one of the most notorious 'video nasties' banned under the infamous Video Recordings Act in the 1980s. This film is ground breaking in that it paved the way for the 'slasher' genre (along with Robert Bloch's 'Psycho'). However, where 'Psycho' concentrated on 'terror' i.e. the source of our fear is largely hidden from us during the film, Tobe Hooper's character of 'Leatherface' is on-screen for a large proportion of the film.It is a popular misconception that The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (TCM) is a true story. This is mainly due to the announcement that precedes the opening scene. However, both Psycho and TCM are based loosely on the actions of Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein in the 1950's. Crucially, Gein worked alone whereas TCM introduces a family of fellow psychopaths. Evening meals at the TCM household are odd to say the least, and one can only wonder at what is on the menu!There is a fine line to be drawn between horror and comedy. However, TCM stands firmly on the side of horror. The final 30 minutes of the film are at times difficult to watch. Again, a popular misconception is that the film is full of gore. However, with the exception of the scene in which ?grandpa' feeds from the finger of Marilyn Burns (her finger was actually cut by an exhausted Gunnar Hansen), and the closing scene of the film in which Leatherface has a minor accident with his trusty chainsaw, there is a distinct lack of gore throughout. How this differs from the re-make of TCM which I recently watched. Whereas the original horrified, the re-make aims to scare the audience with elaborate special effects. The teenagers in the re-make are also decidedly cool e.g. able to hotwire cars and remaining unmoved at the presence of a dead girl in the back of their van. The world could have done without this re-make, although its success at the box office will undoubtedly result in TCM 2 being made.In summary, TCM is a groundbreaking film and deserves to be recognised as such not only by horror aficionados, but by the general public as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is NOT BASED ON A TRUE STORY. There WAS no real Leatherface. I don't care what anybody said. This has been established a million times, so all the twits who have said it's based on a real occurrence are wrong.Leatherface is BASED on a few individuals, namely Ed Gein, but just LOOSELY.FYI, it's a kickass movie too. The acting's typically dry for a slasher flick, although I think Marilyn Burns does a pretty good job. Leatherface is awesome and those other homicidal rednecks are some of the most demented I've seen.I think the concept is what is the most disturbing, which one of the above posters (re: THIS is a classic?) missed. A family of homicidal rednecks who live out in the middle of nowhere and collect god knows what, limbs, corpses, skulls (this and the skin masks ae basically what were lifted from Gein)...most slasher films are about boring twits with hockey masks or posers who invade dreams.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>******POSSIBLE SPOILERS ************************I had heard a lot of things about this movie, how scary it was and such. I had never really gotten around to seeing it until they released the 2003 version (which I haven't seen yet). I thought the movie could be that brutal, I've sat through countless incarnations of Halloween, Friday the 13th, and Nightmare on Elm Street. Boy was I wrong.I have just watched the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and it was more horrifying than anything I could have expected. When people speak of how "scary" a movie is, most talk of either the amount of gore present, or the number of jump scares. This movie has very little of either. However there is a haunting score, and tremendous suspense. Not to mention the last bit where the heroine Sally (Marilyn Burns) is tortured by the three insane Cannibals (one of which is Leatherface). That was the most intense 15 minutes or so of film I have ever watched, and the only time I have ever considered fast-forwarding a movie. I now see they say people left the theatre during the screen of this movie in the 70's. With the advent of slasher films, the victims are killed instantly, and that is the case with Sally's friends. But repeated hammer blows, broomstick and knife handle beatings are almost never seen nowadays.Marilyn Burns played the part of the heroine so well I'm surprised she didn't go insane after filming. I have seen Jamie Lee Curtis and a host of other horror heroines over the years, but none equal the performance put on by Ms. Burns. A note about the level of gore present. It is low, but I have to qualify that. Only once do we see a chainsaw cutting flesh. There are also knife blade cuts which produce blood. I would say these are no more than what you would see in a Die Hard or Schwarzenegger movie. The body count is less than an action flick or typical slasher flick. However, there is an extreme amount of torture, and abuse in this movie. Lack of gore does not mean the movie is for everyone.Only watch this movie if you're a horror fan or have a strong stomach. If you don't find this movie disturbing, or I'm you find it amusing, then you should probably check yourself into the nearest psychiatric hospital.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Classic of Survival Horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah, the 70's. A decade when filmakers made films for themselves and the audience, before the accountants infested the studios!In that respect, Texas Chainsaw Massacre goes against the grain of any horror film made in the 80's or 90's, with the exception of most Asian horror and possibly James Cameron's Aliens.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a brutal, ugly film with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. And succeeds all the more for it. The pseudo-documentary feel gives the film a distinctly unpolished look, whilst all the characters, even the teenage victims are, by degrees, particularly repellent. Especially the wheelchair-bound Franklin, of whom we are made to empathise with, not sympathise, in his isolation from the rest of the group. His disability is not patronised nor made any issue of, he is the 'runt' of the herd that is about to be slaughtered, and the film makes no apologies for it.Having said that, the film does have one redeeming feature. It is a particularly effective eco-horror movie. The Sawyer (read: Saw Yer)family, having worked for generations in the local slaughterhouse, are unable to discriminate between human and animal fodder. Their level of innate cruelty knows no bounds: if it moves, torture it-then kill it! We actually start to think about what we are doing to animals every day in turning them into burger-fodder for the masses.The anti-McDonalds/Burger King message is strong, and should make vegetarians of us all.The quality of the acting in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is unsurpassed in any film of this genre, most notably, the hitchhiker whom the teenagers pick up early in the film.Special note must be made of the soundtrack which shuns any derivative musical score in favour of a genuinely unsettling blend of industrial noise. Like everything else in this film it plays very much on the psych.There is no redemption in the finale of this movie, nor are we given any rationale for the family's actions. Everything and everyone is working on a base animal instinct to survive and in that lies the brutality and success of this film.Because of this, we come away thinking we've seen a lot more than what is actually shown. There is very little blood in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. What there is, is the psychological reduction of the audience to their basest level: that of pure instinct for self-preservation.For around 83 minutes we are witness to a survival horror stripped of all gloss and pretensions. And an audience stripped of their civility.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic horror film that becomes less scary and more enjoyable with age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having recently caught a midnight showing of Texas Chainsaw Massacre at a local theater, I was reminded how age and an audience can affect one's perspective on a film. When I first saw this film approximately 17 years ago, I was a fearless 13 year old who relished in the gore and parts that made me jump. When I watched it a few years later I had become a certified film junkie and therefore viewed it from a more clinical perspective; looking past the gore and the cheap scares and appreciating Hooper's direction more. Now, having seen it as a 30 year old I sat back and simply enjoyed it with an audience that obviously contained certified TCM fanatics. As an audience we ate up the gore, we cheered on the bad guys, castigated the teens for their profound stupidity and willed Leatherface to make mincemeat of Franklin as quickly as possible. It is not surprising that Texas Chainsaw Massacre is Tobe Hooper's first film. He gets arty with shots, (the extended scene of the close-ups of Sally's eyeball) the continuity is at times questionable and the story line is fairly weak. Having said that, it is extremely important to also mention the incredible effect this film had on American cinema. Before TCM we had very few films about serial killers. Arguably, the best known films featuring serial killing and mass murder would probably be the old monster films such as Dracula and the like. Suddenly, we have a serial killer who not only decorates his home with trinkets and furniture comprised of human and animal remains, but who chases after you with a chainsaw wearing a mask made of human skin. Not only is this a groundbreaking moment in horror film history, setting the stage for every Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees to come, but it is a film that stands the test of time and continues to have a profound impact upon viewing.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Texas Chain Saw Massacre, The (1974) Marilyn Burns, Allen Danziger, Paul A. Partain, William Vail, Teri McMinn, Edwin Neal, Jim Siedow, Gunnar Hansen, John Dugan, Robert Courtin, D: Tobe Hooper. The most shocking and influential suspense-horror picture of all time about a van of teens riding through rural Texas who get lost in the backwoods and find a house full of cannibalistic crazies! Though not as gory as its reputation states, this is not for all tastes and can be hard to watch. Claustrophobic, compelling, and disquieting. Supplies some comic genre in-jokes. Based on the Ed Gein case in Minnesota of the 1950s. Followed by two sequels, and remade in 1994 and 2002. Running Time: 84 minutes and rated R for violence and torture. ** ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PERFECT.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas chainsaw massacre is, in my opinion, the best horror movie ever and I'd like to see if I can tell why in few words and a foreign language. What did Tobe Hooper do to achieve such a perfect movie it's what i often wonder. I'm sure the hiper-realistic look the film has it's the base of it all, the photography is truly natural, no lights are positioned to give an image of threat nor there are creepy sound-tracks warning you that something bad is going to happen. The day, afternoon and night are not stormy, there are not eerie lightning , the house of the Sawyer family it's quite a regular country house ,of course inside they already redecorated it whit them particular taste, but that's totally believable because it is the doing of mad men. In fact there is a reason on why the house decoration and the character of Leatherface strike as totally original and believable and that is because they where conceived by maybe one of the most deranged man of all times, the psycho supreme, the Plainfield Wisconsin butcher, mr. Ed Gein. For those unfamiliar with the name he was the famous serial killer whose "work" inspired Robert Bloch writer of the novel "Psycho" and Tomas Harris creator of the Hannibal Lecter trilogy "Red Dragon" "Silence of the lambs" and of course "Hannibal". Yes ,one man alone. So even the most horrible facts of the movie are based on true events. Plus the actors that played the young victims did an outstanding job in the movie. The academy owes actress Marilyn Burns an Oscar for her performance, she screams and cries in such a way that the horror she is feeling is contagious. She makes you feel the madness she witness with those screams, she and the other victims were surely a big part in making the movie as realistic as possible. The movie in resume was filmed in a way that showed pretty much how would it look if any of us had the dubious honour of being invited at dinner by the Sawyer family. The unreal it's a factor that may seem ideal to help a movie being scary but it has to be carefully dosed or the thing would seem unlikely to actually happen. That is something that Hooper knew by instinct. He mastered those limits. Well i think it's enough since i am having a headache trying to express my feelings in a language i do not know to well, so I'll try not to give you one by reading more of this poor English. Though i hope i have made my point clear even if i feel i could never explain in words how much i love this movie.</fullReview>

This film is original, it'll send your mind elsewhere, but most of all, it'll scare the creeps out of you. Gunnar Hansen is superb, his performance as Leatherface is legendary is the whole horror era. This was one the the movies that sent the horror genre sky-high and Tobe Hooper's idea's have constantly been stolen by other directors, even the best of them, have borrowed elements the Tobe Hooper used in Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This is a true horror classic, it'll shock you, it'll scare you, it'll blow your mind all from the mastermind of Tobe Hooper. We salute you Tobe for bringing us one heck of a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an amazing piece of film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can remember showing this film to some friends up at college and they actually laughed at this movie. They called it boring and slow paced and did not find it scary. From the first time I viewed this movie, however, I can honestly say that I was terrified. The B- level of acting helps to add a "no-name" or "average Joe" quality to the characters of the movie that is perfect for a low budget slasher film like TCM. Tobe Hooper does an amazing job directing this picture, especially the classic chase epic at the film's climax, and the wonderful camera work done of Sally's face when she is being tortured by this family. The sounds of screeching metal and quick zoomed in shots of Sally's terrified face, and that one classic shot of Sally's eyes as she looks on in horror, and you, the audience member, are terrified for her and with her. Having Sally have an invalid brother and the quick paced start of the pick-up of the kidnapper drapes a dark curtain on this film that is not lifted until the screen goes black at the end of the movie. Oh yeah, and by the way, if you are a fan of TCM, I highly suggest the only movie in the long train of sequels to rent on video you watch is part 2...the rest are awful. Part three is weak, and Matthew McConahey and Renee Zelwegger in part 4 is just a big pile of crap. I hope the remake from New Line is as well done as the original, even though its entire cast is from WB sitcoms or something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be fair when I voted for this film (and I gave it a 9) I wasn't comparing it to _Schindler's List_, or _Metropolis_, or _Casablanca_. I was judging it within its genre, a dangerous tactic to be sure seeing that there a more than a few movies in the category that i haven't bothered with, but one that left me with a notable conclusion. I've never viewed a better horror film. Hooper's _Massacre_ makes one so uncomfortable, so physically and mentally upset with the treatment of both its unfortunate juvenile protagonists as well as the bizarre rural meat-working family, that one is left completely unhinged. Leatherface out-psychopaths (to coin a new verb) Freddie, Jason, and Michael Myers partially because one reads his torment so clearly. He's not some supernaturally horrific ghoul from beyond the grave, but an ordinary Joe down on his luck, the runt of the litter, picked on even by his own family. Okay so not ordinary. The man's lineage has been struck down to the wayside by technological advancement in the field they specialized in (livestock slaughtering) leaving them out of work. The world spins by them rapidly leaving them archaically useless, old-fashioned, and on a steady path toward perversion and hate. Then some annoying sexually precocious hooligans show up at your door all whiny and half-naked? Who wouldn't bury a sledge in a cranium or make use of that old meathook just collecting dust in the back room?Oh and besides all this psychological critique babble, its scary as all get out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this when I was about ten years old, and it seemed more spooky then scary. I mean some parts are weird while others seemed not scary. Anyway, five teens hear of graverobbing where some of the family is buried so they set out for a normal afternoon drive in Aug. They stop at the graveyard and find out that the family plots were untouched. Later on the way to Sally &amp; Franklin's Grandparents place they pick up a hitchhiker (Bad Mistake) anyway this guy seems normal but later attacks Franklin with a straight razor and they eventually get him out. They arrive at the old home and Kirk &amp; Pam decide to go swimming in an old creek behind the house, but only to find out that it is dry, so Kirk hears a engine running and he see's another house across the field, so remembering that they do need gas the two decide to wonder up and see if they can maybe buy some or just trade something off. Well when they arrive it seems like no one in home. But, some was home "Leatherface" he smacks Kirk in the head with a big hammer, and Pam who was reluctantly didn't want to go in, Now having heard a struggle goes in only to find a very weird home littered with bones,dead animals, and even a"Live" chicken in a bird cage!. Anyway see gets grabbed and impaled on a meat-hook. Later, Jerry (Sally's Boyfriend) goes looking for them and he also gets slaughtered. So all that's left is Sally &amp; Franklin. Sally decides to look for them all but it very hard cause Franklin is in aWheelchair and it's difficult for her to push him through the brush and it is also dark out now. Franklin hears something and when he turns his flashlight up Leatherface is right in front saw him up.Sally freaks (who wouldn't?) anyway she runs from the big cute guy with the chainsaw. She comes across a gas station, with a very weird owner, who actually is the brother of Leatherface. So he knocks her out and ties her up and homeward bound they go. On the way he see's that hitch-hiker that we saw earlier, he too is related to the others. So after waking up she at the dinner table with this weird bunch. Only to find out that Grandpa is ready to give her a hammer to the head. She escapes and Leather &amp; the Hitch-hiker chases after her but the Hitch-hiker's fate is right in your face when he gets run over by a big semi, and she hails down a passing pickup truck were she jumps in the back and they speed away while leaving Leatherface in a foul mood while give a great little chainsaw dance. That's it! know that I told you the whole plot no need to watch it!!! LOL :-) No really if you have some time check it out it might suprise you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it does have it's scary moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was OK, but I was expecting better. This movie could almost pass for PG-13. There is no blood or gore; about the only scene that would make it an R would be when the girl is put on the hook. Any recent war movie has far more graphic violence then this. But, the film does have some make-you-jump-out-of-your-seat moments. And, you often find yourself saying how stupid these kids are for just walking into someone's house and messing around in a place they were warned against.(SPOILERS):The grandpa of Leatherface's family was quite different, shall we say dead looking. His part was rather funny. And it was so gross when he sucks on Sally's finger. One criticism is about the last 20 minutes all Sally does is scream very loud and that starts to get annoying. And couldn't we have seen a little blood during the final chase seen. We just get a guy run over and a little chainsaw-skin contact.Definitely the best part is when Sally is pushing Franklin and he turns the flashlight to where he heard a noise. There is Leatherface and the chainsaw starts. Now, that was scary. It was also very tense when Sally is in the gas station with the door wide open, waiting for the guy to get the truck. FINAL VERDICT: Pretty good, but don't expect a lot of gruesome scenes. This is worth a viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I personally define a great movie as one that can bring your true emotions out in a matter of an hour or two. What better emotion than FEAR?! Texas Chainsaw Massacre, as crued as the footage may be, still has the power to make the most "brave" movie viewer shake in their boots. What's scarier than a psycho wearing another person's face chase after you? I know I know, you're saying "Duh, Lechter did it in Silence of the Lambs." True, but Lechter wasn't waving a chainsaw around like a maniac, was he? The sound in the movie alone is enough to give you the willies. Even the introduction read by John Laroquette can creep you out a little. This movie HAS to be a classic if it still has the power to scare the be-jeez-us out of its audience.Beware, however... the sequels are VERY disappointing. I mean who wants to see the horrific Leatherface who butchered innocent teens in the first get off by rubbing his saw the "oh so right way" in the lame sequel? Watch the original, but stay away from the rest of the "series."Do yourself a huge favor, watch this movie alone, in the dark, in the middle of the night in order to get the full effect or terror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has plenty of good scares and is very strange as well. Hearing the title, "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," you think it sounds like a silly B-Movie. It isn't. Rather, the title makes it sound like what you'd call an actual event. I don't want to give anything away like the trailers do, so I'll just recommend seeing this movie if you want a few good scares. Real good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror movies ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has been long banned in different countries, among them Germany. But why? Hardly no blood is seen and spilled, and one nasty scene with a woman being hooked up is intense, but unbloody. So what makes this movie watchable? Above all, it's message is simple, but effective. In one scene, a group of teenagers (in an old VW-bus) are passing a cattle farm, where the cattle is waiting to be slaughered. They pick up a strange hiker alongside the road, and when a guy in a wheelchair starts glorifying the slaughtering of the cattle (..they make headcheese...) he is cut with knife by the hiker. This is the onset of their deadly journey, only two of them will survive. The VW-bus scene is central, and shows that the director wanted to mix the treatment of cattle and of the group: they are treated like cattle(one of them is slain with a big butcher hammer) and hooked like animals. Although there is never graphic violence, the movie is (above all for horror movie beginners) hard to endure: because of hearsay, a lot of gruesome chainsaw action with guts and blood spilling is expected. But nothing about that. There are by far more bloody movies. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is, although cheaply made and done, a horror gem that has already give its place in the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In Germany, a slightly cut version has been re-edited by the SPIO/JK committee. It is worth taking a look, although the real fan will want to see the original one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THIS is my kinda show!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Try this on for size: You've just gotten word that there've been some vandals on the loose, running about, robbing graves and what-not. You and a bunch of your college buddies decide to load up the van with beer, hot-dogs, and your idiotic, wheel-bound cousin Franklin, and head out to the old family homestead to make sure that no one has been tampering with Grammy and Grampy's grave. Along the way you encounter and pick-up a goofball hitchhiker and a weirder than weird gas-station attendant.Now anyone with half a brain would say "Forget Grammy and Grampy. We're going home!!" Not in this movie. No Sir. It's a good thing for us too, that all of the characters in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre are all beyond-stupid. In short, this movie has it all, then plenty more on top of that. It can also be said that this one is nowhere NEAR as gory as its reputation suggests and I can only remember one death-by-chainsaw.My favorite part of the movie (and character): Franklin. This guy definitely has a problem or two. His childish behavior and obnoxious monologues (I'm mainly referring to his in-depth description of a slaughterhouse...funny stuff) had me in stitches. The guy may have gotten on my nerves, but I found him hilarious all the same. In fact, when time came for his untimely-demise, I actually stood up and applauded. This one scene alone is reason enough to OWN this movie. It's classic.If you haven't seen this movie and you call yourself a "horror-fan", then you must be one of those types who still has a bed-time (not a bad thing). Just do yourself a favor and pick up this dvd. It's great for non-stop laughs and it's a great one to throw in your player when you've got the guys over, drinking some beers.It may not be a good idea to view this one with a date...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a lesson of film-making. It is realistic enough to be extremelly disturbing, but at the same time it is so classy and sophisticated that it turns out to be a delightful visual and auditive experience. The events are realistic, the camerawork is documentary style, and the narration at the begining which states it was a true event is absolutely chilling; but still, the bad guys are so farcical and cinematic, that at the same time one feels this is taking place only in MovieLand, as if it was something really fantastic.It is the only movie I've seen which has both realistic and fantastic atmospheres at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terrifying! This movie starts like a low-budget flick (like most good 1970's movies do), but the momentum does build up. Keeping in mind that this story is based on a true account makes it all the more horrific. The movie is filmed as if you--yourself is right there. In some scenes you see what the victim sees as if you are the victim. I give credit to actress Marilyn Burns who had to constantly scream and act terrified. The moral of this story is never pick up a hitch hiker or drifter and never walk on someone else's property and enter their house when you know you are not suppose to. What a surprise that John Larroquette is the narrator at the beginning of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>*** out of 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something very unsettling about this brutal slasher flick that makes it very hard to watch. When you say Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the 13th should instantly come to mind, for it was these two that made slasher movies into a genre of their own. But when you pop in Friday the 13th you kick back, relax and have a good time. You know it's stupid and horribly cheesy in every way but the entertainment value is still high. But as Texas Chainsaw Massacre plays on it goes way beyond the realm of entertainment and you may even be felling a little guilty for seeing what is happening on screen. Our story sees us following five teens, one van and the deserted Texas countryside. When they decide to bunk in an abandoned farmhouse they are killed off one by one by a cannibalistic butcher with a chainsaw named Leatherface and his macbre, grave robbing family. Although it is a low budget slasher flick that looks like another stupid teen exploition movie, several of the scenes are downright scarey. The violence is strong and relentless, this is by no means for the faint of heart or the narrow of mind. In fact even the strongest willed person will probably be guarenteed an nightmare or two. To top it all off, the film is supposidly based on actual events making it all more disturbing, but to what extent of the material is true is up to your own imagination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Film ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tobe Hooper's "TCM" has it all! I cannot think of another film to equal this one as far as interesting characters are concerned, and 99% of what makes a film work is an excellent cast! We have this amazing family of grave robbing killers, who also kill the living at times and use them for BBQ at some gas station that one of them owns. There is Leather Face, There is The Hitchhiker, There is the old man(the fellow who sells the human BBQ), and of course, there's Grandpa too. All of these characters are a mystery in American culture, and we have seen them all at one point or another. The Hitchiker works on a variety of different levels, he's the disturbed child, the sadistic killer, but he's also just a young guy looking for a good time. Leather Face is truly like a Jack The Ripper of sorts, because it is painfully difficult to figure out who and what he is all about, but, then again, perhaps he is just a meaningless beast? The old man is able to blend in with everyday people quite easily, by wearing the mask of a southern gentlemen, although I use the term very loosely. Grandpa is a classic character if there ever was one, because we often see in society, those who look so painfully awful that they make us physically sick, and Grandpa is a very good example of this sort of person. The victims are quite funny, and you do actually care about them to a certain extent, which is entirely rare for even the best of horror films. Also, a couple of the victims actually have fully developed personalities and are more than just one note characters to be laughably killed. I could carry on about this film for quite some time, because it works on every level any decent film works on. You will laugh, you will cry, and it will truly make you think. One last thing, the entire cast were very desperate performers and artists working in the medium of film when this feature was put together, and it really shows in the final product. Everybody involved added so much to create for a truly unique cinematic experience. I must also add that I am very fond of the female lead, because she needs not one person to help her when horrible and troubling situations occur, she survives by will alone. And if this review seems painfully vague to you, then perhaps you should simply rent the film so that you can watch the brilliant story unfold for yourself?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must-see for horror fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" makes one realize just how watered down modern horror has become. Much of the recent crop consists of irritating "teeny-bopper" flicks, existing solely to market the images of today's hot young stars. In fact, the horror elements are usually a superficial pretext, only successful due to aggressive marketing. Thus, we are faced with the sad fact that many teenagers have not have the chance to experience true horror. In today's conservative political climate, many 1980s horror films could not be financed, much less produced and released.With that in mind, getting back to the basics provides a much-welcome shock to the senses. TCM refuses to soften its tone to avoid offending anyone. It is pure, unfiltered terror; claustrophobic, gritty, unrelenting. In terms of content, the violence level is not any better or worse than average. What makes it work is the psychological impact upon the viewer. First-time director Tobe Hooper pervades the film with an unsettling, almost documentary realism. Its grainy, low-budget appearance actually contributes to its overall effect; there are times when we forget it's only a movie.Although the film does take its time in setting things up, the results are worth it. As events progress, the terror grows and grows, never letting up. By the time we get to the climax, we feel trapped in a nightmare, desperately hoping for release. Unlike many other slashers, we do not root for the killer, but share in the young victims' terror. There is little humor to be found in this grim, queasy tale. No comic relief, no compromise. Just horror, plain and simple. The opening crawl claims that it's based on a true story. This is a half-truth, actually. It's inspired by the ghoulish crime spree of the Ed Gein, who earned infamy for dissecting corpses (mostly from grave-robbing) and keeping body parts around the house. The true horror of the film is that people like Leatherface really do exist, and that events such as these depicted in the film have actually happened from time to time. The viewer is acutely aware that there is a chance, however remote, that he could be the next victim of some madman.***1/2 (out of ****)Released by Bryanston Films Ltd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cutting-Edge Cult Horror...LITERALLY</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few films, horror or otherwise, have ever approached THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE in the controversy department. When it was first released around Halloween in 1974, it caused a furious firestorm over its alleged depravity and exploitational use of blood and gore. Not surprisingly, of course, CHAINSAW became a huge hit, going on to earn between thirty and forty million dollars on a budget of less than $500,000.Loosely based on the Ed Geinn case, the one that also inspired Hitchcock's PSYCHO, CHAINSAW focuses on a group of Texas teens who fall prey to a family of ghoulish cannibals in rural Texas. One of the "family" is a deranged character known as "Leatherface" (Gunnar Hansen), whose tool of trade is not a knife or a hatcher, but a McCulloch chainsaw. And the teens who find their way to the family's home after they are unsuccessful finding a filling station in the middle of nowhere will find themselves at the mercy of this depraved bunch. Only one of them (Marilyn Burns) will survive...and even she won't survive in one piece (psychologically speaking).The film remains notorious to this day for its alleged extreme gruesomeness: body parts, buckets of blood, the loud, whirring chainsaw, etc. But as Hitchcock had done with PSYCHO, in CHAINSAW, director Tobe Hooper, who later went on to make POLTERGEIST, leans more towards suggestion than extreme violence. Only in a scene in which one of the teens is strung up on a meat hook (shades of A MAN CALLED HORSE) is there any real bloodshed. Often put in the same place of other cinematic bloodbaths of dread like LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT or NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, CHAINSAW seems to me to actually be a more extreme version of films like STRAW DOGS and DELIVERANCE, two other shocking horror films set in rural back country and dealing with violence and subhuman behavior.The morbid combination of claustrophobia, scathing black comedy, and naturally realistic acting from a cast of rank amateurs helps give CHAINSAW its bleak, almost documentary-like quality. Horror and suspense fans shouldn't hesitate to pick it up on video, but be warned: the 'R' rating the film received is there for a reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>UNNERVING HORROR FILM</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie it really unnerved me. For starters, it was like watching a documentary. During the movie I couldn't help but wonder whether the psychotic family were really sadistic killers. They're not actors I thought to myself. The realism in this film was truly unnerving.There were no special effects and the camerawork made you believe you were watching a documentary.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)The film itself is brilliant. It's really scary because there's a weird family living out in the sticks and they're truly demented. I felt a bit sick when I saw the scenes in the house with bones cluttering up the place and Leatherface cutting up dead bodies. And the scene at the dinner table where Sally was tortured was downright disturbing.Jim Siedow played a wonderful part as the cook who was totally insane. Edwin Neal also played a great part as the hitchhiker character who was downright twisted. And who can forget the inhuman Leatherface.One of the best scenes in this film is where Leatherface chases Sally through the forest. He just doesn't give up and pursues her relentlessly. Then she runs into a garage where she meets Jim Siedow and it looks like she's going to be safe...until the viewers realise that Jim Siedow is one of the family.What a scary film. What scared me the most was the fact that this weird family was living in an isolated area where no one could hear any screams for help. Sometimes in real life, I find myself driving down country lanes and I see farmhouses in the distance and I think to myself, "Please don't break down here." I've never been able to look at a farmhouse in the same way since seeing this film.If you haven't seen this film, rent it now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A True Classic. The First Time I Had Ever Watched This was When I Was About 7 yrs. Old. My Mom Had Told to Keep It On The Movie Shelf and Not Watch It. But When She Went to Play Bingo With a Friend and Left me With a Baby-Sitter, I Ran Off Into My room and Ploped it into the VCR. I Was Scared. I Turned It Off About 10 Minutes into the Film. It Was To Scary. I Mainly just Hated the Corpse at The Begenning. I Later Watched it When I Was 14 and really Liked It. Now I Am A true fan of this film and others similar to it. I Just Wish It Could Have Been More Truly Based on the Real Life Serial Killer Ed Gein. But other than that, I Hope this movie Continues to enter into The Collection of the more "Younger" Horror Fans. Horror Movie these Days Don't Really Live up to their Purpose. Instead of Scaring the Viewer, They tend to Excite the Viewer. Others in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre's Era (Halloween, Friday The 13th, Phantasm) Seemed to have Adopted the Spookyness of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Slowly and Sadly, It Died off.  The Film Itself Contains Bits and Parts of Gore, though not an Excessive amount. I Think The Film also Tries to Show the Viewer Pure Madness. This was Perfectly Shown towards the end, When the Lone Survivor was Tied to the Table. Her Bloodcurdling Screams only could amount to the Psychotic Laughs of Leatherface and his Family. Who would I Reccommend this Movie to? Anyone over 10 yrs. Of Age. Anyone. Grade--A+ Also Reccommended: Slumber Party Massacre, Sorority House Massacre, Halloween, Prom Night, SleepAway Camp, Bloody Murder, Child's Play, Nightmare on elm street, and The Ugly.</fullReview>

It defined a genre, that of a maniac with a thirst for blood and gore, and transcended it at the same time. Loosely, and I do mean loosely, based on a real serial killer back in the fifties, this movie has a grainy real feeling that was cheaply and ineptly imitated by the Blair Witch Project. I have seen this movie repeatedly and it really only gets better. The unfortunate train wreck that is the second movie only makes the movie that much better.

		<fullReview>For one, this movie is not gory at all. Ive seen X-Files episodes bloodier than this. It does contain one of the creepiest mothers ever to grace the friggin' screen, Leatherface. Actually, there are just some sick, backwater, weird-ass, wacked, dingy, goofy, bucktoothed, seedy, nasty individuals in this one. That hitchhiker alone is worth the price of admission. Lots of stuff in this movie will stay with you long after you've seen it. Watch this one late at night. I label this a "STFU" movie. What's STFU? It means "Shut the F*** Up". Guaranteed that if you put this movie on when you have a house full of people and they're making a lot of noise, they will quiet down once it gets rolling. Another prime example is the Exorcist, any version of the film. It's not a slick production but it only adds to the charm. One to have in your collection. One last thing: if you want laughs, cue up Steppenwolf's "Born to be Wild" and start it right when the movie's big chase scene starts. It's pretty funny and goes perfectly with what's on the screen.

		<fullReview>I'm not sure what too many city folk think of this movie, but I live just outside of my city of 100,000 people. Sort of a farm area with forests, fields, and my street just dropped in there somewhere. There's a couple of old busted up looking houses and broken barns and such, so when I saw this movie, the whole setting felt a little close to home. The thought of some neighbour bursting out of their house with a chain saw seemed all too possible.By presenting the movie as a "this actually happened" movie, a very real feeling is obtained. The semi-poor 70s film quality and the very natural acting makes the movie seem less like a movie and more like something that could have taken place. I think this "real" feeling is what scared me so much, considering every time i look anywhere but my street I see houses like the one in the movie. There are other things I'd like to comment on but I won't so as not to give away any of the movie. You'll just have to see it yourself (and SOON)!The ONLY way to watch this movie is at sometime after 1am, in total darkness. This is how i saw it the first time and it turned out to be one of the only movies that ACTUALLY scared the crap out of me. The 2nd time i watched it with a group of friends, joking around, lights on, and no one in the room liked it. So spend the time watching it in the dark, you'll probably want to sleep with the light on anyway.</fullReview>

The extreme closeups, the chase scenes and murders are all done with flair and come off realistic without showing any blood and guts. The constant screaming, crazed laughter and chainsaw buzz fill the soundtrack so well and with such terror that there's no need for any music. OK so there's no plot, but you won't even care because there's so much action and horror going on, any stabs at character development would just kill the frenetic pace and overall insanity of it all.It's unfortunate that Hooper never directed anything close to the brilliance of this. Poltergeist had potential, but it's obvious Speilberg got his grubby hands on that one and turned it into a special effects extravaganza for the whole family. I would have liked to see what that clown and those spirits really would of done if Hooper had control. Little Carol Anne would have died of fright.4 out of 4 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry to interrupt the love fest, but I thought the incessant screaming detracted from the whole movie. I was so distracted by the "victim's" non-stop screaming, that it took the edge off the movie and made me cheer for the baddies to get her. Then maybe she'd shut up.Also, what stupid-ass runs away from someone in the dark and repeatedly screams to make sure the bad guy doesn't loose them.Anyway, besides that, I thought the props and look and feel of the movie was excellent. Plus the soundtrack was very unique. A nice signature to the film.</fullReview>

And rewatching itagain, there's really not a real plot or meaning to the film.But somehow, it such pure cinematic genius. Anyone interested incinema, should check this one out. Texas Chain Saw Massacre islike cinema's primal scream.This movie is absolutely relentless in it's attempt to scare anddisgust you, and finally drive you out of your mind. I don't care howmany Screams you've seen, this one will scare you. It's amazingthat a film this old, with a relative slow pace, doopy seventiescostumes and what not, still packs such a punch even today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie that defies the word HORROR</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen a lot of movies where they made comments on how scary this movie was, whether it was a kid staying up late to watch it or whatever. I never really knew what it was about, I thought it was just a guy going around the town killing people with his chainsaw, which is what the plot of every new horror movie is. I first watched this about 5 months ago with a friend, and we put the tape in at about midnight. I have to admit, the first part of the movie is a bit slow, but then again, so is The Exorcist, which is another extremely scary movie. The second part of the movie more than makes up for the first part though. People complain about how this movie "wasn't gory enough," yet the movies these days that use so much gore aren't even scary, they're stupid. This movie didn't need gore. The killings in this movie used pretty much no gore, but they were extremely disturbing, and frightening. Trust me, when you watch this, the first kill will just freak you out, it is so unexpecting, and then it happens. What makes this movie even more horrific and disturbing, is knowing that are people out in this world like that. In fact, Leatherface was based on a real serial killer back in the 50's. Everything in this movie is what every horror movie now doesn't have. I can see how this movie was really arguemental when it came out, people just weren't ready and expecting that kind of movie, even now it's still really disturbing to watch. This movie is by far one of the best horror movies ever made, and should be watched by every horror fan out there, or even a movie fan.</fullReview>

And I would also say that Leatherface is one the top horror villains of all time. That would also include Freddy, Jason, Michael, and Chucky. Tm2 and Tm3 are pretty good too considering that they were made in the 80's and were sequels. The next generation is horrible and doesn't fit in with the other 3 movies. This movie is for people who generally appreciate a damm fine work of cinematic history. Forget gone with the wind and Ben Hur, this film is a classic and should be reconized as one! 10/10, (or higher)</fullReview>

Then for the second time it was much better, because I got the bizarre atmosphere and the semi-documental character. TCM is a modern horror classic, that has influenced many other films like "Silence of the lambs" for example. The second part of TCM is okay (it´s much better than all sequels of "Friday the 13th" together, but that´s my opinion...), part 3 is quite weak (I only saw the cut version) and the remake with Renee Zellweger is complete b******t..!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the classic film of terror &amp; cannabalism. It is exellent and scores right up there with the Exorcist, and the Evil Dead. The story is about 5 friends who are going to see their grandfathers house. They pick up a crazed hitchhiker, and everything goes wrong. They investigate the house, get bored, and walk in the field . they all sneak into the house and one by one get brutily murdered by Leatherface. Sally's handicapped brother gets murdered with a chainsaw, and then she runs into the crazed family's home. If I told you anymore, then it would spoil the movie. Rated R for: Strong Violence, and gore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful and disturbing film, even 20 yrs or so later</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is currently being shown on the Independent Film Channel , probably the best channel on my cable system. If you want to relive this movie and I bet you do, check it out. This review will cover some aspects of the movie not yet covered by even the most sincere horror critics. First off this film gets a 9 out 10. It is a breakthrough film.This film has it all, both good and bad points but the best thing I can say about it is that it is scary, it has great suspense and the characters are real which heightened the realism of the movie.The bad.Degradation of women, we hear "hit that bitch" in one scene. However to its defense this is what sets it apart from hollywood films. Degradation and exploitation of women in the movies during the 70's was taking place but it was kept inside the closets. This movie exposes that.The good. Great shots of skeleton on a wall. Sick humor moments as when Sally is locked up in the truck of that sadistic gas man and is constantly being poked and whacked by him for sheer pleasure.The good and the bad. 2nd half of the film is really what's disgusting ,yet amazingly real. Real in that these kinda of sick individuals do exist in society from serial killers who committed cannabilism toward others;There is a story behind the skin lamp shades shown in the movie as Tobe Hooper pointed in the Independent Film Channel , he was told a story when he was 7 or 8 yrs old about some individual who bought some lamp shades that were made with human skin, this undoubtly shook him and he used this in the movie.The villains in this movie wont get any lifetime acting achievement awards. Their roles in this movie are sick and in many times youd wish they die since their roles involve getting pleasure from torturing Sally.The best character in the movie is not Leatherface (although Gunnar Hansen undoubtly lays the foundation for a chainsaw killer) but Franklin (the wheelchair bound guy) who you feel sorry for, because even his so called friends mistreat him and this where I did get some satisfaction in the film because Leatherface gets rid of them.Best scene in the film? The end of course when we Sally escaping . By the end of the film Sally is so crazy from being tortured that she laughs in leatherface's face when she gets away. This was the best part of the film because it show that this girl's spirit wasnt broken and she wins the war with Leatherface.Great horror movie. P.S. When you going into the meat section of the supermarket,this film will make you think twice about where that meat comes from.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Innovative use of violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a landmark film for its use of violence. Instead of the usual horror movie build-up, with suspense music and the like, Chain Saw springs the violence on you without warning. The deaths are startling for their realism. The horror builds in some subtle ways--shots of road-killed animals unsettle you early on, and a little blood is used suggestively to make you imagine you've seen a lot of gore. The film looks cheap, but Hooper's direction makes sophisticated use of motifs, focus changes, and other innovative techniques. An early scene involving flash photography is incredibly disturbing. Much of the story is implied rather than explained, so the movie gets better with repeat viewings.This may be too weird and intense for some viewers, but if you're open to that sort of thing, give this one a chance. One of the scariest (but funniest) movies I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shocking experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw "Texas Chain Saw Massacre" by Tobe Hooper. I didn't wanted to see other "Texas", I wanted to see the first one before. This was a weird experience. It was cool because at halfway of the movie I thought everybody was falling too fast and was expecting a known end. How wrong was I. The final moments where very shocking, and until the end got me with my eyes wide open. I didn't wanted to compare it to Evil Dead, but the low budget feel and weird shots reminds me of Raimi´s masterpiece, but then I realized that this movie was made almost 10 years after? (and so it makes it more cool), sure people run of the theaters with this??. One very cool thing it was that unlike other films this wasn't actually a tale of zombies or vampires but about demented people with an special dinner menu (some images of Ed Gain came to my mind). Other thing that I really like about this movie was the realism and simplexes of the acting. I hate that when people is confronting an incredible menace they say those stupid cuotes (A trend Raimi also parody but that later also become a cliché too). In this film people scream like crazies, and even that the screaming was annoying at a time, I wouldt expect less. The scream is very important thing on a state of hysteria. When one is having a nightmare, one feels the urge of scream as hard as one can, like trying to break with the moment or disconnect the conciusness. But this wasn't a bad dream and so the senses reach the point of breakdown. The tale follows with realism and not falling in holes or f**k ups. I like this movie a lot and even that I had to wait many years to saw it, it was well worth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twin Brother to Last House on the Left(1972)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre(1974) belongs with Last House on the Left(1972), The Exorcist(1974), Dawn of the Dead(1978), Deep Red(1975), and The Omen(1976) as some of the best horror films to come out of the 1970's. John Larroquette of Night Court fame has a cameo as the voice over narrator. Its not the gory film that many people make it out to be. What probably made this film controvosial is the intensive and shocking aspects of the violent scenes in this feature. The Scene where a woman is hung up on a meat hook is brutal and very unsettling.Gunnar Hansen as Leatherface is boldful in his depiction of a cannibalistic chainsaw killer. Leatherface is the first of the slasher villains as he predates ones like Freddy, Jason, and Michael by several years. I enjoyed the scene where the grandfather is having a hard time handling a hammer. The dinner scene is reminiscent of the infamous wedding feast from Tod Browning's Freaks(1933). One film its shares with in its dark and pessemistic outlook is Wes Craven's Last House on the Left(1972).TCM's Leatherface is based on the case of infamous serial killer Ed Gein who also inspired the films Deranged(1974) and Psycho(1960). This is a motion picture that The Blair Witch Project aspired to be. The direction by Tobe Hopper is first class and the imagery is a combination of humorish and nightmarish qualities. The documentary feel adds a realistic aspect to the movie's narration. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a rare example of implicit horror used to its fullest effect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror the way it should be done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film shows that a lot of the best movies ever made, were made with almost no budget. What about Pulp Fiction, Taxi Driver, Tesis, Nosferatu, Being John Malkovich, and countless others? The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has a documentary feeling to it that makes it so realistic you really believe those things are happening. I think the best example is when one of girls enters the house and falls into the floor only to contemplate a grotesque room. That is a very disturbing scene, you almost feel what she's feeling. The chase scene is very powerful, but it is topped by the one at the table, where the constant takes on eyeballs and bones give you the creeps like no other film can. I have never seen another horror flick that is so intense and satisfying as this one, because it's a supreme achievement in cinematography in a lot of ways. There is no we're-telling-you-the-killer-is-on-his-way music in here. Almost no blood. No soundtrack - just noises which become really scary through the movie -. I think The Blair Witch Project didn't copy things from this, just studied it's formula, and used it in a different direction. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre should be one of the best movies America has ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This legendary exploitation shocker until very recently was totally banned in the UK. So when it came out on video I must admit that I expected it to have lost all of its impact. As it turned out if anything The Texas Chain Saw Massacre has gained even more power to terrify and disturb over the past 25+ years. This film is just 80 minutes of pure terror! While there is very little blood and guts the movie creates such a realistic atmosphere and that is what creates the terror. The film manages to tap into our most deep seated fears of death and then plays upon them without mercy making what little violence there is very hard to watch. The film also succeeds in making you jump out of your seat on more than one occasion and contains the most rivetting chase sequence in the history of cinema. It is hard to see anyone not being scared by this movie and I strongly believe that it is the best horror film that has ever been made. Essential viewing for everyone, just dont let the kiddies see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is a very scary, most unusual horror film. Tobe Hooper made his directorial debut with this film which is supposedly based on fact. That aspect of the film makes watching this a really creepy experience. It's about five young people who stumble onto a family of crazy Texans in which one of them kills by using a chainsaw. Then take a guess what the real purpose of this is for. I first saw this movie when I was just 14 years old and I didn't like it that much. But it has grown on me over the last couple of years and today I find this to be a truly terrifying motion picture. It's shocking and disturbing. The last half of this film (with lead Marilyn Burns running and screaming for her life) had me on the edge of my seat. And wouldn't you know. The movie is narrated by a then unknown John Larroquette! There are a few silly moments here and there (most of those are provided by Burns' handicapped brother), but "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is one scary movie. *** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of horrormovies, but it isn't very often I see a really good one. We have classics like THE SHINING, but it is still not a masterpiece in horror. THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE is a worthy opponent to everyone else in the horror genre. To be honest I have seen better horrormovies, but saying that I wasn't scared is a lie, cause most of the time I was. Still to get the 8 it had to have something more, I'm sorry but I can't put my word on it.I'd say this is a very surreal film. It has got similarities to Lucio Fulci's THE BEYOND and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, but this is on another level, the whole ending almost made me scream so disgusting was it. And that chase in the woods was also a scare. Anybody who is freaked on horror will probably love this. The one who didn't are probably moralists or, if it's possible, fans to the awful sequel.I give this movie 7.5/10 but stay away from any kind of similarities. The only good movie that contains TCM is ''How I spent my Summer Vacation'', and that's a Tiny Toons-video.</fullReview>

While the beginning can be somewhat comical, at least the parts where the teen costars go into the Family's house one by one, the last thirty or so minutes are both terrifying and breathtaking.

It has an unforgettable killer. And is presented in a brutal real life style that gets under your skin and will leave you scared to the bone. Do not watch this one alone. One of Tobe Hooper's first films and his best work to date. A genre masterpiece. Rating: 8.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Do you think that guy'll try to follow us?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course, the guy in question doesn't actually follow them, but they walk right into his house in a movie which defies classic character stupidity. This is less a horror film that makes you cry "don't go into the cellar"; than "don't go into that spooky old deserted house covered in dirt with dead animals' heads hanging on the wall and a squealing pig in the kitchen, particularly when you've just given a lift to a hitch-hiking madman who tried to knife you and said he worked in the local abattoir".When I first saw this in the rental outlet I misread the title and presumed it was about a series of murders in a local DIY hardware shop - The Texas Chain Store Massacre. Okay, I didn't, it was just an excuse for my pathetic joke, but I was relieved to find that the film is actually set in a confines and atmosphere that do lead to ten or fifteen minutes of genuine terror. Banned in England for years, viewers today may spend more time laughing at the hippie studentspeak, along with the flares and sideburns, but at the end result there's nothing scarier than a deserted house in pitch darkness where a leathermasked man chases you with a chainsaw.Ultimately, you could see why it would be banned - there's no plot, no message, no agenda. It has nothing to say, and does nothing to condemn the behaviour demonstrated within. It's not even based upon a deeper psychology, as with The Driller Killer. The film is solely a surreal look at Southern sensibilities and outcast behaviour. Of course, anyone that's seen American Psycho will know what's going to happen up until just two minutes before the end, thanks to that movie's spoiler display of the video in the background. Not that it matters. While the real scares come in the chase between the moody Sally (Marilyn Burns) and the lip-licking Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen), the last fifteen minutes see the tension dissipated as what has been underlying the film all along - a sense of camp self-parody - comes to the fore. We're introduced to Grandfather (John Dugan), essentially an ashen-faced corpse, who is designated the one who tries to strike a fatal blow to Sally's head. We watch as the arthritic grandfather tries in vain to hit her head with a mallet, his shaky hands constantly dropping the hammer with sub-comic effect. This can be a really silly film, as with the man in a HGV lorry who gets out and starts running... plot illogic, genre clichés and stereotypical character flaws are all built in to the plot with what was, I assume, self-aware irony. Pointless yet great fun, while the film is ultimately a joke, it is a good one, and for several minutes does achieve the aim of being genuinely terrifying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I was only 9 or 10 and it was and still is the scariest movie I've ever seen. Having such a small budget made it look more gritty and like a documentary . It's very underrated compared to such other horror classics such as The Exorcist or Halloween while I believe that this is one of the greatest horror movies ever made. Even though there have been tons of more gory films released since this has come out, it doesn't look dated and it still shocks people today.This movie is very disturbing and leaves a lasting effect on people because it's always been said to have been a very violent film while there's hardly any onscreen violence. The acting and directing is so good that it's still able to scare you without tons of gore. The dinner scene at the end where the grandfather continues to try and hit Marilyn Burns' head is so grueling because you feel so bad for her. The final scene showing Leatherface swinging the chainsaw around in the air is a great ending to an excellent film.If you watch American Psycho, you'll notice Texas Chainsaw Massacre playing in the background while Patrick Bateman works out.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are a lot of supposedly good Classics like The Shining (1980), The Omen (1976), Rosemary's Baby (1968) or The Exorcist (1973), which had a supposedly big influence on movie-making. Well I don't think they are good, I mean of course The Shining and The Exorcist are of course Classics, they have a certain something and they can be watched these days too, because they are pretty descent. But the Omen and Rosemary's Baby, now that are two weak films, I don't know why they are so FAMOUS. They are BAD. But now on to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which had me belive for a moment it was actually based on a true story. It was good man, this is a classic and a good one too. It has great directing, a good story, good actors and so on. There is not as much blood in it as I expected there would be, but it still is gruesome. Leatherface is the best killer I have seen in a film up to date, he RULES. The directing style is superb and it sometimes reminded me of another great flick whose directors certainly know this one: The Blair Witch Project. This one is not to be missed by Horror fans and Film-freaks. It is one of the few TRUE classics.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is one of those rare films that if you can actually sit through a complete viewing, you feel very rewarded that you did.The plot is simple.....a group of teens set out for an afternoon of fun, and run across a sadistic backwoods "family".This, of course, sets the horrific events into motion, leading to some of the most terrifying moments in horror history. The movie is shot almost documentary style, even including an opening narration by a then unknown John Larroquette. The grainy look to it only enhances that feeling.Unlike horror films today, which depend almost solely on gore to provide shocks, TCM uses suspense and the sheer horror of almost showing you what happens, but never do you actually see a chainsaw touch flesh until close to the end of the movie."Texas Chainsaw" is a true test....if you can sit through this brutal movie, then you are truly a horror film fan.....this is not a movie for the squeamish, and the chainsaws whirr will haunt you for the remainder of the day. A true classic, one that leaves you drained and breathless..but entertained.5 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic horror film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to see why this is considered to be one of the finest horror films of all time. I expected this movie to be a typical gore-fest but to my surprise, it wasn't. While there was a fair amount of blood in the film, the movie relied heavily on atmosphere and mood instead.Like "Blair Witch Project," this movie takes the technical limitaions given to it by the immensely low budget and uses them to the film's advantage. The almost toal lack of lighting gives the film a real creepy atmosphere, particularly in the scenes set inside the house. The grainy cinemetography really adds to this as well. The camera work in the movie was done very well also.Special mention should be given to Marylin Burns. In a role that could've easilly become your generic slasher-film screamer, she gave a very convincing performance. She really looked like someone who was genuinely terrified and gradually being driven insane by this nightmare she was living through.This is a horror film that does a great job in overcomming the budgetary and technical limitations presented it and manages to create a truly disturbing and scary film. Anyone into horror films should definitely check it out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright. First thing is first. This is the beginning film for a great decade in horror films. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the most inspirational films ever in the horror genre. It's right up there with Deep Red from Argento and Halloween from Carpenter. Today's audience will probably laugh at this film, it's truly an old fashioned horror film. Very little blood, very little violence, it's all implied. For me this will always be one of the most disturbing horror films I have ever seen. Tobe Hooper has directed a masterpiece, his only great film. I don't really count Poltergeist for obvious reasons. The opening crawl, read by John Larroquette, sets the tone perfectly. The opening shot is hard to forget and the first time we see Leatherface, it's pretty crazy. This movie is truly low budget and one of the landmarks of modern American cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I live in a country where there is draconian censors, so having watched this film for the first time in 1982 on video, I could not watch it again as it was banned in 1983, but this year in April it was given a cinema release so I viewed it again and it has not lost its power. It is a brilliantly made film on a low budget, The grainy sun-drenched images, the close-ups of skulls and decaying, despicable images on show all add to its effect. It is a nightmare for the girl and that's where the problem was with the banning of it, the torture of her. There isn't much blood shed just the psychological terror of it all. And also it has to be said it is quite funny. At the cinema there was a lot of laughter heard, too, which is surprising how a film can make you scared and then amused in the next scene. One of the truly magnificent low-budget horror films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Off the back of Scream's box office tally, this year saw the re-release of two classic horror movies; Exorcist and Texas. Basically this means that these two films are the cream of the previous cycle in that they can live on in the cynical, satirical 90's and still scare! I've seen Texas about thirty times and each time I'm amazed by these things; 1) The sound design which incorporates strange unearthly screachings and grindings along with a benign country and western soundtrack. 2) The attention to detail with the objects in the killers house. The chicken in the cage says it all as it cackles, almost laughing at the girl before she gets hooked. 3) The sheer brutality and realism of the murder scenes. Cinematically speaking, Texas is the work of a genius who should praised on a par with Fellini, it's a pity that Tobe Hooper has not been allowed to express himself with such intelligent original films</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. It is my all-time favorite horror movie, and always will be. I still get horrifying nightmares from it. I will never forget this movie. But I think the best aspect was Sally Hardesty. She is the only real heroine I see as able to be cared about. Because you watch what she goes through to survive, and you really are glad you're not her. Because the torture she goes through is horrifying. Her screaming and the sound of the chainsaw really go together, and come back to you in the middle of the night. The first time I saw it, I think I was twelve. I begged my dad to let me rent it, and he finally said okay. So, that night, I trembled in my seat even when the narrator came on. I was so scared!! By the end, I was on the edge. That night, I could barely sleep. Nightmares plagued me the whole night, and there was the constant sound of a chainsaw. When I woke up, it was still there! But then I realized that it was only my father snoring in the other room. Oh, I was so terrified! This movie will be with me forever. And Burns's amazing performance as Sally will be the staple of heroines in horror movies. Just look for the wonderful facial expressions and insanity she shows. She has this certain survival instinct that you can't disagree with. She isn't a stupid person. Even when she runs upstairs in the Sawyer's home. She's desperately searching for help. My God, what a horrific scene!! I would recommend this movie to anyone. It will have you gripped from the beginning to the heart-attack-envoking ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tobe Hooper's TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE is a poorly made film that is miserable to look at and raw as hell. It is also quite terrifying and surprisingly bloodless considering the laughable title. People laugh when they hear you are watching THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE or scoff if you tell them you purchased it. These same people forget or have never seen this frightening low-budget cult classic that begins with one of the more striking images you will see in the movies. Two painstakingly put together corpses are seen atop a gravestone on a sunny, hot Texas morning while the radio reports of rampant grave robbing throughout the area. I'm quite sure Texas is not really like this and, contrary to most beliefs, the film is fiction, based loosely on the same mass murder case in the Pacific Northwest that inspired PSYCHO. In many ways, the two pictures are related. PSYCHO is a textbook example of how to make and create suspense in film, period. CHAINSAW MASSACRE is an example of young, inexperienced filmmaking talent tapping into the only material available to them. They are both equally scary as hell and the latter is what the kids in SCREAM are raving about.The first 2/3 of the film is grainy, atmospheric stupidity, as five young travelers (where are they going anyway) decide to stop off at two of the kid's old house. They are so dated and silly looking, you do squirm a bit. They pick up a hitch-hiker, a loony freak of a human being who we know we will see again. They run out of gas (of course), the girls are cute and big-busted (no bras) and one of these dorks is a chair-ridden invalid named Franklin. He's so annoying you can't wait till he gets the saw. Anyway, the reason to watch is for the torture and maddening experience the so-far lone survivor goes through at the hands of some sick cannibalistic, dead-skin wearing whackos. The survivor is a female (of course) with a remarkable set of lungs.All of the cliches celebrated in SCREAM and its sequel are followed through, especially the infamous "I'll be right back" line when one of the goofy teens goes off to find the continuously growing list of missing chicks and dudes. The film then makes a turn towards unforgettable horror. An engine at what seems to be a normal "residence" may be a place to get gas. Gee, let's knock and see. Enter "Leatherface", one of the most brutal killers in cinema history who squeals like a pig and looks like a demented "Sam the butcher" from the Brady Bunch. At this point, first-time viewers will either a)close their eyes until its over, B) turn it off altogether, or C) Watch one of the most horrifying sequences ever put on-screen. To describe would be uninspiring and dumb. Just witness true 'terror in the aisles' as they say in theaters.TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE works so well as a horror film because we are spared actual bloody carnage. Sure, there are macabre artifacts and meathooks but the suspense and fright lies within the eyes of the young girl and what she is going through. There is blood, but none is seen being shed. The murders are shot strategically to scare us AND make the film releasable to the general public. It is not a dream. Even Grandpa, who looks a lot like Dustin Hoffman in LITTLE BIG MAN, gets in on the action. What a nutritionist family. Horror fans are correct in declaring this a cult classic and Tobe Hooper has created a buzzing escapist film that is not necessarily entertaining. Try unsettling.RATING: As strictly horror-7 1/2 of 10 - OVERALL: 5 of 10</fullReview>

I must say that this was a real disappointment, I sat through what seemed like a never ending series of images with bad acting and a ridiculous screenplay. I thought that it started off pretty good though, right at the beginning when you see portions of a body through dim light and flashes that come across the screen. After that however, everything fell apart. The chase scenes were so awful, I ended up having to fast-forward some parts of it because it was so long and annoying. I got a headache from the constant screaming. The chase scene were the woman is running through the woods was way too long, the suspense turns into pure boredom.I don't think that this movie was frightening except that I have to admit I jumped when Leatherface made his first appearance. If I had to recommend a great classic horror movie, of course it has to "The Shining" by Stanley Kubrick. That's a pure horror movie, see that instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre wins my personal award for the best horror movie ever made. Filmed on a minute budget, Director Tobe Hopper relies on psychodramatic sound and imagery, captured with raw, documentary-like urgency. Very loosely based on Wisconsin murderer Ed Gein, the story sees five teenagers visiting Texas in order to check on a family grave after news reports of graves being desecrated. Unsuspectingly, they infringe the territory of a family of twisted cannibals, and once separated, they meet grisly deaths one by one at the hands of Leatherface, excellently acted by Gunnar Hansen. Often imitated, never equalled. As a point of note, however: There were three sequels, and if you haven't seen them, do yourself a favour; Don't bother, unless you have a high capacity for disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After hearing the reputation of this film, you have to expect some crude, low budget exercise in gore &amp; violence; and although the latter two attributes play a part, this is so much more than a mere slasher film. Hooper employs breakneck editing, so much so that the running time will fly by. Eerie sound effects (the music as the opening credits roll is particularly memorable), and images such as the gravedigger`s display with the sunrise as a backdrop, and the camera prowling around the bones in `the house` play their part as well. It`s not just technique though, the hitchhiker`s first interchange with the main characters is a triumph of tension. Don`t listen to the critics damning the explicit violence &amp; gore. They must have been watching another film. This is an extremely well made &amp; genuinely unsettling piece of work by a director who has never repeated this feat. Ignore the redundant sequels, this is the one to watch ! (9 out of 10)</fullReview>

But if you ask people what their favorite horror movie is, this better be up there. If it isn't, and they have crap like Scream 2 or Urban Legend or even the Nightmare on Elm Street's (and if they are adults, not children) then don't trust their opinion.

		<fullReview>This movie is underrated. Most people see it do not understand it and say it sucks. Or they compare it to gorefest movies. Most people believe a movie shouldn't make you try to understand it. This movie does have a lot of gore, depending which version you get. Most people rent it and most rental places have the censored version. That version cuts out a great deal so when you try to understand it you can't because someone cut those parts out. This movie shows what could really happen. Most people who say it sucked for one did not understand it, didn't really watch it completely, or are people who compare it to what it is not. What I mean by that is someone compared it to Night of the Living Dead. That movie is in a whole other area of horror. Night of the Living Dead is about the dead returning to life by a virus carried in a meteor and eating people to keep the virus alive. TCM is about a crazed cannibalistic family with a chainsaw wielding maniac. People believed there was nothing to leather face. Well they are right. They believed this is not scary. Leather face had no sense of identity so he wore people's faces, he knew nothing else than killing. That is a lot more scary than anyother movie. A living person who shows no pity, only knows how to kill and cook food. What is worst of all there is one reason behind it he wants food. I can't believe people have the nerve to compare this to The newest TCM movie. That one leather face is a perverted transvestite. The original Leather face didn't take crap from anyone who was not his family. In the new one someone told leather face to sit down and shutup what did "it" (as I refer to that thing) do? It sat down. You got some woman who just sits there, and a guy with a robotic leg controlled by a tv remote, and a idiot with a tazer. Not one person was killed by a chainsaw. Why is it called Texas "CHAINSAW" Massacre? People need to stop comparing movies to stuff it is not and just look at the movie and judge it, not what it has compared to another movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TCM is one of the best horror movies ever made, and also one of the few that is truly frightening. It's too bad that its reputation tends to precede it. Personally, although I'm a huge fan of horror, I'm not much of a fan of "slasher" movies. TCM is what I'd call horror... not necessarily "slasher." In fact, I'm consistently surprised by the LACK of explicit violence in this film. It's a testament to Hooper's directorial skill, and even more to the cinematographer's, that the fear TCM instills is more the result of technical artistry than explicitness. And of course, the outright weirdness of the story and the characters helps too. Another thing I love about TCM that rarely seems to be mentioned is the soundtrack--atmospherically speaking, it's first rate. Chilling in its minimalism. Words that describe TCM: Claustrophobic. Sweaty. Relentless. In my opinion, the best of horror breaks down something like this: TCM. Night of the Living Dead. Dawn of the Dead. Dracula (1931). Psycho. Really, what else _is_ there?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the most shocking and disturbing movies I've ever seen. It doesn't need blood or gore to become truly terrifying, but psychological madness, which pulled me to the movie like a magnet. It is amusing how a 90's horror movie, soaked with blood and gore, can't even come close to the disturbingly terrifying and excellent horror in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which was surprisingly made in 1974. It's all the more terrifying that it is inspired by a true killer named Ed Gein, who did all the horrifying things that the notorious Leatherface did. A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest horror movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie, I was expecting a typical cheezy horror/slasher movie full of sex and nudity, as most of 80s movies contained. I did not realize that this movie was made so early, and would shock me the way it did, not being able to sleep all night, which almost no other movies have done to me except The Shining. I was surprised to find absolutely no sex, which made the movie higher quality, and not even really gory at all. I consider this movie to be the greatest horror movie of all because it truly will scare the living **** out of you, disturb you, and then make you realize that something similar to this made up idea actually happened, which makes it even scarier. This movie feels like a documentary, which gives even more of the realistic feel. This film shows the darker side of man, and that mankind can be just pure evil. If you are a fan of horror movies, and did not enjoy this, put it in again, and look for the realism, and not the gore and fright factor. It doesn't really scare you with jump scenes, but with the simple fact that this is a realistic movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a brief comparison to Romero's zombie films as social satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with Romero's zombie trilogy, critical/moral condemnations of this classic horror film have focused on its degree of violent content. But what may be more unpalatable for such critics is these films' similar satirical subtext which seems to suggest that a competitive consumer based society can dehumanise people and turn them into monsters. Perhaps all films, no matter how bland or innocent they seem, have a political agenda? The debate continues: contra the (affirmative) vision of, say, "Forrest Gump", "Chainsaw" might suggest that life is more like a box of human barbeque than a box of chocolates.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to be honest and say right off the bat that I didn't get into this movie from the start. I was actually rather disappointed until I stepped back and realized what a great achievement this was. Tobe Hooper made a wonderfully real and scary classic out of this movie. I thought it would be disgusting and graphic from all I heard about it. I dreaded watching it. Then, after it was over, I was shocked that so many critics had misled me with all that too-graphic-to-be-seen crap. There's hardly any blood seen in the film which, in my opinion, is a plus. Still, the sudden and unexpected jolts the film springs on the viewers are well placed. (And get me everytime.) Anyone who likes to be scared will enjoy this low-budget masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overwhelming terror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A sadly neglected element of the terror film is the sense of identification with the victims. The tendency toward over-subjectification of the killer arguably destroyed the horror film in the 1980's, as with the disastrous Friday the 13th series. No film realized the need to present the threat of violent death as a thing to be feared rather than a thing to be relished more than The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. This is not a film to watch if you're looking for a good time. There is no real secret to the sense of identification with the victims; they are not fully-fleshed characters any more than necessary. Simply put, the threat of torture and murder presented by the family of maniacs is so overwhelming, so incompatible with subjectification with the killer, that one cannot help but sympathize with the victims (at least, if one is not totally warped). And what the lead character is put through (not to mention the questionably less fortunate other characters) is so grueling, lasts for so long, that the overall experience is one of a nightmare from which the viewer cannot escape. No other film I can think of does this so effectively; the film delves so deeply into latent fears (not only of violent death, but socially based ones as well), that it becomes as close an experience with evil as one can conceivably experience behind the safety of a television screen. Oddly enough, what sticks out in my mind is the field of sunflowers the first victims walk through on their way to the house where their worst fears are realized. Others might consider my comments hyperbole, but I was shaken by this movie long after I viewed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People tend to say they really enjoy watching this film over and over again and that its 2003 remake fails to revive the old classic. I beg to differ, in my opinion this movie is just awful, everything about it was bad, people need to start thinking with their own head, not only shout - ''wow', that's a classic, way better than new horror movies'' etc.The whole setup is bad, five incredibly annoying hipster kids you hate from minute 1, an incredibly predictable plot, irrational actions and the list goes on and on. 4 out of 5 hippies died in the lamest ways possible, it was just so boring to see all of them die the same way and still you had to sit through the rest of the movie with only 1 character remaining. The most annoying was the hippie in the wheelchair i have never hear such an obnoxious voice, that alone almost made me stop watching this. Also, the sound effects are dreadful, some tunes are not fitting the actions at all and the worst part were the overlapping sounds throughout the film.Simply bad and not worthwhile, i am disappointed about the fact that people can not write honest reviews and are so easily influenced by other peoples opinions. 2003 remake of this is way better than the original, surprisingly, but this is one of those rare cases, you will be better of watching the remake if you like the idea of this movie.</fullReview>

But we are not in 74' anymore, no sir.I have seen every sequel, prequel and remake, and I like all of them better than this. Not to sound like a douche-bag, but this is the weakest link, I think.

		<shortDescription>A certified horror classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a certified horror classic that encompasses what a horror movie should do without resorting to being cheap and exploitative. This movie contains disturbing material, creepy atmosphere, a gritty almost documentary feel, realistic characters, scary villains, and a violence quotient that is almost non-existent and yet it remains really violent.Good: The direction for this movie is excellent. It goes for a documentary feel with the grainy cinematography that lends to the realistic feel. The actors who play the group of young people especially Burns come off as real people instead of stereotypes. The villains are all crazy, intimidating, and funny in a messed up kind of way. The setting reeks of dread and a rising tension throughout in the hot Texas sun. The movie also has the reputation of being very violent, but it shows barely any blood and that is because of the gritty aesthetic and grim situation in place makes it seem like it is more violent than usual and it impresses me how it can morph a person's viewpoint on the movie without going over the top, but only with hinting those violent acts.Overall, it is one of the best horror films ever and one of my favorites films in general. If you haven't seen it yet, then go out and watch it right now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert!!! I first saw this film when I was back in 2nd grade I caught my older sister watching it in her room and it almost made me pee my pants. I think the thing that really made me clench my teeth was the thought about him sticking the girl's spine straight on that meat hook. It was so awesome that I had a nightmare that very night about him chopping through my front door and walking around in my house. I understand that this film was really inspirational with the idea of having a killer wear a mask even before Michael Myers was around. It was truly a classic slasher and the camera they used only added to how awesome it truly was to see. I wonder how audiences reacted in the theaters in the 70s I mean I think I probably would of thought this film was snuff. The characters are believable and the killer seems realistic enough. I give it a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's Aug 18, 1973. Sally Hardesty (Marilyn Burns), her handicap brother Franklin, her boyfriend Jerry, Kirk and Pam drive their van to visit her grandfather's grave which had been desecrated. They pass through the horrible smell of the slaughterhouse. They pick up a creepy disturbed hitchhiker who slices open his hand. He acts up cutting Franklin and they kick him out. He smears his blood on the van. At the gas stop, they're told that the tanks are empty. Franklin wants to see the old family house but the guy warns against it. They find the old abandoned family mansion but they are taken by the cannibalistic family with the chainsaw welding Leatherface.This along with 'Night of the Living Dead' bring in a new grotesque dynamism to the horror genre. The hitchhiker is crazy weird. The movie is bloody and violent. It's known for the low camera angles pointing up at the girls' behind. The acting is functional considering the amateurs involved. Franklin does need to be played by a better actor. Leatherface is an amazing horror killer. This is more compelling and generally better than one would expect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Texas Chainsaw Massacre 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most weirdly artistic horror film I have seen has got to be the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Everything is just a little bit different than the norm here, camera-work, acting and casting. This unique style turned out to be a home-run in the theaters and is widely known as one of the top horror films out there. Texas Chainsaw Massacre provides a couple of the most memorable scenes in horror for at least myself when Leatherface is first introduced into the plot. The first two consecutive death scenes were pretty scary when I first saw the movie when I was a kid. If you don't know what I'm talking about, the scenes involve a hammer, slamming door and a meat hook. Can't forget how classic the dinner scene is too. I do have a huge gripe though with Texas Chainsaw being the extremely annoying character of Franklin. There is no reason for a filmmaker to create a character that unlikable, to the point as a viewer of me clapping when he faces his demise. All the other characters were great however, especially the family of psychos. The family really portrayed the part of crazy lunatics to the next level. Those actors made me wonder if they were actually that crazy in real life. Texas Chainsaw will continue to be a timeless classic that will be looked at as a contributor to different transitions in horror cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still as raw as freshly packed steak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this film probably a hundred times, but just got back from seeing it on the big screen for the first time, and I was gobsmacked by how effective and absolutely ghastly it really is. I'm not sure if I forgot, or if seeing it on a restored 4K print was just that overwhelming, but regardless, the experience reinforced my belief that it is quite possibly the greatest horror film ever made, and without a doubt the greatest American horror film of all time. We all know the story: a group of hippieish young people are traveling through Texas back country to visit old family property. Meanwhile, a string of grave robberies and desecrations are occurring in the locale. The innocents meet with the perpetrators of the crimes, and utter madness breaks loose.Tobe Hooper will never outlive the reputation of this film; nothing he has made before or since has come close to the level of mastery here. The tension in "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" lies in a lot of places, but one of them is in the space between Hooper's precise attention to detail and the borderline guerrilla filmmaking technique that the film employs. Having not seen the film in its entirety in several years now, I always seemed to remember it as an exercise in dread as opposed to one in serious, skilled filmmaking, but I was completely wrong? it's both to the tenth degree. It is a gritty and raw film that is very much visually unpolished on a surface level, but it's also gorgeously shot and rich in subtext. Every zoom, every pan, and every angle is precise and calculated? the purpose is primarily to unsettle or abhor us, but also to make us feel the desolation of the landscape and the helplessness of the surroundings. Deliberate shots of the hot Texas sun and the glowing moon work in correspondence with the film's astrological and premonitory warnings, as well as its ever-mounting sense of dread that spills over into complete deprivation in the last act.The realness of the performances also really intensifies the proceedings. The characters and actors who embody them look and feel like relatively normal college kids? not ones who are up to no good, either? remember, this film predates the slasher as we know it (although it is integral to the construction of that prototype)? but just normal kids out for a drive on a languid summer afternoon. Marilyn Burns' tormented performance is unrestrained and completely real? her screams, tears, and battle wounds are unforgettable, and even Paul Partain's hokey take on the anxious and annoying disabled brother feels authentic. The only rivalry comes from the film's antagonists; the backwoods clan of father, sons, and the inexplicably zombified grandpa who turn humans into food and furniture, and exude levels of debauchery and lunacy rarely captured on film. Their family affairs are at times darkly humorous, but the film never loses its seriousness to this. It still feels like a funeral march from beginning to end."The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is one to be experienced to be believed; it really is a sensory experience (or rather, an assault on the senses). It's gorgeous and it's hideous, and everything from the calculated cinematography and natural performances to the orchestra of horrific sounds, screams, and buzzing chainsaws make it one of the most savage and robust offerings of the genre. It's a film that is still scarier than anything that has come out of American cinema in decades, and, just as it will outlive Hooper, it will outlive all of its sequels, remakes, and imitators, because it's just that darned good. While watching it on the big screen, my twenty year old friend who accompanied me was gripping my hand throughout half of the film, and almost jumped out of her seat twice. While timeless classics tend to be few and far between for genre films such as these, "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is one of a diminutive minority that has not lost an ounce of its vitality after four decades. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a masterpiece!!! As a avid horror fan, I can easily say this is one of the best horror films ever made. Everything from the opening narration and the first image we see in the movie to the brilliant unexpected ending, this movie is a horror gem.We follow Sally, her 'invalid brother Franklin', and their three friends as they go on a road trip through Texas. After picking up a crazy hitch-hiker and ditching him, they finally come across their grandpa's old farm. There, we are introduced to Leatherface and his cannibalistic family.Leatherface is the chainsaw wielding psycho that has changed the horror genre for the last 40 years. His iconic chainsaw and human skin mask has terrified audiences for decades. Gunner Hansen's portrayal of the ultimate villain has impacted the slasher and horror genre for so long and thanks to the many audiences who have sat through his terror and admired his performance.This movie has spawned many sequels and remakes, none of which have matched the intensity and pure genius of the original Tobe Hooper masterpiece.Overall I would recommend this movie for any horror fanatic who can accept that it was made in the 70s and isn't really that scary by today's standards. Fantastic and highly recommended 10/10!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Screw Blair Witch and Paranormal Activity! This is Real Horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is one of the most important films in the genre. It was one of the first slasher films ever made and it created a lot of clichés within that sub-genre such as the killer wearing a mask and teenagers being the prime victims. But other than how groundbreaking it was, is it still a good movie? Let's take a look and find out!Firstly, the story. The story here is very simple. It's about a group of teenagers who travel to Texas in a roadtrip to visit their grandpa's old house until... surprise! They all get murdered one by one by a family of serial killers! While it's certainly not a plot to brag about, it's the way it's told that makes it so memorable.The film starts with a screen of text scrolling down with a stock narrator reading it to you that that what you are about to watch is real. In reality, this film is only loosely based off real-life serial killer, Ed Gein but it's an effective way to open the movie because it makes you believe that this COULD be real.The rest of the film has this gritty, grimy look to it that makes it look like a documentary. Unlike most big-budget horror movies where all the dismembered body parts are all bloody and grotesque, they instead have this old, rusty look to them that looks like they've been sitting here for ages and to quote Mark Borchardt, it reminds you of something you see in science class. It actually works much better than if they were all bloody and grotesque because again, they feel real.The sets aren't super dark and creepy looking like the remake. Instead, the lighting is very natural with a realistic amount of light and darkness in each scene. Technically, this is cheap but stylistically, it adds a sense of reality to the film. The acting in this film is very believable. While the teenagers mostly lack personality and are pretty disposable, you believe what they are going through because they aren't the stereotypical teens who smoke weed and have sex every night. They are just normal people who are on a roadtrip. They also aren't super colorful either. In most slasher films, you could easily identify who's the responsible one, the funny one, the douchebag one, the chatty one etc but here, like real people, their personalities are very down to earth. And because of this, you believe that these are real people trapped in a real situation.But the showstealers here are the serial killers and boy, are they terrifying! They are possibly the most accurate depiction of serial killers on film. They are despicable, ugly men who make irrational decisions. They aren't these super geniuses who are always ahead of the hero like Hannibal Lecter, they are just fwcked up people!So with these brilliant stylistic decisions, comes a grisly, terrifying film that perfectly captures the experience of being hunted down by serial killers in deserted Texas. I only recommend seeing it if you are up for some sick sh!t.</fullReview>

Partain), along with three other friends, travel to their hometown in Austin, Texas to see if the graves of their deceased relatives have been disturbed after a series of grisly grave robberies. What they don't know is that a family of cannibalistic murderers is lurking about waiting for fresh meat. One of these demented cannibals is a chainsaw wielding psychopath named Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen), who wears a mask made of human skin!One of the most brilliant films I have ever seen, horror or otherwise. It's perfect in every way. The atmosphere, the tone, the grittiness, and just about every other aspect add to why it's so effective. Flawless film making. What can I say about this movie that hasn't been said countless times before? Aside from being one of the most influential horror films ever made and introducing one of the most iconic villains in movie history, everything here is done extremely well. You can tell that director Tobe Hooper and the others had their stuff well researched and knew what they were doing. The effect this movie had on people when it first came out has yet to be outdone. It feels like a real crime caught on film and the amateurish way it was shot further works to its advantage.When I first watched this film I felt like I was actually there and could feel the pain and misery Sally was going through. Add to that the psychological ride her character endures and how realistically she reacts to what is happening around her. The fear factor is communicated so perfectly in the final twenty minutes. A lot of the actual horror is suggested and you really have to use your imagination, which ups the disturbing factor. Unfortunately most of this generation lacks said imagination and needs everything to be spelled out in front of them and spoon fed, like in the terrible remake which upped the gore and action but completely lacked substance. Nothing will ever come close to this film, which is perfect in every way!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first movie to rattle my bones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Between a mix of Tobe Hooper's raw filmmaking style, and my ability to empathize fairly well, I was absolutely shaken when I first saw The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It's the reason why horror filmmakers are perpetually fascinated by that same recurring plot of "murderous cannibal family lives in the woods and kills people off who wander into their home". It's one of the reasons I love horror films in general.There's something never right even from the very start of TCM, as we get the cringe-worthy sound accompanying the camera flashes while viewing macabre images. Then of course it kicks up a notch after the gang we're going on a trip with along the Texas highway picks up a hitchhiker who turns out to be far beyond stable. Hooper works a lot of suspense, and an air of dread before finally letting Leatherface loose for the first time. I remember first watching this when I was 12 years old (I was only born in 1985, so it would have been around '97 somewhere), surely not supposed to be according to my parents, and when Leatherface first blows through that door, attacking his unsuspecting victim, I was absolutely terrified. Even 20 years or so after first scaring audiences in the mid-seventies, it was still working its magical horror on people. Today, I can still throw it on and be shocked when first meeting Grandpa; the scene where they try to get him to take some of her blood is at once horrifying, and also darkly comic. After all the years of desensitizing myself with horror of all kinds, I can still find a creepy thrill from TCM. I put myself in the shoes of these people- imagine encountering something like Leatherface. You'd be petrified. The whole family are disturbing characters in their own right, and they bring some black comedy to such a wild horror film. Hooper's raw way of filming TCM brought a whole new element to the idea of horror, and people for years to come (and still continuing on into the foreseeable future) would try emulating its feel, but nothing can ever top it for the gritty terror it induces.You can pretend all you want, but if Leatherface burst out from some shut-up door in an old house where you were looking around, you'd not only be terrified, you would most likely die. Isn't that terrifying enough? Hooper didn't have to add much to make this terrifying for me except the script itself, and the performances that came out of it. I feel a lot of it, if not all, was very natural, and very much how I would imagine people might really react.All in all, this movie gets a 10. Hands down. One of the best, and continually most frightening horror films I have yet to see. It always makes me wonder when I am deep in the woods camping somewhere, or hiking, if there really may be people out there living in a big creepy house, killing whoever they can manage. Any film that lingers in your mind, making you wonder the impossible is a solid film to me.</fullReview>

Although I have no issue with gory movies, I do prefer that they have a story.Amusingly enough, I saw this movie on a first date. That evening consisted of "Tank Girl," "Day of the Dead," and "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre." I liked the guy enough that I was willing to watch his movie, even though I was adamant I wouldn't like it. I am glad I did watch it, because I had been denying myself the viewing of an absolutely brilliant horror film.There are definitely misconceptions surrounding this movie. Like "Psycho" and other horror films, parts of this movie are taken from the life of Ed Gein. However, these parts are small and mostly insignificant. The scene in the house will all the bones lying around is really the only thing that comes from this story. Gein was also not a serial killer, as he only murdered two people and was more notorious as a grave robber. And he definitely never cut people up with chain saws.One of the things that shocked me was the lack of blood and gore in this movie. It did, however, have something in common with "Psycho." The camera work definitely gives the impression of gore and it is easy to walk away from this movie assuming that there was a lot more blood and guts than there actually was. The horror comes from so many places that actual gore is not necessary. The victims are less expectant than most horror victims and that in itself is disturbing. But Sally's approximately 20 minutes straight horror and scream fest are more unsettling than any amount of blood and violence could ever be. It takes you deeply into the horror she went through and by the time she is in the back of that pickup truck, yelling at Leatherface, you know you have felt it. The silent way the movie ends is reflective of what you must be feeling if this is the first time you have ever seen this movie.If you have avoided seeing this movie for any reason but like horror, watch it. Two movies defined 1970's horror: "The Exorcist" and "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre." There is little gore in this movie, because it will hit you on a psychological level that no amount of blood and guts can equal. An absolutely amazing and brilliant movie and well worth you time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is this so well rated?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I stumbled upon this film, I was very excited to see a horror movie, which has actually gotten some great reviews. Most of the other well rated "horror" film have concentrated on the plot (like "The Exorcist" and "Psycho") and therefore I hoped to find at least a great story and not so much the scares, since I know, that most of the horror movies from the previous century can't compete with the jumps, that the ones made today are full of.Unfortunately, there was nothing, what I was hoping to find. The story is about a commonly dumb group of teenagers, who bravely wander around and find themselves in trouble. And that's about it. The movie only shows one side of the story, which makes the plot poor and the only side that is shown is executed far from expectations. Only one of the 5 teenagers actually has a noticeable character, but for the others a simple question will be stuck in the observer's head: "Why?".I can't say, that it was all bad. The beginning of the story is actually well created and it sets the viewer in the wished mood. Sadly, the warm- up for me at least was completely unnecessary. I became more and more numb as the movie progressed and not once was I scared nor on the edge of my seat.After I had seen the movie I was confused. This movie is well rated, but why? I have read other reviews and people keep saying, that this movie is scary. I have to disagree. Because of the poor editing, I had the desire to laugh at the scary bits not scream.So don't get confused by the rating. This movie has almost no storyline, nor is it any scary. I'm not saying don't watch the movie. I'm just saying have low-expectations and the movie might turn out to be watchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is why horror movies are great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, let me start of with saying that this low budget old movie, is one of the best horror movies ever. And it was very scary when i saw it many years ago, and its still freaking scary. And this film is based on a true story, story of Ed Gein. And the other Texas Chainsaw Massacre films doesn't compare to this great masterpiece. And Tobe Hooper did an excellent job on this film. And it was good it had these nobody actors, then it seemed more realistic and scary. The setting in the film was good, it all seemed so real. This should be in the museum of the greatest horror films ever. I advice every horror fan to watch it. I rate this movie 10/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marilyn Burns and Gunnar Hansen star in Tobe Hooper's 1974 horror film. A group of teens become hunted by a killer and his psychotic, cannibalistic family. In the summer of 1973, Sally (Burns) and her friends travel through Texas to visit an old friend's house. On the way, they pick up a crazy hitchhiker and then kick him out of their van. After visiting their friend's house, they stumble onto an old house down the road and decide to have a look. They become butchered one at a time by chainsaw-wielding killer, Leatherface (Hansen) and soon Sally becomes the sole survivor who meets his psychotic family of cannibals. She endures their torture and fights for her life to escape the nightmare. Leatherface is one of the creepiest movie killers and Gunnar is great in the role. I recommend this good slasher/horror flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Texas Chainsaw Massacre follows a few teens you don't care about, (why should you care about them, what is this Scream?) On a clichéd road trip in which they pick up a creepy hitchhiker who cuts himself and laughs. And they stop at a creepy house and decide to stay there.Of course, Leatherface attacks them, one by one, slowly stalking his pray, like a damn living zombie.At one point, the girl he's chasing runs into the house and runs upstairs instead of across the house to the back door. I'd like to meet someone that stupid. This movie is like the definition of the movies the Scream franchise makes fun of.I mean, it has it's moments, and those are the creepy ones, the ones toward the end. Like you almost want to throw up it's so creepy. And that is good.When it's good, it's creepy. When it's bad, it's clichéd and stupid.</fullReview>

For decades I didn't watch The Sound of Music because I assumed it would be formulaic, exploitative - and in its own way trashy. I've now at last realised: nothing becomes a classic unless its very very good. What makes any film very good? - talented professionals in all departments really caring what they are doing and giving it their best shot. TCSM is inventive but every detail is intentional. It seems to have been made with immense care - it is in its way an art movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Horror Film Masterpiece ! Defines exactly what a great horror film should be !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the time the Texas Chainsaw Massacre had been released, horror films had come along way already. From the eerie horror films of the silent genre, to the black and white chillers of the 1930s and 1940s, horror films have changed a lot! In silent days horror monsters were usually creepy almost regular people (examples: The Man Who Could Not Laugh and The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari) then progressed into Nosferatu who probably took on the most creepiest look of Bram Stoker's Dracula. The 1930s then brought us to more traditional horror stories based off of novels as well as almost fantasy horror films like Edgar G. Wallace's King Kong. By the time of the 50s and 60s horror had become more famous on t.v series such as Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone and The Alfred Hitchcock Theatre. By the early 70s horror films took a huge dramatic turn. Probably first starting with The Exorcist. Then The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. These two films came out of nowhere and did not resemble anything else at the time. It was like BAM! And these two films came without their own evolution process. While The Exorcist is still a great horror film Texas Chainsaw takes on its own type of genre. I have seen this film dozens of times and each time I see it I notice something new or hear something new. I also pay more attention to its unique film making style (brought to you by Tobe Hooper.) Texas Chainsaw was only made by a small independent film company with completely unknown actors and actresses. The story was new and fresh and so was the film making for this landmark piece of cinema. I honestly cannot get over how different this film making is from every other horror film I've seen. It heavily takes in the horror genre without any clichés and truly defines how horror films should be. Even though this film is designed not to make you jump or gross you out, it carries intenseness with each passing scene. The guy at the gas station washing the windows is scary alone. The film can be scary and funny, but it carries a certain intensity that know other horror film that I know of takes on. Most regular horror films I watch usually have scenes leading up to climatic events that usually become scary all of the sudden, while Chainsaw on the other hand is scary just watching these kids have a conversation with a deranged hitchhiker who then goes on to cut his hand and catch a photo on fire! This is probably the last best full-length horror film next to Jaws. Now I know by saying that I get all the Jason and Freddie fans mad, so to make clear those films do have the place but are also the off set of another film that follows the same framework. Yep, you guessed it John Carpenter's Halloween set the slasher-jumping genre off and every horror film up to date has been designed like that and targeted towards the teenage audience only. Halloween is a great film and did also create another evolution of films, but by today I think this evolution needs to die. LIke so many other horror films Texas Chainsaw has taken on the burden of carrying its share of four billion sequels that just get worse and worse and worse until blowing this creation up into a remake followed with other sequels that never captured the essence or style of the first but just followed up on the current style of horror films. Part 2 is okay. It seems to me more of a parody and a lot of silly stuff happens with mindless gore and needless violence. I recommend this film to be on your top 10 list of films to see before you die, or before Leatherface gets you!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: Bizarre, Disturbing, Terrifying, Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tobe Hooper is one of the most respected directors of the horror genre. He has created many classics, including "Poltergeist," and the hip slasher/monster movie "The Funhouse." But Hooper began his career with a low-budget film that many had called gruesome, obscene, and unwatchable. "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" may not be the most fun movie to watch, but it most certainly is a classic horror film.The plot is extremely simple. Five teens are traveling through Texas. The teens are Sally Hardesty, her wheelchair-bound bro Franklin, Kirk, Pam and Jerry. After picking up one wacko hitchhiker, it's pretty clear that the worst is yet to come for Sally and her friends. After their van runs out of gas, Kirk and Pam go looking for help and stumble upon a backwoods house. They don't come back, so Kirk goes looking for them. Kirk doesn't come back either. Now Sally and Franklin are left all alone with no sign of help. Tonight, Sally will be put through hell and back as she is brutally terrorized by a depraved group of cannibals, led by the iconic Leatherface, who uses a chainsaw to kill his victims.Tobe Hooper's non-stop fright-fest was released in a time where horror directors were considered insane. Films like "The Last House on the Left" and "The Hills Have Eyes" were two of those kind. But "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is where it was done best. So, what makes TCM a piece of essential horror? First off, the movie is extremely eerie and filled with tension and scares. It felt like you were watching some twisted documentary on some of the most brutal crimes in history. "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is known for being the goriest movie of its kind. That is not all true. While the movie sure has its violent moments, a lot of the kills are off-screen, which just makes it scarier.Second of all, the acting feels so incredibly real. Marilyn Burns, Sally, was put through so much torture with TCM. All that running and getting hurt. I feel sorry for her just thinking about it. The rest of the teens are also very good. But the movie's demented clan of butchers are pretty damn believable. I thought they were actual criminals. You also gotta give props to Gunnar Hansen and Edwin Neal as Leatherface and The Hitchhiker. They are very good actors.Third of all, the movie's main villain, Leatherface, is so enormously scary. But he also is interesting to watch when he's not killing. Leatherface is not very intelligent, and he is pretty shocked when Sally and company appear at his house. But when he's on the job, he's a brilliant villain. The fact that this guy ran after his victims and you couldn't get away from him makes him creepy."The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" will always be the most gruesome and claustrophobic horror film of the 70s. This one isn't for the faint of heart and if you get nightmares easily, TCM's definitely not for you. You'll feel like taking a shower after this movie. It's that effective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is powerful and the images bold. I studied fine art and oil painting. This film almost looks like an oil painting with it's texture and grittiness. I think PART of the interest is the set design. It looks amazingly real because it was. The bones on the set were real-only 10 plastic bones used I believe. There is a realism here that no one has ever been able to recreate. You can almost smell the decay and rot. Couldn't a person actually smell this house before seeing it? Possibly. The acting is slightly over the top but very realistic at the same time. The lighting perfect. What makes this film such a favorite? The realism, the boldness, the editing, the look, the characters. All of it. A chilling film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing, sickening, chilling and uncomfortably amoral - a cornerstone of the slasher genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often more terrifying than individual efforts of the slasher film, a subgenre permeating Hollywood horror films since the 1970s, is envisioning the motivation or inspiration which led the filmmakers in question to fathom such gruesome spectacles. Such is without question the case with director Tobe Hooper, and the infamous story encircling his legendary call to fame. Hooper cites his inspiration as a combination of planning a film involving wilderness and isolation, and an incident when, attempting to determine a way through a crowd of people in a crowded department store, spotting a chain saw. This combination of concise efficiency and gruesomely twisted yet darkly humorous inspiration ably serve as metaphoric for Hooper's ensuing film, with content as bold, striking, no nonsense and macabre as its title: The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Now recognised as a cornerstone in the horror genre, Hooper's film proves a remarkable exercise in visceral, abrasive horror as much for its restraint as for its gruesome excesses. Effectively setting the mould for all future slasher films (collection of attractive, carefree teenagers, isolated location, creepy locals and a continuous ominous sense of foreboding), for a film associated with so much bloody death and dismemberment, the film is made all the more astonishing upon the realisation of how minimal the on-screen gore actually is. And yet its inclusion is not even necessary, as Hooper mines traumatic, emotional horror with unsettling canniness, allowing the audiences' minds to fill in the blanks while providing just enough gruesome sounds to drive the point sickeningly home. However, this notion of "the point" is arguably what makes The Texas Chain Saw Massacre the most frightening: the fact that for all intents and purposes, there does not appear to be one. The film goes about its grotesque business in an alarmingly efficient and unashamedly amoral fashion, with no real social commentary (there is a fleeting reference to unemployment leading to the grisly happenings, as well as the recurring slaughterhouse motif and earlier mention of animal cruelty being enough to put almost any viewer off meat) or attempt to justify the incredible violence presented. Instead, Hooper's film attempts to evoke sadistic pleasure in forcing the viewer to look at the grotesque or disturbing - the film's opening, cutting from shots of dismembered corpses strung up on public monuments to a drawn out close up of a dead armadillo, only serving to foreshadow the incredibly distasteful collection of characters and vicious events to come. Rather than trying to infuse his film with morality, Hooper seems more interested in questioning the morality of the viewer watching, exploring why audiences would choose to take in such a film, and to what effect. And far more unsettling than Hooper's collection of unsavoury individuals and gruesome violence is the reversal of the appraisal of them back at the viewer, begging the question that if what happens in the film is so distasteful, what does makes the viewer who watches it for leisure?But disregarding such self-reflexive questions of spectator morality, Hooper's film firmly earns its grisly reputation, proving a masterpiece in sight and sound, the strikingly jarring, viciously innovative cinematography and editing crafting a horrifying immediacy to the macabre events. With scenes often shot out of focus, from a distance or from uncomfortably close angles (at one point alternating between three increasingly zoomed in close-ups on an eye) the decidedly anti-Hollywood veneer to Hooper's film provides a terrifyingly credible sense of being present, or closely observing the massacre taking place. However, arguably even more effective is the chillingly different musical score, a cacophonous collection of mechanical clanging and screeching designed to replicate the sounds cows would hear within a slaughterhouse, intensifying the terror to almost unbearable levels. Such astounding technical work is what prevents the film from ever appearing dated and keeps it grounded during its occasional comic moments, some intentional, some not (there is a strangely humorous undertone to the cumbersome Leatherface and his incessantly screaming prey), assuring that despite the frequent potential of losing the viewer, Hooper is always capable of wrenching new screams or shudders from them. The cast of mostly unprofessional actors are unanimously impressive, giving unpolished, naturalistic performances which make the grim spectacle all the more real. Despite a lack of character, Marilyn Burns energetically delivers on the screaming terror front, her all consuming horror coming across as frighteningly genuine. Paul A. Partain delivers occasional comic relief as well as moments of chilling foreshadowing as Burns' knife obsessed wheelchair bound brother, and Edwin Neal gives a disturbingly vivid and credible performance as an unhinged, psychopathic hitchhiker. Finally, Gunnar Hansen essays the now timeless Leatherface killer with eerie precision, adding an intriguing level of odd pathos and occasional humour behind his twisted, foreboding and flat out terrifying physical exterior.Just as eerily unsettling as it is flat out terrifying, Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre never goes for easy scares, instead adhering to a naturalistic, vivid sense of sickening terror making it all the more memorable and gripping. Untainted by decades of inferior knockoffs, barely slowed down by the occasional unintentionally comic or clunky moment, and its fright factor boosted by an uncomfortably irreverent sense of amorality, the film easily merits its reputation as a gruesome classic of the slasher horror genre - just trying shaking it out of your head afterwards. -8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the afternoon of August 18th 1973, Five college students (William Vail, Marylin Burns, Allen Dazinger, Paul A. Partain, Teri McMinn) ran out of gas while traveling. They go to a farmhouse where they need help, instead they find weird stuff like furniture made out of human skeletons and human remains as it freaks them out. They become prey for a family of cannibals lead by a crazed Gas-station owner (Jim Siedow) and a maniac named Leatherface (Gunnar Hanson) who turns their day and night into a nightmare of unspeakable terror.One of the most influential and greatest horror movies ever made! Tobe Hooper with co-writer Kim Henkel has created an unbelievably scary and powerful motion picture that could change the horror genre forever. It shocked and amazed audiences since 1974 and still has that power to shock, the film is influenced by the murders of Ed Gein and Ted Bundy as the film contains that documentary-esquire feel to it. The film was well received and became one of Horror cinema's most beloved movies as it spawned three sequels, a remake and a prequel plus some knock-offs in it's wake but nothing beats the 1974 masterpiece.A true must see for horror buffs!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Texas chainsaw massacre, they took my baby away from me?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-The film, which you are about to see, is an account of the tragedy, which befell a group of five youths, in particular Sally Hardesty and her invalid brother, Franklin. It is all the more tragic in that they were young. But, had they lived very, very long lives, they could not have expected nor would they have wished to see as much of the mad and macabre as they were to see that day. For them an idyllic summer afternoon drive became a nightmare. The events of that day were to lead to the discovery of one of the most bizarre crimes in the annals of American history, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre-This is a true horror classic, a true must-see film and, definitely, a true great one. You are in the shoes of Sally (Marilyn Burns), Franklin (Paul A. Partain), Jerry (Allen Danzinger), Kirk (William Vail) and Pam (Teri McMinn) and you feel the danger since the beginning thanks to that problem with the corpses. And how not feel that the main characters are in danger since they picked up a very strange guy with blood in his face (Edwin Neal, kind of overacting in a very good way) and who likes to use the penknife, even against himself. But also Hooper shows us the relation between these young persons, focusing in Sally and her brother Franklin's issue (he uses a wheelchair). Franklin seems to be out of the "group" and also he feels that he is been nuisance for his sister so thanks to all of this we feel kind of more worry about this character when they finally arrive to his grandpa's old house yet with Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) nobody is secure and as soon this maniac uses his chainsaw Sally and Franklin will be alone. In think in the end of the film and even knowing the final of Sally, I feel that Franklin was kind of lucky, of course he is lucky just when we compare his -fast- meeting with Leatherface with Sally's meeting with the entire family, that is definitely the "difficult" part of the film. The shots are terrific and the eyes of Sally (magnificent scene) reflect everything of this sick family that is really disturbing but also has like the regular things of a family, like the "kids" feeling respect for their grandfather and here they are please to please him with another victim yet and terrific for Sally, she is not just another victim and soon her desperation and fear tears will be tears of happiness.This is a great film and a landmark, with an enormous influence (even The Ramones made that song "Chainsaw", which part of its lyrics are in my title, after Joey saw this film) and a great and memorable villain (inspired by Ed Gein) so in few words this is low-budget film-making at its finest, one of my favourite and most recognized horror films ever and even I haven't seen the entire filmography of Tobe Hooper I think this is his masterpiece. So is almost unnecessary to say but I'm going to say it: if you haven't seen it, well go and get its DVD right now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot of The Texas Chainsaw massacre is actually quite simple ? A group of young people are traveling across Texas to visit a family grave-site before making their way to a concert. They run into a hitch-hiker and decide to give him a lift. Bad idea! It no time at all, they realize how crazy their new passenger is. But he's nothing compared with the rest of his family that our band of travelers is soon to encounter. They'll have to fight to stay alive or they'll become victims of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.If you were to ask me about what makes The Texas Chainsaw Massacre a horror classic and such a well remembered film, my answer would be even simpler than the movie's plot. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has an intensity that few (if any) horror movies can match. In a nutshell, that's all there is to it. The intensity comes from the raw, gritty, brutal feel of the movie that, once the family is introduced, does not let up for a moment during the second half of the movie. Another contributing factor to the film's visceral edge is its realism. From the acting to the sets to the lighting, it all has a realistic, almost documentary feel to it as if the horrifying events on screen were actually happening. It is a gut-wrenching experience that never fails to leave me feeling drained. And isn't that the intent of a movie like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre? As far as I'm concerned, this is what horror is all about.I would be remiss if I wrote something on The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and didn't mention Marilyn Burns. Her performance is quite simply amazing. Some argue that all she does in the second half of the movie is scream. Well, have you ever tried to do that? Have you ever tried to look terrified beyond all imagination for that length of time? Her only defense mechanism against the terror she faced was to scream and Burns does that to perfection. I have no difficulty at all in proclaiming it one of the ten best performances by a female in a horror movie. She's just that good.I try to restrict the 10/10 ratings I give out to those movies that I consider to be the best of the best. I want it to mean something. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the movies I'm quite comfortable in rating a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no other movie in the horror genre that comes close to the original TX Chainsaw Massacre. This movie even 30 years later has all of the components of a great horror movie. This movie contains no ghosts, spirits, Devil or "monster" or unexplainable entity. What this movie has is a 100% crazy psycho covered with a grotesque leather face who is hacking young adults to bits with a chainsaw. Classic! Freddy Kruger can not touch Leather Face, because he talks so much he starts to sound like a burnt up stand up comedian with all of his corny one liners. Jason and Micahel Myers from Halloween don't talk, but they aren't scary to look at either, the kid next door with a hockey mask on? Leather Face is just plain old scary to look at, whether or not he is yielding his chainsaw. His weirdo family also adds to the scariness of this movie. It's like those people had no idea that they were crazy as all outdoors. If there is even one New School horror fan out there that saw the remake of this without seeing the original, do yourself a favor and see the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre and I dare you to even think about picking up a hitchhiker afterwords.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the BEST</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best INDEPENDENT horror films of all time. Based on guerrilla film-making, intense performance, and subject matter. And all with very little blood and guts. The real selling point is that it is shot so stripped down and amateurish and performed by very few seasoned actors (mostly local college students). These factors give it a documentary-like feel which really sells the terror. And keep in mind, it's the early seventies: before Friday the 13th, before halloween, before freddy, before scream, I know what you did last summer, jeepers creepers, and countless other knock-offs. This one sets the bar. It is a thrilling horror story, shot with very few, if any, "jump out and scare you", cheep thrills. With the possible exception of the first halloween and nightmare on elm st., all the rest are just slasher films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People come and go, and try and remake the classic film "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" even though many remakes have come out, from different directors, and many do change a lot of the original film, but still have the the classic skin, chainsaw, the crooked dark house with lurking secrets, the heavy metal screen door where unthinkable things happen, and the scared but yet evil, cruel "leather face" who seems to be the boss, goes around killing but yet soft and scared when he has done wrong and is going to get punished.Even though Texas Chainsaw is over 30 years old, it still touches us as if it just came out for the first time even though its been brought out several times (Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, 3, Next generation, also just made again in 2003) each time touches us in different ways but usually leaves the same thoughts, the buzzing chainsaw, the dark road towards the house with gleamy lights at the end, the bones and skin lampshades and chairs, the harsh grind of the large metal door when leather face takes away another one of his victims.When I watch this movie I always find myself feeling like I was there, almost like I can smell the rotting flesh, and feel the pain and terror of the poor souls in this movie.I always believe that no one can beat the original leather face (Gunnar Hanson) even though the original doesn't have much gore, and it doesn't have your typical graphics in this movie, not like most movies have now, and this movie was made on a low budget, but still has to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest horror movie in time.This movie is based off the killer, Ed Gein, who wasn't a chainsaw killer but did wear skin, specially womens skin and made every day things out of humans (lampshades, bowls, spoons, chairs) because he was one of, if not the only one, who made his mark in this world, who was deeply disturbed, and got taught that people outside his house hold was bad and devil like, and that he should never associate with women, so he grew up with no friends, never had a girlfriend or anything along them lines, but when his mum died, he turned two ways, one was he was glad because he wanted to associate with people, and killed women and raped them, but yet also killed people because he was brought up to believe everything was the devil outside of his house. So when his mum died, he tried to keep her alive by wearing womens skin, dressing up as her.This movie is probably the best because its based off a true story, and along the lines of what happened with Ed Gein</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece! What can I say more?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE is one of those masterpieces in the horror history: smartly directed and disturbing. It's pure 70s style: 16mm, a lot of zoom and a morbid atmosphere. What I like most is the lack of splatter effects: everything is done thanks to a great use of the camera and the editing. The first double-murder scene is a proof. That's one of my favourite horror sequences of all time. The story is linear, as a real horror movie should be: the most important thing is the style used. The idea of not using music, but just sound effects is great! It's very sad that Hooper has not done a movie like this again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the greatest horror film to come out of the 70's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie IS scary, this movie IS intense, that is unless it is viewed by a cynical jerk who won't admit when they are afraid . There is nothing wrong or unintentionally funny in this movie, anyone who says otherwise is an individual I have no chance of respecting. This is horror at its best in both style and intensity, if you mock this film you mock the entire genre of horror, and that results in me hating you. This is the best of the best and it shall never be matched. Its impact is eternal, it inspired the intensity of Alien and all other subtle yet intense horror films, it of course inspired a lot of horrible knock offs, sequels and remakes, but more importantly it inspired me to love fear and to love all things grotesque. This is where a new era began, only the ignorant and delusional can mock it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why do they make these movies to begin with? I never understood why anyone would pay money to see a splatter movie, but this movie had so much word-of-mouth, I thought I should try to stomach it. While it wasn't as gory as I would have expected, but it was still was sickening enough and creepy enough that I hated it. I didn't feel for the victims and I didn't care for the dark humor either. In other words, I still do not understand, and will probably never understand, why people want to see this kind of dreck.For what it's worth, the film does succeed on raising the hackles on one's neck so I suppose that makes it effective as a horror film. Maybe I'm just old-fashioned, but bloodletting by itself does not entertainment make.Now, I enjoyed the violent movies like those of Sam Peckinpah and Martin Scorsese, but I have the same problem with them at times where they prolong the bloody scenes when not entirely necessary. I suppose that is why I never had any need to see the new Mel Gibson take on the death of Jesus Christ. But, judging by reviews here on IMDb and the box office of the slice and dice brand of horror movies over the years, there is an audience out there for these autopsies on film. I'm just not one of those audience members and I never will be.I still recall the words of horror great Boris Karloff who said that "horror has been replaced by gore" and he found it rather sad - as do I. He was right then, and he is still right now - even more so.And this from someone who played a zombie Lucio Fulci's "Zombie." I'll let you in a little secret. I almost backed out of this extra part when I found out what kind of movie it was to be, but then I said to myself, "Boris started out this way," and went ahead and did it. Now I am a hero to nieces and nephews who actually like this kind of movie. What are you going to do?</fullReview>

If you love extras, the commentary is great. Very informative. I also highly recommend the new version of this film. On a scale of 1 to 5, both of these excellent scary flicks get a 5. I would love to see both versions of Chainsaw on a drive-in double bill. Check 'em out. You won't be sorry! I highly recommend the special edition DVD's for both films. They are full of cool extras and behind the scenes footage. As well as the usual trailers and commentaries. The Ed Gein documentary on the newer version is creepy to say the least.PS. I hope they don't try to remake Chainsaw 2</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Texas Chainsaw Massacre is "Terror-ific"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the most haunting, disturbing, mind-blowing movie I have ever seen.What's even more scarier about it is that it was based (very loosely) on a true story!A group of five teenagers (Sally Hardesty and her brother Franklin and company) are traveling through a deserted road in South Texas, they stop by a gas station which is unfortunately out of stock on gasoline at the moment. As they split up and look for a house that might have some fuel, they meet the cannibalistic villain: Leather-Face and terror and unfathomable fear ensues from there on out!There is nothing more disturbing about this modern horror classic than what these teens experienced during the young stage of their lives. They were hit in the skull with mallets, impaled on meathooks, hacked up with a chainsaw, stuffed alive into refrigerators, cooked up for dinner, and saw the most horrifying things, ever the would see in their entire lives! And the sadest part is: they all were only around 17 to 18 years old!!!!This is a movie that is often misunderstood and should be taken more seriously. There is absolutly nothing more tragic and horrific than what these kids went through. Sure, for the first 30 to 45 minutes of the movie, they babble about nothing, but so what? Ther're friggin' teenagers! Sure, Frankiln Hardesty may be annoying, but so what? He's a friggin' cripple! Sure, Sally's screaming during the last 30 minutes may be irratating, but so what? She's a 17 year old girl who has obviously never been laid before and is having the most horrifying experience of her life at a young age!Bottom line is: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the greatest horror classics ever made (especially for one made on a low budget), anyone who likes movies based (loosely or not) on ture events, should watch this movie NOW and know exactly what these poor teens experienced at an early stage of their lives!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My take on the Texas Screaming Girl Massacre..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Note: Overrun by spoilers*Having just watched the 2003 version of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I was compelled to rent the original to make a fair direct comparison between the two version. I had hoped that the original would offer an eerie quality oft found only in classic films such as Halloween and the like. Unclear scenes that leave much to the imagination, directors forced to use true ingenuity to compensate for low budgets - things rarely witnessed in the high tech, high-quality state filmmaking is currently in. That isn't what I saw. I saw a movie with an actor who saw fit to make a man who was merely unable to walk, and of normal intelligence 90% of the time but on occasion act as if the lack of self-mobility somehow equated to him behaving mentally retarded when upset. I saw a movie that had a scene that showed a room full of human bones, which i suppose would be terrifying to for a solitary person to fall into, but it was minutes of screaming and frantic cameras zooming in and out, and I couldn't wait for it to end... It just kept going and going. People die, and then we are left with the 1974 parallel to Jessica Biel. Once she realizes she is alone, all her friends are dead, and is running from Leatherface, you can go ahead and stop watching the movie. "Why?" you might ask? Well, because from that point forward, the film is nothing but that girl screaming at the top of her lungs.. At what point do you understand that screaming won't help you when there is nobody to hear it? At what point do you choose to fight back, or resign yourself to the fact that you will die, and just sit there or pass out? I wanted her to shut up so bad that I was angry at Leatherface and family for NOT KILLING HER SOONER. In fact, NONE of them garnered any sympathy from me whatsoever. I was glad to see them get knocked off... How can a movie be scary when you can't feel for the victims? How can you be worried or terrified for them, when you WANT them to die? Highly annoying. The whole film was annoying. It was too dark, it was too poorly acted, and it was too focused on the screaming chick and the fact that her eyes looked capable of popping out of her head.Do yourself a favor: If you have to watch one of these films, watch the new one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This horror movie is to the '70s what "Psycho" and "Night of the Living Dead" were to the '60s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(***** out of *****) This exercise in insanity is an absolute mofo. Forgive my lapse in eloquence, but few other words capture the frantic anxiety, the nail-biting terror and the pulse-pounding freakishness generated by this monumental horror classic -- it is truly a son of a bitch. It's like a roller coaster ride, on which the car flies right off the track in the last half hour, thanks mostly to the delerious editing and creepy sound effects and musical score by Hooper. The plot, as with most of these films, is pretty simple. A sister and brother, Sally and Franklin (Marilyn Burns and Paul A. Partain), take a road trip with some friends out to their old house in the country and intrude upon a family of cannibalistic ghouls who've moved in next door. Rather than politely asking them to keep off their property, Leatherface and company take matters into their own hands (with meat hooks, hammers, knives, brooms, mallots, and, of course, the titular 'saw). Burns has to be one of the most victimized (and loudest) heroines in horror movie history -- I wouldn't wish the horrific ordeals she goes through on my worst enemy. Contrary to its title and reputation, most of the blood and guts in this movie are left to the imagination. But, no expense is spared on the sadistic cruelty and unbridled lunacy portrayed by the depraved Sawyer family. Gunnar Hansen plays the incomparable, chainsaw-wielding, flesh-eating-and-wearing, occasional cross-dressing Leatherface. Some of the grotesque elements of this movie, as in Hitchcocks' "Psycho" and Alan Ormsby's "Deranged" (1973), were inspired by real-life serial killer-cannibal Ed Gein.HIGHLIGHT: Dinnertime with the Sawyer family -- Leatherface is decked out in his Sunday best, his little bro (Edwin Neal) gibbers and whimpers mockingly, Dad (Jim Siedow) is grinning and guffawing like an idiot (when he's not slapping and yelling at his rowdy sons), unexpected guests are tied to (human)arm chairs, and 100+-year-old Grandpa is more than willing to suck your bloody finger for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I dig a good (or bad) horror movie like the next person. And I'd heard from many people that the Texas Chainsaw Massacre was worth watching as a seminal flick in the horror genre. I am also willing to appreciate the fact that, while some scenes from horror movies don't stand up over time (Norman Bates at the end of psycho rushing through the door making funny faces in a wig and dress realllllly loses it after forty years), i can appreciate its value.That said, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a terrible, terrible, terrible movie. It has NO value from character development, NO plot to speak of, no plot points, NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING. Ultimately, of course, before analyzing a film, you base your feelings on your gut reaction - in my case, i have never laughed harder (well, i suppose Hercules in New York with Arnold Strong had me laughing).This movie holds up over time simply from people who were around when it came out 30 some odd years ago, and were scared. these people persist in their belief that it is actually a good movie, and it is not. Saying it is lowbudget is not an excuse. It doesnt take a budget to write a good story, an interesting story.There was not a single likable character in the film. They were all whiners, and i was rooting for their early deaths. The opening scene with the hitchhiker in the car was so fucking funny, especially when he cut open his hand and they STILL FAILED TO PULL OVER AND KICK HIM OUT was hilarious. Yeah, this guy's not a f*** up, let's keep driving and staring at him.Most of this film was just running around. I'm not sure what "mood" people are talking about as being pervasively scary. The only mood i can sense is the same mood from the blair witch project - we've got a camera and an environment that is technically creepy; let's just film around and try to wig people out.Listen - i like bad movies, but i admit they are bad movies. We all have a special place in our heart for those one star calamaties. But at least be able to say they're bad. This is A BAD MOVIE. There is NO opinion involved.</fullReview>

The story was well not much but the killings were nice and it was right to the point, this is how you should do horror not much suspense or comedy but a whole lotta pointless blood and murder going on! There wasn't enough killing though, way too much talk and the ending was way too goofy it turns into Leatherface having a goofy family and that's when it all goes downhill, I'll give it a 6 out of a 10, it's worth seeing just don't watch the sequal</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A masterpiece for director Tobe Hooper. The film deals with a cannibalistic family in the backwoods of Texas who torment people that get in their way. At the beginning of the film we meet the teenage characters, probably most importantly Sally Hardesty and her wheelchair bound brother, Franklin. As in most horror films they are warned by locals not to go to the old house because they're all nuts up there, but as in most horror films they don't listen to what the locals have to say and make their way up there. Now, it wouldn't be a horror movie if they didn't go up there and get murdered-- that's exactly what happens. We meet the backwoods family such as the oldman and the chainsaw using Leatherface. This is a great film with a horror climax, it gets very scary at times and never lets you down. There's always something happening and it's full of suspense and very realistic. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes the horror genre, this is a film that is meant to be taken seriously and that's the thought that you should have when you go into watch it. My favorite scene in the whole movie is the end with the truck driver- it just seems so realistic! I give The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is undoubtedly one of the most powerful films ever made. While not as violent and gory as some made it out to be, this is still one of the sickest films known to man. In "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," the story of five traveling friends and the horrifying events that surround them is told. One by one, each young adult is slaughtered by the most brutal killer of the Sawyer family, "Leatherface." Using a sledgehammer, meat hook, and the infamous chainsaw, "Leatherface" goes right through each one of the young travelers that enters his home, and from there he hunts down the last surviving member of the group, a girl named Sally, who is able to escape his carnage for a few short minutes until a seemingly-friendly station attendant reveals himself to be a member of the Sawyer family and brings her home for dinner. That's where the film becomes down-right sick.For some meaningless facts, the film gained some inspiration from the real-life events of mass murder Edward Gein, who was also the inspiration for the character "Norman Bates" from "Psycho." "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" was also glorified by a couple of idiots in the mid-80s classic "Summer School," starring Mark Harmon, who played Theodore Bundy in made-for-television film "The Deliberate Stranger."The film is just as real as being there. "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" captures the essence of a documentary in the shape of a horror film, making a film for the ages. "Chainsaw Massacre" receives ***1/2 out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing, Intense, and Original - One of the Greatest Horror Films of all Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amongst the classic chain saw-wielding psychotics of cinema, none is more famous and dangerous than Leatherface (Jason who?). How can I call myself a horror fan (which, for the record, I don't) having seen only bits and pieces of "Texas Chain Saw Massacre", one of the most demented movies of all time? I have wanted to see "TCM" for a very long time, and the saw that split the camel's back was the film's original trailer, which I recently saw as part of the "Boogeymen" DVD collection. I was in awe of the 2 minutes of film presented in said trailer and rushed to the video store to rent this horror masterpiece. If anyone has actually read my reviews and recognizes this intro, I picked up the right box this time, and I sure am glad."Texas Chain Saw Massacre" is such a great movie because of its peculiarity. Filmed on low-quality, grainy film, there is a real feeling of being there, and seeing the twisted sights and experiencing the fear in person; most horror films (such as "TCM 3: Leatherface") are simply too polished to give this feeling (such films may be startling, but are never truly scary), which is essential to the mood. Just as essential is excellent acting on behalf of the film's resident psychopaths, Leatherface and his brother "Hitchhiker". Gunnar Hansen is unforgettable as the menacing, seemingly unstoppable, barely human (his squeals of pleasure send shivers down my spine) juggernaut that is Leatherface, but "Hitchhiker" isn't given enough credit, as he is just as imposing, perhaps even a little more so than Leatherface, since the audience can actually see his crazed look of pleasure at cutting his own hand open and (later in the film) mentally torturing Sally. Add to this a delightfully twisted script that works off of a fairly basic plot (albeit with 2 shocking twists surrounding the family that I wouldn't dare give away) of gruesome, fairly random killings that reminds us why we never go into abandoned houses in the middle of nowhere, and you have a bizarre masterpiece of horror dementia.Tobe Hooper's direction is as unique as the film he is directing. His decision on what to focus on in close-up shots (a nest of spiders or the revelation, piece by piece, that the room's crudely constructed furniture is made of bone), like the aspect of unpolished film, gives a true impression of not watching a movie but seeing through one's own eyes. This is most effective in the close-ups of Sally's terrified eyes of the infamous "dinner table scene". There is a disturbingly surreal nature to scenes such as this and the aforementioned "bone furniture" (which are some chillingly realistic props in their own right - and Hooper's direction makes it all the more horrifying when all that can be seen for a few minutes looking around a room is these props) which I have yet to see in any other film since.Another thing unique to this film is the controversy it causes that has led to it being constantly censored and banned for violence, when there isn't any gore directly presented in the film. Hooper implies most of the violence, mainly through the "bone furniture" and other disturbing props, and Leatherface's wardrobe of a butcher's apron and use of a relatively silent (but effective) butcher's mallet for most of his early killings, giving off a distinct impression of knowing what sick things this family is capable of, but not knowing which sick thing the family is doing right now. Showing more evidence of his excellent direction, Hooper cuts away at just the right moment (usually just after capture) and shows only one victim's corpse to leave one hanging with such thoughts - is the victim dead, and if so, what could possibly be in stake for his/her remains? This is why the film works on a different level than a simple horror film, and why all the other chain saw-wielding maniacs that have attempted to imitate this film have never succeeded. Yet, while working on a different level, the film also has an unrelenting pace that creates suspense on the simple level of knowing that the victims have two options - escape or death."Texas Chain Saw Massacre" does so many things right, building something truly disturbing off basic fears of survival and what lies in the middle of nowhere, all through the distinct impression of it all being a first-hand experience, rather than a film. Now I truly understand why it is a true masterpiece of low-budget film-making and horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too macabre after all..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, I finally got to see the infamous Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I got heavily disappointed.Initially, I thought this was going to be a roller coaster of the macabre..and scary (at least!). It was not. Five young vacationing kids are savagely haunted and killed by a small Texas slaughter-family. Period. The intensity and mood was created with failure. In the sense that it did not push your adrenaline over the edge. Which it should. Which supposedly was its purpose. I cannot complain TOO much of the gore though, because there were rather few sequences of blood and slashing in the movie. As a fresh breath, however, comes Gunnar Hansen as 'Leatherface'. He is an entertaining killer. More than most nutcases on the screen in modern cinema. Daniel Stern's cinematography is not the worst either. Unluckily, this is not enough to make TCM a good movie.NB: one of the best sequences in the movie, is when Leatherface is assisting Grandpa of hitting Sally in the head with a sledgehammer.(5/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find it scary that people consider this one of the most frightening movies of all time. Problems with the film:- I would be very surprised if this movie took more than a week to make. I'm guessing it took a day to write, a day to edit, a day to cast &amp; pull together favors, friends, one day of shooting, a day to score, a day to edit, and one last day to mix everything together. I realize it was low budget, but, come one! I wrote better stories in the fifth grade . ..- Overacting, melodrama to the extreme, terrible, terrible acting. The best actor and most believable was grandpa. Now I know where Friday the 13th's cast got their inspiration. These people couldn't overact if they tried.- And the writing? What is it with horror movies writing parts for all the characters as if they're mindless morons? Uninteresting, laughable characters, the leatherface family was probably the most hilarious part of the movie.- Poor cinematography. Okay, there were 3 nicely done shots. One nice morning shot, and one nice shot done with the sun slowly coming down in the sky. There might have been one more in there somewhere. Beyond that, uninteresting camera angles plagued the film.- This film should be named "Scream" since the last 20 to 30 minutes of it was one big scream by our dear friend Sally. She screamed, ran from leatherface, screamed more, screamed so much I wanted to say, "Okay, step aside leatherface, let me shut her up." I was cheered everytime Gramps hit her in the head with that hammer. While I'm talking about this, that last chase scene which should get the record for longest and most boring chase, it sucked. A chase scene could only last so long before the audience gets bored.Bad, bad, bad.... something better could be found. Like, say, Exorcist or Halloween.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading Entertainment Weekly's list of the top 25 horror movies, I had to see this movie as it was posted at number 2. After searching through video store after video store, I found the movie. After all this, I saw the movie, and I must say, I wasn't too impressed with it.Don't get me wrong, I give it props for being wholly original for its day. On the flip side, we were also forced to endure its bastard children including the Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street movies.The potential greatness of the movie was ruined by its script (or lack thereof). It's a movie in which nothing really happens. We're given a great set-up of grave robbers making sculptures out of rotting corpses in the cemetary. We're given the five kids driving through (a staple of many slasher movies to come), and a great set of locals straight out of Deliverance. You think: What could go wrong?Well, here's what goes wrong. The "scary killer" is not scary. He looks and acts like a retarded, middle-aged woman with a chain saw. It's about as frightening as a 100 ft Stay Puft Marshmellow Man traversing through Manhattan.The next problem is that there is no middle. Four out of the five kids get killed within fifteen minutes of each other. At first I thought, "well maybe this is good because all other slasher-fests drag out all of the killings." But at least, the kids demises have an entertainment value. Not here. It happens too quickly to invoke any fear. This coupled with the ridiculousness of Leatherface bolsters the stupidity.Third. The grandfather who looks as if he should, by all rights, be long dead and apparently lives off of the blood of human victims. Frightening? No. Funny? No. Stupid? Ah, yes. This cheap, Troma-esque addition makes the film lose credibility. I could believe that a family of rednecks are killing people just to eat them, just as I could believe Mrs. Vorhees wants revenge on the camp where her son died. This old guy is the resurrection of the dead that kills many horror franchises.Finally, there is no end to the movie (Potential SPOILER in case you really care). Yes, our heroine (I guess) finally escapes. But then what? The movie ends with Leatherface flipping out with his chainsaw. That's it! Does she call the police? What happens to the redneck family? Are they still out there? Does she go back with Morgan Freeman? WHAT THE HELL HAPPENS!!!??? I don't really care if a movie ends with some unanswered questions like Boogie Nights, The Blair Witch Project, or even Casablanca, but at least there is some closure to those movies. This had nothing.Nevertheless, I still credit this movie for reinventing the horror genre, and for all the crap wrong with it, I would rather watch this any Jason or Freddy movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, all the (horror-) movie guides you might check for this title will tell you that "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" is a must for every horror freak. A good horror movie, in my opinion, has to include the following:- A good and entertaining script - Not too many dialogs, because it's action that brings satisfaction! - Scenes where you can see why the movie deserves it's R rating for extreme violence!And this movie broke all that rules that would make it good. Long dialogs and beautiful 15min shots of a car driving around in Texas make it a hard thing to hold on till the end. And, when there's some action in the film, the lack of any light in most of the scenes additionally increase the entertainment value.In a nutshell: The only thing that I learned from the movie is that a single character can scream for 30 minutes without breathing.It may have been a cool movie the time it was made, but today's movies are better - so don't bother with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I realize that this is one of the first slasher films, and I have a good quarter century bias against this film, but it really isn't all that scary, and that's coming from someone who was frightened of "Gremlins" as a child. Most of the scenes cut away from the violence immediately, and it's back to riveting "where did our friends go?" waiting around scenes. Also, the backwoods hick nature of the family makes them more comical than scary, so the last thirty minutes of the film is just sort of silly, like a weird Beverly Hillbillies/Addams family hybrid. My questions are: what happens to the trucker who initially stops to save Sally? She gets away, but he's stuck there with Leatherface and all he did was help her out. Also, could the wheelchair guy be more whiny and useless? Lastly, were the teens and their van based on "Scooby-doo?" Every time they were in that green van, I was waiting for Scrappy to come and ruin the fun. And in the end, this film is like an episode of Scooby-doo with Scrappy: subpar. There are Muppets scarier than this.</fullReview>

IT WAS A TOTAL LET DOWN!!! This film was supposed to be scary but it was totally boring and just dragged on and the murders were crap and hardly gorey at all and at the end when the girl is being held in the house and is screaming constantly gave me one mother of a headache. The acting was terrible, the storyline was crap (and i know this was based on a true-life event, but, please??) and Leatherface looks like Mankind from WWF, Mankind is more vicious than Leatherface in the ring and all that WWF stuff is all a put-on. How this film got a cult following is way beyond me. If you have ever seen Mystery Science Theatre 3000 (film or series) that is what me and my mates ended up doing during the whole of the film.

I probably should have just stopped the tape, but I somehow hoped that it would get better, but no such luck there. It is not scary at all, it's just stupid, and I have no idea where people get all these psychological theories from it, it's just a braindead movie. The only part I felt was satisfying was when the fat, whiny guy in the wheelchair got killed. This film didn't give any insight into the killers, why they killed, and why Leatherface wore the mask and didn't speak. You also don't feel for the victims, you just wait for them to be taken out. The movie started out great, nothing beats that FBI warning, but after that it went downhill. Unlike other movies that take a while to go downhill, this one takes a plunge straight to the bottom right after the opening dialogue. Although I haven't seen any of them, I'd be willing to bet that the sequels actually may be better than this trash. I'm glad I only payed a dollar for it, now I'll never have to sit through it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate in over-hyped horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is often touted as one of the progenitors of the slasher sub-genre of horror films, as well as the magnum opus of writer/director Tobe Hooper. While I certainly can't dispute either of those things, those points also do not mean that this film is everything it is hyped up to be. Nor does it seem worthy of the many sequels that would follow in it's wake.I found many spots in the film, especially within the first half, that simply drag on way too long. Scenes where nothing really happens. By the time we reach the first kill of the film, you are already about 40 minutes into the film (which has a total run time of about 90 minutes). This glacial pacing in the early part of the film, while perhaps trying to build a mood, simply inspired boredom for me.Also, while this film is steeped in much controversy, including being banned in other countries for it's "graphic content," and being known as one of the earliest slasher films, it is extremely light on blood and gore. Many later films of this sub-genre would be much more noted for their bloodiness and "graphic content." What Hooper looks to strive for is creating horror through a macabre atmosphere, as the eerie score and odd camera angles and settings would seem to bear out. But these are only effective to a point and some of the strange camera shots quickly become repetitive and owe more to directorial excesses, than to any attempts at psychological horror.Since none of the actors create any characters you really come to care about, nor does the script often give you any clarity on just what is happening and why, the film hampers itself in making you truly care about anything that happens to these people. And when you are trying to scare someone, if you don't make them feel for either the characters or the situation, that is extremely hard, if not impossible, to do. The only scene that was even remotely scary was the chase scene, at just over halfway through the film. The terror of that scene (which was quite long) is visceral, but it alone cannot make up for so much wasted time earlier in the film, nor for the over-use of specialized camera shots, which make the film seem to drag on way too often.Is "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" a macabre film? Yes. Is it a bizarre film? Certainly. Is it even a little bit creepy in some spots? Sure enough. But it is not one of the scariest films ever made, as it often gets billed as. It may be one of the original slashers of cinema history, but later films would do a much better job of defining that sub-genre, which this film may have helped to originate. If you are a fan of this franchise, or a die-hard slasher fanatic, then this is a film you probably should see, if only for the historical significance alone. Everyone else can give it a pass, as there are much better slasher films, which are truly much scarier than this one could ever hope to be. In short, "don't believe the hype!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am equally amazed at both extremes when it comes to the general consensus on "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre". I can't understand those who claim it is a flawless masterpiece (not that they don't offer solid arguments, see the IMDb comments for some well-reasoned reviews which I can't really argue against), and I certainly can't understand those who claim this is some sort of awful, laughable slasher flick lacking any sort of intelligence.The way some people talk about this film you could be forgiven for thinking they were discussing a "Friday the 13th" sequel. Compared to many (most?) films in its genre, "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is fairly smart and fairly different. Sure, there's some awfully convenient plot devices, but the things people complain about! I read several comments on this site that asked why the truck driver didn't drive off in his truck at the end of the film... Er, because if he turned back he would be running straight into Leatherface? He got out of the car to see what he had hit and he was confronted with a chainsaw-toting maniac. Wouldn't you have run? The silly things people complain about...No, this film is not flawless, but there is some quality film-making here. I do truly believe that in the horror genre films are almost always best if the director is forced to be creative for lack of a budget. The 2003 remake of this film is proof of this, certainly, a fake, bloated, amazingly stupid product focused on gore and flashy editing. Tobe Hooper, shooting on 16mm and probably lacking any form of sophisticated equipment, is forced to do his best here, and it shows. There's some really well-staged scenes; the chase through the woods and the dinner scene are absolutely enthralling sequences, particularly the memorably grotesque latter scene.There's some bad acting and a lack of sophistication in the direction sometimes, but when you're making a visceral feature like this one you don't need to look good. The aesthetic works well and Hooper shows a good understanding of how to handle a horror set piece. "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" takes a while to get going, but from around forty minutes onwards it's really quite an involving film that stands up to scrutiny after thirty four years. It's a very good movie. Not a masterpiece, but very good. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing that is definitely not dated about this horror movie, is the soundtrack under the credits. I don't know of another horror movie that skipped the horror theme music and substituted an eerie questioning tone (ooohWWR? ...ooohWWR?) It's a memorable part-animal/part-music noise and it sets the creepy tone immediately. The best scenes in the movie come early - the first kill is the most shocking, followed by a malevolent sliding-door slam that suggests Leatherface is a horrifying force to be reckoned with. Sadly he ends up being the usual beleaguered, sympathetic, bullied, dumb child (with a falsetto voice? um... OK). I found the second half of the movie to be at least as silly as that. The last part is so unstructured that you beg for someone to stuff a sock in Sally's mouth, to shut up her screaming. The remake allows viewer fear to build up for long stretches, which was effective, but that movie also descends into silliness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Deeply, Deeply Scary Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know that I've ever been more scared on a purely gut level by any horror film as much as I was by Tobe Hooper's grisly 1974 cult classic. The current batch of torture porn crap passing as horror films obviously owe much to this film, and they've borrowed certain characteristics wholesale: the fetid, rotten production design; the fixation on human dismemberment and carnage; the depiction of rural Americans as psychotic, deformed cannibals. But the original "Texas Chain Saw Massacre" is better than just about every modern-day horror film in just about every way. Advanced technology has allowed horror-brat directors like Eli Roth and Alexandre Aja to show the destruction of a human body in literal and painstaking detail, but they have no idea how to actually scare an audience. Hooper, by contrast, uses actual skill to suggest much more than he actually shows, and if you think about this film afterwards, you'll realize that there is very little bloodshed. The violence in this film is actually somewhat understated, and it's all the more terrifying for that. I will never forget the first appearance of Leatherface, who thumps a guy on the head with a mallet and drags him down to his lab with all the nonchalance of a butcher readying a slab of meat for sale. Eli Roth would have focused all of his attention on the impact of the mallet with the skull -- we probably would have been treated to an image of the skull caving in and blood splattering the walls. Hooper, instead, understands that it's the casual nature of the killing that's most disturbing -- not the bloodshed -- and that's what he shows. Hooper decided to make his movie about frightening situations rather than graphic gore and as a result created a small horror masterpiece.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of kids pick up a hitchhiker while driving through Texas. After the hitchhiker goes nuts, they get lost and end up at a residence. A most sinister residence, because it is the home of Leatherface and his cannibalistic family.I watched these films in the wrong order. I've seen the remake, the prequel to the remake, Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2... but never the original until now. So I got a little surprise because I had figured it would be a lot like the remake or like "House of 1000 Corpses". And while it has some similarities to these, it's really its own film.There's a difference between 1970s and 1980s horror. The 1980s had more of a dark humor, even when it wasn't intentional. The 1970s were more gritty, much more exploitative. My point can be made by watching this one and then watching the sequel -- the tone is entirely different. I often cite "Last House on the Left" and I'll do it again now -- this is the epitome of exploitative and gritty 1970s film. But "Texas Chain Saw Massacre" isn't far behind.We have the now familiar aspects (the hitchhiker, the house, the chainsaw) but done in a grisly manner. This isn't a "fun" hitchhiker who wants to play guitar and smoke -- he's deranged and carries photos of mutilated cattle on him. And this isn't a "fun" house with so much blood and gore that it becomes more fantasy than reality -- when the girl comes in contact with the meat hook, you can feel it.What I think this film does as far as horror history is concerned, is it has a lot of running and chasing. Many films have running and chasing, but that is what defines this film -- how far can you be chased by a chainsaw before you can run no farther? Will you make it to the gas station? Will that save you? This film is a classic and a must-see. The most disturbing part for me didn't even involve a chainsaw, but an old man. You'll know it when you see it -- absolutely disgusting. And that's what sells this film. Before the dozens of knockoffs, this was the original and in some ways no remake will ever compare. Do check this out.</fullReview>

If I am not mistaken, there is an old VHS version with the following captions regarding Elmer Wayne Henley and Dean Corll (The Pasadena, Texas "Candyman" murderer). As John Larroquette narrates the infamous idyllic summer prologue, the story begins.It is gritty, and looks to be 110 degrees. The hitchhiker is classic. Definitely insane. They are driving an old Chevy van, and eventually (after the hitcher educates them about head cheese) drop him off quickly. He has gouged his hand out, just for fun.So the suspense builds. They are looking for Kathy Hardesty's grandfather's house, now deserted. They find a lot filled with abandoned cars. Why?. It is never explained.Leatherface (Bubba) does not appear until later. We know something horrible is going to happen, we just don't know when, or to whom. The metal door slamming shut as we catch a glimpse of "Leatherface"/Bubba is truly scary. More than any gore, dismembering, or scenes from the recent "Hostel".I can recall re-watching this in the very early 90's and thinking, wow, this could have been bigger!! Another film you may enjoy is the original "Toolbox Murders" my friend at the time also noted it had the same deranged and paranoid slant to it. Great and original. 9/10</fullReview>

It's not at all scary, so that can't be it. There is no gore in it at all, so that can't be it. It's very low budget and the print I saw had many washed out scenes, so it can't be the film quality. The acting is as amateurish as Night of the Living Dead, so that can't account for its high reputation. And it's really slow-moving and dull. Maybe I'm just a lug head, but to me this movie is not very good. I can think of many other low budget horror films that are much better: Evil Dead, Dementia 13, Night of the Living Dead for example.

It was great for a laugh...maybe not even that...80 minutes of screaming, four main characters died within the first 20 minuites...there's not much more I can say. I don't even remember their names, they were on screen for so little time!If you're up for a terrible movie, go for it... as for me, I'm going to rent the 2003 version and hope for the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a connosieur of this kind of brutality, and the only reason I am writing this is because one of my best friends played the masked man who ran around with the axe. He wouldn't like it if I gave his name, but we are good friends, and he knows I hated this bunch of garbage altho I've seen this film several times. If some go for that sort of thing, I'll just keep my mouth shut. The only bit of info I can give about the masked man is that he had an uncle who played in silent and talking pictures up through the 1950s. Acting sort of ran in the family, and what an adventurous family it was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This story begins with me and my friends one summer... All we did was rent horror movies... 2 or 3 every night for two months straight... One night, i saw The Texas Chainsaw Massacre on the movie rental rack... And under protest from the two friends i was with, we rented it... I had never seen it before... They had... And so, at midnight, we put it in the VCR... And then the laughter began... The idea that a girl could do nothing but run through the woods screaming her head off with a chainsaw toating killer on her heels is pretty laughable... Why didn't she just hide somewhere and keep her fool mouth shut? Some people could argue that she was dumb with fear... Personally i think she was just dumb... Fair to say i didn't like the movie much... I had seen better just prior... But i will say that i have seen worse... And the fact that it was somewhat based on a true story makes you think... but not much... I won't be renting it again any time soon, and i surely will not be recommending it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually the older horror films are pretty good, but after watching this, I was very dissapointed. For one, the film wasn't very long. Two, the acting wasn't all that great. Three this film is not a good classic horror film such as some are like, "The Shining" or "Cujo" or something that is better than this piolntless film. Also the charachter "Sally" screamed very strangely. This film is not worth renting, and DEFINETLY not buying on VHS or DVD. This is a very terrible film. I give it a 2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I began to watch the film Texas chain saw massacre, I was building up inside me pictures of stories that I had heard from friends about girls on meat hooks etc. In fact, when I watched the film I got nothing more than a fat keg running around holding a smoking heap of bolts that was meant to pass as a frightening instrument of torture. It was about as scary as re-arranging my sock draw. There was no message or moral to the story it was just a load of you know what. I read another review of this film on this web site which states that "it makes you wake up to reality" - yeah like everyone goes round cutting each other up with chain saws... well actually more like: yeah sure after you watch it you wake up to the reality that all the hype you heard about it was a bunch of bull and there is nothing powerful or interesting about this film at all.</fullReview>

That's really all this movie is. This movie can be funny at times because the people in this movie are so stupid.

		<shortDescription>Simply the best horror movie I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre of 1974 is a masterpiece in the horror genre and simply the best horror movie I've ever seen. Only the name says it all: On the one hand it sounds hard, cruel and dramatic, on the other hand, it might be the title of a documentation as well. And that's why I love this movie so much: - It has this factual atmosphere, which I think is far more realistic that if it would have been dramatized; because in this documentation style, everything that happens seems to be so real. For sure this is a question of taste whether you rather like it realistic or bloody, but I think it is good the movie is so factual.- The figures in this movie are worked out really good, for example the crazy hitch-hiker, the emotionless-seeming Kirk, (sexy) Pam with her bad presentiments (as the movie shows, she was perfectly right), and not to forget, the filling station attendant with his rough attitude and his mixture of sympathy and lust for kill. The actors are all really good and you can identify with the group of teenagers.- Tobe Hooper is very good in building up excitemtent. For more than an hour, there is nothing cruel or scaring, just a few bad signs (the hitch-hiker of course, or the drunken guy telling them sinnister things), everything seems to be so happy, but then Kirk gets careless, and at one go, the whole day turns into a massacre.- There is a lot of brutality in this movie, but Tobe Hooper isn't in need of bloody slasher scenes like in Hostel or in the remake. All brutality is rather in the viewer's fantasy than on the screen. It's the atmosphere (for example this legendary starting scene) and the insinuated sequences that make this movie so scaring.- It is thrilling till the end. Sally, who will be the only one to survive, is not personated as the hero of the movie (like Jessica Biel in the remake), and she is captured in the house and nearly killed. Even in the last sequence of the movie is is not clear until the end whether Leatherfae gets her or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The texas chainsaw Massacre defined the lasher genre and was a staple of american cinema when it came out and still remains a dominant prescence in the genre today. People that are not into horror films will not like this movie. It defines horror. One of the very few films that does. The film was obviously made on a shoestring budget but Tobe Hooper's Taut direction, the eerie and effective cinematography of Daniel Pearl and the strong newcomer performances of Marilyn Burns and Gunnar Hansen. Made this film a midnight movie hit. A group of five young people fall into a nightmare. Upon stopping for gas at a desolate gas station in Texas. The encounter a cannibalistic family whom are out to murder and feed upon the youngsters. The film really isn't much more than that. But it's pretty hard to take. So get ready for one hell of a crazy ride. The movie that defines Disturbed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So I'm not part of the bandwagon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hated this film.I still fail to see how it, along with F13, managed to acquire a cult following. TCM is critically acclaimed for its rawness, for its brutality, and for unrelenting portrayal of a warped family based on everyone's favorite psycho Ed Gein. And granted, it has perks and high points . . . but good God, did it ever annoy the hell out of me!Maybe I'm just sick and twisted and desensitized by violence in the entertainment mediums, but I don't sympathize with the victims solely because they're about to be slaughtered in a 16mm slasher film. The TCM family of films was the first to show me this. I did not like the characters. Although, the characters in TCM did teach me a small lesson ? I learned that even if I feel sympathy for someone who is physically disabled, that person can be so annoying that I'd ignore those feelings and want to see him crippled further (specifically, something to permanently incapacitate the jaw.) "I'll cut you some slack, Franky, given the circumstance. But if you deserve a punch to the face, I don't care if you are in a wheelchair, you will get punched to the face." Texas Chainsaw Massacre also taught me why other movies ignore the realism of having their characters not scream when they should. Sally, sweet Sally, what powerful lungs you have . . . she screams. And screams. And continues screaming. And I wanted more than anything for Leatherface to shut her up. For the love of God, end the scream before it goes on for another 30 minutes. Gramps? Please, maybe you can shut her up! Someone! Is there a competent killer in the house? I hesitate to say Texas Chainsaw Massacre has a plot, just as I hesitate to say any slasher film has a plot. A "scenario" would be a better phrasing. It's a bit unnerving how vividly and accurately three words can describe the typical slasher scenario: "Kids. Isolated. Killer." If you need more than that, you've never seen a slasher film. If you expect more than that, you've never seen a slasher film. So I really can't criticize TCM for having any less of a plot than, say, Halloween. I *can* say the unsympathetic characters in TCM made me care that the scenario they were to enact was so threadbare. Leatherface running around in an apron that eerily resembles a dress struck fear in me for all the wrong reasons, and I really did not need to see the cut scene on the DVD where he puts makeup and the Grandma's wig on the mask. Leatherface running through the woods with the chainsaw over his head while Sally screamed and screamed and ran, and went on way too long (much like the action films that would come 30 years later) ? all of went to prove that without a doorway to pop out of, Leatherface is a pansy who can't shut up one girl. Anyway, contrary to what I had written in my original review I did revisit Texas Chainsaw Massacre with hopes that perhaps I had let expectation get in the way of seeing the movie for what it was. Also contrary to what I wrote in the original reviews, I did check out all the sequels and even the remake. While my opinion has come away from the extreme hatred I initially held for the film, it didn't come away by very much. I still more or less feel the same way: it has some nice camera work early on in the film, wonderful colors in the dusk sky, and a sweet camera move as it glides under a swing. I'm still impressed that the movie for the most part refrains from dragging out its "stalking" sequences with false scares, and that Tobe gets some kills over and done with before the audience can blink. The music has never stuck with me, nor has much else. Revisiting Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I still did not like characters, although I did find myself tolerating them a lot more. And actually, early on in the film I thought perhaps my opinion might ? just might ? have changed in the years since my last viewing. Alas, that glimmer of hope slowly faded until the bottom dropped out entirely at the sound of Sally's screams. Sally, sweet Sally, shut up already. Oh well, looks like I'm going to continue to walk a part from the bandwagon on this one. I still feel that Texas Chainsaw Massacre is living breathing proof that shock-fest exploitation films lose their power to truly and rightly be considered classics. TCM shocked the generation who grew up on it, but I come from a different time where all of TCM's descendants have robbed it of what power it might have held ? that first glimpse of 16mm terror that no one had ever seen before. Now it's just the first in a long monotonous line. In closing: There's a difference between shocks and suspense, the latter gives a film its staying power. I still hold my breath watching Psycho. I still feel a rush of anxiety hearing Benny cue up his infamous strings, and I still feel a chill run down my spine as the camera pushes in on Norman Bates. Texas Chainsaw Massacre, by contrast, has no more shocks, thus has no power over me.</fullReview>

And all I have to say is that no one seems to think for themself, because everyone is saying that this is the best movie ever. It's really not. If you want a good horror movie, watch Night of the Living Dead, Evil Dead, the first Nightmare on Elm Street, Dawn of the Dead, etc. Not this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By this point, nearly seventy years of horror cinema seemed irrelevant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is one of the key developments to modern horror cinema. "Psycho" showed that a monster could be anyone and could be located anywhere. Still, there were several elements that hearkened to traditional suspense narratives. It was 1960, and the country had yet to experience true horror. Than Vietnam had begun, and the nation witnessed the cold reality of violence on their TV sets. "Night of the Living Dead" came along and invented the modern horror film than. The horror was created by the government and on the home front, not a mystical dreamland. Still, there were several classic and traditional "monster" movies released in the next few years. "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" was released and the film industry took notice. The traditional, more naive horror movie was dead. Nearly seventy years of horror cinema seemed irrelevant.This was all with good reason. "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" was one of the most visceral and disturbing horror films ever made. In addition to consistent scares, there were several elements that have been prevalent in most horror films ever since. It had a darker than dark sense of humor, yet was done without any camp or irony. The chuckles made it all the more uneasing so Tobe Hopper could catch you off guard. Plus, the "heros" are just as unlikable as the villains, if not more so. The opening scenes in the van show a group of people no one in their right mind would want to be around. It is only at the end when Sally in placed into situations of intense danger do we feel any sympathy towards the protagonists.But get past all the historical significance, this is an excellent film. Even over thirty years after release, it is still terrifying, which can not be said of many well-remembered horror films. The performances are average, but no one goes into this film expecting Olivier. The direction by Tobe Hopper is masterful minimalism. Simply put, the man knows how to build tension. Its a shame he never made another great film after this, and eventually directed the incredibly overrated "Poltergeist". Still, whether or not it was a fluke on his behalf, this is a great film.

		<fullReview>I must admit when I saw this as a kid, it scared the hell out of me.But watching it again recently, it wasn't nearly as horrifying. At times the lighting is poor to the point of distraction, there is only one real "scare," and the film is surprisingly un-gory (actually, Jaws, made the following year, has far more scares &amp; blood &amp; gore... yet somehow got a PG rating from MPAA)Although released only 4 years prior to John Carpenter's 1978 Halloween, Chainsaw doesn't come anywhere close to the subtle build of tension, fear &amp; isolation of that film. The character development in TCM is also suprisingly sparse, which is why Halloween works better as a whole. Though Kirk, Pam &amp; Sally do provide some eye candy (for what it's worth).Several of the chase scenes are messy &amp; laughable, but they are tempered with some wonderful tracking shots around "the house" during daylight hours. The film comes alive when there is enough light to produce a nice shot.A must watch when considering the development &amp; history of horror films, but not quite as strong as some other classics in the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a horror classic, but a comedy classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not really sure whether this movie was supposed to be scary and supposed to be taken seriously. If it was, then I can only say that it failed miserably. We have a non-existent plot, stupid characters and a totally non-scary murderer with a chain-saw. I can't remember this movie having so much as a single scary moment, and as far as gore is considered, I've seen much bloodier films too (e.g. "Braindead"). On the other hands, me and a bunch of friends had a GREAT time watching this movie, laughing at the ridiculous acting and pointing out the never-ending list of completely stupid behaviour by the main characters. Example: If you're being chased by a crazed, chainsaw wielding maniac through a dark wood, the last thing you want to do is scream and give away your position, but the main character in this movie doesn't do anything BUT scream while being chased. It was also hilarious when the chain-saw guy first cut up an entire door with his saw before actually just opening it in the normal way and going through.This movie apparently is a classic, and I wholly agree with that, but instead of a horror classic I'd call it a comedy classic. I can't remember having laughed so hard at a movie's sheer stupidity and awfulness since "Batman" (the old one with Adam West).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(There may be some spoilers here so beware.)Honestly, I thought it was a joke. I really didn't think this was seriously the movie everyone raved about. It's TERRIBLE! I mean it's really, REALLY bad. How on earth ANYBODY could enjoy this film is far beyond my vast, vast, incredibly vast understanding. It so bad you cannot even laugh AT it.First of all the film's so called 'gritty' look is, plain and simple, the result of the shoddiest photography this side of 70's [adult films]. The framing is horrifically composed and makes a drunken wedding video look like Laurence of Arabia. The sound is inaudible and the dialogue, worthless as it is, is nothing more than mumbles. As the 'story' develops so does the incomprehension. Mid-way through you'll tell yourself 'This cannot become anymore senseless.' Well it does. By the end you'll be completely lost and then...it's over. Just like that. I was assuming there was half an hour left but it just ends without resolving anything or giving us the payoff we deserve. What a rip-off!There is also ZERO suspense. Characters are killed almost right away leaving no room for excitement. Plus there is only ONE massacre with a chainsaw and you don't even see anything and it mostly occurs off camera. The final chase with the one character that actually gets some interaction with the bad guy is obviously the best bit of the movie but by this point I just wanted it to be over.I've no idea why so many people say this is a great movie or call it 'horror with a dark comic edge'. It's nothing of the sort. It's an embarrassingly amateur schlockfest that Ed Wood himself would disown. Check out the 2003 remake which is a zillion times the movie this dreadful nonsense is. Do not come within a mile of this! You have been warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Five friends go on a road trip to their grandfathers house and discover along the way that his grave has been desecrated. Once they arrive there, two of the friends venture across to a neighbouring property in the belief that they'll be able to get hold of some gasoline for their van. However, they unwittingly stumble across a chainsaw wielding lunatic who begins to pick them off one by one.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of those films that has developed a bit of a cult following and seems to be regarded by many as being one of the greatest horror films of all time. However, watching it today I really can't understand why it has garnered such a reputation...The principal cast are a bunch of annoying teens which seem to be the staple for many horror films, they make the clichéd dumb decisions such as picking up a lunatic hitchhiker (even though they all agree that he doesn't look right). They then unwittingly end up in a neighbouring property to said lunatics and find themselves being picked off one by one.A good horror film will provide the audience with atmosphere and creepiness, but director Tobe Hooper is uninterested in all of this and just decides to have the chainsaw wielding nutter pounce on his victims with no real warning. Yes it's quite effective and is likely to make you jump (at least the first time), but as the film progresses it becomes more and more predictable and this ultimately means that much of the film is devoid of suspense. Character development is also non-existent meaning that we're not really given any reason to care for any of the characters.I can recall two good scenes in this film; the scene where the first victim enters the house and the camera pans round the front room is quite chilling and the scene where Sally is being chased round the woods is quite scary and suspenseful, but sadly these moments are few and far between.It's evident that Hooper isn't really interested in his characters, but his directing is actually excellent and he does frame many intense and shocking scenes and certainly gets the most out of his cast. However, the final 15 minutes really undo all his hard work; Hooper goes a bit overboard here and over directs and also allows the cast to overact which cheapens what little he had achieved prior to these moments. The real killer here (excuse the pun) comes with what happens to Sally in the house; they have her in their house and could easily kill her, but decide to let Grandad kill her even though he doesn't have the strength to hit her over the head with a hammer then she escapes??? It's probably one of the lamest and most contrived of reasons for a victim to escape her captors. Why didn't one of the others just hit her over the head and have done with it?Texas Chainsaw Massacre has one sole purpose and that purpose is to shock, but that's really all it does. It has no real suspense, no atmosphere, no creepiness and no characters to care about. Many people seem to put it on a pedestal that it simply doesn't belong on. In fact when it ended I thought the best thing about this film was Marilyn Burns nipples.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Pro-Vegan Film Ever Made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably a prime example of 'style over substance.' This movie's got some serious technical skill, even for today. That's not to say it doesn't have substance. A theme seems to be an ironic swap, evidenced further by a character's rant about cattle in a slaughter house early in the film. For the rest of the film, we see people in a sort of slaughter house, and frankly, they're not treated much better than the cattle.Intensity builds from mildly unsettling to outright disturbing. Ever have nightmares where you're watching a horrifying scene unfold before your eyes as if you were an invisible third person, unable to turn away or retreat from the craziness that's going on? That's this movie. It's like a nightmare you can't wake up from.It achieves this with some brilliant camera-work and spends a good portion of the movie setting the tone. It prepares you for what's coming next, while telling you that you'll never truly be prepared for what's coming next. It looks cheaply made (well, I guess it looks that way because it WAS), which doesn't take away from this movie like it takes away from most movies--in fact, it adds to the realism. Everything in this movie, in theory, COULD have occurred back then. I'm not saying it did and we just didn't know about it-- I'm just saying it would have been possible for such a situation to occur. And just sitting back and thinking that all of this could have been possible just makes it even creepier.After reading up some trivia on this movie, I was surprised to find how much of this movie was actually real. No, psychopaths didn't wear masks made of human faces and chase screaming girls in classic 70's jeans with an actual intent to murder them. But the working conditions were terrible. They were filming long hours to save on equipment rental costs during a heatwave in a house full of film crew members with no air conditioning. In Texas. Due to budget restrictions, one guy actually had to lie completely still while they pretended to behead him by holding a running chainsaw three inches from his face. The stench in the farm house got so bad crew members were stepping outside to vomit between shoots. That's what I call dedication! No wonder everyone was hysterical by the time the film wrapped.Aside from its technical execution and genuinely disturbing atmosphere and intensity, the movie itself really isn't anything special. It's a major influence on the slasher genre, and rightfully so, if only because it was the first of a handful of slashers that just happened to introduce many of the genre's classic tropes. Surprisingly, for a movie with this kind of reputation, it's very low in the gore department. Not much is actually seen on screen. A lot is left to your imagination, and for a movie like this, that's definitely something worth bragging about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A Whole Family of Draculas"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Five friends decide to visit their Grandfather's grave that has been desecrated in ritualistic fashion. Things aren't going so well, because they had to lug their handicapped brother, Franklin along with them. To make matters worse, they are shaken up by a sadistic hitchhiker (Edwin Neal) . The real nightmare begins when they go to their old family house and they encounter a chainsaw wielding maniac. This is NOT one of my favorite horror movies! I think it's overpraised and dated, but it is a pretty good horror movie. I'd be lying if I said it wasn't. Leatherface has never been one of my favorites for some reason. I find him dull compared to some of the other horror icons. It isn't a fun film by any means! It has an amateurish quality that works in its favor, but also hampers it in ways as well. This is just raw and gritty filmmaking, and I certainly have to give it credit for that. This felt like real terror. It also has a subtle, yet creepy score that chills you to the bone. They didn't have a huge budget to work with and they managed a solid horror movie. My main problem with this movie, is that it's somewhat dull at times. It's never "boring" , just a few too many scenes with characters wandering around with boring conversation. Some will call that effective, I call it meandering. This was a product of its time, and rather daring back then. By today's standards, it comes across as somewhat tame. It's disturbing, don't get me wrong. I just think the sequels and subsequent remakes have tarnished its reputation. They really lucked out because of the excellent use of location. That big house is very eerie! I don't know if I'd call it a fluke, but Tobe Hooper hasn't done anything as successful as this. He was certainly feeling it during this movie! The shots during Sally's torture scenes are very hard to endure I don't know what happened, but Tobe seemed to lose his touch after this. There isn't much gore in this movie, but there is disturbing things. Marilyn Burns legitimately cut herself on the branches, while filming. People are bludgeoned to death, and more. It's not very gory, but it doesn't really need that much of it. There are some throwaway characters, but there is a few performances that truly standout. Marilyn Burns is overshadowed in some ways, but she deserves all the praise in the world. It must have been emotionally and physically exhausting to play that part. She came through big time and screamed like a champ. She's pretty easy on the eyes as well. Gunnar Hansen is the original Leatherface! He deserves critical acclaim for that alone. The weird pig noises were creepy and he was very intimidating! Paul A. Partain is both sympathetic and annoying. That being said, I couldn't help but feel sorry for him. He's in a wheel-chair, so that makes it hard for anyone to hate him. It was a dynamic performance in my opinion. Edwin Neal is a scary SOB! I will never pick up a hitchhiker, solely because of this performance. You won't forget him anytime soon. Jim Siedow yells too much as the Cook, but he played his part well. The last 10 minutes are legendary! Especially the last 5 minutes. The last scene of Marilyn Burns on the getaway truck, maniacally laughing, is classic! Despite that it isn't one of my favorites, I did give it a lot of praise. It is somewhat overrated, but it does a lot right as well. There is a reason why it became so popular among horror fans! I'm not afraid to admit that. It should be mandatory viewing to watch this movie, if you're a horror fan. 8.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's has its moments and that's very good, but as an horror movie it completely fails. The actors aren't acting, they're overacting the whole time and the screenplay is the average B-Movie. That wouldn't be a problem if the film was any scary, but it's not. Beside one or two jump-scares there's nothing more. I find this very overrated and kind of silly. From the start I found myself laughing at the bunch of stupid scenes this is full of. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good time and see a bloody film, but there's no way I'd recommended to someone who wants to be scared.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Greatest Horror Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Scary,Terrifying And Unforgettable Horror/Cult Classic From Tobe Hooper.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is one of the greatest Horror film ever made,an excellent,scary and terrifying Horror classic that combines amazing direction,great performances,non-stop terror,an eerie score and stunning photography. All of those elements make The Texas Chain Saw Massacre a great Horror film but also a Cult classic and one of the scariest movies of all-time.Set in Texas,The Texas Chain Saw Massacre tells the story of five youths including Sally Hardesty(Marilyn Burns)her wheelchair bound brother Franklin Hardesty(Paul A. Partain)who along with friends Jerry(Allen Danziger),Kirk(William Vali)and Pam(Teri McMinn) are on a trip visiting Sally and Franklin's Grandfather's grave site because of recent grave robbing going on. While on the trip,Sally,Franklin and their friends cross paths with a Chainsaw welding maniac named Leatherface(Gunner Hanson)and his family of grave-robbing cannibals.Released in 1974,The Texas Chain Saw Massacre while receiving mixed reviews from critics was a Box Office hit grossing 30 million dollars well above it's 300,000$ budget. Over time critical reviews for The Texas Chain Saw Massacre have been much more positive and the movie is now seen as a classic Horror film and one of the all-time great Cult classics and it's reputation is well deserved. While The Texas Chain Saw Massacre later spawn a remake,sequels and reboots none of the latter films have been able to match the raw and gritty greatness of Tobe Hooper's film. Right from it's disturbing and powerful opening,The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a brilliant Horror film that pulls you into a nightmare that grabs you by the throat with with frightening and visceral intensity that never stops until the very end. TCM is a film that is scary and horrific as well as dark and brutal and you as viewer are being harmed physically and mentally with no positive outcome. The scares in TCM are amazing and well-done with tons of great build-up and suspense because before and after each scary scene there is a sense of dread and fear that hangs over the film and never stops. TCM can also be seen as a Slasher film because there are some elements(masked killer,final girl,young victims,isolated location)in TCM that can be seen as a precursor to the Slasher genre that dominated the 1970s and 80s so in way TCM was a great foreshadowing. What also make TCM scary is the photography by Daniel Pearl. Pearl's photography gives the movie an atmospheric and realistic look almost like watching a documentary where it feels like you're not watching a movie but something happening in real life while at the same time making the movie look visually stunning. The atmosphere is also incredible because of the hot weather during the day and night where you feel the heat and sweat just come of the screen. TCM while still a Horror movie TCM truly captures the tone and feel of the Nixon-era of the late 1960s and early 70s during that time:Vietnam,Hippies,The Manson Family and The Watergate scandal and while none of those things are mentioned they hang over the movie. While TCM is still a scary film there are also moments of Black Comedy and Humor where some of the characters,moments and dialog are sometimes over the top to the point where you are laughing at the insanity and chaos. TCM often has a reputation of being one of the bloodiest and goriest movies of all-time and while TCM has some blood the film is not very gory or bloody because when you see the violence the blood and gore is inside of your mind and is suggested because of the blood on the walls. TCM is more about terror and fright and it succeeds without gore. The character Leatherface is one of the greatest and most iconic villains is Horror films and in movies in general because Leatherface is a character that is mentally gone and has an uncontrollable rage that is scary. Where as Freddy Kruger uses sharp finger blades,Jason Voorhees uses a Machete and Michael Myers uses a large butcher knife,Leatherface uses a chainsaw as his weapon of choice and when Leatherface uses that chainsaw you feel like he never turns it off and uses on his victims with violent brutality. The fact that Leatherface wears a mask made of skin and the fact that his whole family are cannibals makes Leatherface more disturbing. Leatherface's first appearance is one of the most iconic moments in the history of Horror films and you will be horrified by his appearance. The ending of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is one of the best endings ever caught on film because there is scares,suspense and a surprising way of using a chainsaw which is weird,unforgettable and dramatic. A great ending to a classic film.The cast is great. Marilyn Burns is brilliant as Sally,with Burns bringing a realism,depth and terror to the role. R.I.P Ms Burns,you were one Horror cinemas greatest scream queens. Gunner Hanson is excellent and scary as Leatherface,one of the greatest movie villains of all-time with Gunner,grunting,screaming,shouting and running with the chainsaw. Edwin Neal is wonderful as The Hitchhiker,a person picked up on the road. Jim Siedow is outstanding as Old Man that runs a gas station. Paul A. Partain is funny and memorable as Franklin,Sally's brother. Allen Danziger(Jerry),William Vail(Kirk),Teri McMinn(Pam)and John Dugan(Grandfather)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for a voice cameo by John Larroquette who reads the beginning narration.The direction by Tobe Hooper is amazing with Hooper bringing a gritty and atmospheric look to the film with zooms,close ups with high and low angles. Fantastic direction,Hooper.The score by Tobe Hooper and Wayne Bell is creepy,unsettling, and fits perfectly with the tone of the movie. An intense and experimental score from Hooper and Bell.In final word,if you love Horror Movies or films in general,I highly suggest you see The Texas Chain Saw Massacre,an excellent and terrifying Horror classic that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Authentic In Tt's Crappy Look It's One Of A Kind.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the killings of notorious hermit Ed Gein. "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is a marvel in both it's look and location. Where better to set a movie where you can legally own a shotgun at the age of 12?A bunch of friends driving through the Texas fields pick up a hitch-hiker, whose erratic behaviour gets him kicked out swiftly. They have to make an unexpected pit stop, where they seem to meet the only local in the area (Who is out of gas and forces them to remain stranded for a while). A few of them set off to explore the area whilst waiting to get back on the road, and when they don't return later that evening the remaining group set out to look for them. Unknowingly walking into Hell itself where "Leatherface" (Gunnar Hansen) is it's Leviathan.It's gritty low budget cinematography and crappy documentary-drama feel is what makes this movie age so well. Usually I'm against horror movies where the victims are no more developed than helpless butcher meat, but the locations elevate their presence and isolation so well it all seems to speak volumes for itself. Every room of that house is unforgettable and a new kind of disturbing, ranging from the era's rising horror tropes to classic German expressionism. Why no other horror movie house's have captured the spirit of this one is beyond me.What Tobe Hooper has created is nothing short of timeless. For as many actors who have gone on to portray "Leatherface", Gunnar Hansen's performance still remains the most iconic. By the time we meet all of the family members, any means of sensibility are removed from the picture. You yourself are stuck with these emotionless psychopaths for a finale so simple, it effectively elevates any expectation you had. In some sick way, it's pretty fantastic to see a chainsaw dance.Final Verdict: I've seen many horror films of the 1970's, and so rarely is anything as good as "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre". Watch it and you'll understand. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who will survive and what will be left of them? (And why do such blood-thirsty killers as this lot seem to have no taste for even kinky sex?) I think we all know this one's story, inside-out and backwards, but in a nutshell - Young, hippie-ish adults on a happy outing in rural Texas quickly meet their deaths, 1-2-3, at the hands of a deranged "family" of cannibals. The women suffer the worst and Sally eventually meets "Grandpa" and gets the royal treatment. (All wrapped up with an ending that makes you wonder why it took 12 long years for the sequel to finally arrive) The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is brutal, shocking, and very effective low-budget horror from 1974. Considering all of the butchering that goes on in this film, it's surprising how little blood is actually spilled before the viewer's eyes.Now 40 years old, this one picture alone has certainly earned its cult status for literally being the one to start a ferocious trend in the genre of horror which still continues to thrive to this very day.*Note* - Oftentimes unintentionally laughable, if you choose to judge The Texas Chainsaw Massacre by today's rigid standards of over-the-top gore &amp; horror, then any thrills or enjoyment in what this pre-CGI horror film has to offer will be completely lost on you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal forever and always a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a legendary horror classic that did great business, inspired many and changed horror cinema forever. Certain details of the film are inspired by WI serial killer and necrophile Ed Gein, such as furniture made out of human remains and the mask made out of human skin that Bubba aka Leatherface wears. Other than that TTCM is a work of horror fiction. A family of freaks that robs graves,stalks, kills and eats people hunts five hippies that are visiting a family gravesite. While The Texas Chainsaw Massacre made a lot of money, it was made for little money. Even so, everything that was done here works and is taken very seriously. The gritty realism goes a long way in selling the story and the performances are so good, raw and totally unhinged. The score by Tobe Hooper and Wayne Bell sets the bleak tone for the film. While TTCM is notorious for being a violent film, there is little blood shed or gore. The right tone, atmosphere, disturbing images and great performances make the film work. Even without the gore the film is brutal and few films can touch this classic and evoke fear and terror that was done here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly stream-of-consciousness review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The filmmakers' use of ambient noises only, the deliberately slow pacing, and the nearly first-person perspective make us, from the first scene, the building of a grotesque human scarecrow in the cemetery, forget that we're watching a movie, and we soon feel like we're standing in that cemetery, and a character in this van ride through hell on a hot summer day, as nothing more than passive observers along for the ride. We hear and see exactly what the characters see and hear. When they pause to pick up Dracula, we're just as unnerved by him as they are. When he tries to set the van on fire, we hear the same sizzling noises and crackling fire they do, not a distracting music score.When they find the gas station with the old man at work, we're tricked, just like they are, into thinking that we're not alone and that everything will be all right. We even learn our destination: wheelchair boy's parents' farmhouse.But after we arrive at the farmhouse, our hopes are quashed as we find nothing but an abandoned building. There is no melodramatic build-up to showing the house, it just appears to us, the viewers, as it does to the characters in the film as they arrive there: a roadside building, overgrown with trees, bushes, and climbing vines. "Oh, I wish they hadn't let the place fall apart!" "Now it looks like the birthplace of Bela Lugosi!" It's pitch black inside, even when it's burning in the midday summer sun. Hope of a swim in a nearby lake to cool off is quickly obliterated, as the lake is now an open field. "If I have any more fun today, I don't think I'll be able to take it!" Again we're tricked into a false sense of security and hope, as we spot a house in the distance. Gasoline? People? A sanctuary? Hardly. Another house burning under the same sun. Oddly, this house is brighter than the first house. Quite odd, considering the horrors littered inside this second house; human bones and animals, some dead, some still alive. But the two characters that witness these things won't get to tell their tale.It's nightfall now. Where are their friends? Over the hills and far away, through tangled vines, trees, and bushes, to the lake where they went. And to the old house near it. And the unimaginable horrors inside it, only barely glimpsed before they were.....Brilliant suspense/ comic/ mockumentary/ horror/ exploitation fare draws us in from minute one and doesn't let us go. Again, through its deliberately slow pacing in the early scenes, the lack of any proper musical score, and the low-budget, gritty photography, we soon forget that we're watching a movie, and feel almost like we're another character in the van, in the house full of unnamed, unknown killers, like "Hitchhiker", and "Old Man". In this slaughterhouse. At the dinner table, just in time for "dinner".The morning after, we break out of the "window in hell" and run for our lives in the rising sun, and as the killer does his little dance of death with a buzzing chainsaw in the first light of morning.People remember this as being a violent, gory horror because the real horror is mostly implied, which lets the viewers imagine, and falsely remember seeing violence and bloodshed.Its low budget ($83000) is an asset: it makes the film look grittier and more graphic, without being overly gory. But since the filmmakers were competent in what they were doing, it does not seem inept and amateurish.Its slightly grainy photography and not-tack-sharp sound are assets, it gives the film a documentary look.No-name cast is an asset: everyone is expendable and we don't know who (if anyone) will survive.No proper musical score is an asset: it gives the film a cinéma vérité feel. A proper music score would be distracting, and greatly lessen the film's effect.The fact that some people still incorrectly think that this film is based on a true story shows how well written and presented it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now just to clear things up - when I saw this movie for the first time - I did not think anything of it as far as an opinion goes. I found Leatherface's kills horribly repetitive and misleading in terms of the title (What could I expect from the title "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"). No matter where I looked I saw people cite this movie as amazing and it got to the stage where I thought "Am I missing something here?" so I decided to give it a second chance.First of all I thought scenes were a little bit more off-putting this time round (eg, the scene with the hitchhiker). I also thought things were a lot more atmospheric this time round. The dinner scene is a classic example. Although as far as slasher films go I prefer Halloween and Black Christmas.I will watch the sequel, but I am not going to expect much, since the first one had to have 2 viewings for me to get into it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Retains its status as a horror classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Co-writer / director Tobe Hooper's landmark and extremely influential rural shocker is the quintessential unrelenting nightmare, a movie that grabs you early on and never lets go.One of a handful of movies to derive inspiration from the activities of the real-life Ed Gein, it deals with a group of young adults who visit the homestead of a grandfather to two of them, only to find out that some of the local residents are a grave robbing family of cannibals who proceed to terrorize these unfortunate young schmucks.As has been said, the power of the movie comes from the fact that it doesn't really *show* much of a massacre. The body count is respectable, but we never *see* weapons come into contact with flesh that often, or very much blood. Hooper and company lay on the thick and sweltering atmosphere in a movie that perfectly captures the utter desolation of its Texas locations. They firmly cemented the chain saw as an iconic weapon in the genre, and did the same for the memorable Leatherface character, played with true physical presence by Gunnar Hansen, who also gives him a human element by making him both childish and not terribly bright.After a slow and steady build up, the tension is cranked up more and more until the movie starts hammering away at its audience in the same way that its Final Girl, Sally (excellent screamer Marilyn Burns) is terrorized. It gives all of us a palpable "you are there" feeling; its immediacy is such that it's impossible to completely distance ourselves from the madness taking place on screen. It places its worst horrors right in our brains; we can *feel* a hook penetrate a body even though it's not explicitly shown. Beginning with ominous narration by a then unknown John Larroquette, it soon gives us a taste of what's to come with the use of some gruesome imagery. The soundtrack merely adds to the authentic feel without ever distracting from it. The acting from all concerned is effective, although many fans often hold up Paul A. Partain's paraplegic character of Franklin as a prime example of an annoying horror movie character. Kudos really goes to the four actors playing the murderous family: Hansen is great, as is the lovable Jim Siedow as the schizophrenic Cook, John Dugan as the decrepit grandfather, and the hilarious Edwin Neal as the Hitchhiker, who adds much of the humour to the production. "I think we just picked up Dracula", quips Franklin when he and his companions give the Hitchhiker a ride. Deserving of much praise is the art direction by Robert A. Burns, who gives the home of the cannibals some of the best macabre decorations ever to be seen in the genre. Best of all is the incredibly intense climactic "dinner" scene, which is kind of an assault on the senses. The movie has been much imitated over the years, but never equalled.Followed 12 years later by "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"; Lou Perryman, who played L.G. in that film, was the assistant cameraman here. Three other sequels would come after that, as well as the subsequent remake and its own prequel. None of them, though, have the impact of this initial effort.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Terrifying! One Of The Greatest Rides In Horror Movie History!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just can't bring myself to give this movie a perfect 10. There's not much reason for that. It's possibly the best movie of this type I have ever seen. It just seems too outlandish and too over the top to give it a perfect score. And yet, at times (and for a good part of the last half hour or so) this movie isn't just frightening - it's downright terrifying. Director (and co-writer) Tobe Hooper did a marvellous job of building this from a quiet and almost slow beginning (which was effective in and of itself) into a movie that causes you to squirm, wince and turn away on a regular basis - and he does it all with the use of fear rather than gore, because there's actually surprisingly little gore involved in this. This movie is about terror - pure, primal terror, absolutely superbly depicted by actress Marilyn Burns, who played Sally, who's the last of the main characters to meet "the family." Her performance and moreso her depiction of terror is absolutely chilling.As I said, the movie starts slowly. A narrator actually begins, reading words that are already displayed as white letters on black background. What could be more everyday and even pedestrian as that. The narration gives this a cold, perhaps dull, and definitely "documentary" feel. The opening scenes are creepy rather than frightening - a graveyard has been desecrated; corpses interred and dismembered - but no explanation as to why or by whom. Five young people come on the scene. Travelling in a van they chat about life - and a lot about horoscopes. Capricorn is being captured by Saturn, or some such astrological mumbo-jumbo, but we get the point - things are out of whack in the cosmos, and something bad is going to happen. Picking up a weird hitch-hiker along the way, the five are introduced to this strange family of psycho cannibals, and the terror ensues. The first appearance of the killer makes you jump, and ultimately leads to a last half hour that is absolutely riveting, and no less exhausting as we watch Sally desperately trying to escape from this madness that she's fallen into.I loved the ending to this. There are no loose ends tied up; and there's not going to be a dead killer coming back to life. In the end, the terrified Sally simply escapes in the back of a pickup truck while her chainsaw wielding pursuer runs after her and then, having given up, waves the chainsaw around madly. Sally is left terrified. The movie ends abruptly, but somehow you're left satisfied that you've been taken on one of the great rides in horror movie history. Wow! (9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not So Much a Narrative as an Event.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When reports of rampant grave-robbing grip the state of Texas, Sally Hardesty (Marilyn Burns), her invalid brother Franklin (Paul A. Partain) and three of their friends (Allen Danziger, William Vail, Teri McMinn) visit a rural Texas cemetery to confirm that the Hardesty's grandfather remains undisturbed. On their way back, they stop by their family home. Their neighbors, however, are a family of murderous cannibals who can't resist a free meal."The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" doesn't tell a narrative story so much as it depicts a singular event with documentarian verisimilitude. The film expounds a great deal of effort creating an illusion of reality: opening with a dryly narrated title card assuring the audience of the coming events' authenticity, followed by camera flashes illuminating decayed corpses. Character comments, which extend beyond of the immediate socioeconomics of the plot, further grant a sense of realism to the film (such as the hitchhiker's comments about modernized slaughterhouse equipment putting workers out of jobs).For all of its positive qualities, however, "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" has not aged terribly well. It ultimately comes off as a better "film" than a "horror film." Despite its violent action and gritty realism, the film just isn't frightening to contemporary audiences (in much the same way that Tourneur's horror films are considered tame). The shocks aren't quite as shocking as they used to be and the suspense is essentially nonexistent. Most of the terror scenes are shot in brightly-lit daytime, often against a background of sunflowers. While this definitely serves the purpose of juxtaposing with the action of the film (in much the same way that having the killers be a close-knit family), it doesn't succeed in eliciting terror in the minds of the audience."The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is a notably important and influential horror film, one which certainly defined a decade of radical socioeconomic change. This is a must-see for students of both the horror genre and the history of American film. If you're looking for a gory good time filled with modern scares, however, the less cinematic remake might be a better choice than the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting idea, poorly executed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge horror fan, and a Slasher fan more than anything. I was told that this film was a "must see" for any Horror fan. This film was a let down.My first problem with it is of the acting, or rather the lack of it. The acting in this film is very bad for the most part. Their are a few good performances in it, Edwin Neal is very over the top as "The Hitchhiker" which you may like depending on your view on how an acting performance should be done, personally i am not a fan of it especially in Horror, and Allen Danziger as Jerry was decent. But almost all the rest are awful. Jim Siedow as "The Old Man" is quite possibly the worst performance of all time, and the rest of the teens are pretty awful.After watching the first twenty minutes of this film i thought i was going to dislike, due to bad acting it but being a Horror Nut i decided to finish it should so i could say "I watched the Texas Chainsaw Massarce" (apparently you cant call yourself a Horror Nut if you cant say that)and kept watching.My opinion then changed, after the first death (that of Kirk) which i thought was done very well. The strange noises leading to silence, the appearance of the killer, the crack on the skull and the slamming of the iron door (note you don't see what happens behind the door, therefore your mind starts to "think" of what might had happened) a very well done scene. However my opinion soon returned to it original thoughts. After the second death (or more accurately while the death is accuring) the film goes down hill. Terrible scene, Pam falls into a room full of bones. She then decides to remain calm for about thirty seconds and look around, giving the camera times to show the audience the room, and THEN after thirty seconds decides to start freaking out and making a lot of noise attracting the killer. Either make the teen a fool and start freaking out straight away or sensible and slowly, quietly and calmly exit the serial killers house. Jerry's death is also badly done. He enters the room in which Kirk and Pam were both killed, and though a teen was bashed over the head with a sledgehammer and cut up with a chainsaw, while another was hanged on a meat hook their is no evidence to suggest any violence accured there. No blood, no flesh nothing. Later on in the film after Sally escapes the house, a lorry stops to help her. The driver helps her get in and close the door before the killer can kill her with his chainsaw, but instead of just driving away what do... They decide to open the door on the other side of the lorry and go right back outside to the madman with the chainsaw.Overall this film was not only bad, but it was simply not scary. If this film scares you then you are obviously not the right type of person to watch Horror. The first death was well done but not scary, and all the others are just stupid. Even one of the last scenes when Sally is round the table with the whole family, which could of been quite an intense scene it is ruined by the acting.If you want a good realistic Horror film based on a real life killer, then watch either Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, or The Silence Of The Lambs. Both of which happen to be based on the same real life killer Ed Gein. The difference is that those film are brilliant and done very well. Psycho is possible the best Horror of all time, and neither of them are just Stupid Boy 1. "i'm going to check out this house" Stupid Girl 1. "Ok" "Stupid Boy 1 gets killed" Stupid Girl 1. "Hmm he has been gone along time i'll going to check the house out too" "Stupid Girl 1 gets killed" Stupid Boy 2. "They've been gone along time, i'm gonna check out that house too" "Stupid Boy 2 gets killed" Stupid Girl 2. "Let go check out that house too" Stupid Boy 3. "Okay!" As this film is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most overrated movie I ever watched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read numerous good rating about this movie. Horror is my favorite genre and I do watch a lot of horror movies. American, European, Korean, Japanese, you name it. I am very sorry to say, this one might be big hit in its own golden time, it looks not only poor but I am afraid to say "ugly" most of the time, specifically in 2nd half.I liked the first part, the character build up, the natural 70s American youth life. The mad hitch hiker was bizarre enough, the lone convenient store, lone house etc etc. The first lapse in tight editing was the first two murders. I don't want to reveal much, as I have no intension to spoil anything. But from the name you will guess that there has to be couple of murders. Tension could have been built much there. But all the characters were being told just to scream or call each other's name. In 2nd half, in my opinion, the dialogs are worst and cheap. The screams were excessive and unnecessary. Which could have produced some nail biting moments, because of poor acting and lame editing, created some pathetic funny sequences.Honestly speaking, you may give this a try, but then, don't set your expectation too high. When I saw the rating over 7, I was expecting something more than 6-6.5 (for old movies I always deduct 1-1.5 sentimental over rating, old is always gold, isn't it? Not to me, sorry). But I couldn't push it over 5. Only good thing is, it was short (1:20 hrs) and stops suddenly(thanks God!). Also, no body tried to throw any morals which is a breeze.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best horror film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is, quite simply, the best horror film of all time. It's the one film I've ever seen that's genuinely scared the sh*t out of me.5 kids (Kirk, Pam, Jerry, Franklin and Sally) breaking down on a road trip doesn't sound like a very original concept, but remember this film was the first to use this formula. After about 20 minutes of setting the scene (this is long enough to build the tension but not so long the audience gets bored waiting) the real action starts.Kill #1: When they discover the house Kirk enters alone, begins to look around, but before too long Leatherface jumps out from behind a door and beats him on the head with a sledgehammer. This kill always makes me jump, although admittedly not a foot out of my chair like the first time!Kill #2: Pam goes looking for Kirk (her boyfriend) and stumbles across a room filled with human bones. She runs out of the house but is caught by Leatherface on the porch and dragged back inside, where she is impaled on a meat hook hanging from the ceiling. While she is hanging there we see Kirk's body being dismembered by a chainsaw-wielding Leatherface. This is a pretty brutal kill, and my second favourite in the film.Kill #3: Jerry goes looking for Kirk and Pam, and discovers Pam in a freezer, still alive. While Jerry is trying to comfort her Leatherface reappears behind him and he receives a blow to the head form the sledgehammer. Leatherface then locks Pam back in the freezer. This is my least favourite, because it's the one you most see coming.Kill #4: When night begins to fall Sally starts to get worried and wheels Franklin (who is in a wheelchair) towards the house. As they approach Leatherface appears out of the trees and rams a chainsaw through his chest. This is my favourite kill from the film, because of the sheer brutality of it. You see Leatherface ramming the chainsaw into Franklin's chest for about 15 seconds.Sally then runs away and a long chase ensues, lasting for most of the last 3rd of the film. In the end Sally escapes after Leatherface falls over and cuts into his leg with the chainsaw. The final scene shows Leatherface dancing manically, waving the chainsaw round in front of the sunset.The chase leading up to Sally's escape is very tense, and Leatherface's crazy dance is my favourite scene from the whole film. I love the way Leatherface isn't shown to be crazy until right at the end of the film.It is an overall brilliant film, and inspired an entire sub-genre of 'slasher' films. I consider it to be one of the most influential films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No longer truly horrifying but still an interesting experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As one of the granddaddies of the modern horror genre, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre has aged surprisingly well. It can't match the extravagant gore of its descendants but it retains a captivating, almost mesmerizing quality.The plot is almost elemental. Five young people are driving through rural Texas in the summer of 1973. Sally Hardesty and her wheelchair-bound brother Franklin (Marilyn Burns and Paul A. Partain) have come out to see if a buried relative has been unearthed by grave robbers. Sally's boyfriend Jerry (Allen Danziger), as well as another couple named Kirk and Pam (William Vail and Teri Meminn), have come along to see the abandoned Hardesty homestead. All five end up running into a family of cannibals, including the chain saw wielding Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen). That doesn't work out too well for any of them, as you can probably guess from the movie's title.While it was beyond shocking for its day, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre isn't even as viscerally disgusting as any random episode of CSI or as sadistically violent as the average episode of 24. Whether that says something good or bad about American popular culture is a discussion for another day. But shorn of its sensory overload, you can recognize that this is a pretty well made film. It's very low budget, the dialog is nothing to write home about and Sally, Jerry, Pam and Kirk are all pretty generic victims. The crippled Franklin, though, is interesting. Instead of being the most victim-like of them all, he has a bit of depth. He's both the voice of reason that no one ever listens to and he represents the fascination with the strange and unknown that gets people into trouble. Leatherface and his family are also profoundly bizarre. Even now, after filmmakers have spent decades trying to top this movie, these cannibals remain genuinely creepy and unsettling because of the matter-of-fact way in which they're presented.Tobe Hooper's direction is the most noteworthy thing about this movie. It looks as good as any cheap movie ever can look and instead of relying on excessive close ups to grab the audience by the throat, Hooper shoots most of the scenes in the film at either middle or long distance. It creates a disturbingly voyeuristic feel to the story, like you're observing something that's really happening. Hooper also creates a couple of shots that are as iconic as anything in the horror genre - Leatherface slamming a steel door shut and Sally getting slashed by the Hitchhiker as she tries to run away. At those moments, your heart still beats a little faster, no matter how cynical and jaded you think you are.It's also fascinating to watch this progenitor of horror and witness the conventions of the genre being formed before your eyes. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre doesn't possess the sizzling rage and hate of The Last House on the Left and it only flirts with the ominous dread and suspense of Halloween. No, what this film contributed to the conventions of horror are the threat of unspeakable violence and a weird, macabre ridiculousness. The ideas a killer in a hockey mask or wearing a fedora and razor sharp fingers flow directly from a guy with a chainsaw, a butcher's smock and a face made of someone else's skin. This movie established the outlandish as one of the principal features of the horror movie.The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is more of a curiosity than a truly terrifying experience nowadays. It can't quite give you the thrills and chills of the modern horror movie, but it's still not something you want to watch when you're all alone late at night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a major horror film lover who owns over 100 horror films, but when I bought The Texas Chainsaw Massacre I was bored! Yes I can see where a lot of more modern horror films have stolen ideas from the original but to be quite frank I found the film very poor. I was not scared one bit! OK, you may say that it is a classic and that it was made in the 70s on a low budget but the actual storyline wasn't bad but the amount of 'horror' was below a good standard. I liked the idea of the main character "leatherface" however he was not presented as very scary compared to other films of that era. Instead of finding this film scary I actually thought it was more of a comedy! So for me the max I would give it is 5/10- it is only that high due to the plot. For actual horror it would be 2/10...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without a doubt, the best horror ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1974 was a groundbreaking year in history of cinema. Previously unknown director Tobe Hooper created with only about $83,000 budget shocking image, which for decades has became the brightest hallmark for all slasher films. And he didn't need any well-known actors nor spectacular special effects.The plot tells a story of the five friends travelling through Texas to their grandpa's old house. During a travel they pick up a suspicious hitch-hiker (which was quickly thrown out). In a short time friends are left alone in complete isolation among a family of cannibals.Film doesn't have extreme gore or scenes which leads you to jumping out of chair. So what is the biggest advantage of the film? Atmosphere. Stifling, morbid and paranoid atmosphere. The feeling of terror has never been so real. Every aspect of 'Massacre' is filled with eerie and horrible emotions. Scenography including the real human skeleton, creepy dark ambient music or acting of a main evil character set up a shocking nightmare in which no one ever wants to be find.Main character Leatherface is the subject of separate discussions. Retarded butcher wearing a mask made of human skin. Gunnar Hansen who played him added to an already frightening character more terror. The scene of his dance with a chainsaw is together beautiful and disturbing.It's a pity that Tobe is making now garbage like 'Mortuary' or 'Crocodile', and he won't probably get close to a greatness of his masterpiece .It is hard to write something new that nobody knows, everything I can tell is that The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a film that you should see before you die. You will never forget it...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Carlsberg made horror films . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apologies for the tag line, but The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is, quite probably, the best horror film in the world.Forget the script on this one, forget the camper van that's out of petrol, forget even the crazy old man in the opening ten minutes, and just concentrate on the growing sense of menace which Tope Hooper brings to the screen, under the veneer of a blazing hot Texan sky.Van Gogh said orange was the colour of insanity. Well I think the soundtrack to this film is very possibly the SOUND of insanity. The screeches, the claustrophobic wailing, the sense that somebody is doing something nasty just off camera . . . it's almost like being in an abattoir (or what I imagine being in an abattoir is like).This is one of the few films I've seen where you almost feel you can touch the picture, or even smell it. There is something palpable about what is being shown up on the screen. Tobe Hooper manages to convey a sense of realism which has rarely been reached before.When one of the boys opens the screen door of the farm and calls out Hello . . . There is an utter silence. The only thing I think you can hear are the flies. Insects are shown in huge close-up, the hum of wasps sounds fleetingly like a blast of stereo. Even the long dry grass out in the back yard has a faintly eerie look to it as Sally and her friends stop off to look for petrol.To be bluntly honest there is nothing new about the storyline. Five kids lost in a strange place has been a staple of horror for as far back as anyone can remember. What lifts this film above just about every other picture in the genre is the sheer presence of the film.For those reared on a diet of modern-day horror (ie Scream, I know What You Did Last Summer, Cabin Fever etc) do yourselves a favour when you've an hour or so to spare and watch what happened when Tope Hooper and his crew turned up in Texas back in 1974. This is the finest horror I have ever seen. It's got a minimal script and the characterisation may seem sparse to non-existent. It's worth noting though, the performance of Marilyn Burns as Sally Hardesty. It is hard to portray terror convincingly on screen. Very hard, in fact. Yet Burns at times seems almost to be losing her mind. Was that really acting we were watching, or was she just absolutely s@#* scared at what was happening to her?Such is the visceral power of this film it is not hard to see why Tobe Hooper clearly found it such a hard act to follow. Having seen his Poltergeist film which followed in the 1980s, you can only speculate that his producers reined in the huge talent which was on display here in order to make Poltergesit more acceptable for a family audience.Making films like this must be exhausting. After watching it for the first time on television I was numb for several hours afterwards. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre isn't simply a horror film, it is THE horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What do the words "Crushing Disappointment" mean to you personally? Think about that one for a second. Certainly in your long list of disappointments, there is bound to be a new release film you saw that didn't fit the awesome-amazing-godly vision you anticipated in your head. However, reading reviews of older films, I rarely see this term used. If someone dislikes an older film, they say something like: "It's just the most overrated movie of all time." But very rarely do I ever see anyone have the audacity to say an older film is completely worthless, then give an intelligent reasoning for their opinion, even if they were completely disappointed with the older film. Maybe this is because we as a society have some sort of ludicrous respect for older films, even when they don't deserve it. Though I was not completely disappointed with The Texas Chain Saw Massacre?far from it?I will give intelligent reasoning as to why those blind-eyed by nostalgia need to realize this film has not aged in golden perfection. Also, I'll try to help those who were completely disappointed with this film to understand why it isn't total trash.Because I lived in a semi-sheltered household, I didn't grow up on horror movies. In my recent years, I count this as a blessing, because I can review films without any nostalgic bias whatsoever. Nostalgia is the problem with so many reviews I read of this movie. Someone who saw The Texas Chain Saw Mass cure at the age of 5 and went in their pants is going to grow up proclaiming to the masses that it is "THE scariest movie of all time!" While, in opposite, a 20-year-old man viewing the film for the first time is going to say that "Hostel was more terrifying than this cheesy crap!" because Hostel is more modern and he can relate to it more. It's all a matter of perspective. Personally, I didn't see anything scary about this movie whatsoever. I can, however, see how someone would think that. Just because something is old and was effective to an older audience does not mean it's effective to a modern audience. If you want to live in absurd denial that The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is the scariest movie of all time, no exceptions, then may I ask who is being more immature: you, or the "kids" you claim no nothing about horror? In the opposite spectrum, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is in the top 5 most important horror films of all time, like it or not. That isn't an opinion. In its time, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was a purely original idea, and to this day there has never been a film like it. While some will argue that it's far "inferior" to the "superior" remakes, they fail to see that the original was far more groundbreaking. The remakes strayed from the original plot and pumped it full of clichés. The original The Texas Chain Saw Massacre gave built a far more complete atmosphere and refused to explain any of the events that transpired in the film, except in the opening monologue. This is a far more original form of storytelling, and, to me, and most other people, is far more effective. It is inarguably more realistic.But what The Texas Chain Saw Massacre doesn't have is flawless production value. Compared to movies today, this is almost like watching an indie YouTube video. The production value has aged, and it's important to understand that. Hooper's directing is still very technical and well-done, but that just can't blot out the deeply aged edge. For example, it's very obvious that Hooper was trying to shoot for a PG-rating initially. The lack of on-screen gore is very annoying at times, because by today's standards, it's incredibly tame, even if it was on-screen. Also, the acting from the secondary characters is very unbelievable, even laughable, at points. I personally can appreciate all this lack of polish, because it's far more unsealing than the clean-cut politically-correct remakes.Overall, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre may not hold up to the blockbuster status, but it doesn't have to. It wasn't meant to. It was one of the first examples of pure, raw, anti-stylistic intensity captured on film. That's what its legacy is built around. That's why The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was so important in its time.Like it or not, find it cheesy or unnerving, find it scary or laughable, you can't deny that the film still has something that very few other movies?modern or not?don't have. Intensity. Uncertainty. Confusion. Originality. Even if you find the film purely disappointing, can you name a whole lot of other horror movies that have these characteristics? I can count them on one hand. And The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is the granddaddy of them all.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Horror Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ten out of ten stars The original "Texas Chainsaw" is a cinematic masterpiece in every sense of the word masterpiece. It's turned into a benchmark of excellence that few other horror based film makers have been able to achieve. The recent remakes based of the original are border line insults and go to show just how brilliant the original "TCM" truly was. Of course 1974 was a different time; audiences had never experienced anything like "TCM", and while I wasn't in existence in 1974, I can only imagine how shocking this film was for audiences to view.The film is based on the real life Wisconsin grave robber and murderer Ed Gein who only murdered two people, but gained more notoriety by constructing household items and furniture out of human remains. Gein is also legend to have practiced cannibalism on the two victims he did murder. If you're not familiar with the Gein story, and you're into this "type" of thing, I strongly recommend you Google Gein and check into his story. "TCM", however, takes Gein's story to a whole new level of perversion, violence, and terror. "TCM" is unrelenting once the the terrifying chain of events begins. Five friends fall off course looking for their grandfather's abandoned house, and walk into into a nightmarish trap perpetuated by a family of insane fanatics. Believe me, once the action starts it doesn't let up and shows no mercy for the wandering friends, or the audience. I can only feel sorry for the younger generation of film goers, that have been numbed by Hollywood, who just don't appreciate or see the importance of this film."TCM" is a somewhat culturally outdated film but is extremely well produced, considering that it was shot in about a month for very little money. The recent "TCM" remakes, with huge budgets and lengthy shooting periods, can't even hold a candle to the original. What does that tell you? It should tell you that big budgets and studio involvement mean nothing when it comes to producing quality films. What matters is that the film is, at it's core, a good story; and that the producer and director care more about the film than any form of monetary gain. The cinematography, however grainy it may be, is stunning at times and has the tendency to in itself evoke dark emotions on the part of viewers. All the actors put so much effort into this film and it shows, the acting IS above average on all counts. The sound score is evil, I couldn't imagine the film without it. All things considered, "TCM" is a very well made film. I know it's easy for ignorant film goers to pick "TCM" apart because of it's age and it's budget, but IT IS a quality film in every respect. "TCM" is Tobe Hooper's greatest achievement as a director and should be seen by anyone that considers themselves to be a fan of the horror genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best horror movie of all times.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas chainsaw massacre is, in my opinion, the best horror movie ever and I'd like to see if I can tell why in few words and a foreign language. What did Tobe Hooper do to achieve such a perfect movie it's what i often wonder. I'm sure the realistic look the film has it's the base of it all, the photography is truly natural, no lights are positioned to give an image of threat nor there are creepy sound-tracks warning you that something bad is going to happen. The day, afternoon and night are not stormy, there are not eerie lightning , the house of the Sawyer family it's quite a regular country house ,of course inside they already redecorated it whit them particular taste, but that's totally believable because it is the doing of mad men. In fact there is a reason on why the house decoration and the character of Leather-face strike as totally original and believable and that is because they where conceived by maybe one of the most deranged man of all times, the psycho supreme, the Plainfield Wisconsin butcher, Mr. Ed Gein. For those unfamiliar whit the name he was the famous serial killer whose "work" inspired Robert Bloch writer of the novel "Psycho" and Tomas Harris creator of the Hannibal Lecter trilogy "Red Dragon" "Silence of the lambs" and of course "Hannibal". Yes ,one man alone. So even the most horrible facts of the movie are based on true events. Plus the actors that played the young victims did an outstanding job in the movie. The academy owes actress Marilyn Burns an Oscar for her performance, she screams and cry in such a way that the horror she is feeling is contagious. She makes you feel the madness she witness whit those screams, she and the other victims where surely a big part in making the movie as realistic as possible. The movie in resume was filmed in a way that showed pretty much how would it look if any of us had the dubious honor of being invited at dinner by the Sawyer family. The unreal it's a factor that may seem ideal to help a movie being scary but it has to be carefully dosed or the thing would seem unlikely to actually happen. That is something that Hooper knew by instinct. He mastered those limits. Well i think it's enough since i am having a headache trying to express my feelings in a language i do not know to well, so I'll try not to give you one by reading more of this pour English. Though i hope i have made my point clear even if i feel i could never explain in words how much i love this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated horror, yet more believable than the better remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie having already seen the 2003 remake (and its 2006 prequel) beforehand.This movie is obviously considered a classic of horror cinema, by fans and critics alike, while opinion on the remake is divided, some believing it competent while others despising it.The two movies are actually very different, despite sharing many similar elements, both in terms of story and stuff on screen. Here you have a group of buddies who run out of gas somewhere in Texas and who go check out the childhood home of two of them while waiting for the gas station to get refueled. One-by-one, they stumble onto a house where Leatherface proceeds to take care of them.A lot of people praise this film for its technique of not actually showing anything, making it that much more powerful. The thing is this was not due to artistic choice, but rather lack of budget. I'm not at all an advocate of "more gore is better" but I can't say I appreciated the demonstration of terror in this movie, which basically consisted in a whole lot of screaming and extreme close-ups of the actors' faces. So if you're looking for actual cool scenes, the remake is the way to go.That being said, Tobe Hooper's film is also more realistic and believable than Marcus Nispel's, from the reason the teens are stranded to Leatherface's house (it actually looks normal from the outside, somewhere you actually would go knock at the door to ask a question). Also the 70s teens in this movie are obviously much better at playing teens from the 70s than Jessica Biel and her buddies (the remake could easily have been set in the present day, you wouldn't know the difference).It's pretty amazing that the same cinematographer worked on both films considering how different they look. Obviously 30 years separate the two films and the remake had a much bigger budget, but still... All in all, while the remake is better looking, cooler and a more pleasant viewing experience (at least for me), the original is more believable and has a better storyline and better characters.I guess it's good for what it is, but I feel it's quite overrated. Of the other teen slasher-type films from the 70s/80s which I've seen (Halloween and Friday The 13th), I enjoyed this the least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ultimate exercise in the power of suggestion, Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a brilliantly shot and excellent handled work, a great example of how to make a horror film on a low budget. Evoking the Post-Vietnam fears of American society at the time, such as the energy crisis and fear of the unknown, Hooper sets up the perennial horror film aesthetic of the 1970's, that of the deconstruction of the nuclear family. In this case, the cannibal family, comprising of a group of disturbed ex-slaughterhouse workers feed off the fear of the travelling new age young make-shift hippie family of the time. Where they represent the old values of society that has lost much after the Vietnam war, the travelling new-age family represent a more liberal approach to a desperate economy and they are struck down by an everyday fear of the unknown and a villain that is representative of a new terror in society - the serial killer in this case, Leatherface - a personification of 1950's Wisconsin killer Ed Gein. Hooper uses this context to scare the crap out of audiences living in paranoia of the time, and he handles the scenario with detailed precision, directing with an uneasy, nerve-jangling, documentary style. Shot on 16mm the film has a dark, grainy effect and brilliant, immaculately shot compositions and this only adds to the films raw power and makes it all the more disturbing. If your looking for a mindless, entertaining gore flick look elsewhere, this a masterful, intelligent, socially conscience and historically significant work of art and terror.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Horror Movie Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie many times on VHS but couldn't remember it clearly so last week, I purchased it on DVD for ?5 and the least I can say is money well spent! This movie is a true great in the horror genre. The plot is clever, the characters are likable and the most frightening thing is, this is a true story! I have read the story of Ed Gein and this movie is hardly any different The ending was a bit silly and stupid but apart from that, This was awesome! Along with Halloween, Friday The 13th, A Nightmare On Elm Street and The Exorcist, this movie is a classic! I hope to see the remake now, but I'm just hoping I'm not disappointed!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>oh man, this an excellent movie!!! i had seen the remake of it and i had enjoyed it a lot, now i decided to check the original version and this movie rocks!!! it's sooooooooooooooooooooooooo cool and 70's!!! oh man oh man oh man!!! OK, back to reality!!! =D there's some gore here but quite light... bloody scenes are not that bloody on my opinion, but still it's a great terror atmosphere for a movie with almost 35 years!!! the best scenes of the movie are undoubtedly the dinner scene... it's beautiful!!! and the last chase of leatherface to the girl ends up on such a great scene as it is the "dance of the chainsaw"... oh man, i was delighted with that scene!!! you will notice it is a quite well designed movie, but the resources that existed in '74 didn't allow one to create many more things... the family's dad has the most criminal and psycho smile ever, he can ever beat his weirdo-blades-lover son!!! you can see his immense joy on the killing spree when they are at table... about grandpa and grandma... i thought they were dead... grandpa then appeared and i noticed he was already little bit zombie, but well... the main actress... well, if she's not on Guinness book for the longest, scariest and gory screams in a movie, she should be!!! she's awesome!!! i'm a great metal fan and some metal guys look like kindergarten girls next to her... :O she plays an excellent role, u can feel her huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge fear in every scream!!! man, that was real voice cords massacre!!! the other characters deaths unfortunately were not that bloody, but well, what the heck, it's a great movie!!! my advice is to check this one and the remake, both are excellent, but this is (was already at the time) a natural born classic!!! gets 9 out of 10!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Slasher Film, But I Was A Little Disappointed(SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSTexas Chainsaw Massacre was one of the many movies that I was dying to see. I loved the title of it, it sounded so gritty and violent. Finally I got to see it. It was an amazing film. I mean, it was one of the first slasher films. Although it was an awesome film I can not feel but a little disappointed. They talk too much and there is a lot of boring scenes. By the way, this is so not a Holiday film, it can be anything but it can not be a Holiday film.The plot is pretty simple. A group of college students in the middle of Texas are eventually killed by a family of Cannibals. There are five students. Two girls, three boys. Wow, actually more boys than girls. How odd. Anyway, eventually of being impaled on meat hooks and hit by sledgehammers, there are only a brother and a sister left. Then the brother is killed by man in a leather mask with a chainsaw. He is obviously called Leatherface. He captures her. She escapes and gets into a back of a truck and it drives off, saving her life. Leatherface is really mad. She is also very mad, but in a totally different way.Overall, this is a fantastic film. It is a little boring at times and is not as good as I expected, but it is still a great film. If you are a fan of slasher films, you got to have this. There is one thing I would like to point out, the acting in this film is not the best acting I have seen. Anyway, this is a really great slasher film that I know fans of slasher films would like.8/10Recommended Films: Halloween, Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street, and Scream.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the beginning of Texas chainsaw massacre you know you are going to be scared beyond belief,this was released about a year after the exorcist,its loosely based on the story of real life killer and cannibal ed gein from Wisconsin.but this is a whole family of twisted psychos in Texas that prey on some teens traveling through Texas.like Halloween most of the horror is suggested.not a lot of blood and guts but it will really give you nightmares.so many remakes and sequels but this one is by far the best.Tobe hooper and Kim henkel made this on a low budget and was bought by new line cinema.the first time i saw this was during its re-release in 1984.Texas chainsaw massacre is a classic horror film like Halloween,the exorcist and night of the living dead.when critic Rex reed reviewed this movie he called it the most disgusting movie ever made,i guess it scared him.this movie was imitated so many times it makes you wonder,is imitation the best form of flattery?the imitations include;wrong turn,cabin fever,and even the 2005 release house of wax.gunner Hanson is credible as leather face the demented chainsaw wielding maniac who wears a human face as a mask to cover his deformed face.Marilyn burns as one of the victims of the lethal family. the Texas chainsaw massacre is a milestone movie imitated but never equaled.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

Leatherface the dad and the hitchhiker are the unholy trinity. any director that remakes classic horror films should first study their subject matter and fully evaluate the ramifications of their actions. what i mean is if it ain't broke then don't try to fix it. think about it would you remake a new hope or Goodfellas or raging bull? some things are sacred and Hollywood just doesn't understand that. what else can i say? if you've ever been scared by a movie you know what i'm saying. Jessica Biel notwithstanding the remake was a total piece of s#!t. remaking classic films is mental masturbation!! in summary i believe that there are certain classic movies that aren't considered classics yet said movies deserve that status and respect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that the reason that this movie is so scary is the fact that it is filmed like a documentary. In that way, the movie seems like it really happened. This is one of the scariest movies that I have ever watched. It starts out with a nice drive in the country to visit an old house and it ends up with a blood splattering massacre.They call it 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' because Leatherface chases her with a chainsaw. The chainsaw is his trademark and he didn't just use it on Jerry. He also used it to chop up Kirk after he had died.Anyway, the family must saved a lot of money on furniture because the couch and the chairs are made out of human bones. Plus, I loved the music in this movie because it was great.Watch this movie! It's gonna be a fun trip and you'll have so many scares, you won't be able to take it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the remake of this movie before I saw the original and became curious to see the differences between the two. Well, I had heard a lot about how frightening and disturbing it was. So I saw it-actually I bought it-and to tell you the truth, I was disappointed. Other people may have liked this movie and I have nothing against their opinion, but it was a bit slow for my taste, and by the end it got pretty annoying. I don't want to spoil anything for those that have not seen it yet and may like it so I'll just tell you that there is a lot of high pitched screaming and dizzying images, but as I said before, that part is closed to the end. I actually can't believe I sat through this thing completely, and thats not because it was scary, but because it gave me a headache. People usually say that the original was the best but in my opinion that's not the case with The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never felt so drained as I did the first time I saw this movie. I spent less than 90 minutes being pummeled and bludgeoned--kinda like how that captive girl must have felt when grandpa impotently beat her with a mallet. Tobe Hooper's masterpiece is not as chilling as Halloween or as intelligent as Dawn of the Dead (or Night of the Living or Day of the Dead for that matter) or as funny as An American Werewolf in London, but it represents one of the finest achievements in American horror cinema. The whole thing exudes amateurism, from the quasi-artistic camera angles (you're trying too hard, Tobe) to the limited range of the actors. The photography is excellent (sun scorched, washed-out, and magnificent--I can taste the dust) and Tobe's control of camera movement are incredible, though--especially from a young filmmaker. I dare Scorsese to make anything as brilliantly disorienting as the chase through the briar patch. The only other filmic moment to which I can compare it is the closing minute of Herzog's Aguirre, as the the camera spirals into madness around the title character. Those points of perfection help us ignore the more immature aspects of the film. So too does Hooper's ability to simply wear down his audience. This film is grueling to watch--and that's the point. Coming at the end of the Vietnam War (I don't think the last plane had yet to leave Saigon), this was a film made by individuals who had watched the horror of My Lai and seen the devastation of Napalm. They had watched their friends come home disturbed when they came home at all. The country had just gone through a "national nightmare." The kids at Kent State were dead, as was the idealism that had sparked the Civil Rights Movement, the Moonshot, and the Counterculture. America was in shambles. The Texas Chansaw Massacre takes all the pain and suffering and pukes it back at us. This isn't a stunning film because we see young kids getting sliced and diced; it stuns us because we see ourselves there--what we as a country have been through. I don't know if Tobe intended any of that. Nevertheless, the filmmakers were disaffected, young, angry, and beaten down. It only makes sense that their movie shares a similar sense of weariness and desolation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Horror Movie Ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just wanted to put out there that I personally think that the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre was by far the best horror movie ever. I remember when i was a kid all the other kids trying to convince each other that the movie's premise was based on a real family here in Texas..and since I am from Texas and live there still it seemed very feasible at the time..which made the movie that much better..lol.It seems to be able to convey a sense of death and gore without making you watch it..you get the hee-bee-gee-bees without having to see actual guts..thanks so much to Mr.Hooper for this classic.Would also like to comment that the remake was a nice piece of film but for different reasons...it seems that there were some eerie and dark qualities to the second one but they did not live up to the original.Also,I wanted to point out that if you liked this movie you might want to check out both The House of a 1,000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects...the latter is the best out of the two but both are pretty good..thanks diana</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll be 32 on September 12, 2005 and amazingly I just saw the original TCM for the very first time.As a kid I remember my two older brothers talking about the movie, and I understood it was a revered horror film. A cult classic of the genre.Something about the grittiness I guess.Anyways, I did see the remake and though I thought it had some decent elements, and I picked out the scene of the slaughterhouse which Rob Zombie incorporated into House of 1000 Corpses, and I felt Jessica Biel was great especially with the boy over the piano scene... that was really nicely acted... i wasn't overly impressed just because I felt the scenes were set up in a very unrealistic manner.So now watching the original the first thing I note was how it set up the mood. The atmosphere, the interesting camera angles and use of motion with the wind and the grasses. I found that to be very nicely done.The killings of the original are set up just as unrealistically though, what with Kirk walking into the house, tripping right into Leatherface.We could say as a young punk he is the sort that likes to be sneaky, heck i was sneaky growing up too, so it's not completely unrealistic him going into the stranger's house uninvited.Then the girl follows him in, now that IS realistic. It makes sense why she would go in, because now she is wondering where he went.The way he hangs her on the hook, so matteroffact, that was really eloquently done, mainly because it was not overdone, and unassuming, and yet so many movies have been inspired by this movie it's hard not to give this movie credit for how it so unabashedly pushed the envelope for it's day.The movie was definitely not scary though. Leatherface makes such quick work of his victims, so the movie is not gory, or frightening, or tense, just kinda weird.I can imagine seeing this in the theaters back in 74 must've been pretty scary though, these days we have a few thousand more horror movies under our belts that we are more desensitized by horror, since horror has pushed the envelope so far since TCM first came out.In all fairness that is.The scene at the dining table was a bit overdone, the closeup camera angles on the eyes and screams and such kinda went on and on and on and felt a little contrived.Having the dead grandpa hitting her with the hammer was pretty cool.Oh and if Marilyn Burns reads this review you were a cutie in this movie. Wearing those white bell bottoms, like a beacon in the darkness.Poor Sally, running through the woods, arms a flailing, screeching like a banshee from hell, jumping outta windows all over the place, running into dead guys, just not having a great day but such a cutie! .Leatherface dancing around at the end reminded me a lot of how the attorney acted in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas... funny thought.Great ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film which you are about to see is not true...but very amazing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all those who think this film was based on a true story, that's false. Hooper's idea was to make a whole family of Ed Gein-like characters, but all the events are completely fictitious.---==BIG SPOILERS AHEAD==--- I'll have to be honest...the first time I saw this movie, I was disappointed. Maybe because it was not what I expected, but each time seeing it since, I have grown to love it twice as much as the last time. I'd personally rank it in my top 5 favorite horror movies, and top 10 favorite films of all time.This movie is a success in many ways. One is that nobody can duplicate it and it's desired effect. This film was made on a tiny budget with totally inexperienced actors and many of the crew as well. But that never stopped it from influencing practically every horror film that came after it.The directing...excellent. Especially when considering what they had to work with and the conditions they were working in. Several beautiful shots, like the under-the-swing tracking shot, and Leatherface pulling Pam into the house from the front porch IN BROAD DAYLIGHT. As you can tell, this movie is made without remorse. Nobody is safe and no place is safe. Not even a beautiful and innocent young girl in the bright Texas sun. Not even a helpless cripple in a wheelchair. Not even the audience.There's a very extended sequence in the final third of the film in which the character Sally is kidnapped and strapped to a chair made from human bones and forced to eat dinner with this completely psychotic family. During this scene, we almost literally see her go insane. And speaking of characters, special mention must be given to Franklin, who is the most believably annoying character I have ever seen. He's also crippled, and confined to a wheelchair. Near the end of the film, he gets attacked by Leatherface and sawed to death. Would ANYBODY have the balls to film a scene like that today? Never.Another thing that I must mention is how Tobe Hooper slowly brings the movie from a seemingly peaceful yet questionably strange setting to one of complete and total insanity...and make it work. You'd think Hooper himself wasn't playing with a full deck. But when watching a movie with the title The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, what else would you expect? One thing you wouldn't have guessed is that this movie is essentially free of gore, sex, nudity, and strong profanity. The title is actually very misleading.The movie starts with a decaying body being photographed (along with the most un-nerving sound effect EVER), two other corpses tied to a tombstone, a dead animal on the side of the road, etc. So right from the start, you kind of know what you're in for. But who could have ever expected to see an ending like the one in the movie? The grandfather, who can barely move, is trying to bludgeon Sally to death while the rest of the family watches. Sally escapes and runs away during sunrise while the hitchhiker follows closely from behind, cutting her with a straight razor. Sally reaches a road and the hitchhiker is crushed by a truck in a very brutal scene. Sally, now covered in blood, runs from Leatherface (as does the truckdriver). Sally hops into the back of a pick-up truck and is driven away, laughing with hysterical insanity. And what makes it believable apart from the great acting, is that from the start, she's the least likely character you'd see like that. So before the movie ends, Leatherface is dancing in the middle of the road wearing a suit and tie and twirling his chainsaw around in circles, first thing in the morning. Who the hell thought of that? I'd also like to make special mention of the excellent audio commentary on the DVD (I have the Pioneer special edition with the original cover art, not sure if the commentary is different on subsequent releases). Very informative, especially about the working conditions and how much everyone really suffered, Marylin Burns in particular...jumping off a house, getting cut for real, falling on concrete repeatedly, filthy rag in her mouth, broom stick beatdowns, etc. But the commentary is also very funny, believe it or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember the video box when I was a kid. It taunted you. It was so frightening that it dared you to rent it. On the box was a Rex Reed quote that expressed it has "Horrifying";along with a big,fat guy with a chainsaw!When I was 12, I bought the VHS tape and watched it with my still-current best-friend, who had to call his mom and go home after viewing this horror-masterpiece. I was in love with this film. Still am. It is the rawest, sweatiest, and most disgusting depiction of physical and emotional terror ever expressed on film. It's in you're face from frame one. It wont let up. Jason was a one-note retard in 1988. Freddy was already shitting out 007-esque one-liners, and Michael Myers,a stiff ,was trapped in some "plot-crap" in 1988. Leatherface wanted you to experience true insanity before he barbecued you, while sporting your boyfriend's face(literally). This was, well "horrifying" stuff. Tobe Hooper is insane; This film is proof. Oh yeah, it's funny too. A great film, not just a great horror film. enjoy</fullReview>

The greatest strength of TCM is not the plot, script, or acting, but the atmosphere of sheer, nightmarish dread that seeps from the grainy film and gets under your skin... this is why it has stood the test of time and why it is considered a horror classic.Perhaps some viewers have been too jaded by the countless imitations of this movie to understand its original impact, but make no mistake... this is the real deal, the one that started it all. With an obviously limited budget, Tobe Hooper and his cast and crew took what could have been a forgettable drive-in flick and produced a minor masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With almost no blood or simular things, this film manages to be scary in another way. The shocking brutality and the amazing Gunnar Hansen ( Leatherface ) makes this movie one of the best ever. It shock'd me in a way no other movie ever had, and it still does. It's amazing how Tobe Hooper has managed to make this movie so real and terrifying with that directing. He was still learning during this film, but it stands as my favourite of the man. Anyways, if you are looking for a scary and brutal movie, without a lot of blood and other shocking effects, check it out. You can find it on most internet-shops on DVD, and it's not expensive.

		<fullReview>This scared the be Jesus out of me. It really did. My maths teacher borrowed me it whilst it was still banned which is quite scary now come to think about it but he told me that film was a huge hype fest and didn't deserved to be banned at all. I took his word for it and watched it as soon as I got home and what a git he was because I was really terrified by it. It didn't make me jump or anything out of a Wes Craven movie, it just hit me right in the head and impounded my psychological state of mind.There are people out like the family in Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Maybe not cannibals and murderers but definitely as far as personality goes there are. I've come across people who are not all there which is what they are it's safe to say and have felt very uncomfortable on many occasions being around that kind of company because you can't relate to it. The amount of screaming that was yelled out by the young girl is more scary than a dozen Dracula's and Frankenstein's because those screams just get into your head and don't leave you and you can still hear it long after. My mum called me down to dinner after watching the film and I couldn't eat because of the way the film presented itself in a dirty sick in the head plot. The story was as straight forward as any story could ever go but that doesn't mean the film is going to be bad. The chain of events that happen in the film whether it will be crazy guy in the van who started to slice up the guy in the wheelchair to Leather face putting the young girl on a meat hook. The whole film just stayed with me for as long as I can remember. A friend of mine told me she just laughs when watching The Texas chainsaw Massacre but I am one of the people in this world and YES!!!! it is mostly girls who gets scared by horror films whether they be scary or not. Scream scares me in parts as did the new version of Texas Chainsaw Massacre but no film has scared me the way this did and will probably be the case for a long time to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*****SPOILERS*****The Texas Chain Saw Massacre seemed like a title to fear and really get scared of. Now i had seen the remake first so i was thinking well this has to be immortal and well i was wrong. The story starts off with a group of hippies consisting of Sally Hardesty ,her brother Franklin, boyfriend Jerry, and other friends kirk and pam. They are travelling through Texas when they check up to see if there grandparents (sally and franklins grandparents) graves had been robbed . then they pick up a strange hitchhiker who cuts his hand and franklin, they throw him out of the van. They soon need to get gas but after trying at a gas station there is none left so then franklin suggests they go to the house where there old grandparents live so they do. Kirk and Pam go to where they think is a waterhole but on the way there they here a generator and believe that at another old house they may have gas for their van. they dont no this is leatherfaces house. Kirk goes into this house and see's many bones of animals and humans runs up to them and leatherface ambushes him with a mallet which leaves kirk's body in spasm. Leatherface hits him again pulls him in then slams that metal door. Pam then goes into the house looking for kirk she finds a room full of human bones and animal bones goes out of the room where leatherface comes crashing through that door chases her and takes her into his layer where he hangs pam on a meat hook and chainsaws kirk into pieces in front of pams on eyes. Later jerry decides to go look for them alone finds the house goes inside sees the meat hook drenched in blood then heres banging from a closet opens it and see's the twitching body of Pam. Leatherface then hits Jerry over the head with a mallet. Sally and Franklin go searching for the group before finally leatherface kills franklin with a chainsaw, then chases Sally to the gas station they had been to earlier this is where the cook takes her back to leatherfaces house because he's pure evil. sally watches the hitchhiker the cook and leatherface consume flesh. and she also meets the old man who sucks fingers strangely. soon she escapes and is chased by Leatherface and the hitchhiker before he is ran over by a lorry. sally then escapes from leatherface and if you ask me shes insane.Well my opinion was this was boring the deaths happened to quick acting was poor the remake beat this by far but still this film was impressive go see if you like horror not good for the weak hearted5 out of 10 joe swed</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So i don't ever write these responses. However, in the certain turn of events I felt as though it were my duty to do so. After reading a couple of reviews for the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and reading the extreme prejudice that some of you have against it, I was disgusted. Unfortunately for all of you who can only be entertained by huge special effects, massive amounts of blood, and steady camera movements...I might as well call you cronies; of course you wont appreciate the art involved in this film. What the majority of you dont understand when watching this film was, A) This was made on an extremely low budget by young filmmakers who were feeling their way around the material and B) It was going to originaly have a PG rating. (Thats raised some questions with me as well but thats neither here nor there.) It is important to keep this in mind however, because when really understanding just how limited the filmmakers were, this came out beautifully. The psychological aspects during the dinner scene are incomparable through the use of extreme close-up shots and sound. The gritty film look only helps to increase the back-door country Texas look which just adds to the over-all sick feeling which helps increase the horror. I am a film student at Syracuse University and many of us here, including staff praise this film and use it as a motivator in understanding that you can make something amazing without all of the money and effects, but rather some creativity. That is why the original 1974 piece blows away the new one- it stands on its own pedestal rather than being parasitic on something else's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS this movie would have been more appealing if it had never been made at all. the suspense is great, but the overall effect leaves A LOT to be desired. compared with the new one, the new one is much better. in this one you hardly can remember the names of the characters, but in the new one you develop a sort of bond to the characters, and that adds to the overall effect when they get chainsawed to death. in this one, half the characters are killed in 10 minutes. also, it takes about an hour for the film to get where its trying to go, and by then your already tired of it. plus leatherface looks so much scarier in the new one. you dont even know that his mask is skin in the old one, but you do catch onto the fact that the family are cannibals. dont waste your time or money on this film, waste it on the new one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deep in the heart of Texas, during a long, brutally hot summer, locals are stumbling upon the remains of descrated graves and vandalized plots. Bodies have been unearthed and arranged in profane tableaux. There are no suspects. Young Sally Hardesty arrives with her brother and three friends to check on the grave of her grandfather. When they cannot locate his grave, they journey instead to the abandoned farmhouse where he once lived. They pick up a strange hitchhiker, who stabs himself in the hand and then gleefully attacks Franklin, Sally's wheelchair bound brother. They kick the hitchhiker out and drive on until they arrive at the old homestead. As the group wanders around the neglected property, Pam and her boyfriend Kirk decide to go swimming. Discovering that the creek has dried up in the intense heat, Kirk &amp; Pam instead wander to an old house behind the Hardesty farm. Kirk disappears inside and Pam goes looking for him. Upon entering the house, she discovers a horrific scene: a room littered with bones and furniture made from skeletal remains. Disgusted and frightened, she runs from the room, only to be set upon by Leatherface, a huge, hulking man in a bloodstained butchers apron and a mask made from the skinned face of a corpse. One by one, the group disappears into the charnel house until only Sally and Franklin are left. When they set out to find out what's become of their friends, they are attacked by the chainsaw wielding Leatherface, who brutally murders Franklin while Sally watches, horrorstruck. Sally runs screaming for help only to run right into the head of the cannibal family, who stuffs Sally in a bag, beats her black and blue and drags her back to the house for dinner with the family; Leatherface, whose actual face is never seen and who only communicates with piglike sounds, and his brother, the hitchhiker who had terrorized Sally and her friends earlier. The family was once in the butcher business, and have since been replaced by machines. Reluctant to give up their trade, they have turned to grave robbing and murder. Sally is tied to a chair, tormented, tortured and finally bent over an old washtub to be bludgeoned to death by an ancient family member who can barely hold a hammer. Can Sally escape? And even if she does survive, what will be left?The very title of this film "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" still makes people flinch to this day. It is considered one of the most brutal and violent films ever made, which is rather ironic considering that there is actually very little violence to be found in this film at all. Despite the title, there is only one death-by- chainsaw, and it is filmed from the rear so that no actual chainsaw penetration is ever seen. Most of the films' raw power comes from the suggestion of violence, and the psychological terror is much more effective (and plentiful) here than blood. Poor Sally - she really suffers in this film. She's chased by the chainsaw wielding Leatherface through the night time woods, she's beaten up with a broom handle, stuffed into a bag, tied to chair, gagged, mocked and mimicked, bludgeoned by a guy who looks older than God and finally chased and slashed by a knife wielding weirdo in the films climax. This movie puts you in her position for much of the film. You can't help but squirm uncomfortably as three inbred freaks leer at you and squeal like pigs as you scream for mercy. You spend a good long time waiting for the inevitable, and the wait itself is the real horror, wondering what's going to happen to you, how much it will hurt and if you'll end up in a Mason jar as breakfast sausage. It also manages to make you a voyeur as you watch the proceedings through the dead eye of the camera, helpless to stop it or look away. You may even laugh a few times at the absurdity of the cannibal family and their antics...and then feel guilty for your giggle. This is a truly powerful film. It's sick, it's horrifying, it exhausting, but it's never needlessly gory. It doesn't need to be. This is Southern Gothic, psychological horror at its best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was that?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After my friend made me watch the movie, he apologized expressly for putting me through that hell, and I mean the literal place. He had seen the remake and therefore thought that the original would be as good if not better. We were both sadly disappointed.Okay, first of all, the filming of the movie was really rather poor. I mean half the time you couldn't see things that would have probably made the movie at least a little better. Yes darkness is good for horror films so that it creates an atmosphere but I don't feel that this was intentional. The scenes also were very grainy, which could have been because of the age but figured just in case it would be a mentioning.(Spoilers ahead)Than you get to the movie itself. It had NO plot what-so-ever. There is no real explanation why the 5 teenagers/20 years old are going on a trip through nowhere Texas, I mean yes there is their grandfather or whatever but it really goes into no real detail. The whole movie just drags through, I felt like I was watching Titanic again wonder when the ship was going to sink except here I was wondering when they would just finally go off and kill the characters off. You sit through around 20 minutes of pointlessness where the characters just bitch and make fun of each other; you do not develop any feelings at all for the characters. This just makes the movie that less horrifying and the death scenes even more boring than they already were. I was actually cheering on leather face because he characters are so annoying and blah. Which makes me say, what is so freaky about leather face? You never really see his face..and sorry to say the faces over his weren't THAT scary.The characters actions throughout the movie can't be held against this film since almost all horror movie characters make really stupid decisions, like picking up hitchhikers who look like they haven't seen a shower in years and going off to investigate a strange house in the middle of nowhere and then just barging right in.All I can say is that there were three `good' scenes in the movie. The first being when Franklin gets killed. I mean, he has to be the most annoying, childish, idiotic character that I've ever seen. My friend and I cheered when Franklin got torn up with the chainsaw. The next scene was when Sally (played by Marilyn Burns, the best actor in the whole film) runs into the tree branch. It's like, she's looking forward and suddenly when she looks back she runs straight into a branch, which just comes out of nowhere. Finally, when Sally runs into the gas service man (I never caught his name, if he had one), who is actually part of the family, he ends of beating her up with a broom, of all things, and she drops her knife while he's beating her. It doesn't even look like he's hitting her that hard and it's with the bristles. I know if I was being attacked I would let someone hit me with a broom and drop the knife I was. This was just a funny/stupid scene.For all the hype that there is on this movie, i.e. that it's a cult classic and that it's really scary, it was kind of a disappointment. I mean yes I understand that in 1974 people had never seen something like this before but really there are other older horror films that are much more frightening and actually have a plot. This IS based on a true story here. They could of at least made an attempt at putting a little of a story behind it other than a psychotic, cannibalistic family and a group of kids who run into them. It's like a PWP (porn without plot) except it's a FWP (Film w/o plot).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserves its Status as Horror Cult Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS]Following a bizarre cemetery desecration in Murtaugh County, Texas by someone who decided to make art out of the corpses, Sally Hardester (Marilyn Burns), her brother Franklin (Paul A. Partain), her boyfriend Jerry (Allen Danziger) and their friends Kirk (William Vail) and Pam (Teri McMinn) visit the graveyard to make certain their grandfather's grave has not been disturbed. Feeling reassured that it hasn't, they leave in their van. Along the way, they decide to visit the old house nearby that the two of them grew up in when they spot an hitch-hiker (Edwin Neal) near the local slaughterhouse. This hitch-hiker proves to be quite the disturbing character full of tales about the local slaughterhouse, most of which are disturbing and disgusting to normal folks but not this fellow. No he gives to meaning to the word "weirdo". Anyways eventually he becomes more and more agitated and finally attacks one of the kids with a knife. Following this, he is soon booted out of the van after which he smears his blood on the side of the van...to leave his mark perhaps? Eventually they make it to the old Hardester place despite the fact that the local gas station had no gas to put into the van. After exploring the old house and finding it not as exciting as hoped, Kirk and Pam decide to investigate the local water hole Franklin had told them about only to find it now dry and dusty when they hear a generator. Going to explore, Kirk eventually discovers an house with the door left open. After going in to explore, Kirk disappears while Pam wonders what's happened to him eventually venturing into the house herself discovering something worst than any nightmare she could ever imagine...and Leatherface. This movie is an onslaught on the senses. It's without any doubt one of the first Horror films to grab the viewer right by the throat and never let go. It manages to make its characters human..flawed beings but human. Even the most disturbing of characters here has human failings and weaknesses. This is especially important to establish in a film that wants its audience to feel for what are in this case its victims...for the film to have full impact we have to empathize with their situation and we certainly do here. The lack of gore leaves much to the imagination and what the imagination dreams up is usually far worse than what generally came to be shown on screen. The sound effects add to this feeling enormously as does the frantic pace of the film. Watching this movie affects the viewer because its events don't seem so impossible as we know that deep down human beings can be the most terrifying of all the Earth's creatures. This one stays with you after viewing and deserves its rightful standing as a Horror Cult Classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tobe Hooper's 'Massacre' is both disturbing and horrifying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After their grandfather's grave has been desecrated, two siblings (Marilyn Burns, Paul A. Partain) and their friends travel to a cemetery in Texas to investigate, but their van runs out of gas in the middle of nowhere. While looking for gas, they stumble upon a house that's inhabited by a cannibalistic family, including a chainsaw-wielding maniac named Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen). One by one, the teens are tortured and butchered.Loosely based on the true crimes of murderer Ed Gein, writer/director Tobe Hooper's ("Poltergeist") low-budget tale is both disturbing and horrifying. It's also very hard to watch. As the film progresses, the terror grows and grows until the final reel. There's hardly any blood and certainly no gore, just plain terror. Most of the performances are second rate, but who cares? Just see it for the terror and suspense. A must-see for horror fans. Followed by three weak sequels and remade in 2003. My evaluation: *** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most shocking films I've ever seen....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing Texas Chainsaw Massacre for the first time today, I have to say that it ranks up there with The Exorcist as one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen. This movie represents what a horror movie is all about....this is how it's supposed to be done. Its straight to the point, it thrusts you right into the thick of the events, and they happen with no warning. I don't think anything truly 'scares' me nowadays, its more shocking than anything else...and I guess that is how people judge what a 'scary' movie is. The low-budget look is very much welcomed in this film, it helps the film get its point across and its a great look. I was curious as to whether we would get a look into what exactly went on in that house, and boy did we ever! I came away from TCM truly stunned at what I just saw. And to think that this film was made almost 30 years ago, and I was affected by it as if I saw it the year it was released, says a lot about the quality of this film....especially one of its genre. I was actually compelled to see this when I went to see Freddy vs. Jason last night and saw the preview for the remake of TCM, which I have NO INTEREST in seeing and I feel is/will be a disgrace to this original classic. Don't get fooled by the title of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, this is a classic horror film in every sense of the word, and ranks up with The Exorcist and The Shining as the best horror films I've ever seen. Truly disturbing, shocking, gritty filmmaking at its best. **** out of **** stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Possible spoilers.)Wallowing in bitterness after wasting my money on Robozo Zombie's garbage fest, "House of 1,ooo Corpses," I decided to give "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" another look. It's not a masterpiece, but it is an above-average horror film that makes a virtue of its low budget, its grainy film stock, and authentic locations. A group of kids (including a man-child in a wheelchair) out for an afternoon drive run out of gas and eventually fall victim to a family of cannibalistic hillbillies, led by Leatherface, a masked deviant who wields the titular weapon. The slim plot is both a plus and a detracting factor--on one hand, this minimalism gives the film a documentary, "you-are-there" feel; but it also renders the characters as not much more than one-dimensional cannibal fodder (even the lone heroine spends much of the last act screaming insanely). The macabre humor is quite strong ("Look what your brother did to the door!" always merits a laugh), as are the hillbillies: Edwin Neal as a psychotic hitchhiker, Jim Siedow as a seemingly normal gas station owner, and the aforementioned Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen). The house where these deviants reside is an impressive set consisting of furniture crafted out of limbs and bone, and mummified relatives residing upstairs. "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is a memorable horror film, certainly a labor of love and an impressive low-budget effort, but it's far from a masterpiece.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is a movie for the complete and total psycho in all of us. I have been waiting to see THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE for many years now. And now that I have seen it, my eyes have been opened. The film is very graphic and the acting is very realistic. Of course, it is just another "slasher" film, but this one is very good.The film has an extremely high shock factor and is ultimately disturbing. There is a very gruesome and meticulous nature here and it is a film that really scares the hell out of some people. Not really based on the Ed Gein from 1950s Wisconsin, this film follows a group of teenagers as they encounter a grotesque "family" of cannibalistic inbreds. The film is truly creepy and this film had my eyes open wide. I usually do not find horror movies scary in the least, but THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE was deeply frightening. I recommend FRIDAY THE 13TH or THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.For the real maniac in all of us. Can't wait to see the remake (which will be scored by Marilyn Manson! Yay!). THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE gets 4/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>-May Contain some Spoilers- This movie is cool because of the claustrofobic atmosphere it gives you,since the beginning the scenes involving the hitchhiker inside the van are creepy,I´ve seen a lot of specials and a lot of documentaries talking about this film and almost in all of them you get by conclution that the less they showed of gore and leatherface the scarier it got,just like on the original `JAWS' where the really don´t show the shark or the `Blair Witch',That´s what make it very cruel and sadistic,the gore you don´t get to see because the images we get to imagine go beyond what they show us. Leatherface is a Psichotic/transvesty who lives with his family: 2 brothers and his old father (by the way they´re all Crazy killers) in an isolated house out on Texas,some kids go to a house that belonges to a parent of one of them and get lost in the way finding these blood thirsty characters.This is a true horror classic and it´s sad to see director Tobe Hooper now a days doing stupid giant alligator movies for a few bucks,as they say,when you´re on the top there´s no other way but down...low down.I´ll still give it a good 10 out of 10 on Psichotic Chainsaw Murderers movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS** **SPOILERS** Shame. I'd heard a lot about this film, and when I saw it I was almost inevitably disapointed. Reasons why (SPOILERS)? 1) It's just not scary. Sorry but it isn't. Marilyn Burns (Sally) does little apart from talk to her borther and scream a lot, and thats not how I like my heroines. 2) The table scene when Grampa comes out. This is not scary just sick and disturbing with the poor girl just screaming whilst everyone else is mocking her. And quite honestly, the human corpse is just horrible. 3) There is almost no explanation of what is going on. The hitch-hiker and the garage worker were underused. Plus are they family? Workers at the abatoir? Random people? 4) There is little script. Just "I'll look in the house oops I've been murdered" Sally screaming and a chainsaw whiring. 5) Leatherface survives. 6) Leatherface gets played by Dennis Hopper in the sequal. The film has good points however. It is shocking. It does have good effects. Although I bitched about this earlier, it does have a good ending with leatherface whiring his chainsaw furiously.So it is worth watching. Just don't expect a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Horrifying, Unrelenting Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unrelenting would best sum up the atmosphere of this film. I found every minute of this movie to be painfully terrifying to get through. As a huge fan of the movie, I can appreciate watching some of the more tame scenes of the movie and seeing the impending dangers closing in like charging bull. I one time heard someone say their favorite part of a horror film is before the horror starts, and watching as the characters are drawn into the terror of the film later on. Though few see the tame scenes as filler, and just a wait for the carnage to begin, this movie executes those scenes amazingly well. The first time I saw this movie, I afraid in the first scene when the van stopped by the side of the road, so horrified of what could happen, that what did happen--though almost considered kind of funny by many--seemed terrifying.One of the most shocking scenes is the first murder, because to someone watching, it is so quick and horrifying that you have to sit back and try to register what just happened to this character, and what just happened to you. Then the second murder--the infamous hook scene--gives a somewhat clearer picture of the horrors to endure, only heightened by the preceding scenes in the living room.The movie truly explodes at the fourth murder/beginning of the long, relentless chase scene through the underbrush and backwoods. The scene when Sally Hardesty (played to honest perfection by should-have-been-a-big-star scream queen Marilyn Burns) gets to the house and runs up into the attic...well, I'll leave that scene to you. The dinner scene is disturbing to no end, with Sally screaming and begging for her life. You truly wonder if or how she will survive this nightmare, let alone escape. It's a struggle to sit through the sledgehammer scene without wincing at each attempt. Then the ending. The ending that may just be the most breathtaking ending to a horror movie. I guess you could consider it "positive." But it's so wild and so insane that you don't even get a chance to feel relief. I always wondered what happened to the trucker who stopped to help. It was the only true fault in the movie, that his character was abandoned, but I suppose in a way you can add that to the list of questions as to what would be the next course of events in the movie after the ending. (To list the other questions would be a terrible spoiler.) There is so much to say on this. The way the many old cars around the barn Kirk and Pam see implies the true massacre of the film, and not just the small handful of deaths in this movie. The way humans are portrayed as animals, and the family of cannibals are portrayed as us, the humans, with intentions only to kill and eat, it would seem. It's like a George Romero, how so much of this film has a message about something else. Also to mention again is the performace by Marilyn Burns. I was literally blown away by her performance as the horrified "final girl" who must endure a night of true hell. I only wish we got to see more of her, she is definitely an underrated scream queen.This is a true piece of cinema masterpiece. And as I said, it's unrelenting. Absolutely unrelenting.</fullReview>

I'm not big on grim and gritty movies, and those two words fit "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" to a tee. This movie is so dark that it could depress even Trent Reznor. But it does introduce one of the greatest characters to ever hit the silver screen, Leatherface, so this flick will always have a special place in my heart. Every scene with Leatherface is a delight: From his shocking first appearance complete with hammer and pig noises to his final dance with the swinging chainsaw, America knew it had a new cinematic sweetheart.Leatherface gets able support by his family members Cook and Hitchhiker, who are also great characters, but the movie has long patches that I didn't enjoy. The endless scenes of the main female victim screaming eventually take on the quality of a fever dream, until she bursts into the dream-like finale. This movie is a very, very good one, a classic, but it's just not going to be everyone's cup of tea. I think the gorier, funnier sequel is a much more enjoyable movie, but parts three and four stink and completely ruin the great Leatherface. And that about wraps up my comments on the whole "Texas Chainsaw" deal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have heard this is one of the best horror movies ever. I couldn't disagree more. Maybe if I had seen this film in 1974 I would have liked it, but as of now it just seems cheap. People say it is psychological but after watching it twice I don't see how they could think that. This movie is about being brutal, and it does a very poor job, even for low budget.If you want to see a good low budget horror film, I recommend Evil Dead.TCM is much like The Blair Witch Project, a lot of hype and little substance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fluffy Pink Bunnies Go Hop Hop Hop...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, no, this is not a film about some pink, fluffy bunnies, but it is a repellent, crude, effective, sadistic shocker from Tobe Hooper about a friendly family from Texas who just likes to bar-b-que. Not nearly as gory as many modern slasher flicks, which somehow makes it seem even moore unpleasant, TCM is a touchstone modern horror/slasher film. Effective use of setting, twisted moosic, and casting by some of the ugliest cretins this side of West Texas, TCM is a mixture of 2/3s solid horror and 1/3 thorough unpleasantness. One especially disturbing scene is the Grandpa finger-suck, a scene which makes this cow want to take about 37 showers. Pacing and tension are problematic - in fact, the very first time the MooCow tried to watch this film, in a dusty drive-in many mooons ago, he fell asleep in his massively buttered popcorn. Other problems abound. When the twisted hicks torture and torment their last victim, Tobe Hooper crosses the line separating true horror from sickening, sadistic voyeurism (much like the repellent, worthless Bloodsucking Freaks). Victim characters suffer from the "I Can't Believe They're So Stupid" Syndrome, and the overall plot is thinner than Calista Flockheart on Herbalife. Still, TCM gains points from sheer vile, degenerate depravity alone. Not what the MooCow would call a "date" flick. MooCow says true horror fans should give it a look; others might want to find My Little Pony Visits Lollypop Land. :=8/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If i must be honest i didn't think this movie was scary.Oh well maybe in the end-chase ( best chase ever made ) and the scenes after. It more is very disgusting. In most horror movies ( e.g ''Scream'' or ''Halloween'' ) you just watch them and jump a few times and have a great time. But in this movie.... You just feel the terror creeping up in your body. it's just disgusting. Coz nobody has talked about it ( coz nobody has dared to see it ) so you don't know what to expect. But really I can't figure out what the fuss was all about. It actually isn't as horrible as it's told. But i guess it was worse in the 70-tees.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bizarre, Brutal &amp; Insanely Unsettling Meditation On Madness... That Has Unfortunately Aged Terribly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They said Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is one of the most disturbing films ever made. They said it's a timeless classic which will forever be etched in your memory once you've seen it. They said the very experience of sitting through this slasher flick is deeply traumatic &amp; unsettling. And they said that it's the most influential horror film there ever has been in the annals of cinema.For anyone who saw this film at a young age or back when it was released or who are generally capable of looking past the decaying visual encapsulation unlike me, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is destined to be a scarring experience. For me however, this was an unintentionally hilarious ride from start to finish that simply failed to live up to its unprecedented reputation but by no degree does it mean that I don't respect its legacy or influence.Advertising itself to be based on a true story despite featuring a fictional set of plot &amp; characters with the only real-life inspiration coming from the works of notorious serial killer Ed Gein, the story of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is the very blueprint of all slasher films ever made and concerns a group of five friends who en route to visit an old homestead in Texas fall victim to a chainsaw wielding killer &amp; his crazy family of grave-robbing cannibals.Co-written &amp; directed by Tobe Hooper, the film remains his most famous work to date which later went on to establish its own franchise while spawning or inspiring many others. And despite being called one of the most violent &amp; goriest movies ever made, it's surprising that there isn't much of either in the film for the real horror or shock actually comes from what is implied rather than what is presented.An insane ride that unexpectedly turns funny in the middle despite an excellent build-up, the film is full of moments that just had me in splits. Leatherface is one of cinema's most iconic villains yet all he does here is run around carrying an active chainsaw that never runs out of gas. His cannibal family is equal bunch of retards &amp; their expressions are hilarious as hell. And Marilyn Burns... well, she runs a lot &amp; she sure screams an infinite times more throughout the picture.And of course how can I forget the final moments before the end credits that was probably trying to show Leatherface in frustration but ended up being the funniest scene in the entire picture thanks to the crazy gestures the poor guy makes. In all honesty, this was tough to take seriously, the whole picture I mean. It's a proved classic &amp; I wish I could've enjoyed it as much as its most hardcore fans but maybe it wasn't meant to be.On an overall scale, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is one horror classic that comes as a must for every horror fanatic out there. It doesn't matter if you're going to like it or hate it, you have to check it out nonetheless. There rarely isn't a moment in the film that hasn't been imitated over the years &amp; its influence can be felt in most horror flicks of today but I still wish its visual presentation hadn't aged as badly as it has because I really wanted to love this film.An unflinching meditation on madness, a revolutionary slasher flick with an unrivaled cult following &amp; one of its genre's proudest examples, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is the reason why so many horror classics exist today in the first place for it took cinema to an insanely disturbing depths unlike ever before yet I can't help but wonder if it's just my opinion or does it truly fail to stand against the test of time. Either way, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre comes recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Preposterous early teen slasher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was bitterly disappointed by this film It takes a lot to shock me but I must admit I was afraid of seeing that one. But this film did not make me scream in terror, it just made me laugh out loud. The chainsaw noise was intriguing for one minute then became absolutely ridiculous. The "family reunion" made me think about the Addams Family. The killer is lame, the victims are dull. There is absolutely no buildup in the terror, no atmosphere, no development, you never get hooked. Being bang on the shocking scenes may have been an editorial choice, but for me it just doesn't work at all. The only thing this film is noteworthy about is that it predated the classic, lame teen slasher movies, with the group of teenagers and the busty girl in a tank top going for a ride in the country and running into much predictable trouble, filmed with shaky cameras.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece of Suspense &amp; Disturbance that will be here Shock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the finest Horror films there is. For it's time it was a blood bath, but these days, it's known as a mild-violent like classic. Bloody or not, I'm still very happy Hooper';s work, one way or another.The story starts as Sally and her brother and 3 friends go along on a drive through ol' county Texas to see their loved ones deaths. Too bad for them that they run into a Chainsaw Wielding Maniac called Leatherface who loves to wear the skin of his victims. The thing i really loved about the film was in the first half of the film before Frank gets killed, we are in total shock about what's happening here and there and about why the victims are suddenly not coming back. Then Hooper anti's up the Suspense after Frank has died and we are in total dread and disturbance towards the end. To me, combining those two types of atmospheres really works. Too bad it can't be done in many horror films these days, or remakes for that matter...When I watched the film, I mean yes, I felt in total shock/dread. This is a master piece that Tobe Hooper has created and it will always leave you in total suspense no matter what. If you like suspenseful, shocking, horrific films,then this film is for you.Tobe Hooper also did a good job at this film because he created something new. He wanted Fear to be born and he gave that to us in this film. Tobe Hooper did an excellent job and I also think Gunnar Hansen was excellent as Leatherface. he really put out an disturbing killer. He will always be the true Leatherface.Also the scary close up shots of corpses, cinematography work and sound effects (not music) are excellent and well done. I give that full 5/5I don't mind the remake though Tobe Hooper's classic cult TCM will always remain good as it is.I'd give it a 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been wanting to watch this film for a few years now, but I thought I would be "scared" after watching it. After seeing the rating on IMDb, I though it would be a good movie to watch. Even though this movie is a classic, it is just bad. There is no other way of putting it. The dialogue was bad, most of it was just Sally screaming her head off for long periods of time. The acting wasn't to great either. The deaths were short and it wasn't long enough for them to put up much of a fight. The end was pretty bad as well. It was short, left a lot of loose ends and it never went on to see what happened to Sally or the truck driver. I am giving this movie a 4 out of 10. And I think that is fairly generous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even giving it the benefit of the doubt, I can't find too many redeeming qualities in Texas Chainsaw Massacre.The plot has become the standard story for the next four decades of horror flicks, the characters are as generic as they can be, the violence isn't even scary nor disturbing...Horror movies have different ways to scare the audience: the most common are gore (i.e. physical violence/torture) or psychological distress.TCM fails at both.The violence is pretty much par for the course, with nothing overly graphic or nauseating.The psychological aspect is totally absent: it's impossible feeling empathy for the victims, and the murderers are so implausible and cartoonish you almost expect Uncle Fester to show up at dinner table.Not scary, not unsettling, just grotesque and dull.I'm aware I can't judge the movie with today's standards, but despite its status of Cult Movie, groundbreaking work etc etc, I just can't bring myself to care much about it.As scary as this may sound (and it IS scary to say), the glossy and Hollywood-style remake was better. At least it didn't look like an high-school project filmed with grandpa's old 8mm</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where is the brilliance?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies do not always have to be nice or politically correct, but if one wants to take that approach, then at least have the decency to do it well. The right way gives you films like Psycho, and the wrong way gives you a film like Texas Chain Saw Massacre. There are two ways in which an sadistic perverted film like this may be considered acceptable. If it was trying to tell a true story like the recently made Australian film Wolf Creek, that would be acceptable. If it was trying to deliver a logical message, about say humanity, that would be acceptable. Unfortuanety, neither is the case with Tobe Hooper's debut, making me wonder why people find this so brilliant. Just because it is scary and was produced from mere pocket change in my opinion does not amount to brilliance. The only reason I made it through this was because, as dumb as Tobe Hooper is at least he keeps his story moving. After the introduction, there is never really a dull moment, although it occasionally feels repetitious, Texas Chainsaw massacre has energy. enough to make it watchable but I can recommend better films like this.The story is simple, five kids take a road trip to an old house which used to belong to the parents of one of them. Living nearby is a family of slaughter house workers. In a matter of hours all but one of the kids 'Sally' are dead, and she too is in great danger. In the middle of nowhere, with absolutely nothing, has has to save herself.What little money the film has obviously went to set decoration. Everything else is poor. One thing that annoyed me was too many badly lit wide shots during scenes of conversation showing a total lack of experience on the director's part. People may call this brilliant or revolutionary, but those kinds of comments are really not very useful. It doesn't in anyway hint as to whether you will or will not enjoy the film. If you hear any of your friends say such things about Texas Chain Saw Massacre, ask them about their reasons for praising it, before going out to see it yourself. It may not be as special as you think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as horrific as by reputation, and has some scenes that will stick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was a teenager, I hired this movie when I was looking for extreme horror, and the title and reputation of this movie seemed to guarantee that (my attitudes have changed in the meantime, as illustrated in my review of "Hostel" here).Since it's been so long since I've seen this movie, I'll just recall some impressions of this movie: * Firstly, I was disappointed by the amount of shock value of this movie-nowadays, I suppose that this might be welcome! In other words, if you are after extreme gore, this is not the movie for you.* The story was apparently based on an actual case in America-as was Alfred Hitchcock's movie "Psycho". There could not be two more disparate movies in style and substance and they don't really seem to have that much subject overlap. You do have to wonder how much either of those movies owes to an 'actual' case.* There are some moments of shock in this film...e.g. when "Leatherface" makes his first appearance.* Not sure whether this was in the movie or not, but I seem to remember having a weird dream which I attributed to a scene from this movie-my dream had a weird looking chicken in a undersized bird-cage. As I've said, some scenes stick out in this movie.* And lastly, the main reason I am posting this review is to mention something which REALLY surprised me...the TV series The Simpsons ripped off a scene from this movie! I can't say that they parodied it or satirised it, as they basically just replay an entire scene from this movie. It's the scene where "the family" are eating at the table together and...(I won't spoil it for you). Now, what's strange about all this as that I was STAGGERED that the writers of the Simpsons drew on one of the most notorious horror movies of all time to 'satirise'. When I saw this movie for the first and last time all those years ago, I did find that scene funny...incongruously funny. It's VERY black humour I can understand why The Simpson's writers would want to bring that scene to a new audience.I don't have any philosophical objections to seeing this movie again sometime. Be interesting to see if I rate it higher after viewing it as an adult.From memory, disappointing, but could re-evaluate on rewatching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" gets better every year. No matter how many times they remake this Tobe Hooper classic, they will never be able to top the relentless violence, mad rush of insanity and sheer greatness of the final hour of this film.Hard to imagine this film came out in the early 70's...it's still shocking and it's still hard to watch. It's like Hooper and crew set out to make the most horrific thing they could think of. It's upsetting and it's unnatural and no matter how many times I watch it, that decrepit farmhouse and that ugly grandfather will still haunt me for days after watching it.It's pretty much the best thing in horror, right up there with Kubrick's "The Shining" and Friedken's "The Exorcist." And like those two directors, Hooper never exceeded this achievement in his later films.Absolutely essential viewing for anyone who loves movies.10 out of 10, kids.</fullReview>

And it was just as scary as three years before.Every once in a while I rewatch it, and I am still as scared and as sickened by the madness in it as the first time.The acting, the music, plot and the way it was shot are all great. It doesn't hit a false note once.As for the remake... well, each and every time I think about renting it or its prequel, I blink and think 'Hell no! You can't remake perfection and be just as good!' I will get around to watch them, though... eventually.As for this one, it rules! Italian Title: 'Non Aprite Quella Porta' ('Don't Open That Door').Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974): 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>70's horror at it's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Major classic horror from the 1970's where five teens take a road trip across Texas stop by an old house and gets stalked and killed by Leatherface.Director Tobe Hooper knows how to scare his audience and starts out slowly to shock us with a bang, then another, and then just keeps the shocks coming while keeping up a sweaty pace. Even if you know what's coming, the creepy feeling of the terror closing in is still freakishly intense.I love the contrast between the colourful 70's fashion (bell bottoms, flashy shirts, crazy sideburns) and the deadly surrounding and also not knowing what's about to happen to them.What this movie has which the other sequels lack is a sense of realism like we get to know the characters before they meet they're fates. When the horror kicks in, it's brutal and exhausting. We have the seemingly never-ending chasing-scene where poor heroine Marilyn Burns is followed by the furious Leatherface through the woods, in the house and through the woods again. Without Hooper's excellent direction this scene would die after a minute or so, but it has Leatherface so close onto Burns that you're glued to the seat and praying the she'll get away.The acting is top notch, Marylin Burns (Sally) truly gave a believable performance as the lead heroine, Paul A Partian (Franklin) plays the annoying wheelchair bound brother excellently, Edwin Neal (Hitchiker) gave me shivers every time I saw him especially the van scene he's maybe a bit too believable as a psycho. Jim Siedow (Old Man) gives a deranged, unpredictable performance and last but not least Gunner Hansen as Leatherface himself gives a rather startling performance as the chainsaw wielding psychopath.Despite there not being much gore, this movie packs a punch with really tense scenes like when Leatherface drags a doomed girl through the house and hangs her on the meat hook, I can only imagine the pain and torture she's suffered and the most brutal murder of all Franklin murdered with the chainsaw defenceless in his wheelchair, and the scary invited to dinner scene with Marylin Burns as the psycho family's guest.All in all this isn't just another run of the mill Slasher it's a masterpiece in film making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can you say "overrated?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is, quite possibly, the most overrated film of all time. I've never been so psyched to see a movie, and the fact that I wasn't allowed to watch until my 13th birthday only made me all the more excited. I have to say that, other than the Pulse remake, the When a Stranger Calls remake, The Fog remake, the original Black Christmas, and Hard Candy, this movie is the biggest horror disappointment of my lifetime.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is directed by the "legendary" Tobe Hooper, but to be completely honest, I've seen few of his films. The only quality movie I've seen this guy direct is the remake of The Toolbox Murders. He does, however, fill this movie with a few interesting camera angles. Sally (Marilyn Burns), her wheelchair-bound brother, Franklin (Paul A. Partain), and their three friends are on their way to visit their grandfather's grave in Texas. Along the way, they pick up a psychotic hitchhiker (Edwin Neal) on the side of the road who turns out to be more than they were expecting. The five friends soon wind up at a creepy old, seemingly-abandoned house where each of them exhibits a grizzly encounter with a shadowy menace known only as Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen). Sally flees for her life in a desperate attempt to help her friends as the others are killed off one by one at the hands of Leatherface and his sadistically twisted cannibalistic dysfunctional family.All I knew about this film before watching it was that it was supposedly the 'definitive' horror movie, and it was said to be one of the best of all time. Not only is the remake far better than the overrated original, but the underrated prequel, Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning tops even the remake. For one, I really didn't like the overall "feel" of the movie. If this garbage was supposed to be scary, then something is seriously wrong here. I didn't even get chills, and everything scares me! The only scene that I truly found unnerving at best was when Leatherface hit a man on the top of the head with a sledgehammer. I found myself laughing more than screaming in fear. The scariest movie ever? I think not! The acting was trash, although I did like the lead female and Leatherface. The hitchhiker was retarded and dull, and Sally's wheelchair-bound brother was one of the most annoying characters ever to hit the big screen. The movie is outdated and very ineffective compared to some of today's horror movies. I really don't see what everyone finds so spectacular about this film. The ending is a pathetic cop-out, although Leatherface's chainsaw dance is probably the most memorable thing about a mostly forgettable piece of cinema. The infamous dinner table sequence is also one of the better scenes, although it wasn't really anything special; the prequel did the scene much better. I will admit that some of the camera shots show some skill and are quite intriguing, but as a whole, there is nothing too impressive here. Sure, the movie looks like a documentary, but is that what we're really looking for in a horror movie? Not everything about the picture is all bad. The tone and atmosphere were perfectly established in a very subtle manner, and the chase scene through the woods is utterly sensational. Skip this original flick in a well-known series; you're not missing much, trust me. Instead, check out the remake, or some of the quality sequels, or even the sensational prequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its a classic, yes. But lets face it. The movie drags on way too long. Yes it was a lot different than many other films at the time and does seem like it were a real story. This movie however is crap. Sure there are some freaky elements to it. A mask made of skin, a room full of bones, an old guy being helped by his grandson to hit a woman in the head with a hammer and missing for about five minutes...absolutely stupid. Getting chased through woods, into a house, back into the woods, into another garage which again dragged on for even longer...boring! This film does not live up to its hype. See the remake its a lot better. I didn't see the original until after the remake. After I watched the old one I watched the new one again. Its so much better. The reviews same different. I guess because the story was changed. Big deal. The original was crap. Actually I gave been seeing previews for the prequel, "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Biginning," and there are a lot of things from the original in it. Hopefully they do it right on this one which I'm sure they will after how good the remake of the original was. I'm no movie critic but I know crap when I see it. I'm sorry to all you horror movie and Texas Chainsaw fans but I found this movie to be crap. Watch it if you just want to say that you did. It is for some reason one of the more popular horror films of all time. Although I can't see why. I'll let you watch it and decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE (1974) ***1/2 One of the scariest and most ripped-off modern horror films of all time that became an instant cult- classic thanks to filmmaker Tobe Hooper's shrewd low-budget instincts to film the ensuing carnage as a defacto documentary into hell: a group of young friends wind up in a backwater charnel house of horrors as they are stalked by the chainsaw wielding mad-man/butcher Leatherface (a pop culture idol of millions of fanboys and genre lovers to date) and his 'family' of miscreant psychopaths. Disturbing, raw and visceral but surprisingly not gory (the only true setback for me!) and a nice touch of dreadful suspense. Screamer Marilyn Burns as the resiliently reluctant heroine is one of the unsung 'scream queens' of American cinema. And yes that is John Larroquette as the sonorous narrator!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, I remember being hugely impressed with this movie when I last saw it when I was in high school. I watched it again recently to get a look at the older movies before watching what I have heard is a "stupid, stupid remake," and was amazed that I ever enjoyed this movie. I respect it in that it is incredibly effective, especially as horror movies go, but the last time I had seen it was at a time when I was also impressed but absolute garbage like the Faces of Death movies ? movies that there is no reason for anyone to watch. Ever. The movies is based on a true story, as they say (how loosely based is still a matter of debate), which adds an element of intrigue to the story, but it is simply an unappealing and sick movie that it's difficult to enjoy, even for horror fans. I am a huge horror fan, but when I see a blonde girl screaming in terror literally nonstop, it gets a little hard to take. It's cool to see a teenager scream and then get slashed by a masked killer, but to watch a teenager screaming endlessly as this sick and twisted family forces her to participate in their disgusting family rituals is not amusing in the least. What is this, an exploration of the depths of human depravity?The movie gets high marks because it certainly is well made and effective, I just can't help being put off by it. It's not fun to watch, even as a gory horror film, which I think counts against it in the end. There is a way to make a movie like this without being too over the top and gratuitous but still remaining faithful to whatever it was that really took place that summer in Texas. Glamorizing the violence and shoving the audience's faces into the sick things that this family was into is not the way. Texas Chainsaw comes off as a hugely effective movie that's really weakly made. They allowed to sheer disgustingness of this family tell the story, rather than use the endless opportunities afforded by the medium to create a fascinating story, and a whole series of stupid sequels did not help much.Ah well?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A definitive horror film - "the Texas Chainsaw Massacre."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the grim opening narration by a gravely voiced John Larroquette, to the grisly shot of a decaying corpse that has been so delicately placed atop of a tombstone, to the final shot of Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) angrily wielding his weapon of choice in the air with the rising sun behind him, Tobe Hooper's 1974 classic "the Texas Chainsaw Massacre" fixes you in its gravitational pull and sucks you into its dark, twisted universe. "Massacre," inspired in part by the real life of serial killer Ed Gein, tells the horrifying story of five teenagers who are on a drive through the Texas country. They pick up a hitchhiker, which naturally turns out to be a bad idea. He cuts one of them (doesn't kill him), and then gets out. They stop by a house and encounter the cannibalistic family that lives there.From what I just described, you'd expect this film to be another slice and dice horror movie because it has such a narrow plot. That is not so with this film. What you end up getting from this film is a grueling experience in sheer terror. The cinematography is eerie (as to match the tone of the film and heighten the experience) and adds new dimensions to a one-sided and (typically) empty genre.One of the many reasons "Massacre" works is because of the extreme, macabre nature of the film. The events unfolding in front of us (the dinner scene, Marilyn Burns's chase through the woods with Leatherface right behind her) occur in such a surreal and frightening fashion that we have to step back and ask ourselves, "Is this stuff really happening?" I know I asked myself that question several times during my first viewing of this film. Tobe Hooper made one of the best and most influential horror films in 1974 and certainly one of the most memorable movie maniacs of all time - Leatherface. Leatherface is played to grisly perfection by Gunnar Hansen (his face is never actually seen). He is just so convincingly played as both an idiot and a cold-blooded killer; it's a shame that he was skipped over by the Academy."The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is one of the best horror films I have and probably ever will see. It is no wonder that this film is regarded as a classic.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie will make you turn vegetarian.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can see why a whole generation of people in the 70's went vegetarian. This movie is a powerful, disturbing illustration of the double standard in society of what it is not okay to do to humans, but okay to do to animals (chop them up, skin them, use their corpses for raw materials and eventually eat them). There are hints all the way through this movie to this subtext: the first half hour of dialogue is laced with references to abbatoirs, animal cruelty - and the killings themselves are basically doing to humans what society does to animals (in an exaggerated, horror movie way, obviously). The fact that Leather face wears a mask of human skin, and this is called 'Leather' refers to the fact that we skin cows then wear their skin and call it leather. And the fact that Leatherface wears a butcher's apron the entire time, and the place he chops up bodies is sealed off by a big steel door which reminds one of a kitchen and an abbatoir.This might be the sickest, most disturbing thing i've ever seen - and i'm fairly open minded. Tobe Hooper's seminal horror classic is brilliant, to say the least, but i wouldn't recommend you see it - i certainly wish i hadn't. Made on a very low budget, it is brilliantly shot and atmospheric, but incredibly upsetting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>-**** out of **** Now we have all heard this being called one of the goriest films of all time... so gory its disturbing. That is a load of *chainsaw sound*. Yes, there are deaths. Yes, cannibalism is hinted. But they don't realy show but one death. The first death with the sledgehammer... which looks more like he was tapped on the head and was forced to do the worm. Then there is the ONLY chainsaw death... and its shown from behind... in the woods... in the dark. How is one death by chainsaw considered a chainsaw massacre? And Headcheese... if the movie showed more of the deaths this would of been an appropriate name. But the name I have to give it is French Cheese, the cheese with the ability to stink you to tears. And they even remade it... I hope the remake will show the deaths from a good view. If you want gore, go see an Evil Dead film or Hellraiser 1-3. I do admit though, the 2nd one is good and you get to see the deaths alot better. I haven't seen the third but I have also seen the one with R.Z.... the one actress who should of been killed by chainsaw BEFORE the movie was made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it's just me, but I failed to see just what makes this movie so special. Last night was the first time I ever watched this movie. I'd heard all kinds of stuff from people on how creepy and scary this movie was supposed to be.... I was very... very... very disappointed.Maybe I had my hopes up too high, but this movie wasn't a bit scary. I didn't even jump at a single occasion (and trust me, I tend to jump a lot, much to my friends amusement ;)The thought of a guy wearing a fleshmask chasing teens with a chainsaw sounds pretty neat for a horror flick, but the way it's performed in this movie it's more laughable but scary. So you have Leatherface, this rather large fellow, now, he doesn't really look all that scary, despite his skin-mask, and he keeps making all these corny noises, which makes him appear less dangerous and more comical. And the fact that he cant catch a girl who can barely run after jumping through a 2nd story window, makes him even less scary... so what we end up with is a big guy in a mask running around with a chainsaw while squealing like a pig. Not very scary (the evening news gives me more of a chill...) And then we have these stupid teens. Now, as a rule, teens in horrorflicks aren't all that bright, but these ones seemed to be particulary stupid. "Oh my... my boyfriend went into that house and doesn't come out... maybe I should go check?" ... right... I salute leatherface, those kids deserved to die... it's darwinism in action. This movie, just as many others are purely surviving on their initial hype. There is NOTHING special about this movie. You might as well catch any other 70's horrorflick, since this one only scares the weakest of heart...2/10 for this piece o' crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To say that the texas chainsaw massacre is based on a true story is like saying that a frog and a toad is the same thing... Since the story they say that the film is based on is the story of a necrophile named Ed Gein, and is the same story that they say that The silence of the lamb is based on too, it should be pretty evident that it's not really a true story. Ed Gein was an alienated man who dug up some corpses (well quite a lot of them...) and made clothes and furniture out of them, but he NEVER killed anyone even though some people thinks he did... even though Ed Gein was a very sick man he was no leatherface and he wasn't any Buffalo Bill either. Now having my point said I think that at least some people gets to know that a true story isn't always a true story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>APOILERS ABOUNDSaw this film for the first time last night and I was dissapointed. We start off with five terrible actors. None of these kids make you like them. Wheelchair boy is the biggest whiner I've ever seen in my life. I couldn't believe what I was seeing when he starting sticking his tongue out and spitting at the ceiling for an extended period of time. That was pathetic. None of the other actors are any better. Once they start getting killed off, you don't really care. In fact, I was rooting for Leatherface to put them out of their misery. And therein lies problem number two: this is one of the slowest-moving films I've seen in a long time. We wait forever for anything of any value to happen. So many scenes and specific shots spend a prolonged period of time focusing on something that doesn't matter. It makes for a very frustrating experience waiting for the first victim. When it does come, the three follow so quickly that you don't really have much time to appreciate what just happened. Maybe the best scene of the movie is when one of the chicks is hanging on a hook watching her boyfriend get sawed into pieces. But even that isn't all that great. Before too long, all but one of the teens is dead and she spends, what, about half an hour running around in circles while some fatso with a chainsaw chases her. And this is supposed to be scary or entertaining? I think not. All the screaming and not watching where you're going just got on my nerves. We get to see Leatherface's family and next to no time is spent on them. Why are they so screwed up? What role has the father (or grandfather, for that matter) played in making the two boys the way they are? There are subtle hints but nothing conclusive. Once the chick finally escapes their clutches, we come to maybe the most retarded part of the entire movie. A truck runs over one brother, Leatherface then chases chick and truck driver around the semi with chainsaw wailing, chick jumps in the back of a passing pickup, and Leatherface flails his weapon around, evidently in anguish that the chick escaped. We never see who the driver of the pickup is, we never see what happens to the truck driver, the movie just ends with Leatherface whipping that chainsaw around in the morning sun. A neat ending might have found the pickup the chick jumped into belonging to....oh my goodness, Leatherface's father!! That's what I thought when I first saw the truck. But instead it just kind of ends. We don't really know what to think. I mean, what was the point of this movie? It wasn't scary, we didn't care when the teens got killed because they were all whiny, spoiled brats, we didn't care about Leatherface and his family because we really learn nothing about them...it's an exercise in the pointless, if you ask me.Many consider this a classic but I consider it trash. Perhaps it was more disturbing back in the days of its original release on the big screen but today it does nothing for me. I hated House of 1000 Corpses but it was much better than TCM.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I kept hearing people talking about this one. Either it was really good, or really bad. I found it to be a pretty good horror flick. Not too much gore as one might expect by the title, but all in all it didn't disappoint. A group of teens are driving through Texas (I don't know why the plot outline says they are hippies) so a brother and sister can make sure a grave of a relative is undisturbed. Apparently, a lot of bodies have been dug up in the cemetery and some of the bodies have even been put in crude poses. The brother is confined to a wheelchair...also along for the drive is the sister's boyfriend and another young couple. After the cemetery they drive along and see a hitchhiker and decide to pick him up. This would be mistake number one for these rather stupid teens, but hey they are teens so it is realistic that they would be incredibly dumb. The hitchhiker seems friendly enough at first, but later goes crazy so they dump him and continue on. They then hit a gas station, but there is no gas. Despite the attendant there basically telling them they would be better off not going to any houses in the area because of the people in the area, the teens do anyway as they go to a house that used to belong to the brother and sister's grandfather. Once there the couple goes for a swim, but there is no water in the swimming hole, so they go to the neighbors who might have gas and also have a bunch of cars underneath camouflage. This would tip off most of us to get the heck out, but no the teens proceed to walk right in the house and get killed by Leatherface. One complaint about this movie is that I think the killings could have been spaced out a bit more, but overall it was a rather good flick. Though it is pretty sad to watch the teens basically walk right into Leatherface's house and get whacked off. Only the blond caused him any trouble. I also wasn't thrilled when Leather face the gruesome killer didn't even seem to be the head of his strange family, but I can overlook that. This one almost plays out like a snuff film at times, and it is hard to see in some areas, but this just enhances the mood in the movie. All in all a good movie and a lot, lot, lot better than the only other Texas I have seen...part 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] Before I start, I would like to let you who haven't seen this movie know that it isn't as bad as it sounds. I mean, you hear a title like Texas Chainsaw Massacre and immediately think it's about people being chopped to pieces by a chain saw, well that isn't so. In fact, only one person is killed with a chain saw in the entire movie! So it isn't as gory as it sounds. A group of friends, Sally Hardesty, her brother Franklin, Jerry, Kirk and Pam were traveling through rural Texas. They were visiting a relative of Sally's. Along the way, they pick up a hitchiker. This man seemed very, VERY strange. He talked about how they now kill cattle at the meat processing plants. He took a picture of Franklin and asked $5.00 for it. When nobody would pay, he set the picture on fire! Next, he took out a knife and cut himself. His stop comes up soon luckily. But now the friends' van is low on gas and the station is out. They settle in an old abandoned house. Kirk, Pam and Jerry go to a neighboring house and are all captured by a crazy man wearing a mask of human flesh! The man's name is Leatherface. He hangs the kids on meat hooks in the kitchen! The house is filled with human skeletons. There was even furniture made out of them! Next, Leatherface goes after Sally and Franklin. He kills Franklin with his chain saw. Sally runs to the gas station, which is run by Dreyton Sawyer. Sawyer ties up Sally and takes her to his house, where Leatherface and the hitchhiker lived as well. They were going to have her for dinner! Their grandfather, though over 154-years-old, remains the best killer around. Though he needed help holding the hammer.  Sally luckily escapes. The hitchhiker get's plowed down by a truck. Sally get's away, leaving Leatherface standing in the road with his chain saw roaring; Leatherface joins Freddy, Jason, Chucky and Michael Myers as one of the most popular cinema mass murderers in history. What's going on in the movie may not make sense at times, but in order to enjoy these films or any horror film out there, you gotta forget logic. If you haven't seen it already, see it! And don't let the title throw you!-</fullReview>

Director Tobe Hooper was just great.The scene at the table with LeatherFace and his family and Sally(Marilyn Burns) was just twisted.People say after watching this movie you won't wanna eat meat, that's not true.This is a classic in every sense of the wordI give The Texas Chain Saw Massacre 10/10</fullReview>

Kids, what's in that popcorn? Poor aunty Mame scans the screen in vain for Vivien Leigh. She has been cruelly misled but mercifully has forgotten her glasses. In one memorable scene a dirty, long haired, gibbering freak is given a lift by some Scooby Doo kids and drools over them, cuts himself and then goes beserk with a knife. Suddenly the family remembers they've left dad behind at the petrol station. Sadly, the director was thwarted and the film got a 17. In the UK it barely got a release at all. Oh, well, back to Walt Disney.TCM is vivid but too preposterous to be truly frightening. Love that glowing lampshade at the dinner table, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", made in 1974, has influenced numerous people and established itself as a classic of its genre. While watching it, I could not figure out why. All that I saw was a poor excuse for blood to be shed. Director Tobe Hooper can direct a good movie, as he proved 8 years later with "Poltergeist". But with this, his first film, he faltered and faltered badly. Basically, he has taken an hilariously bad plot (based on a true story!), combined it with some terrible acting, and the end result is almost despisable. Yes, I'm aware that the low budget couldn't call upon big name performers, but I found myself laughing at some of this film. And it's reputation of being one of the most gory films ever made is sorely misguided. Check out another, far better low budget film called "The Evil Dead" if gore is what you're looking for. "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is realistic, but that alone does not make it a good movie. In fact, this one aspect is the only positive thing that I could fathom from this entire motion picture. So if you enjoy hearing a girl screaming almost non-stop for about 40 minutes, this is for you, but everyone else should stay a clear distance away.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, albeit overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre tells the story of five friends that are driving across Texas on a road trip. When they stop to visit an old house where two of them, a girl and her brother, grew up, their day goes horribly wrong. All of them are quickly dispatched by a chainsaw wielding maniac, and the last survivor is taken hostage by the maniac's family of cannibals. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a the "classic" that started the slasher genre, but it is overrated.I have infinite respect for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, because it is a cheesy low budget film that director Tobe Hooper had to struggle to make, dealing with the hot Texas sun and his low budget, and yet he was able to churn out a cult classic that is still loved today. What I like about The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is that it paints a very disturbing picture. It's not the bubblegum horror movie you'd see nowadays. It's psychologically disturbing. It blasts your senses with sights and sounds you'll find very disturbing a graphic. The chilling score is made up of various sounds you'll hear in a slaughter house. The whole movie is very claustrophobic, with the camera getting super close-ups of the victim's eye, and the camera cutting to random, disturbing images in the middle of a scene. The movie is very disturbing that way.What I don't like is the way the plot pans out. It is far too simplistic. The people who are killed die too soon into the film, and it all happens too fast. The last half hour or so of the movie is the last survivor screaming non-stop, and it gets annoying. I also didn't like how certain scenes are so dark you can't even see them. This may have been done for effect, but it only ruined the experience for me. Obviously the acting isn't even close to good, but what can you expect from a low budget 70's horror.Overall, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is an okay movie to watch, and it deserves respect, but I just don't think it's the cinematic masterpiece everyone says it is.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!2003...within less than a year, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre will turn 30 years old. I find this very hard to believe because this movie hasn't aged a single day. And although cinema has gone through a major evolution in the past 30 years, most nowadays thrillers don't come even close to TCM when it comes to atmosphere and "creepyness". This is horror in the purest possible form and it'll rank always high on the list of movies that influenced cinema the most. That's probably why some suckers have decided to remake it... By the end of this year, a new TCM will be shown in theaters and I ask you why ? Is it to satisfy younger fans and blow them away with stunning visuals and sound effects. That isn't necessary at all. The original still has the ability to impress any public...and how !!! The most powerful aspect about this movie is without a doubt the choice of the innocent victims. The diabolical family didn't intend to chase the group of youngsters, they just happened to be there and fell into their hands. It could have been anybody. This form of random terror is usual stuff nowadays but back in 1974, this scared a lot of people. Of course there are many other great elements to find in TCM. For example Leatherface and the rest of his family...( including the Chainsaw ). Never in this movie is really explained what drives them to such madness. Sure you can make up many theories about the fact the closure of the slaughterhouse and such but you'll never a 100 % sure about the origin of the madness. They're freaking maniacs and you don't want to come across them. Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one big thrill, in fact. The grave robbing, the terrifying news bulletins and the demonic house ...all these elements contribute in making this movie one of the most memorable and important films ever !TCM is loosely ( better say VERY loosely ) based on a true story. That is to say : Leatherface owes his existence to the horrible serial killer Ed Gein. Without a doubt the most influential psychopath in American history as he was also the base for other horror milestones such as Norman Bates and Hannibal Lector. We have Tobe Hooper and Kim Henkel to thank for all the rest of this terrific movie. They've created this low budget piece of cinema and by doing that, they changed the horror industry forever. Tobe Hooper continued making good horror during the 70 ( Eaten Alive ) and in the early 80's he even was a star for a little while ! Steven Spielberg let him direct his production Poltergeist which was a huge success as well.TCM is coming straight from the best horror decade: The 70's. Very recently we've this discussed this wonderful 10 years of horror here on the message boards of this website. The amount of highlights in this decade is incredible and almost impossible to list...You've got The Exorcist, Halloween, Suspiria, The Omen, The Wicker Man, Last house on the Left, Dawn of the Dead and tons of other immortal titles. Texas Chainsaw Massacre sure is one of them. This version will always be superior...even if the make 10 remakes and a 1.000 more rip-offsGreatest "rewind"-moment : The character of Pam who fall down in the Leatherface house. When she looks around the camera follows her view and you see nothing but human bones ! Terrific piece of horror</fullReview>

I don't know what people see in this movie, because honestly, it was awful. There was literally no plot, the acting sucked, and there was virtually no violence.

		<shortDescription>Doesn't comepletely hold up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should preface my review with this, I am 18 years old, BUT I was practically raised on classic horror films. This one however, in my opinion, has more cons than pros. PROS: The film's cinematography is amazing, especially with it's low budget. The imagery is fantastic and sets up a very nice atmosphere. Some of the scenes, mostly the chase scenes, are sort of intense. The premise is great because we are diving in to this insane world we don't understand with the people that get stuck in this situation. CONS: I DON'T GIVE A CRAP ABOUT THESE PEOPLE! I say the chase scenes are sort of intense because I don't really care if this dumb bimbo makes it away. You'd think with this premise they would try to make us care about these characters but they are such cut outs and acted so woodenly that I wouldn't care. I would just take it as a regular splatter flick but the beginning is practically repeating itself beat for beat. I did sort of enjoy the last 20 minutes because it sort of became a bizarre black comedy. I believe that back in 1974, this would have been terrifying, but I just don't think it holds up these days as it sort of becomes a laughable incoherent mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>cynical world encapsulated in terror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so at first glance, "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" is a gore fest. Of course there's a lot more to it than that. Filmed amid an America mired in cynicism from the Vietnam War and the burgeoning Watergate scandal (which had forced Nixon to resign before the movie's release), "TTCSM" is sort of a time capsule. The optimism of the '50s and '60s had given way to an era of hijackings and suspicion of the government. Therefore, when the group of young people goes to the house and finds that the inhabitants have only the most vicious designs on them, it perfectly represents what millions of young people came to realize. The ugly reality of this one house is nothing compared to the lie that was American society. In that sense, "TTCSM" is as much an indictment of American society as "The Graduate" is.Of course, it's very easy to ignore all that. Watching the movie, a person can take a lot of pleasure in the blood and guts. Incredibly gross, but very relevant to its era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A weak horror film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really disappointed at the end of this movie. I felt as though the director was trying to make a movie, but failed to in an interesting way. None of the characters were interesting, well I do admit the only character I found interesting was the hitchhiker. I loved the way he was portrayed, and the way the actor was confident in his role enough to come out as a genuine loon. The rest of the cast, although they were good actors, the characters were poorly written, we didn't get to know them enough to form a temporary bond with them, therefore the movie fell flat around the 70 minute mark when I realized the director was only trying to fill his film with enough minutes to be classified as a movie. Having let loose the bad foundation this movie has been built over, I can honestly say there are some terrific elements that has been a blueprint for the future horror genre. Not only was the chase scene between Leatherface and Sally terrifying, it was exhausting to watch and exhilarating to experience. This particular scene will be glued to my mind for a while, and for the first time in 10 years I woke up in the middle of the night after watching this movie, due to a nightmare about this one scene. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, in my honest opinion, would have done just fine as a short film. It was okay as a full length movie, but the story was a terrible fault of which the horror had to make up for. A great horror movie has not only gore, violence and horror, a great horror movie has a captivating plot and likable characters with some thrills thrown into the blender. This unfortunately, was only half of what makes a great horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know this is the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and I'm usually all about "Originals being better than sequels". But I think this movie is somewhat overrated. I like this movie a lot, don't get me wrong. But it shouldn't be praised as the greatest movie ever. I cannot say that the story line is overused and boring because this movie came out long before all the knock off movies did, it even beat Halloween by about 4 years. If There was anything in particular I didn't like about this movie, it would be the pacing. Some scenes were dragged on a little too long. Like Sally sitting in her chair screaming...OK, shes scared, we get it. But it showed her screaming for about 10 minutes, and to be honest, I had to turn the volume down as it was hurting my ears. The chase scene was pretty good, but again dragged on a little bit too long there. Franklin trying to get around and stuff, we get hes handicapped already, leave the poor guy alone, the scene where they were all giggling upstairs while he was crying downstairs was unneeded. And that stupid hippy, Jerry didn't make it much better. Why didn't Sally stop hangin around him? He was rude to her brother yet she stuck to him like a magnet. OK, Im ranting again This movie was great, it was better than the 4th one, but I think the 2nd and 3rd ones beat this one. 6/10</fullReview>

We couldn't stop talking about it.The chase scenes were a complete pants wetter. The sound of the saw itself created that fearful vibe. They didn't have to SHOW it, just IMPLY it.The Ed Gein connection was kind of cool. And I liked the typically Texan style of life.Best actor? Jim Seidow (R.I.P.) as the cook. But Ed Neal still nearly stole this film.Gunnar and Marilyn (Leatherface and Sally Hardesty) did brilliant work too. And make no wrong thought here, this film is an ICON in horror.See it again and again. I did. And I am.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Tobe Hooper made an instant classic when he shot this grainy shaky little film.It has spawned a million imitations and continues to influence horror films to this day.This is one that true horror fans have watched over and over.In fact my own fascination with horror films is basically me trying to find one that is as scary and eerie and memorable as TCM.This film concerns a group of young folks and their attempt to survive an encounter with a crazy killer family.The setting is great---an old run down house out in the middle of nowhere in Texas.All the details of the bones and weird objects in that dusty dimly lit old house add to the eerie feeling.This is the film that gave us Leatherface----he has had a ton of imitators but none have even come close to the sheer terror of this pudgy chainsaw wielding madman in the leather apron and leather face running after us.The smoke from the chainsaw and the Texas dust swirled around him and forever that image is imprinted into horror fan's brains.The gnawing buzz of a chainsaw is the soundtrack of horror fan's worst nightmare because of this film.When I first saw Leatherface slide open that metal door and use that hammer I was forever hooked on horror films and have ever since been looking for the great ones.And this one is the greatest of them all.Leatherface dancing in the setting sun accompanied by his chainsaw is one of the most evil images in film history.There have since been much gorier horror films and some horror films have spent millions on special effects and none of them have ever come close to reproducing the horror or terror or the legendary status of this little grainy unevenly lit film.See it for yourself some night with all the lights out and let Leatherface show you how it's done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Horror films Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, without a doubt, is one of the scariest films I have ever seen. Tobe Hooper uses psychological horror to keep us right on the edge of our seats, as we watch in suspense wondering what will happen next. The film is about a group of kids, one of them being Sally Hardesty, and her crippled brother Franklin. People have been digging up graves here recently, so she, along with her friends and brother, go up to the graveyard to see if they're grandfather's grave has been tampered with. When they get there, they see that his grave is fine. They then go to Sally's grandfathers old house. They're van breaks down at the house, so they decide to go get help. When they do, they end up bumping into a family of cannibals that want to eat them for lunch.I would now like to clear up the rumors. THIS FILM IS NOT GORY AT ALL! So many people are disappointed by this film because it has this reputation of being very violent and gory. It is indeed a terrifying movie, but no gore.Marilyn Burns gives an EXCELLENT performance at the roll of Sally. It's sad that she didn't do more after this. She slowly goes crazy as she tries to get away from the family of cannibals, and her performance is so believable! This film is a must see for any horror fans. A must must must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has some nice moments, but does not deliver in the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1974 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' from director Tobe Hooper is better than the 2003 remake, but that doesn't make this movie good. We follow five teenagers in a van, heading for something I did not really understand. May the house they end up was already their final destination, because of events it will be. The first half of the movie shows how the five take a hitchhiker (Edwin Neal) who cuts himself with a knife and continues with cutting one of the five. After they have ditched the hitchhiker, so they think, they go to an old abandoned house.Two of them, Pam (Teri McMinn) and Kirk (William Vail), go for a swim, but find out the water is not there anymore. They go to an old house for gas and disappear. Jerry (Allen Danziger) is the next one to disappear when he wants to find Pam and Kirk. Siblings Sally (Marilyn Burns) and Franklin (Paul A. Partain), the guy who was cut by the hitchhiker and is in a wheelchair, wait until dark, the perfect time to get worried. They start looking for the other three and then Franklin gets massacred by a guy with a chainsaw (Gunnar Hansen). Sally runs for the second half of the movie, although she is caught a couple of times and escapes a couple of times.I have told you a lot and nothing at the same time. That certain people will die is a given; it is more how it happens and the uncertainty of what happens to Sally that makes this movie suspenseful. Although I wasn't really scared I thought there were some interesting parts. The way the camera photographs the house where the teens disappear and how it shows the eyes of Sally when she is in the middle of the horror gave me a chilly feeling. Still, this wasn't enough for me to please a horror film.The movie is good in a way it doesn't want to explain the actions of a killer, although we can simply speak of a madman's actions, and it doesn't dramatize either. We see what happens and move on to the next act and we see what happens there. The atmosphere is good in the first half as well. Where suspense builds up there, giving us a feeling that something big is about to happen, the all-running, all-screaming second half does not deliver. May be some will be petrified, terrified and horrified, I was not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid, disappointing, annoying, repetitive, boring.. Just a few words the film critic may use to describe the picture they disliked.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All these are the words i have mentioned will be used to describe The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, possibly one of the worst films i have ever seen.Stupid: The plot is so annoying. 5 "kids" are going through a deserted Texas looking for a gravesite of relatives. As they wonder into and around an abandoned house, they decide to visit another house not too far away. As they do, they are brutally murdered by a large man in a leather face mask for no reason what-so-ever. The film proceeds with about 20 minutes of chasing through bushes and long grass with the reving of a chainsaw.Disappointing: I've heard so much about the film, how it's shocking, scary and amazingly violent. Nonsense. When i began watching i expected an amazing film which completely ran all over the genre of Horror and created a new genre. All this hype was stupid an unnecessary. Sometimes i laughed at how poor it was.Repetitive and boring: The chasing. So much chasing in pitch black, so you're unable to see anything but some light. This chasing goes on for over 10 minutes at least.. With screaming, and the non-stop sound of the chainsaw revving.. That's when i got very bored. After that, yet more chasing happened and long scenes of nothingness repeated themselves.So? What is good about it? The first 15 minutes or so are entertaining.. When they pick up a crazy hitch hiker. I won't give it away, but i think you may laugh at it.I can't imagine how the horror fan could like it at all either. I can't imagine how this film can still have the fame today that it had many years ago. It just simply doesn't work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic? Of innovation perhaps...not substance!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen this flick on its release, at roughly four year intervals, and again last night on a supposedly "uncut" dvd, my view of the thing remains unchanged. A legend in its own mind! There is nothing even remotely "classic" about this film. Having much the same problem as CABIN FEVER - totally dull and charismaticless individuals whose sole purpose is to die at some stage. In terms of blood and guts, you see far more in the re-make which is a vastly more professional offering and STILL way shy of greatness.Hooper's TCM is just plain dull for the most part. What killings there are are merely glimpsed or suggested, rather than in your face. Even the famed meat-hook scene is far better handled in the remake. Hooper blew his creative wad on the solar flares imagery which might be seen as a catalyst for the madness.....but hell, these inbreds have been at it for generations. TCM, like Craven's LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is more an exercise in tasteless film-making than an authentic recreation of an actual event which my friends, this is NOT. It is very loosely based on a case-file. One that did NOT include "Leatherface" or his absurdly fanciful grandpa who appears to have wandered straight off the set of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.The film remains however a tribute to Marilyn Burns tonsils which are put to high-decibal use during the concluding 20 minutes. TCM is exactly what it looks - low budget, low relevance horror...sorry, screaming!HALLOWEEN blows it away!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having had this film hyped and its critical appraisal raised in recent years I decided to give this 'cult classic' a look. Having been on a banned film list in England and only recently removed, I can now see why.The gore level may not be high in terms of modern day slasher movies but its power to shock still remains. However the film has an unnerving nastiness about it and dirty feel to it all that makes the flesh creep. It is quite distasteful with little or no logic or explanation to all the events at all.If it is based at all on fact then this at least gives it some 'reason', however by all accounts this is tenuous to say the least.Overall this is a bad film with few redeeming features, to laud it as some classic does not do justice to the true classics of this genre or any other come to that. Give this a wide berth and watch Psycho instead.</fullReview>

For what they had to work with its not a bad film. When it came out in 74 it must have been a fresh and original film. It's been copied so many different ways by other movies and I consider that flattery. My wife jumped a few times and she never does that with movies, and you could see where the Blair Witch got the scary idea of running threw woods from this movie. Cutting to the chase, what scares the viewer is some crazy chasing you with a chainsaw. Its been done before with guns, knifes, and masks, but a chainsaw threw the woods, at night ads extra for the film. Its low budget,there is no Michael Cane in this film, and by far its not a 10. This film compensates with camera angles (close ups of eye balls) and urban stories about events that happen in different parts of the country.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There has been a time that I wasn't really that fond of horror films, finding some had cheap excessive gore, bad acting and scripting and a lack of genuine thrills and suspense. I couldn't have been more wrong, some of the best of the genres are anything but these. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the best, it screams horror classic from the character Leatherface to the many times it's been imitated/parodied but never equalled. I think the use of the documentary-style realism is masterful, and the fact it is low-budget makes no difference to me, in fact to me this adds to the gritty, harsh and creepy tone this film conveys. The gore is not at all excessive, in fact its count is quite low, and when it is used, it never feels cheap or gimmicky. The script is razor sharp, the story is compelling and Tobe Hooper's direction is probably Texas Chainsaw Massacre's strongest asset. I was fine with the acting as well, Leatherface is genuinely unnerving. In conclusion, a classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely the Biggest Let Down of Any Movie I've Waited 37 Years to See.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it came out in '74 I was 12, too young to get into the theater, and so I swore I'd find a way to see it somehow. The ads in magazines and on the radio, the poster at the theater, the buzz throughout the country; it just had to be awesome. But so many other things occupied my attention - like sports, like dirt bikes, like art, like girls, like other movies - and so it was soon forgotten. There was no On Demand, or Peer-to-Peer, or even VCR rentals back then so it was easy for a flick to disappear into oblivion.But recently I happen to be reading here on IMDb passionate reviews gushing unlimited praise for this forgotten relic, most of which were written at the time of the release of the 2003 remake. So I clicked over to NetFlix, selected it, and moved it to the top of my queue, eager to experience superlative vintage cinematic terror. A few evenings later and I had it loaded into the player, giddy with anticipation. Soon a scroll of text read aloud by a somber voice informs me that what I was about to witness is in fact a movie. That's right, I was not only reading but being told that the movie I am watching actually is a movie. It then explained that what was to follow was a tragedy, a bizarre crime, and - in case I still wasn't computing - a macabre event. OK, I think I get it. This movie isn't a comedy. It isn't a western. It isn't a bio-pict, or a rom-com, or a tear-jerker. It isn't a period costume piece, or a Danish Clog Dancing Instructional. It's a terror fest, 'cause, well, it just told me it is. OK, got it...But almost immediately, I'm doubting it's spastically worded claim. Even though the initial montage of photo style images of a rotted corpse sitting atop a grave is genuinely bizarre and disturbing, any dramatic tension is completely undercut by a voice over news report from an unseen radio. Whatever horror the grisly visuals create is diluted in the tediously obvious, and ultimately irrelevant vocal drone. Why tell me what I'm seeing is ghastly and horrible when I may already be thinking it? That's just stupid. Bad story telling, bad movie making. And it just gets stupider.To read the top viewer comments on IMDb you could only think that this was art of the highest order, that it pulses with a hideous dark force that penetrates the deepest recesses of the human soul. These ardently worded essays extol the film's unparalleled psychological intensity and ultra-shocking realism. Comparisons abound to Night Of The Living Dead, Last House On The Left, and even The Exorcist - films which in fact still haunt me, even at my presumably mature stage in life. Some fans are keyed up on the contemporaneous events that they claim inform the film with grander, deeper philosophical resonance, such as the Vietnam war, or even the Watergate scandal. Really? Really?!...The Deranged Hitchhiker that the un-hip gang picks up is then perhaps meant to embody the dark, irrational forces of nature - a scrawny wild eyed Bogeyman - but he is just way too spastic and goofy to instill terror or even fear. He's just an absurd cartoon character; any decent spoof film would be glad to have him as comic relief. Whatever horrors await the doomed group would probably be equally spastic and anticlimactic. I was actually hoping the comical freak would dispatch the kids right then and there, as a poignant lesson to our nation's tender sweet gentle youth to be more wary of obviously murderous country bumpkin hitchhikers. But to witness their inevitable and deserved demises I was made to wait.The wait isn't justified, as the ensuing scenes are impotent in creating much tension. A possible skinny dipping scene - the pinnacle of slasher film necessity - is inexcusably preempted by a sudden first encounter with the famed masked madman. Much more than shocked at the carnage that was occurring I was p$@#ed off that I'd been robbed of the essential gratuitous nudity. Seriously! Don't tease me like that and then expect me to maintain sympathy. Jeez. "Oh look, a big weird guy with a big hammer just whacked jean-shirt dude" I chuckled to myself. OK, that happened... So this is the unconscionable terror that had stricken the nation? Victim #1's girly friend then stumbles into the Masked One's clutches and is treated like a side of beef, made to witness the dissection of her paramour. Serves you right, you silly tease. It's then that we are granted our first audience with the dreaded instrument of mayhem, The Chainsaw. Oooooooh...The film still believes I care what happens to the bra-less blond chick and her whiny chubby brother. I don't, since they have alienated me with their tedious personalities. And since Blondie has been shamelessly taunting me the whole time with her prodigious and thinly concealed mammaries, I am feeling for her a certain amount of contempt. She's not gonna really show 'em, is she? No, she isn't. This isn't a thoughtfully reasoned, emotionally competent story, is it? No, it isn't.There IS a pocket watch with a spike driven through its face that the camera inspects while I think to myself "Uh, so." And there ARE a lot of dry, clean, dangling animal skeletons that someone seems to think are spooky. This zombie of a flick doesn't have enough meat on its bones to qualify as either a slasher/thriller or a goofy gross out fest.Oh yeah, then there's the scene where Big Boobed Blondie is chased by the chainsaw fellow, her relentless screaming and the rasp of the power tool blending to make mellifluous magical music. Will he get her? I hope so... For THIS I waited 37 years?!</fullReview>

I was surprised though with the lack of actual story in the original. I understand the shock value of it probably in 1974 so I give it props for that, but there simply wasn't much actually explained. It actually made me appreciate the remake even more because of what story it added to it and developed further. In the original,the kids travel, the kids die; and what was with that grandpa?! I give it five starts mainly because of the inspiration it gave to the remake, which despite others opinions of it, remains one of my favorite horror films of all time.</fullReview>

I must have just had a hallucination in which I watched one of the worst "horror" movies ever.Okay, so, in all seriousness, what do people like about this film?It's not suspenseful. It's not scary. It's not entertaining. The acting isn't bad, but that doesn't make a movie.It starts nowhere, and goes nowhere. The characters are boring, the story is boring. They walk around and talk for an hour, then they die. No suspense whatsoever. There are three good things about this movie: 1) The title. Very awesome. 2) Some of the scenes in the house. The bones, the hook scene, all okay. 3) The dinner scene at the end. Props for that, it's the best part of the film.I like old horror movies. I really do. But this piece of junk? I have no idea what all the hype is about. It's really, really, really bad. Put this on next time you're having trouble falling asleep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people went a summer tour with their car. Suddenly it will be their trip a nightmare.It is bad actors and bad directing.Tobe Hooper have made better movies than Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a very sick and bestial Horror-movie. I think it is enough with a one Texas Chainsaw Massacre, because I mean it is absurd to make three Texas Chainsaw Massacre-movies after a bad Horror-movie which is also a Classic from 1974.It is too much brutal violence and I can't understand how they can show of this sort of Horror-movies.It is very beautiful views and nature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing any horror fan who is wanting to see this needs to know is that its very overrated. I recently brought the DVD expecting something special, as I enjoyed the remake and figured this could only be better. Wrong.Yes, its filmed in a highly unnerving style, almost like a documentary, but this doesn't work as well as it could. The characters a feebly drawn out; one in particular is so annoying you will actually cheer when he gets sliced up, which, unfortunately, is not until near the end.However, the moment this character disappears, the film picks up. The last ten minutes are truly disturbing, with a fantastically done 'family dinner' scene, and the final chase.Its sad when a classic horror film is outdone by its remake, but the truth is TCM 2003 was a far superior film. This one is not really scary or suspenseful at all until the end. To be fair, neither was the remake, but that one was so damn entertaining you didn't care anyway. Too bad the same can't be said here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tobe Hooper has done better! the Funhouse was scary. it was also a good horror classic. this is just about a big guy in a mask made of human flesh that nails people with a sludge hammer and his chainsaw. he actually only killed one victim with the chainsaw. its also about the demented people in the house and the decayed looking grandpa that is still alive.so you know the story: teens get trapped,get tortured, get killed. the ending was the only good part. all and all this wasn't that great.

		<fullReview>My friend told me that "The Texas chain saw massacre" is far from being actually scary but it is an excellent horror comedy. I had hard times of believing him because of the bad reputation this movie has but when I saw the film I was surprised to find out that he was absolutely right. I guess it would be a difficult job to make a functional parody of this little classic because it's so foolish movie it's already parody of itself. Plot, characters, lines - everything is so incredibly comical I couldn't help of laughing.The fact that this is supposed to be one of the most gruesome and terrifying horror movies ever, makes it even funnier. I think this is a splendid flick. Sick, maybe. Grotesque, from time to time perhaps. Still, very often hilarious. There's no way I'm gonna say "The Texas chain saw massacre" is frightening. If that's what it's supposed to be then sorry Tobe Hooper but it didn't work for me. But thanks anyway for a good laugh, it's always welcome!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did this movie really scare anyone? Then you must be 10 or younger. The movie was soooo slow, so dull, so boring, nothing really happened, and up to to end credits you wait for some suspension. But you will wait in vain. Or did I miss the "scariest-movie-ever"-part? What else is wrong with this movie? Well, the horrible cast for example. I don't remember having seen worse acting and flater characters in a long time. OK, that "family" sure is worth a cheap laugh or two, but nothing more.This is definitely Hooper's worst movie, but since it was his first one, he can be forgiven. If you want a good Hooper movie to give you the creeps, watch 'Poltergeist' instead!I give this movie 3/10, one for its famous title, one for this funny cannibal family and one for being only 75 minutes, thus not wasting too much of my time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best part of this movie: It inspired the remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a classic, I will give it that. However, I really, really disliked this film. In my opinion it sucks, and I can overlook many things if I enjoy the killers, but even that was lacking.THE GOOD: It created Leatherface, inspired the remake and helped launch the 2006 prequel, thats the best thing this movie has ever done in my opinion. The idea of a hulking, skin wearing, mute, brutish killer was genius and pretty original for the day.THE BAD: The film is way too slow moving. It focuses on unnecessary things far too much. In one instance Pam stumbles into a bone filled room that seems to stink from her reaction, but still she waits for a stupid amount of time just so the camera can pan around unnecessarily at the bones. Also, this film keeps character development (what there was of it) in the first half mainly on the most annoying character of the film, Franklin. Franklin was so annoying that if he wasn't in a wheelchair there would be nothing sad about seeing him bite the dust. In fact, I can see his death as a relief for some viewers. And even the other characters are lame. Jerry and Sally were laughing while talking about Sally's grandmother dying, Kirk found it amusing to pick up some nasty tooth and hand it to his girlfriend, and Sally wouldn't stop screaming! The sound quality is horrible, it took me like 10 views to figure out that Leatherface was laughing during the scene before he hooked Pam. The hitchhiker silently howls by the side of the road, and the dialogue on occasion seem like mumbles.Even though the basic idea of Leatherface was genius, it was seriously detracted from by the "retard" persona they chose to use. Why should I be afraid of someone who doesn't know why things happen and is even afraid of me? Squealing like a pig, acting stupid, he really didn't seem to know why things even happened. The new Leatherface acts more like real killers. In fact, he acted a lot like a mute BTK. In my opinion the remake/prequel Leatherface is superior in intelligence, looks, and demeanor. Speaking of looks, the house didn't look as good as the remake house in my opinion, neither did the setting. Last, I hate the soundtrack! Well, what there was of one.So whats the best part of this movie? It introduced Leatherface and inspired the remake and prequel. Other than that its the worst kind of a pointless film, one that made a lot of money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amateurish, uncaptivating, and completely unworthy of its status as a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, note the title. When one thinks "massacre," one would expect a lot of murder, gore, and (at least attempted) scary scenes, wouldn't one? One would. Yet, we follow the travels of an incredibly uninteresting group of only five, and we never see much when they get killed. They talk about pointless garble and we don't connect with them. (And Franklin was an idiot.)What happens in the movie? No massacre, I assure you. Rather, we get a look at just how little can happen in an hour and a half movie. There is no real plot development, and the movie has zero intrigue to it, leaving me bored and just BEGGING for the ending. The ending, by the way, consisted mostly of the lunatic family dragging everything on and on. The girl screaming hysterically had potential, but it only served to stretch out the scene further. The last scene also had potential but was far too abrupt. It was all just plain uninteresting.Being a fan of classic horror movies like A Nightmare On Elm Street and Friday the 13th, I was very disappointed with The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. However, the fact of the matter is: Either you adore it, or you hate it. You have to decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie came on Film4 here in the UK and because of the hype this movie has generated I decided to watch it. I didn't like it, simple as that, I just didn't see anything in this movie that scared me. The story wasn't even that great for it to be consider a good horror movie.The acting was below-par, It seemed the director had just hand-picked these so called 'actors' off the street and told them to scream endlessly through the full movie. This movie could have been a good if there was more depth in the script, the director should have gave some attention to characters backgrounds, telling the audience more about the family, their history and why they do such things.Not worth a watch if your looking for a good horror movie which you can truly enjoy. The only way I believe there is any reason to watch this movie is if your looking for a laugh with your friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard from many people that the Texas Chainsaw Massacre was the most brutal and shocking horror movie ever. So, I rented it with 5 friends and watched it on a friday night, with high expectations. Let me just first say that this movie is not scary, or intelligent. It's a shame that a movie based on Ed Gein wasn't done better. The movie's portrayal of the Southern United States was terribly overdone. Everyone in the movie seemed like they are inbred or retarded. The only gratifying part of the movie is when the Killer is sideswiped by a tractor trailer. It's a shame the director wasn't. This movie should never have been put out. Anyway, if you want to see a well-done horror flick, rent The Exorcist. It runs circles around this garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" may be the worst excuse for a movie I have ever seen. It is vile, disgusting, sick, and ultimately stupid. Supposedly based on a true story (total fiction though), the movie deals with a cannibalistic family led by the chainsaw-wielding Leatherface. In the film, four young people are methodically hunted down and disposed of in brutal fashions. This is a pure mess of a film that has no message, no redeeming value, and no business even existing. It makes the "Friday the 13th" series look like cinematic magic. Do not waste any of your life on this thing. Worthless on all levels. Turkey (0 out of 5 stars).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will admit that when I first watched this film from director Tobe Hooper (Salem's Lot, Poltergeist), I had some expectation, but I thought it was rubbish. Seeing it again, I've changed my opinion, and I can see why it is a little low-budget masterpiece. Basically five friends: Sally Hardesty (Marilyn Burns), Jerry (Allen Danziger), Franklin Hardesty (Paul A. Partain), Kirk (William Vail) and Pam (Teri McMinn), are driving to a vandalised grandfather's grave (why?). On the way they encounter an insane hitchhiker (Edwin Neal), and they drive past an old slaughter house, and soon enough the van busts. One by one they leave the van to go and find some help, and they all find an old house, where they are all (but one) killed off by the ghoulish Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen), the killer wearing a mask of dead skin and (among other weapons) wielding a chain saw. Eventually only Sally is left alive, and she is taken into the house where she is tied up and at the table with the whole maniac family, Leatherface, the Hitchhiker, the Old man (Jim Siedow) and the really creepy Grandfather (John Dugan) where she is tortured. She does eventually escape the house, being chased by the Hitchhiker, who is run over, and Leatherface with his chain saw, but she manages to escape, and the film ends with Leatherface angrily swinging his chain saw (which some critics see as a phallic object). This is supposed to be a really violent film, deaths that stick out include hit on the head with a sledge hammer, hung on a hook in the back, and obviously mashed up by the chain saw, but you never see any blood spill, it is mainly your imagination that creates these gruesome scenes. The film was banned for some time, and the BBFC refused to give it a certificate, but now it is in the public's eye, it is a must-see horror film. The remake by the way, give it a miss! It was number 8 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It`s Not A Video Nasty - It`s A Black Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE is one of the most infamous films ever made , a film that is often mentioned by people who scapegoat video nasties for much of the world`s problems . This is laughable . And nor does TCM deserve to be lumped together with garbage like I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE and NIGHT OF THE DEMON or all those other video nasties because despite the low budget and technical flaws this is a relatively good film storywise . In fact it`s not really a horror film let alone a video nasty . Okay it follows the same structure as any cheap horror film of having a bunch of teenagers stalked in some dark woods but that`s where the similarity ends . TCM is more similar in tone to DELIVERANCE in having a bunch of city dwellers fight for their lives against rural folk . In fact you could describe it as " Scooby Doo on acid " ! Seriously , think about it , a bunch of pesky kids get mixed up in grave robbing and weird backwoods communities . All it really needs is a great dane and an unshaven youth saying " Yoikes " , in which case the film would have ended with someone pulling off Leatherface`s mask to reveal the sherrif saying " If it wasn`t for those pesky kids ...."So why is TCM so infamous ? It`s because it`s funny . So the humour is in very bad taste , but come on admit it , you laughed when the lad in a wheelchair fell down the hill , you laughed when the hitchhiker started doing his bizarre routine in the van , and you laughed at the end when the truck driver left the rig with that terrified look on his face . You may have felt self disgust for doing so but that`s the whole point about TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE - It`s not a horror film , it`s a black comedy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible! This movie should be chainsaw massacred!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Potentially one of the worst movies I've ever had the misfortune of watching. From the fallacy of it being based on actual events (though it may loosely be based on Ed Gein, Gein never used a chainsaw and worked alone) to the terrible acting (the jolting closeups of Sally screaming towards the end...which lasted way too long, mind you); it wasn't scary at all.I'm not particularly fond of horror movies. Mainly because I don't like getting scared. I'm usually apprehensive when watching any movie that is classified as a horror. I tend to stay away from the genre totally. Watching Texas Chainsaw Massacre was far from scary - it was *DEAD BORING*. The acting was terrible, it was slow, dull and repetitive, there was way too much screaming and running around it reminded me of Scooby Doo, and the whole thing was worthless to watch. The only good part was perhaps Leatherface at the very end. That was quite amusing.Honestly, this movie made me sick not from any kind of gore - but due to the utter crap that it was. It should be banned from all countries so no one can be tricked into thinking it's a good film and watch it. No one deserves to go through such torture. Worst movie ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw massacre (1974) - I like the feel of the movie; it seems like documentary, the radio commentary (news) going on, the music give the movie a great start. But the movie overall is not at all thrilling let alone scary. The murder happens so quickly? The only thrill (to an extent) one can get is in last 20-30 minutes with only one single person actually giving fight.. Maybe they wanted the leatherhead to be unconquerable but when he can do it with so much ease it doesn't give the movie enough thrilling moments .The story is nothing. I know most horror doesn't have any story but they have those chilling moments and thrill to keep one hooked however it fails on that account for most part of the movie.. Acting wise though over the top I like the actor who played hitchhiker ? he appeared complete maniac, insane .. Other characters were neither developed nor did anything actually to speak of. The leather face's first appearance was good and intriguing but overall disappointed with his character as well . here I would like to appreciate the art director he has done credible job though there are some inconsistencies . The scene where the girl is tied up - screaming and her face(eye ball close up as well) close up was being shot again n again to show the terror and scare but it was irritating as it was repeated for a minute or so . Overall It's a below average movie .I would rate the movie 4.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror flick with a lot of potential falls short.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked TCM the first time I saw it. It scared and disturbed me. On a rewatch, however, I noticed a lot of flaws pertaining to this B-movie slasher flick that cannot be ignored. But before I get to all that, there is a lot to admire about the film: the foreboding atmosphere, Leatherface's first appearance which is shocking and memorable, the Grandpa character, and it's competently made by a filmmaker who knows what he's doing.However, there are some downright frustrating things about the film, the main one being the characters. Unfortunately, the most sympathetic/least annoying characters are killed off first. And then there's Frankie. Oh, Frankie, Frankie, Frankie. I don't know how I could stand him the first time around, but he is such an annoying character, despite him being in a wheelchair. The scene with him refusing to give his sister Sally the flashlight makes me want to punch a kitten in the face, but that's just one of many occasions where I wanted him to die, and, fortunately, he does. Next, there's Sally. She makes the second half of the film almost unbearable to watch. Her constant screaming is an assault to the senses. It may very well rival Michael Bay's action scenes in any of the "Transformer" films in giving you a headache. Seriously, apart from flailing around uselessly, that's all she does in the entire film. As opposed to Laurie in "Halloween," she makes one hell of an incompetent heroine.Furthermore, there isn't much of a plot here. It's pretty uneventful when compared to the 2003 remake. The film doesn't give any chances for the victims to fight back, and they die too easily which I guess is the point to show Leatherface as a big, unstoppable monster or whatever. Where's the fun in that when there's no even playing field though? But maybe this isn't supposed to be a fun, entertaining film. If the filmmakers' job was to scare people, TCM only does so on occasion. Again, having actress Marilyn Burns screaming is more aggravating than scary, and you have villains (the father and brother) who are just as annoying. Overall, TCM has a lot of potential in being a great horror film, but falls short mainly due to its characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest horror films ever made!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is a classic horror film.**SPOILERS**After receiving word that their relatives' graves may have been robbed, Sally Hardesty, (Marilyn Burns) her invalid brother Franklin, (Paul Partain) and their friends Jerry, (Alan Danziger) Kirk, (William Vail) and Pam, (Terri McMinn) drive through Texas to get to the location. While along they way, they get stranded in this strange town, which has a large house on the edge of town. Thinking a break along the nearby creek might be good for them, they stop and look around. As night falls and the rest of the group hasn't returned yet, Sally and Franklin decide to head into the night to look for them. While searching, they run into the chainsaw-wielding maniac Leatherface, (Gunner Hansen) who chases Sally through the woods.The Good News: Wow, this is a great film! Even though Jason may be my favorite slasher villain, Leatherface is the first, so he holds special commendation. He is also one of the more unique killers in that he is based on a real person, the notorious Wisconsin mass murderer Ed Gein. The main differences, of course, being the leather mask and the chainsaw. Both are ingenious weapons for any killer to lay claim to: being the first masked killer in cinema history, and for having the most feared weapon of all time. That mask, the knowledge that it is sewn together from human skin, is completely freaky and scary, and that drained color tone, combined with Hansen's strong performance, make up one scary slasher. Even the other performers in the film are incredible. The family at the end is just a bunch of wackos, and the dinner scene is just completely freaky. It takes a special skill to successfully creep out the audience, and they play it so well that you sometimes wonder if these are actual actors or real insane people that he hires to scare the wits out of the rest of the cast. Even without Leatherface in the picture, it can scare you how good they are. Wow, highlights, where do we start. For me, I can sit till the end of time watching Leatherface chase Sally through the woods, chainsaw blaring, as we all hear her screams running around for at least ten minutes. This is pure suspense genius. All we see is the chase, running through the woods, with Leatherface sometimes cutting up tree branches that probably shouldn't have been cut, but that just makes the scene more suspenseful. It gives her a chance to get farther away, and yet he still manages to catch up with her, and the doom we feel when he is within striking distance and she is barely getting away are some of the scariest scenes in the history of cinema. This even comes after one of the biggest jumps I've ever had. Two people are walking in the woods, talking innocently, when after a while we hear a twig snap. One of them shines a flashlight in the direction of the noise, and from out of the darkness roars Leatherface, chainsaw blaring as loud as he is, and he then slices the first character up in not-very-gory fashion. Even still, the way it's filmed is so carefully planned out that we think we see the actual cutting of the character, but we never see a drop of blood. That is a brilliant twist over our heads, as we expect something and then something completely by surprise happens that shocks us. Leatherface's first on-screen appearance/kill is also a shock for first time viewers. One character goes walking around the house by himself and stumbles over a loose nail in the floor. When he regains his footing, a secret door has opened, and in the middle stands Leatherface, hammer in hand. With one swift blow to the head, he's down. He picks up the carcass, hauls it back into the room, and then just slamming the door shut, where it's loud banging comes as a long shock. I don't even have to use the dinner scene, that is too marvelous for me to spoil here, as I've said too much already. It needs to be seen yourself to know what I mean. Even the last five minutes are simply incredible, action-packed pieces of lunacy that no one in their sane mind could have come up with, and the brilliant acting already mentioned just drive the scene home so well that it gives the viewer goosebumps just thinking about a scene like that. That is how well made this film is.The Bad News: The main problem I have with this film is that Leatherface is not the mass murderer many think he is. We only get five kills in the film, and even worse, only one by chainsaw. Granted, the chainsaw kill is the best one in the film and one of the best in horror history, it still can't make up for the fact that hardly anyone dies in the film. This is a problem that even the remake and nearly all the sequels have in common. A massacre is not five deaths. That can be a bad traffic accident. The storyline needs to be changed so that he has the opportunity to slash up multiple victims. I might be scared of him more if I knew, that in his whole series, he was capable of killing more than one "Friday the 13th" film. These are not body count flicks, so don't be expecting a large cast to be killed off.The Final Verdict: This is a pretty solid film. It is a bona fide classic; it has some great shock moments and one of the better villains in horror history. Just kill more people along the way. That part of the critique should not be taken seriously, though, and this film MUST be seen as soon as possible.Rated R: Violence, mild Language and the murder of a handicapped person</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After leaving a cemetery where their grandfathers remains has been desecrated by grave robbers, an invalid brother &amp; his sister &amp; three friends make the mistake of picking up a crazed hitcher, who attacks one of them &amp; then when their van runs out of gas, they seek help from a house nearby farmhouse that unknown to them, is lived in by the grave robbers, that are not only cannibalistic, but are planning on adding the kids to their menu &amp; their flesh picked bones to their already littered with junk, human &amp; animal bones cluttered house, while being led by Leatherface, a human skin wearing, chainsaw wielding maniac! The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is perhaps the best horror film ever made! It's terrifying &amp; unnervingly suspenseful! What makes the film work is the fine performances by the cast, who really perform their roles well (Even though the characters aren't that fleshed out) &amp; TOBE HOOPER'S direction is perfection, clever &amp; highly original. Another thing I liked is how Tobe opens his movie up, with quick snap shots of the desecrated bodies at night, as the maniacs photograph them &amp; then onto a shot of a badly decomposing corpse, holding a half severed skull, while wired to a large monument, followed by a shot of a dead armadillo &amp; nothing but constant bad news on the radio, followed by a few town weirdo's &amp; soon to be butchered farm animals, that is set the tone for what will happen as the film goes on. GUNNAR HANSEN is absolutely terrifying as Leatherface, easily the best actor to ever portray the character. No matter how many times you seen this movie (&amp; I seen it plenty of times) Hansen's presence still scares you, even when you know what is going to happen &amp; when &amp; it often makes me think that with another actor portraying him, if the film would have even turned out half as good. The suspense scenes are well executed &amp; milked for maximum impact, with the final two chase scenes both of which involve the lead heroine &amp; Leatherface, has to be the most terrifying chase scenes ever committed to film! The films documentary like look &amp; feel, makes this film feel awfully authentic, it feels almost like a snuff film, of an event that actually happened with the footage unearthed a few years later &amp; that also helps make the film a cut above most, if not all horror efforts. JIM SIEDOW is perfection as the eldest brother, who switches from kind &amp; caring, especially when the lead heroine is captured &amp; is begging him to release her, with his face showing traces of disgust &amp; shame &amp; sympathy for the terrified heroine &amp; what he &amp; his brothers are doing &amp; then back to the terrifying, unsympathetic lunatic his alter ego portrays. MARILYN BURNS perhaps one of the most terrific actresses to ever grace a horror film, is able to nail her part dead on. But perhaps Chainsaw's biggest accomplishment, is the fact that despite claims to the contrary, it's not anywhere near as gory, hideous, or a "splatter film" as we think of such these days. it's not there! Chainsaw has almost no gore on hand, with the exception of Leatherface getting his leg cut with a chainsaw, a slit finger, a knife across the arm &amp; a bloodied Marilyn Burns at the end, some blood on the wall &amp; on a flashlight. Like only the best horror films can do, Chainsaw has so much suspense &amp; tension leading up to the kills &amp; is so strong in it's execution, that when the kills do happen, their done quick &amp; to the point, making you think you've seen a lot of violence &amp; tons of gore on screen, when you really haven't &amp; that's where the original Chainsaw's power lies, unlike the sequels that just cut to a close up of a gory kill, none of which are nowhere near as scary or suspenseful as this film is! &amp; should serve as a lesson to film-makers like ADAM GREEN &amp; ELI ROTH that you don't need tons of gore to make a truly scary, suspenseful, terrifying horror film! The kills are unique, since the victims are slaughtered like farm animals, with a sledge hammer to the head &amp; a chainsaw cutting up a victim (In a scene that has no gore on screen, which ironically enough, despite the title, is the only kill in the movie done with a chainsaw) &amp; a victim thrown on a hook, with the blood leaking into a metal can that is below the victim. Bodies stored in freezers to prevent the meat from spoiling etc. In fact towards the end, it is even implied that the meat that the kids buy from one of the psycho's, could indeed be the BBQ'd remains of the corpses! add to this &amp; Hooper's horrifying dinner scene at the end, that displays several extreme close ups of people's screaming faces, howls, laughter &amp; terrified eyes, all of which shows them descending into madness, make this an unforgettable horror classic! Don't let the title fool you into thinking this is just another brainless, drive in exploitation feature, Texas Chainsaw Massacre is anything but! The scene where the badly ageing grandfather seemingly gets his energy back, by sucking on the cut finger of the terrified heroine, is rather creepy. Fantastic, eerie score by WAYNE BELL &amp; TOBE HOOPER, really adds to the chills &amp; thrills this movie has to offer. Remade in 2003 (With a prequel being made to the remake) &amp; Followed by four sequels, each of which following after Part 2, asks the viewer to ignore the sequels that came after this film, therefore it makes it really hard to classify the Chainsaw films as a series, rather than just a series of reboots trying to tie themselves to the original. The first sequel being The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 2.**** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low-budget intended shocker film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 7/6/2001 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Tobe Hooper): Low-budget intended shocker film supposedly based on a true story about a case in Texas in the 50's. This movie seems to start out promising as we are introduced to the group of kids who are traveling to their future grisly ending, but when the movie focuses on the disgusting, cannabilistic, perverted family that kills the kids it becomes less and less appealing. This was the pre-cursor to the Friday the 13th, Halloween genre except that the characters that are killed are not quite as stupid or foolish as the victims appear to be in the other films mentioned. I think Hooper was trying to portray a real-life story but seems to get carried away with the ridiculousness of the chainsaw killers and their warped family. It is probably true that without this movie others of this genre would not have followed, but again I'm not sure I'm happy about this because only a couple of those that followed were very good.</fullReview>

This movie was dreadful..The acting was horrible just bad...And leatherface was not scary he was annoying....and I mean annoying...I thought the remake was much better. The actors were far superior to the ones in the classic and it was actually scary opposed to this one which was just annoying.This movie is about a group of friends who are visiting their grandfathers house when they are attacked by a chainsaw wielding maniac and his cannibal family.This movie was just unenjoyable to the core.

		<shortDescription>Gripping, disturbing, grainy looking thriller from the '70s...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tobe Hooper must have gotten on the bandwagon that began when all the slasher films started a trend in the mid-'60s that continues to this day, getting bloodier and gorier with each new film, only done a little more stylishly by someone like Quentin Tarantino.This one seems more like a cheap exploitation film that capitalizes on the idea of a man running berserk with a chainsaw, intent on butchering whomever comes into or near his decrepit old farmhouse. And unfortunately, he's not the only insane creature. It seems there's a family of butchers who thrive on the killing and torturing of their victims.MARILYN BURNS has the biggest role among the teens that stumble upon a haven of killers and she no doubt earned her "Scream Queen" reputation for the way she shrieks violently for the last half-hour or so of the movie. PAUL A. PARTAIN is the wimpy wheelchair friend without a full deck, such an annoying character that his demise comes as somewhat of a relief, although I'm assuming his character was meant to be a nuisance all the way through.Trouble is, none of the characters have likable traits so that caring what happens to them is not a top priority. The accent is strictly on the chills that come from the realistic look of a house full of menace at every turn, a showcase of human bones, skulls, body parts and all that is weird and downright gruesome. In addition, the man with the leather face and chainsaw (GUNNAR HANSEN) is a gruesome enough sight on his own, especially in close-ups.Strictly for those looking for cheap thrills, it doesn't pretend to be anything more than a spine-tingler filmed on a low budget with a cast of relatively unknown players, a grindhouse sort of film that lingers in the memory for all the wrong reasons. Summing up: Be warned, a disturbing film without subtlety or taste--but then, what can you expect from that title? Oddly enough, some call it a cult classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Supposedly this movie cost $70.000 to make but the movie looks like it had been made for $10, tops. Yet the look of the movie is the reason why this is a classic and an horror masterpiece.The actors in this movie are not actors at all, you can tell that by looking at the way they act. It is no wonder that none of their careers ever got of the ground. Also the story is nil, the story is a lame excuse to let a guy with a chainsaw scare some teenagers off. But yet all of it works effective. The movie has a documentary like feeling also thanks to the cinematography and lighting at times (but why oh why is the rail cam used so many times?). All of it gives the movie a chilling and till some extend, realistic horror feeling with some unforgettable classic horror moments and a cool psycho serial killer, in the form of Leatherface.The movie is a bit weird and sloppy at times and unintentional hilarious (especially the ending).

		<fullReview>Once in a while, you get a movie that simply unhinges the brains of normally intelligent people and deprives them of the ability to distinguish between good and bad. TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE is such a movie.Forget all the "seminal this" and "ground-breaking that" stuff you hear about this movie (being the foundation of the slasher genre is nothing which merits praise anyway). The bottom line is that this movie is a piece of crap. It's almost as bad as Hooper's CROCODILE, and probably even worse than his LIFEFORCE. But if you enjoy listening to really, really bad actors alternately scream and whine while a hack director tries to distract from his low budget with feverish attempts at "style," you'll be in hog heaven here.And don't forget the padding: at eighty-three minutes, TCM is at least an hour too long.I suppose for someone interested in the history of genre or "B" flicks, it might be worth watching...once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror porn, technically well made; but so what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no one more self-righteous than a fan of exploitation films. Those who hate and despise these films he piously denounces as prudes. He loftily brandishes his superior ability to have fun and haughtily proclaims his own subtler and finer-tuned sense of humor. You know how in gorefests, like this movie, people get dismembered and murdered? Well, that's irony. And you know how audiences laugh at the people getting dismembered and murdered? That's irony, too. It shows how people will laugh at what frightens them. And they like to be frightened because it helps them cope with the horrors of the real world. And it's good for people to cope with the horrors of the real world because otherwise, instead just watching the kind of acts they see depicted in these films, they might go out and commit these acts themselves. Therefore, censorship encourages murder.It is said that this movie led to "Friday the 13th" or "Halloween" or whatever was the next "milestone" in horror films. And the previous milestone was "The Exorcist." Or was it "Night of the Living Dead"? Or "Psycho"? I say Shakespeare led to this film when he wrote the scene in "King Lear" in which Gloucester's eyes are put out on stage. No one in the Elizabethan era knew there would come a day when people were no longer able to make distinctions or logical arguments. Object to "Chainsaw Massacre," we say, and you must also object to "King Lear." (Never mind "Titus Andronicus" with its parade of horrors, including a "Texas Chainsaw"-like scene where Queen Tamora is tricked into eating meat pies that contain her two sons. This once-loathed play probably now ranks above "Hamlet.") Fans of this movie defend it by claiming that you don't see as much gore as you think you do. It's all artfully suggested by the director, Tobe Hooper, just as Alfred Hitchcock showed us a shower stabbing in "Psycho" without really showing a knife cutting into flesh.So what? First: "Psycho" itself can be reasonably argued to have gone too far, just as "King Lear" can. (See Dr. Johnson.) Second: "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" does not differ from "Psycho" in degree. It differs in kind. "Psycho" is the story of a woman who becomes a thief in a moment of madness; and of the badly disturbed motel proprietor she meets while on the lam. The story includes scenes of violence and horror. This film does not have a story, and it's not about people. It *is* scenes of violence and horror.We meet five youths who are traveling in a van through a rural town: two young women; three young men, one of whom is in a wheelchair. The man in the wheelchair is quirky but not interesting; the other four are colorless. The actor playing the invalid overacts; the actors playing the other four underact. The film contains one moment of humanity when one girl asks the other if she thinks there is anything to horoscopes. She answers, "Everything means something."Not in this movie. The first twenty minutes are a build-up to the five youths getting stalked and murdered. The rest of it is them getting stalked and murdered. (Very similar, I've heard, to recent movies like "Wolf Creek.") The main murderer is a retardate who wears a leather mask and squeals like a pig; the others are the members of his ghoulish hillbilly family, who like to dig up graves and make barbecue out of human flesh. We're plunged into a meaningless hell, and the only relief is the bad acting and the cartoonish implausibility of the killers.Sure, it's scary. Sure, Hooper is skillful at scaring us. But whatever Quentin Tarantino and other aesthetes of excrement might say, this isn't a real movie. At some point in the 1970s, the horror genre spawned a branch of pornography, and this is one of its rotten fruit. The distinction between horror movie and horror-porn can be blurry and somewhat arbitrary. But that's no excuse for not making it. "Psycho" has a shocking shower scene; "Massacre" is all shower scene. It has the same meaning and claim to art as would 83 minutes of watching Janet Leigh getting stabbed in slow motion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw massacre (1974) - I like the feel of the movie; it seems like documentary, the radio commentary (news) going on, the music give the movie a great start. But the movie overall is not at all thrilling let alone scary. The murder happens so quickly? The only thrill (to an extent) one can get is in last 20-30 minutes with only one single person actually giving fight.. Maybe they wanted the leather head to be unconquerable but when he can do it with so much ease it doesn't give the movie enough thrilling moments .The story is nothing. I know most horror doesn't have any story but they have those chilling moments and thrill to keep one hooked it fails on that account for most part of the movie.. Acting wise though over the top I like the actor who played hitchhiker ? he appeared complete maniac, insane .. Other characters were neither developed nor did anything to actually speak of. The leather face's first appearance was good and intriguing but overall disappointed with his character as well . here I would like to appreciate the art director he has done credible job though there are some inconsistencies . The scene where the girl is tied up - screaming and her face(eye ball close up as well) close up was being shot again n again to show the terror and scare but it was irritating as it was repeated for a minute or so . Overall It's a below average movie . I would rate the movie 4.5/10</fullReview>

Franklin the cripple could have taken him in a knife fight. Worst element of all was the 40 minute chase between the hit chick and leatherface. The end of that chase was stupider than the whole movie itself.

		<shortDescription>Does Not Live Up To Its Reputation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Texas chainsaw massacre(1974) does not live up to its reputation as being a horror classic. i was disappointed in the cinematography, acting, directing, and the handling of the plot line. a group of Texas kids are on their way to check out the grave site of a deceased relative and after head to an out of town rock concert. the kids come across a hitchhiker while heading to the concert and decide to pick him up. the young man has blood on his hands/shirt and is mumbling the same thing over and over. the kids decide to help him out by taking a dirt road back to where the young man came from. the young man gets nervous and either runs off or kills himself i can't recall exactly. this plot advancement doesn't do much to pull the storyline along. the kids end up at a run down house where a creepy disabled man lives with his family. a couple of the kids have already been killed at this point and the viewer is supposed to be scared. scared of "what is out there" and of the creepy old man. the old guy does not have a telephone but tells the kids where to find a phone booth. the main male character heads off to the telephone booth while the others explore the house and its barn. I'm probably missing a few plot points but you get the basic premise. all the kids get killed, except for a pretty young girl, by leather face. leather face's mask is a joke as are the ones his family members are wearing. all leather face does in this film is wave a chainsaw around wildly while the camera cuts away just when the slashing begins. the lone surviving girl spends the last 20 minutes of the film screaming her fool head off over and over again. i wanted leather face to kill her. i'd rather have heard that obnoxious chainsaw then listen to anymore screaming. my friend and i eventually muted the TV we lost our patience. however, the stupid girl gets away and though the TV was muted we could tell she was still screaming. she flags down a trucker while standing along the side of the highway. we thought she would've shut up by then but that was not the case. this film is a piece of trash that does not deserve its cult status. the 2003 remake of this film is superior to the original. the acting, cinematography, directing, adding more detail to the plot line, and the intensity level are excellent! its a very well crafted horror film remake that keeps you on the edge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After decades of hearing about this film, I thought I would make my own judgement and see it for myself.I don't know what's worse. The fact that people want to make films like this, or that people get some entertainment value from watching them. Violence, if portrayed properly with artistic skill, has value in conveying a worthwhile message. It has to have context and meaning in relation to character and situation to have any sense to it.Films like this portray violence (even if implied) for violences' sake. Completely pointless. Hey guess what? 'People are cruel to each other'. That's no surprise is it? What motivates and drives violence is more interesting and worth exploring.Badly executed (pardon the pun), poorly conceived in relation to what actually happened, this film is worth missing, even if you are curious.I find it deeply troubling that anybody watching this film, and others like it, can derive any kind of pleasure from doing so. Perhaps what's worse is that they delude themselves into thinking that because it was banned that it then deserves the banner of 'classic'. Or that by virtue of it being reported as 'shocking' it has some kind of artistic value.This film only works on one level. It is that if proof where needed that the there are certain individuals that get their 'jollies' from watching rubbish like this, then films like this will continue to be made. And they are! What does that say about society? How very depressing?</fullReview>

I know it was the first of its kind, and I think that's the only reason it is remembered.And on another note, this "true story" it was based on was the life of Ed Gein. In short: it involved no chainsaws, no teenagers, and didn't even happen in Texas. Gein shot two women and dug up bodies, doing canniblism and wore people's flesh.

		<fullReview>Ok, I saw the remake before I ever saw the original, and I've always thought remakes just tarnish the identity of the original but when I saw the remake and loved it, I expected the original to be a cinematic masterpiece. Well, I couldn't be further from the truth. The opening was just about the only interesting part. Right off the bat, you hate the characters. Most of them are snobby, the guy in the wheelchair is annoying and they're just not nice people. So right there, when they start dying, you don't really care, at all. The hitchiker part had no signifigance whatsoever besides just implying everyone in that county was messed up. There was an extreme lack of gore, which isn't a bad thing because I've found being overly gory can make a movie look silly. The remake had pretty graphic violence in it, but in my opinion kept it classy enough so you didn't think it was there just for eye candy, but rather to make it more brutal and real so you could feel how they feel. Everyone says the original relies on "pure scares and disturbing moments" rather than blood. Well, it got disturbing at times, but the pure scares? Yes the girl popping out of the freezer made me lose sleep for days, um I laughed at that part. It's clear to me the only reason there isn't tons of gore is because they didn't have enough money to have gore that would look real and not ridiculous. Because if I remember correct, Tobe Hooper came back to make the sequel which was over the top gory, over the top in every way. There was nothing scary about this, it was all cheap thrills and I turned it off after about two people got killed, and I don't even remember who got killed, because I never cared when someone died. Bad characters, bad direction, bad movie altogether.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE (Tobe Hooper, 1974) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally managed to watch this after never having had the opportunity to do so on either TV or PAL VHS. Unfortunately, the DVD I rented from a local shop was the R4 bare-bones edition!Amongst other things, I had read that the film was nowhere nearly as gory as it was made up to be and, now that I've seen it for myself, I certainly agree (the first half, especially, is pretty harmless). Actually, what the film has going for it is a relentless tension and a genuine creepiness, particularly during its latter stages (when it really comes into its own as a compelling and heart-pounding horror piece).I realize that all of this may not be anything new to anyone here who has already watched THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE scores of times. Still, to me, while I concede that the film is reasonably well made (particularly some effective quick cutting to accentuate the moments of shock), I would not rank it among my favorites from the genre &#x2013; it may be a modern 'classic' but it's NOT in the same league as some of the older milestones I love so much (or even contemporaries like THE WICKER MAN [1973], for that matter)!The film's young cast &#x2013; a staple of the slasher subgenre, and a regrettable one &#x2013; is, all things considered, not as bad (and useless) as that of later entries. Marilyn Burns in particular acquits herself quite well in a difficult role (where she is driven to such a frenzy by her close encounters with the backwoods family of cannibals that she twice escapes with her life by hurling herself through the window-panes of the house! Ouch!). As for the villains themselves: Leatherface, while under-developed, is certainly a memorable creation (aided a great deal by his unconventional 'costume') but his two brothers I found to be particularly obnoxious and, for me, brought the film down a notch or two. That said, the lecherous wheelchair-bound old man's decrepit make-up &#x2013; not forgetting the house itself (a veritable character in its own right), with its generally 'sick' décor &#x2013; do get under one's skin after a while!The various murders and mutilations are depicted in a quite vicious manner &#x2013; particularly for its time &#x2013; but these do not, in the end, come off as exploitative (as with most other slashers) because the film, perhaps mercifully, certainly does not linger on the blood and other nasty detail in order to heighten the sensation of the moment. The film's conclusion, then, is satisfactorily harrowing &#x2013; and a memorable one, in my opinion.I've only seen two other films by Tobe Hooper &#x2013; the original TV version of SALEM'S LOT (1979) and POLTERGEIST (1982) &#x2013; but, compared to this, they both seem fairly impersonal if still expertly done (no doubt a result of the over-riding 'influence' of author Stephen King and producer Steven Spielberg, respectively).In the end, this film &#x2013; the original, the one and only 'Texas Chain Saw Massacre' &#x2013; has not whetted my appetite enough for similar things, certainly not so much that I would want to seek out its (reportedly vastly inferior) sequels&#x2026;and, least of all, the upcoming remake which promises to be simply god-awful (produced by Michael Bay? What a riot)! That said, I would still love to pick up the R2 SE (from Universal) which, apart from the supplements featured on Pioneer's R1 DVD, also includes the feature-length documentary 'The Shocking Truth' (which has to be purchased individually outside of this region!).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is quite possibly the worst horror flick of all time. Why? Because horror's key element: music, is missing. If you want to watch Hollywood horror at its best, then watch the 2 definitive films: Psycho and The Exorcist. I give it 0.5 stars only because it's better than Gigli.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of pulpy, low-budget horror, I probably should've seen this sooner, but I didn't, and frankly I wish I hadn't. This movie is dreadful in virtually every way. For starters, the premise is completely implausible - you'd think that with the implied number of victims the 'Sawyer' family had killed over the years, even backwoods Texas authorities would've taken notice and closed in on them at some point. The acting and scripting... sucks. None of the players were professionals, and it shows. The teenage victims are insufferably dull and trite, and their dialogue was irritating at best (particularly the strangely unsympathetic Franklin). The family's hamminess and lack of subtlety makes them far less than believable as villains. Even the infamous Leatherface is rendered more comic than menacing by his jerky motions (particularly during the final scene) and apparent mindlessness. The element of surprise is the only thing this movie has going for it in terms of inciting real terror, and even that is dulled by the hamfisted use of foreshadowing, and tedious pacing. As for the supposed 'graphic violence'... where is it, exactly? The only visible bloodspray in this film is caused by characters being cut on their hands or forearms. What the hell good is a gore movie with no gore? If you want real effective low-budget horror, you're much better off watching the original Night of the Living Dead, Cannibal Holocaust or Zombi 2. Those films will horrify in a convincing manner. Hell, even mainstream films like The Thing, Alien and Jaws (or the newer and much maligned Hostel) offer exponentially more scares than this piece of crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>what r u all talking about??? this movie sucked. the minute i pressed the play button i started waiting for the movie to finish! it wasn't scary at all!! there has to be suspense so there's enough time for fear. i mean the girl was walking and suddenly shes dead, there was no suspense music. and after scene 10 the setting was completely dark, u cant even see whats going on. literally!!. i no its a small budget movie but the director still could've put better music. the 'music' didn't even make any sense. the dinner party scene was good at first but then when they put a very close close-up of Sally's eyes. it just looks disgusting and makes the audience uncomfortable. i haven't seen the new version but I've read that its worse, i cant even imagine how bad it could get.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The epitome of horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In technical terms, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a bad film. The acting and the script are terrible, and the production values are extremely low. Not only that, but the film lacks any real plot and the characters are so badly done that we can't care for them at all. So then, why is this film one of the most important and influential that cinema has to offer? Why does it have legions of fans, why has it become one of the most imitated films in cinema history? Because it's absolute pure, balls to the wall, uncompromising, unflinching horror - that's why! In fact, it may even be the 'purest' horror film ever made. There is nothing here but horror, and that gets a big thumbs up from me. And every other horror fan, I'm sure. The film, loosely based on the American serial killer, Ed Gein, features very little in the way of gore, but masses and masses in the way of suspense. At times, like the part of the film that sees Leatherface chase our heroine, chainsaw in hand through the woodlands of the area that surrounds the killer's house, the suspense is so tense that it's hard to watch. The sequence itself actually doesn't last long, but because it's so nail-biting, it feels like it lasts for hours. The films plays like this for the majority of it's running time; it doesn't show the chainsaw tearing flesh, but it does show you the build up, and, at times, brief imagery depicting what is happening; and that's all we need. The film is very brutal and it is not an experience that you will easily forget; the scene that sees the almost deceased grandfather suck on a young girls finger is an image that I personally will never forget. The majority of the characters in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre aren't worth mentioning, with two exceptions; Franklin and, of course, Leatherface. Franklin is, probably, one of the most annoying characters ever created in cinema. So annoying, in fact, that you'll be over the moon when he gets it. In stark contrast to Franklin, Leatherface is the absolute star of the show. Like the film itself, Leatherface is brutal. From the ungraceful way that he moves, down to the cold and animalistic way that he behaves, Leatherface is the epitome of terror. When coupled with the movie's weapon of choice, and my personal favourite - the chainsaw, it takes the character into a whole different dimension. The chainsaw is a piece of kit that takes on a life of it's own when it's engine is revved. It screams terror, and Tobe Hooper obviously knew this from the callous way that the weapon is brought to life in this film. There isn't much else to say about this film that hasn't been said a million times before, so I guess all there is left is - watch it! The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a film of such majestic importance that it should be made a crime for any fan of cinema not to watch it. Highest recommendations from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Funny Than Scary...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I particularly like one scene in "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," in which a bewildered teenaged girl flees for her life, running from a madman yielding a chainsaw, known to the audience in later years as the infamous "Leatherface." The girl screams at the top of her lungs, trying to escape the grasp of ol' Leatherface, who is only a few feet behind her. Suddenly, however, in a wide shot, he is twenty feet behind her. Then in another, he is two feet behind her.This is just one of the many plot/shot inconsistencies on an infinite list for "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre." Another particularly delightful mistake is in which a paralyzed-with-fear truck driver flees for his life from Leatherface, only to disappear in later shots. We assume the man has continued running down the highway he and his truck were upon, but we must ask ourselves as the credits draw to an end, why didn't he just drive away in his truck?Of course, this is what makes "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" so fun and charming. It is an odd little film, but it is more humorous than anything. I suppose the beginning, in which a band of teenagers travel into Texas and come upon a slaughterhouse occupied by the infamous Leatherface, is supposed to be scary. The teenagers, entering the spooky house, disappear one-by-one. Their untimely death is, apparently, supposed to send chills up the audience's spine. But it doesn't. It more or less amuses the audience.The teenagers in this film exceed the stupidity of teenagers from other horror flicks. Take, for example, the scene where the teenagers all disappear inside the slaughterhouse. The first teen goes in, and doesn't return. So instead of teaming up and going to look for the missing teenager, the dumb individuals (if you can even call them that) decide to go in one-by-one and search for what becomes missing others. No luck! They keep on dying, one-by-one, and we just know the guy in the wheelchair is going to get it.How this film became a horror hit is beyond me. Perhaps a comedy, but a horror? The film seems like it was made by amateur filmmakers on a personal camcorder, and it wouldn't surprise me if director/producer Tobe Hooper did, in fact, film it on a camcorder. It makes the shakiness of "The Blair Witch Project" look like "Citizen Kane."Tobe Hooper has a taste for odd, disturbing films, it seems. Just look at the "dinner scene" in "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," and the characters and the filming techniques (i.e. zooming in on the eye until it makes the viewer sick). I guess to really call this a classic horror film you have to be a fan of sick films, disgusting films, and fantasy films. Yes, fantasy films. The situations are fantasy-material in and of themselves. Fantasies are usually about a different world, and the laws of the earth do not apply. Well, the same is for "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."In the end, "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is an amusing film, but a bit too disgusting at times to be called great, and a bit too humorous at times to be called horror.On a scale of "real film," to be judged against movies like "Citizen Kane," "Casablanca," etc., this would get a "1." But on a level of fun, it's pretty entertaining.3/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The remake is infinitely better...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high expectations about the original TCM since I recently saw the remake and liked it. I was thoroughly disappointed. Too much screaming and yelling of "Jerry!!" and "Sally!!" and not enough story or character development, and to be honest, not enough blood or gore for a scary movie, which could have been forgiven if it had good dialogue and acting, but that was non-existent. Near the end of the movie I was just wishing that the character played by Marilyn Burns would hurry up and die so that I wouldn't have to hear her annoying screams anymore. I also thought that it lacked in atmosphere, which is essential to any horror flick, at least IMHO.Definitely on the bottom of my list of horror movies that I would recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies I have seen in my entire life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Too bad there's no 0 out of 10 rating or this movie would easily get that. The only reason you should ever watch this movie is if you are planning on shooting your own horror picture and want a good idea of what NOT to do. Here's a list of reasons why this movie is so bad: 1) The first half of the movie. Nothing happens in the first half. Basically it's a bunch of idiots in their van talking about random stuff without a point. There was so much potential for character development and make the viewer actually care about the characters, but no. This renders the first half of the movie a complete waste of film.2) The second half of the movie! (surprise surprise) FINALLY the first half is over and maybe some interesting stuff will happen. Right? WRONG! The beginning of the second half consists of what I like to call "negative character development" (meaning the characters keep complaining and acting like jerks so I actually DISLIKE them even more than before). Afterwards when somebody goes missing, these idiots go one at a time to investigate (which is actually a good thing because seeing as I actually wanted the characters to die, it would increase the chances that my wish would be granted). And then when leatherface is chasing the last remaining character around, that is laughable because in one shot he is close and in the next he is far away and the next he is close again. The last remaining character acts really dumb as well. And then the ending (i.e. the stuff that happens after the night ends) is a complete joke. As a result, the film becomes funny in a pathetic sort of way rather than scary.3) The cinematography wasn't done well (i.e. I know nothing about film but I could've done a better job shooting the movie).4) There was no explanation for anything. This in combined with the ridiculous appearance and actions of the whole cannibal family makes it all the more silly (the grandfather character was especially silly and should not have even been in the script - he looked like some kid dressed up in some goofy halloween outfit that's not creepy at all).5) The acting, for the most part, was terrible.6) Too clichéd. (i.e. the main character running from the bad guy, tripping, falling, getting back up, and running more).Final verdict: 0/10. Everything about this movie is all either laughable (in a mocking sort of way) or just plain stupid, and not scary at all. The only good thing about this movie is that many of the characters (who you grow to hate during the movie) die. So unless you feel like wasting your money buying/renting this, never see it. You'll just find yourself checking your watch every 2-3 minutes. If you're looking for a scary classic movie, go see Halloween.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even watching this movie at 2x speed was excruciatingly... boring.Slow-paced, uninteresting, a zero on the scare/shock factor.What's to like about a live-action Scooby Doo gang meets a chainsaw-wielding freak? This is even worse than 2004's Dawn of the Dead, which I'll give it credit, actually made me laugh a few times. Not so in The Chainsaw Massacre. I love horror. This movie is not horror. It's a forty-five minute inane road-trip documentary, followed by another forty-five minutes of "are we done yet" schlock. Even watching it for free, I'd be asking for a refund of the time I just wasted. Definitely not a horror flick for the current generation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre starts with some rolling text that is there for no good purpose as far as I can see &amp; it informs us that The Texas Chain Saw Massacre takes place on 'August 18, 1973' where a group of five friends are on a fun road trip of some sort, but it's never really made clear what their doing exactly. Because of a recent spate of grave desecration's in the area Sally (Marilyn Burns) &amp; her Brother the wheelchair bound Franklin Hardesty (Paul A. Partain) decide to check their Grandfather's grave on the way &amp; stop off at his old derelict run-down house. After a scary incident with a psychotic hitchhiker (Edwin Neal) they arrive at the house where Sally's memories come flooding back, Kirk (William Vail) &amp; his girlfriend Pam (Teri McMinn) decide to head to a nearby creek for a swim but notice a house in the distance which they head for in search of gas for their van. Jerry (Allen Danziger) also disappears towards the creek leaving just Sally &amp; Frankin behind, hours later it becomes dark &amp; when none of their friends have returned Sally &amp; Franklin feel they must go &amp; look for them, instead they find terror &amp; death as they are attacked by the chainsaw wielding maniac Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen)...Co-written, co-produced &amp; directed by Tobe Hooper The Texas Chain Saw Massacre seems to be regarded by many as the best horror film ever made, while it's undoubtedly a good film &amp; succeeds at what it sets out to do I personally don't find it a particularly entertaining or watchable film, in fact I'm probably one of the few people who much prefers Hooper's sequel The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986). The script by Hooper &amp; Kim Henkel is a little slow &amp; frankly dull, I found the character of Franklin very annoying &amp; everyone else were just plain bland &amp; uninteresting. This could be down to Hooper &amp; Henkel's attempts to create realistic, gritty &amp; factual down to Earth characters but I tend to think it's just bad writing. No real explanation is given for anything &amp; the film plods along like any other slasher, yes I know this was probably the first of it's kind but that doesn't automatically make it the best. The film is played totally straight &amp; first time director Hooper manages to create some genuinely creepy, unsettling &amp; horrific moments like the way Leatherface is introduced when he kills Kirk, a brutal, short, bleak &amp; minimalist scene which is highly effective. As are some of the interior shots of the Sawyer house with the furniture made of human &amp; animal bones, the grimy dirty bizarre ornament strewn realistic house actually feels like it might belong to the Sawyer family if they had existed rather than feeling like a Hollywood production designers imagination gone wild. The opening sequence is also a stand out moment as Hooper presents a scene in which a rotten corpse is shown through quick flashes &amp; close-up camera shots. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre ends rather suddenly &amp; I hated all that annoying screaming constantly coming from Sally for the last 15 or so minutes, at one point I literary pressed mute on my remote control because it was getting on my nerves so much, I'm surprised my family didn't call the police with all the ear piercing screaming coming from my bedroom! Despite it's exploitative title forget about any chainsaw massacres as only one person is actually killed with a chainsaw &amp; there is virtually no blood or gore whatsoever even though there's a decent looking decomposing corpse at the start. Technically The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is pretty good throughout considering the supposed $140,000 budget although it is a little cheap looking at times. The cinematography by Daniel Pearl in particular is impressive with some cool angles, some nice smooth camera movements &amp; some excellent use of light, sunset, dark &amp; camera glare from the sun. The film prefers to rely on background noise &amp; sound effects rather than music which works well. The acting is quite good as well apart from the annoying Partain as Franklin. The DVD I own features various deleted &amp; alternate scenes which would add nothing to be honest if they were put back in. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a regarded as a classic &amp; horror fans should watch it as soon as possible but don't go into it expecting the best film ever which is probably the reason why I was ultimately disappointed with it. Despite all that it does well I just didn't like it as a film that much, I found it a bit boring, certain things annoyed me &amp; got on my nerves &amp; I had the feeling all the way through that I'd seen it all before as I had only watched it for the first time as recently as 2000, after years of hearing how fantastic it was the word over-hyped sprung to mind as the closing credits began to roll. Worth a watch but isn't anything that I would call brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THIS is a classic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I want to make one thing clear...I'm a huge horror movie fan. I love them--old ones, new ones, gory, non-gory...everything. But I really HATE this film!POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!Five 20-somethings (all of them annoying) are out on a road in rural Texas. They're running low on gas so two of them go to an isolated farmhouse to get some. In no time at all, one is hit in the head with a sledgehammer and the other is hung up on a meat hook. The others come looking and one by one are killed until one is left (Sally well-acted by Marilyn Burns). Can she get away?Hopeless. This film is a mess. The first 45 minutes are very very dull. We listen to these five uninteresting characters yap endlessly about nothing. No insight to their characters or their motivations. One in particular (Franklyn) is VERY annoying--I couldn't wait for him to get it. When they start getting killed, you could care less. They never come across as real people so how can you get upset about their being killed? And the killings aren't ever remotely gory. You hear them,but don't see them. And the constant chainsaw on the soundtrack gave me a headache.Also the acting mostly sucks. The family all overacts (although some of the sounds Leatherface gave did spook me)...Burns gave out the only good performance. Unfortunately she's TOO good. When she's being tortured and abused by the family at the end hearing her screaming and seeing her crying is way too realistic.No gore, no plot, no characters, no point and--most important of all--no scares. A worthless piece of garbage. As one of the previous posters mentioned, the only people who seem to like it are those who saw it in 1974 (when it was really shocking). Most younger people (in their 20s) who I've spoken to who have seen it, don't like it. Not worth anybody's time.</fullReview>
