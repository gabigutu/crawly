		<shortDescription>Way Better than I Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original is a classic, I guess that's why there's a copy of it at the Museum of Modern Art in NYC.Taken as a remake, this is a good film. The story was different enough to keep me guessing, the characters were, uhhh, fleshed out a little more. While the original at times seemed like a documentary, this one was a straight-up horror movie, though without too many of the cliches that make modern horror movies tedious.On it's own, this was a very good horror movie. Well-filmed, well-acted, suspensful, with good characters. The kids in this movie are not all just obnoxious kids--they get into trouble because of a good deed, so I found myself rooting for them, even the annoying one or two. The casting of Lee Ermey as the sheriff is icing on the cake; he definitely brought the movie up a few notches.While not a classic, this remake is worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Although Unnecessary, a Good Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On August 18th, 1973, in Texas, the youths Erin (Jessica Biel), her boy-friend Kemper (Eric Balfour), their friends Andy (Mike Vogel) and Morgan (Jonathan Tucker) and the hitchhiker Pepper (Erica Leerhsen) are returning from a vacation in Mexico to a concert of the Lynnard Skynnard. Kemper is driving his van, when they see a disturbed young woman dangerously wandering on the road. They decide to help her, and the woman commits suicide inside the vehicle. They decide to look for a telephone to call the Sheriff, and they end in the house of Thomas Hewitt (Andrew Bryniarski), where their lives are threatened by the sick Leatherface and his deranged family.I was quite reluctant to see this remake. The original "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is a classic, and as I have already written in other reviews, I do not see any reason to release remakes of movies, mainly classics. However, and although unnecessary, this remake is very good. The cast, leaded by the delicious Jessica Biel, have good and convincing performances. The cinematography is great, being very nasty in the property of Leatherface. In the end, I liked this version and I even dare to recommend it. I believe the fans, like me, of the original "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" will not be disappointed. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "O Massacre da Serra Elétrica" ("The Chainsaw Massacre")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2003 Remake of classic, not as bad as you think!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horrors have a bad reputation for poor sequels and bad remakes, which is why when people heard there was a remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the general thought was that they would be butchering the classic(excuse the pun). However this is a terrifying, shocking, emotional thrill of a movie. It may not be up to the standards of the 1970s version, but to be fair, nothing is. The acting is quite well done. The film takes advantage of the time its being made in and the budget, with this version having much better production values, its much more gory but not at the cost of story telling.The realism is superb and the movie is, at times, as sad as it is scary due to the emotional torture of the characters, i'm sure many people will say its not as good as the original but it could have been a lot worse</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First take away the originality....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TCM is an adequate horror film in its own right but will play better if you have not seen the original. The makers of the 2003 remake have stripped the original of its dusty, dirty intensity and its blacker than black humour and replaced them with a few Hollywood conventions so as not to challenge the audience too much. The problem is that 30 years later the remake is just so much more conventional than the visceral original. The directors do copy some of the original shots but see fit not to try to copy the nasty humour that made the original stand up to repeated viewings. Remember the scene in the original where Sally wakes up, tied to a chair, surrounded by the nightmare freakshow of a family and screams her very soul out whilst the camera zooms into extreme close up of her tear filled eyes as her tormentors laugh and taunt her? One of the great moments of 70's shock cinema. Well, here, its a lukewarm rehash where she comes to on the floor with all the horror of waking up with a bit of a hangover. Other pointless changes include trying to normalise some of the originals quirkier moments; originally they wanted to find out if their granparents bodies had been dug up by graverobbers; in the remake, they are on their way to see Lynyrd Skynard. And what happened to wheelchair bound Franklin? Here the nearest thing to a disability is that one of the characters wears glasses. And whats the deal with water? The house in the remake should have floated away the amount of leaky pipes it has. OK its not a BAD film despite using all the old tricks but it seems to me that if you want to see a great film you may as well watch the original and see some really good film-making</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Is One Hell Of A Horror Film!!! I have to say too that the acting was very good, though I wonder how hard it is to fake fear when you see some of the scenarios the actors were in, but even the background actors (especially the actor portraying Leatherface and the wonderful R. Lee Ermey as the sheriff) are very good and add an element of paranoid fear to the film. The thing that shocked me most was how brutal and graphic the film was, the gore being very realistic, and used very well. Instead of buckets of blood, we get moments of horror that end in a very bright splash of red. And like the first, the most brutal killings are shot in a way so that you see what is happening to the victim but yet DON'T see it at the same time. This is not a perfect film. It is too decadently dark and a lot of people will hate the film for that reason, and it will be hard to see this as being a movie you will want to watch over and over and over again. But in saying that, I admit that that is why the film succeeds so well ? they nailed the mood perfectly. They didn't grave-rob it from the original but created their own. As a horror fan I cannot recommend this film enough. It stands just behind 28 Days Later as the second best horror film in a year that has turned out pretty darned well for the genre. Yes, it is a remake, and yes, the original is better, but having said that, I also must tell you that this is a very well crafted horror film and a wonderful spook show ride. I dunno if I am happy that it is going to do well at the box office or not (it won the box office battle its opening weekend) because I don't know what that means for all the other propose remakes. But if nothing else, at least they didn't screw this one up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>was expecting worse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not bad for a re-make of course it didn't have quite the impact of the original. It did a decent job building tension and there was a darker atmosphere to the location, made it seem more nightmarish. Obviously the film had some advantages from a bigger budget, and R. Lee Ermey is definitely worth watching. As for the family, you had an almost twisted take on 'the dirty south', or in this case southwest, people being more bizarre caricatures, but with the darker and more atmospheric setting it works. Interstingly, it seems to lack the social commentary of the original, but that is very common with remakes these days. Though there is extensive use of rather effective foreshadowing in numerous scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delivers What it Intends To</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is meant to be brutal, dirty, disgusting, awe inspiring, and terrifying. It succeeds on being each and evry one. The movie, once it "picks up" is unrelenting, suspensful, and leaves you with an uneasy feeling. There is such a stong sense of hopelesness throughout the second half, such negative emotions are elicited without so much as a second of comic relief. Yes, there is some comedy, but its all in the first third or so of the movie. The movie drags for a bit at the beginning, but once it all begins, its some scary s**t. I am an avid horror movie fan, I watch everything that comes out. Nothing has really scraed me, at least not in years. This movie scared the crap out of me. I actually wanted to turn away at one point. I wanted to run, I had second thoughts, kind of like being on a rollercoaster for the first time. I left the theater with an uneasy feeling. I couldn't stop laughing nervously, I guess I was trying to cope with what I had seen. My girlfriend was absolutely terrified. Two girls behind us were literally crying becuase they were so terrified. All around us people were screaming, jumping, squirming. After the movie, everyone was saying "that was the scariest movie I have ever seen" and "that was nuts." I couldn't agree more. This movie really, actually, truly scared me. It was just so brutal. I felt terrified for the victims; I felt afraid of the villian (Leatherface was awesome). I loved this movie. It obvioulsy has flaws. The beginning was slow, there were like thirty "jump scares," people walked around exploring stuff alone, etc etc. But this movie, if judged based on how much it did what it intended to do, gets a 10 out of 10. Easy. I thought this remake was going to be easy to stomach, I figured it was going to be "hollywoodized." I was dead wrong. This movie was insane, period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The horror/sci-fi movie critic Richard Scheib coined the term "Backwoods Brutality" to describe the slew of low-budget movies that emerged in the 1970s which had as their main theme the violent and abrupt destruction of middle-class serenity. The concept has occasionally found expression outside of the horror genre (Straw Dogs, Deliverance), but since Wes Craven's Last House on the Left (1972), it has been a mainstay of the horror genre. Even thirty years later, the basic idea continues to be remade and re-interpreted. In my view, the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) is the most successful exponent of the genre. As it often is in the American variations of this genre, the TCM takes the so-called blue state/red state dichotomy to a grotesque extreme: the backroads of the Deep South is another country and its inhabitants exhibit uncontained contempt for every unsuspecting wayfarer. Its use of tension, which is meticulously established in the movie's first 45 minutes, and release -- the last 45 minutes -- is almost elegant in its simplicity. Throughout, violence is used in sparing and sudden bursts until the adrenaline-fueled final act, during which it is mercilessly sustained.With some minor qualifications, this description also fits Marcus Nispel's 2003 remake. Here the enlarged budget and technical expertise have worked both for and against the film. On the one hand, a variety of new elements have been added to the story. Some, like the mysterious little boy or the ending, are so-so, while others, like Leatherface's skin mask or the "extended family," are effective. On the other hand, the professionalism and attention to detail demonstrated by Nispel and Daniel Pearl (whose cinematography here is magnificent) on down to those responsible for filming locations and set detail, is consistently impressive.So the basic "tension-release" framework has been lifted from the original but instead of improving on it the filmmakers have saddled it with characters, situations, drama, and violence. (We learn from the DVD extras, happily, that some "tender moments" were left on the cutting room floor.) I give it a 7 because ultimately I think it works as a horror movie on its own terms -- in fact, I don't think a better American horror movie has been made since 2000 -- and Nispel/Kosar deserve credit attempting to revise the concept in minor ways for fans of the franchise. On the balance, however, the original's low-budget guerilla-like realism as well as some of its visceral power has been compromised.Of note, finally, is the performance of Jessica Biel. Having earned her acting chops on the Christian TV show/cheesefest, Seventh Heaven, Biel has as of late found a niche playing physically tough, but likable and intelligent characters. She's quite excellent here; as it was for the original TCM's Marilyn Burns, Biel's performance is exhilarating and intense -- a kind of endurance test. But one easily believes she has the acuity and toughness to survive the ordeal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Well Done Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the remake of the 1974 film The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I thought this remake was done very well, it was very scary and very brutal. Much better then many recent attempts at horror. Im not saying that this is better then the original or worse, because in my opinion the two films were made very differently. This isnt the exact same movie, there are different characters, and many scenes are different. There are lots of similarities and references. The movie had one of the darkest atmospheres ive ever encountered in a film and was extremely brutal and gorey. A must see for a fan or the original and its sequels and horror films. If you like this definitely check out Wrong Turn, another recent horror film that i was impressed with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where was the cannibalism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS (not many)Good news: The 2003 remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has a chainsaw massacre, and yes, it is in Texas.Bad news: It's boring.Gore belongs in horror movies! But excessive gore? That is harder to pull off. Comically camp horrors such as, say, Braindead, The Evil Dead series, and the three TCM sequels get away with gore because theirs is so excessive as to be absurd. But for a serious horror, gore has to serve its story, not the other way round. Used excessively, played too fast and too loose, gore is exhibitionist, immature, and downright boring.The story of TCM the Original (1974) is simple and straightforward: some dumb kids pick up a loony hitchhiker, visit his loony home, meet his loony family, and wind up at their loony dinner table--some of them as dinner. The violence of the story is mostly implied, occurring off-screen. There is no gore. Had there been gore, TCMtO would have been little more than a snuff film, its audience a passive witness. But horror thrives on an active, not a passive, imagination. By tickling our worst imaginations, the lack of gore only reinforces the horror of the film.The problem with TCM the Remake is not that it is gory (and it is--far moreso than the original, if not the sequels), but that its gore does not serve the story, instead only underscoring its weaknesses, namely a meandering, cruelly confusing plot with characters and scenes that are at once too many and too similar. While the original is admittedly episodic, the remake is all over the place, rushing from scene to repetitive scene, bouncing from character to competing character.Just try to digest this indigestible plot: A group of kids are rude to each other on a road trip; then they are rude to a girl they pick up from the side of the road. Moseying on over to a derelict barbecue joint, they are rude to a little old lady. Then it's off to a derelict mill/junkyard/installation art gallery-cum-sculpture garden to be rude to the banjo kid from Deliverance! They split up, rudely, and one group ends up at the derelict Family House (which, with its plantation architecture, is creepier than the original's), where they are rude to a little old man. After several more scene hops and some judicious dispatching of the cast courtesy our old pal Leatherface (who at 260-odd pounds should cut down on his red meats; I don't know how he keeps up with those kids), a lone survivor escapes into the woods to a derelict trailer, is restored to the derelict Family House, escapes again to a derelict shack, hides in a derelict (or at any rate USDA unapproved) slaughterhouse, and finally ends up back at the derelict barbecue joint. All this, while the white trash Family (here inexplicably surnamed Hewitt) behave very rudely to her indeed.Meanwhile there are subplots afoot!--baby snatching, incest, genetic disease, police conspiracy. The only thing that's missing is the Illuminati. Oh, yeah, and the cannibalism. YES: IN THIS REMAKE OF TCM, THERE IS NO CANNIBALISM. (It's still implied, what with the meat hooks and the slaughterhouse (a nice touch, that, but unfortunately it just meshes together with the other innumerable hide-and-go-seek scenes), but without the original's critical barbecue pit and dinner table scenes the nastiest bit of the horror is lost.)Confused yet? Bored, even?I sure was. For as many changes of scenery as TCMtR has, all of them look the same. I understand how that might be intentional--that's part of the horror, right? that there's no escape?--but how many near-identical shots of Jessica Biel running and hiding and shivering and sucking in her breath in terror are necessary to tell the story?Some of the plot is left unsatisfactorily unexplained, and even more is just plum illogical. For instance, immediately before pulling a gun from--of all places--her bloodied crotch and blowing her brains out in the van, the girl-from-the-roadside tells the kids they're all gonna die. This is what a plucky survivor does when she at long last has a shot to escape her tormentors? Okay, then why not do it earlier, or why not stop the van and do it outside, so she doesn't endanger the kids' lives? Yeah, I know she's supposed to be suffering a breakdown, but her prediction would not have come true had she, herself, not set up the domino effect that made it happen.The rest of TCMtR is pure Hollywood contrivance. There is the requisite musical score overkill and the squelchy sound effects (remember the creepy, constant drill of the generator from the original? that was rad). There is the snappish MTV editing and direction (compare to the amateurish documentary look and feel of the original). There is the government anti-drug/anti-sex message, and good grief, it is set to "Sweet Home Alabama"!! There is also Jessica Biel in a cowboy hat. Jessica Biel in a wet tee-shirt. Jessica Biel with her head cradled in R. Lee Ermey's naked crotch. (Sheriff Ermey gets to play the best character, a Real Texan who yells and swears and scares the bejesus out of those of us terrified of the South and her reputation for vigilante 'justice' and lynching parties.)Altogether TCMtR comes across as a well-above-average made-for-HBO movie--it's not bad, really, and often it's entertaining; ultimately, though, it sucks on account of sacrificing story to gore. After two solid hours of nonstop jump scenes and bloody murder, of heaping on the bodies and the body parts and the body fluids, we simply acclimate to the violence. The audience become passive witnesses, and the movie becomes predictable, unscary, and boring.Also there's no cannibalism. AND DID I MENTION THERE'S NO CANNIBALISM?!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a hardened spectator; that means, I have only seen a couple films in my whole life which I considered scary. I like horror films but usually get disappointed with them, as 99% of them do not frighten me in any way. This one did. It is an extremely consistent and successful effort to create a sense of horror which is, in the end, the ultimate means of the genre. It is not even about the plot; it is about the director's possibility to create an atmosphere of hopelessness which penetrates the film from the beginning on. The tension is built in a masterful manner, cinematic means like light, soundtrack and camera shots highlight the events in the most fitting way, the pace is just right, all elements contribute to a consistently thrilling and gruesome outcome. This film seems very modern in its effects and camera style but somehow retro in its imagery which is a successful tribute to the original version of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre". A seldom example of a good remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You have to understand, I went into this with high hopes as it was recommended to me by people who I thought had good taste in these types of movies. Then again some of them liked Underworld, and well now I know better...***MAJOR MAJOR SPOILERS!!! SKIP MY ENTIRE REVIEW IF YOU ARE SET ON SEEING THIS MOVIE!!****** . . . .The plot has been covered by many on here already so I'm only going to gloss over it to bring you to the points of the film where I could only shake my head in disbelieve over just how bad this flick is. First off we start with a psuedo archived evidence film of some cops going through the house that the movie takes place in, obviously this is after the whole main part of the movie has ocured. Here we are tricked by the narrator into thinking that no one in this movie is going to survive. So far off to a good start.Next the actual movie kicks in with the 5 kids in the van. Jesica Biel quickly asserts herself of being the tough, but prudeish stereotypical character one can find in the worst horror films of the past, the bad Nightmare on Elm Street movies (as in not the first or third one) or Jason movies. She's tough, she has values that clash with everyone else in the van and she's not going to let anyone get away with anything that might save their lives later on ("Lets dump the body." "No she has a family who misses her.")They pick up a tattered hitch hiker who is obviously been through some sort of ordeal. Once in the van and on the road she begins to shout that they are going the wrong way and that they should turn around because 'SHE'S NOT GOING BACK THERE!' then she eats a bullet from a gun she had hiding somewhere I don't even want to try and guess at. After what I felt was a poorly done yet trendy POV shot through her open skull what does our terrified group of teenagers do? Head back to the last gas-station, eatery or whatever last stop they had hit before picking her up?? NO! Of course not, no one even suggests that, no they keep going in the same direction the girl warned them about (yet I believe it's the same direction she was walking in when they picked her up, wtf??)Then there's the wierd encounter at the shop where the sheriff tells them to meet him at some random location in 30 minutes after they had reported her suicide. Time to go find a better piece of civilization? Nope. Sure they pad the audience by arguing amongst themselves about why a cop would do such a thing, but like the brainless dorks that are needed to make this movie work they continue on to the meeting place anyways.They get to the meeting spot and the sheriff is not there, and although it's super creepy, they stick around anyways.Eventually they get to the house with the psycho-family and the killing starts. People begin dropping pretty fast and there's some good tense moments near the beginning of all of this, but it's nothing new or fresh. You can guess who's going to get killed next. "No only she can come in and use the phone..." (10 minutes later) "Honey?? Where did you go??"... (search, search, dead). It's in the lackluster camera work and stereo-typical music. Nothing feels new or terribly creative about this film. I do have to say the cinematography is nice, in that 'they had alot of money to through into the computer filtering process' way. It worked on some levels but it failed in presenting the bleak, hot, scorched earth like surroundings I was hoping to see. Something that would have helped this movie out. I felt the surroundings where not nearly as erie as they could have been.Fast forward to the end of the movie and let me get to some of my favorite parts.* Did anwyone else immediatly realise Morgan was kidding the second he stuck his arm in the car?* The dude from Heavy Metal Jacket actualy says at one point "Get up you Maggot!" LOL!! It's just like Mail Call!* Beil puts a long over due 'WTF IS HE STILL DOING ALIVE??' character mercifully to rest by... wait scratch the mercy part.... BY STABBING HIM IN THE STOMACH WITH A HUGE KNIFE!!?!!?!! WHAT?!? For god sakes, the guy was missing a leg, how about cutting his make shift dressings and let him bleed to death? Slit his neck?? CUT A MAJOR ARTERY IN HIS LEG??? ANYTHING BUT INFLICTING ONE OF THE SLOWEST MOST PAINFUL WOUNDS TO HIS ALREADY MISERABLE SITUATION!?!??? I don't think she likes men.* This one I still can't believe happened. Leatherface DROPS HIS RUNNING CHAINSAW TO THE GROUND while wrestling another character, Beil who's standing right next to them both and completely free to manuever..... well she beats on Leatherface's back and tells him to "STOP!", meanwhile the chainsaw is within easy reach. She could have AT LEAST kicked it away from him and saved... wait, it's another guy character, that explains it.* This waif of a girl chops off Leatherface's arm with a butcher knife in about 5 - 10 seconds. Right through the bone, and his arm which is about a foot thick.* She saves the baby... of course! The second the baby entered the movie, I saw the expected Hollywood (and safe for test audiances) ending beginning to brew. . . .See the original, or House of a 1000 Corpses for some decent horror in this genre. Not this high budget, no creativity, poorly written movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful and Exciting Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the best remakes around*SPOLIERS AHEAD*Plot: Five teenagers, Erin (Jessica Biel), Kemper (Eric Balof), Andy (Mike Vogel), Morgan (Jonathan Tiersten), and Pepper (Erica Leersen) are driving through Texas to a concert when they pick up a deranged hitchhiker who warns them against the route their taking and promptly shoots herself through her mouth. They drive to an ab anded mill to wait for the sheriff (R.E. Leermy) to come and pick up the body. Weird occurrences happen and as the night progresses the teenagers have to fight to stay alive from the fury known as Leatherface (Andrew Bynarski)The Good News: This film takes no prisoners and is pretty brutal in dealing with our characters. The family, especially the sheriff played brilliantly by R.E. Leermy really enjoys torturing the kids and I personally think that Leatherface here is the scariest of them all. I love the mask here and the movements he makes and his brutality is really amazing. Andrew Bynarski makes a truly impressive Leatherface. Also noteworthy Is Jessica Biel who delivers a raw and emotional performance which rivals Marilyn Burns performance from the original and she could become the next scream queen of this era of horror if she took on a few more roles like this. The rest of the supporting cast is good with no real standouts, but nobody impresses themselves either. The film is shot beautifully by Marcus Nispel and at first glance a horror film with dark muted colors all through the running time may seem like a bad choice, but it works wonders here and during the second half you get a serious case of claustrophobia. You really believe they are in the middle of nowhere and makes the events that happen that much more urgent. People have attacked the script and called it sloppy and hackneyed, but I seriously couldn't find anything wrong. The score helps the film out Marjory and elevates it to a scale which the actors cant. The score never hurts the film and the prime example of this is the dramatic scene where Erin is forced to kill Andy. It's powerful enough with just the actor's expressions and movements, but with the score it becomes something truly special. You literally feel the tension and feel like you're there and this is really happening which is the object of every horror movie and this one secedes. Very noteworthy. This film also contains a classic use of suspense. The entire second half is incredibly suspenseful and provides shocks and chills. Watching this film at one in the morning made watching the trailer scene almost unbearable. That scene made me want to turn it off and finish it in broad daylight. The torture is pretty impressive and the gore is smartly done, never throwing gallons of blood on the screen at every kill instead making the blood very realistic and nice. The footage in the beginning and end of the movie was also a nice touch. This is definitely one of the better remakes around and does the original justice. The missing dinner scene wasn't a problem and just kept the action at a constant speed. The film never bores you and it has a high re watch ability factor. This could've been a ton worse.The Bad News: The only complaint I have is there really needs to be a bigger body count and there needs to be more chainsaw deaths.Conclusion: Recommend highly to fans of the original and for all other who have a passion for horror films or are getting started in watching horror movies, but if you are a expecting a great big massacre go ahead and still watch it and just know that if you want a massacre you'll have to watch a Friday the 13th. Recommend.Rated: R</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's face it. There aren't, if any, good horror classic remakes. Good horror movies are not supposed to be remade, period. However, there are some remakes that come pretty close to "good" remakes, (such as The Ring) and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of them. I watched this movie alone in the dark at midnight, with my DTS surround sound speakers, and it scared the HELL out of me! This movie intends to makes you feel damp, filthy and frightening. It takes itself very seriously, no jokes. The horror is non-stop, not allowing you to take a break. The fright and the gore satisfies most horror fans. Good style, good cinematography, well-directed. Of course, this movie cannot be compared to the original, but this is a pretty damn good horror movie itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a great film. On a miniscule budget, Tobe Hooper managed to create a classic horror movie, who's title is known worldwide. This remake is nothing like the original. If anything, it's LESS gory, and not scary at all. The thing that makes the original scary is the sheer insanity of all the killing, and all the other things that happen to the main character (the dinner scene, for example...watching it still makes me want to cover my eyes). All the "horror" of the new version is from the old "surprise!...something jumps out of hiding and makes a loud sound" trick. By the end of the movie (which is about 30 min. longer than the original), I'd seen the "surprise!" trick so many times that I didn't even blink at it anymore.***MINOR SPOILER ALERT*** * * * One last complaint about this remake (and it's a BIG one). Leatherface takes off his mask. In fact, other members of his family try to make the victims pity him by explaining that he was disfigured by a childhood disease. The point of the mask, according to Tobe Hooper was that Leatherface didn't have a personality or background of any sort. It's scarier that way. ***END SPOILER***Final Verdict: Every time somebody buys a ticket for this movie, God kills a baby dolphin. It's that bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horrible remake for a generation full of suckers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*For all you kiddies out there, here is the movie that will make you pee in your little britches. Teens should love this movie: after all it has a big breasted Jessica Biel to ogle over; it has a slick and polished music video look that the TRL lovers will go for; it has young love and lust, including a fledgling marriage and a never-to-be used engagement ring, shown in a tragic scene that's sure to make the teenage girlies whine in unison; and of course it has enough digitized chainsaw sound effects to make the teens jump in their seats and cover their eyes.The sad thing about this remake, is that it has spawned a generation full of people who think this is what a horror movie should be. And yet another sad fact, is that some teenagers believe this movie contains real footage, and there's still a leatherface running around out there in Texas somewhere. I bet high school hallways are ripe with ditzy comments on leatherface's whereabouts. And yet sadder still, most teens probably believe this remake is better than the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre.After all of this I probably come off sounding like an old curmudgeon, but if you've ever been on the TCM remake message board, you'd get the same impression as I.Don't get me wrong; the teenagers will eat this movie up. It was after all, made for the teen market. But any TRUE fan of the original TCM will be very disappointed in this unintelligent, hollywoodized remake.So if you're a teen, out looking for a decent horror movie to see, I suggest you see this remake, you have license to see it. But if you're a mature movie viewer, especially a horror fan, and you go see this movie and end up liking this god-awful remake; you should be ashamed of yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"They are all dead!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1974, director Tobe Hooper made a film that caused a huge impact not only horror film-making, but the movies in general. Made out of a tiny budget and shot on a grainy snuff film look, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE scared millions worldwide. Of course, this all gave birth to a strong cult lead that made the movie remain popular to this day on, making it a cult classic. Sequels aside, this legacy was carried to this day on and eventually gave birth to a 2003 remake.Produced by Michael Bay and directed by music-video specialist Marcus Nispel, the new TCM hits theaters pretending it is a tribute while in reality it is a big-budget attempt to cash in the original on name value. When I first heard about this movie, I was completely negative about it. The fact that the same man who directed bombs such as PEARL HARBOR produced it made me even more skeptical. And my opinion didn't change a thing after watching this.The biggest mistake is that the makers forgot that back in 1974, TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE was brand new stuff. And we all know that today it is nothing but been-here-done-that material. How many movies about a psycho icing teenagers in a cold, lifeless way have been done over the years? Uncountable! So knowing that today's moviegoers wouldn't want to see such lack of new material, a wise move was done by adding the "based on a true story" tag on trailers and posters. But here is the catch: If you didn't know, the original TCM was loosely based on the real-life crimes of Ed Gein. And "based" is a very strong word. By adding this tag on this remake, the makers will manipulate the young audience into believing this entire absurdity that they just watched happened in real life. This is no surprise remembering producer Bay did the exact same thing on his 2001 "classic" PEARL HARBOR.Like the original, the remake begins with a John Laroquette narration (Laroquette also narrated the original film) explaining that what you are about to see happened in real life. The audience in the screening I was in laughed out loud when they realized that what today would be a big BLAIR WITCH PROJECT cliche was not removed. Is this Michael Bay's idea of impressing today's audience?We then move to the story: It is a beautiful morning inside a van where five pot-smoking friends are on their way to Mexico for a concert when they run into an unusual female hitchhiker. The woman warns they are all going to die and then shoots herself in the mouth. This follows a STENDHAL SYNDROME-like shot as the camera travels through the bullet-hole. The friends all decide to stop, split up, and search for help. This all leads to them all getting killed by a scary cannibal maniac by the name of Leatherface.While the original was shot on a crude snuff-like grainy reel, this one is done on a simply breath-taking MTV-esque digital photography. The dusty roads and the hot Texas atmosphere is captured perfectly in the day-time scenes. It is interesting to add that cinematographer Daniel Pearl also shot the 1974 original. The new look is quite welcome. Not so welcome is the new cast that looks like a bunch of stars from a WB prime time teen drama. In fact, two of the actors did. One of the best things about the original is that the characters looked and acted like real people, even knowing most of their acting was terrible. The remake has better and more good-looking actors playing cliched unrealistic jocks that you never care about.What follows is that all friends become victims of cannibal killer Leatherface and his family. And of course, we all know Leatherface's weapon of choice. What follows are flashy brutal killings that never really manage to be scary. One character is surprised by the killer and gets hit in the head. Another one is impaled in a hook and gets his/her leg sewed off. Other ones are all "chainsawed" to death. Describing the murders, I will go back to early 2003 when this remake was in pre-production. "This will be a less-gory, more-thrilling version of the original," said Bay. Well, Bay lied. While TCM '74 managed to shock the audience without money shots or close ups, the remake shows everything in bleeding color.This all rounds up to a cliched unsuspenseful chase that lasts forever and takes place in slaughterhouse while a heavy storm strikes outside. Director Nispel tries too hard to improve the original, and ends up in a over-the-top mess. The original didn't need any rain machines or hiding moments, it just gave us a realistic suspenseful chase. This one goes to the extreme of absurdity, with protagonist Erin, who graduated from the Jamie Lee Curtis School of Survival, fighting back at the killer and eventually winning. The fact that unconvincing actress Jessica Biel looks like she's in a wet T-shirt contest doesn't help.The entire movie is orchestrated by Steve Jablovnsky, who at the beginning recycles the brilliant original 1974 material, but then sticks to the usual bombastic suspenseful orchestra that takes all the tension away. The music for the original flick was totally wacked (Like the film itself) and this one goes for the more usual direction.But while there is still no reason why a low-budget 1974 horror film should be more effective than a high-budget 2003 remake, the new version is never as disturbing as the original. Remember how when the original ended, you felt just like you had been through, and escaped, hell? Remember how disturbing those chase scenes with Sally (The original's protagonist) running for her life were? Remember the moments when Sally crashed through those windows while running from Leatherface? Remember how good and relieved you felt when Sally escaped the house and laughed hysterically? You never get these emotions out of the remake! Instead, when this one ends, you feel like you've just watched another forgetable horror movie, and this one is one of them.If the original 1974 movie had just been released today, it would have a quick life and a short death. And this one is no different. But it was how original and terrifying the first one was back in 1974 that made it what it is today. The 2003 remake is no more terrifying than recent weak-but-fun scary flicks like WRONG TURN or CABIN FEVER. Rent the original instead to see what a disturbing motion picture really is.0/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Patently awful remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake blatantly shows the audience everything that the original merely implied, and tried NOT to show its audiences, and it does so with dull and uninspiring camera-work and lighting, and all of the subtlety of a sledgehammer through a plate glass window of the Antebellum farmhouse this film partially takes place in. Which, incidentally, was supremely creepy. It's a shame there was nothing else in the way of atmosphere or suspense in the rest of the movie.Interesting opening basically begins where the original film ended: with the lone survivor from the slaughter the night before being picked up, not by a truck driver this time, but by a van full of teenagers on a road trip. The new passenger is not a killer-in-waiting like in the original, but the last remaining survivor from the previous evening's slaughter. But all hope for the teenagers in the van, (and us, the audience, for enjoying a good horror movie) is quickly shot to hell, as our survivor decides that she would rather die than keep surviving, and pulls a gun out ..... from her vag? Then blows her brains out in the back of the van. What, she figured that she had escaped her captors and survived the night and now there was nothing else to do in life? Or was that her way of celebrating her escape? The five in the van decide to go get help, and from then on, the film degenerates into a seemingly never-ending chase between our joy riding friends, and psycho family with a chainsaw wielding brother.As others have mentioned, this strips away the dusty, gritty look of the original, and replaces it with gore and water and bloodshed and lots more water. Inbreeding and police corruption and anti-drug messages (far too politically correct, for supposedly taking place in 1973) are even given screen time here, as is a concert in Mexico. Far too much confusion and cluttering of the original film's basic and simple (and superior) screenplay.Several scenes in the original were so shocking and effective because they came from out of nowhere and surprised the hell out of us (Kirk's sledgehammer-to-the-head death immediately comes to mind) But here the filmmakers keep the intensity going all throughout (or at least, they try to) and never gives the viewer a chance to breathe, which is probably what the filmmakers' goal was. But the problem then is that we become desensitized to it, and ultimately bored by it. "Oh, look, it's another blockhead being chased with a chainsaw. Hmm." Speaking of blockheads, the characters in the original acted like normal people, while here they are all obnoxious nitwits. So, whenever one ends up killed, it is more of a relief, because that just means that there is one less obnoxious nitwit whining and arguing.The twelve producers(!) of this dreck, including original producers Kim Henkle and Tobe Hooper, took one of the most infamous titles in the history of film (if one goes to Burkina Faso, they've heard of the original Texas Chain Saw Massacre there!) and diluted it in this remake to nothing more than a formulaic, and contrived, Hollywood remake.Good first scene, creepy looking house, and Jessica Biel's gorgeous body are all this film has going for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Remake, Original Take</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before going to see this movie for the first time in theaters, I decided that I'd rent the original version to get a little insight. I thought the original was good for being made in the 70s, but nothing all too great. Everyone says the cinematography and effect it had was superior, and ranked far above all other horror films, but I believe it was only a good film of the time, but nothing great.With higher hopes for something good I went to the theater to see the remake and I was amazed at everything I saw. It was filmed so well, and while it was definitely more "Hollywood", it had this absolutely terrific effect on me. Seeing the brutal and horrifying things this movie showed left me in a state of awe. I left the theater along with everyone else in a shocked and chilled state of mind.I don't think anyone could have remade this film any better at any other time. In my opinion this version, this remake, far surpasses the remake in many ways. It actually accomplished the task of making me feel scared, while the original just left me bored and not too interested. Of course though, if the original were not made this one would not exist, but people should stop putting the remake down and calling it "crap", when the original wasn't all that great in the first place.Altogether I was very impressed with this film, and if you want to see more of the Hewitt family murders you should check out The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning. It is just as good, maybe even better in some aspects.Please do note though that although they state it as being "inspired by a true story," it is not actually "based" on a true story. It was inspired by Ed Gein and if you watch the special features on the 2-Disc DVD of this film you will get more insight into the inspiration Tobe Hooper got for the original film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disturbing film but still you cant turn away!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is the beginning of the return of old school horror. This film however has brought up a lot of controversy, due to the fact that it is a remake of one of horror's greatest classics. I am not one that gets very excited about remakes, in fact I usually do not like the idea to recreate something that was done nearly perfect the first time. However, with this film I was pleasantly surprised and I enjoyed it. Granted I feel Tobe Hooper's original "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is far superior film. There are many aspects of the movie I thought were done well and there some I had a bit of problem with.The cinematography was very impressive and I definitely feel that the director achieved a good dark and hell-like setting in Texas. The acting was also very believable. One aspect that I did enjoy was that the script was a bit different from Hooper's. In my opinion this almost always helps viewing a remake of a film. I want the director to change some of the script. If I wanted to see the exact same film again I would just view the original. The adding of the twisted sheriff created a great deal of terror. This character was almost as nasty as Leatherface himself. Leatherface was also recreated well. His physique, demeanor, and shear brutality was achieved enough that Gunner Hansen would have been proud. Although Hansen will always be the best actor to wear the stitched human mask and wield the chainsaw.There were however, some changes from the original that I did not agree with. Firstly, I was not 100 percent convinced that the film took place in 1973. Granted the setting achieved a 70s look, I felt the actors were not quite on the same level. For some reason it seemed that they had a present day quality to them, this maybe in part that their dialogue and hair styles seemed a bit off. There was only one scene I had a real problem with which was the lost of Leatherface's arm. During the end of the film he is hunting the last soul survivor in a slaughterhouse, she then jumps from her hiding place and hacks off his arm with a large meat cleaver. The problem I had with this was that Leatherface is quite a large fellow and this girl who could not weigh more half his body weight, whacks off his arm with I believe four hacks. After the first blow one would think he would either move or knock her away, but it was almost like he just stood there letting her swing at his arm as if it was a tree. Basically in this film Leatherface does not come out quite as the victor as he did in the original film. I think that's one aspect the made the original so disturbing, the villains actually win.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Things to learn about remake slasher classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being one of the few commenter's on TCM that hasn't seen the original, and is only 15 years old, I thought my 2 cents in would be considered useful or interesting to contrast to that of other comments written on this movie. I watched this movie hoping to be freaked out. I wanted to scare myself. But to be honest, I spent most of the time critiquing the directing of this movie and the way Nispel has tried to create and attain the climax of this movie. The only thing truly massacred in this film was the potential of gore and thrill. The over-dramatic music, inappropriate choice of costume and actors massacred the message the producers were trying to get across. Like all slasher films, the only thing you're meant to achieve out of watching it is a few hours of having the sh*t scared out of you. And the sad thing is the raw thrill of this movie could have fulfilled that, but instead was squashed by its modernistic screenplay. Throughout most of the film, i believed the face shown on Leatherface was what was meant to be depicted as his own, only to realize that was a skin-made mask. I'm still waiting to find a villain truly horrific and disgustingly distorted that their image is tattooed into your mind every time you shut your eyes. The highlight of this movie would have been the scene with Jessica Biel and her limp friend finding refuge in a house that they first tried to secure shut with a lounge. I congratulate Nispel on the way he created the sense of being, for want of a better word, "so close yet so far" from death. The supposed "footage" found really killed this movie. Particularly when you've just been reading up on what this movie really is based on (which isn't, much to my friends dismay, a man psychologically challenged with a skin disease and a chainsaw). Above all, i felt lied to! The only thing people should take away from this "slasher" film is- JUST BECAUSE THEIR FILM EDITOR CAN MAKE A SCENE APPEAR 80 YEARS OLD FILMED WITH A 1950'S CAMCORDER DOESN'T MEAN THERE REALLY IS A DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY OF CANNIBALS WITH A SON WITH SKIN DISEASE THAT TAKES HIS ANGER AND RESENTMENT OUT ON TEENAGERS BY DETACHING LIMBS WITH A CHAINSAW RUNNING WILD IN THE OUTBACK OF AUSTIN, Texas!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly really scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(SPOILER WARNING) It has been 30 years since the nation was shocked by the extreme carnage of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Now, 30 years later and numerous horrible attempts to re-create it, we are presented with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2003. It takes so much effort to create a remake that has the same shock value or scare tactics as the originals. This is an example that had that success. Although it was different, it had its moments that everyone actually thought as if it were the original. It is a hip and scary film with a new twist to the teen horror genre. And as for recent horror films such as, Cabin Fever, Freddy vs. Jason, Wrong Turn, and Cold Creek Manor; they add virtually nothing new to the genre. This has the effect that had the theater screaming and talking about for weeks after. Five estranged, hormone driven teens are on a road trip to Dallas, Texas for a Lynard Skinnard concert. On the way they made a quick stop at the neighboring Mexico to buy a load of marijuana. On their way, they pick up a stunned and extremely traumatized hitchhiker. Disturbing comments and a graphic suicide lead to the gritty violent content and gore that we are faced with. Scenes of graphic torture involve a guy getting his knee sawed off and being hung on a meat hook through the back. Adding to the torturing, it leads to rock salt being placed on the wound and where the knee once was. The acting is surprisingly fresh and you become involved with the characters and find them greatly unfortunate instead of the way the victims usually die. Most of time the characters are so dumb that you just want them to die. In this movie, it is a different story. In the final clips of the film, it shows `actual footage' of the real mass murderer most commonly known as `Leatherface.' It gives a Blair Witch-ian style to it. Disturbing and immensely scary, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is sensitive to gore and/or who scares easily. I found myself glued to the screen, not being able to take my eyes away for one moment. This is definitely one of the top horror movies I have ever seen and it brings a brand new meaning to the words scary and disturbingly violent. The killings are so realistic and the gore as well. I would recommend this movie for any horror fan and anybody that enjoys a good scare. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Typical horror movie beginnings sometimes lend way to fantastic journeys. ok, maybe not here, but this movie did kick large amounts of ass. it really didn't try too hard to be the original, and that was smart. the original was good, but you have to put it in context. i don't think people could watch the first half hour of the original without being bored out of their skulls, having never seen it before. but since i've seen it dozens of times, i know what carnage lies ahead.but, this is a new day. you can't treat horror the same way. we're scared by "jacob's ladder" and "the sixth sense." TCM-2K3 reflects this. don't expect lingering, tacky antagonist camera shots, ala freddy kreuger. this movie is supposed to have some mystery. so what, if we don't see every stitch of leatherface. that's not the point.the cast wasn't remarkable, but, more importantly, they weren't annoying. you really did kinda feel bad for them. i really dig how they were able to capture the same feeling of "creepiness" as the original, but through different means.finally, i need to give important marks to the director for camera work. very innovative shot keep the film alive, and any horror gimmicks that were used were not over used. editing was timely and precise; no need to show more than necessary. go see this in the theater!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was amazing and though some characters were not the same as the original.....it all worked out great. It was a superb horror movie. I jumped out of my seat and was screaming at the screen. That is a true horror flick, when you really are scared and worked up. I wasn't like that with the original. And I must say, I HATED Jessica Biel until this movie, she really did an excellent job. Two thumbs up to her. For those who have weak stomachs, this flick is not for you. It is gruesome, gory, bloody and psychotic. I loved it. Something I must add for those who think this movie is true. I don't care what your parents say, or what your so-called 'sources' say.....this movie is only a movie. It is loosely based on the killer, Ed Gein, which most smart people already know. So many argue their guys out saying this movie is true, when in reality, Tobe just took Ed Gein's craziness and made it into an absolutely stomach-churning (and quite disturbing) thriller. I give it a 10, and recommend everyone see it as well as the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fresh adaptation of a classic. Well done! *minor spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this remake opening night and I was completely immersed in it within the first 10 minutes.The acting was great on everyone's part. I thought Jessica Biel did a great job shedding her WB persona and was totally believable as Erin (yes fellas, she's hot, but I think it's her talent that really counts here.) Big screen newcomer Mike Vogel made his pain seem so authentic that my skin crawled! And of course, mad props to R. Lee Ermey who did a bang up job portraying the sometimes funny, but ultimately disturbing county sheriff. Also worth mentioning was Lauren German as the teenage girl in the opening scene.There was only one thing that disappointed me and that was the persistent presence of Leatherface. For example, the scene with him sewing the mask in the basement could have been taken out. I believe the less we see of him, the more surreal and frightening he is when he is present.Other than that, no real complaints. I thought the script was a fresh adaptation of the original. It wasn't the scariest movie, but it was creepy and it did make me jump a couple times! And in response to critics who call the movie "too brutal," how can we call this movie more brutal than such acclaimed classics as Scarface, The Godfather, or more recently Kill Bill? I liked all of these movies but I can't agree that one form of violence is more acceptable or appropriate than another.But anyways, if you do see TCM, be sure to catch it while it's hot. Movies like this are always better when you have the reaction of the audience!</fullReview>

The plot is very good, character development is excellent, and the use of gore to scare isn't overdone by much. I guess what scares you the most is that it really seems realistic, and perhaps the idea that it's inspired by a true story. But anyway, I recommend this movie to everyone who enjoys a good scare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I had a lot of expectations for this movie and, for the most part, I was not let down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really love to see a horror movie, and when a good movie comes along I'm very happy. I feel that a lot of people confuse what the real definition of horror actually is. According to the dictionary, horror is defined as "an intense, painful feeling of repugnance and fear." I feel that this can used to also describe the horror genre of cinema. A horror movie must be intense and have it's audience on the edge of their seats. We have to dislike what happens to the characters to like the movie, i.e. we don't want to see one of the main characters die, but characters have to die in order for it to be horror. So horror has to be intense, scary ( having us fear elements within it), and gory. Let's face it some people like intense movies that mess with your mind, others like movies that make you jump, and some people like a good old-fashioned gore fest.Now, although I feel Hollywood needs to get new ideas and stop with remaking old movies, I was really excited about one of the greatest pieces of horror being remade with today's technology and budget. I had a lot of expectations for this movie and, for the most part, I was not let down.There are SPOILERS from this point on mixed through out my review First, the actual plot was quite good. You were led to actually have a feel for the characters, which were decently developed and rounded. You truly feel the anguish and disgust of the characters. The development of the Hewitt family was interesting, especially when we discover how large the family actually is and how they occupy the small town. The develop the idea that they have done this many times and are quite good at it. They develop leatherface's character of how he could kill so easily because he is deeply tormented by a troubled past from the mistreatment of his mother who was selfish and his own disfigurement from his disease. Each actor, especially R. Lee Ermey, did a great job portraying either the victims or the family.Next, the direction was also good. I enjoyed the camera angles, the colors, the art, the lighting, and the choice of locations. I liked that the original narrator came back. However, I did not enjoy the ending. I did like how it went back to the narration, I'm talking about the actual end of events. I did not like how they left it so... empty. They didn't explain why they kept the baby, why the teenager in the beginning was so excessively bloody (I get it and I don't), and how she just kind of escaped, with no explanation of where she was going or what she was going to do. Other than that, the direction was good. Now, the intensity of the movie was excellent. The whole movie was an intense ride, slowly pulling you in and then going crazy with some twists. To have intensity, there must be elements that scare the audience and disgust them (not so much gore, more situations and circumstances). I felt this movie was scary and disturbing, which makes it have great intensity.Finally, the gore factor in the movie, I felt, was somewhat left out. I like psychological horror, which this also can be considered, but I love gore. I felt that they let me down a little bit through letting your mind show you what happened, when I would have much rather just have been showed.There were enough deaths, but they weren't bloody nor gory (with the exception of two characters: the hitchhiker's suicide, and the teen on the hook whos leg was cut off and stabbed in the stomach. Although it had a lot of killing, there was not enough gore which is essential to a horror movie.As a remake, which turns many people off, it does, I feel, an excellent job. It is not better than the original because the original is unique. It shaped much of horror and it was an excellent view of what horror should be. However, the story changes and modifications were much needed. There was more gore in the remake, considering the original had none. The remake was more frightening and much more realistic and I felt more sympathy for the characters where in the original I never cared much. The original will always be one of my favorite movies but this movie is an excellent choice for a remake. Hopefully this upped the bar for the horror genre so terrible movies are not made anymore. I give this 3 1/2 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is very safe to say that the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre(1974) was a cultural phenomenon for horror movies and helped change the shape of the entire genre. The movie provided all the essential elements that are vital in horror movies because when it comes down to it, these elements come from what the people want to see. We want to see the twisted things in our imaginations and nightmares come to life and what I love about TCM is it is something that could really happen to you. Sure the movie is a little cheesy now and I think Franklin was hilarious, but its the direction that counts. To me Leatherface is the greatest killer of all time, I like him better than Freddy. I love him because he is very stripped down, he's not supernatural and reacts to pain like any normal human would. He has all the essentials such as a very creepy image and psychotic behavior. Nobody can hold a candle to Leatherface.Ok enough of that, let me get on to the review of the REAL Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I will not say anything about the story because I want everyone to see it for themselves while knowing very little about the story. It takes a lot for a movie to impress me when the anticipation level is hitting the sky because I expect so much and usually always get disappointed, this happened with Terminator 3. With the "new" TCM, it stays true to the roots that made the first one a hit, but this one BLEW me away.Lets start with the cast. Everyone was amazing and fit in perfectly. I had doubts about Jessica Biels at first but now I see her in a brand new light. I could see no ounce of weakness in any of the characters. The moods expressed throughout the movie were flawless and very convincing. The acting plays a huge role because the better the acting, the more real the feel is, thats when you step into the shoes of the people in the movie and live it out with them. This is what makes and breaks movies and I'm proud to say the cast delivered.The story line has been totally changed. This story is 100 times better than the original, I was very impressed. There are far more twists and turns and because the storyline has such a high thrill value, it keeps you glued to your seat. Our theater was packed and only 2 people that I know of left for bathroom breaks. I have never seen this happen before with a movie. Anyway, the storyline could not have gotten any better. One reviewer said some of the stuff in the movie was predictable, that is total BS, this movie has so many turns that you have no idea whats going to happen next.Now onto the star of the movie, LEATHERFACE. I thought nobody could top Gunnar Hansen from the first TCM but Leatherface in the new one is the best one I have ever seen. He is bigger, scarier, meaner, and crazier than ever. He is the main focus as far as enemies go and I think its great, this pretty much paid tribute to him and it shows everyone that he is the guy to be reckoned with. The moment he did the first kill I knew this movie was ON and had a feeling it would top any slasher movie ever made.In closing let me say that when this movie ended, A LOT of people started clapping and cheering. I saw no disappointed faces leaving that theater and this was the first movie ever in which my high anticipation was exceeded, let alone met. I don't care what ANYONE says, the original, while still a classic and will always be in our hearts, can't even come close to this one. Storyline, imagery, jump scenes, kills, twists etc.., this movie has it ALL and leaves a lasting impression strong enough to make you want to go pay $7.50 all over again and again and again until you get sick of it. Michael Bay, a lot of people doubted you when you signed on to this but I always defended you and let me say, I know you have shut all those people up. Job well done!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best movies i've ever seen! Usually a considered scary movie doesn't scare me. Texas Chainsaw Massacre had my nerves shaken up for a long time after i saw it. The part of it being based on true facts made it a lot scarier to me. I liked the way parts of the movie, when u least expected it, scared you by things happening unexpectedly! It was so cool and fun too. Ive never seen a better movie than this one. Lots of movies i rate as good movies but this one was great! Theres nothing better than a scary movie to actually be scary. i recommend everyone to see this exciting, scary movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TEXAS CHAINSAW WAS MUCH BETTER THAN I EXPECTED</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went last night to see Texas Chainsaw even though I had read a review by Roger Ebert in our local paper yesterday morning that gave it one star. Ebert didn't say one good thing about the movie. I thought the trailers looked so good that I decided to see it anyway. It was just awesome and definitely worth seeing. Don't be fooled by any bad reviews. I loved the first one, but this one was even better and much scarier. I literally jumped right off the seat at least five or six times. It is very gory but it wasn't just one gory scene after another, it was very suspenseful and I liked the way it was filmed in terms of lighting, camera angles, etc. My husband and I are in our forties and we took two 16-year-olds and three 14-year-olds and everyone loved it. I found it terrifying and very well done. If you like good horror movies, go see this!</fullReview>

For the past decade or so I thought, gone were the days that I cared about any horror characters actually surviving the terror. I usually want every character to die a horrible death. Not here. I wanted them to survive. Well, at least one or two of them. Which makes the horror even more terrifying. I know people are going to hate this film right off the bat cause it's a remake of an already great classic. It's tough to compare two films that have so many years between them. Films today have the luxury of looking back. They have better tools, more talents, better sound, film, and bigger budgets. The great thing about the original Chainsaw Massacre is that the lack of all this actually made it better. Edgier. Like it was the actual film of the events that took place. The new film has a lot going for it too. All the changes are welcomed. Not better, just different. Otherwise, what's the point of re-visiting a film made 30 years ago if not to change it a bit. Why are so many die hard fans so opposed to re-making something that worked to begin with? What's the harm? If you see the remake, try to judge it on its own merits. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excellent remake of a fantastic horror movie! In fact, I almost like this version better than the original. Like the original, it focused less on gore and more on suggestive violence. Of course there was plenty of gore, but it wasn't a complete and utter gore fest. Great fun for those with strong stomachs and an even stronger constitution. 8 stars, maybe even 9 or 10. Great show!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Horror Film in a Long Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I was walking to the theater door to see this earlier today, I kept thinking I was just going to witness another "Wrong Turn (2003)" But I saw exactly the opposite. This film is a lot better than the other horror films that came out this year. The direction in this movie was outstanding. It gives you a feel that you are actualy there but also delivers some very cool shots. The lighting and cinematography were also very well done.It has all the major ingredients that go into making of a good horror film. There was gore (which wasnt over done at all but there was still plenty), suspense (which I thought was almost unbearable at times), black humor (which really disturbed me and then made me feel sick for actually laughing at it)...I could go on but I wont.The acting was excellent! Jessica Biel done better than I had expected and hit all the high notes perfectly. At least she didn't only scream for the last hour of the movie. I enjoyed every minute she was on screen. R. Lee Ermey was excellent in this film. He actaully made me believe that he was a sicko and a few times I feared him more than Leatherface. I wish they could have showed more of his character (Dinner scene maybe?). The supporting cast was also outstanding.I do have a few complaints though. First, I didn't really enjoy the musical score all that much. I wish they had just used the one from the original. But granted the music was good to help scare you into some really disturbing scenes so I guess it was okay... Second, I miss the big escape from the end of the original. That ending gave you a sense that it could be the end of the survivor if he/she does the wrong thing. Don't get me wrong this one did too, but not like the original. The ending here had its cliched moments but was still thrilling and heart-stopping.But this was a wonderful horror film that I plan to see again soon! I'm glad this came out. I was getting ready to give up on the new Hollywood horror films. THE SAW IS FINALLY BROUGHT BACK TO LIFE!***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary, Mean, but could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Might be the scariest movie I've ever seen. Don't usually fall for "boo" tactics where the movie makes you jump...this one got me. And several times. The entire theatre shrieked at least five times --- the only thing I can compare that to is the laughter volume during the original American Pie.There were a few things I didn't like. (SPOILERS) The whole mention of skin disease was not needed. That line from Henrietta was there for the audience...and it was unnecessary because after Leatherface removed his mask earlier we can clearly see for ourselves he's got a problem. It doesn't have to be overexplained.The "look" of the movie was beautiful. However, there were a few instances, mostly during night sequences, when the lighting was too perfect and in these moments (but not so much during daylight sequences) I think the movie would have benefited from the grainier texture of the original. (Each film utilized the same cinematographer...So with that in mind we have the following: Hooper directs I &amp; II. Two sucked. Henkel co-wrote I and wrote/directed IV. IV sucked. Now we got Daniel Pearle on I &amp; V. Both of these were pretty damn good. Not hard to tell which individual was able to keep their mojo on this one. Congrats (and thank you) Daniel Pearle.Final note: Leatherface was a bad S.O.B. in this one...and stealing the show, as he did in Full Metal Jacket....well it might be the best supporting role I've ever seen in any horror movie ever...you know who I'm talking about if you've seen the film. If you haven't...go.</fullReview>

Lee Ermey is disturbingly realistic.plus the addition of footage at the end is disturbingly intense and frightening.i give THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE 10/10 because i think its possibly the best horror remake to date.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's see... I'm huge fan of TCM franchise and of course I think this movie is brilliant but... There's always but. Even if you're not into TCM or slasher type of horror I think you will love the movie. It's a win - win situation for two reasons. Number one is great atmosphere in the movie (caught the original in my opinion) and number two would be Jessica Biel. She is the true scream queen of modern horror. She was simply perfect in this movie. Murders are very detailed and colorful (not literally :D) but not that bloody as some would expect. All in all, it's a great horror flick and if you're horror buff you are guaranteed to like it. If not the movie, male audience will surely like Jessica Biel (hehe). If you still haven't... Go see this movie now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If a movie with a serial killer has to get a 10, then this is the movie. If you wanna have fun with some buddies, or if you want a girl to spent the night over, this is the movie, since even though it has a lot of scares it does not have brutal raw violence, and if it does,it is not the violence you see in certain horror movies such as Nightmare on Elm street and it definitely is not Braindead.The cast is full of really likable characters, so for the first time in a movie, when somebody dies, you really do feel sad. I cant remember the last time that happened in a movie. The plot and the story is really great and so is the acting. If you saw this movie and did not like it, then I can say for sure that you are not going to like any horror movie. I am telling you, if any scary movie is going to get you laid, then this is the movie. Just keep in mind, that not all girls are in for horror movies. If they are not, try watching A lot like Love with Ashton Kutcher. If none of it works, try working out, taking after your looks and bath every once in a while. That will do the trick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprising and solid remake ***1/2 out of 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me get this straight. I am not one who says remakes are always bad. Like George Romero once said, there's always the original. So whether it be a bad sequel or a bad remake, so what? It doesn't take away from the original like loads of people say.Admittedly if the original is a classic then why remake it? But I actually liked remakes such as 'The Haunting' and 'Dawn of the Dead'.When I heard they were remaking 'Texas Chainsaw' I wasn't too thrilled because one of the things that makes the original the classic it is, is because it's extremely low budget and the film feels extremely REAL. It's almost documentarian in style.When the remake opened up, I went in with an open mind. I came out rather pleased.I must say that the nitty gritty feel of the original wasn't there of course. I don't think this film will go down as a classic by any means, but I do feel it was a good horror film.The style here is filmed in an entirely different way from the original. But it's not a bad change. I feel as a director you need to be making your own movie and not try and copy what the director before you has done.So what we have here is an entirely different entity. Comparing the two as most people will do, the original is far superior. But as a horror film and remake of a classic, it couldn't have been any better.</fullReview>

Combining top-notch production values and great direction by Marcus Nispel, this 2003 remake is easily one of my top horror films. The terror is absolutely unrelenting and it's quite gory for a mainstream release.The acting is outstanding with Jessica Biel and R. Lee Ermey particularly noteworthy in their roles.Finally for the record, this is not a true story as some dumb tenny boppers might insist. We all know by now that it is loosely based on the crimes of Ed. Gein.</fullReview>

I can honnestly say I had never seen a 'frighting' film until this evening.The photography, locations and the acting were very good and there are moments in the film where one can literally FEEL their heart beating at twice its normal rate.A very good film, with many twisted scenes not for the squeemish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ I saw this movie last night reading the reviews of fellow users here on IMDB. Based on the comments, I wasn't expecting much, but as my screen name says, I love scary movies, and this was the next one to see. I went with my boyfriend and he's pretty strong guy, nothing really scares him. During the first 10 minutes, I started to get creeped out. The true footage was scary as anything. I mean, you saw EXACTLY what the police went through when they did the walk through.First of all, the hitch-hiker's death was freaky as hell. But how did she manage to pull a gun out from under her legs? I mean think about it, if it was hidden in her undies, we would have seen the bulge. When she took it out though, and put it in her mouth, I knew it wasn't going to be pretty, and trust me, it wasn't.The deaths were awesome, too. I know that they probably could have done more with them, but it did make me jump. I felt the sorriest for Andy, because throughout the movie, he was hanging on the hook, suffering, just waiting for it all too end. I could see why he wanted Erin to kill him.Throughout the course of the entire movie, there was many surprise elements that just popped out. My boyfriend was covering his eyes on some parts, which freaked me out too. I've never seen the original, but I've heard it was scary. I know that this remake was SCARY. It was scarier than Freddy vs. Jason, House on Haunted Hill, House of the Dead, and Thirteen Ghosts.I don't care what any of you people may say, Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a freakin scary movie and it was awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good movie for fans of gore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was kinda skeptical about this movie being a true fan of the original and a fan of the intrest in the legend itself with Ed Gein and what he did. I was amazed, this film was a very good film and the thing that made it a good film was the way the actors/actresses played their parts, they played them well and you could tell that they had a good time playing their parts in this movie. I was shocked at the gore scenes, especially the one about the hitchhiker in the van. I loved the way the sheriff played his part. And I hated the geek that tried to play his part similar to the guy in the wheelchair that I hated so much as well and I could tell that he was a gonner. The only part that I did not like was the ending, that was so laughable and it spoiled my anticipation of this being a perfect movie. This is a movie that all horror fans of every likeness and taste should see, I'll always love the original, but I was impressed with this one as well, it was alot different in the way the story was told with the people in the trailer and the different characters but thats what made it different and special from the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a remake of the classic original, which pretty much started the whole slasher film genre.. Obviously this film is not the groundbreaking type as the original version was, but it is still a fairly entertaining entry in the slasher sweepstakes. Jessica Biel of "7th Heaven" fame headlines here as one of a group of young people on a roadtrip (the other actors are mostly unknowns, though I did recognize Erica Leerhsen from the under rated "Blair Witch 2"). Of course things take a turn for the worse when they pick up a disturbed woman on the side of the road and then get stuck in some backwards town where they run into some unsavory individuals and a nasty chainsaw. Technical elements are top notch here, and the young cast is mostly game. Nothing new here, but the film works fairly well, at least until a rather unsatisfying ending that deviates from the original. GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Great Psychotic Maniac with the Chainsaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say, I saw The Texas Chainsaw Massacre on the day it came out and it was truly terrifying. There were so many surprises that made the WHOLE audience scream!! Leatherface is the greatest slasher in horror history! Listening to the chainsaw struck terror in my heart. Whenever Leatherface used the chainsaw, parts of my body went numb, mostly my legs! If you want the greatest re-make ever, this is definitely it!! Marcus Nispel did a fantastic job in directing this re-make. MUCH BETTER THAN THE 1ST ONE!!!! Job well done, Marcus! When it comes out on DVD, I'm getting my hands on it!! The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a great horror film that anybody will love. To be honest, watching this movie has caused me to be afraid of the dark. If you haven't seen it yet, hurry up right away! The theater was full, but I was grateful that I got a chance. This is a fantastic psychotic film. Leatherface has proved himself scary and insane. I love horror films and this may be the best one I've seen!! See it now!! I give this film a solid 10! Ths film is truly frightful and intense! Leatherface may have proven himself the most powerful killer in filmmaking. I hope he stars in a movie vs. Fred Krueger AND Jason Voorhees!! Only those three are the best!! Fred Krueger, Jason Voorhees, and Leatherface are the best killers in movie history!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A deep suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I watched this movie, I thought it would just be another violent gory slasher movie. As the movie raced on, I found myself deeply intrigued. The entire movie is non-stop suspense. I jumped several times. Really, there was a minimal amount of violence, most of which was offscreen. Plenty of language, though. I would watch this movie more than once, because there are so many details to catch. A great plot! The saws are good, but they don't have a plot, while this movie simply does. I also thought it was creepy how it is based on a true story. Don't be tricked, though, because the Texas Chainsaw Man was actually caught, and does not still roam the world. This movie is deeply disturbing, as it revolves around a family of cannibals. I would definitely say 15 is about the cut-off age for this movie. It's a must see in the dark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very, very good remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched the original film a few times before and watched it again last night or early this morning. I have also watched, for the first time,the sequel "Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2", today. I haven't finished TCM 2 but it is near the end. Anyway, as far as sequels and horror movies go, Texas Chainsaw Massacre "2003" edition, succeeds and excels in it's intention of capturing the shear(although pruning shears were not the weapon :-)terror of the original TCM.Having the "hottie" Jessica Biel in it is definitely a major plus, in my book!!!! But aside from her awesome looks, she can definitely act and is a good updated scream queen of a new generation. Also having R Lee Ermey is a major(I love unintentional puns since he was a former servant of our country)plus as well. kudos to the casting directors. All of the rest of the cast do well, but these stand out!!!! Rent it or buy this or any Halloween season.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is just about as great as the original one. The one scene I like a lot is when the girl blows the back of head of off. Another thing I like a lot is the new Leatherface seems more pi**ed off. Another great thing about this film is that it is as hard hitting as the original. No pulling punches here. My top scenes in the movie is the one mentioned. The one where Andy gets his leg chainsawed off at the knee then he gets hung on the meat hook. Basically any scene where people are getting brutally killed by Leatheface is good for me. R Lee Ermy as the sheriff is a great aspect to have in this great horror remake of the greatest movie in horror history The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tough no horror movie would top the original Taxas chainsaw massacre, but when i saw this, OMFG. Why it is so good. 1. The story is original. 2. Leatherface is really scary. 3. The cast is excellent.But there are one negative: Its too short. But if you haven't seen this, DO IT!!! 4.The sheriff is more intimidating than in the original. 5.The director has done an excellent job. 6. Its perfectly gore, its not too much and not too little. Its better than the original, I think. The cinematography is best yet in horror movie. They have add a new dimension In Leatherfaces character. And it is believable (unlike Jason vorhees, Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers) So if your looking after a bloody,disturbing horror movie this is the one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the remake of "The Texas chainsaw massacre" is so much better than the original! Sure, the first one might be a bit more "believable" like someone else already said, but this one is much more attention-grabbing. Five teens are driving when they see a girl walking by the side of the road. she seems scared out of her mind so they offer to give her a ride, but then she puts a gun in her mouth and kills herself. They were arguing about weather they should dump her body or call the police. When they decided to phone the sheriff, and he showed up, it was nothing like they expected. He was a mean, drunken old man who didn't know what he was doing. He started blaming them for killing the girl, and forces them to help him wrap her body up in a tarp. When the sheriff leaves, the teens decide to look for help. They find a house out in the middle of the forest. When they knock, an old man answers. He has no legs and moves around in a wheelchair carrying a gun. He does let them inside, and that was the first time they met the chain saw killer. I really liked this movie and so far it is one of my favourite horror films. I would definitely rate it a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>there is a serious negative bias in these reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>- any SPOILERS contained herein i do not consider to be so, but that is a matter of opinion, i guess. -having read a good deal of the reviews posted here, i find that there is a gross imbalance in representation of opinions about this film. i suspect that this may be due to the majority of reviewers having seen the original 30yrs ago, hence were opposed to the idea of a remake to begin with.i understand why the original is considered a masterpiece and saw it first because i respect the opinions of those who came before me and believe that one should have a basis for comparison in such cases as this (much the same way as reading the book before seeing the movie that was made from it). without a doubt, the original was a groundbreaking film which had resounding influence on future filmaking; but the original film is dead in the 21st century, having been left behind with the people of that day by the changing times. a father should want the best for his son and not wish to see his legacy taint the achievements of that son.in modern times, people desire a different kind of film. these days, the mind is touched much more visually than ever before, as exemplified by films such as 'saving private ryan' or 'passion of the christ'. people want to see these things and it may have something to do with the evolution of horror films over time. i see this remake as a tribute to the '74 classic. a son. a younger rendition of his father, with the same bushy eyebrows, glaring eyes and gapped teeth.one should not complain about supposedly bad acting or bad story lines, for neither is worse than the other in such respects. rarely does a horror film NOT have bad acting; and the characters always run inside, up stairs, trip over ladybugs, and die ridiculous, seemingly avoidable deaths. these things are standard issue no matter who is involved in the film...actors, producers, etc. that said, this remake is far better than the original but only because it was made with the original sitting nearby ('the lord of the rings' would have been a great disappointment had they not read the books thrice before hand and and twice during its making). using the '74 film as a guideline, the '03 film fixes and enhances many of the shortcomings therein; things that were necessary to do the film justice.there were sexy girls in the original version, only now they have bigger breasts. no horror film could be successful without sexy, bloodstained, and distressed women. the group has a much more viable reason for being in the area and, after picking up the distressed girl (why would anyone have picked up THAT hitch-hiker?!), and a better excuse for remaining there afterward. the casting job was wonderful. the added role of the sheriff (R. Lee Ermey) was a purely magnificent decision. the same goes for the women in the trailer and the dirty, crooked faced boy. all of them add tremendously to the aura of the town (the same aura emitted by the original film). the house, while perhaps unrealistic, looks to be a better fit to the film; and the rooms inside are much more creepy and disturbing. using the slaughter house was a nice added touch, for what better place for a scene than a bloody factory full of freshly killed meat? and nothing sends shivers down one's spine like a shot through the head, REALLY slow and agonizing deaths, or the look of leatherface wearing the boyfriend's face. and the cinematography captures it all beautifully.the fact is, this is the first movie i wanted to watch again once the credits started rolling since i saw 'children of the corn' when i was six. the possibility of reality made the original film great, and now that reality feels real indeed thanks to the accurate depiction of true insanity.the characters in the original were crazy, but i feel that the truly insane still have the ability to reason and may even act normal (hannibal leckter).all that family was missing was a bit of involuntary twitching. this horror film should be in the top five. it is painful and moving and chilling, just like 'private ryan' and 'passion' and 'silence of the lambs' and others. horror isn't only jump-out-of-your-seat thriller like 'friday the 13th' or 'nightmare on elmstreet', etc. it is also the depiction of evil as it actually exists in the mind without taking on physical form, like in 'donnie darko' or 'the exorcist' or 'children of the corn' even. personally, i believe jason and freddy are two of the least scarry because they are two of the most unbelievable characters ever created.this remake has characteristics of all the aforementioned films while not once is there any reason to believe that everything in it could not have actually occurred. and the documentary pieces had people i know wondering that very thing. nothing negative can be said about this film that cannot also be said about horror films that people who did not care for this film did care for. in other words, never listen to the opinions of others before you've made your own. being wholly respectful of the original, this film should be honored as a son baring the name of his adored father. i give it a 10 to fight the imbalance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent new makeover on an old idea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very few times is the remake of a so-called classic ever anything worth seeing. But THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE is one of the scariest horror films to come out in a while. The original film was boring and dull, but the 2003 remake is new, fresh, and awesome. THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE is about of group of travelers on their way to a concert who pick up a hitchhiker. The young hitchhiker looks all scratched up and seems scared out of her mind. In one of the most shocking scenes in the whole film (You have to see it to believe it). She leaves them stranded looking for someone to help them. With a town that seems very uninterested in what the group is telling them, they themselves set out to find the local sheriff (A low man in a high position). This sets in motion a rapid story with more jolts and screams then other recent horror films. THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE is by far a scare a minute film. It will leave you breathless and hanging on to your seat. The camera work in the film is good, its effect makes all of the scenes in part more scary looking. Leather face is scarier and meaner in the remake then he was in the original. The acting in the film isn't great, but in a movie like this the acting isn't supposed to be. If you thought the trailer looked good then go see this movie. All in all this film gets a B, 3.2 out of 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's just start off saying, I'm absolutly in love with the original, It's in my classic's list, and one of my favourite movie, I didn't have all the much hope in the remake... but it absolutly blew me away. I planned to go see Kill Bill, It was my 18th birthday, and October 16th. I get to the theatre to realize there is a 'premiere' going on from a radio station, I convinced them to let me and my boyfriend in, it being my b-day and all. I got some Sovenir's(Little Chainsaw, some 'Scary movie 3' toilet paper.) I don't want to give too much of the movie away. Jessica Biel was absolutly brillant, great actress. The movie was shocking( and not many movies do that, for me at least) It was exhilerating, and I was on the tip of my toes. The storyline was a bit more complex then that of the first. The ending was much more thought out. I give it a 10, I can't wait till the DVD comes out, and I think i'm going to see it again at the movies, it's very awesome.Best movie i've seen in years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an amazing remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TCM (texas chainsaw massacre) and the ring are the only truly brilliant horror remakes. This is so good that when I went to bed after it, I was too scared to get up for the toilet. Thus wetting the bed! Jessica Biel does her part really well and the supporting cast are freaky. The blood in this film would not be described as gore. I would imagine gore as a load of blood gushing out of someone. This is more of intense violence. And the scene where Biel is hiding in the closet made me sweat with fear. But perhaps the best scene is at the beginning where all the exhibits are being left on a table, It shows a hammer, broken nails and finally, A CHAINSAW.This is way above average for a remake (or a normal horror film at that) and you should see it as soon as you can..........if you dare!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gotta say I am a huge fan of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and when I heard that Andrew Bryniarski was going to play Leatherface in the new film, I had to see it. And was I surprised!!! Not since the original one, Gunnar Hansen, has Leatherface been played the way he should be played. The problem with the sequels of the past were that they were given too much emotions, such as love (part 2) and family (part 3 &amp; 4). Gunnar didn't show emotions like love and family...he did it with no remorse. Andrew took that no remorse and upped it to a 20!!! Without a doubt one of the best remakes of a classic horror film with the best Leatherface since the original!!! Let fans complain that the last name is not Sawyer...so what?! A fresh new version with a classic horror style thanks to the director and cinematographer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TCM 2003 is way better than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read almost all the comments posted on this site along with a few reviews (like the bad one by Roger Ebert) and I just can't understand : In my humble opinion, TCM 2003 is an incredible movie. There was a lot of hype regarding the original, but the firt TCM is...let's say it, boring. I saw it when I was 12 years old and despite the strange feeling of reality, there were few good moments. TCM 2003 is what an horror movie should be all about. No unjustified sex scenes ( althought it doesn't hurt my feelings that much :) ), no teen dialogs, only pure terror. When I watch the movie, I was unaware that the movie was pure fiction ( I read it afterward )...The movie grabbed me by the balls and disturbed me. That's what I am expecting from a good horror movie. I am a huge horror movie fan ( my all time fav is Evil Dead 2 ) and I think 2002-2003 brings us some really strong NEW type of horror movies ( Signs, The Ring, 28 days later, Jeepers Creepers, The Cabin were all good ). But TCM 2003 is simply the best stabbing movie I have seen since...I can't remember</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Horror Film in a Long Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I was walking to the theater door to see this earlier today, I kept thinking I was just going to witness another "Wrong Turn (2003)" But I saw exactly the opposite. This film is a lot better than the other horror films that came out this year. The direction in this movie was outstanding. It gives you a feel that you are actualy there but also delivers some very cool shots. The lighting and cinematography were also very well done.It has all the major ingredients that go into making of a good horror film. There was gore (which wasnt over done at all but there was still plenty), suspense (which I thought was almost unbearable at times), black humor (which really disturbed me and then made me feel sick for actually laughing at it)...I could go on but I wont.The acting was excellent! Jessica Biel done better than I had expected and hit all the high notes perfectly. At least she didn't only scream for the last hour of the movie. I enjoyed every minute she was on screen. R. Lee Ermey was excellent in this film. He actaully made me believe that he was a sicko and a few times I feared him more than Leatherface. I wish they could have showed more of his character (Dinner scene maybe?). The supporting cast was also outstanding.I do have a few complaints though. First, I didn't really enjoy the musical score all that much. I wish they had just used the one from the original. But granted the music was good to help scare you into some really disturbing scenes so I guess it was okay... Second, I miss the big escape from the end of the original. That ending gave you a sense that it could be the end of the survivor if he/she does the wrong thing. Don't get me wrong this one did too, but not like the original. The ending here had its cliched moments but was still thrilling and heart-stopping.But this was a wonderful horror film that I plan to see again soon! I'm glad this came out. I was getting ready to give up on the new Hollywood horror films. THE SAW IS FINALLY BROUGHT BACK TO LIFE!***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE BUZZ IS BACK!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a long time fan of the original I was quite skeptical going into this one. Especially since it was a first time director and Jessica Biehl was starring in it. However, those worries have been put aside upon returning from the opening show today of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It not only reimagines the entire first film but improves on it. The film is loaded with tension, suspense, very believable performances, taut direction and unbelievable jolts. The film however doesn't manage to retain the grittiness of the first and it seems more of a production but that makes it all the more enjoyable. There is one brutal murder after another as the film skyrockets to it's horrifying and relentless climax. Jessica biehl especially stands out in a performance that puts her 7th heaven days to rest. And this truly earns the title "texas Chainsaw Massacre" it packs a powerful punch and in a decade of almost meaningless horror franchises this film wreaks of true horror. The buzz is back!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IMPORTANT: Keep in mind this is a horror movie and I'm discussing its pros and cons relative to its genre.My impression about this movie it's that this is quite the best horror movie I've seen in the past 2 years. It's intense, very bloody and the stupid scenes are rare. I would say its grade is 10 if it wasn't for one of the teenagers who just refuse to die. Although heavily injured he just hangs on. I won't say more not wanting to spoil the plot. That kicks back the grade to 8. But again the script was very good and the shooting of the film shows experience and I really like Jessica Biel so I'll settle for a 9.If you want a serious horror movie with an interesting and complex development around a simple main idea and scenes that will keep you glued to the seat this is it. Also your girlfriend might get quite scared so she'll want you to hold her. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie amazed me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first when I saw the previews for the re-make of the Texas Chansaw Massacre I thought it was going to be just another crappy re-make. But after seeing it I found myself scared out of my mind. This film is in fact BETTER than the original. Even though the cliché ending in which at least one character gets away (too many horror movies end like this) I still enjoyed it immensely. Instead of polluting the movie with gore and cheap effects they made the setting almost real and very very very disturbing. And thank god they got the new Leatherface to stop grunting, that was one of my major annoyances of the first movie is you couldn't take it seriously because of all the pig-like noise the killer kept making. Instead of showing you all the atrocities Leatherface has committed (with the help of his family) you get to see strange and horrific elements that terrify your imagination as to what he had done. The basing it on a true story like in the 1st movie was better the 2nd time around because you actually felt like it WAS a true story. This was one of the scariest and terrifying movies I've seen in ages and if someone tells you its not worth seeing, don't take their word for it, GET IT YOURSELF! It is a must see for any fans of the TCM original and for horror buffs. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Massacre is and should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Five friends go on a roadtrip to Mexico to buy some drugs. There is the attractive Erin(Jessica Biel) who is probably the most mature one from her group, her boyfriend and driver Kemper(Eric Balfour), Erin's brother Morgan(Jonathan Tucker) who is a bit of a pain in the ass and enjoys getting stoned a lot and last but not least, couple Pepper(Erica Leerhsen) and Andy(Mike Voge) who can't seem to keep their hands off of each other. When they get into a gruesome incident with a hitchhiker, they are forced with a horrible encounter with Leatherface, the terrifying killer who wears masks made out of human skin and butchers everybody who comes close to him in the most horrible way possible. I was highly anticipating this movie, being a big fan of the original one. This remake was pretty good, definitely the best horror of the year so far. It gave me a few jumps and the acting was great. The one thing that I did not like was that so many things were different compared to the original. Too many characters were added, people were getting killed way to fast and some of the most important and best parts from the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie were missing here. However, that still didn't keep it from being a gory massacre and a decent horror. Sure, it wasn't as good as the original but what remake ever is? I would give The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very bold and intense horror and a great DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I fully appreciate and respect the tastes of others, let me just say I have no idea why the original is held in such high regard. It was truly one of the worst films I have ever seen. Nothing happened in it. There was ZERO suspense or excitement, the dialogue was barely audible and it felt like another half of it was missing. I hated it and I am so puzzled why so many people love that film.Granted, back in 1973 it may have been easier to scare audiences and the low-budget nature of the original may have contributed to the ugly look of the film but I see no reason to credit the original director (Tobe Hooper) with any of the film's so-called qualities. The man's career fell flat on it's face soon after and I think his most famous movie was something of a fluke. It would not have succeeded today. Obviously, as I just said, audiences today are exposed to a larger number of movies and can choose and discriminate more easily. There are some who will say the only people who can enjoy this will be degenerate teenagers who don't know what real horror is. And some who will call the film to glossy. But none of this I find fair criticism.I am, in no way, a fan of Michael Bay or any of his movies. But he had the right idea in keeping the budget very low for this movie ($8 million) and seems to be more skilled in packaging and producing than directing. The film is not 'glossy' or 'clean'. The equipment use to make the film is more sophisticated than that on the original but this is not 'The Rock' or 'Armageddon' and there are no hundred-shots-in-a-second and flashy camera tricks. They all tried their best to pull of a nervous, raw horror film that stands on it's own and I think they have.This was sooooooo much better than the first. The characters actually HAVE character this time. I got on their side, I got involved in the action (yes, there is action this time, and a LOT of it) and the acting was done well. Plus Jessica Biel is VERY hot.So many new dimensions and situations occur is this remake that elevates to something a zillion times what the original was. Don't automatically think that because Michael Bay is the producer that it's going to be some kind of sanitised and fashion-shoot Hollywood production. It is still a very edgy and intense film. It's rare that a Hollywood film manages to horrify and offend these days, so I'm very glad the new TCM went for a hard R-rating. The tone is so filthy and depraved that you will definitely need to shower soon afterwards. THAT'S how close you get to the action.Even the character of Thomas 'Leatherface' Hewitt has a lot more to do this time. He's not quite Jason Voorhees but he's still an incredibly mean bad guy you'd NEVER want to mess with or come within 10 miles of. And in case you're wondering, he's played by the same dude who played Butterfinger, the big, dumb blonde guy from Hudson Hawk. Only this time he's not so cuddly.Not since 8mm almost 5 years ago have I seen a film where the bad guys (there's more than one) are nothing but the blackest of all evil. R. Lee Ermey was terrific (as usual) as the disgusting Sheriff and any fans of him should only expect the most badass of performances.Second to Dawn of the Dead (and tying with House of 1000 Corpses) this is one of the best horror movies I have seen in a long time.The Platinum Series DVD is just awesome. The 1.85:1 anamorphic picture is superb and the Dolby 6.1/DTS ES soundtracks are incredible. You'll really think Leatherface is chainsawing his way into YOUR living room. There are also a massive load of interesting extras including a 75-minute documentary, deleted scenes, a documentary on serial killer Ed Gein (who was 'supposedly the inspiration for the original but Tobe Hooper denied these rumors) and screen test footage. The packaging is awesome with a metal plate stuck on the front cover and 'crime scene' photos in a little envelope tucked into back. It completes a great package of a great DVD of a great movie. Buy it!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie and don't quite understand people and their negative reviews. "This is so horrible, doesn't compare to the original at all." That's because this film was made another 30 years later.. Of course this movie is nothing like the original, no one wants to see the same thing over again. This movie brought a different approach to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre series and I really enjoyed the change. I am a fan of the 1974 original but I enjoy this remake just as much, it gives a different perspective on the character of Leatherface and the way he was brought up in his family. With obviously a higher budget to work on, this film displays a solid selection of special effects and gruesome scenes. The gore isn't too extreme though and this is probably the reason I didn't reward the movie with a 10 star rating. In saying that, this is a violent film and isn't for the faint hearted. Much more gruesome than any of the older films in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre series. If you enjoy this film like me I strongly suggest you see the next film in the series titled "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning." This prequel demonstrates to the audience how Leatherface became who he is and what came before the 2003 film.Thanks for reading. Leatherface rocks.

		<shortDescription>Very Entertaining but not anything Astounding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really don't know if what I am saying is a spoiler, so read at your own risk! This movie was very entertaining and scary, but it wasn't very mind-blowing. It has great action and a good plot, but it doesn't have that disgusting, stomach-upsetting gore effect or that eerie feeling that Leatherface is always behind you, waiting to turn on his infamous chainsaw. It could have been a lot better, but then again, it could have been a lot worse. Over all, the entertainment level was pretty good.Although this movie was pretty good, I've heard (but haven't seen) that the original 1974 movie did have that chilling after-effect on the viewer. I'm glad I saw this one first, though, because I might have been really disappointed if the other one was a lot better...Another issue I must explain is that this is not based on a specific true story! There was no real chainsaw involved, and the story of the five teens wasn't true at all. The real story was about Ed Gein, who has inspired many other movies, including Psycho. Ed Gein was a woman-obsessed serial killer (he used bullets, not a chainsaw) and grave robber from a rural town in Wisconsin who was admitted to a mental hospital after pleading guilty to his crimes. What was true, though, was that Gein did collect the body parts of his victims and sometimes made masks, clothing, and even furniture out of them. He also kept the bodies (he might have also hung them, but this might not be true) as did Leatherface in the movie. Just thought I'd get the story straight for the viewers who want to know! Anyway, this movie was over all pretty good, and I'd recommend it to any horror movie fan.</fullReview>

Mike Vogel is awesome, if you know his other work. None of the actors do a bad job and at the very least... you'll not be bored! That's for damn sure. If you are, I'll personally reimburse you. This is definitely not like the Psycho remake, BRIEF PSYCHO SPOILER, which is that it was verbatim except Marion Crane steals $400k instead of $40k and for a masturbation scene, END SPOILER. Jessica Biel is AWESOME in this movie, she is better than the original 1974 lead because she doesn't just scream throughout but believably cries throughout. One unnecessary aspect, however, is the gore. But, thats what this one and the original were all about (don't waste your time considering any of the other TCM movies, not even the one with Matthew McConaughy and Renee Zellwegger, it suuuuucked)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" was a shocking, raw, disturbing and extremely controversial horror film that would change the horror genre forever. Over the years since it's come out, I've argued with myself whether or not the remake is better. And I've finally decided that neither is better because they're completely two different films.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre obviously carries on some elements from the original, but really it's just the basic plot line. Apart from that, it has a completely different take on the story. The original was more realistic and involving with the audience. The grainy, simplistic way it was shot made it seem more like a nightmare than an actual horror film. But this remake is vastly different in it's portrayal, with it's beautiful glossy cinematography and more fictional quality. It just seems more like a very scary horror movie experience than an actual event like the original.There are many pleasant surprises in this horror film, which outranks in my opinion almost all of the other recent remakes, and it's following prequel "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning" which just failed to hit the mark. Five similar teens as in the original are traveling across the barren wasteland that is the backwoods of Texas, and on the way they pick up a hysterical hitchhiker who promptly murders herself in front of them, so beginning a dreadfully scary descent into madness when the friends come across the Hewitt family, home of the legendary chainsaw wielding Leatherface. In this film, he's arguably more brutal, as is the whole film, more so than the original which is also a huge contrast.The biggest surprise in the movie is Jessica Biel, who you just cant help but fall in love with as she gives a tremendously strong "final girl" performance and really kicks ass at the end. Another very pleasant surprise is Erica Leerhsen, coming out of that crap "Blair Witch 2" as the typical panicky girl who slows everyone down. But she gives the character Pepper a charming, carefree personality.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a fast, often terrifying and ultimately extremely satisfying take on the original that is sure to please at least to some extent even the die hard fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Ihe only thing that wasn't done so well was the way the story about leather face's family was revealed and the whole history behind the murders. Personally, i think it took too long into the movie before it was revealed and that confuses viewers trying to figure out and connect the story to the actions happening. I also don't understand why they would choose to make the second girl of the group of five kids a hitchhiker; pepper or whatever her name was. Not a big deal really, doesn't do much to the movie, I just always wondered. As far as horror movies go, it was pretty good in being gory and the idea of a chainsaw murderer was semi unique. The only thing that seemed a bit much was hanging the one guy on the meat hook while he was still alive and having his friend have to stab and kill him, that seemed a bit much to me. Pretty good movie though, I say 8/10.</fullReview>

Lee Ermy is funny and intimidating. The storyline is OK. The characters are pretty likable. Be warned it has a lot of jump scenes. If you liked the original you will like this one.

But the other characters are great. Jebidiah's annoying though.Characters(*bad): Leather face is creepy but my real favorites are old Monty (creepy) and Sheriff Hoyot. Hoyot was an ingenious character.Story: A little stereotypical, a group of teens on their way to a concert are picked off one by one.Scares: Loads of great scenes that had me freaking out (i'm not going to tell you any of them though) Overall: TCM is a good movie with good characters, 7.1/10 plot, great scares, great villains, good creepy kills, sad moments, and a great box.Definitely worth the $5 at blockbuster.9/10 * by good i mean not evil * i don't mean bad as in they're lousy i mean bad as in evil</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pretty good remake. The first ten minutes are excellent - characters well established, and a nice see-through on the suicide's bullet hole. The nasty sheriff is good, and the heroine plays it well throughout. A basic problem is that this - like the original - is full immersion horror, and it's tricky to come up with a believable escape. After a fairly routine chase sequence, they give us an effective deception: the heroine hotwires a vehicle, but not the one you expect. Apart from that, there was a poorly judged scene, where the heroine had the opportunity to pick up the chainsaw, but instead just pummelled Leatherface with her soft little hands. And no nipple-action in the freezer?! And there's no memorable line. So just pretty good. It might have been improved if the rescued kid had turned out to be one of the clan as well - maybe the heroine could have tousled his hair as she drives away, and his little face comes off in her hand ... Junior Leatherface ... and she crashes and dies. Buh-wah-ha-ha!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mass murder taking place in Texas.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me preface this by saying that many people believe this is based on a true story of a chainsaw massacre in Texas where the perpetrators were never apprehended. According to snopes this is incorrect. Of course when amity ville horror first came out they said it was based on a true story which is bunk. However spreading those kind of rumors sure made money at the box office. According to snopes the producers got the idea from Ed Gein, and the director Tobe Hooper looking over a chainsaw display in a hardware store. http://www.snopes.com/movies/films/chainsaw.asp.It was about 5 travelers that picked up a hitchhiking girl and found out they were in over their head. There was plenty of action and screaming as is in most slasher films. It was quite different in some aspects from the original 1974 movie by the same name. The acting was actually not bad. It was not as bloody as it could have been. Don't get me wrong it was gory but not as bad as it could have been. If gore is not for you neither is this film. The special effects were pretty good and the plot was OK. The writing was excellent in my opinion. I do always wonder why in horror flicks people always run to places that are dead ends or otherwise hard to escape from. On a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being poor and 5 being excellent I would rate this movie a 3 1/2 to 4.</fullReview>

I'm sure lots of you like me can still see his mug in your head well after the movie's finished. I originally saw this one in the theatres and again recently on DVD and its still got its shocks and gore value. SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT: But the ending with the fictional footage of the police documenting the basement then out of nowhere getting attacked by Leatherface while the camera's still rolling will definitely make you scream (one of the best ending since blair witch)!! END OF SPOILER Note: If you look at actor Andrew Bryniarski's credits (Leatherface / Thomas Hewitt) in 1992 he was Christopher Walken's son, Chip Shreck who gets smacked by Penguin in Batman Returns. lol.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd kinda like to pretend that I don't care about the whole remake debate and not say anything, but I *do* care and I do have something to say, so I guess I'll enter the fray anyway. The most important thing I have to say to those complaining about them is, if you love these classics so much, why the hell don't you want anyone to see them? Though it certainly isn't anything too major, remakes do generate interest in the original film. The fact is, I'm quite certain that the vast majority of the people who saw this movie hadn't seen the original, and a very substantial portion of them probably had never even heard of it. And most of them probably went away from the theater and never gave any of it a second thought, but there are those who saw this, then saw the original, and maybe got seriously interested in underground horror, many of whom may have never gotten into it without films like this. A big-time remake is about the best publicity that a 30 year old film could hope for. So I say keep 'em coming. Make the 'Suspiria' remake. Sure, it'll suck, but it'll create some low-key interest in one of the greatest horror films of all time. And that is not tainting a films legacy, that's adding to it by introducing it to a new audience, even if most of them won't take to it. All right, now to the main stuff.Though it diverges massively in the overall execution, the basic setup of this film is basically the same as in the original: 5 youths, though not teens, thankfully, end up stranded in rural Texas, and must fight for their lives against a murderous family. First, the positive things. The acting amongst the 5 young protagonists is generally capable, though they generally aren't expected to do much. Though not all these characters are precisely 'likable', I don't hate or dislike any of them either. For some reason, I've felt an intense, irrational hatred of most of the 'hot young stars' that emerged in the mid-late 90's, who always starred in this sorta thing. Fortunately, that group has grown up and moved on, and the new cadre of victims is far less loathsome. The Hewitts are pretty decent too, though they occasionally lapse into unintentional self-parody. (The kid with the incredibly phony buck teeth is particularly obnoxious) Leatherface himself is quite good, though, again, there isn't all that much to that role. He looks great, except in the one shot where we get to see him without his mask, head-on, which is unfortunate because he looks disturbingly reminiscent of Wayne Static. (Though this shot is preceded by a really cool one, of him standing in a cloud of down blowing about him after he sliced through the parka of another victim. Totally reminds of the fine Italian slasher film, 'Stagefright. But anyway...) The only other major role is R. Lee Ermey as the sadistic 'sheriff' who turns out to be a Hewitt. (That ain't a spoiler, as it's obvious that he's a nut from the outset.) Ermey plays his same basic character, but with the humor cut down quite a bit, though not gone, and the menace increased. I thought he would prove disastrous, but he's alright. His scenes don't work entirely, but if it had been nothing but Leatherface itta been to one-dimensional, so I guess he works for the film as a whole.More significantly, this film has great visual style and atmosphere. The set design is magnificent, though some of it is a bit clichéd now, what with the grimy organic-industrial lair that Leatherface inhabits. The upper floors are much more modeled after the original house, and it works very nicely, with the rotting flesh and filth and bizarre trinkets. The outdoor setting are really quite stunning, picturesque and menacing simultaneously. The forest between the road and the Hewitt house is especially nice, beautifully lit with spears of light floating through the trees in haunting patterns. Though virtually every negative review loves to mention how Nispel is a music-video director, most of the camera-work and editing is fairly controlled and calm. (I love how being a music-video director automatically makes you a hack, apparently. Tell that to Spike Jones and David Fincher. Sure, most of them are hacks, but so are most of the directors who didn't start on MTV.) It does get a bit frenzied at times, but never so much so that you can't tell what's going on. And, it lacks the most obnoxious of all modern trends, the wiggle cam. (i.e. hand-held camera operated by a drunkard who thinks that the zoom is the most fascinating damn thing in the world.) The actual horror scenes are perhaps not particularly intriguingly staged, but the overall visual strength of the film makes these scenes quite interesting. The first death (by Leatherface) would have to be the best one. It's reasonably closely modeled after the opening death in the original, and while it lacks the brutal, stunning nature of that scene, it's still more intense than what you'd usually see in a major film. Contrary to what so many will tell you, this film really isn't all that gory. Basically, you see a bullet to the head, a leg sawed off and an arm hacked off. Other than that you've basically just got atmospheric gore, i.e. icky stuff laying around. Frankly, I didn't find this film at all scary, but I've never been much interested in being scared by a horror movie. I just like the mood and lighting and atmosphere, and yeah, gore of good horror films, and it's got that. So I like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first learned they were remaking "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" I was very skeptical. Why remake a movie that was already excellent? Would it be a cheesy rip-off, or would it honor the original? Still, I was very excited to see this movie on opening night. Some people I know simply refused to see this movie out of loyalty to the original. But I recommend to all who have not seen this, CHECK OUT THIS FILM. It was the first movie in a long to actually scare me in the theatre. There are many elements of the original preserved, such as teens in a van in a small town in Texas. But many things are creatively changed, without ruining the movie at all. It isn't too long into the movie before you find yourself longing for the grand appearance of the chainsaw. And it comes at exactly the right time. The Hewitt family isn't just sick and deranged, in this movie they are genuinely disturbing. All the main points from the original film are present, and the entire movie has a dark feel to it. In fact special filters were used on the cameras to make the scenes more dusty looking, to capture the feeling of isolation you would have if you were in the middle of nowhere in Texas. No matter how much you love the original, give the 2003 making of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" a chance. It's a great horror film.</fullReview>

It fills my needs in a horror movie; blood, guts, a crazy man killing people for no good reason, more blood, how could it get any better than that? What makes the movie more interesting is that it is based on actual events, so it has a creepier feeling to it, especially when you see the actual police footage. Now, I've seen the original, which I'm sure was scary when it first came out, but this newer Texas Chainsaw did one better; it almost was believable. I mean, I would act the same way if put in that kind of situation. All in all, I totally recommend this movie to any body looking for a good scare, but be warned, it's not for the faint of heart- or for anybody who doesn't like gruesome, dark movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sure Tobe Hooper's great "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" didn't need to be remade but if it had to be the remake couldn't get any better than this one.This is a very good remake of an all time classic.A van load of dope smoking young folks set off to see a Skynard concert when a freaky female hitchhiker upsets their plans.After picking her up they soon learn that they have made a very big mistake.This is a very gory and bloody and quite graphic film.What the original only hinted at this one shows.Limbs are hacked off and the torture is gruesome.While this one doesn't have the impact of the original, it is quite good at being simply scary.The chase scene through the slaughterhouse near the end of the film is a most excellent bit of film-making. R.Lee Ermey,yeah the guy from "Mail Call" and about a thousand military movies,including "Full Metal Jacket" is absolutely awesome as the insane sheriff.This movie is slicker and more expensively made than the original, of course, and while it doesn't achieve the greatness of the original it is a very good film all on it's own.See the original first,by all means,if you haven't and then see this one.This remake is perhaps the second best horror remake I've ever seen,second only to the remake of "Dawn of the Dead".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I have to say that I loved how they went in an urban legend direction with this remake. All of Tobe Hooper's essential elements are still there. A van, a stranger on the side of the road. Some sort of violence in the van, a stop at a gas station. A group of people. This really was a refreshing way to retell the story. I recall the first time I'd heard of the movie, sometime in the 80's (I was born in 74) and how they story I was told was not the same as the movie. It's easy to see how this version could have been an urban legend, where the story changes, but the essentials are still there. If you don't believe me, watch them both, back to back. One of the few remakes that I felt superseded the original, no offense to Tobe Hooper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my opinion- way better than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I originally did not like this movie that much, but then I watched the old one and just loved the remake. For one thing, it was scarier. The 1974 version was way too slow for me and this one was packed with excitement and killings just like it should. I mean, the title is The Texas Chainsaw MASSACRE! I loved the creepy Unsolved Mysteries thing they did at the beginning and end. The first was said to be disturbing and horrifying but was not, but this one had a guy who got his leg cut off with a chainsaw, and another guy getting a chainsaw to his crotch (for those who read spoilers without seeing the movie, they don't show the chainsaw actually hitting his...well you know). No offense to Tobe Hooper, I know he was trying to make it PG but come on, if it's got a title like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre you gotta go all out. So before leaving I want to say thanks to everyone who helped make this remake and helped TCM live up to its name.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one,two Leatherface is coming for you...........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of teenage friends pick up a hitchhiker and she commits suicide in the back of their van.They stop in a small out of the way town to report the death and meet Leatherface and his weird family. I have seen the original movie and to be honest I didn't think it was that good.The remake however has got to be one of the scariest and most disturbing horror films that i have seen in the last ten years and believe me I have seen some pretty disturbing films. From the moment they meet the strange necrophiliac sheriff who likes to grope dead female corpses you realise that you are about to enter a horror film like no other. The film has too many great moments for me to name them all but my favourite bit was when Erin saw Leatherface wearing her boyfriends face as a mask. This movie is very gruesome and from the first time we saw Leatherface putting Kemper on the meat hook I found i could not stop shaking. Some of the scenes were so disturbing that I took off my glasses to watch so i couldn't really see what was going on. I don't think i will watch this movie again in a hurry but it is the sort of film that will stay with you long after you have seen it.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine remake, an even better thriller....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good remake and even better horror film. I would actually classify this film as more of a thriller than horror, but as a remake of Tobe Hooper's 1974 horror classic, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, is one of the best horror/thriller films. The acting is quite good to my surprise. Jessica Beil does a fine job as the lead in the film, although I don't quite understand why critics have bashed her performance here as there is really nothing wrong with it. Andrew Bryniarski does a brilliant job of portraying Thomas Hewitt, the man they call... Leatherface. He's got all the great qualities of a complete psychopath armed with a chainsaw. Personally, I enjoyed this remake more than the original and I think both will withstand the test of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most gory crap I've seen in years. When an old man told me and my friend what the Texas Chainsaw Massacre was about, I was frozen. The farmer decides to feed his pigs human flesh. To save money? I don't know. I see pigs wallow in the mud sometimes. I guess I know why now. Jessica Biel is drop-dead hot in this flick. And seeing the flesh hanging from a severed leg after being cut by a chainsaw is even more appalling. The tension is crafted with the special effects of computerized advancement. From traveling through a bullet-hole in the forehead, to grinding salt on open flesh for taste, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is indeed a landmark in documentary entertainment. You have the new and the old in this film. Considering the former version was banned in several countries, I'd watch it because it's illegal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Remake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I approached the TCM remake with a mixture of trepidation and excitement. I was nervous that the film would be garbage, besides...why try to do a remake of such a perfect film anyway? And I was also excited that we might see a revival of strong, serious, "exploitation"-style horror in the U.S. again. But either way, I didn't have my hopes up too high. I understand the U.S. horror market, and our new outlook seems to be to rape and pillage everything that is original from either other countries, or our own classic film catalog.Anyway TCM: the remake was a relatively decent attempt. The beginning was a pretty cool twist on the original, and all-in-all the film was entertaining. Some decent gore and acting, and a pretty good all around atmosphere. That being said, I also had some problems with the film. I'll leave out the whole rant that TCM shouldn't have been remade in the first place...we all know that already. My main problems with the remake were in 2 main areas...1st off: the slick production values and much higher budget ruined the whole grimy, grainy effect that made the original so powerful in the first place. My other big issue was the decision to try to "humanize" Leatherface by trying to explain the reasoning behind the human-skin mask. In the original, He wore human skin on his face 'cuz he was a f'cking psycho!!! That's it! And to me, that's far more scary than trying to put a spin to the story where we're supposed to empathize with or pity this lunatic.Overall, TCM: The Remake, is definitely worth a look. It could have been much worse, at least it seemed like those involved tried to do some justice to the original... 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a fan of Wrong Turn, I know what you did last summer, Scream, and any other recent horror films-I thought this movie was an intense nail-bitting horror film. (I couldn't get over how much Jessica Biel looked like Eliza Dushku. Yes, It bothered me throughout the whole movie.) Being the kind of person I am I HATE GORE. The less gore the better, and yes, I do believe that there was some scenes that were a little unnesceray.(Did I spell that write.Lol) Anyways, If you are into watching a movie that will keep your eyes glued to the screen even though you already know who will die and who will live within the first 5 min.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good horror movie but..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good horror movie but it does not follow the real life of Ed Gein.Because1)The real Texas chainsaw massacre never used a chainsaw, he used a 32 caliber to kill his victim and a knife to take the skin of then.2)In the movie he had a family, a mother, a brother etc.. But in real life his whole family died before 1945.3)In the movie The Texas chainsaw massacre killed whoever he see's but in real life Ed Gein only killed females over 50 years old.Why??Because he mother was over 50 years old and he did not like her.4)In the movie he had a his father to help him kill the victim but in real life he had a friend but in went in prison a short while after he started killing in 1950.5)In the movie the sheriff was on his side.But him real life the cops were not on his team there were trying to get prove to put him behind bars.6)In the movie where did he learn to take the skin of his victims??Nowhere but in real life he read lots of book about the human body.If you like horror films watch this one but if you want to learn about the life of Ed Gein avoid this film and read about him and this film should not have been inspired by a true story.7 out of 10 for a good horror movie not for the life of Ed Gein.

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this remake. It is one of the best. It is a true story about 5 friends who encountered a family of Cannibals and had a couple days of hell. This takes place in August of 1973. 5 friends are traveling down the road to a concert when Erin(Jessica Biel) spots a hitchhiker and they almost hit her. Just a few minutes after they pick her up she complains saying' you can't make me go back.." " he's a bad man" then she kills herself..that's when they travel down the road to hell where they encounter a man with a face deformity, who's name is Leatherface, who wields a deadly chainsaw. I give this movie a 9 because it was wonderfully portrayed by each actor/actress and i also gave it a 9 because it is a true story and it is played so well by each person!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disclaimer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nispel's remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is about as gory and disturbing as a mainstream film can be without losing its audience. It is a cynical, frightening dive into a nightmare which continues to spiral downwards farther and farther beyond any idea of hope. That's its trick. All horror movies have one.Any horror film with any degree of quality knows it must get to you on a level deeper than simply waiting for pop-outs. Carpenter's "Halloween" and Scott's "Alien" used fascination, developing a mythical status around their villains. Zemeckis' "What Lies Beneath" used patience, teasing you inch by inch with its ghost until you were begging it to come out yet screaming for it not to.This movie's gimmick is submission. It completely submits to the evil its depicting, relentlessly gorging on it in a way that "Scream" and "Evil Dead" never did, or perhaps even the original. Nispel behaves like an older brother getting carried away in a scary story, telling it with too much detail and screaming it at you after you cried "uncle." There is no surrender. There is no turning back. Is that a good thing? Is that healthy? I'm not sure. I am sure, however, that I would not want to stand before God and explain why I made this film. There's not much I could say.All of that said, the film should be commended for its beautiful cinematography (almost ironic given the proceedings), its stellar use of fear, and its occasional attempts to give its characters real levels. There is certainly a tremendous amount of craft in this movie, it is a seamless piece of terror.I often think of Fincher's "Seven" while watching this. That film also contained grotesque and macabre acts of evil, yet I realize in watching this that "Seven" did not abandon itself to these acts, but wanted to bring them forward in order to cleanse them from the hearts of the characters. Fincher was as shocked as you were. Nispel's film seems to want to reach out of the screen and hurt you.See it if you like. A genuine scare is not common in film, and horror movies rarely keep all their potency down the line. But be warned that you are responsible for the things you put in your mind, and they will come back for you. If that doesn't bother you, go for it.Otherwise...have a second thought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad re-make</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, when i saw the trailer for the movie, i though "hey cool", it was a very good trailer. Out of the 5 main characters, the real recognizable one would be Jessica Biel. You don't really know the other 4.. So, going to a rock concert in the 70's doin' drugs, and trippin' out, boy are these 5 friends about to seriously tripp out. The tripping out begins when they pick up the hitchhiker and she tells them that they are all gonna die right before she blows her face off with a gun. (good effects). They head to find the sheriff and find a sick little conveniences store that will make people sick, i can imagine the smell of it inside... In order of their demise: I'm so glad that Kemper bit it first, he might have been the leader of the group but deserved to croak right away..he was too into himself and stuck up. But it was kinda cheesy to see when Leatherface had Kempers face on when he killed Pepper. The most gruesome death scene had to be when Andy bit it. First he's being chased by Leatherface then he gets half of his leg sawed off, then hung by a hook in his back then the worst I think is when Leatherface put the salt or whatever of his cut up limb. Way gross!! A great scene in the movie was when the sheriff had Morgan in the van yelling at him talking crap to him and smashes his face with a bottle! Well acted! And yah, Morgans death was not as painful as Andy's but still being cut up from the bottom up, not a pleasant way to go and since he is Erin's brother, I feel for her seeing that. It's really awkward how this family of freeks are the only people you ever really see in the town. Kinda gloomy little town with no one around makes the movie even a little more out there. 10 stars I have to say go to R.Lee Ermy's sheriff Hoyt's character. He always kinda plays those kinda roles, but this role he totally made it real. He should have been nominated for an Academy Award for that role. All in all an OK movie, it kinda dragged on a little long at the end and Erin's character should have at least been cut or knocked out or something by Leatherface. That woulda been cool. Since she is the only survivor out of her and her 4 friends you have to give her some props for staying grounded in all that tripping out she did. I own the movie. Pretty good!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very impressive remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first; I think I may have enjoyed this better than the original mainly because this remake was more...entertaining. Don't get me wrong, there's a reason why the original is a classic but it what wasn't I'd call entertainment. Disturbing? yes. Violent? sure. Scary? yep but entertaining? Not really. maybe because it was too disturbing (or maybe because Marilyn Burn's continuous screaming throughout got the better of me). All in all, the original just made me feel queasy somehow. In this 2003 remake, not only is it more entertaining, but Jessica Biel makes a far better heroine than Marilyn Burns. The visuals are dazzling and fabulously gritty and the acting is actually rather good. What's best about it is how unexpected the first killing is(more to do with the fact that Eric Balfour gets it first and not Pepper or that guy she's sucking face with at the start of the movie). you don't expect the heroine's boyfriend to be killed off until at least the end where he would probably sacrifice his life to ensure his girlfriends' escape. But nope. He's killed within minutes of entering the slaughter house and becomes Victim No.1.And now to the scares. Thankfully, the film mostly strays away from cheap scares and decides to offer scares (ie the moment that Erin realises that Eric Balfour is no more when she sees his face skin stapled on Leatherface)that are more horrifying than eg somebody in the background running about. The death of the hitch hiker is another jolt of a moment because it's just not expected (Also the parallells between said girl's behaviour at the start and Erin's behaviour at the end is great). It's a saddening moment when Erin discovers that the trailer where the girl lived is now occupied by cannibals who also stole her baby. Also, when Andy (who's hanging on a hook) asks Erin to just kill him.By the end, I felt really sorry for the victims and glad that Erin managed to escape (it was a nice touch that she took the girl's baby with her instead of leaving the child with the cannibals that damaged the girl permanently leading to her suicide at the beginning of the film. The only offputting thing is the fake 'police walkthrough' of the slaughterhouse that plays at the start and end of the film. Mind you, on first viewing, I believed it.Overall, it's a (very) impressive remake and one of the best horrors of 2003. Go see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie advertised, I didn't really understand why they were making another movie on this. The original was really good, and with the horrible sequels that followed, I thought that this series was over and done with. With nothing else to rent, I rented this film and watched it. And I was surprised. Now, there is a TON of gore in this, and the beginning starts with some teens making out, and I thought "oh great, another typical slasher film". But the movie really pans out well. Leatherface is not seen much during half the movie, but when he does come, its a blast!! You will probably think its more scary than it is. I was covering my ears, only on the suspense. Scares are limited, but the action is high. *SPOILER*My only problem is that there are 5 teens, 3 boys and 2 girls. 1 of the girls is the heroine, and we learn a lot about her. Thats it. The other 4 are in the movie like 2 minutes each in total. So when they do die, you don't care because you really haven't connected with them at all. You could tell from the start who was going to live and who was going to die. But still, a really good movie, and for a movie made in 2003, it really felt like an old movie. Very good atmosphere. Overall, I give it an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT THE LOAD OF **** THAT YOU MIGHT THINK...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having only just watched the 2003 remake, I was very pleasantly surprised. Granted, it lacks the claustrophobic feeling and the documentary-style filming of Tobe Hoopers original, but I genuinely think that if Hooper had made the film today, it would look like this one!There is an attempt to re-create the documentary feeling at the beginning and the end of the remake, but this is secondary. Hoopers original had some genuinely terrifying moments, but over the duration of the running time, the original went more for hard shocks than continued suspense. The "re-imagining" (as this version prefers to be called) has fewer genuinely scary moments, but keeps the suspense up almost from the start.One bonus that the original never had was a bit more info into Leatherface and his motives (or lack of...) PLUS we get to see - albeit briefly - his real face. Ok, so the cannibalism was left out, but then again, this isnt a carbon copy. It's a re-telling of a good scary story. And its a pretty damn good retelling.One last thing; if the thought of Leatherface is too much for you, just remember that in this version, he is played by Andrew Bryniarski. Not sound familiar? Well, perhaps you remember him as the incompetent agent Butterfinger in Hudson Hawk! Suddenly, he doesnt seem so threatening, does he? Kinda like finding out Marilyn Mansons' real name is Brian Warner...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SOME SPOILERS Let me get one thing straight from the off - I LOVE the original TCM - it has long been in my top ten movies of all time - its one of those fluke movies that come along where everything - the low budget, the inept performers, maybe even the inept director (cf.pretty much everything Tobe Hooper has done since)came together and created something that was WAY more than the sum of its parts. So when I heard about a TCM remake - i thought Why Bother? Whats the point? I ain't paying to see that, you idiots. No details, but I saw it for free and you know what, I was impressed - not by anything specific - just that it wasn't half bad - in fact it was pretty good by the standard of mainstream 90s/00s US horror cinema - the fact that I was impressed that it wasnt bad tells you all about my opinion of 90s/00s mainstream horror cinema. Why? It took itself seriously, it didnt hold back on the gore and didnt use the gore for comic effect and it at least made an effort to recreate the bizarre, unexplainable atmosphere of the original. Its plus points are its opening half hour which is eerily effective (SPOILER - although the shot where the camera pulled back through the suicide girls headwound was a little too showy) - the production design (spot the camper van from the original in the grounds? hey remake or pseudo sequel?), the very gorgeous Jessica Biel and the fact that Leatherface actually wears her boyfriends face while he's chasing her. Its minus points - WTF was the point of Harry Knowles's head - way too much! The aforementioned SPOILER suicide girl headwound shot, the Blair Witch homage is clunky and overdone and the whole movie really loses its way during the overlong chase sequence in the last half hour - although it was nice of the director to ensure that Jessica's already tight vest also got very wet. All that said - by my reckoning the good outweighs the bad and I'll take this over Freddy vs Jason vs Dracula vs The Shape vs Godzilla anyday. A for effort C+ for execution.</fullReview>

I've never had an adrenaline rush that intense in a movie theatre before-this movie is not gory or horrific to the point in which they have to show you what is going on, this movie makes you think, and gives away nothing, unless you've seen the original, of course. But if you're in for a good thriller, then see this movie, and turn you're amp up as loud as it goes, as this movie starts slow then throws you back into you're seat. This movie is not a horror as much as it is just an amazingly shocking story, and is among one of the most disturbing things I've ever seen. This movie makes you believe you're at the scene the whole time, and this is the only movie where I've actually been thinking of ways in my head to seriously get out of the situation. Other movies, you are talking to the screen about where the killer is, but this one is like you're the character. If I had to be in a situation from a movie, this would be the last one I'd choose. Once again, I'll just say how amazing it is how this film pulls you into it as if you're a character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good scary film and worth seeing if you like lots of blood and gore. The photography is outstanding, the characters well casted and the action almost nonstop. It has no redeeming value, doesn't pretend to, but it is entertaining in a morbid sort of way, which is what you anticipated when you bought your ticket. Face it, many of us want to get as close to the gore as possible without really having to touch or smell it. If you want a serious drama, or a Walt Disney type film, why would you even consider going to see a film like this. The film is targeted toward maximum box office return and the producers scored on this point as it cost less than ten million dollars to produce but will easily gross over a 100 million at the box office. Give em what they want, I say, and they will pay for the slaughter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"- 10/10. Dramatic, intense, and overall genuinely scary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003)***Beware Of Major Spoilers Throughout The Entire Review*** - To start off, I will say that this is one of my favorite movies of all time. I enjoyed the ability that this movie had to throw at you scares, tension, and intensity, that I saw it three times! Yes, I saw The Texas Chainsaw Massacre three times, and I'm not ashamed at all. Not at all.Based loosely on true events (the crimes of Ed Gein), "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" begins with five young teens traveling across rural Texas to a Lynnrd Skynnrd concert. In this group of teenagers we have the good girl, Erin (Jessica Biel). The slutty hitchhiker whose character you can't help but like, Pepper (Erica Leerhsen). The cool guy, Andy (Mike Vogel). The jokester guy, Morgan (Jonathan Tucker). And the take charge guy who is the leader of the gang, Kemper (Eric Balfour). The group of five teens are having a good time, when they almost hit a disturbed girl (Lauren German) walking down the road. The get out to offer her a ride, and see that she is in a state of shock. They take her into their van and she begins mumbling about a "bad man" and telling them that they are all going to die. Then, the hitchiker begins to go crazy, puts a gun to her mouth, and pulls the trigger. Sick and puzzled, the teens drive to the nearest hillbilly town, and plan to meet a sheriff at a local mill. After arriving at the mill, there is no sign of a sheriff, and guided by a neglected child of the psychopathic family, Jedidiah (David Dorfman), they wander into the clutches of Leatherface at his rundown farmhouse.Director Marcus Nispel focuses more on keeping this film glossy and updated with more shadows and darkness, unlike the original "Chainsaw", which had a bright and scratchy, documentary style look to it. To tell you the truth, I disliked the original "Chainsaw" because of it's terrible acting and I found it a bit boring, but I will give it some credit because it's such a classic cult film. There are several neat shots in the new "Chainsaw", especially the one where the camera pans through the person's head and out the back window of the van after that person has shot themself in the head. I also loved the black and white police evidence footage that opened and closed the film, which I think brought it a feeling of realism. Producer Michael Bay (Pearl Harbor), didn't seem to me to have any experience in the horror genre, but pulls it off well. The filmmakers must have been aiming for a more realism in this horror film, unlike many we see today, and I will say they were dead right.The acting here is wonderful, with good performances by Leerhsen, Tucker, Vogel, and Balfour, whom are given little character background to work with, but they manage it perfectly. Biel was great as the last survivor, which you will know before even seeing the movie. On rule in horror movies is that the hottest girl in the movie will always live. R. Lee Ermey is pretty crazy as he pulls of his character of the insane, motor mouthed sheriff with a lot of intensity. He also has a couple of funny lines that will most likely make you laugh. I also enjoyed the narration during the police footage that ended and opened the movie, done by John Larroquette, narrator of the original "Chainsaw". The acting and narration in this movie is very good.The new and improved Leatherface (Andrew Bryniarski) is very scary, if not as scary as the original Leatherface was. Man, if you actually had this guy chasing you with a chainsaw, you'd be peeing your pants. His mask made of the human flesh is grotesque and disgusting, but has some modifications from the original mask. Through the last half hour of the movie, you'll be rooting for Jessica Biel as she gets chased all over by Leatherface, as Marilyn Burns did in the original film.Surprisingly, this movie had a lot more gore than the first film. Most of the deaths in this movie were done with the power tool you would have expected, the chainsaw. Andy's death was probably the most upsetting, and you will see why after watching this movie. Kemper's death was quick and jolting. Morgan's death was pretty vicious. But, Pepper's death was my favorite one, because of it's intensity and drama. The feathers that floated all over from Pepper's jacket that got tore open by the saw added some intensity, and made it all the more dramatic. Right after her death, you'll be a bit disturbed after you see what, or should I say 'who' Leatherface is wearing for a mask. That moment sort of set the ending of that sequence with a bit of a jolt. I won't tell you what he is wearing, because it will ruin it for you. See it for yourself, and it should freak you out a bit.To end this review, I want to say that this is a very good horror movie, one of the best I've seen. It has it all- intensity, gore, drama, scares, spills, and thrills! What more could you want to make a great movie??? This movie will be enjoyed by fans of the series, and fans of horror movies alike! I give The Texas Chainsaw Massacre a 10/10! And also remember, this movie sends out a strong message: never pick up hitchhikers!</fullReview>

Jessica Biel is very good and very hot!. all the actors are acting very well, especially the sheriff. The special effects were also good.Leatherface is maybe even scarier then jason voorhees. I really have no criticism about this movie. if you just want to enjoy a good horror movie, watch this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Masscre is probaly the best horror movie ive seen. The movie is set in i think 1973 from memory about 5 people who pick a up a girl they almost ran over. Soon after the girl starts goin crazy that their goin da rong way and blows her brains out. They then come to this house in the middle of nowhere. This is where all the horror starts. Jessica Biel is fantastic in this movie, her acting was very convincing, THe other cast members are also pretty good actors. For the directer i think this is his first film directing and did a very good job. This movie had a part in it that i for the first time did not want to watch on because it was so gross, and also becasuse of what i thought would of happened next luckily it didnt. This movie was awseme i couldnt stop thinking about it after i watched it. i give it a 4.5 out of 5, the best horror movie thats been made</fullReview>

I have seen it twice now and I'm so involved with the movie and the history behind it that it has got to be the best remake horror movie ever made. It was graphic and so detailed with all the events and drama's that unfold that I actually thought it was based on a true story. Its not.The movie is based on events such as the movie that took place in Texas but the movie and characters are just a fictional approach to set the movie's history down. Having said that I thought the entire cast was brillant and so incredibly had in down with realism. There acting was fantastic ! The crew including the director and writer did a fantastic job on scaring the crap out of me, so I thank them for that. I'm definitely buying the DVD.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

The way they were able to build suspense that led to nothing, just to get your guard down for when the real action happens was superb. The movie did have a couple of flaws, but i won't address them, because they really don't factor into the overall genius of this picture. The only thing that made me unhappy was that at my local theatre, they removed it to put Matrix Revolutions in. And i hate that movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense and disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate hollywood remakes of classic horror movies. I also, generally, hate horror movies whos cast look like they just stepped off a fashion runway. This movie has both of these undesirable qualities working against it. So I went into the theatre expecting to be very disappointed. Was I ever wrong.This is not a complete remake of the first movie.. Certain scenes and events may look familiar; you may think you know whats going to happen next.. but you dont. This is a very different movie experience.I loved the 1st TCM because it was disturbing on a psychological level. It wasn't gory like some people who have never seen it believe. But it worked nonetheless. It was creepy, gritty and bizarre.The new TCM is very psychological. It is also very violent, disturbing and intense. I haven't experienced so mush intensity in a movie theatre since Aliens. Once the chainsaw starts, hold on to your pants.I left the theatre extremely satisfied. My friend (who never watches horror movies and has never seen the 1st TCM) really didn't know what to say.. He jumped several times during the film.. I doubt he will ever watch a horror flick again.This one must be experienced on the big screen. Go see it now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On the Edge of My Seat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't say that about too many movies I've seen this year. Although I should mention that I have not seen the original yet but I decided not to before seeing this one which was a good idea. The reason being is the filmmakers of this version realized most of the kids going to see it would most likely not have seen the original since it came out years before they were born. With that said I was not making any comparisons in my mind to the original and therefore wasn't distracted from the raw effect of this movie. It literally did have me squirming on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. There were graphic and powerful images shot to the most vivid disturbing detail which stuck with me well after the movie ended. To me that is a true horror film experience without the camp or unnecessary nudity of a teen slasher flick. The dark mood and imagery throughout did the trick on a believably creepy level. It made me thank God there aren't truly people as horribly sick and twisted out there who exist like that or so I hope. Although this movie was loosely inspired by a serial killer who had a penchant for skinning his victims and also inspired other movies such as "Silence of the Lambs".As awful of a place this movie takes you to, you may find yourself wanting to stay. That's why the movie ends leaving you wanting more. I say it's a sure bet that was done intentionally and effectively by the filmmakers to leave the door open for followup films to further explore such a ghastly hell. Many questions are left unanswered. What ever happened to the one girl who managed to escape one of Leatherface's attacks early on in the film? Were any of Leatherface's psychotic family members implicated at all for the events that took place? And of course what happens to Jessica Biels' character after we last see her? We know she survives and it is implied she manages to get help and report what happened. Still you are left wondering, especially with the scene that follows, about what became of all the other characters who remained. I give this film 9 out of 10 stars for the suspense and haunting images.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Believe the Spoilers!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't usually bother responding to comments found on this site - mainly because I have found the comments usually average out in one direction or the other - in other words, whether the film is worth seeing or not!!!But with this film - all of that has changed!!!!I am sick to death (and I am sure that a lot of you "normal" people feel the same way) of people who discect and scrutinise over details within a film such as Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2003.To elaborate, this next paragraph is for all of you people who have written these "intelectual" reviews, because you feel a strong compulsion to air your own opinions on the matter. Please follow these two simple steps - it tends to work in most instances.Firstly .... In your mind, say the title of the film very, very slowly. If you cant manage to say it in your mind because your intelect hasn't developed above the white-trash depicted in the movie, then say it out load - but very, very slowly......T E X A S C H A I N S A W M A S S A C R E ..........Now, does the title of the movie suggest that it is trying to be anything more than a horror movie - a simple little scarey movie. Or does it suggest to you that they are trying to scoop all of the academy awards next year. I think not!!!!Secondly.... Get a Life!!!!!I had read so many unbelievable comments that I just had to go and see the film for myself and not wait for the dvd release. Comparisons with the original are ridiculous. If you are going to write a review, please review the movie on it's own and judge it by it's own merits.With a film in this genre, it simply does not matter that the small boy sub-plot does not work, Leatherface is too fat to be able to keep up with the other members of the cast or you need an IQ of less than 80 to be confused by the film - IT SIMPLE DOES NOT MATTER!!!!! I would rather you kept your opinions to yourself and either get yourself off to another trekkie convention or just boil your head .... very slowly.If you do not like the student slasher movie with lots of gore and guts, then you will not like this movie and you should therefore not review this type movie. That's not to say that you should all raise positive comments about this movie - but I would rather read a review from somebody that went into the theatre, liking the genre but expecting nothing. Not somebody that is expecting to see the next "Citizen Kane".Now that I have got that off my chest, here is a review from a person that is a fan of the genre but was expecting very little from the film .... myself.I loved every single minute, from the opening sequence to the final credits. I have never been in a theatre where loud screams have been heard during the showing and people simply getting up and leaving because they have had enough.... until now. The original film, as somebody quite rightly commented, leaves you with a nasty, empty feeling of disgust. This film just rips your guts out, stamps on it a few times, squeezes it through a mangler a couple of hundred times and then cunningly replaces it at the end without leaving a mark.If you like the kind of movies where you don't have to think too much and you love getting scared to death, then you must go and see this movie. If you get scared easily or you do not like to see people's legs get sawn off by a 300Ib hillbilly with a flesh mask and a chainsaw - then go and see shrek again and write a review of how funny Eddie Murphy is and how masterly the artwork is - then boil your head!!!Best Horror/Slasher movie I have seen for years 8.5/10 !!!!!NB: I am thinking of starting my own political party, which will have only one policy:Idiots that think they have the right to have an opinion on something they were never going to enjoy in the first place, must have their heads boiled at least once per week until they can fight the compulsion to comment.Anybody wanna join ......

		<fullReview>"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" was a controversal film based on the events of Ed Gein who was a serial killer back in the 1950s.The film shocked moviegoers due to the violence and material that followed it.Moviegoers reacted in ways such as leaving the theater.None of these people didn't have to watch the film,but they chose to and those who had seen the film would probably tell you that it was one of the most disturbing films they had seen in years.I wonder what those same people would say about the remake.I have seen both the 1974 and 2003 versions.To simply tell you,I thought they were both pretty good.Although I think the original is better because it was raw and was more sadistic and twisted.The remake was a good time at the movies for me.I thought it brilliantly recreated the old days of splatter and added some new twists to the film.Director Marc Nipsel or Nispel does a pretty good job whith the film because he takes the entire film and mixes it with scenes that were never filmed in the original.This is one of those films that had me staring at the screen because I wanted to see more.I know people who would object to seeing this film because they think the original was better,which it was.I prefer the original because it was in your face and the violence was subtle.The remake is enjoyable and I liked it because of its ability to make me remember the old days of film splatter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hopefully intellectual account of one of the horror genre's prized offspring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This revisit to a classically horrific terror trip opens with a van of Dallas bound sexy, oily, twenty somethings high on life (and some primo smuggled Mexican marijuana). Jessica Biel (The Rules of Attraction), Jonathan Tucker (The Deep End), Eric Balfour (6 feet Under), Erica Leerhsen (Book of Shadows: Blair Witch II) and Mike Vogel (Grind) take in a hitchhiker after narrowly avoiding making her an addition to the road kill population. The less than coherent new passenger soon withdraws a pistol and suicidally decorates the back seat of their van, thrusting the five young friends into the creepy underworld of a nowhere Texas town.Not unlike her do-gooder 7th Heaven co-stars, Biel decides to follow protocol and make her crew wait for the local authorities to visit their slaughter scene van. What else to do while waiting for the sheriff than to explore run-down homes, rusted mills and dilapidated cars? Cue: typically fatal errors of sitting in locked cars at night, hiding in closets, running through leaky basement labyrinths, investigating strange noises and seeking refuge in a trashy, rusted out recreational vehicle from a chainsaw wielding taxidermist freak show.The soundtrack features eerie creaks, squeaky windmill screeches and squealing swine that recall Tobe Hooper's 1974 original. Obvious homage is also paid to Scream Queen Marilyn Burns (Sally, in the 1974 version) in an inter-forest chase scene between the ever-menacing Leatherface and the screaming, limb-flailing Biel - almost identical in choreography and vocals to a scene from the original.Though the film has its share of masochistically crowd-pleasing gore (though surprisingly not a lot) and banshee shrieks, the spotlight exploration of the backwoods cannibalistic Texas family is what's more fear inducing. Directed by Marcus Nispel (with little to his directorial credits other than a music video), the film is thankfully not over laden with obvious digital effects but relies on classic `No! Not in there!' scenes and the viewer's underlying fear of the terror infamous small town back roads might hold. Perhaps Nispel has found his genre of choice and more freakish macabre delights can be expected.</fullReview>

Mr. Pearl has obviously been working in the commercials world quite a bit, as the look was about as "cutting edge" as you could get.Visually it's stunning, and the casting is very, very good. I found myself squirming a few times in my seat.The production design was unbelievable. Nice!

And she can act too.Nitpicking: Would have been nice to actually get to hear some Skynyrd, since they were mentioned a dozen times.The phrase "sexually transmitted disease" was not commonly used in the early 70's as far as I know.Jessica Biel's pants were not early 70's vintage, but who's gonna complain?</fullReview>

It is a good movie and it did awake something that was dead for a while but it brought nothing new to the horror genre.The directing was fine. The cinematography was excellent. The acting was decent.

		<shortDescription>Stellar film soiled by a sour ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you take on the name Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you've got a lot to live up to. I'll try not to compare this film to the original, but failing to draw any reference point to it is impossible and irresponsible.This movie starts strong. Very strong. In fact, it made me quite uneasy and I found it to be disturbing and unsettling, just as it should be. It even made me uncomfortable and I wasn't sure how much more I could take. I haven't seen the original film in quite some time, but I dare say this one did just as good of a job creating a creepy environment. They changed enough to make the story fresh and interesting, but left enough to make it recognizable as TCM.The film chugs along like this for 70 or 80 minutes, and I was totally impressed. Then it begins to go downhill and fall flat on its face. Now we have to look at the original for a minute. What is Texas Chainsaw Massacre? Well, it's a guy with a chainsaw chasing people around and killing them, right? Wrong. Leatherface and the chainsaw are barely even in the original movie. If that description were accurate, TCM would not live in notoriety; it would be the same as every other horror movie. TCM is a horrendously disturbing film that builds horror through empathy for the main character in bizarre situations and making the viewer ask himself, "what would I do if that happened to me?" This is what made the first TCM great. It is also what made the first two thirds of this version great. However, the film quickly slips into the "guy chasing girl with weapon" formula. And I think I've seen that movie before several times...it was called Friday the 13th, Halloween, Scream, or something. Once that cat and mouse game starts, I completely lose empathy for the main character. No longer is she in a helpless situation and it's more difficult to empathize because deep down you know how ridiculous it is.Unfortunately, this film falls into that trap in spades, complete with smart girl beating up bad guy with sharp weapon only to have him magically reappear later at an impossible time to chase her some more. Ho-hum. That's just not scary. The original TCM gave the audience more credit than that and stayed with the empathy formula just getting creepier and weirder far beyond your wildest expectations.The bottom line is that this new TCM film does not fail in comparison to the original nearly so much as it fails in comparison to itself. It starts off so good and had it just stuck to its creepy feel instead of going to chase scenes, it could have been an incredible film. Tack on an ultra ultra cheesy ending that is a blatant rip-off of Blair Witch, and you leave the theater scratching your head wondering if someone was deliberately trying to ruin this film. I can't say not to see this movie because I really liked it. I'm just angry because I should have loved it. They were so close to making something exceptional that it's so disappointing to see them drop the ball. It still stands as a pretty good movie, but if you want it to be great you should leave in the middle and then go home and watch the second half of the original. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong, but "slick", and not in a good way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, the chainsaw remake has everything you would expect from a glossy remake: spectacular sets, dazzling cinematography, attractive performers and seamless fx. And that's the problem.The original chainsaw was a low-to-the-ground, brutal exercise where each scene asked "how could it possibly be any more horrifying?" before upping the ante on the movie's depravity in the following scene. It was primal, and charged forward from the filmmaker's desire to affect the audience. You simply cannot make a trimmed and tight version of something that works BECAUSE it is harsh and undercooked. Still, Scot Kosar's script nicely echoes the original, and Daniel Pearl (the original movie's DP) effectively utilizes bleach-bypass to render the film muted and brown yet contrasty. Overall, I'd recommend TCM2003 IF you haven't seen the original, or if you are a completist, like me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad, Just Unnnecessary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not as bad as you might expect, considering that it's a remake of a classic, but I was left wondering why they bothered? This is a classic example of the idea of diminishing returns: "It did so well the first time around, it will do even better when we remake it." We've seen a bunch of these ill-informed remakes in the last few years. Everything from "Psycho" to "Halloween." Not a single one has managed to outstrip its inspiration. They might have included more blood and violence, which is what seems to pass for creativity these days, but there's not a single moment that makes you forget the originals.This is not a bad film, but a completely unnecessary one. Obviously, Hollywood values trading on the brand name more than mining new territory, which is sad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new remake from classic Hooper film with high budget and lots of violence and gore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An idyllic journey in southern Texas driving a van by a group of young people(Jessica Biel,Eric Balfour,Jonathan Tucker,Mike Vogel,Erica Leerhsen) becomes a nightmare when they pick up a young girl. A disgrace is committed and they are looking for the sheriff(R. Lee Ermey). Later, they wind up in the nightmare clutches of a homicidal family who kill and eat passing travellers; finally are pursued by maniac Leatherface wielding a chainsaw.This film contains images of graphic violence and may not be suitable for all audiences. Viewer discretion is advised. The movie packs grisly horror, tension, mayhem, horrible gore and lots of blood and guts. The creepy screenplay by Tobe Hooper-also author of original script- and lavish production by the great Joel Silver along with Hooper. The motion picture is well directed by Marcus Nispel.The film is based on real events about the secluded farmhouse of Plainfield (Wisconsin)handyman Ed Gein,( Leatherface character) who admitted today he disembowelled and butchered the body of old widow, authorities found the decapitated boy hanging in Gein's woodshed, gutted out and strung up by the heels. Investigators have also discovered the head and face of 54 years old woman. Portions of the bodies of ten or more people had also been found among the body parts, human skulls, furniture made of human skill, box full of noses, skin from a human head, a belt made of female nipples, one small skull believed to be that of a six-year-old child. Authorities suspected cannibalism. The Ed Gein grisly killings made horrendously startling to people. The Geins lived a fairly good distance away from Plainfield little town. When we look at Gein's life , we just have this sense of incredible isolation from any human contact, except with his crazy mother. He grew up in a household with an alcoholic and abusive father and a mother who was very domineering. She was a fanatic and did not let Ed or his brother to have much to do with the outside world, because there were sinners out there.The mother denied them any meaningful relationship with the outside world and particularly with women . So Gein grew up with this very powerful ambivalence towards his mother and he developed this resentment and hatred . Gein was looked at as the nerdy kid that his contemporaries would poke fun at, which also tended to confirm for him a lot of his mother's paranoia. Gein's house really was a symbolic representation of what was going on his head. He kept many dentures and human bodies around.Firsly, he started robbing graves. Gein said that he had begun to do this a few years after his mother's death. He almost seemed to take a glee in creating novel artifacts out dead bodies, and various human handiwork .He would make bells made out of nipples and used human shinbones to prop up a coffee table, plus took the tops of skulls and inverted them and used them four soup bowls and upholstered a chair in human skin. Like the film, he cut the faces of corpses and used them as masks and flayed the top of the torso of one of his victims and also created some leggings. After he began to sew together these parts of skin from various corpses, events correctly reflected on this creepy movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"- 10/10. The scariest movie I have seen in years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003)***Warning: Review Contains Spoilers*** I absolutely loved this movie. It had the ability to scare you, thrill you, and make you scream all together. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long, great while. I saw this movie three times, and I'm not ashamed at all.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre starts off with a group of five teenagers driving through rural Texas on their way to a rock concert. We have the good girl, Erin (Jessica Biel), the slutty hitchiker whose character you can't help but like, Pepper (Erica Leerhsen), the cool guy, Andy (Mike Vogel), the jokester guy, Morgan (Jonathan Tucker), and the take charge guy, Kemper (Eric Balfour). The group is driving along when they almost hit a traumatized girl on the road. They pick her up and take her into the van, and she begins mumbling things like "he's a bad man", and "your all gonna die". Then, she pulls out a gun and kills herself in front of them all. Si ck and puzzled, the gang drives to the nearest town, which is a redneck town, and they plan to meet the local sheriff (R. Lee Ermey) at an abandoned mill. After arriving there and seeing no sheriff, they one by one wander to the dilapidated farmhouse of Thomas Hewitt, or Leatherface, and his psychotic family of murderers.The actors in this movie where wonderful. Leerhsen, Vogel, Balfour, and Tucker are given a very minimum of character background to work with, and they pull it off spectacularly. Jessica Biel, the only survivor of the massacre, is great, and man can she scream! R. Lee Ermey is downright scary as the crazed Sheriff Hoyt, as is the rest of his family, especially the new and improved Leatherface. Imagine that guy running after you with a chainsaw!Director Marcus Nispel keeps things appropriately dark and eerie, which is exactly the opposite of the '74 original movie. Instead of focusing on a scratchy documentary type style (like the original), Nispel goes for the more glossy, updated look, which works out well. I never thought that Michael Bay, producer of Pearl Harbor, would have done a horror movie, but he showed me how well he can make one.The intensity of this movie was off the charts, and it kept you on the edge of your seat the whole ride through. This movie was incredibly gory. If you have a weak stomach, you may want to skip this because of it's gore. It's pretty disturbing watching Leatherface "treat" some of his victims in his ways.My favorite scenes in the film are when Erin and Andy go to the house and are chased by Leatherface, and Pepper's death scene in the van. That scene was intense, dramatic and horrifying, and I think the feathers floating from Pepper's torn jacket added something more.If you haven't seen this movie, see it now and you won't be disappointed. It will scare you to death. I recommend this movie for horror fans. Serious fans of the original will hate this, but others like me, will love it. 10/10.</fullReview>

There is a sensation of horror and degradation wich few other movies have.Also the end when Leatherface goes out from the deep obscurity remains in the mind. jessica Biel is wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of the year?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a long-time fan of the original, I fully expected to hate this with the vehemence with which I hated the last 'remake' they made- the appallingly titled and just plain dreadful 'TCM-The Next Generation'. Instead I walked out of the cinema elated that I'd seen, for the first time since 'Blair Witch' four years ago, a movie that had actually scared the hell out of me. The Hooper original was one of the first modern horror movies I saw, way back in about 1985 which, along with American Werewolf, first turned me on to the genre. Long have I championed it's cause to those who haven't seen it and heavy do my shelves groan under the weight of Chainsaw-related stuff. Well, a few videos, some DVDs, some books and a dusty Leatherface model anyway. This new one though... wow! Like some skewed night-terror version of familiar events we've experienced a hundred times, the 2003 TCM twists off the established track and takes us places we would rather not go. The controversial face-reveal, the unexpected demise of the hitcher, the dust-dry bright Texan farmhouse of the original replaced by the dripping, dark, underground slaughterhouse, the lack of a dinner scene, the nods to 'Psycho', the revenge-fuelled climax that distracts from the movie's core, only to disarm us against the knockout final jump scene... it was all pitch-perfect. Loved the Leatherface backstory, not because it gave him "depth" or "justification" but because it felt so *wrong* and once again served to create unease in a film where the unease is piled on thicker than headcheese. I could go on. It has some flaws. That fat geek from that movie website turning up as a severed head was unnecessary and weak and merely serves to fuel his alarming ego. It suffers from the lack of an unsympathetic disabled character- a brave move in '73 conspicuous by its abcense in these politically correct days. The leads were too Hollywoody and maybe Mr. Face's mask wasn't *quite* as effective as the original. Maybe the labrynthian plot distracted from the slimline, no-nonsense linear nature of the original, but hell, I don't care. It gets a perfect ten from me and I demand a sequel. Best horror movie of the year and for several years.</fullReview>

I get absorbed into the movie and forget everything going on around me. Should the makers of TCM 2003 ever read this review I want to take this opportunity to say a big fat THANKYOU for giving me the heebie-jeebies like no other movie has ever done before! There are too many critics ready to slate films all the time. Why do they even go to the cinema??

Usually, the acting in horror movies is...bad. But, in this the cast is awesome. Jessica Biel is the new scream queen! The supporting actors, Leehrsen, Vogel, Balfour, etc. were awesome as well. Leatherface is just a plain bad ass, and he is scary as hell. Even though, this film isn't based on a guy with a chainsaw, it tells you it is. Which makes it even more suspenseful. Those who are bad mouthing this movie were expecting it to be exactly like the 1974 version. I have news for you: IT ISN'T MEANT TO BE EXACTLY THE SAME. That is what makes it so original even though it is a remake.</fullReview>

Sleepers and unknowns like Shockwaves, and I am telling you this rates in my all time top 5... I have seen it twice in the last 3 days and will see it again.. It follows the story of the first one, but changes it up enough to where you are not able to predict what will happen when it happens.. Very scary, we were in a packed theater (Both times) and girls where screaming their heads off (and some guys) People gave the movie a standing ovation at the end (I have never seen that) One guy sumed up his fear at the end by saying "I am never going to Texas".... This movie rules, do your self a favor and go see it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Could it be the dark theater? Could it be the creepy noises? The creepy images? Or perhaps the plain unsettlement of everything in this movie. I can't reccomend this movie to everyone, because it's not for everyone. I've seen the original, and I'm an "Evil Dead" kinda man myself, so the 1970's version of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" didn't really scare me, or make me laugh, or entertain me. No offense to the fans of the film, that's just one man's opinion. However it did stand on it's own grounds for what it did at that time. In a way you could say that the re-make does as well. Roger Ebert, who am I a huge fan of, hated this movie. I won't quote him, but he said that the movie was along the lines of pointless and gross. That it wasn't artistic or meaningful (what movies are these days). However I must say that Roger Ebert had no clue what he was talking about. Or if he did, then he should have given praise to what the director, Marcus Nispel did. He tried his best to make a dark grueling terrifying film, that when you left the theater you would feel...empty.The film makes you believe that what happened ACTUALLY Happened. Well I really wish it did happen, cause it sure would make the enviornment of the film scarier and more real. The film gives you teens that you can actually care about. Not stupid souless characters to get killed. ones you can actually NOT want to die.Roger Ebert gave the film no stars, and I'm no critic or proffesional, but the film is called "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" for a reason. Don't go to see it for relation to the original, go see it because of a whole new experience! I give it ***1/2 out of ****! It delivers exactly what you would pay for. The TITLE</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BEST horror movie EVER!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite what anyone says about the original TCM, the remake is 1000 times better! The acting is excellent, the special effects are spectacular, and the plot is scarier, more realistic, and much more interesting. I don't know if this would be considered a SPOILER or not, but I think the most important change they made from the original movie is that they explained HOW and WHY Leatherface ended up the way he did. He had a pretty nasty skin disease, and so (naturally) everyone made horrible fun of him. Yes, this creates a sense of compassion and makes you actually like him a little, but it doesn't take away the scariness--on the contrary, it makes the movie much scarier (Hey, I could hardly sleep for a week or two!). One of the things I always look for in a good movie or book is being able to empathize with at least one character. It just makes everything more real. And that was one of the scariest parts about the movie. I mean just think--it could be you! Not some completely crazed, howling lunatic, but you! Heck, it could even be the nerd you laughed at in high school. The point is, unlike in the first movie, everything is just so possible. It could really be happening. While we're at home laughing and enjoying a movie with our families, someone could be cutting up people's corpses in their basement. That's what makes the remake so much better than the original. Not only that, but they didn't mention cannibalism at all in the remake. The idea of someone being so angry at the world that the enjoy cutting people up and mutilating them is both WAY more interesting and less abstract than people eating other people. Another thing that makes the remake so much better. One of the things that really got to me about the original is that the main character, Sally, is such a wimp! All she does is run around, shriek, and cry throughout the whole movie. It's not only insulting to watch (as a woman), but it's boring and again, UNrealistic and lame. I think just about anyone would have put up more of a fight. In the remake, Erin (they changed the name from Sally to Erin) kills some real butt. Yes, she freaks out a lot, but who wouldn't? She actually does something to defend herself, adding a lot more action and making the movie more interesting and more fun to watch. The new The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is simply better, more interesting, more realistic, and, above all, SOOOO much scarier! I'd recommend it for anyone who likes a true horror movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare remake that keeps the spirit of the original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surprisingly excellent remake of Tobe Hooper's 1974 horror classic is a highly underrated shocker that keeps to its original roots!In the summer of 1973, five youths driving through the Texas country side fall into the hands of a crazed, murderous clan.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2003 is the best example thus far of how a good horror remake should be done. The film wisely sticks to the premise of the original classic but it also is clever enough to introduce new characters, thus not letting us know what to expect even though a strong sense of dread is looming. The new screenplay also adds lots of new frightening situations, taught with suspense and a solidly eerie introduction and conclusion in a documentary style. It well keeps the audience on the edges of their seats. Director Marcus Nispel does a splendidly good job of creating a hot, fearful atmosphere much like that of the original 'Texas Chainsaw. But differing of course is the fact that this film has a much more 'polished' look to it, unlike the grainy original, but that thankfully doesn't take away from the startling happenings. Also differing from the original film is the fact that Texas Chainsaw 2003 packs plenty of gut-wrenching gore that is truly shocking! It all adds up to a very scary and disturbing kind of horror movie.The cast is terrific. Biel, Tucker, Leerhsen, Vogel, and Balfour make for some great youths, it's not hard to like any of them. Ermey does an especially memorable performance as a sinister sheriff, while Bryniarski makes for a perfectly scary Leatherface.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2003 stands out as one of the best horror remakes to date! It well lives up to Hoopers great original film, while being a new and very horrifying ride of its own.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An almost equal remake of the greatest horror film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first read in Fangoria magazine that there was going to be a remake of my favorite horror film, "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", I was more than a little upset. I was downright p***ed. Then I saw the trailer, and it actually looked scary... damn scary. But I didn't keep my expectations too high because this was a Hollywood remake of an independent horror classic.Man, was I surprised!!! This movie kicked ass! But in totally different - and yet some of the same - ways that the original did. For example; in the original there was practically no gore (with the exception of Leatherface accidentally slicing some meat off his own leg), but the scares came more from the suspense and psychological horror and torture the victims were subjected to. Whereas the remake supplies plenty of gore (not an exploitative amount though) that is used to disturb and scare us. Also there was always an overwhelming sense of dread for what was to become of the victims in the original masterpiece. And the remake keeps that same sense throughout the whole film.The acting in the first "Chainsaw" was pretty good for an independent horror film in the 70's, but this one's got it beat. Jessica Biel is superb as a scream queen. The supporting cast is very effective also.All in all, this is a perfect horror film. And while it may not replace the original as my favorite... it definitely places in my top ten of horror. I only hope the "Dawn of the Dead" remake fairs as well (although, with running and jumping zombies instead of slow and lumbering, I have my doubts).1) The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)2) The Evil Dead3) Dawn of the Dead (1978)4) Re-Animator5) Return of the Living Dead6) Day of the Dead7) The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003)8) Zombie9) Cannibal Holocaust10) From Dusk till Dawn</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great and Brutal Remake That Makes Leatherface Scary Again!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been years since I've watched this remake, and I think it's grown on me since the last time I've watched it. In my opinion, I think it's better than the 1974 classic because the storyline is better, the characters are better developed and we sympathize with them more when they're killed off. Some remakes copy the original word for word like the Psycho remake and it was terrible. Some remakes like to update and make new characters, new dialogue and new ways to kill people like this and Dawn of the Dead. Rob Zombie's Halloween told a backstory, while remaking some scenes from the original 1978 classic. I think this one works really well because it was different. I'm glad they left out the annoying brother, Franklin and not having a Sally Hardesty character to scream her head off the last 15 minutes of the movie. This one felt more realistic and scary. At times, R. Lee Ermey's character, Sheriff Hoyt takes away from Leatherface, who is the main attraction while watching a TCM movie. Jessica Biel was very good as Erin, the main lead. Her acting was very convincing like she was actually being tortured, physically and emotionally. On August 18th, 1973, Erin and her friends are on their way to a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert after returning from Mexico to buy marijuana. They stop and pick a hitchhiker who looks like she's been thru Hell. She rambles about a bad man and shoots herself in the mouth. While looking for the Sheriff to take her body away, they run into Leatherface and his creepy cannibalistic family. If you love horror and remakes, you'll love THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, the original 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' was a classic ? or rather a classic if you enjoyed seeing innocent teens getting dismembered or eaten alive by sadistic inbred mutants. But then, based on the success of the nineteen seventies slasher, a lot of people did enjoy watching that sort of thing. So here comes the obligatory up-to-date Hollywood big budget remake. And, believe it or not, it's actually quite good.No, seriously ? don't let Michael 'Transformers' Bay's name on the publicity put you off. He obviously didn't have that much to do with it and was too busy destroying much loved eighties toy franchises to meddle in the Texas Chainsaw's remake. There's none of his slow motion camera-work or explosions with those weirdly-pretty fireworks in it.Instead, what you have is a reasonable version of the original source material. You have the teens. Yes, they're hardly the most varied bunch in terms of likable characters, but they're our heroes and they're just about watchable enough for you to not really want them to be severed in two alive. But no one really cares about them. It's the villains who steal the show. Of course you have the hulking chainsaw-wielding psycho known only as 'Leatherface' who you certainly wouldn't want to bump into in a dark alley (or small, out-of-the-way backwater American town), but it's R. Lee Ermey who steals the show as the truly psychotic one (and he never even picks up a chainsaw!).Yes, it's not as 'raw' as the original. It does a good job of capturing the general seventies vibe, but comes across as a much slicker production all together. And that's no bad thing. It's literally a retelling, taking most of the original's bits and repackaging them in a slightly different way. There's more to the story as it's more complex (but not really that much more complex ? it's still a guy in a skin-mask chasing kids around a field with a chainsaw).If you like your slasher films and aren't totally put off yet another Hollywood remake of a classic horror gem then give this one a go. It's a rare example of a remake that's actually pretty good. This and the 2004 version of Dawn of the Dead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003): Dir: Marcus Nispel / Cast: Jessica Biel, R. Lee Ermey, Eric Balfour, Mike Vogel, David Dorfman: Although not as pitiful as the Psycho remake, this is still a pointless mess at any rate. It regards an event or crime based on fact regarding killer Ed Gein who is portrayed here as Leather-Face who uses the skin of his victims to create his own person. One element that both films have in common is effective opening scenes. In the original a van load of hippies pick up a deranged hitchhiker, whereas in the remake they pick up a victim who eventually shoots herself. Teenagers stop off at a farm house where chainsaw wielding Leather-face and the rest of his insane family slice and dice them. Not a bad effort by director Marcus Nispel but he is no Tobe Hooper. Only R. Lee Ermey is interesting as the deranged Sheriff. Jessica Biel runs and screams and survives because she is the star. It might have helped greater had she endured more of the mayhem that Marilyn Burns put up with while being forced to be at a demented family dinner where she was sighted as the main course. Eric Balfour and Mike Vogel die graphic deaths. That seems to be the point of this junk. Presents mindless idiots to be murdered by barn yard tools. The original presented a realistic happening while this remake showcases an encore of nonsense. Score: 3 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is good, for a remake. It had a few cool and good scary moments to the movie. Like Leatherface getting his arm chopped off. That was cool. It did have SOME stupid and bad scenes. Like Leatherface coming out of the bushes, after getting his arm cut off and chainsaws some of the car. It was alright. I didn't think that was necessary. Also the girl leaves in MUCH better condition. She is a little sweaty, but over all, she is driving a car okay. In the original she is covered in blood and screaming, injured, and crying. It makes it scarier that way. But not when the girl is fine. The movie also had AMAZING effects. Like when Andy ran and got his leg cut off. It looked really realistic. The dialog in the movie was pretty cool too. The costumes looked awesome. Overall, the movie was pretty cool. It recommend we all see it if you seen the original. I like the original better.

		<fullReview>I'm not always about having to remake everything but this one was worthy. I loved the night shoot scenes it had a creepy ambiance to it. The fog filtering in gave it a nice touch especially when Jessica Biel is running through the woods trying to escape Leatherface very scary. I thought that Jessica Biel and Eric Balfour had excellent chemistry together. I felt that Jonathan Tucker, Mike Vogel and Erica Leerhsen gave great performances as well and they felt like a tight knit group which is always a plus. R. Lee Ermey playing Sheriff Hoyt was perfect because he's got that craziness with a dash of warped sense of humor down. I thought the opening of the movie had a nice mixture of humor and fear to get you enthralled into the story. The original was a classic but this version I think does it justice. Personally I love this version it's a classic in it's own right. It doesn't hurt that Jessica Biel is in it running around in the woods showing off her sexy midriff as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Texas Chainsaw Massacre (TCM) film for myself is certainly a guilty pleasure, for the unpopular reason of not being high on Tobe Hooper's original, this remake was justified. I'd still give the slight nod to the original TCM, however they are very much on equal footing. It's understandable, there are so many reasons this film could gain negative responses, the decision making by characters were outrageous at times, dialogue and acting were laughable constantly and the girt and atmosphere was not present at all.Despite those critical pitfalls there is a good list of arguments on how the film was superior to many TCM and redneck/bumbkin films. For starters, Leatherface was at his best in this film, the actor had the perfect large, fat size but possessed an athletic body to run just as fast as everyone else. His demeanor was cold and ruthless with no mental deficiencies, instead suffering from a hideous skin disease. Secondly, R. Lee Emery as the Sheriff and father figure of the family was a terrific casting call by the director and producers. Bringing his hard militaristic attitude to the TCM franchise was awesome to watch. This new TCM family wasn't as outlandishly crazy as the original bringing more realistic cold-blooded approach. There isn't a ton of gore particularly but the scenes are hard-hitting, very violent, and remained to have a heart-pounding suspense. By remake standards, Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) is above average on the remake spectrum, give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original 1974 of The Texas chainsaw massacre is very scary. And this remake from 2003 is just boring and pointless. The Texas chainsaw massacre 2 is 1003 times better. Leather face Texas chainsaw massacre 3 is 1002 time better. This movie is very overrated. I know a lot of you think this is better then Texas chainsaw massacre generation. Which the forth Texas chainsaw massacre movie. The true is that Texas chainsaw massacre the next generation is a great movie and is 1000 time better then this crape. It is so mush like the original that there is no point to this movie. The only thing different about this movie is an awful ending. And so extra characters that a just there to die. There is woman is runs away from killers. Makes it so safety. And then kills herself. This movie is terribly written.</fullReview>

OK, it's nicely shot and better paced than the original, but the initial mistakes of songs playing on the 8-track/radio that hadn't even been released (and then mentioned about in the forthcoming concert they're on their way to see) annoyed me intensely! How hard can it be to get simple facts like that checked out in the first instance! Someone should be chainsawed for that! Even the main set pieces of the sliding door, boyfriend attack in the original (and the subsequent impaling on the hook) are way better in the Tobe Hooper original. And how can you completely disregard the whole cannibal aspect of the story? Sacrilege! It's OK but watch "I Spit On Your Grave" and "The Evil Dead" remakes for better remakes...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert!!! OK this is a remake of a cult classic horror film that really didn't need to be remade. The original was so well done that you can't expect much from this film right? Well I gave it a chance and I must say it did have some good gore and violence and music but that's not exactly why the original was so popular at the time. There really was no music that I remember being in the original which actually helped build the suspense and make it more realistic. There also wasn't a whole lot of gore which meant you had to use your imagination to picture how each one died and I must say for a slasher film that's pretty creative. The mask in the original film was the most scariest part of the film, alone. This film however does have a decent mask it's just not the same as the original. Again this film is a typical mediocre remake and like always it isn't able to capture the feeling of the original, I give it a fair 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

Overall an OK remake and movie in general but the original is still better.

		<fullReview>"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is a disappointing remake of a classic horror film that strays drasticly from the original in the telling. This is not a frame-for-frame remake like Gus Van Sant's "Psycho" but a so-called retelling or revisioning. (A bullshit term for filmmakers who think that they can improve on the original.)This version plays like the first "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" meets "Deliverence" meets "The Blair Witch Project" with extremely mixed results. Some parts of this movie is better than the original with more money thrown at it which is a huge plus. On the other hand the scenes that were great in the original have been left out of this version much to my disappointment and disbelief such as the wheelchair bound character who you constantly feel sorry for and frightened for due to the fact that he could be killed at any moment because he was incapable of getting away quickly.The opening looks like outtakes from "The Blair Witch Project" and is certainly one of many mistakes made by the filmmakers. (Though getting John Larroquette to do the narration is a nice touch.)What this movie suffers from is over explanation. The original film is simplistic which is one of its virtues and didn't feel the need to have a back story for everyone and everything. Do we really care where these characters have been, why they were there and where there heading? Do we care why Leatherface is the way he is? Of course not. Slicing and dicing, thrills and scares. That's it. No psychoanalying. Just a bunch of young people who are in the wrong place at the wrong time.While the photography at some points is strangely beautiful, the production design is dirty and grimy and out of touch with the camerawork. The original film had that hand-held, gritty, low-budget look that seemed to make sense and fit in with the tone of the story.Another question you have to ask yourself is why take perfectly normal actors and make them up to look ugly or deformed? There must be working actors in Hollywood that are disfigured. Why not cast them?The movie does have great locations such as the gothic house that Leatherface and his family live in. But the scenes in the meat works are largely disappointing. A fantastic addition to the movie wasted because of unimaginitive action.The suicide in the van and Leatherface chasing one of his victims through clotheslines certainly stand out but they are nothing compared to the very last scene from the original where the clearly delirious herione is being driven away from Leatherface as he angrily dances infront of a perfect sunrise. If only this new version was as perfect as that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler I am so sick of people trying to compare this with the original. Texas Chainsaw Massacre as some elements of the original, but it was an entirely different movie. Sure, i loved the storyline better in the original, bad storyline in the newer one, but better characters in the new one. They were well developed and if anyone is going to criticize Jessica Beil and give props to Maryln Burns, let me say that all Maryln did was run, scream, Jessica's character was more stronger. I felt for the characters. What was missing was, what happened to Morgan? We don't see him get tortured, but just found in the basement. They should have had Jessica waking up to the dinner table. I felt sorry for Andy. He went through a lot of torture and the scene was brilliant when Erin killed him. I loved Leatherface in this one, he was more darker. THe original Leatherface was more of a Ed Gein. I didn't care for the family of weirdos in the new one, didnt make sense. The hitchiker in the new one really shocked me where that scene went. Over all, its a scary movie, my friends jumped. Be glad what you get for horror films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake was better than I expected. While it's not one of the best films of the year, it's certainly not the worst either.It's legtimately frightenning in several parts, and there are times when you are on the edge of your seat- but with as many rip-offs as there have been, some of it seems familiar.The performances aren't bad for this type of film. Jessica Biel does well for what she has to work with, R. Lee Ermey is really effective as the local sherrif who may know more than what he says he does. And Andrew Bryniarski (The boxer who fights Cuba Gooding, Jr. in "Pearl Harbor".) makes Leatherface very frightening. Not to knock Ken Kirzinger, but Bryniarski might have been a good Jason in "Freddy vs. Jason"The production design is pretty good, too- it looks very grim and dark. It's very appropriate for a film like this, and really works.But what I will say is that the filmmakers should have cut down on the gore some. Not since the film "Hannibal" have I seen so much. What worked for movies like "Silence of the Lambs" and the original "Psycho", is it wasn't what you saw- it's what you didn't see that made it so effective. So, this film isn't for the weak of heart or stomach.So, if you don't mind films like these, step on up. But if you hate seeing blood, this is not the film for you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another example of taking a good idea and ruining it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) is a prime example of a film studio taking a good idea that has already been done to satisfaction and turning it into a hollywood crap fest. I've read posts here where people have said that you can't go into this movie expecting it to be like the original. Well I didn't, and guess what? It still sucks! It seems to me that the only reason behind the making of this film was to portray the torture of the blonde kid. If they had called the film, say, Dead Skin Mask, or, Leatherface part 5: reborn, or something along those lines then I wouldn't have to give this film such a huge thumbs down. But the truth of the matter is that they named this movie The Texas Chainsaw Massacre which demands that certain comparisons to the original be made. I'm going to state some of the reasons that the original is such a classic that they felt the need to cash in even 30 years after it's release followed by reasons why this so-called re-make is such a turkey:1. Brutally shocking horror on a mostly psychological level. The remake has all the gruesome visuals of a first rate higher than average budget exploitation exercise with none of the psychological impact that makes for a true classic horror film.2. Realistic characters. Now I'm not saying that the original film had great character developement, but at least they were believable. The remake had characters straight out of a '90's country music video. I'm supposed to believe that these events took place in the early '70's when the characters are all dressed and act like gen-x kids?3. Plot developement. In the original, you had the hitchhiker at the beginning who seemed to be a throw away character used only as a bad omen, then you had Leatherface. The film had you believe that a lone psycho was responsible for the mayhem. Towards the end when the 'family' got together was a great plot twist. Leatherface went from fearsome, unstoppable killer to blundering inbred when his....uh...dad(?) and brother came home. The remake didn't have any sort of coherent link between all the family members, why bar-b-que was important, or even how they related to each other as a family. It was all just a jumbled mess of too many unnecessary characters thrown around to keep us distracted from the fact that this movie has no direction! Oh, and the 'poor Leatherface was teased at school for a disfiguring skin disease' explanation for his murder spree(s) is about as contrived and cliche' as it comes. Get a grip, people.4. The house. In the original, we were treated to a dilapidated house with decor including the bones of humans and animals hanging from the ceiling, from the walls, and strewn about the floor. Furniture and lamps made out of said bones, including a very literal 'arm' chair delivering a sence that these people are completely mad and there is NO escape! In the remake, we are treated to a dilapidated house thats about as bland as mashed potatos minus milk, butter, garlic, and salt. There is absolutely nothing menacing or unique about it (unless you consider rednecks with poor house keeping skills menacing and unique). Leatherface's basement dungeon is appropriately dank, but again, another cliche' devised to generate disgust from the audience.5. Finally....HUMOR! The original was filled with darkly disturbing yet unbelievebly funny dialogs and one liners! Examples include: The headcheese speech, "Look what your brother did to the door! Has he got no pride in his home!?", and "I never took more than one lick, they say. I did 60 in five minutes once. Say, coulda done more if the hook 'n' pull gang coulda gotten the beaves outa the way faster!", and "OOOOH, I, I, I thought you was in a hurry! hee hee ha ha!", and various other instances where the dad would refer to Leatherface and the hitchhiker as knit-whit half-whit and coon s***! Also, the dinner scene whitch was sorely lacking from the remake. The remake's only 'comic' relief came from the great R. Lee Erney during the scene where he was taking the hitchhiker girl's body off the hands of the main characters. But even that scene seemed to me as if the writers were trying a bit too hard. It was crudely sexual, and disgusting, generating laughs out of embarrasment rather than true dark humor where the laughs are generated from a sence of how twisted the situation is and how lightly the characters are relating to it.I could go on and on about how TCM(2003) doesn't deserve to share the same name with it's classic predecessor, but if I did, I'd run out of space. It saddens me to know that there is a generation of horror movie fans who have not seen the original, yet have seen this turkey and believe that they have in fact seen The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I do not reccomend this film to anyone except on the grounds of what not to with a remake. If you want to see a great remake of a classic horror, rent David Cronenberg's 1986 remake of The Fly or even the 1988 remake of The Blob (for the special effects anyway). Avoid the jumbled mess that is TCM(2003).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*WARNING: SOME SPOILERS CONTAINED IN HERE* Just for the record, this is NOT a remake of the 1973 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The 2003 movie takes the events from the original movie, and expands on them.My Review: I have seen the 1973 TCM, and i just saw the 2003 TCM. Both disturbing and scary. The 2003 movie begins with our characters (Erin, Andy, Morgan, Pepper and Kemper) travelling across texas to a rock concert. After nearly running a young girl down on a quiet country road, they decide to stop and offer some assistance. The girl, clearly confused and terrified, mutters something about "They're all dead..". The group, curious as to whats going on, offer to take her to a hospital, but the young girl begs not to go back (we find out where later) and she trys to grab the steering wheel. after a struggle, the young girl promptly removes a pistol hidden in her clothing, and shoots herself. The Group, shaken up, try and call for help, where they are told to go to an abandoned mill. There, Erin and Kemper go off looking for some help, and they come across the Hewitt house. From there, it all goes wrong, and the group fall victim to a sadistic killer. Leatherface. Prepare for some shocks and scares.Admittedly, the film isnt amazing as compared to the 1973 film. Its shot slickly and smoothly.. and doesnt have that raw effect that made Tobe Hoopers film so disturbing and shocking. But all is not at loss. the 2003 TCM packs some scares and leaves you with a disturbed feeling afterwards. There are loads of dark claustrophobic moments, surprises and twists. But saying that, it is one of the more scarier horror films of recent years. The cast were young and beautiful (cliché of horror movies), but there was very little done on developing the characters. But all in all, worth watching and a true gem for fans of the horror genre. Forget the original when you see it.**** out of 5 *'s</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the original, and this movie was a good retelling of it. Very disturbing, sometimes overly so, this movie had a bit more depth than the original (which can be good or bad, depending on how you look at it). The characters had motives.The only complaints I have are that Leatherface took his mask off, and they tried to explain his psychosis.Where the original had a more realistic snuff-film feel, this is definitely "hollywood-ized", although I think that's in no way a problem. If the original was realistic, this is an incredibly nightmarish version. The lighting, characters, costumes, settings... everything about it is like something right out of a nightmare. Especially the scene where the character comes up to the slaughterhouse in the second half seemed to have an over-the-top and almost surreal feeling.I loved it, and if you go in with an open mind, you will to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I originally had my doubts for this one. As of late, horror movies have become mediocre gore fests with little suspense. The genre has practically formed a mold for itself. Especially with the release of FREDDY VS. JASON and JEEPERS CREEPERS 2 back in August, and the horribly disappointing COLD CREEK MANOR in Sept, knowing that TCM was next, I wasn't so sure what to expect.Another fact that occured to me that raised even more doubts was the fact that the original TCM, while scary and disturbing in its own right, was a very simple story. Not much to expand off of, or at least not in a direction that would not upset fans of the original.While I had my doubts, I had to see what the filmakers came up with, and much to my surprise they did a darn good job. Hands down, this has to be one of the best horror flicks to come around in a long time...with the exception of THE RING (which might I add shared its creepy kid with MASSACRE). This movie is so much fun to watch. Unlike most horror movies, the characters are dimensional, and the acting is pretty good, not to over or under played.Although from the start we can pick out who is going to die and who is going to live, this film carries a lot of suspense with it. It is one of the first in a long while where the audience in unison screams.Now for those who complain that Leatherface has been too much updated and the fact that this movie exposes his face and gives him a skin disease, losen your panties. This remake took some holes that were not filled in the first one (such as why Leatherface is the way he is) and used them to their advantage. The kill/chase scenes are great and you just do not want to close your eyes.I was ultimately pleasantly surprised, and praise the filmakers for actually producing a remake with character, and not just a cheap scam for money. Truly a thought out and wonderfully put together flick, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE allowed me to have more fun in a movie than I had had in a long time, and thus rates a 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When earlier this year I first heard they were going to remake the classic horror film The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I was to say the least, offended, and disgusted. I mean how dare they have the audacity to remake such a classic? So last night I didnt have much else to do so I reluctantly purchased two tickets for myself &amp; my girlfriend, because she wanted to see it since it is the number 1 movie right now. I went in expecting to hate it and concerned that I might fall asleep of boredom. Man was I wrong! WOW! it was a great movie, I definately got my moneys worth. Its actually very similar to the original movie, only a few things are changed and this movie might also remid alot of people of Rob Zombies House of 1000 Corpses, but just remember that Zombies film (according to Zombie himself) was heavily influenced by the original TCM. Im really not sure if alot of these people who are posting comments about TCM (2003)actually saw the same movie as I did. How could they not like it? Another poster commented (incorrectly) that TCM (2003) was not like the original because leatherface lived with a whole familly of backwoods inbred/ deliverence-like nuts. Well that poster obviously never saw the original TCM or he left before the ending. The strong points of the film in my opinion are the characters. There are lots of distict memorable characters in this film to keep anyone interested. Primarlily the sherrif of course (The same guy who played the drill SGT in full metal jacket). He is awesome and makes every bit of the impression as his drill sgt roll. Another strong point is that Leatherface was true to the original, he looks EXACTLY like the original leatherface. Again, for those who say this leather face is completely diffferent, I would just have to ask. Which movies did they see? Did they actually see TCM 1974 &amp; TCM 2003? The hitchiker at the beggining this time is a female instead of a male and this scene is VERY DISTURBING! and kind of sets the mood for the rest of the film. But thats why we see horror films, we want to be disturbed. I went in a huge fan of the original and really expected to hate this remake, but I can honestly say its every bit as good a film as the original TCM if not, better. Probably for the younger people TCM 2003 will be a much better film because obviously it was made on a larger budget and was made to keep up with the pace of the current horror/ slasher films. The original TCM was the first of its kind so we have to appreciate what it was for its time, but it really doesnt compare to this film in terms of shear horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than The Trailer Made It Out To Be...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...Dont get me wrong, i thought the Trailer was INCREDIBLE best Trailer i've seen for a film in a while, which surprised me considering i usually like Trailers with all that Fast Techno Like music and Running and Screaming throughout, but this Trailer seemed to amaze me, and so did the movie. I dont think a movie has ever truly scared me such as this one has, i was in my seat shivering and biting my nails, so much that my chair kept squeeking everytime i moved. It's not like i was afraid to go to sleep that night or anything, but it just truly scared me in a way no other film has been able to do in a long time.~Spoilers Throughout~The plot centers around five people on their way to a Big Concert, everything seems all right until a certain Hitch Hiker comes into their life, not only does she looks tired and depressed but she's bleeding badly, and looks as though she's been outside walking for days, sooner or later things go to far and the poo girl takes a gun out and shoots herself through the mouth, little do the other teens know, this is only the beginning as an innocent trip to an old house in the middle of nowhere goes wrong, they realize they're being hunted one by one, and everyone seems to be out for them...The acting in this was really good, i was surprised by Jessica Biel, this film has proved that she can act, hope to see her in more Horror Films to come. Erica Leerhsen, i can't get enough of her, she has this beauty to her that NOBODY can match, she is an incredible actress, and has looks to boot, she'll go far. Mike Vogel was really good, i'd only seen him on Grounded For Life a few times, and his acting reaklly shwon through with this film, as for the others (I forget there names) they were all really good, all the friends, family members, locals everyone did an awesome job and i'm sure we'll be seeing more of them soon enough.The blood and gore factor was up there, it wasn't a splatter fest, but it did have it's moments with a chopped off leg, a mallot to the head, a chainsaw up the middle region, some heads, and flesh being peeled off a corpse. As graphic as it may sound it was easy to handle, although looked very real, it was able to be handled easily without feeling uneasy, although i felt uneasy about the movie overall.Seeing this movie was a great experience, it opened the doors to Horror i think, much like Scream Revamped the Horror Genre this opened the doors for many more Horror Films to come, this was very well executed, it made you feel very uncomfortable and thats the real joy in seeing this, just going into the dark theater and knowing that you can scream your head off, and coming out completely and utterly amazed, i give this film a 10/10 it had everything, is Erica Leerhsen had lasted maybe all the way to the end, it would have been better, but either way this movie was great, loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to comment on this film, not only because it was terrible but because it was number one at the box office. I am very happy that it was number one, but for only one reason, it makes horror movies look better to studios so in turn there will be more produced. But that is the only good thing to be said about this trash. This movie is not even close to being what the original was, which is not a bad thing, because who really expected it to be? But then there was the whole issue of it ripping off every movie that ripped off the original, now whats the point of that? I mean everyone will slam all the other copycats of the original but this one will be praised, how fair is that? I mean this one is really just a sequel to the first because NOTHING is the same, no lie, even Leatherface is diffrent. Now I understand that they wanted to make the movie more accessable toteens, who haven't seen the original, but did they really need to make thecharacters as retarded as they are? I felt 20 points dumber after seeing this movie, when you see the beginning of the film you will see what I'm saying. Also this film actually steals from House of 1000 Corpses, by makingLeatherface part of an entire living family, of wackos. But the thing is House actually worked, and did what it wanted to do, leave you disturbed. The newTexas, will leave you in awe of how pathetic it is. I mean granted they throw in some gore but it never disturbs, just makes you go ouch that musta sucked. But big ups to Jessica Beil who almost made it watchable, she has a great scenewith her friend hung on a hook. Overall,this would have been fun if it werecalled Texas Chainsaw Massacre 5. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad as a re-make but could have been much better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Texas Chainsaw MassacreI am not a great fan of remakes because no matter how well they are made, they can never match the originality of the first movie. This re-make of the 1973 cult classic is no exception to this rule. Having said that, I must add that this project is not a disappointment after all. There are many parts in this re-make that work better than in the original, like camera-shots and special effects, due to more advanced shooting techniques and a better budget. Unfortunately, those good parts lose their effect as they are overshadowed by some very bad screenplay writing. If those screenplay writers didn't overkill the story with too much exaggeration and reveal the suspense pre-maturely they could better satisfy the audience. SPOILER ALERT:The movie begins with a documentary footage giving us some background on the bizarre events that befell the five unfortunate youngsters. We are taken back to August 18, 1973 the day the gruesome murders took place. They pick up a hitch-hiker who, unlike in the original, is a female character and a victim. The hitch-hiker character's pulling a gun right out of her crotch and shooting herself is a terribly stupid idea and one bad piece of screenplay writing. Are we supposed to believe that the gun was up there all that time?while she was walking? And why would she decide to use the gun after she gets in the van, and not before? Did her life get any worse after she got in the van? I think this part, even though it plays a leading role in the following chain of events, was the most problematic part of the screenplay. It is revealed pre-maturely that there is something wrong with the sheriff. It would have been much more clever if his character was not so exaggerated and the signs of his insanity were made to be more subdued. This way, audience would have been unsuspicious against his wickedness, that could come as a big surprise in the end. The role written for him is too exaggerated to convey any sense of reality. Almost every scene where LEATHERFACE makes his appearance works superbly well, delivering serious chills (the chase scene through the sheets, the hide-out scene in the barracks, and the scenes in the factory). There is one outstanding scene where LeatherFace looks like someone terrifyingly familiar in an unanticipated moment. That was brilliant and damn spooky! On the other hand, showing LeatherFace without his mask, even for a few seconds, was a very bad idea as it kind of ruins his image. I find the design of the slaughter-room much more effective than in the original film. It is much bigger, almost like another house in itself, creating depth. The slaughter-room in the original film was too small, without adequate space. This slaughter-room makes some new scenes possible, creating more tension. We also see more details of this section of the house, even where LeatherFace is sewing his masks (a reminiscent of the scene from The Silence Of The Lambs). We are made suspicious, again too soon, of the characters in the trailer where Erin finds haven, without leaving any chance for sudden surprise.The dramatic scene where Erin is forced to kill Andy works emotionally but not logically. I mean you can feel the tension there as she brings herself to stab him but she stabs him in the stomach which shouldn't produce a fast kill. This re-make is gory and BLOODY, at most times, in an inelegant way, which I didn't care for.The scene where Erin makes an irrational decision and runs to slaughter factory was a bad idea (why would you run to a slaughter factory while you are being chased by a maniac with a chainsaw?) Yet, she runs quite fast without any hesitation as if she knows her destination. But the most stupid part is that Leatherface catches up with her almost instantly. We all know that LeatherFace is not a good runner; he hardly catches up with his victims in his good health unless they falter themselves. Now he is badly injured too. Besides, Erin has made an advance on the distance between them while he was down. Yet, he shows up in the factory in no time. When Erin is back to the gas station, we see some of the family members and a character from the trailer in the gas station. Do these people keep moving around, from one location to another all the time? There are three locations, the gas station, the house and the trailer but the characters keep popping up in all of these locations in a short period of time as if they constantly move from one location to another. Then we have one of the most non-sense scenes in the movie: we see Erin trying to short-circuit start the truck while sheriff, unaware of her location, slowly approaches to the driver's side. The sheriff opens the door, and to our surprise, Erin appears all of sudden driving in sheriff's car, running him over. We are supposed to believe that Erin left the truck, went over to the sheriff's car, started the car, and drove to the truck's location without a sound in?what?.5 seconds? Or are we supposed to believe that it took sheriff a good 5 minutes to walk from the front of the truck to the driver's side? The film ends with the documentary footage again, an idea reminiscent of the idea from the Blair Witch Project, where the police conducting the gathering of evidence on tape gets attacked by Leatherface. Can cops be so unprepared that they become sitting ducks in an evidence gathering session in the crime scene? Overall, this re-make wasn't very bad as a horror movie but it was pretty bad in the sense that it ruins its own good ideas with some amateurish screenplay writing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the attempt to remake the original in 1974 was almost complete, however, instead of trying to tell more a story, the writers decided to add in more gore then the original. The story wasn't as good, nor was the infamous 'leatherface', he somehow seemed scarier in the original. Overall, i guess it was okay, not the greatest...but...a decent enough film to rent..but not see in the theatres..unless you have a pass or something...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not going to write an essay here like some have chosen to do, but this is a good horror movie. It is not better than the original, but it is better than any other TCM up to this point. It has some pretty good acting and the best part is that it is not campy. It really tries to convey that there is some bad stuff going down. If I had to complain about something it would be the editing. It is cut so fast that it is often hard to tell what is going on at times. A worthy tribute, but I would have shot it with an old cheap camera to give it that old-school realistic look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Macabre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been many bad reviews about this new version of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (TCM-2003). Critics all over the country seemed to have been offended by the explicit content of this film. I think what is happening here is that they are forgetting that this is a true horror film. What's expected of a movie that has the words `chainsaw' and `massacre' in it? Definitely not laughs or relaxedness, on the contrary, tension, nerves and fear. Isn't that what we all expect to get from a horror film? I did not live the 70s, but probably when the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre (TCM) was released it caused the same controversy and reactions as the new one is doing. This is a genre that many directors have lost respect for, by creating many stereotypical movies at the start of the 90s and so on. There have been many attempts to create a good horror film since? and where the rest have failed, TCM-2003 is triumphant.I am a fan of this genre and have seen many horror films from different times, since the 50s to today. As a film enthusiast I like to see the evolution of film-making, in particular the horror genre. I do not mean to put down TCM; like many fans I think it is a great horror film, it has become a classic, but let's be realistic, it does not offer the same emotions that TCM-2003 delivers. Like many of us know TCM has some classic scenes: leatherface's dance, the dinner scene, the eye close-ups and some others. But instead of being horrifying it becomes humorous in its own sick-demented way thanks to the great, unforgettable performance by Jim Siedow (the old man//boss of the clan), who is my favorite character in TCM.TCM-2003 is raw and powerful. The cinematography is splendid and the acting is also good. The sheriff does a great job, reminiscent of his past history in Full Metal Jacket. The film shows no mercy, is creepy, obscure and full of anger. The setting is also very good; the atmosphere in the house is so thick that it can almost feel as if one was there. Leatherface is truly frightening; his acts are macabre and grotesque.Overall, TCM-2003 contains all the elements to make it one of the best movies in horror-film history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's Roadkill All Over Texas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The easiest way to put down the 2003 remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is to compare it to original 1974 classic and to point out the utter futility of trying to top that film. When the original film came out, people were not sure quite what to make of it and it danced in the shadows of obscurity and distribution problems for quite some time. But it eventually picked up momentum and has come to be one of the main markers of the horror genre. When the remake was announced, the buzz of controversy began immediately. How dare anyone think of remaking such a classic, the common consensus seemed to read. Many pointed out that the film was sure to fail, artistically and financially. Well, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre opened to wide release on October 17th 2003 and over the weekend became the number one film in America. It exceeded the already-high expectations of box office officials and amazed a lot of people who had felt sure it would bomb. But while the film fared well financially, how does it hold up as a piece of film making? Well, as a fan of the original and someone who has supported the remake along the way, I must say that it does and it doesn't. Yes, the original was sort of brilliant. But a lot of it's greatness came by accident from the utter poverty of the production. The house was real (it was rented from a rural Texas family). A lot of the blood on the protagonist's outfit was real from running and falling for take after take. And it was really gritty. It's kind of hard to breathe while watching that movie the first few times. It was a little exploitation sickie that somehow stumbled into becoming a masterpiece and a lot of it was due to the off-the-cuff way it was made. But considering that film's infamy, you can be sure that the film makers who set out to do it again had a few more dollars and lot more expensive fake blood. This film was directed by Marcus Nispel (pictured next page left), a music video director who is getting a shot on this movie courtesy of producer Michael Bay (next page right). Bay, who directed Bad Boys (1995), it's sequel and other big bang flicks such as Armageddon (1998) and Pearl Harbor (2001), has expressed interest in giving music video directors a shot at the big time since Bay himself was one in the past. The problem is that while Bay might have seen something in Nispel, I am not sure if Nispel saw anything in The Texas Chainsaw project placed before him. Because while the movie does have the bare ingredients of the original it doesn't have the feeling that it was brought to the screen by someone who had a love for it. Take, for example, that there is no dinner scene here, a scene made infamous by the original and it's sequels. This, of course, is the part in the movie where the victim is forced to sit through a hellish dinner while she is tortured by the family of killers. Or take for example that here Leatherface is not a retarded man with a disturbed mind but instead a cold, heartless killer in the same vein as Michael Meyers and Jason Voorhees. These are essential elements that any decent fan of the original would have immediately inked into the script. But they are nowhere to be found. And what of the `chainsaw dance' that Leatherface executed in every one of the previous films, his riveting dance of frustration in which he spun and cavorted with his saw. One snap of the director's fingers and these problems would have been fixed faster than a chainsaw cuts through Kleenex. And what of the house, which looks as if it were assembled from large wooden boxes all stacked up. Or any of the sets in this film for that matter. The original was filmed on location in houses that really existed and still do in Texas. (One was moved to another state sometime over the years.) Geographically, the houses were at the same locations represented in the film. That was what gave the film half of its authenticity. Here, the characters are just running through a lot of movie sets. Fortunately, sometimes a good cast and a great cinematographer can wrestle a film away from an incompetent director long enough to give an otherwise dispensable picture some merit. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) is a textbook example of this. Jessica Biel, best known thus far for her role on the WB network's 7th Heaven (a show many dismissed but I always enjoyed), is one hell of a horror heroine as she slices, dices and runs over whoever gets in her way. It's surprising that she pulls a decent performance out of a script that gave her little to start with. And this goes for the rest of the cast. Jonathan Tucker, Erica Leerhsen, Mike Vogel and Eric Balfour are equally exceptional as the other victims and each brings at least some semblance of a fresh vibe to worn out stock characters from a secondhand screenplay. But when all is said, the real applause goes to Daniel Pearl, the cinematographer who lensed the original classic and returns here to save the day. He keeps the low angles and superb tracking shots of the 1974 film but also manages to elicit a considerable amount of queer beauty from the rural Texas locations. He makes a cookie-cutter Hollywood haunted house into a disturbing thing of nightmares. The summer sunlight shoots through the trees with a celestial glow that makes the whole thing work while Nispel is busy with Latex masks and buckets of blood. In 1994, Kim Henkel, one of the creators of the original, got a chance to do his own Chainsaw film and it's sad that Pearl did not get his chance with this one. If he can do so much from his limited position on this film it's a wonder to think what the picture would have been like had he been slated to direct. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is the stuff of American legend and it dwells in our subconscious in ways at once unsettling and fascinating. There is no reason why no new Chainsaw films should be made so though I am not completely happy with this remake I am in no way against what it sets out to do which is to bring the old story to new generations. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre films remind us of the flaws in American life that nest beneath society but also affect it. They are a series of bold nightmares that are difficult to endure and even harder to forget. But the problem with Marcus Nispel's film is that it tells the story with a lot less quality and with a lot of the essential elements missing. It's true that Nispel's film is far more graphic than the original but it's like someone telling you the story of Hansel and Gretel with all the gross bits expanded upon but much of the effect gone. You walk away grossed out and with the basic parts all in place but something is missing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*mild spoilers*Maybe writing this will be therapy........I sure hope so cause I just got back from the movie and I need to get to bed.As a whole, I thought it was outstanding. It's the first time in a long time I can remember seeing a horror movie and being genuinely disturbed. There were at least 3 or 4 times I actually considered walking out of the theatre. It is that intense at times. Not really gory, it's the psychological aspects that got to me. Like when the kid is being dragged down the stairs minus a leg, totally helpless, not knowing what terror lies ahead of him. You could just feel the hopelessness these people were feeling.I see a lot of people bagging on this movie......mostly in comparison to the first. WoW! Way to take a stand people. Of course it wont compare to the first because it isn't the original. I saw the first a long time ago, and like many on here was blown away. But if you had no prior knowledge and it was released today it would be dated. Sorry but it would. I think its a great idea to do the remake with modern filmaking, it gives those who never saw the first a chance to appreciate an original idea. Things change over time and usually for the better. I liken it to athletics....Babe Ruth is aknowledged as the greatest baseball player ever but if he were playing today Barry Bonds would make him look like 3rd string minor leaguer.All in all, it's an outstanding horror movie. The acting for the genre is perfect all the way around. The performances give off a sense of terror at the insanity surrounding the characters. Their fear and dread comes off as such instead of the expected mindless screaming we usually get. I recommend it.........but it isn't easy to sit thru.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New Version Vs. Original (Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie last night, and I must say, as a fan of horror movies, it was pretty good. I enjoyed the jump scenes, and I thought Beil's acting was pretty darn good. I was a teenager when I saw the original on video, and I'll never forget how terrified I felt during that final scene with chainsaw-wielding Leatherface fast on the heels of that hysterical woman running toward the truck. Having seen both, I think I prefer the original, for two reasons. I felt Leatherface in the original was played with a lot more flair. He was clumsy and bumbling, yet acted like that chainsaw was a natural part of his arm. To me, he was just a lot scarier and crazier than the "new" Leatherface. I felt like I understood the original Leatherface more than this guy, who was pretty anonymous. Also, the new Leatherface could run like the wind, and I felt he just didn't have as much pizazz. Secondly, while many people will note this as a positive thing, in this version the viewer knows all along that the Beil character will survive. She is smart, tough, and keeps her head throughout the whole movie. There is no doubt she will beat Leatherface, and in all honesty, to me this took a little bit of the edge off the scariness. In the original, the woman who survives makes it out of pure luck -- she is totally hysterical, and her fear is raw -- one of the things that made that movie so scary, I thought.This could spark a huge discussion on feminism and the difference in the decades on the portrayal of women in horror films, but I mention this issue only on a "fear" basis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To be honest, it was more than i had expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i first saw the trailer for Texas Chainsaw Massacre, i figured it would be decent at best, for horror movies today truly lack the horror concept in them. Unbeknowest to me, when i saw this movie, i was very pleased by the format and overall layout of the movie. I do not remember the original, for i wasnt even conceived when it first came out. But i think the director did a great job with it. The cast did a good job overall, although i wish that dude with glasses would of got canned early. I really enjoyed R Lee Ermie's performance though. He pretty much played a hard ass like he always does, but in this one he was the biggest dick i have ever seen. Hats off to him. I know movies now like to do the quick pans that sends a jolt through the watching crowd like a cold breeze and personally i thought they got old. Let me be the first to say that i actually DID jolt ever so slightly. If a movie can get me to jump, then it must be pretty damn good. In general, the movie just did good in all areas, from the murky and dark neighborhood, to the weird imbred like townsfolk. So if your lookin for a movie that actually might scare you, don't waste your time on some piece of s*** film like The Ring, (everyone told me it was the scariest film ever, i thought watching battlefield earth was way scarier) just go to your local movie theater and check out The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, i can assure you that you wont be dissapointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Hell of a Ride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is what more standard horror films should aspire to be like. Yes, it does have its share of gore but it's not gratuitous. A suspenseful horror film wants to have a balance between on and offscreen violence. If you always see the psycho with the chainsaw bearing down on his victims, you'll quickly become desensitized to the terror that inflicts. But, as a horror fan, you do want to see some decapitations and a fair share of blood. Director Marcus Nispel skillfully handles the material. He seems to come from the David Fincher/Michael Bay school of directing which involves elaborate camera manipulation, rapid-fire editing, a lot of steadicam work, seamless CGI and deft cinematography. A reinvention of a horror classic like TCM would demand an elevation in style otherwise it'd be hard to surpass the original. The 1973 version was so unexpected and controversial that audiences were practically appalled by its content. 21st century audiences are hard to faze so the film would need to be technically adept to keep its viewers interested. Nispel does not disappoint. The film is well-paced and builds in suspense to a great, unexpected climax. I liked the deviations from the original: the added Hewitt family members, the Leatherface backstory, the kidnapping subplot and the new ending. All the teenagers were good. Jessica Biel was especially impressive and looked truly terrified throughout the film but she also possessed nuances of determination and integrity which keep her three-dimensionality. Leatherface is an imposing figure and scary as hell. He's not portrayed as openly as in the original and therefore he comes off much more mysterious and ultimately more frightening. The new TCM is a great time at the multiplex and definitely gives you your money's worth. Check it out if you like scary, stylish movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All right...Here it goes.... I am not denying the fact that the movie itself didn't have a few "Holy Crap!" moments, because when I saw this movie just tonight, I did jump up and gasp a few times. What really got to me was the acting...talk about terrible. The acting just made the movie bad...especially Jessica Biel...I'm not saying that she is not a good actress, because I've seen her in other roles and she does a good job, but she is just not the Damsel in Distress type.Another thing that mainly bothered me was how the movie just dragged on and on and on. Now, as I said before, there were parts that made you jump, but the movie could have ended 20 minutes before it actually did. At the end, where Jessica Biel was trapped in the meat factory with "Leatherface" I was seriously sitting there saying "Please, just kill her already so I can home".And what was with Mike Vogel's character and how he never died! I mean he only got his leg chopped off by a chainsaw and impaled on a hook! Everytime they cut to a scene where he was in it I kept saying "He's still alive????"Now, if you want a cheap thrill, then I say go see this movie, because you will certainly get it...but you could also spend 2 dollars renting "I Know What You Did Last Summer" too. Don't waste 6 dollars on this movie...if you really really want to see it...wait until it comes out on video, because it's seriously not worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many other users have commented on the fact that this is a remake and todays movie makers are just lazy. COME ON!! When was the last time Hollywood put out an original movie? Every movie tells the same story. How many times have we seen a movie about stupid kids and a crazy freak that likes to kill them......just about every horror movie. (scream, ring, the hills have eyes...on and on) This version of Texas Chainsaw was well done and told the story much better than the original. We all knew that the is a "remake" so if you are opposed to that don't go. Figure it out people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the movie itself was above average for a modern horror film it has lost the feel, the style that made it different from every other horror movie. "Who will survive and what will be left of them?" doesn't really seem to apply any longer. The sense that this version brings about is the redefinition of a failed franchise. I don't believe that the origional film was really qualified to be the beginning of a franchise and if that is the goal for the new film, it may be adaquate. This film will probably be enjoyed more by newcomers than by fans of the origional.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was OK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This newest version of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre was OK. I don't believe that without the previous four movies that this would even be in theaters, though. The first thing I noticed that I didn't like about the movie was the camera technique. It seemed like the cameras were always in someone's face and not giving a wide enough view of the scene. This can sometimes create a disorienting effect which makes the movie hard to watch. Another thing was the scenery. The inside of the house looked too dirty, too inhuman, too dark. I would like to contrast this with the scenery of TCM3: Leatherface. The scenery in Leatherface looked realistic, like the set wasn't built just for a movie. The inside of the Sawyer's house in Leatherface was clean, but strewn with body parts, to make the scene surreal and spooky all at the same time. In Leatherface, there is a hero, which I think both the new and the original TCM's need. All throughout the movie I was waiting for the big black guy with the M-16 to make an appearance. Perhaps my biggest gripe with this movie is what all horror movies use way too much nowadays....cheap scares. You know, where the orchestra builds up and then something jumps out and is either harmless or chops the helpless victim's head off. This effect gets old after the fourth or fifth time.All in all, it's a decent movie, but not destined to become one of my classics. "Leatherface" is where the series begins and ends with me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well - I was hoping it would be good, but seriously, it stunk. I'd definetly say, without a doubt, that it was the worst movie I've seen all year. My biggest issue is that I couldn't stand the liberties that they've taken by saying 'Inspired by' rather that 'Based on'. You know the facts. 5 teenagers got killed by some guy called Leatherface with a chainsaw in Texas - the presence of these characters are about the only reason that they can claim the 'inspiration' because the rest of the movie is just plain ludicrous. I can't see how any more than 25% of this flick, and the scenes in it could have been based off fact. It followed the typical horror movie format, with typical horror movie scares, and typical horror movie gore. Nothing was scary about it, it was entirely all predictable. Save your cash, don't go see it, don't rent it, don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are two ways to look at this film: 1) as a remake of an original classic, and 2) as its own separate entity. If you look at it as a remake of the original, it is sorely disappointing. Many things were changed, and a lot of the more 'disturbing' aspects of the first movie were left out or merely hinted at (i.e. the cannibalism). This could be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it. However, if you look at this movie as its own being, it's very decent. The director seemed to have a fair amount of respect for the story and managed to make a horror/slasher pic that is better than most things Hollywood has thrown out lately. There is not a single "Matrix"-style fight scene (I am VERY, VERY insulted by any movie that is NOT the "Matrix" that utilizes said effects), and the plot moves along fairly smoothly with out too many unbelievable plot twists. As a fan of the original cult-classic, I was entertained by this movie. But again, if you see it expecting a true remake of the original, you will be sorely disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit that when I heard they were going to remake this film, I was dead set against it. For a horror fan, this was like they were going to remake Casablanca or Citizen Kane.Then the early buzz came in and it was mostly positive, so I decided to go see it.I must say, I was very pleasantly surprised.It was not a direct remake, but more of a retelling. There were some scenes directly from the movie, but most of it was new.*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***There were a few things that I did not like.1. Why oh why did they have to show Leatherface's actual face AND give him something of a backstory? There is no need for this. In the original, he was simply a maniac and that was it.2. They could not help themselves but fall into typical "teen slasher" mode. They take Jessica Biel, make her run around in a tank top for the whole movie. Then they drop her in water so you can see through the t-shirt and then they top it off by putting her in a cold slaughterhouse! I did not mind seeing Jessica Biel in a tank top, but if I want to see that sort of thing, I don't look for it in what is supposed to be a terrifying movie!*** END OF SPOILERS ***Overall, it was much better than I thought it would be. Just keep it seperate from the original and you will enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Revised</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I'm writing this it is just ten days away from Halloween, my favorite holiday of the entire year. Each weekend in October for me is spent perusing the aisles in my local video store for great horror titles or anxiously awaiting the release of a good horror movie. Usually I'm very disappointed with Halloween releases because they do not often include horror films. This year, however, the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre was the only worthwhile horror movie in theatres anywhere.I generally scorn and mock re-makes especially of classics like TCM, but in this case will make an exception. After sitting through the nauseating House of the Dead and an excruciating rental of Wrong Turn, I'm giving the revised TCM a thumbs up for gore, violence and all around good tension. I also happened to check it out at the drive-in, the ONLY place to view such a trashy horror flick. I have a feeling the slick visuals would have played over the top in theatres. But on the outdoor screen, listening through tinny drive-in speakers, I found my experience to be quite what I'd been looking for this Halloween season.Now for the tally. First off, the new TCM lacks in originality, as all re-makes and sequels do, and points should be taken away immediately for that. It features WB actors, subtract more points. The film is not shot on 16mm, like the original, so the scenes looked more comfortable than not for the actors. Again with the subtraction. They also give us a pathetic back story of Leatherface and show us what he looks like underneath. One should NEVER identify with, or pity Leatherface. It's just plain wrong. Removing more points.After hearing director's commentary for the first (and greatest) TCM, we know shooting in the Texas heat was hell for everyone on set. The extreme conditions intensified performances and added genuine sweat to the brows of the actors. TCM 'The Revision' never ceases to remind us that the lovely Jessica Biel is probably offset between takes sipping Evian and doing stomach crunches. The camera can't get over her incredible physique and loves shooting her in longshot. Seriously, if those low-rise jeans got any lower we'd know her as well as her own gynecologist. But keep up those crunches Jess, because YOU are lookin' GOOD, girl!But this leads me to a subject now near and dear to my heart. There's a new phenomena in Hollywood; apparently it is illegal to show a woman as powerless. Perhaps it's due to the criticism of feminists all over the planet who aren't so thrilled with Hollywood's victimization of women. They think now in every film, women should reign supreme and all-powerful when in reality, this is often not the case. I wish folks with these ideals would leave the horror industry alone, because they're ruining the entire idea of what terror is all about. There HAS to be a victim in horror films or there is no fright. Does it matter if the woman is the victim? Who cares? Leatherface does not discriminate, people! Hollywood is intent now on showing women as extraordinarily unbelievable heroic figures on principal, tragically crippling the horror movie industry. Women, in life, ARE victims of MANY, MANY tragedies. So are old ladies and babies. Not everyone out there kick-boxes, yo! Jessica Biel's character's ability to hotwire a car and outsmart Leatherface makes this remake a lesser movie. The character seems more contrived and the action less frightening because we know she'll make it in the end. Where's the horror in that? Subtract even more points for this politically correct bull. If feminists are so concerned with women's roles in films, why aren't they policing the porn industry where their help is really needed.The greatest thing about the original TCM was the extreme terror-stricken performance of Marilyn Burns. Her Sally ran circles around Biel's character in sheer essence. You felt Sally's fear because you identified with her. She seemed to be an ordinary person in an incredibly surreal situation. You could identify with her plight. Trust me, if Leatherface was chasing you would you honestly lure him to your hiding place thinking a butcher knife would would protect you against a CHAINSAW? Cha-ching, robbing more points.With all this aside, I can't give the movie a bad review. This revised version of Texas Chainsaw Massacre offered up enough gore and chills to hold my interest. It played great at the drive-in on a Friday night. It will never be as great as the classic, but the story--even told a second time--is so insane you want to hear it again. So watching a newer version was not so bad. It was what's great about drive-in movies. It will never be the original, but it's much better than a lot of the other crap Hollywood's trying to pass off as horror these days, so go ahead. Cheat your principals and see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the younger audience, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre delivers everything we want. Most of us haven't even seen the original, so there's no use even comparing the two to most of us. I really liked the movie, not only because it was an edge-of-your-seat thriller, but also because of the way the directors make you feel as if you are actually in that little Texas town. Jessica Biel's character was actually smart, making all the wise moves we hope we would make if we were in that situation! These actors weren't the stock, mass-produced horror film characters. I would definitely recommend seeing this movie if you're a teen (and even if you're not). But head into the theater knowing that you're not going to experience a life-changing lesson...you're just in for a good, long overdue scare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Bay and the old classic horror movie 'The Texas Chainsaw Massarce" being reimagined for a new generation to experience. Many people cringe when they se Michael Bay's name on anything cause his products are empty movies with amazing visuals. Can his horror movies be any different then the other stuff he has put out on the public??....All right, I never saw the orginal so I couldn't compare this to that, but I am glad cause I find that people base their opinions on old films when they get redone do not enjoy the film to the fullest cause their heads are clogged with comparing This movie is definately a good reimagining of the story of a maniac who swings a chainsaw and his nutcase family. Leatherface definately has alot of screen presence, when he is on screen he owns it. You can chills down the spine just by looking at him before he does anything sadistic. His family are just astwisted, especially the sheriff who at times make the movie seem very twisted and dark. Since that is the angle they are going for they succeed. But what they screw up is the cliches and the pacing of the story. Your basic horror elements are here such as noises, people popping out of now where, the idiot teens and the classic creepy gas station that is at the beginning of town. Now, these aren't bad cause they are all elements that make a movie creepy but after a while you just get tired and can know what the movie is going to show you after awhie. The pacing of the story seemed just to get to the violence, wespend the first hald hour getting to know the characters who are very idiotic and uniteresting but are wonderfully played as best as they could. We never get to know that much about anybody besides he is the murder and they are the prey. Jessica Biel, I must admit does a bang up job as the lead female, this girl has a set of lungs on her and gives her character a sense of courage that most horror films do not award girls. But if you do not dig deep into movies like this and only are interested in if you will be scared out of your seat. The answer is yes, this movie is quite good at making you feel freaked out and scared at the sametime. In final words this movie is a good teenage slasher film cause it takes its horror seriously but can not help cliches. Go to the movie at 12 at night and pay the money, you won't regret it cause when in the lone parking lot you will feel jittery.....B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't waste your money on haunted houses for a Halloween scare, SEE THIS MOVIE!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose I'm one of the few who have yet to see the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but with that said, this was the best horror film I've seen in...maybe ever. The acting was so much better than I expected. I can't begin to count the number of times I jumped, cringed and gasped. And from what I heard and saw around me, I wasn't alone!! It's scary, it's gory and it's a great ride...if you can take it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What cinematic blasphemy to re-make a cult classic!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>!!!Another film I'm adding to my "Worst Films of 2003" list!!If today's generation is too LAZY to rent the orginial and Hollywood is too LAZY and money hungry to re-release the orginial 1974 film then don't re-make a cult classic!! IT's pointless and stupid and turns Tobe Hopper into a joke and a hack director hanging on too fading glory!!What cinematic blasphemy to re-make a cult classic, what next a re-make of "Alien"!!This watered-down, MTV-generation horror movie is nowhere near as clever or scary as it thinks it is. It's just cheesy . . . but not in a good way.It took "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" about 15 minutes before all my anticipation was completely stripped away and replaced with utter boredom. Instead of figuring out a way of reinventing the film for a new generation, it merely spends most of its time simply restaging many of the key moments from the earlier film!!(Another one of the keys to the original was the fact that, for all of its supposed carnage, there is almost no on-screen blood or violence on display-Hooper suggested it so expertly with his editing and sound effects that the mind created more mayhem than there actually was in the final product!!!Did Tobe Hopper need to make his housepayment that bad to allow a re-make??!?.The most idiotic "improvement" in "TCM" has to do with the character of the infamous Leatherface. The reason he became an instant horror icon (besides his tendency to wear the skinned-off faces of his victims) was because he had no backstory to speak of; he was simply the bogeyman incarnate and would kill you in horrible ways for no other reason than the simple fact that you were standing in the wrong place at the wrong time. Here, the insane decision has been made to attempt to "humanize" the character to make his actions less inexplicable. Instead of being a faceless monster, we learn that his real name is Thomas Brown Hewitt and that he was driven to kill because as a child, he developed an ugly skin disease that caused the other kids to make fun of him!!First time director Marcus Nispel deserves the "Raseberry Award" for Worst director and then run out of Hollywood!!POINT-LESS RE_MAKE!!ADVENGE BAD RE-MAKES!!!The only logic at work in Marcus Nispel's strenuously literal-minded and unfunny re-make is economic. Take the brand-name title, strip the original of everything that made it buzz, crank up the gore and yuck factor, and sell it to an audience more likely to know Leatherface as an icon than a character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not to be watched if you live alone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently I got my own place and moved out of my parents' house. I set off into the big bad world to make my own and prove that I am an adult. After watching the TCM remake, I want to go back to my parents' house and hide.This is one of those truly scary horror movies that only come along once in a few years. I have read other reviews saying that it would be more like the Blair Witch Project than like other slasher films, and that is correct to an extent.There is a lot of psychological horror to this film, like in BWP or the Silence of the Lambs, but there is also plenty of gore. "How much gore" you say? I have never before seen a movie where the antagonist removes someone's face to replace his own horribly marred mug. But overall, there's still not that much gore.I have never seen the original TCM, and I probably never will. I would most likely only be disappointed. If you like a good make you jump ten feet out of your seat horror movie, this is the one for you. Just when you think it is over, you're wrong. They get you again.I suspect that in another year or so, we will see a remake of the TCM sequel. To the producers I say "Bring it on."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most people hate remakes, saying that they totally go against the original. I, for one, who had seen the original, must say that this one puts the 70's version to shame. There were many differences between the two, but this remake surpasses it with more frightening moments. The use of creepy and ominous music really sets the mood during the final half-hour. You will not be disappointed with this beautifully done remake. The second the hitchhiker is picked up, is when things really start to get going.Scale: 10/10</fullReview>

Especially the scene where Letherface rips the chainsaw through a sheet hanging on a clothes line only to cut off his victims leg.

		<shortDescription>Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Revised</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I'm writing this it is just ten days away from Halloween, my favorite holiday of the entire year. Each weekend in October for me is spent perusing the aisles in my local video store for great horror titles or anxiously awaiting the release of a good horror movie. Usually I'm very disappointed with Halloween releases because they do not often include horror films. This year, however, the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre was the only worthwhile horror movie in theatres anywhere.I generally scorn and mock re-makes especially of classics like TCM, but in this case will make an exception. After sitting through the nauseating House of the Dead and an excruciating rental of Wrong Turn, I'm giving the revised TCM a thumbs up for gore, violence and all around good tension. I also happened to check it out at the drive-in, the ONLY place to view such a trashy horror flick. I have a feeling the slick visuals would have played over the top in theatres. But on the outdoor screen, listening through tinny drive-in speakers, I found my experience to be quite what I'd been looking for this Halloween season.Now for the tally. First off, the new TCM lacks in originality, as all re-makes and sequels do, and points should be taken away immediately for that. It features WB actors, subtract more points. The film is not shot on 16mm, like the original, so the scenes looked more comfortable than not for the actors. Again with the subtraction. They also give us a pathetic back story of Leatherface and show us what he looks like underneath. One should NEVER identify with, or pity Leatherface. It's just plain wrong. Removing more points.After hearing director's commentary for the first (and greatest) TCM, we know shooting in the Texas heat was hell for everyone on set. The extreme conditions intensified performances and added genuine sweat to the brows of the actors. TCM 'The Revision' never ceases to remind us that the lovely Jessica Biel is probably offset between takes sipping Evian and doing stomach crunches. The camera can't get over her incredible physique and loves shooting her in longshot. Seriously, if those low-rise jeans got any lower we'd know her as well as her own gynecologist. But keep up those crunches Jess, because YOU are lookin' GOOD, girl!But this leads me to a subject now near and dear to my heart. There's a new phenomena in Hollywood; apparently it is illegal to show a woman as powerless. Perhaps it's due to the criticism of feminists all over the planet who aren't so thrilled with Hollywood's victimization of women. They think now in every film, women should reign supreme and all-powerful when in reality, this is often not the case. I wish folks with these ideals would leave the horror industry alone, because they're ruining the entire idea of what terror is all about. There HAS to be a victim in horror films or there is no fright. Does it matter if the woman is the victim? Who cares? Leatherface does not discriminate, people! Hollywood is intent now on showing women as extraordinarily unbelievable heroic figures on principal, tragically crippling the horror movie industry. Women, in life, ARE victims of MANY, MANY tragedies. So are old ladies and babies. Not everyone out there kick-boxes, yo! Jessica Biel's character's ability to hotwire a car and outsmart Leatherface makes this remake a lesser movie. The character seems more contrived and the action less frightening because we know she'll make it in the end. Where's the horror in that? Subtract even more points for this politically correct bull. If feminists are so concerned with women's roles in films, why aren't they policing the porn industry where their help is really needed.The greatest thing about the original TCM was the extreme terror-stricken performance of Marilyn Burns. Her Sally ran circles around Biel's character in sheer essence. You felt Sally's fear because you identified with her. She seemed to be an ordinary person in an incredibly surreal situation. You could identify with her plight. Trust me, if Leatherface was chasing you would you honestly lure him to your hiding place thinking a butcher knife would would protect you against a CHAINSAW? Cha-ching, robbing more points.With all this aside, I can't give the movie a bad review. This revised version of Texas Chainsaw Massacre offered up enough gore and chills to hold my interest. It played great at the drive-in on a Friday night. It will never be as great as the classic, but the story--even told a second time--is so insane you want to hear it again. So watching a newer version was not so bad. It was what's great about drive-in movies. It will never be the original, but it's much better than a lot of the other crap Hollywood's trying to pass off as horror these days, so go ahead. Cheat your principals and see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give the movie a break!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the younger audience, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre delivers everything we want. Most of us haven't even seen the original, so there's no use even comparing the two to most of us. I really liked the movie, not only because it was an edge-of-your-seat thriller, but also because of the way the directors make you feel as if you are actually in that little Texas town. Jessica Biel's character was actually smart, making all the wise moves we hope we would make if we were in that situation! These actors weren't the stock, mass-produced horror film characters. I would definitely recommend seeing this movie if you're a teen (and even if you're not). But head into the theater knowing that you're not going to experience a life-changing lesson...you're just in for a good, long overdue scare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Bay and the old classic horror movie 'The Texas Chainsaw Massarce" being reimagined for a new generation to experience. Many people cringe when they se Michael Bay's name on anything cause his products are empty movies with amazing visuals. Can his horror movies be any different then the other stuff he has put out on the public??....All right, I never saw the orginal so I couldn't compare this to that, but I am glad cause I find that people base their opinions on old films when they get redone do not enjoy the film to the fullest cause their heads are clogged with comparing This movie is definately a good reimagining of the story of a maniac who swings a chainsaw and his nutcase family. Leatherface definately has alot of screen presence, when he is on screen he owns it. You can chills down the spine just by looking at him before he does anything sadistic. His family are just astwisted, especially the sheriff who at times make the movie seem very twisted and dark. Since that is the angle they are going for they succeed. But what they screw up is the cliches and the pacing of the story. Your basic horror elements are here such as noises, people popping out of now where, the idiot teens and the classic creepy gas station that is at the beginning of town. Now, these aren't bad cause they are all elements that make a movie creepy but after a while you just get tired and can know what the movie is going to show you after awhie. The pacing of the story seemed just to get to the violence, wespend the first hald hour getting to know the characters who are very idiotic and uniteresting but are wonderfully played as best as they could. We never get to know that much about anybody besides he is the murder and they are the prey. Jessica Biel, I must admit does a bang up job as the lead female, this girl has a set of lungs on her and gives her character a sense of courage that most horror films do not award girls. But if you do not dig deep into movies like this and only are interested in if you will be scared out of your seat. The answer is yes, this movie is quite good at making you feel freaked out and scared at the sametime. In final words this movie is a good teenage slasher film cause it takes its horror seriously but can not help cliches. Go to the movie at 12 at night and pay the money, you won't regret it cause when in the lone parking lot you will feel jittery.....B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another MTV generation remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, this movie wasn't a total washout, but it turns the Texas Chain Saw Massacre into a typical MTVish slasher flick. Not too bad a job by Jessica Biel, who is dead sexy, in this movie. It moves faster than the original, but is NOWHERE NEAR as good. Modern audiences would like the new version better, but that's just because they've been raised on faster paced MTV generation drivel.*SPOILERS*Why did they show Leatherface's actual face? It ruined the mystique that he had from the original. It added nothing to the story.Why in hell did they give him a back story to explain his origin? What was the point of that? Supposedly he's this misunderstood kid... bleh! How stupid.How easy was it to spot the so-called surprises? Hell, I knew the stupid gun wasn't loaded when the Marcus character pointed it at the sheriff. Also, only a total fool didn't know that Jessica Biel was actually in the cop car instead of the diesel truck. What, did they expect people to actually think that she'd obtained a Class A license and learned how to drive a diesel in a few seconds?How in God's name did Leatherface know that she was in the cop car at the end? Did he just happen to be passing the road at that time? She had been driving for at least a full minute, was Leatherface superfast and able to catch up to a moving car?The worst part of all was that they make the protagonist female character a typical slasher film moron. For God's sake, PICK UP THE CHAINSAW. It's lying there moving around and she just screams as her friend gets killed. Later she has ANOTHER chance to pick up the thing after cutting off Leatherface's arm with a butcher's knife and just runs. Why do they make these characters into complete idiots?*END OF SPOILERS*By the way, Andrew Bryniarski is total wasted in the Leatherface role. If you're going to get a guy with a bodybuilder's physique then USE it.Not the worst remake ever, but definitely worth skipping. If you really want to see it, wait till it's on video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's one shot, not long into this film, that tips you off what you are about to see is either going to deliver on the gory promise and ingenuity of the shot, or the film will never again be as exciting, disgusting, or intriguing. I am happy to report that this is one hell of a capable horror film. It's full of moments, moments you wouldn't predict in the "predictable" slasher genre. I am aware it's a remake, and I have not seen the infamous original. What I can say is that I will compare the 1974 Tobe Hooper production to the 2003 production. Because I was impressed with the 2003 production big time.I've never seen a film so gory, so dramatic, so visceral, probably in all my life. There are so many moments, intense, scary moments, that you'll be haunted by for hours, days, maybe even weeks after seeing this film. The horror genre is often evocative of sexuality to depict it's terror. If you think of some of the scariest films you've ever seen, there's something almost sexual, in a way, to the thrills of the story. This film would be comparable to a one-night stand; a one-night stand which goes all night. There are many climaxes. And they are a confusing mixture of emotions, all seasoning your overall terror. Upon first viewing, I couldn't catch a dramatic or directorial misstep in the storytelling. Repeated viewings may uncover continuity errors, visible crew and equipment, or even plot holes, but upon the first viewing in the theater, I was never withdrawn from the story. I never wondered why a character would act like that instead of doing something more sensible. Which brings me to my biggest compliment for this film. It terrorizes normal kids, sexed up and drugged up a little, but they're nice people, and they come to the house of horrors not out of curiosity or a broken down car, but because they encounter the first real thrill of the film, and they just try to do the right thing. If you don't know what I mean, you will as soon as you see it. This film doesn't just have five cardboard cut-outs being hacked to pieces, but real, likeable, and flawed characters, who happen to be the victims of choice for one of the best "slashers" ever committed to the screen. 3 1/2 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the "classic" version, but a good horror flick just the same</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people will try to over-analyze this film and try to compare it to the original, WHY? This in no way was slated as a "remake" of the original 1974 classic. This a completely different film based off of the original story by Tobe Hooper and Kim Henkel, and in my opinion they succeeded while also staying faithful to Hooper and Henkel's original vision.* WARNING, SPOILERS AHEAD *The film opens up seemingly on the same featureless, dusty Texas road as the first film. A van full of unsuspecting twenty-somethings returning from a "business" trip in Mexico are passing through the heart of the pan handle while heading back to Dallas. They, as all good 1970's samarians do, pick up a teenage girl wandering, zombie-like, on the side of the road. Fearing that she may be in shock, the group take her into their van and head on their way. As events unfold the girl is mumbling incoherently about everyone being dead. Eventually she notices that the group is heading back to where she was trying to escape from, and rather than relive the same horror she survived earlier, she commits suicide in front of the group. The group decides to drive to the nearest phone to report the incident and end up stopping at a local gas station. Thats where they are directed to meet "the sheriff" at a local mill because he can't make it back to the gas station for another 2 hours. Thats when their horror begins as the group is split up and killed off systematically by maniacal Tommy "Leatherface" Hewitt and his macabre family. Of course, as in the original film, only the main girl (Jessica Biel) escapes with her life. Not before chopping off one of Leatherface's arms with a meat cleaver in a desperate attempt to save her life in a meat packing plant.This movie may have quite a few weak plot points and have seemingly little direction and will NEVER be nominated for an Academy Award. This movie still accomplishes its attempt to create a horror movie, plain and simple. What upsets me the most is when someone completely tries to break a HORROR movie down to its basic parts and tries to rationalize the material. A horror movie is neither meant to be rational or logical. Its an escape, and this movie provides said escape and does it perfectly. It fits all the molds neccesary for creating a lasting and scary horror film. Its short, (1hr,30mins.), it has a central character (Biel), it has a Villain (Leatherface), and it has a varied cast of victims and accomplices.Don't listen to all of the naysayers. Go see this movie, its fun and well worth the $7.00.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The new Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a good movie for all of those fans looking for cheap horror scares. Yes this movie made me jump, and was very morbid and gory... which is also nice... but it lacked many things. There was some tie between the new version and the old version but if u didn't see the old one... you are in trouble. The story doesnt explain very well what exactley is going on. Basically this movie is horror film 101. Rain...takes place at night, hot girl with many "wet shirt" shots. So if you are into a good scare come see it. but if u are looking for a great story and seeking thrills and scares that way, like myself, dont bother going and just don't waste your money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im 32 and grew up with Hooper's original, One of my all time fave's.A little weary about seeing the new version, I still went being a huge movie buff. Turned out better then I thought. I knew right off with the camera work it was the work of Mr. Bay. If you seen his movies he made you will know what I'm talking about. This has the same concept as the original but yet it's totally different in a lot of ways. This was very good for todays horror standerds.Lee Ermey was absolute brilliances, hasnt been that good since Full Metal Jacket, if not better. I think he needs atleast a nod towards an Oscar for best supporting actor.The family was very good, mean, and dark in their own way. The little boy was a good touch for the story. He was part of the hewitts but He felt bad for the victoms. The boy didnt have much of a choice on his life so he kept to himself living in the old mill. The letdown with the family was we didnt get to know them all that much. In the living room, I was happy to finally see how the hewitts handled living and interact with eachother. A few seconds later, the scene was over. I wasnt to happy anymore. This was a very cool movie to me and I noticed alot of others enjoyed it too. Was it better than the original? In my opinion, no. There was something missing in the new one and I could not figure it out and still cant.Overall, I was happy with this remake</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake or sequel?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this was a good film, I found several problems with it:* It had so little to do with the original that it would have been more appropriate to simply call it another sequel. Only a few details from the original remain. They even went as far as to change the family name from Sawyer to Hewitt.* Several key points of the original story are lost in the "remake." For instance, the concept of cannibalism that was present in the 1974 version of the film is gone, leaving you to wonder why all these people are getting killed? The plot is almost completely rewritten.* A couple characters in the film seem to have super-human powers when it comes to surviving things. It takes away from the realistic feel the original film had.* They felt the need to try to explain why Leatherface makes masks out of people's skin. In my opinion, not knowing why he did it made it all the more creepy and disgusting.* Speaking of disgusting, the new version on T.C.M. goes a little over the top with a few scenes. One of the things that made the original version so scary was the fact that so much was left to the imagination.On the positive side, R. Lee Ermey's performance can only be described as amazing. Much like his character in Full Metal Jacket, his character in T.C.M. adds an element of humor, but at the same time possesses a dark side. He is truly the shining star of the film.Fans of the 1974 version of the film will probably find the re-tooling almost offensive in its deviation from the script, but I would say that a newcomer would be hard pressed to not enjoy the movie...unless of course they're squeemish. I give it an 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, I thought, was just as disturbing as the original, but with more suspense. It was definitely gorier. The two guys that my father and I sat next to wouldn't shut up for half of the movie, but they didn't spoil it at all. The ending was great, because the whole audience was cheering for Jessica, and there was so much energy in that room that I almost cried. As soon as the end credits came on, the whole theater gave a round of applause to a remake that totally deserves it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the "classic" version, but a good horror flick just the same</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people will try to over-analyze this film and try to compare it to the original, WHY? This in no way was slated as a "remake" of the original 1974 classic. This a completely different film based off of the original story by Tobe Hooper and Kim Henkel, and in my opinion they succeeded while also staying faithful to Hooper and Henkel's original vision.* WARNING, SPOILERS AHEAD *The film opens up seemingly on the same featureless, dusty Texas road as the first film. A van full of unsuspecting twenty-somethings returning from a "business" trip in Mexico are passing through the heart of the pan handle while heading back to Dallas. They, as all good 1970's samarians do, pick up a teenage girl wandering, zombie-like, on the side of the road. Fearing that she may be in shock, the group take her into their van and head on their way. As events unfold the girl is mumbling incoherently about everyone being dead. Eventually she notices that the group is heading back to where she was trying to escape from, and rather than relive the same horror she survived earlier, she commits suicide in front of the group. The group decides to drive to the nearest phone to report the incident and end up stopping at a local gas station. Thats where they are directed to meet "the sheriff" at a local mill because he can't make it back to the gas station for another 2 hours. Thats when their horror begins as the group is split up and killed off systematically by maniacal Tommy "Leatherface" Hewitt and his macabre family. Of course, as in the original film, only the main girl (Jessica Biel) escapes with her life. Not before chopping off one of Leatherface's arms with a meat cleaver in a desperate attempt to save her life in a meat packing plant.This movie may have quite a few weak plot points and have seemingly little direction and will NEVER be nominated for an Academy Award. This movie still accomplishes its attempt to create a horror movie, plain and simple. What upsets me the most is when someone completely tries to break a HORROR movie down to its basic parts and tries to rationalize the material. A horror movie is neither meant to be rational or logical. Its an escape, and this movie provides said escape and does it perfectly. It fits all the molds neccesary for creating a lasting and scary horror film. Its short, (1hr,30mins.), it has a central character (Biel), it has a Villain (Leatherface), and it has a varied cast of victims and accomplices.Don't listen to all of the naysayers. Go see this movie, its fun and well worth the $7.00.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The new Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a good movie for all of those fans looking for cheap horror scares. Yes this movie made me jump, and was very morbid and gory... which is also nice... but it lacked many things. There was some tie between the new version and the old version but if u didn't see the old one... you are in trouble. The story doesnt explain very well what exactley is going on. Basically this movie is horror film 101. Rain...takes place at night, hot girl with many "wet shirt" shots. So if you are into a good scare come see it. but if u are looking for a great story and seeking thrills and scares that way, like myself, dont bother going and just don't waste your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>better then I thought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Im 32 and grew up with Hooper's original, One of my all time fave's.A little weary about seeing the new version, I still went being a huge movie buff. Turned out better then I thought. I knew right off with the camera work it was the work of Mr. Bay. If you seen his movies he made you will know what I'm talking about. This has the same concept as the original but yet it's totally different in a lot of ways. This was very good for todays horror standerds.Lee Ermey was absolute brilliances, hasnt been that good since Full Metal Jacket, if not better. I think he needs atleast a nod towards an Oscar for best supporting actor.The family was very good, mean, and dark in their own way. The little boy was a good touch for the story. He was part of the hewitts but He felt bad for the victoms. The boy didnt have much of a choice on his life so he kept to himself living in the old mill. The letdown with the family was we didnt get to know them all that much. In the living room, I was happy to finally see how the hewitts handled living and interact with eachother. A few seconds later, the scene was over. I wasnt to happy anymore. This was a very cool movie to me and I noticed alot of others enjoyed it too. Was it better than the original? In my opinion, no. There was something missing in the new one and I could not figure it out and still cant.Overall, I was happy with this remake</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into the new version of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre with high hopes and higher reservations. I'm glad to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the film for what it was, and what it didn't try to be. Besides being a good horror film, this movie stood on its own. Sure the characters and situations were largely the same, the makers of the movie were able to put their own stamp on a legend that belongs to more people than just Tobe Hooper ( Silence of the Lambs anyone? ). With amazing cinematography and an outstanding performance by R. Lee Ermey, this current incarnation of the Ed Gein story stands on its own two feet as a modern horror classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice retelling of the tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As we start, let's dispense with the main question:Is it REALLY based on a true story? Well, yes it is. My having lived in TX for 20 years isn't my knowledge base there, my knowledge of criminal history is. FACT SPOILER: The true story part is that Leatherface is based on Ed Gein, a Wisconsin murderer who also inspired the "Buffalo Bill" character from Silence of the Lambs. In it's own right, the film Ed Gein is certainly worth watching. So, sadly enough, Texas Chainsaw didn't 'happen' in Texas at all. But, frighteningly enough, there is a reality base. END SPOILER.Is the 2003 retelling of the tale worth the time and money to see? Absolutely YES. For those familiar with the original (as I am), it is especially fun to watch the new version to see how they line up and diverge from one another. To address the question of the copious blood and gore in many wannabe films nowadays, rest assured, TX Chainsaw tells the tale without gratuitous blood. They show some, but only enough to move the story along. I was pleased that the production team veered away from a sea of red. Quite frankly, the Tobe Hooper 1973 original is certainly more horrifying, mentally straining, and emotionally twisting than this one. The 2003 version doesn't make you want to walk (or run) away from it as the ending sections of the original did. It carries you on an adrenaline high and gives a more reassuring ending. The effects and lighting arts have improved since 1973 and this film shows that. The sets are fairly powerful as well. The basement escape scene parallels the meat company cattle chutes in an eerie visual dimension. Unfortunately, that will be lost on most of the audience.I sat in the theater and watched people jump throughout. I left with my date's faceprint pressed into my arm. I heard the crowd debating whether it could really be true as they spread out amongst the parking lot. All in all, a good film-going experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1/2 decent ideas, 1/2 cheap startle effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to say that it was a brave endeavor to take on remaking such a renowned cult film, but realistically what did these film makers have to lose? I'm sure that offending fans of the original was hardly a large concern, and although I can say I was not thoroughly disgusted (as a big fan of the original), I can say that this movie should be considered on its own ground and not compared directly (that seems fair, right)?As a horror movie of its own, it does pretty well at creating a creepy environment, with good sets and truly repulsive antagonists. And the one element that truly made the original scary, that feeling of utter hopelessness, is definitely attempted though not accomplished perfectly. The story is changed around in a manner similar to how a rumor may get twisted from the original event after multiple repetitions from person to person, and this is a good idea for a remake. However, like many horror movies of today, I found absolutely no reason to sympathize with the victims (though when do we ever, I suppose). I also found the film relied more on cheap guy-jumping-from-behind-the-car/wall/stair/shadows/etc. than real scary images or sounds. And the new Leatherface character seemed to have a very Jason Voorhees persona to him. I also think much of the suspense is lost with the film attempting to explain everything pertaining to why certain things are happening. That is what gave the original its edge. But here we get some typical background as to why the killer is such a twisted and bitter entity. That weakened the film immensely. Another major missing element is the pure insanity of the original. You may argue with me, but really, which film was truly more bizarre?What it did do well: I liked the few nods to the original, like John Larroquette reading the prologue (a longer, far more unnecessarily comprehensive version as well as a *really* unnecessary epilogue), and the van that the kids drive is as close to the same van from the '74 film as one could get. I also think Leatherface's mask was semi-decent. But the scriptwriters needed to look at what made the original truly frightening; I think they could have extracted some better ideas and still come up with an original remake.-&gt;See it if: you like startle movies (a great first date movie), you haven't seen the original (you are perhaps too young to appreciate low-budget 70's flicks yet) or your curiosity is just eating you up inside. -&gt;Do not see it if: you know what makes a movie truly horrifying, and you accept nothing less. It will probably irritate you by the end.</fullReview>

Usually I'm not that easily creeped out by scary movies, but this movie made me scream, Leatherface was just as terrifying like the original, maybe even more. The story was so interesting. I could not stop watching, and half way through the movie, I had to pee really bad, but I couldn't leave. That's how good I thought it was. I always wondered about Leatherface and his family, I really wanted to know his life story, and this sorta tells it. I really hope that this will be the final TCM movie, because if they make another sequil i'll be p***ed, I liked the one with Renee Zellweger though. I think this is one of my favorite movies now, I can't wait to see it again!!! 10/10 stars. This Movie Was Worth It.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good first half, but amounts to nothing in the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, this review is not totally a fair one. Having not seen the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I have nothing to base this re-make on, and therefore have nothing but what I've heard to go on. However, I feel that those who have chastised me in the past about my lack of classic horror movie viewing will now uplift me. This movie is absolute and utter crap. Plain and simple. For all of its ninety-five plus minutes-or, at least it's second half-there is not one, single redeeming factor to it's subject matter. The acting is solid and true at times, but grows painful and melodramatic. The gore is awesomely glorified, but becomes just outright sick and twisted. What could have been a straight-up cool-looking and really, really good movie for the ages-as judging from, possibly, the best trailer of all time-sadly and wrongly mutates into something that couldn't even fight its way against the bile that collects at the back of a human's throat. For its first hour or so, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre looks to be a gruesome and rather horrifying tale. We follow five teens, Erin (Jessica Biel), Kemper (Eric Balfour), Morgan (Jonathon Tucker), Andy (Mike Vogel) and Pepper (Erica Leerhsen) on their way to Dallas, Texas to see a Lynard Skynard concert. On the road, they encounter a hitchhiker and pick her up, only to have her shoot herself after talking of death coming their way. The teens cruise on down the road to a small town and find a gigantic, mansion of a country house. Here they look to find a phone in order to radio in the mysterious hitchhiker's suicide. What they find is an insane, inbred family of freaks, lead by a demented, chainsaw-wielding maniac known as Leatherface, that looks for nothing more than to use the kids' skin as masks. The movie is beautifully directed in its first chapters, using some of the most badass looking film stock I've seen used in film history. Ever. It's visually exciting and mind-blowingly colorful, using dollies and steadycams to its advantage, and coming out with a great end result. The actors convince the audience and give them something to feel for as they try to deal with the dead body that now lies in their van, also giving the audience something to cry at for as the first two bodies pile up. It's just a shame that the pained and physically deformed Leatherface doesn't exist in real life. His input would have been useful to the producers and crew once they started photography for the remaining scenes. As we delve deeper into the story, it is made abundantly clear that we have been tricked by what we have just seen. The acting becomes flat and over-the-top, the cinematography becomes dizzying, and what could have been some fascinatingly bloody effects becomes something that's just plain bloody. It amounts to nothing more than watching Jessica Biel, known to most of the world as `that chick from 7th Heaven', running away from or towards something, her jutting bosoms soaked in sweat, rain and blood. Come the final showdown, you're rooting for Leatherface to kill off each and every person involved in making this movie. Director Marcus Nispel, who has only worked previously on music videos for the likes of Janet Jackson and Faith No More, and first-time screenwriter Scott Kosar cannot solely be blamed for the travesty that has befallen on the world of film. Originally slated to direct, Michael Bay acts as producer on the film, and doesn't shred an inch of talent in the department. He does, however, receive kudos for the photography, because the whole film in itself plays so like a Bay movie, it might as well have been. There are a few things to like about this trashy re-make. Don't get me wrong. Jonathon Tucker and Mike Vogel are the only to pass the acting test with flying colors. Mr. Tucker, known best to the indie and made-for-TV world of movies, knows exactly how to direct and position a character, as does so with Morgan. Mr. Vogel offers a spine-tingling performance as Andy, a character who hangs from a meat hook for the majority of the film. His pain is truly the audience's pain as well. Eric Balfour and Erica Leerhsen do their characters justice, but aren't given enough time or room to elaborate on or do anything with them. The hugest collapse in the acting is Ms. Biel. The actress, now nothing more than a starlet for the WB, can do nothing but what her character is written to do: scream and run around like the sex symbol she is. R. Lee Ermey returns to the film world and suffers the same fate as Biel. All he can do here is phone in the same performance that has haunted his career in acting since Full Metal Jacket. Kudos does go, however, to music composer, Steve Jablonsky, and the sound design team. Jablonsky is the only party involved in the movie-making process to be fully pardoned, thanks to his absolutely bone-chilling score, and the sound team offers up some truly excruciating jumps and tingles. All in all, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a film that looks good, but really isn't. It's a shame to say, too, due to the underrated greatness of that theatrical trailer. It's one that could have been great, but in the end just amounts to nothing at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen all of the texas chainsaw massacre films and I have to say that I loved the 2003 version the best. the acting was terrific and the scenes were so tramatic I literaly caught myself crying in certain parts of the movie. out of 10 stars I would give it 10 stars. its more modern wich makes it more fun to watch the suspense was high for me and alot of people I know who have seen the 2003 version. I loved the seen when jessica biel was thrown in the basement and saw her friend hanging from a meat hook and she trys to pull him off while his toes are twitching on the piano keys jessica biel has to stab him to put him out of his misery that seen to me was dramatic and all I kept thinking about was this is a true story how horrible would that be. that scene made me cry.I jumped a total of 5 times.I put my fingers in my ears for at least half of the movie cause the noise was so horrific.I closed my eyes a couple of times in the movie.I went to see this movie october 18,2003 bymyself and it was the best ridiculous amount of money I have ever spent on a movie ticket. I would definetly recommend this movie because, the gore is alot.I got nauscious a couple of times. im buying it on dvd the first day its released (first in line)other than the gore its got suspense a few funny scenes that make you laugh and scenes for some people that could make you cry</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was Super-uper Scary! My heart kept pounding I even felt short of breath at times. Wonderful movie for Horror fanatics out there. The story line was great I'm thinking they are going to come out with the remake of part 2. I loved the Ending it was very rewarding. I Highly recommend this movie but it is definetly not for the faint of heart. The guy next to me at the movie kept jumping and the people at the cinema kept screaming so that adds to the effect. Go see it today!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All i have to say about this movie is, It does the original justice. Most remakes SUCK!! But this one was awesome. Usually I'm not that easily creeped out by scary movies, but this movie made me scream, Leatherface was just as terrifying like the original, maybe even more. The story was so interesting. I could not stop watching, and half way through the movie, I had to pee really bad, but I couldn't leave. That's how good I thought it was. I always wondered about Leatherface and his family, I really wanted to know his life story, and this sorta tells it. I really hope that this will be the final TCM movie, because if they make another sequil i'll be p***ed, I liked the one with Renee Zellweger though. I think this is one of my favorite movies now, I can't wait to see it again!!! 10/10 stars. This Movie Was Worth It.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good first half, but amounts to nothing in the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, this review is not totally a fair one. Having not seen the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I have nothing to base this re-make on, and therefore have nothing but what I've heard to go on. However, I feel that those who have chastised me in the past about my lack of classic horror movie viewing will now uplift me. This movie is absolute and utter crap. Plain and simple. For all of its ninety-five plus minutes-or, at least it's second half-there is not one, single redeeming factor to it's subject matter. The acting is solid and true at times, but grows painful and melodramatic. The gore is awesomely glorified, but becomes just outright sick and twisted. What could have been a straight-up cool-looking and really, really good movie for the ages-as judging from, possibly, the best trailer of all time-sadly and wrongly mutates into something that couldn't even fight its way against the bile that collects at the back of a human's throat. For its first hour or so, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre looks to be a gruesome and rather horrifying tale. We follow five teens, Erin (Jessica Biel), Kemper (Eric Balfour), Morgan (Jonathon Tucker), Andy (Mike Vogel) and Pepper (Erica Leerhsen) on their way to Dallas, Texas to see a Lynard Skynard concert. On the road, they encounter a hitchhiker and pick her up, only to have her shoot herself after talking of death coming their way. The teens cruise on down the road to a small town and find a gigantic, mansion of a country house. Here they look to find a phone in order to radio in the mysterious hitchhiker's suicide. What they find is an insane, inbred family of freaks, lead by a demented, chainsaw-wielding maniac known as Leatherface, that looks for nothing more than to use the kids' skin as masks. The movie is beautifully directed in its first chapters, using some of the most badass looking film stock I've seen used in film history. Ever. It's visually exciting and mind-blowingly colorful, using dollies and steadycams to its advantage, and coming out with a great end result. The actors convince the audience and give them something to feel for as they try to deal with the dead body that now lies in their van, also giving the audience something to cry at for as the first two bodies pile up. It's just a shame that the pained and physically deformed Leatherface doesn't exist in real life. His input would have been useful to the producers and crew once they started photography for the remaining scenes. As we delve deeper into the story, it is made abundantly clear that we have been tricked by what we have just seen. The acting becomes flat and over-the-top, the cinematography becomes dizzying, and what could have been some fascinatingly bloody effects becomes something that's just plain bloody. It amounts to nothing more than watching Jessica Biel, known to most of the world as `that chick from 7th Heaven', running away from or towards something, her jutting bosoms soaked in sweat, rain and blood. Come the final showdown, you're rooting for Leatherface to kill off each and every person involved in making this movie. Director Marcus Nispel, who has only worked previously on music videos for the likes of Janet Jackson and Faith No More, and first-time screenwriter Scott Kosar cannot solely be blamed for the travesty that has befallen on the world of film. Originally slated to direct, Michael Bay acts as producer on the film, and doesn't shred an inch of talent in the department. He does, however, receive kudos for the photography, because the whole film in itself plays so like a Bay movie, it might as well have been. There are a few things to like about this trashy re-make. Don't get me wrong. Jonathon Tucker and Mike Vogel are the only to pass the acting test with flying colors. Mr. Tucker, known best to the indie and made-for-TV world of movies, knows exactly how to direct and position a character, as does so with Morgan. Mr. Vogel offers a spine-tingling performance as Andy, a character who hangs from a meat hook for the majority of the film. His pain is truly the audience's pain as well. Eric Balfour and Erica Leerhsen do their characters justice, but aren't given enough time or room to elaborate on or do anything with them. The hugest collapse in the acting is Ms. Biel. The actress, now nothing more than a starlet for the WB, can do nothing but what her character is written to do: scream and run around like the sex symbol she is. R. Lee Ermey returns to the film world and suffers the same fate as Biel. All he can do here is phone in the same performance that has haunted his career in acting since Full Metal Jacket. Kudos does go, however, to music composer, Steve Jablonsky, and the sound design team. Jablonsky is the only party involved in the movie-making process to be fully pardoned, thanks to his absolutely bone-chilling score, and the sound team offers up some truly excruciating jumps and tingles. All in all, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a film that looks good, but really isn't. It's a shame to say, too, due to the underrated greatness of that theatrical trailer. It's one that could have been great, but in the end just amounts to nothing at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great movie "some words may spoil the movie" 2003</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen all of the texas chainsaw massacre films and I have to say that I loved the 2003 version the best. the acting was terrific and the scenes were so tramatic I literaly caught myself crying in certain parts of the movie. out of 10 stars I would give it 10 stars. its more modern wich makes it more fun to watch the suspense was high for me and alot of people I know who have seen the 2003 version. I loved the seen when jessica biel was thrown in the basement and saw her friend hanging from a meat hook and she trys to pull him off while his toes are twitching on the piano keys jessica biel has to stab him to put him out of his misery that seen to me was dramatic and all I kept thinking about was this is a true story how horrible would that be. that scene made me cry.I jumped a total of 5 times.I put my fingers in my ears for at least half of the movie cause the noise was so horrific.I closed my eyes a couple of times in the movie.I went to see this movie october 18,2003 bymyself and it was the best ridiculous amount of money I have ever spent on a movie ticket. I would definetly recommend this movie because, the gore is alot.I got nauscious a couple of times. im buying it on dvd the first day its released (first in line)other than the gore its got suspense a few funny scenes that make you laugh and scenes for some people that could make you cry</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good remake of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It is a good-fashion scary movie. Although if you have a very sensitive stomach I recommand you not to see it. With all the grisly bloody violence by slicing people in half with the chainsaw, blowing your brains out in front of camera, having a hook puntured into your back and just hanging there for hours either waiting for you to die slowing losing blood or waiting for leatherface to cut off your face and use it as a mask. I really thought it was an average horror movie. Leatherface actually looked even scarier with ripped up butcher clothes instead of a suit and tie in the original. Anyway I would recommand it to otherpeople if they like grisly horror flicks</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A run of the mill gory teen slasher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this project first began, I read an article that Michael Bay intended to make this remake more in the "Blair Witch" style than in the ultra-violent style of the original film. Of course, this brings to mind the idea that he may never have seen the original, and most certainly didn't pay any attention to it if he did. So the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake ends up a shadow of its original, substituting beautiful people and gore for the raw emotional impact of its predecessor. What works for the film is above par acting and nice cinematography and lighting. R Lee Ermey in particular does a fantastic job with his role as a two dimensional southern stereotype. Jessica Biel as well does better than the script deserves, much to my surprise. The film does stand up against other recent teen slashers quite well though, putting the "Urban Legend" series and "Valentine" to shame, but that's not saying too much. Ultimately though, like 99% of remakes, it leaves you with the question "Why didn't I just watch the original instead?" "I could have been brought on a journey into a different dark world, but instead I'm watching tripe with 10 times the gore, and 1/10 the impact."</fullReview>

The movie feels more like a Halloween movie than The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Plus with the horrible editing (which must have been done by an autistic kid from the make a wish foundation), you will be staring at the screen in utter frustration when scenes skip with no logical progression.The movie just gave off too much of a modern day vibe for it to feel completely realistic. The kids felt like they just got back from this year's TRL Spring Break, and the family was way too "southern redneck" stereotypical to feel like something more than a family out of a comedy.I gave it a 4 of 10 here, and I felt that was even generous.

		<shortDescription>Best remake ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally, a movie that when someone asks "Was it all it was hyped up to be?" you can answer in the affirmative. In short-this movie OWNS. Are the characters well drawn? Not at all. Are they cliche? Do they make you yawn? Boy howdy, do they ever. Are the scares good? YOU BETTER BELIEVE THEY ARE! This movie made the audience scream with every jump scare, and we know how much those have lost their ability to frighten. Don't ask me how, but this movie overcame its storytelling faults and may become a cult classic, a few notches below the original (or above, depending on your loyalty to it).It will linger your dreams for nights to come. Especially the final shot, thats really what clinched it for me. "This is the only image of the man known as Leatherface. The case is still open." Wow! You should've been in the auditorium. A funeral silence came over us as we left, not broken until we left the screening room.Can't wait to see it again, baby!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real rarity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I am huge fan of the original so hearing that there was goin to be remake, could only mean bad news. And the more ifon I gathered about the movie really granered no further hope. First, it was said that it would focus more on thrills than gore. Then I saw a screenshot with Jessica Biel, even though she looked extra hot, it really made me think that it was going to be crap. However, a huge ray of sunshine came when Roger Ebert gave th e film zero stars and was just appalled by all the grotesque actions taking place. After reading the review, I knew that this was not going to be the typical 90s teen horror movie and was going to be the good old fashioned horror which highly respected critics just dont get. Thew first thing I have to say is that this is by far the best remake to ever to come out. It is changed enough for it to be its own movie but it still captures some of the original essence of the 1974 film. Ironically, unlike the 1974 film, these4 teens are all complete idiots. Not that they are incerdibly that smart either but they dont do things just to do things, they actually have a reason for their actions (exception being jessica Biels bf. he was all Idiot, I mean, it wouldnt be a horror movie if their wasn't). Speaking of which, Jessica Biel really suprised me. She actually has acting talent (and a nice jiggle factor but thats an entirely different issue). She doesnt act overtly dumb or overly smart, she acts scared and confused but still determined to do somthing. Does she know what she wants to do? No. Does she know what will be acoomplished? No. She is just doing her best to remain as calm as she possibly can given the circumstances but does breakdown at certain points because she realises the utter hoplessness of a particular situation. And when she does fight back, it is purely out of desperation becuase there is no other way to escape other than to attack and hope for the best.POSSIBLE SPOILERSNow, there are a few particular scenes that stand out and differentiate it from the original. First one being the SHeriff forcing one of the teens to renact the hitchhikers suicide. This scene's disturbing nature, in a way, surpasses the original. The sheriff forces the teen to sit where the hitchhiker was sitting, which of course, is covered in blood, and brain matter. The Sheriff goes as far to have the teen stick a gun in his mouth just like the hitchhiker. the other scene that stuck out is where jessica biel and one of the other male teens (who is hanging on a meat hook) are in the basement of the of house and the male teen is begging her to kill him becuase he cant stand the pain of being ona meat hook and any attempt to get him off the hook would possibly kill him. In most horror movies, it usually the killer forcing someone to kill her friend or the killer kills the friend in front of the girl. In this one, there is no one really forcing her to kill him or forcing her to watch him be killed. It is being done out of their own accordance.Of course, it cannot surpass the original as an overall movie becuase the reamke does not have the originals originality. Basically, in 1974, nothing like this has been done, storywise or gorewise. Nowadays, we have action movies that match the horro gore and the chaisaw killer has been imitated time and time again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A valiant effort hampered by amateurish mistakes and lack of originality...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I just got back from a screening of TCM and in some ways I really don't know what to say, but heres my take on it. On one side I will commend the makers of the film for not making a tongue in cheek laugh fest like I had once feared they would, and straying from becoming the foul, odious mess that was cemented in Hollywood by the makers of Scream. They truly TRIED to make this a horror film no doubt and for that they do deserve credit. Leatherface was far better than I expected he would be (though I still have qualms with him and how he was utilized), and was effective in how he was used in certain scenes. Eric Balfour was excellent (though sorely underutilized) and R. Lee Ermey added some credibility to an otherwise lacking cast.However the film they made was so riddled by cliché Hollywood moments I was ready to scream at the screen halfway through the film. Nothing was truly left to the imagination, it was way overdone and in your face, and totally took the aura of disbelief I was trying to bask in away early. I don't need to hear some loud screech every time something quickly darts by the screen to understand there is danger nearby, doing things like that only denotes a lack of skill in making something frightening to begin with. Dolby scares were served amply in the movie and far too often. The soundtrack was particularly annoying, it never would let up long enough to allow you to immerse yourself in the film, it always made sure to remind you were still just watching one.But what was truly unnerving to begin with was how they squandered the potential for what could have been truly excellent film by playing to the same tired moments that horror has had for ages. Not a single scene came that somehow surprised me, almost every single scare was something you saw coming a mile ahead of execution so it was really hard to jump, in fact of the 10 people that were in the theatre at 1:00 none of them did either (though granted most were male). I was truly expecting SOMETHING scary given these reviews I had read, but I guess I'm far too desensitized to complain, but still. I expected something to maybe shock me. I liked certain key areas they were moving the kids through but the house itself looked very prop ridden and set up, the chase scene beneath with Morgan and Erin in particular looked very much like something a local haunted house would have rigged. The only thing missing was strobe lights and given how illuminated and `in the open' they made the house look I'm thankful for that.Some things really had me scratching my head and questioning logic though such as the hitchhiker and her suicide. As they find her she's seems very moribund and sapped given the situation so you know she's obviously been through a lot. When she freaks out she pulls a handgun and blows her brains out the question remains just where the hell did the gun come from? When she was walking outside the van you could fully see there was nothing there as the wind pressed her dress against her pelvic region, yet she reaches down and wields a weapon out of thin air? Maybe I'm missing something here, but where the hell did that gun come from? Her Vagina? If she had the gun why didn't she USE its on them? Well, perhaps she grabbed it and escaped so I can buy that. But why was the family oblivious to her having escaped, and why weren't they up in arms trying to find her knowing that if she found the proper authorities that they would have been exposed? You can always argue that the sheriff was out looking for her, but the family never makes as much as a peep regarding her being found after being wrapped up. What was up with Leatherface tripping over the fence while chasing Erin and getting sliced up by his own saw, yet once he made his way into the slaughterhouse he was fine and seemed to have no ill effects at all from the wounds, not even a slight limp? But she hacks on him for a few moments and he's on the ground whining like a child? They really seemed to have a hard on for him being right behind her like Jason Voorhees and his victims, it effectively took away the scary human side the original Leatherface embodied. I mean he wasn't supposed to be some superhuman, yet he could tiptoe his big lummox ass right up behind her with out her even hearing a crackle of the rubbish beneath his foot? Come on, these places were riddled with junk, it would be hell to move undetected. Why did Andy not go into shock after half his leg was chopped off and he was hung on a hook (which by the way was way lame compared to the ferocity of the original hook scene), yet he goes dead limp upon having a knife shoved into his abdomen buy Erin? Getting stabbed in the gut is no small thing and it hurts like hell, you don't just `fall limp'. If anything he would have been writhing in agony even more. The flow of events also felt very Hollywood, it was almost as if you could imagine the sheriff in a huddle with the family saying `positions everyone!' because everything came across as so immaculate in how it moved from scare to scare, to the point of being artificial. Given her escape you began to ask yourself just how many of the Hewitt's there were, and if they were gonna cover half of Texas. again to play up the `based on a true story' bit it felt very synthetic.Overall I give them credit for trying though. I rate the film 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit this remake of the Classic was not too shabby. This film did not quite capture the horrific brutality Tobe Hooper did. But it did add a bit of ferocity... which is ALWAYS sweet for a horror movie. I will add more when others have a chance to check it out. I gave it a 9 out of 10. That's mainly because it was one of the more effective horror films in a while. (Oh, and by the way, speaking of horror remakes, they did show a trailer for "Dawn of the Dead." Cool.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, i would like to say that it was great to finally see a horror movie that lived up to its genre. This past year, there hasn't been any movie that I found to be even a little scary. They've all fallen prey to bad acting, cheesy dialouge and terrible plots. Now FINALLY, a movie that actually made me want to cover my eyes out of fear. I saw the original a few years ago and it scared me pretty good. So naturally I was interested in seeing the remake. The nice thing about the new one is that even though i knew the basic storyline, it still had that same unpredictable quality that made the first one scary.The only real issue i had with this movie is that in certain scenes it seemed like the chainsaw had a mute button, where as Leatherface could sneak right up on you and you wouldn't know he was there till he started cutting. Other than that, it was a pretty freaky flick!</fullReview>

Not to mention several key scenes from the original are missing.I never expected a by-the-book remake, but this is just stupid.The creepiness of the original is replaced by cliche jump shocks. Characters popping out of corners, playing jokes, etc.There is also a musical score that intrudes on every scene, where little or no music would have done so much more for the film.The entire last act of the film is one long chase scene. It is ridiculously stretched out to where you could go to the bathroom for 10 minutes and come back only to find the character STILL RUNNING and screaming...yawn...The movie should have been titled Tank Top. It's all this is about. Seriously. There are no twists, no surprises, nothing except chase scene after chase scene.See the original.</fullReview>

It is ridiculously stretched out to where you could go to the bathroom for 10 minutes and come back only to find the character STILL RUNNING and screaming...yawn...The movie should have been titled Tank Top. It's all this is about. Seriously. There are no twists, no surprises, nothing except chase scene after chase scene.See the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Alert! This terrifying movie, based on true events that happened in Travis County, Texas, in 1973, will make you jump out of your chair; I know, because I did. The movie begins with the state police and FBI searching the Thomas Hewitt farmhouse, where they have discovered a large collection of body parts. The movie flashes back several days to a VW bus with 5 young people returning from Mexico. They almost hit a girl in a state of shock, walking in the middle of the road. They try to help her and put her in the bus. She thinks they are taking her back, and pulls out a hidden gun and commits suicide. The young people on the bus contact the police, and unfortunately, they end up at Hewitt's farmhouse, where the grisly killings begin. They encounter the leatherface killer, who is wearing a mask made from the flesh of his victims, and his waving chainsaw. Don't ever get in his path! If you like scary movies, you will like this all-time classic. (New Line Cinema, Runtime 1:38, Rated R) 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick Professional Remake Fails to Live Up to the Shocking Reality of the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** 1/2 out of ****When I first heard of this re-telling of the Hooper classic, I was seriously concerned about the priority of Hollywood filmmakers. Armed with tremendous budgets, computer special effects and professional writers, it first appeared that today's dream makers have the ability to realize projects once limited to only the imagination. However, the trend of Hollywood these days caters to only the marketing department as studio after studio chose to unleash spirited remakes of proven films to maximize the payback. TCM seemed like a similiarly doomed franchise. But with a few spoilers tossed my way and several intriguing film clips leaked online, my attitude definately changed as i prepared myself for the remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I was even excited to see a good saw flick on the screen.However i would soon realize that any reverence I had for the remake concept quickly crumpled with the Marcus Nispel music video re-telling of the Tobe Hooper classic. I didn't hate it, but clearly this wasn't the lightning in a bottle, snuff film quality slasher that currently gathers dust on my video store shelves.The main problem with the Nispel remake concerns the use of the "this is a true story" angle that opens and drives the film but also deludes the audience into believing that the events of this piece are factual. It seems illogical to me for a film that boasts to be a "true account", no matter how ludicrous the reality of that statement is, to contain as many Michael Bay esque money shots and bold moving Armaggeddon esque scoring as this film did. Any fears of Bay's involvement are realized after the hitchiker money shot which is unique in an advant garde kind. The photography here is so slick, the set pieces so stylized, and the music so epic, any sense of the audience being in the film is lost. Overeditting confuses the action especially near the end; it is unclear how the heroine escapes a number of times or how leather sustains his injuries because the editting is so out of control. This isn't recovered footage; this is celluloid processed and pampered and decorated with the self serving brush strokes of Bad Boys or Aramaggeddon. Nispel definately chooses to focus on the artistry of decay but he could have been much more effective with less light and less styleThe characters in Nispel's piece are more developed than Hooper's film but unlike that film I didnt' get a sense these people lived outside the confines of this screenplay. They seemed programmed and instintive but clearly this isn't a snapshot of real people. I missed Franklin, kirk, pam, and jerry. They seemed like people you could meet at a rock concert or a library cafe. Kemper, Andy, Pepper, and Morgan are Hollywood conventions; cookie cut characters ready to be sawed and served on the same silver platter occupied by fat Harry Knowles ridiculous cameo.I enjoyed the Family in this film. Their intentions seemed mysterious which i like; I didn't understand exactly what they wanted or how they could get away with it for so long. Are they cannibals or just wackos? it is unclear. What are their relationships to one another? once again Nispel doesn't enlighten us, but there is a novelty in their madness especially in Ermey's gleefully psychotic Sheriff and the Old Monty slimeball. Too bad they disappear for the last third of the film.Leatherface is different here. there is an explanation to his behavior but he afterall is only a killing machine. There is little to no embellishment of his character at all, save for an intriguing scene where the family is all collected in the house but Nispel quickly cuts away and focuses on more quality camera shots. I actually grew sick of him; he is present in nearly every scene for the last 40 minutes and its novelty wears off. Give me Ermey for two hours and i'll be happy. He steals every moment and his sick intentions are more fearfull than the emotionless, characterless Jason eque Leatherface that Nispel has created. Leather is a bore; his mask is cool in quick shots but he is a force here, no human qualities, no personality, nothing but a demented killer.Overall, the remake is scary in the same manner of Silence of the Lambs, via gross outs inflicted dementia of its heavies. There were no truly original scares only gore and those silly people jumping out of dark places . I am happy this is a return to serious horror, hope it lasts, but all in all this remake seems gratuitous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Remake, Better Than Most Current Efforts in the Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the fortune to catch the remake of TCM in Austin during its premiere screening. Remakes are a difficult genre to assess. A good argument can be made for assessing the film on its own merits, but there are things about remakes that beg you to compare them to their original source material.This film almost presumes that the audience is deeply familiar with Hooper's 1974 classic and rather than immediately disappoint them with a contemporary rehashing of the original Hooper and Henkel script, the film is cleverly reimagined using a narrative device familiar to those who have seen "Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2" (oddly enough, a sequel to a contemporary horror film that seems deeply inspired by the original TCM). In "BOS: BWII," the story is alleged to be a reconstruction of events from a true crime by devotees of the original "Blair Witch Project," albeit it with a supernatural twist that the jury refused to consider during the subsequent trials of those involved in the crime.In the 2003 version of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," the new film's prologue and epilogue continue the original TCM's promotional propaganda that the film is based on actual events (a claim which all too many people confuse with the true story of Wisconsin's Ed Gein, whose real story only provided very rough inspiration for Hooper) but then suggests that because much of the official record has been sealed until now that this is the first legitimate retelling of the events that occurred (the first film presumably having been based on a rough and unofficial recounting of the same events, thus the differences in the stories).The film, in keeping with the rather grim tone of the original, also dispenses with much of the baggage that had accompanied the various TCM sequels (most notably, the family's name is Hewitt rather than the too cute to be clever "Sawyer"). But there are others things missing. The protagonists here look like refugees from the WB (no surprise given that 3 of them have played prominent roles in recent WB series) and the Hewitt clan often comes off as little more than bad Southern stereotypes (although R. Lee Ermey stands out from the rest of the cast in this regard in a nicely twisted role).The exact motivation of Leatherface and company here is also unclear, versus the more perverse allusions to their cannibalism in the original version (they might be cannibals, or just plain sadists). The sense of dread created when the Texas clan was prepared to allow Grandpa to brain Sally Hardesty is missing here, with Leatherface, at times, coming off as little more than a typical movie slasher, albeit one with a chainsaw rather than a machete or a butcher knife.Still, the cinematography is outstanding, capturing the beauty and desolation that is the Texas countryside. There is also great work with lighting (Hoyt's scene with Morgan in the van looks awesome as does the dankness of the Hewitt basement). The initial introduction to the protagonists and the disruption of their "idyllic" day is also very well done. Given the lacksadaisical efforts put out by other studios in this genre, the producers and director here really seem to have made a game effort and should be applauded for doing so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>90s Update - SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In one word: BRUTAL. I saw the original quite some time ago and remember little of it. This one was pretty intense compared to the horror films of late (namely Freddy vs. Jason). I was worried that the director had done music videos and commercials and the film would be all style and no substance. But once the first character goes down, I realised this wasn't going to be a typical lightweight outing. More so than the gore (which was largely implied and made to seem worse than it was) the cruelty of the family really wore down your defenses. The sheriff particularly was a cruel individual, thinking of when he whacked the kid with the bottle. By being worn down by that kind of trauma the shocks when Leatherface popped up made me jump even more (and I jumped A LOT!) There were the cliches and implausibilities rampant in modern horror films, but overall it was truly a great update (better than the weak Psycho remake), some laughs but not at the expense of the horror, and a truly engrossing experience. Brutal. Intense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad... Not Bad At All!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was fortunate enough to score a few tickets to the premiere of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" remake, and I have to say it exceeded my expectations. The original TCM is one of the movies that introduced me to the horror genre, and because of that I was very concerned that they would try to make this movie more accessible to the "MTV generation" by relying more on flashy visuals and unneccesary humor rather than gritty, all-out gore.Fortunately, those concerns were quickly pushed aside.While the movie can never be praised for originality, credit must be given to the filmmakers for adding new ideas and changing parts of the movie so that even long-time fans won't be sure of what to expect.A lot of care was put into Leatherface in this incarnation - considering that he's what makes the whole thing scary to begin with. In my own honest opinion, he's way more frightening in this version than the original. Not that the original wasn't - but here it's just that he's more fast, powerful, and deadly. Even better, he doesn't pop out at times you're expecting him to, but rather... when you least expect it. There are some homages to the first TCM present, so at least the new blood pays respect to the old.So, if you like horror, go on and see this movie. If not for ol' Leatherface, then at least see it to let the studios know "Hey, we need more movies with Jessica Biel getting drenched, whilst wearing a white top."</fullReview>

This film stands on its own, and it only a bare bones remake, much like Ocean's 11 did not resemble the original all that much. And best of all, it made me jump several times--always the mark of a great horror film.And Jessica Biel looking smoking hot didn't hurt matters either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Chainsaw Fans Nocturnal Emission.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well after viewing the screening here in Atlanta, Georgia, I must say I was impressed with the re-make, but still slightly disappointed. With Michael Bay's Platinum Dunes production company involvement in the film, one can tell the special effects were top-notch. The Hewitt farm house was decorated to the max and had the same eerie feeling as the original version. Daniel Pearl's cinema style made the audience feel as if `Leatherface' himself was in their face.As a fan of the original, the beginning started out with sunny skies, marijuana, `Sweet Home Alabama', &amp; four nonchalant teenagers. The driver, Kemper (Eric Balfour) decides to pick up a teenage hitchhiker (Lauren German), who they almost run over, which sets them on their fateful journey. Running into the deranged sheriff (R. Lee Ermey) offers disturbing comic relief (If a fan of Full Metal Jacket one will snicker at his demeaning slanders). As the story goes, one knows there is death and lunacy among poor Erin (Jessica Biel) as she tries to seek refuge.This new version lacks a few scenes from the original, but offers more in your face modern violence. The only disappointment was that my personal favorite scenes from the original version, i.e. the family dinner scene, grandpa &amp; various others seemed to be missing. Not too give anything away, the remake follows the traditional story in some sense, but strays off into a more contemporary horror film. I will say though, in my opinion, this new remake blows all other attempts out of the water. Marcus Nispel brings a truly eerie thriller back to life while not ruining the `Texas Chainsaw Massacre's' reputation as being a horror classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>far better than it had any right to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll try to be brief &amp; exact in the reasons that made watching the new TCM the greatest horror-movie going theatrical experience that I had in the last couple of years:1.You'll be scared watching this in the cinema, and the bigger the crowd - the better! The amount of suspense in this movie sometimes reaches almost unpleasant levels. It also boasts the greatest number of effective jolts that I remember ever having seen.2.Gore! You won't believe how gory &amp; disturbing this film is! Forget that no-guts CABIN FEVER splatter-wannabe: this is the stuff the gorehounds' dreams are made of. Nispel uses gore wisely, never exaggerating, never showing too much &amp; making it into a comedy or ridicule - the gore in TCM only adds to the terror, making the chainsaw threat real, tangible.3.The new, upgraded Leatherface just rules! He is unstoppable killing machine, bigger, meaner &amp; FASTER than good old Gunnar, and this time he is devoid of all the grotesquerie and pathos and silliness of the original Leatherface, which is good for producing terror, but on the other hand, it makes his character shallow &amp; simple, almost like a Jason with a chainsaw.4.R. Lee Ermey is unbearably unpleasant &amp; scary in this= one of the greatest sicko characters to ever appear in a horror movie: I can already see him enter the Fangoria Hall of Fame [or is he already there?] &amp; probably winning the award for the best male supporting role in the Chainsaw awards. Pure genius.5.Jessica Biel is the epitome of 'hot'! She's also a decent actress, &amp; the rest of the actors also do an unexpectedly good job. No complaints in that department.Here are also some reasons why I think this movie is, in spite of its qualities, still far away from the genius of Hooper's original:1.It is devoid of the all-pervading sense of apocalypse &amp; doom that graced the TCM '74. All the psychological nuances, sociological implications, ideological, sexual &amp; other tensions are also gone, for the sake of making the new version pure rollercoaster joyride through Hell with no subtext at all. It is also mostly devoid of Hooper's sense of black humor &amp; wit [nothing here comes close to the 'Look what your brother did to the door!' moments].2.One of my biggest complaints about the new TCM is that they never provide any background for the family: actually, I assume they are a family, but we never ever learn what their relations are = for all we're told or allowed to see, they may be just a community of psychos living together. The two women and a child are unnecessary additions that serve no purpose in the film. On the other hand, providing an 'explanation' for Leatherface's masks, and showing his face, was completely pointless and even stupid.3.Nispel's video-clip background creeps in unnecessary additions, like the haze in the middle of a sunny August day, just so as to make rays of the sun through the trees look 'more beautiful'. He does the same in the night shots, with pointless mist that hangs around the house: it's a silly cliché, just like the rain that comes later in the night. These kinds of visuals do nothing to enhance the movie - they do the contrary.4.The final half hour is well directed, it is suspenseful, it has great scary moments &amp; unexpected twists, but is cliched nevertheless. And the ending. It just doesn't have the punch, the culmination of nihilism &amp; apocalypse that Hooper had been masterfully building throughout his film. The silly epilogue is both implausible and cliched.Anyway, if you are willing to settle for a great, entertaining horror-ride that is far better than it had any right to be &amp; far more shocking &amp; gruesome than anyone could expect, then you know what to do when the movie opens. Hardcore R rated horror needs all the support it can get.The new TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE delivers! It is everything that HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES &amp; CABIN FEVER wanted to be, but weren't. This is the real meat, the real blood, the real terror, &amp; the most fun you're likely to have watching any horror in the cinemas this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow.I saw a preview screening of this film, and let me tell you, I was not expecting much. With this whole rash of bad studio horror films (Jeepers Creepers 1&amp;2, House of the Dead, etc) or really bad independents (House of 1000 Corpses) this movie did what few recent horror films have been able to do to me for much of my teenaged life, it actually scared me, quite a bit. Good scares, too, they didn't hit exactly when you thought they would, or in the way you thought. The characters, for the most part, made decent decisions, they weren't incredibly stupid, just unfortunate. That's the mark of a good horror movie: It loses those stupid plot contrivances of the really dumb characters that make really terrible choices in order for the scare to work. In this one, it seemed like no matter what they did, things just went wrong for the characters, and that makes it so much scarier.It was incredibly gruesome and shot quite well, and really held the atmosphere. I was definitely impressed. So if you're into horror, or want some good scares, definitely give this one a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reasonable remake. WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marcus Nispel's remake of TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE had a preview last night in London and I was amongst the audience.As such, remakes seldom do well compared to the original. The exception to the rule in my view was John Singleton's superior version of SHAFT, which retained the style and ideals of the original blaxploitation classic whilst updating it for a post-hip New Wave filmmaking appeal.Tobe Hooper's original film was a hard act to follow and indeed the sequels are still amongst the most discussed movies amongst horror film fans. The big challenge is how do you try and incorporate the interpretation of a horror film in today's film-making terms whilst still managing to keep the power and relentlessness of the original?Well,on a personal note, I do have mixed feelings about it, but at the end of the day, the result on screen isn't half bad and does make you jump at least a couple of times in the film. Inevitably, the 'BASED ON A TRUE STORY' doesn't quite hit as hard these days, as Hooper openly admits on the TCM DVD commentary to Daniel Pearl that the real true story is about Ed Gein, which is more or less common knowledge.After a BLAIR-WITCH type opening, the film settles into the events of August 18th 1973 and the sound of SWEET HOME ALABAMA as a group of teens drive along. They almost knock down a young woman who seems to be sleepwalking and decide to pick her up. So begins this remake.....Most people will probably be dismissive of the virtues of a remake and as a fan of the original film myself, I am probably in that frame of mind whenever anybody does something like this. Indeed, I was probably as cynical before seeing it last night. However, who's to say whether one version of a film is superior to another? Theatre critics don't complain about the countless Hamlets or Richard IIIs portrayed on screen, Dracula has been portrayed on screen more times than any other character and audiences don't mind watching Stallone or Schwarzenegger in different guises of similar action characters.One thing about this remake that I am sure others will tap into is that fans familiar with the original film will try and look for where the key moments that made them jumpy in the original film and thus try to preempt and anticipate the shocks. Even so, there are some moments in here that did do their job, purely on horror movie terms and the sort of thing you would expect to queue up and see if you were watching a totally brand-new horror film.Summing up, TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE 2003 is an admirable enough attempt to remake a popular horror classic and thanks to Daniel Pearl's cinematography keeps sufficient atmosphere to rival the original, even if some of the original's uniqueness remains with the 1974 movie. The lead group of actors do reasonably well and give good performances for a horror film not unlike those in CABIN FEVER.Sit back and enjoy the show.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It wasn't a great movie but at the same time, it wasn't a bad one either. It was okay. Not the greatest remake. A lot of the acting, in my opinion, was not done well. Especially with the girls, Pepper and Erin. Jessica Biel was better in a way, there were some parts of her role that came out. But Pepper just plain sucked as a character, she was too much of a slut and a lot of her acting was done poorly.Now for the guys role, Kemper died way too early in the movie. John Tucker's character Morgan was too much of a Stoner. I'm sorry but it's the same damn thing in every remake, there's always some Stoner retard. Mike Vogel's character should have been alive later in the movie. And plus the scene where Andy faces off against Leatherface, it should have had more action in it. At least something instead of him getting his leg chopped off while running. Really dumb.On the other hand though, Leatherface was still good. Not great but good. I have seen some better Leatherface's. But still brutal as he was in past Texas Chainsaw Massacre's and later remakes. Sheriff Hoyt was awesome and probably by far the best role in the movie. R. Lee Ermey was great for the role. There was some good twisted parts so if your into twisted yet gory horror movies, I'd give this a try but watch the original first if you haven't seen it yet. Then compare the two.</fullReview>

I, for one, was utterly annoyed with late Mr. Ebert's review, for whom I have utmost respect, where he awarded this movie- a zero. It's so unfair because I believe this film has achieved it's aim effortlessly... It's highly engrossing, plot moves rather fast, the actors do OK job, except for fantastic Ms. Biel, who screams her lungs out and is also very easy on the eyes. This movie made me feel just like a good, uncompromising horror ought to. I felt anxious and scared for the protagonists, with suspension stemming from the fact that we know so little of the movie's horrific antagonist, who deals with intruders in no-non sense matter. Other undertones of creepy family surviving in the middle of no where and general feeling of danger hoovering over you the entire film are very well established in my opinion. It's scary, it's brutal, it's uncompromising just how we like 'em.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original had a horrifying integrity. This remake is, of course, an opportunistic cash grab. The build-up in the early stages is surprisingly decent - a masturbatory pull-back through a gunshot wound aside - and there's plenty of off-kilter scene setting around the town. It didn't take long, though, for the realisation to kick in that I'd been suckered into watching yet another glossy slasher flick in which a good-looking cast gets jumped on at random points. Once the violence kicks in, all interest disappears. This is a disgusting movie, but not a scary one: predictably it goes further with the gore than the original ever did, yet it muffs that film's most horrifying moments: the slamming door, the meat hook, the escape from the house, the family get-together. Come the unlikely finale it's all become feverishly overbaked, thanks in no small part to R. Lee Ermey's over-the-top turn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of Horror movies, but believe it or not, this is the only version of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre that I ever liked. The reason is simple, for this one, they actually got a real cast that include two of my favorite actors and the gorgeous Jessica Biel. This story isn't any different than the other ones. A bunch of friends on a road trip take a wrong turn and find themselves being hunted by a mad man. The film is full of gore, bad jokes, and beautiful people, it's really nothing out of the ordinary, except for the cast. Great actors can make anything entertaining, even the most bland and repetitive film gets new life when you introduce a cast like this. Three extremely talented and under appreciated actors, give support to the less experienced cast members, and while much of the film was focused on Biel and Leatherface, you could still see the influence of the veteran stars on the rest of this cast. If you don't like Horror, this film won't change your mind. If you're looking for originality, you won't find it here. If you're looking for some good performances from a very talented cast, that is something The remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre will give you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sickening mean-spirit combined with an overwhelming amount of gore to cover up the holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has no problem clobbering and assaulting its optimistic viewers with stifling meanness and a begrudging sense of miserableness to the point of making the entire thing unenjoyable and tiresome. Director Marcus Nispel concocts the most unfaithful, truly melancholic remake to Tobe Hooper's iconic masterwork from 1974, which paved the way for the newborn genre of horror. The only thing this remake paves is the road to more impenetrable cynicism and gore in modern horror films.The film was released by Platinum Dunes, the company owned by noted director/producer Michael Bay, who consistent readers know I do not think too highly of. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre plays exactly like the horror film he'd make if he got a hold of the camera. Make no character worth rooting for, and oversimplify every aspect of filmmaking to the bare basics, ushering in nothing but simplicity and bargain basement fare. That's what this film specializes in.Our story begins by showing us marginally effective black and white newsreel footage that tells us that a group of fine young souls were murdered in a sadistic fashion in the dead of August of 1973. We then cut to that exact time, where the teenagers in question, Erin (Jessica Biel), her boyfriend Kemper (Eric Balfour), Morgan (Jonathan Tucker), Andy (Mike Vogel), and Pepper (Erica Leerhsen), are heading out to a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert after smuggling out more marijuana than there was at Woodstock during their vacation in Mexico. They see a young woman (Lauren German) walking aimlessly on the road, and foolishly decide to pick her up and ask her what she is doing walking on a deserted road alone. The woman rambles incoherently about someone who will kill them and tried to kill her before pulling a gun from up her skirt and shooting herself in the head.Now our gang of troublemakers are in a lovely spot. After picking up a hitchhiker for really no reason at all, they now have a nice bullet hole through their trunk window and a corpse of an unknown woman slumped over in their car. The five stop at a store, in the middle of sheer nowhere, only to be "assisted" by the unreliable elderly working there, and continue driving through the desolate, empty countryside with a corpse sittin' pretty in their backseat. The woman working the counter calls the sheriff and tells them he will meet them at the local mill, so they head up there to see what they can find. They finally reach the mill, and this is where the typical thriller formula sets in. A few of the teens go one way, the others remain where they are, and then discover they will be helpless victims very, very quickly by Leatherface, who in over thirty years, hasn't changed a lick. He still wields a chainsaw, still wears a real face for a mask, and still possesses the incredibly complex skill of running while swinging a large and heavy chainsaw.The first act establishes nothing more than Nispel's fine sense of atmosphere, and how credible suspense is absent and traded in for gore, torture, and mutilation. The second and third tirelessly depict peril and torture in a way that isn't so much entertaining or frightening, but rather boring, predictable, and exhaustively mean-spirited. The blood-curdling screams of the pretty young leads wearies on the mind, and the presence of gore over suspense really grate on any hope this film has to be frightening or even convincing.Every character is artificially captured here. Not only are the leads just remarkably unremarkable, but even Leatherface is desperately shortchanged here, barely even possessing the title of a villain. He revs his chainsaw quickly and knows how to run with it. And we're afraid of him. That's the extent of Leatherface in the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Not to mention, even when we see that many people in this town are behind Leatherface and just hold the attitude that everyone who comes in this town should be butchered and slaughtered, this numbs the whole experience into a gray sea of nihilism that leave us bitter and petrified souls.I'm greatly reminded of Greg McLean's Wolf Creek, a similar film with similar content, only done much better. While at times the film was excessive in its display of torture and mutilation, there was a terrific style and enigma to that film that this one greatly lacks. Its villain wasn't as faceless, its suspense was present and very, very creepy, and throughout the film, it intensified rather than stew in its own sourness. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is more along the lines of Hostel: Part II, where the whole thing becomes tiresome even if you do crave torturous acts in your films.Upon watching this film, I left the room cold, bitter, and slightly depressed at what I had just watched. Perhaps that was the goal of Nipsel and Scott Kosar, the film's writer. It's an ugly, mean-spirited little exercise that unsuccessfully duplicated Tobe Hooper's classic that was classic for the reason why this is not; it was a disciplined picture. It was nuanced, gritty, and very, very effective. This film fuels the reason why so many horror films can not resist killing of everyone and not developing anyone. We voice what we want to see with the money we give over at the counter of the multiplex or the electronics store, and if we keep paying for films like these, we will be the only ones to blame for the influx of lesser content that offers nothing more than meets the eye. I guess you could say, I was cold, bitter, and slightly depressed for reasons other than what the film I watched presented me with.Starring: Jessica Biel, Eric Balfour, Erica Leerhsen, Jonathan Tucker, Mike Vogel, and R. Lee Ermey. Directed by: Marcus Nipsel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Outweighs the Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing I really enjoyed about this remake was that it added various new elements to the story. Although not all of these elements were great, at least they were something new. However, there were quite a few problems with the film. Besides the typical stupidness of the characters in horror movies, the biggest problem I found was the scare level. This film tried to capture the feel and look of the original, but it definitely did not succeed. Instead of going for scares using the story, it reverted to using gore which did not help. At times I felt like I was watching a slasher film. In addition, there were some elements that were way overused. For example, the meat hook was used much too often. Maybe it is just me, but it also seemed like every person the victims met were part of the family trying to kill them. I was hoping this would be the last movie in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre series, but I just saw that yet another one is coming out in a year or two, this time in 3d! Ho-hum.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film back when it came out (and I was like what 11 years old) and thought it was great. At that time I was young and my knowledge of film was very limited. I rewatched it and did enjoy it, but it is obvious that originality is pretty much nowhere to be seen. I liked the inside of the house and it's look, but at times the cinematography was grating and I didn't particularly like the lighting and colors used. Jessica Biel is fucken hot, and her running around in that tight, small shirt was awesome, but her chase scene at the end still got way too repetitive. Surprisingly, I found the 2006 film "The Beginning" more tense and better directed, and overall more satisfying (although that film's climax also left more to be desired). Still, solid watch for a late night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this movie came out in theatres, I was too young to see it. I heard it was based on a true story. But it is actually very loosely based on the real life serial murderer Ed Gein. He also skinned people and made clothes and furniture out of the and he even wore those clothes. That is what scared the hell out of me and that is what makes the movie so scary. The original was a classic, and that movie scare also scared the hell out of me. But in my opinion, I like this version better. That is not to say that I do not like the original, because I do, I just think this version is better. I also seen some horror films that were more appalling than this one (ie. The Human Centipede, which I just saw last night). And ones that were not scary at all, Signs and the Sixth Sense.If you want to see a film that has lots of scares chills and thrills, I recommend the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Although it might make some people turn white. In other words, not for the faint-hearted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even Better than the Original!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some remakes actually surpass their originals. This is one of those remakes. the original 1974 classic was great but this film actually surpasses it in almost every way possible. the atmosphere is darker and much more gritty; the death scenes are way cooler (the chainsaw is used to gruesome, terrific effect when used); the acting is beyond Oscar worthy. R. Lee Ermy as the sadistic "sheriff" steals the show for me though.Overall this remake is WAY better than all the sequels and even the original. 10 out of 10. wish i could rate it higher. I hope this review is useful. words cannot describe how beautiful this movie is. Ir's one of those rare films that come along like once in a lifetime that surpass all others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I once saw a video on Facebook that got reported and pulled quickly. In the video was a man on a bicycle who is stopped at an intersection. He is in his helmet and pads and an 18 wheeler pulls up along side, The driver doesn't see the cyclist and starts to make a left turn and slowly the cyclist is taken under the wheels and ripped into a pulpy mess.The disgust, awe, shock, dismay and then unsettled feeling that lasted for hours and glimpsed again for days later at seeing life snuffed out so easily and nonchalantly is the feeling that was left with me from this movie.Jennifer Biel acts so terrified that all semblance of normality is gone. She doesn't notice her nose is streaming down into her mouth or the nasty muckiness that is smeared all over her face. She is screaming in terror and running for her life. None of the perfect make-up and appearance of Jennifer Love-Hewitt as she runs in ... Last Summer... or so many other so called horror movies where the actresses avoid all but a well placed spot of blood on their perfectly made up faces. No. Death and horror is a nasty dirty business.If you want to hold to the 1970's purity of the original that I've read in other reviews then avoid this film. If you are a casual horror watcher then this is not your cup of tea. If you want to be scared and left with the feeling that life is fleeting and too easily snuffed then this is an experience for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give a 10 here. My personal opinion is that this is one of the best remakes ever(at least when it comes to horror films). Actually is one of my favorite horror movies of all times. I could watch it over and over again. The duration is 98 minutes and we have 80 minutes (maybe more) full of action. Near the end we have much running which makes the movie even better and it is something that actually the original movie didn't have. I am not trying to compare. I'm just saying that if you watched the original movie and you liked it..then you're going to love this. And if i try to compare this with other horror movies of the decade, it is easily one of the best. Moreover, if you're new to horror movies..i wouldn't suggest watching this alone. Get some snacks, invite some friends and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing New To Offer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, this definitely had effort put in it, which is more than you can say for other bad movies. This was, indeed, a bad movie (and I do mean baaaaaad), but at the same time, it wasn't god-awful. The acting wasn't horrible, the screenplay wasn't terrible, and the killers weren't cheesy or over-the-top. But it was still bad. The villains are a good place to start. The problem with most post-Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1970's version) villains is that they are Leatherface with a different mask. This includes everyone from 1977's The Hills Have Eyes to Friday the 13th to Halloween. This version of the Texas Chain Saw Massacre, while being fundamentally faithful to the original villain, could have attempted a more creative villain. The other villains had little in common with the original. They were not extremely poorly written, but there was not enough to them to make them their own characters, unlike in the original. (I would like to take this moment to point out the fact that I am not just bashing this movie for being unlike the original. I did actually see the remake before the original.) The list of clichés was increased beyond what was established in the original. Which I hated. It made the film become extremely predictable, which lowered the scare factor substantially. There were several character alterations in this film and I have mixed feelings about them. In the original, the hitchhiker was a member of the family that attempted to kill the travelers. In this one, the hitchhiker was a victim who commits suicide in the van. I was not a fan of this change because I felt like this change was made only to increase the gore in the movie rather than for any significant plot movements. However, I did appreciate the fact that there was a police officer who was a member of the family. Even as its own movie (disregarding the original version entirely) this remake has nothing new to offer to the audiences. The characters are stereotypical and the actors are relatively wooden, if not terrible actors. There is little action worth watching and not much happens that is outside the audience's expectation. This isn't the worst movie ever made. It isn't even the worst remake ever made. But it is still a very bad movie. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet Home Texas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Believe it or not, I was solely looking forward to the remake/reboot of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre back in 2003. The 1974 original is still an absolute classic, albeit low budget/outdated if one were to watch today. And the producers/director and writer(s) didn't let me down this time around.Who knows why they chose to set the movie in the early 1970s and it really didn't add to the story, other than no one having a cell phone to call for help. (Not that it mattered; chances are, they would've wrote in that they didn't have cell coverage in the areas they were at.) Five young adults are headed through the Texas back roads to a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert in 1973 when they encounter a very scared woman alongside the road. While "doing the right thing," they pick her up, but when original five head back towards where the hitchhiker is scared to return to, she (literally) blows her own brains out with a concealed weapon.Of course, this freaks out the rest and they stop off at a fly/pig infested general store where they encounter one of the soon-to-be many stranger small-Texas townies. In order to report this, or get rid of the corpse in their van, they must meet the oohhh-scary sheriff in some isolated farm. From there, it's basically clear: you're in store for what the movie title suggests? ?Yadda, Yadda, Yadda, it's girl VS. Leatherface, the chainsaw-wielding deformed son of the crazy town-folk. I won't give away the finale, but I liked it a lot. Not only does it seemingly end on one climax, it continues with an even more satisfyingly revenge-bent/rescue that alters all the copy-cats of the "Wrong-Turn" movies.Though some of the movie is slow and it's yet another remake/reboot/back-road story, it's held up by strong performances/dialogue by the cast and contains a lot of suspense, realism and terror with the isolation of the old structures. The creators had a lot of "scary" sets to work with, and they took full advantage of the surroundings. Highly recommended for horror fans.Side Note: Believe it or not, this movie introduced me to the song, Sweet Home Alabama by Lynyrd Skynyrd. Much like how Mr. Sandman in Halloween II (1981) or Chick Habit in Death Proof (Grindhouse) freaked me out, this did, too. Every time I hear Sweet Home Alabama, I think of the opening to this movie and gives me the urge to revisit this above-average horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The TCM was an excellent remake, it gets you on the edge of you seat, or even better, hiding under it! So suspenseful, there is a lot of chase scenes which was very amusing. The kills weren't too bloody, but they were enough to satisfy me. Although Pepper's death was stupid. Nice story plot, characters and not spending too much time on one thing. (Unlike the original, or should I say The Boring Chainsaw Massacre)Leatherface was very creepy and so was his family, were they psychos or what? It was entertaining to see Leatherface's basement and where he butchers and cuts people up.Nice ending to the movie. I personally loved it, most of the time it was dark so it gave more of a creepy mood. Pretty damn good film. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre A Decent Horror Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a decent horror remake better than most of them but not great. Director Marcus Nispel has done an admirable job in making this remake giving audiences for the most part what they expect from one of the movies just the right amount of sick brutal deaths, suspense, some character development, a little humor, and a scary villain named Thomas Hewitt a deformed man better known as Leatherface a ruthless killer whose weapon of choice just happens to be a chainsaw. The cast are good in their roles including Jessica Biel, Jonathan Tucker, Erica Leeherson, Mike Vogel, Erica Balfour, and R. Lee Ermey as a psychopathic Sheriff whose a member of the Hewitt family. Ermey makes the best of his part as one of the deranged villains a cannibal with a taste for homicidal tendencies. Biel, Tucker, Leerherson, Vogel, and Balfour are solid as their characters who find themselves far from home in a desperate fight for survival. Leeherson, Vogel, and especially Balfour don't have a lot of screen time because their roles are cut a bit short but they're decent none the less. Andrew Bryniarski is admirable as Leatherface in a non-speaking role but he makes the character scary, intimidating, and a ruthless killer with no conscience, remorse, or empathy for any poor soul who wanders into his territory. The rest of the supporting cast of relatively unknown actors/actresses are believable in their small parts in the movie which is a good thing. The film was a little slow in the beginning but once the first friend in the group is killed it's pretty much non stop horror violence, chases, and narrow escapes from there. There is a little suspense but the movie could've been better with more of it. The dialogue wasn't the greatest at times and the lack of character development weighed the film down a little but it's still not that bad. There are changes from the original one that came out a long time ago but I thought those changes were for the better. Overall the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a decent remake with enough brutal violence/deaths, suspense, chases, some humor, and good performances by the cast which makes this an above average horror remake to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If there'd never been the original...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...this version of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" ("TCM2003") might end up more highly regarded, given Hooper's implicit blessing by producing. As it is, "TCM2003" holds one's attention primarily by virtue (if that's the right word) of seeing what screenwriter Scott "The Crazies (2010)" Kosar does differently, which is a fair amount, not all of which works. But, really, did you expect something else? With reasonably solid leads in Jessica "Ulee's Gold" Biel, Eric "The Spirit" Balfour, Erica "Blair Witch 2" Leerhsen, Mike "Cloverfield" Vogel, and Jonathan "Hostage" Tucker, along with adequately picaresque baddies like R. Lee "Full Metal Jacket" Ermey and hulking up-and-comer Andrew "I'm a bodybuilder!" Bryniarski, the film can't be faulted for its acting. Production values are equally impressive, especially the slick production design and art direction by relative newbies Greg Blair and Scott Gallagher respectively. The true stroke of brilliance, though, was bringing in the original masterpiece's DP, Daniel "I've done more music videos than you could possibly imagine" Pearl to deliver some outstanding camera-work.Beyond that, director Marcus "Hey, I do music videos, too!" Nispel is simply too pedestrian to match Tobe Hooper's inspired insanity, or to raise Kosar's workmanlike script to fearful heights. Kosar was wise not to update the story to modern times, since the heightened connectivity of the Internet, cell phones, Ipods and the like would "out" the demented Hewitt clan in record time, not to mention the sophisticated forensics of the local CSI unit. Various anachronisms pop up, which I'll leave to the reader to discover, and a few "oh, c'mons!" rankle credulity, but those aren't the main flaws of "TCM2003." It's more just the overall lack of...tension. The original is an internationally recognized genre classic that has a gritty, desolate feel to it that the remake simply cannot match. Losing the infamous "dinner scene" doesn't help, nor do the copious helpings of gore that the original studiously avoided. Suggestion has always been the better part of terror (cf. "Funny Games"), so when you do things like unmask the main bad guy, something vital is lost. Younger audiences unfamiliar with the original may be satisfied, but the rest of us remain unimpressed.Nowhere near as interesting as the Savini remake of George A. Romero's seminal classic "Night of the Living Dead," but fortunately nowhere near as loathsome as the repellent and unnecessary "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning," (which ought to be rated much lower than it currently is here on the IMDb), "TCM2003" will remain one of the less offensive remakes in Hollywood's long history of strip mining itself. That's not much to recommend it, but at least it serves to remind callow viewers that the original exists.It's sad, though, to note that more IMDbers have seen and rated "TCM2003" than Hooper's seminal nightmare. Hopefully, time will change that state of affairs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never expected this remake to be this good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In October of 1974, before 'Black Christmas' and 'Halloween' came this potent little low budget treasure from the Golden Age of horror cinema. Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' is considered to be the first slasher film, but the original 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' out-shined that film in terms of shock value and raw horror. Before these slasher films with beautiful young people who look like they were taken from off the runway, million dollar budgets, and grade A production values, the sub-genre was made up of films that were ground more in reality and some, like this film, were real down and dirty. But then after "Psycho' was remade it wouldn't be long before it happened to other classic horror films and in 2003, almost 30 years after the original was released, we got a remake of Tobe Hooper's seminal slasher flick and fans were outraged. But unlike the new 'Psycho,' this one received far more praise and did pretty darn well for itself in the money-making department.Pros: Crisp and beautiful cinematography. Equally eye-pleasing scenery. Great performances from all involved. Impressive job on the production design. Director Nispel gets some great shots and keeps things moving and scary. Some real jaw-dropping scenes and images. Fast-paced. The Hewitt's make for a great bunch of creeps. A good horror score that suits the film's events to a T.Cons: Lacks the raw power of the original. This may be just my opinion, but I think it was a mistake to let us see Leatherface's real face. It's better if we have to imagine what it looks like.Final thoughts: Whoa! This remake sure packs a wallop. Of course it can't beat the original, but it doesn't try to. It holds it's own and is one of the most satisfying of the remakes of one of the classics.My rating: 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In a way, it kinda was needed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the remakes today are deemed unnecessary by fans and critics. In some ways, that is true. But the counter for this argument IMO is the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake. Let's face it, the series was going downhill. The first is an obvious classic, the second is kinda fun, but lacking, the third was just a little better, but the fourth movie? Don't get me started.Thankfully this movie came along and brought back the brutality that the movies are supposed to be about. The failed attempt at humor from the 4th movie is gone, nothing more than a sense of dread for the main characters. The family is once again scary as well. R Lee Emery gives a fine performance, almost on par with Sgt. Hartman! And Leatherface, man did they improve him. Not the child minded character or the cross dressing type he was portrayed as previously. Just a guy who goes bananas with his tools when he sees an unsuspecting victim. Gore is something people say is never necessary for a movie, but in this movie's case it works. It really adds to the dread for this movie. I can never forget the scene the guy with his leg recently chopped off being taken downstairs by Leatherface, trying to grab onto the wall and having his fingernails ripped out in the process. *Shudder*So really IMO, this did to the TCM series what Batman Begins did to the Batman series. Sounds a little odd I know, but watch the sequels after the first movie and watch this. You'll see the improvement</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lee Ermey is scarier than Leatherface...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...and that's this remake's redeeming quality.I could've easily seen this remake a movie standing on its on own two legs with Ermey as the star villain and writing Leatherface completely out of the script and calling it something else, but that perhaps would've been too risky for Hollywood. Better to cash in on a well-known franchise, sadly.Ermey does his typical character, his pivotal role of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman from "Full Metal Jacket", but jacked up on acid. He may be forgiven for it because he does it so well and steals every scene he's featured in.On the other hand, the remakes Leatherface is little more than a movie monster. Whereas the original made us see that there is a real human behind the dead skin mask.The original Leatherface was a character of great strength and size but limited intellect. The scary, and sad, thing about him is that you could easily see him growing up - well, relatively normal - under other circumstances.The remake's Leatherface is supernatural. Possessing superhuman strength he stops at nothing, not even getting his armed hacked off. He just pause to shake the severed limb free off the chainsaw so he can resume the hunt for human prey. Personally, I felt the Leatherface part of the movie is the weakest.All in all, the remake does feel prettied up. The female lead is hotter, the kids are cooler, and Leatherface is more monstrous. Lost somewhere is the genuinely creepy atmosphere from from the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake that;s actually good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this is a "re-imagining" (which is a cop-out word that means "remake") than "Leatherface-Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 3" is also a re-imagining and so is "Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre" for that matter. They did the same thing here that they did with Part 3 and 4, but better. They took the central character of old "Leather", gave him a new family unit and nodded Tobe Hooper's original to various degrees along the way. Apart from the basic premise of "stranded kids vs. nutty family", this movie mostly showcased new material. So why is it called a re-imagining i.e. remake? Because mainstream audiences are more likely to go see that than a film called "Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 5", which let's face it...this is what this movie really is.I'd admit I was a bit skeptical at first after I heard they were remaking the first one but when I watched I really liked it definitely the 2nd best out of the entire series, the first one being the best of course. For anybody familiar with the Texas franchise, the chain of events found here won't surprise you. Teens + Texas + Cannibal Family = mucho trouble. For those of you who know the original so well, be prepared to be taken for a couple of loops-the-loops with this update because the chain of events is a different one starting with the nature of the hitchhiker (played by Laura German) character and beyond. That pleased me. I didn't want to see the same old jive again, and I didn't. The flick had its own story to tell, expanded upon ideas found in the original and took me on a tension-filled no-messing around with the cheese violent ride. Even though this doesn't have the grainy feel the original had (face it what movie does these days) I liked it, the setting was just as creepy and I liked the fact that they upped the gore factor in this one as well and another thing I liked that Leatherface was scary again Bryniarski is the first Leatherface actor that brought the compelling emotion of "resentment" to the character. I felt that was his motivation when it came to "why" he wanted to butcher these teens and that added a whole new visceral layer to the proceedings. It's obvious that Bryniarski really sank his teeth into the part, I heard he went full on "method" on set (oinking like a pig in a corner) and it showed in his arresting performance. Physically, even his tacky mask managed to work since it was always bathed in the shadows. My other favorite loony had to be the Sheriff played to a T by R. Lee Ermey. The role brought lunacy in at its max and much appreciated dark comic tones. Nobody does it like Ermey! Like NOBODY! Think his "Full Metal Jacket" character but on acid.Jessica Biel was awesome in this flick she gave her character real raw emotion and plus I loved her chase scenes in that white vest top (espeially when it rained) and her tight jeans, she looked great, Jonathan Tucker (Morgan) was a delight as the straight shooter hippie boy. His vulnerability when faced with Ermey was great. Eric Balfour (Kemper) was average as Jessica's boyfriend and she could do so much better, makes you wonder why is she with this loser. Erica Leerhsen was another stunning looking woman and gave a sympathetic and credible performance. Mike Vogel (Andy) was nice to look at, very sexy and did his part well, I really felt for his character I would have liked him to have been in it more and have a bigger part as he was the best looking out of all the men in this movie Andrew Bryniarski (Leatherface) was quite an imposing and frightening figure as Leatherface. R. Lee Ermey (Sheriff Hoyt) as I already pretty much said earlier was astounding this movie wouldn't have been the same without him.All in all the franchise well and truly bounced back with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That film had scare so much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh my god. That film is the best horror movie I've ever seen. The cast, all the scenes, the killer all in this movie is excellent. It starts very good and finish very good. Leatherface or Thomas Hewitt (who played by Andrew Bryniarski) is the best killer of all time, in my opinion, after Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger. This film, also, focuses in the family of the killer and all the member of that family are crazy. Furthermore, it's really scary with a lot of violence and gore. Some scenes made me to close my eyes. And the cast is nice. Jessica Biel (Erin) is excellent and is my favourite actress and she's a good actress. Also, Erica Leerhsen, Mike Vogel, Jonathan Tucker, and my favorite Eric Balfour are good in their roles. I put in "The Texas chainsaw massacre" 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What the f*ck is this? who's hamster wheel of a brain started turning one day, making them think "hmmm, Im gonna remake Texas Chainsaw Massacre only this time its gonna suck" .... Marcus Nispel, thats who! Firstly, who's idea was it to appoint a guy who directs music videos to direct the remake of a classic horror movie? Firstly, they screwed the group of teens up big time. Instead of the original cast, which consisted of the protagonist (Sally), the hippie (Jerry), the disabled outcast (Franklin), the "pretty-boy" type (Kirk) and the squirrelly girl who's obsessed to do it with the pretty-boy (Pam). But this, come on. They're all stone rs except Erin (Jessica Biel). THat tells me everyone except her is going to die. And where did they get some of these names? Have you ever met anyone named Kemper? or you ever asked a girl out named Pepper? Sounds more like a knock off of some Saturday morning cartoon. Leatherface isn't even the bumbling idiot he is in the original TCM or the sequels, in this hes a serious serial killer. The insane family wasn't even funny in this one, they were dead serious. Also, we get the meat-hook concept, you don't have to show the guy hanging there every 2 minutes getting another body part chopped off or something. We get it already. The ONLY reasons I gave this movie 2/10 was A) There's no 0 and B) R. Lee Ermey was in this movie, and hes always a good actor. Him playing the insane Sheriff Hoyt was the only reason I kept watching.Stick to your day job Marcus, or next time you decide to make a movie, don't trash an already classic one</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the original, but a very good remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, as I said in the summary, it's not as good as the original, but it's still very good.It starts with Erin (Jessica Biel), Pepper (Erica Leehrsen), Andy (Mike Vogel), Morgan (Jonathan Tucker) and Kemper(Eric Balfour), five teenagers on their way to a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert (Great start because I love Lynyrd Skynyrd). They pick up a teenage girl (Lauren German) who ends up shooting herself in the mouth and that's where it all starts to go wrong. They try and find the sheriff but everything becomes disastrous. Later, they encounter Thomas Hewitt/Leatherface (Andrew Bryniarski), a chainsaw wielding maniac intent on killing them all. Although Luda Mae tries to tell Erin that Leatherface is basically misunderstood, he's pretty scary and the teenagers die in some pretty gruesome ways, including Erin having to stab Andy to put him out of his misery.Andrew Bryniarski is not as good as the original Leatherface Gunnar Hansen, but he does a pretty good job. Jessica Biel who plays Erin is not as good as Marilyn Burns as Sally Hardesty but I think she does a pretty good job as well. Also in the cast is R Lee Ermey, a 'sheriff' who adds a nice touch to the movie.All in all it's a very good movie which I very much enjoyed. It still keeps to the original - old man, chainsaw, meat hook, heroin, nasty deaths - but it adds some new elements as well, which I liked. Sure, it's not as good as the original, but definitely worth the watch. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The remake of the cult classic that undoubtedly was the catalyst for countless viewers recoiling in disgust, remains faithful to the time-worn yet dependable formula with deliciously appalling results.The formula: put a few good-looking teens in a remote location and one by one knock them off in this grisly, gratuitous, disgusting, over-the-top, exhilaratingly campy remake. Of course the plot is horrible. Of course the violence is exceedingly graphic. But the performances were not that bad at all. As a matter of fact, the standout performance was from none other than the Sheriff, R.Lee Ermy who was just wonderful!!! Please be advised that this film has no social redeeming value whatsoever. It is a slasher film and if you can't tell that merely by the title of the film, then you deserve what you get.But for those of us out here with that always interesting, unorthodox sense of humor, this was quite simply a BLAST!!!!!! It was totally disgusting and equally wonderful. Not at all for the squeamish, this is a DVD that is a MUST if you indeed care about your movie collection running the gamut from the absurd to the sublime!!!! I LOVED IT!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The chainsaw goes zzzz.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I almost did the same thing. It's sad that with all the gore and the close up shots of a**, that this remake doesn't have any gas. A girl blows her head off, a guy gets his leg cut off, another guy has his face removed, and Leatherface loses an arm; all in all, the movie has lost it's head. This is what happens, nine times out of ten, when you give a music video director the chance to direct a feature. Eric Belfour, Jessica Biel, and Erica Leerhsen aren't given much more than screaming. The oddest choice may be in not updating the movie, the whole going to see Lynyrd Skynyrd subplot is lifeless, and there seems to be no reason as to why this is done, besides the fact that the original was made in the seventies. Blood crazy kids may like this new version, with it's pathetic abused back story for Leatherface, but the first cut is the deepest.P.S. As for that close up of Biel's behind, I can't help but sing, "Lord have mercy Jessie's got her blue jeans on."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*The Texas Chainsaw SPOILERS* In 1973, five young kids, Kemper (Eric Balfour), his non-supportive and frigid girlfriend Erin (the awful Jessica Biel, who makes every actor performing against her look like a consummate thespian), the horny Andy (Mike Vogel), the annoying Morgan (Jonathan Tucker) and the hitchhiker Pepper (Erica Leehrsen) are driving to Dallas, to see a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert; they decide to take a shocked woman (who is weirdly walking towards a place she later screams she doesn't absolutely want to return to - first flaw) on board, and a few miles down the road she kills herself with a gun she hid in her 'special place' (oh great, very innovative - NOT!).The guys want nothing more than report the death and get away as soon as they can, but because of Erin (and I want to stress it's all her fault) they end up wondering down the famed Hewitt residence, where Leatherface (Andrew Bryniarski) is just waiting for some fresh meat...The summary I wrote makes it sound very appealing, doesn't it? Too bad the movie is seriously bad, and I do mean it.The acting is very bad, (especially Jessica Biel, but except Mike Vogel), as are the glossy look everything has, the gaps in logic (skin disease WTF?), trailer trash Luda May (Marietta Marich), and the gore for gore's sake! I think that Morgan is supposed to be a stand-in for Franklin from the original, but there is this one problem where Morgan is annoying and boring, while Franklin was nice, sometimes whiny, but very very likable. I remember I was SHOCKED when he was chainsawed twice; I felt like I lost a friend. Here, I was angry that Erin let Morgan be killed, but I didn't particularly like him.You've got the 'hung on a meathook' scene wrong, too; the scares in the original meathook scene came from the fact that the girl wasn't weak or disabled, she could fight off any real killer, she was very healthy and strong, but Leatherface overpowered her, meaning he was unstoppable - hard to do it in the remake, where Leatherface has to incapacitate the character first with the chainsaw (which is weirdly pristine clean after cutting into people), thus making him weak without the chainsaw, and nothing more than a killer bully who hides behind an instrument of death, thus making him into a pathetic sissy; I just felt sorry for him in the remake, and hoped that he could slaughter the evil family (and Erin), let Andy and Morgan go (possibly Pepper too) and be happy, while in the original I did feel sorry for him (when the Cook berates him) but he was also one scary chainsaw-wielder, and preferred him as far away from me as possible.And Jesus Christ in the Holy Manger, couldn't you have let Andy live? (and killed Erin, as it was all her fault - just wanted to be as subtle as this remake turd).I turned the original TCM off various times (and rarely watched it start to finish) because it was really scary; I turned off this one various times, though, because I was utterly and completely bored (the first stop happened at the point where the kids try to decide what to do with the hitchhiker's body).In short, I was a fool, thinking this could be a good movie.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003): 3/10 (and that is just for Mike Vogel).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary? You Sure?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this when I was 15, alone, in the middle of the night. You can't honestly call this scary, but i really enjoyed it. I saw that it was based on the story of Ed Gein, who was a serial killer/Necrophiliac, (incidentally, the characters of Norman Bates of Psycho and Buffalo Bill of Silence of the Lambs were also based on him) and this was probably the scariest thing about this film. I read reviews saying how gruesome and violent, and just generally terrifying this film was, and i was in two minds about it. The first, my love for horror movies, gore, movies like A Nightmare On Elm Street, Dawn of the Dead, Hostel, SAW, Tenacious D and The Shining, and the second, the possibility that it would be too much for me. I would rate the horror about 3/10, purely for the uses of the meathooks, sledgehammer, and last but certainly not least, the chainsaw. This film is exciting, unpredictable, inspiring (not to kill people) and provocative. i would recommend this to anyone who like horror movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good horror, but not a good remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To many critics and fans across the world, Tobe Hooper's legendary debut film, "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", is one of the most influential and powerful horror films ever made. Based on the real case of Ed Gein, Hooper's film quickly gained its legendary status due to its original mix of gritty realism and nightmarish imagery that (intentionaly or not, it's up to debate) reinvented horror films and set the basis for the 70s new breed of independent horror filmmakers. Now, almost 30 years after the release of Hooper's film, producer Michael Bay and director Marcus Nispel attempt to bring the story to a new generation by giving new flesh to the classic story of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.The story, written by Scott Kosar, follows closely the original's basic plot, although of course, it adds it's own brand new touches in order to make it fresh and different. Set in the 70s, the plot follows a group of 5 friends in their travel across Texas on their way to a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert, as their last adventure before entering college. As the gang travel across the country, they notice a strange young woman walking down the road. Thinking she is a drugged hitchhiker, they pick her up and try to discover what is happening to her, but the effort proves to be futile as the woman kills herself with a gun she was carrying. In the middle of nowhere and without knowing what to do with the corpse, they try to find the county's sheriff, but soon they'll discover that in this rural Texan area, law is very different, and that the Saw is the family.The first noticeable characteristic of this remake of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", is the very different visual approach that director Marcus Nispel gives to the story. While Hooper's classic had a raw, gritty, and documentary-like look (most definitely due to low-budget); Nispel's film takes full advantage of its considerable bigger budget and delivers a visually arresting film with wonderful special effects and a brilliant work of the make-up department that really give new flesh to the legendary "Texas Chainsaw Massacre". This is not really a surprise, as Nispel's previous career consisted of excellent music videos, what is truly a surprise is the fact that this graphic approach to the story works remarkably well, and in fact gives the movie an identity of its own.While Nispel's direction of the film is very good, one can't say the same about Scott Kosar's modernization of Henkel and Hooper's original screenplay. Kosar's take on the story is appropriate, keeping faithful to the original's core plot while adding enough changes to make it fresh and different. While this is not really wrong in a remake (it's in fact, the proper way to remake a film), the problem is that Kosar's changes doesn't really work under the concept of what "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is, I mean, Kosar fails to capture the essence of the original and delivers simply another typical and clichéd story about teenagers getting slaughtered. To be fair, the story is suspenseful and intense, but looks boring and average when it gets the unavoidable comparison to the original.The cast is another of the film's traits that compares unfavorably to the original. While in the 1974 version the group of friends showed a naiveness and innocence that made them real and sympathetic, in the remake we get exactly the series of stereotypes that ironically have populated the horror genre after the original's success. The fact that the actors seem to be chosen based more on their looks than on their acting skills increases this notion of falseness that sadly makes the film less real. However, not everything is wrong in the film's cast, as the group of "villians" (led by a magnificent R. Lee Ermey) offer an arrange of excellent performances and wonderful scenes. Along with Ermey, Terrence Evans and Scott Martin Gershin deliver frightening and worthy displays of talent.As written above, the film's main problem is how it constantly compares unfavorably to the original. While Nispel does his best job as first time director, in the end, it's Koser's screenplay what ultimately brings the film down with its clichés and doses of political correctness (while far gorier, the movie feels oddly tamer than Hooper's). Still, I don't really think this is a completely bad horror movie, it's in fact better than most of the recent remakes; the problem I find is that by having the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" name, it forces an unnecessary and unfavorable comparison that takes down a film that probably would had been better without the relation to Hooper's classic.When watched as a remake, this new version of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" can feel like an insult to a classic film, but if one forgets for a second that this is a remake, there is good entertainment to get from it. The suspenseful and neat direction, as well as Ermey's classic performance really make the film worth a look, and definitely make up for the story's clichéd and average screenplay. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah yes The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake. What better example for the decay of the western horror genre then this weak excuse for of a movie. In just 98 minutes you'll see everything that is wrong with modern horror all neatly packed and presented as a remake of the 1973 classic.A group of teenagers traveling through the country to a concert pick up an abused and terrified girl wondering aimlessly on the road. They decide to search for help and set off to the nearest town, the girl begs them and warns them not to go there. Which is quite weird since before meeting them she was going in exactly the same direction. Soon after that she conveniently pulls out a gun from nowhere and shoots herself in the head. The sequence itself was the only really catching scene in the movie,achieved by using a POV shot from the hole in her head. The teenagers naturally decide to continue going in the same direction to search for help despite the fact that the girl had blown-ed her head just so that she couldn't go there. From then on you can guess what happens next.The characters are the same clichés you've seen in at least a hundred teen horror movies before. With the brave and moral heroine, her macho boyfriend, the cowardly smart guy, the slutty girl etc. etc. forming the bulk of the cast. Needless to say as is with most of the recent slashers movies go, none of these characters besides the heroine will survive.One reason why some horror movies succeed in creating a genial feel of terror is because the characters are sympathetic and nicely developed, I'm not saying they should be perfect angels but the viewer has to establish some connection to them so that when, lets say one of these characters dies you actually feel sad . Here chances are you'll just want to see them dead.Any attempts to create tension and fear in the viewer through the feeling of being chased by a remorseless chainsaw-armed killer are ruined by the filmmaker's lack of skill in creating more original and effective chase/hide-and-seek sequences. Instead we again see the same predictable situations copied from dozens of slasher movies before."The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" might appeal to a younger, unfamiliar with the genre person, but to the hardcore horror fan it would remain only as a painful memory of the ever popular remake trend.</fullReview>

It contains much suspense and It doesn't have a bad/boring moment in it.At the start at shows footage of bodies being taken away and found. It relates to the actual horror of the story. Then it shows to police officers investigating the Hewitt house. The setting of the film is very carefully planed out. In was set in a red neck scheme, with deformed lands as well as people. The Hippies are driving through this place and most of the setting is show en here. The Slaugter house kind of gives it away ! The Characters are prorated so well by the actors that I had to give this film an 9/10It has a really satisfying ending known that she escaped but What I don't get is at the end, they find someone but I don't really get it. I wish they had made it more clearer.This is a film that I would recommend to horror and gore fans. Best to watch it on a rainy night with the lights down low.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bought this film as I wanted a scare. The only scare I got was where the disk fell out of its case. I think that this film is not scary in any way.Firstly most of the killings occur in broad daylight and takes away the scare factor.Secondly the film states Based on a true story WRONG this film is not based on a madman, a massacre or a chainsaw, the director made the original film based on a grave robber called Ed Gein who stole body parts of the recently deceased and only killed 2 women over a three year period.The reason for this was to attach their genitalia above his own in a desperate bid to be a woman.Thirdly I think that the atmosphere set was poor, there was little/no music accompanying scary sequences.And Fourthly how can a saw built for chopping trees can cut through metal, body parts and clothing again and again and not become jammed.There were also to many unanswered questions such as who was the guy in the wheelchair and the why film does not keep consistent. One minute the chainsaw dude bludgeons someone to death with a mace and he is virtually immobile, another minute he is healthy enough to jump onto the top of a camper van silently with a chainsaw in hand without being noticed.I think this is a poor excuse for a horror movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the Texas Chainsaw Massacre with a group of friends, we were all stunned into horrified silence. I have never watched a movie that has silenced a group of ten loud teenage girls, the only occasional sounds being those of our screams.A lot of people didn't like this movie but I thought with the added 'real footage' and how it gave the audience the impression all of it really happened (it's based loosely from the story of Ed Gein) made this movie, if possible, even more terrifying. It had a great cast with notable performances by Jonathan Tucker (Morgan), R. Lee Ermy (Sheriff Hoyt)and Jessica Biel (Erin). It was wonderfully filmed and the music was particularly well done, adding to the fear and suspense.I thought this movie had most of the elements of a great horror film; suspense, thrills, gore and characters you can warm up to. I thought Jessica Biel did a superb job in this film, her fear was utterly convincing and I was glad to see she wasn't the typical horror-flick bimbo, running around screaming stupidly and not using her brain to avoid certain death. Despite this being a great remake of a classic horror flick, Jessica Biel's performance really was one of the highlights of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary, disturbing, but too full of itself.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Texas Chaisay Massacre didn't have a screenplay or storyline to die over, but was unequivocally one of the most nauseatingly scary and disturbing films I have ever seen. It was a ride that kept a knot in your stomach from the first whack on the head, to it's eventual conclusion. This time around the remake (of the movie they say is based on a true story but obviously over-hyped that dreadfully) comes with some of the scares and much more disgusting imagery of the original and all in all seems too intent to show the audience a creepy place without putting fourth anything much interesting.The movie starts out with documentary footage, followed by five teenagers on a road trip. So far so good. They pick up a strange girl walking by on the road, and from there on it's almost all down hill. That is until at least the last third of the movie that actually starts to resemble the dramatic tension of the original in some form. I'm not spoiling anything by saying teenagers are slaughtered one by one, and it involved a guy with a chainsaw named Letherface. What this is though is some of the most sadistic slaughtering in horror films that I've ever seen. All in all they're just slow death sequences in disgusting basements and sheds that just weren't pleasing or really that frightening. I'm not against gore or disturbing imagery in horror films, but TCM seems way too full of itself with how far they think they should go without concern from how they may turn people off.The movie takes you to a place that's not interesting, but seem intent to be totally disgusting and when you think they couldn't make you sick farther they go father. There's a profane sheriff who spits god knows what, meat in a shop with flies all over it, and teeth by a few rusty cars in a grassy field, and believe me that's only some of it. Not only does the movie not try at all to explain it's setting, it's not really trying to make it the least bit pleasing in any way. The people in it are constantly abused and tortured and there's very little room for any enjoyment. I'm not going to say you have to be a sadist to enjoy this film, but it certainly helps.The reason the film seems to salvage itself from being totally worthless is, oh, the last twenty minutes or so. Yeah it was still sadistic and disgusting, but at least it was closer in atmosphere to the original than it had been it's first hour plus. There are some well done sequences throughout, but all in all I can't recommend this film. It's more sadistic and disgusting than it is scary or captivating, and when you have that you probably don't have a very good slasher on your hands. There are certainly worse horror films (take the Grudge as a recent example) but there are certainly better ones as well like say the original TCM. Stay away from this one unless you're a big horror fan, which by the way in recent history I have certainly not been.4 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy remake of a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all the remakes of 1970's horror films today, one would expect to be disappointed. I was not expecting big things when I saw Marcus Nispel &amp; Michael Bay's remake of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' in Australia almost 2 years ago. However, I was quite impressed with what they did with it and their attempts to closely follow Tobe Hooper's original 1974 fright flick.There are a few twists to this story, which sets it apart from the original. The hitchhiker is a prime example; it's a young girl instead of a man, and she shows signs of being assaulted and subsequently shoots herself in the head, as opposed to Edwin Neal's psychotic hitcher who cuts himself deliberately &amp; is forced from the kids' van. Also, the characters are a little different - there's no Franklin (the boy in the wheelchair), and some of the inbred-cannibal family are different. Conspicuous by its absence is the dinner scene, where Leatherface &amp; his family tortured Marilyn Burns in the original.The sets are different &amp; more imposing; hardly surprising considering the 1974 classic was made on a razor-thin budget. The house could pass for a haunted house in any horror movie or kids' story; it looks creepy both outside and in, with parts of it kept immaculately (the living room &amp; front hall) but with others in absolute decay (the kitchen &amp; basement). The Old Crawford Mill - apparently an abandoned cotton mill - also portrays a creepy-looking atmosphere where you might expect to encounter Leatherface.The characters are a little more interesting than the 1974 version; namely Erin (Jessica Biel), who gives a terrific performance as the heroine &amp; sole survivor of the encounter with Leatherface &amp; the cannibalistic family. At times she's not unlike Sigourney Weaver's portrayal of Warrant Officer Ripley in 'Aliens', a role that was nicknamed 'Ms. Rambo'. The other kids are entirely believable, especially Morgan (Jonathan Tucker) and Kemper (Eric Balfour), who play the nerdy, pot-smoking intellectual and the leader-type respectively. R. Lee Ermey (best known as the foul-mouthed, unpleasant Gunnery Sgt. Hartman from Full Metal Jacket) is particularly effective as the sheriff who is also part of the cannibalistic family. It's not hard to see him repeating some of the drill-instructor persona in this film, especially when he tortures Morgan at the van &amp; house. Old Monty - who I assume is Leatherface's father - gives a good appearance as the 'disgusting, creepy old man', which is noticeable when he starts trying to grope Erin as she tries to help him off the floor. Leatherface himself is somewhat different than in the original; his mask has an identity all its own, and he's largely silent - unlike the one in the original who squealed when excited. He is more like the silent, sinister killer of 'Halloween' - the only sound he makes is that of his chainsaw.One of the more sinister parts of the movie is the score, by relatively unknown Steve Jablonsky. The low brass, low strings &amp; bassoon theme prevalent through most of the first half of the film hints at trouble to come wherever it appears. Some of the better scored sequences are the chase scenes - a quick-paced motif featuring French horns, trumpets &amp; strings as the characters run from Leatherface &amp; his loudly-buzzing chainsaw.This is one of the better horror-movie remakes. It's in a class all its own and should really be considered as separate &amp; distinct from Tobe Hooper's 1974 classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay remake, but it's nowhere near as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of the 1974 classic has a few good elements but ultimately, it falls short.The acting could (emphasis on that) be considered better and the quality is obviously a lot better. The family is just as crazy and Leatherface is portrayed well.The plot (for those who haven't seen the original) is about five teens going to a concert. They pick up a hitchhiker on the way, she is deeply disturbed about something. She proceeds to blow her brains away. The teens go to the nearby town to get help, too bad for them that the townspeople are crazy. Enter the slaughtering.The original was something new, it disturbed and scared many people. Moreover, it didn't need a bucket load of blood, which this one has. It almost turned into a typical teenage horror/slasher, which the original was not, what saved it was some dark and disturbing scenes and Jessica Biel was good as the heroine Erin. However it felt to modern and it didn't add anything new or necessary.This movie could have done with the chainsaw dance at the end or the supper scene to make it better aside from all this I would say it's definitely one of the more faithful, better remakes, but it will never top the original.2?/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A completely worthless remake of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. TCM '03 is basically a retelling of the '74 version of TCM. The story is slightly modified, but not in any appreciable way. The cast is utterly forgettable, with the exception of R. Lee Ermey (who turns in a typical adaptation of his "Gunnery Sergeant Hartman" character from "Full Metal Jacket") and Jessica Biel (who looked too hot in a wet T-shirt to forget). Everything that made the original shocking is reproduced here, but it's not so very shocking in light of the original, or in the context of 30 years of slasher films that have been produced in the interim. It fails to be as shocking as other TCM derivative films (like House of 1000 Corpses... another movie to avoid). Unfortunately it made many times over it's original budget in gross profit, meaning the public will be subjected to at least 1 sequel.If you want to watch a TCM movie, go for the '74 original... or one of the hilariously bad sequels like TCM 4 - "The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre", featuring Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of guys would say this movie was pretty good because it starred Jessica Biel's tank top. I say it was pretty good because Leatherface had the gall to wear Jessica's boyfriend's face while he tried to kill her. Dude. The whole 'motivation' behind Leatherface's actions was kind of silly...I mean, it sucks he'd never get a girl with that mug, but for goodness sake don't try to tell me WHY he's buzzing people. He's CRAZY. that's enough of an explanation for me. I mean, Freddy did bad things to kids because he's a pervert, you don't have to tell me it was because women hated the fact he didn't have a chin. Anyway, R. Lee Ermey is the coolest guy I wouldn't want for a grampa. 7 OUT OF 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant horror film which is unfairly criticized for being a 'remake'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly I would like to say that I am a massive fan of the original. The film managed to scare me without the use of excessive gore and I like that in a horror film. It's not all about what you see, more of what your mind can imagine. Saying that though, gore can play a big part in scaring the hell out of me as was evident here. I think the thing people should realise when watching this so called remake is that it isn't trying to copy the original exactly. It's instead offering a new, somewhat modern spin on the old story. I don't think any of the fans of the original would have liked it if the film was simply remade, scene by scene as was done in the completely unnecessary remake of psycho. That would have been pointless and would not have served any purpose. I think what the film is trying to do is to bring the basic story of the original and expanding it which will give fans of the original a more in-depth insight and will also bring in new fans who haven't seen the original.The film's genre is extreme horror and it succeeded in horrifying me extremely! I think I am so used to seeing gore and extreme violence in films today that it no longer usually has the ability to shock me anymore. This film was different though. SPOILER ALERT. The part where the gorgeous young blond man (played brilliantly by Mike Vogel) was captured and subsequently had his leg chainsawed off scared the hell out of me and still haunts me even now. What scared me though wasn't necessarily seeing his leg being cut off, it was the thought of his intense fear at being left to die in the most slow and painful way possible. This was the disturbing aspect. When Leatherface was dragging him down to his little 'workshop'and he was so desperate to get away (despite being one limb short) he tried to cling onto the wall by his fingernails, so they all broke off, that disturbed and upset me greatly. That's where the real horror comes from, the thought of a situation being so desperate that there is no way on earth you can get out of it. You just have to accept the inevitable.I thought the characters were all good (except for pepper. She annoyed me a bit, not sure why!) Jessica Biel was a very good heroine and really delivered the goods. My only gripe with this film was the fact that they tried to explain away Leatherface's madness, although it didn't bother me that much. I can see what the filmmakers were trying to do in giving him some depth, I just don't think it was really needed.All in all, a great film for fans of horror. If it hadn't have been tagged with being a remake, and indeed if the original never even existed, i think it would have been received much better.</fullReview>

It has absolutely no let up in its nastiness or intensity, it's quite gory and grimy for a mainstream update and EVERY set piece is memorable.The best recommendation I can give this film is: It blows the classic original out of the water, cannot wait for a sequel to this.... Horror fans who have put this off due to negative reviews or respect for the original, I implore you to give this a chance.

		<fullReview>It's hard to out do an original..and the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre is of course classic..but this one...far exceeds how I feel about the first one. Up to date with all the right actors, It's even scarier than the first..way scarier! I don't understand why so many people said this film had tons of gore and blood, because it did'nt..no more than any other horror film, it hints at situations..without showing you, and leaves you knowing what's going on without actually seeing it, and that makes it really eerie. Jessica Biel done a WONDERFUL job playing the lead role, when she screams..you want to scream. I was hesitant to see it at first because so many people bashed it for being gory, and when I saw it..I was SO glad I did, it's on my top 5 horror film list along with 'Pet Semetary', 'Evil Dead', '28 days later' and 'The Ring', so if you like those, will you DEFINITELY love this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a remake worth watching!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to tell you this is the best movie I've ever seen or even among the top 100 but I really enjoyed it and have watched it twice so far, and will watch it again. I was pleasantly pleased and am now going to re-watch the original. I'm not a big fan of gore, I like horror. Though there were some gory scenes, I was fine with it. I was glad they didn't go for blood shooting everywhere all the time and show people being skinned in graphic detail. They kept that to a minimum, considering that those things were taking place. I felt that Jessica Biel did a terrific job and her character was believable. She freaked out a few times, who wouldn't when being chased by a guy wearing your boyfriends face and wielding a chain-saw, but she never completely lost it. She did what she had to do and she survived. Good job! The short documentary at the beginning and end of the film, it was apparently cut from some versions, was very misleading. It made it seem that the story was true and that the events really happened. Sad news to those who believe that. Though based on a real person, Ed Gein, the story itself is fiction. Ed Gein didn't kill people with a chainsaw, he didn't even live in Texas. He was insane, however, and the things he did in real life were just as bad (and, yes, he wore skin-masks made from his victims as well as other parts as well.) The two disc set contains a documentary on Ed Gein but I haven't watched it yet. I just purchased the two disc set today and look forward to the documentary as a bedtime story. Sweet dreams! I do recommend this film to horror fans and have added it to my horror collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kill me, I loved the TCM remake! I love the original but I have to say the new one is definitely on par. The acting, the directing, and the new Leatherface is scary as hell. I wouldn't say it's the best remake ever although it's up there. I love how they utilized a lot of the same things like John Laroquette doing the intro and the sound of the old time camera. Now days it seems to be the "it" thing to remake horror movies with the upcoming Amittyville Horror, Pet Semetary, House of Wax, etc... Any thoughts on the best remakes so far? I'd have to give it to Dawn of the Dead 2004 or Night of the Living Dead 1990, it's close. Along with Carpenter's The Thing, House on Haunted Hill, and The Ring. Or the worst remakes like The Haunting or Toolbox Murders (not bad but don't exceed the originals), what do you think?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>so much better than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Texas chainsaw massacre 2003 is so much better than the original its not even something to laugh about. this remake has great acting, suspense, thrills, blood/gore, and plays everything out smarter than the first film. i did not like the original or the fact that a girl spends the last 20 minutes of the film doing nothing but screaming her fool head off. i had to mute it i got so irritated. i really do not see how any parts of the film could've shocked audiences when it was released in the early-mid seventies. the premise of the film is a loose prequel to films like silence of the lambs or the television series the x files. a group of teenagers are headed to a concert in their Volkswagon van. they are passing through a small town in Texas when they come across a young man with blood on his face,hands, and clothing. the rest goes from there in discovering a run down home where a very strange disabled man lives with his family. leather face is the head killer as they soon find out and one by one the kids are murdered and sliced up for dinner. one girl remains and all she is capable of is screaming like an idiot for the last 20 minutes of the film. everything about the remake is steps above the original in acting, directing, cinematography, and storytelling. rent the Texas chainsaw massacre 2003 on DVD and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't mess with titles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't really like remakes: I usually prefer movies that steps from others but have something of their own. The title, for instance. NID DE GUEPES, for example, has a great debt to ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 but is not an official remake. Now the new trend in Hollywood is doing remakes of genre movies which have in common with the original only the title - a very important thing for feature, since it's their name. Changing the storyline and the concepts can be quiet dangerous, let's take this movie for example: it's very well directed and photographed, it's stylish, has blood, good looking girls and dolby sound...BUT IS NOT THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE. They removed one of the basilar elements of the original: the cannibalism, which is the engine of the story. Leatherface was scary since, for him, there was no difference between a girl and a cow: everything was food for him, life an object. He was like a machine: the only thing he could do was killing without caring. Now that's really scary. In the remake, instead, there's no cannibalism (so no motivation behind what the entire family - since the masked guy was just one of leads - behaviour) and Leatherface has been transformed in the latest Jason-like bogeyman. Oh yes, they added a quiet a lot of splatter (exploding heads, mutilated limbs and so on) but is all weak compared to the dinner sequence of the original (as you know the origin of the meat they're eating). Now don't misunderstood me: I liked the remake and I'm very happy with my special edition DVD of it, but comparing it to the original is an insult.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Not-So-Worthy Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a scary, disgusting, disturbing film. You know the kind - like you need to shower after having seen it. Despite its minimal bloodletting on screen, its perverse nature of what it doesn't show is incredibly strong. Having said that, I was more than a little surprised that a remake was being made. I didn't think there was any way - especially in our politically correct world - to upstage the original, and if that could not be done than why bother? Well, I was right. This movie is decently made, has some genuine scares, creates some well-shot, effective scenes like the one in the meat butchering plant, and yet falls terribly short of creating even half of the fear, loathing, disgust, and awe of its predecessor. I found it to be very tame in fact when compared with Hooper's film. There are some gory scenes. There is more blood in this one easily. But blood alone and guts alone are not enough to shock. The original film shocked because of its timing. It came out in the 70's when a film like that could come out and be successful. It had a premise that had never been done before. This is old hat here. As a film you could certainly do worse in investing your time. But why see this when you can see the one that started it all? The original TCM is a classic horror film. It was masterfully directed, bone-chillingly scary, and left images in your mind weeks after having seen it. Its likes have never really been seen since - Thank God! I like to see it every two years or so to remind me how powerful film can be and what kind of decade the 70's was. This film is not close on any of those counts. The actors are decent, political correctness wins(no handicapped Franklin here), the teens are possible dope fiends(possibly allowing for a moral right to snuff out their flames), and script creativity is not overwhelming. If you want to see a good, very surprising remake, see Dawn of the Dead. That film's original had multi-purposes which allowed the present-day film maker to experiment more. In this TCM, its basically the same story with the same ending. A few changes here and there but nothing earth shattering by any means.</fullReview>

But if you pick up a girl that is incoherent saying that she wants to go home and there is a really bad man, or that "they're all dead" I would not go in the direction that she says when "you're going the wrong way." I think that they should have at least known that when the lady at the gas station said "what you do is your own business" is a sign that there is something really freaked out with that town and that they should get the f#@$ out of there and just take the body to another town.

		<fullReview>Slick but pointless remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre isn't the complete disaster I expected--the movie is extremely well-shot, R Lee Ermey is hilarious and Jessica Biel certainly is attractive running around in shorts and a skin-tight T. Unfortunately there isn't much suspense and the characters are generally so stupid and unlikable that it's hard to have any rooting interest in what's happening. I would have to say the low point in terms of character sympathy comes when the "teens" give R Lee the gun a female hitchhiker had used to blow her brains out in their van and he put the gun in his empty ankle holster. I don't know about you but that would have been a clear sign to me that something was wrong and I would have gotten out of there as quickly as humanly possible. But the characters in the movie don't make any connection between the police officer and their suicidal passenger until much later. Characters that stupid are just impossible to care about. The demented family gathering around the dinner table trying to get the old man to off Marilyn Burns with a slaughterhouse hammer is still one of the most intensely creepy and uncomfortably funny sequences I have ever seen in a horror movie. The original Texas Chainsaw can make you squirm even though, contrary to its reputation from people who never actually watched the movie, it has no graphic violence or gore. (Remake producer Michael Bay displayed his ignorance by claiming in interviews that his new version would have none of the graphic gore of the original). I think the most shocking thing about the remake is the fact that so many people on this site actually think it's a great film. People are entitled to their opinions but this movie is so far from great I can't help but wonder if some of these reviews are from the kinds of people who wouldn't find it strange when a police officer puts a murder weapon in his own empty holster. </fullReview>

As they are passing through Travis County, they unsuspectedly almost hit a troubled teen (Lauren German). The teens decide to give her a ride home or wherever she needs to go. The girl won't stop saying that they are "going the wrong way". The hitchhiker takes a gun from in between her legs and shoots herself in the head because she can't take it anymore. The teens try to find the sheriff (R. Lee Ermey) so they can get the body out of their van and back to her family where she belongs. As they are trying to find the sheriff, they stop at the Old Crawford Mill to find him. Soon they find out it was all a trick from these sick, inbred people in the town and a cannabalic man called Leatherface (Andrew Bryniarski) is hunting every one of these teens down. They need to get out of this town as fast as they can if they ever want to see the next day. Main Characters: Jessica Biel, Jonothan Tucker, Erica Leehrsen, Andrew Bryniarski, R. Lee ErmeyThis has to be one of the best movies I have ever seen!! It was creative, scary, and didn't bore me at all! I would definitely recommend this movie to ANYONE.

		<fullReview>''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' remake takes the slasher genre to another level. It just proves that not all those types of movies are about mindless psychotic killers running around killing people with no motivation what so ever (minus killing people), something many ''slasher'' movies are known for. However, this movie is basically a Hollywood ''slasher'' film. One that I happen to enjoy a lot. The beauty of the movie is that is it certainly, at least in my eyes, comes close to the original. Now, before anyone starts to complain that it sucks or I'm nuts to think about something like that, take note that this movie is at least better then the pathetic fourth sequel ''The Next Generation''. Sure, it may not have that original feel like the first one did, but still, this movie is a little bit darker and more serious (I personally believe the original was sort of a dark comedy). I do admit, however, that the characters did stupid things in the movie, while in the original, it just took you by surprise to what happened to them. Still, I give the character Erin credit for not running screaming around while being chased (even though this was Sally's bad habit in the first film).Leatherface was portrayed good, but, I think we saw way too much of him. It kind of lowers the suspense your expecting. Plus, the film suffers to what previous ones did, too many family members with little interaction with each other. Why it couldn't have been like just Leatherface and the two brothers is beyond me. Still, it ain't enough to take down the film. Overall, I think this is a excellent movie, and I believe it's up there with the original film as well.If your looking for a horror film that's funny, but still dark, watch the original version, if your looking for a more serious and darker version, watch the new movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is a single blemish. I watched it, fast-forwarded it, and regretted having wasted my time on this dilettantish piece of work. I have never heard of the director before, and probably never will again. It's just amazing that seemingly everyone gets to direct a movie. None of the characters is likeable. In fact, I wanted them to be slaughtered. The dialogue is rudimentary and annoying and becomes practically nonexistent in the second half of the movie when the constant screams and chases take over. Even the gore that is indicated in the title is left to be desired. Pulp Fiction had more violence in it.The film fails to create a dark atmosphere, if it ever intended to do that. It just drags on from scene to scene without consistency. The 'Inspired By A True Story' tag only shows how low the filmmakers needed to get to increase attraction. Such a thing never happened.Admittedly, Jessica Biel is smoking hot in this flick, but she kept distracting me with her tight outfit even when she was screaming for her life. In a scene you get to see her nipples through a wet shirt. Now if that's not ingenious filmmaking...It was so unnecessary to do this remake...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main problem with this movie was that, obviously, people were going to compare it with the original. Well, it is a remake. The thing is, such comparisons are redundant, as what we have here is a great example of modern horror film-making. We all know the original movie - the first time we saw it, the infamous, banned Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE, oh didn't we feel naughty? - but let's be honest, the film itself was a bit of a let down. There was no blood, no sex, no full-on cannibalism. Just a suggestion of violence and a style of filming to give it a documentary feel. What this remake does is take the title of the original (still one of the greatest film titles of all time) and actually fit it to a movie that plays out what the title suggests. The plot is simple: five kids end up in a remote Texas town and get stalked by a psychopath called Leatherface. You don't need to know any more than that. While this film doesn't have the snuff feel of the original, it doesn't, thank goodness, have a glitzy, polished Hollywood production. Basically, this film is a nasty bastard, and exactly what horror films need now we seem to have gotten over the dreadful Scream-style teen flicks. Just watch it...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, first and foremost let me say that i'm all for remakes. It's nice to see a director put a new spin on an old story. Some remakes are enjoyable and possibly even better than the original - Ocean's 11 and The Ring are the first that comes to mind. But unfortunately, most remakes fall short and end up being a miserable viewing experience i.e. Rear Window, Psycho. And now we can add Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Sorry but this flick just didn't scare me. It was stupid, pointless. Bad acting, bad script, bad directing, bad camera work...everything. Not even halfway through this flick i had to stop myself from shutting it off. It was horrendous. I've read other comments about how this movie was sooo scary, pssh. If i had been one of those kids in the van, i would have dropped off that body and kept on moving, forget waiting around. I do admit that it was cool to see Leatherface sewing together masks and running after people with his chainsaw. That was actually scary. But those moments were few and far between. I kept thinking "this would actually happen, that guy wouldn't still be alive" - in reference to the guy who got his leg chopped off at a major artery and was still concious after 5 hours. And what was with the camera always being on Jessica Biel's chest? (And why did i feel like i was watching her character Mary Camden from 7th Heaven?) So, if you're looking for a good scare, rent the original. This one just plain sucked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Evil Film (And I Mean That In A Good Way)!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a HUGE fan of the original Texas Chainsaw, and other hard-core, mean-spirited horror films (mainly from the 1970's) such as Hills Have Eyes and Eaten Alive (also by Tobe Hooper) and I must say: This remake is the real thing. A real Horror Film, without jokes, without cutesy one-liners by the killer(s), without stupid teenagers. This one uses psychology over shock value; This family is one angry bunch! The young people, their victims, project real fright. One scene struck me as very realistic: When the Sheriff makes them lie down in the dirt, and one of the girls is crying, "We're all gonna die". Very "Last House On The Left". Also, the cinematography is phenomenal. The tracking shots, in particular the chase through the bedsheets, are second to none. The whole atmosphere, the dark sets, the old photographs on the walls, the record player, the use of local actors (remind me never to drive through the middle of Texas!), make this film a very pleasant surprise. It joins the ranks of the all-timers, before Horror was watered down for a new, over-protected generation. Thanks to everyone involved for making a truly evil film.</fullReview>

I stayed on the edge of my seat the whole movie.I enjoyed that they opened and closed the movie with real scene footage. The person who added a little comedy in the movie was the Sheriff.He just seemed so much like the way a sheriff from a small county would act. The only thing I didn't understand was the part about the baby.Overall I give this movie a 10 because it was so suspenseful throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good horror flick for teens..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cast: Jessica Biel, R. Lee Ermey, Eric Balfour, Andrew BryniarskiRating: R:::SPOILER WARNING:::This 'remake' of the 1974 classic is anything but a remake. I found this film to be much better then the original because it had something that the first didn't: Gore. All horror flicks nowadays need to be packed with violence and this movie doesn't fall short.The way this movie was made was very interesting too. It started and ended in black and white like it was a documentary. It starts by showing police officers in Travis County, Texas examining the Hewitt resident's. Anyone who has no background on this film immediately believes that what was about to be seen was all a true story.Thomas Hewitt, or 'Leatherface,' had a rare skin disease as a boy and it caused the skin on this face to literally 'fall off.' When he killed his victims, he'd slice off their face and sew it so that he could wear it. His family were a bunch of whackos too; as were the other few people who lived in Travis County.Five teenage friends were driving through a deserted part of Texas on their way to Dallas to see a Skynard concert. On their way, they picked up a hitchhiker who had already been through what these five teenagers were about to go through. She shot herself when she realized that the teenagers were heading back towards the Hewitt's gas station.What happens to these five teenagers? Well, you'll need to watch the film to find that out. The story ends in its' documentary form. The Travis County officers are now inside the Hewitt house when something odd happens. It seems that the crime scene wasn't secure... -Pat7.5/10NOTE: The police footage at the beginning and end of the movie leads you to believe this is all a true story. It's BASED on a true story, BUT there never really was a "Texas Chainsaw Massacre."</fullReview>

But I built up the nerve to stay and fight it out. I'm glad I did. As a matter of fact I went back to see this film three more times. It's very hard to compare this remake with the original. A lot has changed in 30 years since the original. I won't give anything away. And I highly recommend this film. The Special Edition DVD is excellent and worth every bloody penny. On a scale of 1 to 5 stars...this baby gets a 5. We need more horror films like this one. One that grabs you by the throat, and then punches you in the face. It doesn't let go until the very end. And even then you walk out of the theater with it still in your head. AWESOME!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't really expecting much when I rented TCM last week, but was left quite impressed when the credits began to role. The acting leaves a little to be desired, but what I found pleasing more than made up for it. My hat goes off to the screenwriter(s) involved in this film. Filmed in a stylish yet not too flamboyant style, some of the the realism is lost, but is made up for with an intensity that was lacking in it's predecessor. While only paying loose homage to the original, this modern vision does not stoop for the cheap thrills that most films of the horror genre in modern history crutch themselves on- namely stupid one liners and completely unbelievable character interactions. What you see happening on the screen, in all its twisted fascination, effects the characters how you would expect it to- dizzying fear and a complete loss of self control. We witness first hand the complete loss of hope in the victims as they are brought to tears in realization of their impending fate. That is a rare thing in horror films these days.</fullReview>

They all did very well. Its graphic voilence and gore scared me so much, I could barely handle the movie after a while, even though I did watch the whole thing and loved it. The entire setting, plot, Leatherface and the sound of the chainsaw wraps itself around you and doesn't let go until...a few days later. This film messes with your mind as well as scaring you with blood and guts. If you're into being scared until you can't breathe, this is for you! You'll scream until you can't scream any more! **** out of **** stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS IN THIS COMMENT!!!! This may have been a violent, freaky and gory film, but to me it was awesome. The acting is the best I have ever seen and each character was carefully written. The best parts were the beginning when they were driving down the road smoking it up, that was hilarious and when Erin threw the roach out the window. And I loved the end when Erin decided to take the baby from them. I think what happened was the people in that picture where there, and they were killed, and the psychos took the baby, because if you look closely on the left side of the picture, you see the girl that the group pick up in the beginning. But I totally recommend this movie to horror-movie lovers...but this movie is not, I repeat not, for the faint of heart.</fullReview>

Yes, the movie is very gory, but is it not supposed to be? There are certain things that differ from the original, but I fell that the story holds up very well. I jumped a few times during this film. The acting is obviously done a lot better than the first. The DTS sound on the DVD is great as well. If you plan on owning it on DVD, it also has a ton of extras. This was one of the first "horror" movies I have seen in a long time that actually was not cheesy. I would recommend it if you are a fan of the original, or just like scary movies. If you are easily grossed out, this film is NOT for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who read my review of the new Dawn Of The Dead knows I won't accept some pitiful re-use of a classic title to peddle their film on an unsuspecting mass of 70's horror fans, so I will simply say this: The TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE redux is a masterpiece in every sense. The essence of the original is fully realized, the characters are believable and some new elements are added that do not take away from the original, yet they truly re-invent this classic with the same level of scares and atmosphere that shocked me in 1974!This is an authentic vision right down to the demented family values. No MTV style editing here, the violence is IN YOUR FACE and the cinematography by (original lenser) Dan Pearl completely captures the dusty deserted Texas roads of the original. A brilliant script and adept direction bring a nearly 30 year old classic full circle to scare the hell out of you and create the same sense of foreboding as Tobe Hooper and Kim Henkel's film did. A bonus feature is the opening narration by John Larroquette. This movie does the 70's proud!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen both the original, and this remake. I'm not one for old movies, but the first was suprisingly startling. When you look at films like the original Friday the 13th, you tend to ask yourself "how did people back then truly get freaked out by this stuff." Not so with TCM. Overall, I found both films to be enjoyable, but this one was the ultimate horror film in my opinion, complete with all the "why doesn't he just do this instead of that" cliches I've come to expect from a scary movie. The best aspect for me was the evil vibe surrounding the entire town. Good setup too, you knew that these kids were on their own when the police/help factor was taken away. The town was like another world in itself. It's a true blue horror flick... so it's going to have it's shortcomings anyway you look at it. Personally, I can't think of a better movie in this catagory. Watch it with the lights off, it adds to the setting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*******SPOILERS*******The texas chainsaw massacre story starts off with five youths travelling through texas to a concert. but when they pick up a paranoid young girl, who soon commits suicide then the nightmare begins. Personally i did have expectations for this film considering i had seen all the texas chainsaw massacre's. But to be honest i did think this film could be better i love gore in movie e.g dawn of the dead and more but in this film apart from the sledgehammer scene and the meat hook scene the film is easily viewable for a 5 year old. For example when pepper is killed with the chainsaw you cant see the chainsaw go through her i know of course it will be hard for a director in a film to do that but that would increase the vote i give this film. Anyway i think the screenplay is brilliant much better then TCM 1974 and the acting is fantastic, I think this could be a turning point in the career of Jessica Biel, Eric Balfour and Mike Vogel. i think if they put more horror in some scenes may be the icing on the cake some scenes with leatherface were'nt really scary. Mind you Andrew Bryniarski was great as Leatherface. There are very many Graphic Scenes like Andy's death Kempers death the meat hook and the sewing of Kemper's face. Overall The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2003, a very entertaining, scary,gory film a must see for all horror fans and Texas Chainsaw Massacre fans 4.5 stars out of 5 Joe</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THIS FILM IS SCARY! REAL HORROR! A GREAT RE-MAKE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "Texas chainsaw masscare" was, and still is one of the scariest films ever made. The title alone is still infamous for horror. The re-make? Possibly one of the scariest horror re-makes ever! Unflinching in gore, suspense and terror, just imagining living through an ordeal like this would give you nightmares for months. The storyline is slightly tweaked to give things a new twist. And the gore is more heavy. But the basic horrific premise is the same: a "family" of killers on the rampage! The acting is much better in this one, but I won't take away anything from the original as it is equally freaky! This re-make was filmed for a meager $10 million and suprised the industry by grossing(literally) over $70 million at the U.S. box office alone. The ending is much better and very chilling. All I can say is, do not watch this alone if you are easily freaked out! And be prepared for relentless terror, gore and no sympothy to any of the ill fated victims. And if you think something like this could never happen, just remember the horrible Sharon Tate murders masterminded by the sick Charles Manson in 1969. Although those murders differed, they are equally as gruesome and uncalled for. This film delivers horror in the true sence of the word and reminds us that sick demented killers do exist in our society. As twisted and gross as this film is, it also does was it simply intended to do: scare the living daylights out of you! If you want extreme horror, this is it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the original as it is the only film that scares me the most. I am the type of person who gets scared by watching movies but the original Texas Massacre wasn't scary because of people jumping out of nowhere it was scary because of the amount of screaming that was involved. The screams of the young girl in the movie don't leave you for a long time after watching it so I was wondering what can kind of horror they were going to take on the newer version. It does start off well and I think there isn't a scene throughout the whole movie where I got bored, but at the same time it offered nothing new compared to what the original did. I didn't like the fact we saw Leather face's real face because the horror of his character is thinking what lies behind the mask so I didn't like that. But there is a lot of tension and not to many jump out of your seat scenes which is quite good as you'd think that's how they would take this. The cinematography was outstanding and not expected. I wasn't convinced by the year it was set for one bit, but that doesn't make this a bad film. The director who ever he or she was has put a lot of thought into this to try and make up his own version of Texas Massacre and succeeded making this nearly as good as the original. I would tell any self respecting horror junkie to buy or watch this just for the concept and the way it was filmed because you'd be surprised of how good this film really is. Bravo!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally an intense horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, I finally saw this tonight, and was really impressed with it's scare tactics. It's rare that I'll get so into a horror movie, and find that I'm being scared by it. Most of the time, I'm yawning through it, but more often than not, I just like watching these horrors for the stories, because generally, they have good plots. This one however, takes the cake, with regards to being intense. I must admit, I have never seen the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but if it's anything like this one, than it's definitely good.Now I know where Rob Zombie got (stole) most of his ideas from for his piece (of crap), House of 1,000 Corpses. There were some scenes, I will admit, I had to look away at...I don't care for the skin being removed from people's faces, or the fact that they get hung (still alive mind you) to a hook and watching their legs being sawed off. But, I did however, enjoy the (hide and seek if you will) chase scenes, especially towards the end. I never, ever, ever get scared from these movies, and my heart was pounding so hard! I kept routing for the star...Jessica Biel every time she got away, or when she was stuck somewhere. I was just so into the film. I felt like I was there. And it is also rare, that a movie will surprise me when it comes to someone popping up behind the corner. There was one scene in the middle when the two girls are trying to start their car...well, I won't give it away, but I freaked out. And actually gasped aloud.Now, let's get to the real review of the film. The technical stuff. As I said before, I have not yet seen the original film, so I have no idea how true this script stuck to the first, or if it was completely different, with just the same idea and title. However, if it is like the first movie, than they did a terrific job writing the first and second time. Or just this time around. I was impressed with most of the make-up and costumes (with the exception of Biel's boyfriend's clothes. His wardrobe looked like something from present day, which wasn't good since it took place in 1973), and the sets were really well thought out, with all of the extra little additions they made here and there, including, rust, rats, rain drops, dust, etc.The acting: Everyone did an outstanding and believable job. There is one person though who I despise as an actor. He is probably my least favorite actor in all of Hollywood. His name is, R. Lee Ermey. I have no idea what the guy is like in real life, so I won't say that I dislike him as a person, just as an actor. There's something about the guy that bothers me, and maybe that was a good thing for the character that he played in this movie. But, that's how I feel about him in every single role I've ever seen him. Granted, most of the stuff I've seen him in, he has played the bad guy, but even in Saving Silverman, he just annoyed the heck out of me. Why anyone ever thought this guy would be good in the movies, is beyond me. But, with that said, everyone else in the movie, really captured their characters extremely well. Sometimes I had to remind myself (okay, he's just an actor. It's not really happening to him. He's just pretending...). But, if you do that, sometimes it can ruin the movie.The directing was really well done, and the casting directors made really good choices as far as the five teens that have the day from hell. But, if you're not really into scary movies (movies, that really, truly scare you ), than this probably isn't going to be the best choice for you. And, if you're a fan of Jessica Biel's don't be surprised if her demeanor is a tad askew from that of her character's on 7th Heaven. It's quite a different role, and genre.10 being the highest, overall I give the film an 8. I didn't think that it was necessary to show a lot of the graphic, disturbing stuff that "Leatherface" did to his victims, down below, but overall it was a really enjoyable film, and I give it the score I do.And that's my review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen the original TCM as one of my first experiences in when things go horribly wrong on DVD-Video, I approached this new version with a sense of hope that investing a little money could at least result in a cleaner-looking film. Well, the film looks and sounds more professional and solid than the 1974 original, but that is about it. The story is a mess, and most of the acting is not any better.Indeed, where the original managed to completely creep the viewer out by leaving things to the imagination, this 2003 remake leaves nothing to the imagination, and it suffers terribly as a direct result. Given that the 1974 original was one of the many films that Blair Witch Trash wishes it was, I was expecting a lot better here.The original TCM's Leatherface was a monster the likes of which we'd never seen before. In a direct contrast to the gloating of Freddy or the explanations by proxy of Jason, the reason why Leatherface as portrayed by Gunnar Hansen still terrifies audiences is because no explanation or reason is provided for his actions. He is just doing these terrible things. Another area where the 1974 Leatherface has it all over the 2003 Leatherface is that the 1974 version was a mixture of quirky, socially-inept movements and inexplicable actions. When he hits one victim over the head with a hammer, the sound of squealing pigs can be heard, emphasising the emotional weight that Leatherface feels towards his victims. To him, meat is just meat. To cap it all off, the Swedish actor playing him stood on platforms to make him appear even taller than the victims, which is saying something given that he was already 6'4".2003's Leatherface has no emotional impact on the viewer. Sure, the imposing silence is mostly still there, but the awkward movements, the eccentricity, and the emotional weight is just gone. In an attempt to bring the last of these things back, the screenwriters put in a ridiculous scene in which we're told about how this little boy with a bad skin condition became this monster. Needless to say, it doesn't work. The concept of less being more applies doubly to our understanding of Leatherface's motivations. The less we are told, the more we imagine, and that is what makes this 2003 remake such a poke in the eye to fans of the original.One of the most popular comments about the original is amazement at how restrained it seems to be. You don't actually see much gore, as such. Instead, you are shown enough to understand what is happening, and the rest is left for you to imagine. Tobe Hooper was well aware of the fact that what the human mind can create for itself was far more terrifying than what could be captured by a lens, and he exploited this to the fullest opportunity. This is where the remake suffers badly. Instead of being shown enough for the mind to pick up the thread of what is going on, the remake showers the viewer in so much gore that the imagination literally has nothing to do. This pulls the viewer right out of the film and reminds them that they are sitting in a theatre. By contrast, the original forced the viewer to imagine most of what was done to the victims, and that was far more effective simply because those things would also often star the viewer.In the end, even a great performance by R. Lee Ermey cannot save a badly structured story and an inability to recognise that less is more. All the severed legs and gaping bullet wounds in the world cannot make up for leaving the viewer's thought processes nothing to do. All in all, this film gets a three out of ten from me. It would have gotten more, but the omission of any chainsaw-dancing sequence only adds insult to injury.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Practically Perfect Horror Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit that I haven't seen Tobe Hooper's 1974 TCM (it's still on the Black List in Germany), and I didn't know too much about it, so Marcus Nispel's version was an entirely new movie for me. (Okay, I saw a movie with Renée Zellweger from the 1990s, but don't get me started on that one.)The movie scared the hell out of me! I sat there on my seat as if I were trapped in hell for an hour and a half. Nispel's TCM is extremely well made; the atmosphere, setting, art direction, music, editing, and photography re-presents film art at its finest here. And even the acting was good (which is not very often the case in this kind of movies, you must admit); Jessica Biel gave an extraordinarily intriguing performance, and so did the handsome Mike Vogel (can't wait to see him in another movie, he's incredibly hot!), not to mention Jonathan Tucker from "The Deep End" and "The Virgin Suicides".All in all, I gave this movie 8 out of 10 and can highly recommend it. A beautifully made horror shocker!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So much about this movie doesn't make sense, I'm not really sure where to begin. I would never suggest that the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre was perfect by any means, and I suppose that's precisely why I thought a remake might not be such a bad thing. Even the trailer had me just a little excited.The movie I saw in the theatre, however, was utterly miserable. It was just a big mash of cliches, stereotypes, manipulative drama and annoying characters. Fans of the original should especially be warned that this is not so much a remake, as a completely different (and much worse) movie that also happens to include a masked guy wielding a chainsaw. A huge portion of the most memorable scenes, and characters for that matter, have been cut.The family of Texas weirdos has been reduced to a handful of characters who happen to live in a house together but never really communicate in any meaningful way. I'm not even sure why some of them are there, since they don't do anything all that noteworthy. Leatherface is also given a "touchingly" human side when it is revealed why he wears his masks. Bless that poor boy for ridding the world of those nasty, pot-smoking, sexually-promiscuous teens.The heroes of the movie are an unlikable bunch, and are mostly too dumb or annoying to be realistic or sympathetic. That is, except for the saintly character played by Jessica Biel. Want to guess who lives? Finally, there's a ridiculous subplot about a kidnapped baby that gets tacked on for no apparent reason and a hollow attempt at creating a suspenseful climax that takes place in (so original...) a slaughterhouse.Any sense of humour that the original had (dark as it may be) is also gone, leaving this one-note movie that really should never have been made.I will credit the movie for having a nice visual flair, which must have been what attracted me to the trailer. If only the rest of the movie could have been that good. The original may not be perfect, but for now it's the best we've got.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was such an awesome horror movie! Certainly, the acting was not oscar quality by any means, but it wasn't terrible and you have got to realize...THIS IS A HORROR MOVIE. I think the way they start and end the movie is a nice touch. The beginning of the original does give an eerie feel, but the ending gives no real conclusion. The plots of the two versions are similar as in they both have a leatherface, 5 kids, and the heroine is female. Other than that, not much is the same. I feel leatherface has more to him in the new one. He's not simply a person wearing skin on his face who kills people like in the original. Overall, the plot just has more substance to it in the remake, and the atmosphere is just scarier. This remake has a very nice way of building up the creepiness, the anticipation, the suspense, and the feeling that "you are alone and there is no one to call or turn to". Then you have killing. Also, this movie has just the right amount of blood; there is not too much at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you walk into the theater for the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you will jump, you will scream, and you will be disturbed out of your mind. Now, I was very much hoping that this would be a good movie, and doubted that it could top the original. However, it did. It was all a fan of the original could have ever hoped for. Not only is it horrifyingly scary (I cannot remember the last time i jumped this much in a theater), but the story is true to the original, and even elaborates on the original, concocting a story for Leatherface and his family. This movie even has good acting, which I thought was definitely not going to happen. Every shot, every angle, every moment was perfect. Director Marcus Nispel takes Tobe Hooper's classic film and twists it around perfectly. Even a little of the dark humor that made the original such a classic is in this movie. Also, the imagery and sets are ideal for this movie, envoking a horrifically disturbing mood. This movie put you the viewer into the shoes of the hopelessly doomed victims trying to escape the blaring, fear-envoking roar of Leatherface's chainsaw. You pray for survivors. You pray for the rain of terror and madness to end! In a summary, this movie delivered chills, thrills, and disturbing images, makinging it all you could ever hope for in a horror movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[contains spoilers] Ok i have to get one thing out in the open, the original is not all that great maybe 25 years ago yes but with todays standards in horror the original has nothing on the remake and i went into the remake with an open mind thinking that this will be great and it wasn't great it was fantastic.Ok from the explosive head shot at the start to the big slaughterhouse battle in the end of the film i knew we were in good hands this movie is so dark it goes alot further then most hollywood made horror films and raises the bar in torture and suspense.The acting in this movie is fantastic i wont stress this enough Jessica Biel can act and she has a great set of lungs, she is not annoying like the other girl from the original, And kudos to the supporting cast they all did a good job of being scared s***less.And some more things that were great about this film were that this leather face was more of a killing machine and not a serial killer who wares makeup and acts like a cleaning lady for those hick bastards in the original, and thankgod there was no fat guy in a wheelchair i wanted him to get it first in the original but he survived till the end.And kudos to Marcus Nispel you have directed a outstanding horror film and i hope you have a long life in film keep up the good work. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I hate to admit it, but this "unnecessary remake" is pretty bloody disturbing....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I grudgingly saw the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake yesterday. Usually I'm the first one to criticize these unnecessary remakes (for example, I will never see Gus Van Sant's sacreligious Psycho remake, and I'm thinking of standing outside the theatre and boycotting former-cool-director Tim Burton's upcoming remake of Willy Wonka) -- make all the arguments you want defending remakes like these, but it doesn't change the fact that they represent a lack of imagination and originality coming out of "Hollywood." Yes, there are definite exceptions (Martin Scorsese's Cape Fear and John Carpenter's The Thing come to mind), but, most often, you get junk like the awful, cgi-infested Haunting remake and Burton's boring Planet of the Apes (what's happened to Burton's creativity? Well, I'm getting off track.)The TCM remake had other strikes going against it, too, in my opinion. The big one -- it was produced by, I honestly believe, one of the worst directors in the last ten years, Michael Bay. Thankfully, Mr. Fast-Cut-Edit didn't direct the thing. The other strike was the casting of teen beauty Jessica Biel in the main role. Nothing against her -- I just didn't think she'd live up to the terrified, shrieking brilliance of Marilyn Burns in the original. Well, she didn't, but she wasn't terrible. I was impressed.So, anyway, with these strikes in mind, I went in with pretty low expectations, so maybe that's why I was delightfully surprised. I'm gonna swallow my pretentious pride right now and admit that the TCM remake isn't bad. In fact, a lot of it is downright dark and disturbing. Despite being produced by Bay, the direction isn't all fast cuts and mind-numbing edits (something that was actually done well by Tobe Hooper in the original TCM), and, here and there, it's pretty damn scary. It's also one of the most violent movies I've ever seen (and I have seen a LOT of these kinds of movies.) It's like the filmmakers wanted to take the reputation of the original (which really isn't that graphically violent at all) and make the new movie as gory and bloody as people who never saw the original assumed it was. The violence is so disturbing in this movie because the Sawyer family (namely that lovable, huggable Leatherface) don't just kill their victims -- they keep them alive for a while, hanging on hooks, missing limbs, and work on them slowly -- so there's a lot of sadistic torture and realistic pain portrayed throughout the last half of the movie. I'm almost surprised, in fact, that this got past the ratings board with a mere "R" rating. Also, unlike the original, it's the guys in this one that get the worst of it, a pretty interesting role reversal in the slasher genre.Forget about Rob Zombie's everthing-and-the-kitchen-sink, MTV-video mess House of 1,000 Corpses -- the TCM remake is the real '70s/'80s slasher homage of the year. It's like a throwback to some of those dark and depraved slashers that came out seemingly every other week back then. Trust me, this is not at all like the typical teeny-bopper "slashers" that have come out in the wake of the Scream movies. This one is truly twisted. I actually had a nightmare about this movie the night after I saw it -- I haven't had a nightmare from a scary movie since I was ten!One criticism: Leatherface is given some unneccessary background (and you even get to see his face), but, fortunately, he is given just enough screen time to be effectively scary. I don't agree with the reviewer here who wanted to see more of him -- too much Leatherface would be overkill, he's best used sparingly for maximum shock effect. But, in a brilliant casting move, R. Lee Ermey (Full Metal Jacket) pops up in one of those roles he plays to the hilt (incidentally, he was also fun in the Willard remake earlier this year -- another remake that's pretty good. Hmm, maybe I need to rethink my whole "remake philosophy"...)So, to conclude -- no, this doesn't quite have that manic, low-budget creepy brilliance of the original, but I do think it's ten times better than Leatherface: TCM III and that ridiculous fourth one with Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey (which were every bit as much remakes of the original as this one is, if you think about it). So, all of you purists out there who might be resisting this remake of an American horror classic, do like I did -- go see it with low expectations and you might be surprised. It will give you the willies.</fullReview>

Ever since I heard that Marilyn Manson scored the soundtrack, (www.mtv.com for details) I wanted to see it, whether it was bad or not. Going to the movie, thinking it was going to be awful, I realized, time really does fly when one's having fun. I was impressed that the acting pretty good, and it seemed like it could really happen. Hats off to Jessica Beil (AkA Erin, which is my name too :D)The movie was really fun because everytime something scary happened the whole audience screamed, and it was packed full of people Some girls were crying when we walked out saying "They'd never see it again. and how can that kill still be out there?!" I personally found it realistic, and worth my money, but it's not for non-horror fans. You have to appriciate what a good movie this was since other scary movies are such a let down lately. I say go see it with your friends for a good time, and scream your brains out. Overall, I give this film a 9/10</fullReview>

When I went and saw this movie with my Boyfriend, it kept us both on the edge of our sits, no other horror movie has done that... This movie made you have some sympathy for the actors...I am so glad that the sexy star of the blair witch project 2 Erica Leerhsen who's acting blew me away started in this film, and Andrew Bryniarski did a wonderful job in playing LeatherFace...Even if this film has a bunch of questions that needed answers. I hope New Line will make a part 2... And for those who love the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre its o.k. if you love that film and consider it the best horror film of all time...But truly guys...Get over it... It was cheap and low-budget...And it did not have what Gore fans were looking for. Even if this movie was $13,000,000 to make, this sure did a good job. Unlike the other one $140,000...Give me those $140,000 and lets see what I'll come up with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original is still the all time classic, but this had its moments. R.Lee Ermey was brilliant casting as the sadistic cop. Jessica Biel's breasts were nice. Otherwise, this was a fairly rote exercise in gore with interesting stylistic experiments (like the inexplicable "Blair Witch" rip-off, with the quasi-documentary footage) that sometimes work ,sometimes not. Leatherface had a skin disease? What a dumb-ass idea. Do we really need to feel sympathy for him? I think it's scarier if the characters and the audience don't know the reasons why the killers act the way they do (a la "House of 1000 Corpses.) Anyway, effects were good, people screamed and jumped in the audience, what more do you want for a matinee? Although some dumb-ass frat boys and their dates decided to keep a running commentary going through the whole film behind me "Dude, don't go in there!"-you get the idea. Worth a rental when it comes out, but buy the original on DVD instead.</fullReview>

Did "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" really need a big budget rendition? My first reaction was NOOOOOOOO!!! Could a Jessica Biel version be scarier than the first movie? Is it possible? It's a tough call. I'm not sure. What I am sure of is that the new version of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is an outstanding horror flick.You'll know what you're in for in the first few minutes.*DEATH SPOILER*A group of teens pick up a girl wandering down the road. When she gets into the van, she starts freaking out about the possibility of going back to Leatherface and family. She pulls out a gun and blows the back of her head off. The camera pans back from the screaming kids, THROUGH the suicide victim's skull, and out the back car window. Then the camera does an extreme close-up on the girl's lips. You get to see smoke coming out of her mouth from the gunshot. Oh yeah. I knew I was in good hands.*END SPOILER*The rest of the flick is Jessica Biel and friends running for their lives from Leatherface. The prevailing atmosphere in this movie is one of doom and gloom. It keeps that vibe until the very end. While the movie is brutal, the gore is relatively low. Leatherface has his chainsaw buzzing overtime but you don't get to see him dig into people as much as you would think. Or hope."Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is a great horror movie. I loved every second of it. Loved it. My dad saw it with me and he HATED it. I mean he hated it with a passion. As he said, "That stupid movie was needlessly cruel and vicious." Yes! Exactly! Couldn't have said it better myself! Except for the movie being stupid, I agree!"Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is one of the best horror flicks of the year. It was very sick for a mainstream movie. Brutal, nasty and quite demented. Just like all good horror should be. If you're into horror flicks, you've got to check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** This is seriously one of the best horror movies I've seen in the last 5 years. It rates up there with "The Ring","Mothman Prophecies", etc..Now, before you go in and see the movie, go in with an open mind. If you go in wishing for an exact remake of the original, you will be sadly, sadly disappointed. This is a film in itself, and may have well been a sequel. But on to the overview.*****(((( ---=== POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD ===--- ))))*****August 18th, 1973. A group of 5 young, college-aged adults are on there way through texas to mexico to see a concert, and collect drug money. Having just picked up a hitchhiker no less then 19 hours ago, the teens find themselves driving through a rural texas back-route. A few minutes pass by, smoking a few joints, some back-seat hippie style making out, and a mysterious young girl is seen walking on the side of the road. The youths stop the car, and offer the girl a ride. Once inside the car, they keep an ever-so-graceful eye on there new friend. Soon they find out that the 5 will die if they don't turn around. Shortly after stating this, she removes a 6-Shot revolver from her vagina and commits suicide.Then the Nightmare Begins.Soon, the main characters rush to the nearest store (which just happens to be in an abandoned town at a BBQ store filled with dead, rotting pig flesh and meat.) After trying to get help, the youths are told to drive to the old Crawford Mill and wait for help. There, they meet the little degenerate ugly freak, Jedidiah. Soon, the 2 Main characters (Erin and her Boyfriend), walk to a nearby house to use the fone. Soon, Erin's boyfriend is meat-cleavered in the back, taken into a furnace room, and skinned alive (off-screen). And that's how it starts. From there on in, it's just straight cliched killing, but has some surprises. This movie will shock you, fright you, make you jump, and will leave some disturbing images in your head for a day or so. (Ie. The finger nail scene, and the overly stretched demonic head.).The cinematography in this movie is fantastic. The use of the muted colors and the green/blue/stale color pallet really sets the perfect horror tone to this movie. You will love the camera angles, especially the ones involving Jessica Biel and her ever so jiggly and happy breasts.This movie was a grade A+ horror film, in the slasher sense. With just the right amount of gore, saddistic torture, and maiming you will love. This is the perfect slasher movie. I can recommend you bring along a date that scares easily, so that you can score some points! :)9/10, Grade: A.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, first things first. The original "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is one of my all-time favorite movies. If you ask me, no other horror movie comes quite so close to making you feel true, frenzied terror like that film. It's like an actual nightmare. And it does that with very little gore, one of the many things the makers of this remake apparently don't understand.I should also say that I am NOT one of those purists who was just waiting to tear the remake apart. In fact, I was looking forward to it, mostly because of the really good trailer. It started off good. We hear that infamously creepy squeaking-noise from the original, and the familiar, slightly different John Larroquette voice-over. And it's still set in 1973 - thank goodness for that. It wouldn't be "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" without 5 hippies in a van. But these 5 hippies are reciting some very lame dialogue, and already it's headed downhill, only a few minutes in. The course of events is completely different, though we do check in with some classic moments that have been changed around (hitchhiker, meat hook, Leatherface leg wound, etc...) but none of the changes are for the better. In fact, most of them downright suck. Of the 5 hippies, only Jessica Biel is memorable, and that's just because, well, it's Jessica Biel and I liked her in "The Rules Of Attraction".The psycho family is the real embarrassment. In the original they were truly scary, deranged lunatics. Here they seem like actors and are just kind of goofy. Most silly of all is a little kid in the family who tries to lead Biel and another victim to safety. That's just stupid, and it's unrealistic Hollywood plotting like that that is so thankfully absent from the original. And another low-blow: WE SEE LEATHERFACE'S FACE! Stupid, stupid, stupid.The best thing about this movie is its outdoor cinematography. I like the way the camera is always gliding one direction or another as it observes the increasingly frantic characters. That would be even cooler if the characters were more interesting or the writing didn't really suck.If you haven't seen the original, now's the time. Because this well-filmed but totally phony remake doesn't do it justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review - 3.5 out of 4</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying what will most likely p*ss off a lot of people: I never liked the original. Yes, tell me to burn in hell for saying it, but only a few things worked for me in the original (the girl shoved up on the hook while Leatherface killed her boyfriend in front of her and the dinner scene). I won't deny the influence the film had on the genre - this was a very different style made with a small budget. It looked good, had a descent cast and a director that was fully capable - but when it comes down to it, I never could understand how easily these characters got themselves into the situation they did. Because of that I could never really care for them at all. Sorry, but I've given the film two chances now and I still don't like it at all.On to the remake, it was what I always wanted out of the original. It was very shocking and jump out of your seat at parts - but the characters were well developed enough this time for me to actually care what happened to me. The visuals in this one worked so much better - not just the cinematography (which is top notch) but the look of everything and the characters especially. They even added dimension to Leatherface that was mostly taken from serial killer Ed Gein (the original touched upon this, but didn't establish it as much as done here), and the second mask he wears would scare the living s**t out of me if I were in that girls position.If you want to find a slasher film that is actually jolting, chilling, and disturbing as all hell, check it out. This is a lot bloodier than most movies though, so be warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must first address the legions of simple minded retards who are fixated on the fact that this film and another just so happen to share the same name. Sure, there are similarities and nods to the original TCM through various shots and lines of dialogue and set pieces, but that's about it. The ad campaign for this film did not promote it as a remake. It was promoted as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre; nothing more and nothing less. Take that how you will, but it is recommended to just appreciate the references and enjoy this ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FILM for what it is.I have seen the Texas Chainsaw Massacre well over one hundred times. I can speak along with the dialogue, I make about one reference to the film in my daily life, regardless of how I fit it in there (not consciously, it just seems to happen that way) and I was just as skeptical as everyone else when I heard that this film was being made. I was even more skeptical and slightly nauseated by the fact that Michael Bay was involved. However as this supposed "remake" neared release, I began to read several interviews with the cast and crew, who, in all honesty, did not seem like they were trying to better the original. In fact, it just seemed to me that they wanted to give the film a proper sequel perhaps or just re-realize the potential power of a chainsaw wielding maniac with a heart of gold and bring it to modern generations.And a damn fine job they did, as far as I'm concerned. This film is raw, nasty and gritty in a way that hasn't been seen in horror films since perhaps the late eighties. It puts these putrid piles of teenage vomit that hollywood has been trying to pass off as horror films to bed and then it craps on their sheets.Congratulations to Marcus Nispel, for he has made a film to satisfy the bloodlust of our nation once again. He gives hope to the horror fiends by showing us that it's still possible to show terribly grotesque things in theaters and that we don't have to settle for watered down piles of dung about ghosts with SURPRISE ENDINGS any longer. Let us all hope that other directors will follow suit and bring a new age of depravity and maladjusted youngsters to our movie theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say that I totally disagree with the IMDb review of this film, as I feel very strongly that this movie was good. People are very against remakes these days, which I don't see why. I see remakes as a chance to spice a movie up a little bit and to bring it up to date with the times. Other people see these movies as piles of garbage that will "ruin" the originals. How the remake would ruin the original, I have no idea. These kinds of people shouldn't think freely, because they do a bad job at it.Tobe Hooper's legendary original THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE, was a mind bending head-trip. We all know that. People always brag about how the movie didn't try to scare you as much with sadistic gore, but rather how it tried to impose creepiness soley through the power of suggestion. But then again, those people need to realize that THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE (the original) was a very violent movie. It had violence up the ass, and no one can deny it. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT tried more to scare the audience through the power of suggestion. Hooper's film did not.However, this remake doesn't care about trying to scare you through the power of suggestion, because it knows that it doesn't have to. The cast is somewhat forgettable, although their performances are almost Oscar caliber in the sense of this being a horror movie. If you were being chased by a freak with a chainsaw, you wouldn't act much different than these people do. People always say something like "oh if that was me, I would do----". No you wouldn't. You would be too scared to even think about doing that.Back on the subject of this film being a remake, I have some more to say. The film isn't really that much of a remake. It borrows heavily from the first film the main concept and idea, but pretty much the entire script has been rewritten. Of course there are a bunch of similarities, but the bulk of the film is a lot different than the original. I have been waiting for this film since like, May of 2003 and now that it has finally come out, I am just so gleefully happy. FREDDY VS. JASON is nothing compared to this film. But the horror films previous to this one were also very exciting.The whole motif of this remake was that it was supposed to be "more suspenseful". Which, I thought it was. I jumped several times and so did the friends that I went with. We also the movie to be darkly hilarious. The only complaint we had was that Leatherface was not given the screen time and attention that he deserved. There were many new "family" members added into the film and I think they sort of hogged some of Leatherface's rightful screen time. The chainsaw is scary as hell, and the film takes you on a shocking journy of fear that you won't be able to shake off. If you are like me, and enjoy nightmares, then you will love this. The movie is certainly a fun time and if you didn't see it on opening night (we saw it on opening night) then I recommend that you see it as soon as humanly possible. I don't care what people say, this remake is better. See also some of this year's finer horror films: WRONG TURN, FREDDY VS. JASON, or HOUSE OF THE DEAD. All in all, this is a nice, spooky, goody-bag of a Halloween treat.THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE: 5/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Michael Bay Touch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By now we know pretty well what to expect from a Michael Bay-produced movie: melodramatic stories that go pole-vaulting past any plot holes; frenetic editing that can obscure what's happening, and where, and when, and why; big splashy SFX; thunderously ear-splitting sounds; cute chicks wearing as little as is feasible. This new "Massacre" has all that in spades, which makes it even more pleasantly surprising when it actually manages to achieve some quiet, effectively gruesome moments.For those who have seen the original "Massacre" and want to know how this one matches up: it's not really trying to, from what I can tell. Aside from the title and the basic storyline and the Leatherface character, not much is retained. Even if Mr. Bay et al. had wanted to capture the effect of the original bare-bones shot-on-the-fly-in-sequence raw naturalistic excursion into sadistic humor with it's real blood and real bones and real pain for the actors, it would've been impossible nowadays, so they wisely didn't try. The essence of the original was the long set piece toward the end with the sloppily executed blood ritual and the family members laughing insanely at the vicitim's terrified screams. The remake skips this sequence altogether. What we have here is another high-budget slickly executed slasher flick with gore similar to "Wrong Turn" in intensity but "Cabin Fever" in quantity. Also tries for some warped humor but mostly falls short there.The best part's the beginning (I mean once we're past that stupid "Blair Witch"y "documentary" footage) with the kids in the top-heavy Dodge van (I had one of those once, it handled like a river barge) getting stoned on their way to a Lynryd Skynryd concert; very nice sense of time and place there. As in the original, there's a hitchhiker, but with a clever twist whose repercussions help smooth over the plot machination we expect from every horror flick, i.e. "How do we get this group of more or less sensible people into a situation where all they can do is scream, panic, try to flee and die?"The turning point's the arrival of the R. Lee Ermey character; he's the best thing in it but from then on, whenever he's not onscreen it's pretty much Been-there-seen-that. I find this guy fascinating, a real-life ex-Marine who only got into acting because Kubrick used him to play a Marine and who then revealed he could play pretty much anything, even a judge once. Rather than trying to be a chameleon disappearing into each part, Ermey works each part to fit his talents. I've never seen a flick where he wasn't the best thing in it. The scariest scene in the new "Massacre" is one with no gore and no chainsaws: it's just Ermey in a car with a scared kid and a gun as a prop. (There was no such scene in the original, so I didn't know where they were going with it.) Ermey has the Murray Hamilton ability to exude slimy sickness through his pores and the Dennis Hopper ability to let his mind wander in character, so we sit there with no way of knowing what kind of perverted crap it could occur to him to do, because he doesn't know yet himself. It's just plain brilliant.Jessica Biel, running faster from her "Seventh Heaven" background than her character does from Leatherface, and Eric Balfour from "Six Feet Under" are the only other cast members I recognized and managed to make me somewhat regret their impending horrible demise, which is a feat in this kind of movie. The psycho family members look the part but there's no sense of them as a group, no hint of back-story except that Leatherface was once a "nice boy" with a skin disease. This incarnation of Leatherface is actually kinda lame, even with all his screen time. Late in the going they seem to want him to be Jason or Michael Myers from other movies. Couldn't just leave Gunnar-Hansen-well-enough alone, I guess.Should you go see this new "Massacre"? Sure, why not, it delivers a decent quantity of goods, NEVER WINKS AT ITSELF (Lord, I hated that recent horror trend) and may even get people interested in seeing the original, or seeing it again, always a good thing. I just hope they leave it alone now and don't try a new set of sequels. ENOUGH ALREADY. There are OTHER real-life whack-jobs than Ed Gein who could inspire a good spooky story, even without human skin arts &amp; crafts....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Uninteresting remake of Tobe Hooper's chilling classic features slicker camera-work, bigger production values and a lot more gore, but features only a little of the dark humor and tension of the original. In fact, even the chase-scenes and tedious. Listen carefully, Michael Bay; louder and gorier does not equal scarier. inexplicably, this became a success and it was followed by a prequel titled,'The Texas chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning' which I have not seen (and this remake doesn't make me very eager to). Also inexplicable is the fact that many seem to prefer this version! AAAGGRRHHH!!!! Seriouly folks, stick with the original.End of review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Style over Substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember raving how great the trailer for this film was. It had a tone, a style, a feeling of eeriness, but didn't tell much of the story. The movie itself was pretty much the same. It really is beautifully shot, which is a surprising aspect to notice in a horror flick. The lighting, camera work and design are quite well done and really create a wonderful tone. Even the acting, while a bit over-the-top, is not bad. The problem is the story. What there is of a story, anyway. I've not seen the original, and really don't plan to. I'm willing to forgive a flimsy plot in a crap horror film, but in a film like this that has some things going for it, it's disappointing. And for a film like the original, that so many people regard as a classic, such a weakness only points out how overrated and undeserving it is. They're apparently already considering sequels, which was obvious from the glaring open ending, but I wish they'd let this series die. Still, give this director a decent project. There's potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Especially the ending is nothing but a lousy joke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I was kind of interested when I heard about the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and at that time, I didn't knew it was a remake. So I decided to watch this movie.The beginning of the movie is quite good, I think, the story with the hitch-hiker is the same thing as in the 1974 movie, but the story is a bit different and nevertheless quite creative. But the first sequence, this "documentary scene", show in which way the whole movie moves: It is needlessly dramatized, and I think it shall be a homage on the factual documentary style of the original movie. But I think it's rather ridiculous than scaring or authentic.After the scene the hitch-hiker shot herself, it is very very dramatized, you can see very clearly that Michael Bay is a Hollywood Blockbuster director. It's all that pompous and overdone, those mixture of brutality (different from the original movie, this one is needlessly bloody) and what they think might be excitement (the scene where the chainsaw is just few centimeters away from Jessica Biel's head, and she might die, while everybody knows she's the star and won't die). Everything about this movie is so exaggerated dark and cruel and pathetic. It is a horror Blockbuster, to me. The best thing about that movie is that Jessica Biel is allowed to hold her sexy body in the camera until the end of the movie. So far, it would be six out of ten.But then the ending, which is simply lousy. There is this baby inside this room, and it the next sequence it is sitting in Jessica Biel's car (she must be a magician, I guess). Then she wants to drive away, but Leatherface (whom she hacked away his arm a while before) attacks her (with the saw in his one arm, sure ...) You see how Biel's car drives away in the night, and then this ridiculous documentary scene comes again. You see a few village cops go down the stairs to the basement where Leatherface "worked", one of them speaking their observations into a microphone. When they are down the stairs, Leatherface attacks the talking guy, and this is the end of this movie. Nobody can tell me that the police departments would send just a few moron cops to the scene of the crime, when they know it is such a hard crime. And nobody would enter the scene of crime that much naively, when the committer is not yet arrested. Pure dramatization. This really ridiculous ending makes the film just a laugh to me.The movie is much too pathetic, much too dramatized, and it will never get the level of the 1974 Texas Chainsaw Massacre Original. But the end of the movie turned it from a quite decent movie into a really lousy joke.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it's the 70's, kids on a road-trip have bought drugs over the border. meet a girl walking (down the road in a catatonic state) from an unknown danger who kills herself in their van.the kids meet the local sheriff at some copper mill &amp; Jedediah, some greasy little kid. a guy letting some of the kids call the sheriff tries it on with one girl, and her male friend comes to explore &amp; gets killed by leatherface.sheriff shows up at the mill and is horrible. this film is very much about what you think you see, not what you actually see.the car with it's horn jammed is a distraction from the kids van for a reason, the kid in glasses doing the fake scare is rubbish, you can tell he's faking.2 of them go back to the danger house, the boy sneaks inside the house looking for his missing friend. the kids are clearly in more danger from the sheriff than Leatherface.no way would the kid on the meathook be able to pull it out of his own body while he was hanging on it. taking the arrested boy to the danger house shows the sheriff is involved, I assume Jedadiah loosened their tires while they were checking the jammed horn.leatherface when he attacks the girls in the van is wearing the face of the 1st boy to be taken, the call the sheriff made was sent to leatherface. the 2 women in the trailer are weird and must know Leatherface, you assume the tea she's offered is drugged. them saying the tea will help her relax is a give-away there. which it is, she wakes up in the house with one of the woman and the sheriff, Jedediah calls her grandma, leatherface is HER son.they say leatherface is kind. everyone else is evil for teasing him. he hasn't got a NOSE! the fact that leatherface doesn't kill the final girl right away is also a give away that she's going to live. the 2nd boy on the meat-hook could have put his feet on top of the piano and pushed himself off the hook. we weren't shown the piano earlier, mistake/goof? You can't tell if Jedadiah is trying to help her and Morgan or suckering them into another trap (which it seems like to me). Them running into an abandoned house like place where he carves an X in the door (a reference to Freddy or Jason?) and she hides him in a closet and hides in a crawl space herself.Oh, and how can a chainsaw keep running when it's dropped (I'd have assume the engine would stop right away). leatherface kills the boy after hanging him from a chandelier (again, you see nothing you just think you do) and of course it's the final chase of the last living girl by leather-face.leatherface hits his thigh with chainsaw (isn't that the femoral artery?), he should die in a few minutes. he isn't going to chasing her after that little injury. and chasing to the slaughterhouse (no, he'd have bled to death by then). her going into the freezer. And you can actually see it isn't physically cold in there (her nipples aren't hard and they really should be in a freezer), she doesn't get goosebumps and she's only wearing a thin vest top.She obviously isn't getting very wet with the sprinklers on, her top should either go see through or cling to her like a second skin and reveal her bra. After running from him for so long and successfully hiding in a locker why does she try to attract his attention. the moving locker obviously had a pig in it, so she could attack him from behind with the meat cleaver she picked up.(there is a very brief scene where you can clearly see him with one arm inside his top wearing the artificial arm she cut half off.with 1 arm cut off AND a femoral injury he's going to bleed to death or go into shock. he isn't going to carry on chasing anyone with a damn chainsaw. And even in the tipping, pouring rain her top isn't very wet.she gets a lift from a trucker and she mirrors the way their own hitch hiker acted (and now you understand why). the trucker tries the diner for help (and the old lady calls the sheriff "junior" so you know he is part of their murderous family).she steals his car and you think she's killed the sheriff knocking him down but she definitely does by backing up over him and driving back over him a 3rd time. the scare where leather-ace attacks the stolen police car is pointless. she drives away from him &amp; the chainsaw is revving. HOW? Leatherface has one hand, this is IMPOSSIBLE! cut back to the movie, the state police investigating the crime scene, the Hewitt house (danger house) and the final predictable scare is them getting attacked by leatherface with a voice over leaving things open enough to make a sequel of this dire and awful remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jessica Biel in tight jeans and t-shirt was about the only thing worth watching in this snorefest. Sure, there were a couple of your average grisly deaths and some "make you jump" moments... standard slasher flick stuff that we've all seen before. But in between the decent action sequences were long stretches where characters who were alternately annoying and yawn-inducing just walked around, sat around, or ran around doing very little of interest... just screaming, whining and crying until someone else got killed. The characters often did things that made no sense at all... why does Leatherface throw Erin down into the basement and then leave her to wander around and escape instead of maiming her on the spot like the others? Why does Erin use a giant knife to put a friend out of his misery, and then not take the knife with her as she goes wandering in the house? There were gaping holes and inconsistencies throughout the "plot."Overall, this movie didn't scare me or entertain me. In fact, the DVD special features about Ed Gein and serial killer movies were more engaging than the main feature itself. Even the surround audio mix was lackluster. Perhaps I'll track down a copy of the original and see if I like that any better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Remake But Not a Patch on the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I am certain you all know, this film is a remake of the 1974 film "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre", directed by Tobe Hooper. While the re-make keeps the basic plot line of a group of young people being menaced by a sadistic family of cannibals (including horror icon Leatherface), it is a completely different film to the original. Where as the first film was gritty, low-budget and raw, this is glossy, expensive and produced by blockbuster director Michael Bay.For what it is, the remake isn't too bad. It's fun, exciting and occasionally quite suspenseful. Jessica Biel makes for an appealing heroine and R. Lee Ermey has a fun role as a psychotic sheriff. However, it lacks the intensity and savagery that made the original so memorable. The remake also contains all the plentiful gore that was absent from the original.</fullReview>

A great chance for flashbacks into the troubling youth of leatherface and his family circus. It is about time for the revival of great gore flicks with a great story full of detail to back it up. This movie reminded me of "Seven" or even a little "Silence Of the Lambs". We are past the cheap B -Slasher movies of the 70's and need some stories with great scripts and production design value such as TCM Redux.This movie would be chalk full of opportunities to be another horror classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a great horror movie. I personally thought this was better than the original. I mean the remake was way more scary, and cooler in the gore category. Some people say that the original was scarier but I truly disagree. People say that Leatherface is just plain disturbing in the original but in the remake he is ten times worse. The original would maybe scare me in 1974 if I saw it in theaters and I was under the age of five. The remake has a better story and more well developed characters, it actually makes you think the story was real! Oh, and for those of you who think the story is real, you're wrong. The Leatherface character is based on a 1950's cereal killer named Ed Gein, the rest is made up. The only way to get the best effect from the movie is to watch it in surround sound. I saw it in theaters and it's in my personal top-five horror movies list.Mel's advise: See this movie in surround sound at night with a group of people. If you just watch it on basic two-speaker sound you probably won't like it.I give the Texas Chainsaw Massacre a perfect 10/10</fullReview>

As in this case.[POSSIBLE SPOILERS OF ORIGINAL CLASSIC MOVIE]The plot has been changed, with many of the original film's most disturbing and controversial scenes either being removed or changed (no room full of human furniture, no girls on meat hooks, no dead armadillo, no disabled guy in wheelchair falling down a bank and pissing on himself).[END OF SPOILERS]And, of course the sickening atmosphere of the first movie was created by an extraordinarily abstract soundtrack - so that had to go.So what we have is yet another neutered bastardization of a timeless classic.

		<fullReview>Whilst I'm sure this film will appeal to teenagers who know nothing of the original, I found it so disappointing. I was always suspicious of how they would attempt to remake a film that was so brilliant the way it was, but then I thought it might be like the Psycho remake where they tried to keep true to the original. Unfortunately this was not the case. They've changed every aspect of the film, so it is beyond recognition. They've cheapened the experience, taking the scariness out of it by replacing psychological irony with gore. Hollywood horror cliches are rife, and when the film opens with a Blair Witch Project rip-off, its obvious that this film is going to be rubbish.If you're going to remake a film, improve it. Otherwise just leave it well alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>August 18 1973, a group of young adults travel along the countryside on a summer drive in rural Texas picking up a hitchhiker and she committed suicide in the van as they decide to seek help at an old farmhouse. However, they discover that the house is a death-trap with a demented family of cannibals including Leatherface (Andrew Bryniarsky) and an insane sheriff (R. Lee Ermy) whom wants them dead for supper.Fine remake of the 1974 horror classic but not necessary and didn't need to be remade cause it wasn't broke! When i first heard that there was going to be a remake instead of a sequel to the Tobe Hooper masterpiece i was outraged with the other fans but when this opened at number 1 at the box-office (just like the original), it turned out to be a nasty and grim surprise. Although it's not as good as the original or the "Dawn of the Dead" remake, there's plenty of torture with gore, decent acting mainly by Ermy and the lovely Jessica Biel plus Ryan Reynolds, good camera-work and shocks abound but can't hold a grudge to the 1974 version and TCM parts 2 &amp; 3.Still worth watching even for Biel whom just sizzles as a scream-queen in this movie.</fullReview>

It's not the greatest horror movie ever made, and admittedly some of the shock effects are merely cheap tricks: volume raised, continuous screaming, and chainsaws eating through things. But let's be honest that this genre has been so overkilled by cheap tricks and lousy acting that it's refreshing to see a movie that can at least do it effectively - without overusing it. Which isn't say the acting isn't terrible. Actually quite the opposite, and at least we get to see a lot Jessica Biel. The best thing about this movie was the scenery. Typical but terrifyingly imposing. The house was a character all it's own, more frightening than any of the characters. I just hope they don't remake a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so you thought this was a horror flick. Here for your consideration are the top ten reasons why "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is a highly underrated educational film: 1. Don't pick up hitchhikers for any reason, especially if they're going to kill themselves in your back seat.2. When you come across a strange house and you see body parts hanging from the ceiling, it's time to go.3. When you're ready to shoot a schizoid redneck sheriff, be sure the gun is loaded.4. Don't accept tea from strangers.5. When the man with the big chainsaw comes after you, JUST RUN AWAY!6. If you're covered in blood and screaming hysterically, chances are you won't succeed as a hitchhiker.7. Bathtubs can hold a lot of blood.8. A plain old meat cleaver makes a perfectly good weapon and an acceptable choice for self defense.9. It's OK to cheer for the maniac who runs over the local redneck sheriff.10. If you have any fingernails left by the end of this film, find a good manicurist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better remakes I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2003 version of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre served its purpose as an updated version of the original 1974 classic. What I really liked about this movie was the cinematography, as all the scenes and sets had that eerie feel to it.(Especially the creepy and dark house in the middle of nowhere) Jessica Biel played as good a heroine as Nev Campbell(Scream) and Jaime Lee Curtis(Halloween) because like them, and unlike the other 200 hundred or so who have imitated them, she was believable. I was hooked into her screaming,crying,and running because she captured how someone might feel in that situation. The stand out performance of the movie though has to go to R Lee Emery who did an excellent job as the sheriff. And cops wonder why some people are terrified of them. The movie really picks up in the final 30 minutes and the scenes inside the house and the meat factory are downright chilling. It was also a nice touch that John Laroquette, who narrated the original, agreed to do the same for this movie. The musical score at the end credits really adds to the effect of what you've just witnessed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horribly bad slasher-movie with no depth whatsoever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie presented itself as a very bad slasher-movie indeed. There was no depth that could keep the viewer thrilled. The movie took its whole momentum from gore scenes and scream-esque shock effects. Although it was disgusting and the characters where a freak show it never was disturbing. Furthermore it was simply boring, there was no twist or catch and not one plotline got evolved. I know that Leatherface is a important part of US history (in that it shows degeneracy and incest in small outside towns) but remaking this not-so-bad movie into this monstrosity of a waste of money isn't understandable. Unfortunately the Director comes from there same town as I and it was his first major motion picture after some video clips. I doubt that the script has gotten him lots of options and Michael Bay as producer you should expect something very shallow but at least slightly entertaining. But this was only loud and undistinguishable noise in a sea of ordered information...not worth the celluloid 1 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How NOT To Redo A Classic Horror Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I say anything else, the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre scared the living daylights out of me, and I was in my early/mid 20's when I first saw it. The original film was relentless, with this whole feel of trying to push you over the top psychologically while just simply freaking you out. I think that's why when the heroine finally escapes the house after being in there all night, the results were so jarring. The original movie never lets up for a second once the terror began.This film? I wanted the lights to let up so I could leave.I don't know what the deal is with all of these remakes these days. Perhaps Hollywood is just secretly begging for new ideas, and revamping past successes until they figure something new out.This film tries to be like the original, and tell this tale as if this is the "real deal" of the story. Once they blew the first kill, the one that had actually shocked me from the original due to its instant and unexpected brutality, I knew this wasn't going to be the same.This version lacked all of the grittiness of the original, and came off as more of a "big-budget" movie. The kids all fell to the typical horror-film stereotypes: You do drugs or make out, you're dead. I could tell in the first five minutes of the film which was going to be the survivor. The kids were stupid and fell for the most obvious of situations. Why is it no one ever listens to the guy who says "I think we should leave right now." They tried to give Leatherface a backstory? Leatherface was EVIL. That's all you really needed to know about him, and I was annoyed that this film contrived situations where you're supposed to feel some shred of empathy for him. The guy was nuts and hacked people up with power tools. I'm not going to invite him over to my place for dinner.Speaking of which, where was the dinner scene? I had felt so uncomfortable during the original, not because it was gruesome, but because you had to sit and watch the heroine get pushed to the brink of insanity over what she was seeing. A classic, vital scene to that movie that showed how messed up the "Leatherface family" truly was, and it's not here. Same as the creepy, deranged hitchhiker.And shame on you, new film, for that contrived and stereotyped big-budget ending. Just HAD to go back for that last-minute rescue, didn't you? Had to deliver that one final typical amount "big budget" justice? If you've seen at least one horror film cliche, you're going to get to revisit several of them here (amusing Harry Knowles "cameo" by the way).Maybe I just expected too much. I wanted more than gore. I wanted my skin to utterly crawl. It's like waiting in line for a rollercoaster only to find out that you've been standing in line for a carousel.Stick to the original if you want to be scared. Go see this one if you want a mindless popcorn film. But you'll have seen the majority of this movie in countless other slasher films. And that's what this classic horror film has been reduced to: A slasher film without at least the self-parodying personality of a Freddy or Jason movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What would you do with $13 Million???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original TCM was no humanist work. It was remorselessly punishing on the viewers of its day. The remake matches it, outdoing the originals savagery for the new audience. --No big gripe there, and no surprise. It is a film about a family of cannibals, after all, the fair-haired offspring of which skins people's heads and uses their faces for masks. It would be hard to imagine a sensitive, tender reading of the original story. Whereas there was room for heart in early horror films like Bride of Frankenstein or The Wolfman, there is none at all here, by the very nature of this tale. That's understood. It's definitely a post-Psycho existential psychological take on human nature.The thing that bothered me, though, as houselights went up, was that the makers had succumbed to the tendency to tell too much, to explain, to rationalize, to be mundanely anecdotal, even. --To take the horror that is even more horrible because it is seemingly blank and random and senseless, like most violence we hear about or experience, and frame it in terms of a bad skin condition, mockery by ones peers in adolescence, parental protectiveness, etc. Once we take what is possibly THE quintessential nihilistic horror scenario and try to make it make sense in these everyday terms, how far are we from soap opera, or episode TV drama? Not far enough, I'm afraid. In a weak moment, epitomizing this attitude, someone even decided to show Leatherface without his mask. In a movie more open to what I called "heart", this would work. Here, it doesn't. We are told and shown more than we need to know to keep the tension high, and in the elbow room thus created, we start thinking about the technical trick of the makeup that made Leatherface seem deformed. --Which is a fatal place for the audience to roam in a film of this kind. We have to be left to wonder. They can't tell us every gossipy who, what, when, where, why, and how without dissipating what they are so carefully building. That's how the latest TCM fails.Not that it is a total failure. There are some really neat visual tricks here that I won't ruin for you. And the gorgeous production design of the ultimate delapidated environment could have been by the Quay Brothers. The remake of TCM is certainly handsomer than its inspiration, having been run through the After Effects-style wash-spin-dry cycles that give every large budget film made today a heavily-burnished visual sheen generally unknown even five years ago. Like most films today, the look of it is as tightly controlled from frame 1 to frame 172,800 as any TV commercial, with every square inch of the image scrupulously screened and polished to perfection by post production image manipulation on the computer. Frequent cuts back to the glowering killing house serve as the films greatest reminder how of just far the look of movies has come in the last 30 years. Surrounded as it is by a digitally thrice-burned-in sky that would do Ansel Adams proud, the house goes The Hauntings Hill House one better in becoming a vivid character presence within the film.Having said that, though, we have to point out-- don't we?-- that the growing tendency within the audience to confuse a good-looking film with a good film is only further exacerbated by the kind of gussying-up of what is essentially a lump of dirt that this film represents. Cause and effect becomes blurred and finally doesn't matter. The fact that the remake is not any better, if as good, as the original film will be lost on all but those still alive to aesthetic values instilled through a lifetime of careful film-watching. Newer audiences and less-critical fans won't realize the switcheroo being played on them. Technical advances need not damage content or conceal a genuine lack of content. But for both sides of the process, audience and studio, that seems to be exactly what is happening.I don't expect most viewers will ever be able to "reclaim" the original TCM after seeing this version. It's far more explicit, more expertly shot, way more in-your-face than the original. It is typical throw-big-money-after-it film making. The verve and low-budget trial-and-error and discovery, and the resourcefulness of the original films makers, are as missing from the remake as they are from any super-smooth corporate TV commercial you can name. As is so often the case with remakes of older films, the technical finesse at our disposal has insinuated itself into the end product a little too definitively, choking the life out of the original, and moreover rendering its reconstruction pointless. The "expertise" finally seems misspent, and makes you wonder who, in the final analysis, in their right mind, would spend Gone With The Wind or Schindler's List money remaking a no-taste drive-in movie from three decades before?5 stars. Decent execution, but no original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How does this movie get away with thirty million in it's first weekend?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre film released in 1974, co-written by Tobe Hooper with Kim Henkel and directed by Hooper, was one of the first horror films to grab me completely with its atmosphere as a horror film. Sure Hitchcock did that too, but he did that in the mystery/suspense way, while Hooper brought actual fright to me by what he DIDN'T show in the movie. When I look at it today I realize that so much effort was put into what was around these people- the dementia in the house, the zombie-like grandfather, the whole aura projected by the family- that the potency will remain long after this remake has been put to rest in video stores.What made me cringe (and not in a good way, I mean in a contemptible way) at this ugly remake of that film is that the director Marcus Nispel and screenwriter Scott Kosar (and don't say it's 'based on or inspired by a true story'- Henkel and Hooper originated the formula of five teenagers on the road who stop and snoop around and come upon Leatherface, and while Leatherface is based on Gein, the basic story was created by them) forget what made the original so compelling and stick to the new principle with horror moviemakers that the more gore the better. I'm not one to say that all remakes are bad, indeed some of them every once in a while become improvements (Star Wars and Reservoir Dogs are always prime examples for my money). But the skill and power of Hooper's film is replaced completely by an un-redeemably lurid style and a line of plot segments so mechanic and generic for the genre that could only catch those with an IQ under 80 off guard.The changes made in the story: well, the remake does a "same day, different sh*t" approach with five teens in a van (four of them are couples and one of the girls is brother to the fifth, though this time there isn't much comic relief on the part of the brother like in the character of Franklin) returning from Mexico with marijuana who pick up a hitchhiker who commits suicide. They try to contact the sheriff, stop in a spot, and two go off to a house to try the telephone. Then the film goes on autopilot, with one of three things happening, 1) Leatherface going after one or more of the teens, 2) a glimpse for a minute or two at the other family members, or 3) Jessica Biel running around in a tight tank top.Perhaps I may sound cynical, but why just once when I watch one of these horror films can't someone like Leatherface and his pack of cordial family members (one of which played by R. Lee Ermy, who brings no credibility and is really starting to use up his Full Metal Jacket credit) shock the audience in a different way - how about a Texas chainsaw film-noir, where no teens are left as survivors and the rest of the film focuses on the family? It would've been easy for any director to mangle a remake of the original (especially after three remakes, which also raises the question of why they didn't just do part five), and the cast and crew did it to the extent of a complete failure in my view. Whatever they may have been thinking of doing as an homage they did with the grace of the worst hacks in the business.Bottom line, this update for the 'now' of the classic gets vile and grossly disturbing very, very quick. And while I can't stop those who want to see it and enjoy that aspect of the modern horror film (in this case pounding away like a jackhammer), I can try my best to persuade those who are still thinking of seeing it after hearing it grossed 30 million in it's first weekend - reducing Kill Bill, my favorite film of the year and one that used violence and gore to it's stylistic advantage instead of it's cichy device, to second place - to stay home or, better yet, rent the original. Grade: F</fullReview>

This movie is definitely tied at 56 with "The I Inside" which probably won't even be released because it was so bad. I can't say the acting was bad, or the effects, or even the camera work. But it wasn't fun to sit there and watch people die. Whether or not it's a true story, it's a terrible story and a waste of space on IMDB.com. I would rather be brutally tortured by a chainsaw than sit through it again. Total waste of any moviegoer's time. See a good film like "Mystic River", or even "School Of Rock".</fullReview>

To its credit the remake wasn't as bad or insulting as the "Dawn of the Dead" remake but there was no reason for any one to want to change the original. The good things...the chainsawed leg and the rock salt, the meat hook. Now the bad um...the cast. I didn't like anyone except the guy who played Letherface (at least he did it with a little passion) and R. Lee Hermy. But the thing that really took away from this movie was the unmasking Scan. Do you mean to tell me that Leatherface has no nose thats it...come on. It was at that time a really wanter to see what the guys from "Leatherface: the Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3" where going to do with their unmasking+ Leahterface being a pussy didn't improve the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marcus Nispel's "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is clearly not as good as Tobe Hooper's claustrophobic and disturbing horror classic from 1974.It's still much better than "I Know What You Did Last Summer","Urban Legend" or similar politically correct garbage.The acting is pretty good and there is a nice amount of gore and violence,unfortunately the low-budget nature and intensity of the original are completely gone.The film is fairly predictable and not scary at all.The lack of cannibalism is also hard to forgive.Despite using the cinematographer of the original film,Daniel Pearl,nothing in this remake will scare you or thrill you,unless you're a kid.Still the film is entertaining and has some good atmospheric moments,so if you like horror movies give it a look.6 out of 10.</fullReview>

The cinematography and actions scenes were thrilling, but good scenes kept on getting cut short, leaving the audience members like myself craving more. The film should've been gorier since the first had hardly any blood, and R. Lee Ermey just didn't do it for me, though he's pretty damn good in everything else he does. The young actors involved all did good jobs and there were a few new scenes that made the film even sicker than the first, for example the air stream. Overall, the movie didn't scare me but it did entertain. I hope Tobe's new film coming out will be better than this. As far as horror movies go: 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wretched remake of a wretched movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon having proudly acquired my first VCR back in 1984, one of the first films I rented for it was the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I had heard on more than one occasion that it was one of the best horror films around. I remember that the clerk at the fledgling video store didn't seem to think so and after viewing it myself neither did I. I will admit that the 1974 film did disturb me. It disturbed me that anyone could put such a poorly directed, poorly filmed, poorly acted, poorly scripted, eighty or so minutes on celluloid and release it, let alone have it end up with the cult following it has developed over the years. The best thing about the original was that it kept me from having the desire to see any of it's so called sequels, or to see this 2003 remake. Unfortunately, being a victim of strange circumstances, I ended up in a theater last week viewing this monstrosity as directed by someone called Marcus Nispel. Apparently this is his first feature film so if you're going to make a really awful movie such as this it's best to get it out of the way early in your career.After reading the above, I'm sure you're of the opinion that I had my mind made up before the first scene flickered on the screen. Truthfully, I had hopes that I would be wrong and my $5.75 matinee ticket would not be wasted. Well, the popcorn was fresh and we did get a free refill along with a refill on the soft drink so the day wasn't entirely wasted. The film did have one scene that was well shot and was certainly one I hadn't seen done in this manner before. It comes early in the film and involves a young girl picked up by our cast of usual idiots in a beat up van (led by Jessica Biel and Jonathan Tucker among others)who appears quite disturbed, bloodied, and an all around mess. She wants nothing more than to get the heck out of Dodge, but our stoned traveling companions make the mistake of taking her back to Dodge. It is here that she let's them and us know in no uncertain terms that's not what she wanted. If you see this film, you'll know what I'm talking about, and afterwards you know you can move on with your life because from there on out it's all down hill.R. Lee Ermey is also on hand as the most disgusting sheriff you'd ever want to meet. Of course that fits in with the rest of the film which is nothing more than an exercise in seeing how pointless and distasteful it can become in an hour and a half. Why else make films such as this. I'm sure some people will jump out of their seats at the goings on, how could they not when the audio levels jumps twenty decibals to let us know this is supposed to be the scary part. During one supposedly crucial scene, Leatherface drops his chainsaw as Miss Biels is laying on the floor screaming. It is her opportunity to pick the chainsaw up and take care of business. Instead she just screams louder and longer. It was at this point I looked at my watch and began counting the minutes until I could escape the wretched escapades going on in front of me. When I finally was able to leave, I think I heard the narrators voice say something to the effect that Leatherface had never been found. What that means is the worse horror of all. Another sequel. God help us. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>The "New" Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a lackluster experience, to say the least. Of course, the source material is pretty weak to start with, as I've never been a huge fan of the original, although I've seen it on more than one occasion.In the original, there wasn't much characterization, to say the least. At least the original had the one annoying victim that everyone hopes will get it. In this remake, the 5 hapless youths are all downright annoying, to the point where I WANTED them all dead. This could be an interesting take, if done deliberately, but in the case of this film, I think it's just a case of shoddy scripting.The makers of this dullard of a film should have looked at either the X-Files episode "Home" that featured an killer in-bred hick family to much better effect, both in horror AND humour, not to mention emotion.Maybe they should also looked at House of 1000 Corpses, as it covers basically the same plot territory as TCM, but at least 1000 Corpses knows that the "plot" alone isn't going to carry the day.I really don't see any point in dragging out this review much more, so I'll sum it up this way. This movie would probably be best enjoyed by neophytes of horror film. Real fans of the genre should stay away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*maybe spoilers, but who cares* Even as I write this I have to listen to Robert Palmer just to keep from tearing someone's throat out. This has to be the most ill-conceived film in decades. How could Hollywood forget why they invented remakes? You DO NOT remake a classic. It's a classic for a reason, BECAUSE THEY DID IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME!! The purpose of a remake is to take a film that had potential but did not succeed. The original "Texas" more than succeeds at scaring the various bodily fluids out of you. The dinner scene. Just let that sink in for a minute. They weren't even cannibals in this one! Leatherface. Has. A. F***ing. Name. Yes, I know they called him Bubba in the second one, but that could just be a nickname. Not only that, YOU SEE HIS FACE!! They don't even make a big deal out of it, it just happens. There's just too much. I can't even type. And now they're planning to "reimagine" Christine, Suspiria, The Fog, The Howling, as well as countless others. Why? Why does every good film have to be raped like this. If there is some sort of powerful, all-knowing entity out there, I hope it will see fit to bury this...thing and halt all those other remakes before they have a chance to soil all of time. As has been said many times before: Watch the original. Horror films were not invented in 1996 teeny-boppers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I'd like to start this review off by saying I am indeed a big fan of the original. I loved the grittiness and realism it struck into the horror genre when it came out. It was indeed, original, creative and extremely disturbing. I also would like to say that I'm not a huge fan of the remake idea. I feel if something is so good it should be left alone! I mean how could they ever improve on it! But you must give credit where credit is due and the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre deserves just that. It is without a doubt one of the best films I've ever seen and now my favorite horror film of all time. Bumping the original to 2nd place. You probably think I'm crazy. But this is a completely different film than the original and it bears little resemblance to the original if any. The only true thing it has in common is that both films make no apologies about it's content or the sheer gruesomeness of whats on screen. The original felt like a documentary, it left you feeling disturbed and miserable. This one has gorgeous cinematography courtesy of original cinematographer Daniel Pearl and he gives the film a dark fantasy type quality edged with gloss and stylish refinement. That evokes creepy tingles and the most intense suspense. Everything in this film is so far above average I can't see what they could have done better! The acting is amazing by everyone with one hell of a standout performance by Jessica Biehl whom plays Erin the film's spunky heroine. Although Marilyn Burns is one hell of an amazing actress Jessica Biehl rivals her for showing an explanation of feeling real terror and desperation. Everyone is great and there are just too many to be credited Erica Leerhsen, Eric Balflour, Mike Vogel, R. Lee Emery and etc. And Leatherface is in perfect horrifying form and he's never been scarier. Theres no soft side to him at all he's on the move and is unrelenting and extremely frightening just like the film. I'm a 25 yr. old man and this film had me jumping and even screaming at the screen. I found myself completely involved and even overwhelmed at what was happening. But anyone who pays to go see this movie will get exactly what the title says The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It's that simple and it's the greatest horror film of all time! Jessica Biehl is the new Jamie Lee Curtis and this is her Halloween!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this just this afternoon, and I have to say I am impressed. I'm not going to say it scared me, because not many movies scare me anymore. the real thrill is the jumpy twitch you get from a shock moment. I also find that the music helps a lot with those jumps. That's part of why the old horror movies, from the thirties to forties, are impressive but not so scary to my generation because there is virtually no music to help build tension. I have not seen the original, and now I think I should. The design of the movie is powerful, and really pulls you along. I was getting a little ansy about one particular goof - its Texas, and you see only two guns. Right. I also find it particularly odd that certain characters receive large wounds and don't bleed out, but you never know. There are plenty of sickos in the past who mastered the art of keeping victims alive but inert during torture.Anyhow, I will say I enjoyed it, particularly for the very beginning and end - the black and white old-style video scenes are the most intriguing parts, especially the last one, which is probably the scariest moment. This is not to say that the movie lacked, but because the fashion of the scene, in black and white, makes it seem much more real. And I'm aware that is is modelled on a true story, which I looked into before seeing the movie. While only a few elements are carried over, the movie itself is a particularly intriguing, as a story on its own. (Side note - Film also includes trailer for Resident Evil 2)This movie also reminds me of a particularly effective practical joke - Go to the movie a second time, so you know where certain scenes are. It would be best to go with a friend who hasn't seen it, and try to sit behind them. Then, during the film, you know a particular jumpy scene is approaching....when the music climaxes, and the scene happens, grab your friends shoulder. Havoc will ensue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILERS*Morbid curiosity compelled me to see this. The best thing I can say about this remake is that the victims are more attractive than in the original. I liked the one guy from SIX FEET UNDER, the other guy from THE DEEP END, and especially the third guy - he was a hottie even while hanging from a hook with half a leg missing. Too bad it's always the big-breasted chick who survives the carnage. What's her name? Jessica Biel? Forgive my ignorance about the current crop of Teen People idols; the only thing I remember about her character is that her T-shirt never became untied in the front. Must have been a really tight knot.Wait, that's not exactly true. I do remember something else about her: how utterly stupid she was. Take for example the scene in which the DEEP END guy meets his maker. She's cowering in the corner while Leatherface is fighting him. The chainsaw is spinning on the ground, still operating. Hey, moron! Pick it up and use it!! Stupid girl. Earlier, she just stood there and watched Leatherface hack up the other chick - not screaming in shock or fear, just looking. She wasn't much of a screamer, either; the Sally character in the original had much better lung power.Oh, and another thing, you idiot. When running away from a maniacal killer, it's probably not a good idea to hide in a slaughterhouse with an array of impaling implements at Leatherface's disposal. Common sense is a wondrous thing, y'know. Wouldn't you feel more at home in I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID THAT SUMMER BEFORE THAT OTHER SUMMER?Enough about hacking up young virgins (to quote FRIGHT NIGHT, a movie I was inexplicably reminded of throughout this movie). Never mind how unnecessary this remake is; lemme write about how poor it is. (Comparisons to the original are unavoidable and inevitable, so get over it if you object.) Most noteworthy is this movie's slack editing, which diminishes everything that makes the original a classic. In the original, Leatherface's first kill came out of nowhere, blindsiding both his victim and the audience. No musical portension, no pause in dialogue. Not so in the remake, in which anyone with a lifetime of slasher movies under his belt can predict the moment the killer strikes. What's the point of trying to create scares this way if your audience knows all the tricks?And the best moments from the original are gone. When I saw that one of the chicks was wearing a backless blouse, I was anticipating a replay of that fantastic shot in the original of her walking up to the house, with the camera gliding behind her under the swing. Alas, I later noticed there was no swing at the house. Damn. And the best sequence from the original - the shocking dinner scene with the extreme close-up of the terrified eye - was nowhere to be found. I wasn't asking for a PSYCHO-esque shot-by-shot remake ('cause we all know how *that* turned out), but why omit the most memorable bits from a remake? Adding buckets of gore and general mayhem is not the answer.Other points. I wondered where all the smoke in the air was coming from, just like I wondered what was backlighting the house. I scoffed when a shot of a full moon in a clear sky was soon followed by a torrential downpour. Wondered about the significance of the photos in the mason jar: who put them in there and then in the rusted car, and why. Pondered R. Lee Ermey's career, since he always seems to be playing variations of the same unpleasant character. Questioned why the hitchhiker did what she did at that particular moment. (What, she wanted an audience?) And, how did the kids' van get to the house with its wheels fallen off? And how did they fall off in the first place? And, whose baby was that anyway, and how was he sneaked out of the diner without anyone noticing?And I also wondered how Leatherface started his chainsaw with one arm missing, but I convinced myself it was an homage to EVIL DEAD II.Ebert is right with nearly all of his complaints. This remake, once it gets down to business, is simply a collection of gruesome scenes that can be shown in basically any order. There is no narrative thrust, no connection from point A to B, no emotional investment in the story or the characters.When I heard of a Michael-Bay-produced remake of arguably the best horror movie ever, I first took it as another sign of the Apocalypse. But I calmed down after seeing the promising trailer. I mean, this had to be better than Part II and the awful McConaughey/Zellweger "Return." And, I suppose, it is, but that's like saying Part III is the worst GODFATHER (the competition is weak). An attractive cast really did help this movie (in a completely shallow way, of course).Generally, I have nothing against a remake if it succeeds in re-imagining and modernizing the original concept to the benefit of the current audience (CAPE FEAR comes to mind). But this movie is not updated in any relevant way. It's even set during the same time as the original, so I ask again, what's the point?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well folks, I've seen most of the movies that claim to be the "scariest ever". The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, The Shining, (which I considered tame to begin with) can't hold a torch next to the remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This movie was absolutely terrifying, creepy, graphic, disturbing, everything a horror movie should be. The original was mildly creepy, but this one just takes the cake. The cinematography is excellent (very rare for a horror film) especally the scene where the hitchhiker... well, you know..... I highly recommend this to anyone who isn't easily unsettled by today's typical horror movies. This one will go down as being 10000 times better then the original, and possibly one of the most frightening films of all time. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Worthless Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw no need to remake a horror classic like Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The original is truly horrifying and I couldn't imagine a need to change it. But the previews of this new version made me think it was worth checking out. Big mistake. The original showed how truly horrific this experience was for the victims. This remake seemed more like an adventure for bored teens. The stupid dialog, especially the Sheriff's was just hysterical. There was nothing scary about him at all. He was ludicrous and funny. So much for horror. Why today's directors want to turn the horror genre into Comedy Central fodder is just a mystery. We go to horror movies to be terrorized, not to laugh. The characters in this movie didn't merit sympathy, they were just annoying know-it-alls that were all expendable. You want to see a true horror movie, stick to the original. You want to see a pile of garbage put out for no other reason than to profit off of a classic, then this new version is for you.Shameless money grab. Nothing more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Horror" gloss for those who don't want to be scared that much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw the original in the aftermath of the video nasty furore, and while I can see the impact of the film on the horror canon I never held the film as a scared cow. So I was curious to see what they would do with the remake. Oh dear!Hollywood doesn't make scary films anymore, let alone horrific ones. The criticism that horror films are only made for an audience that shouldn't even be allowed to see such films is borne out by this remake. The special effects of blood letting is now all consuming. But without tone and intensity, to say nothing of characterization the whole film fails to scare. It's only in comparison to the original you see how the remake lacks the pacing, tone and intensity required to build the tension, solely relying on cheap and easy jumps. Despite its heritage this film is just another quick edit recycling with "beautiful" people and no heart a la Scream or countless other "horror" films made for the pubescent marketplace.It's also interesting to note that this is safe horror. The child is rescued at the end and as per usual the heroine not only survives but has her superwoman moments. The supposedly unstoppable Leatherface has his arm cut off and the sheriff is run over. So it's a horror film but don't worry we won't scare you that much and we will follow all the predicable trends.For those who would say that my comments about the heroine are sexist and even misogynistic. Please don't be so myopic and naive. I watch horror to be shocked, surprised and yes I'll admit it, horrified. You can't be surprised if you know that certain characters and events are preordained on the basis of a pound of flesh owed by some very exploitative films in the 70's and 80's. It doesn't redress the balance. It just makes for very tired and predicable film making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike many horror fans I never cared much for the original "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", so I wasn't exactly excited about it being remade with "Seventh Heaven"-star Jessica Biel. Anyway, a friend called one night and we decided to go and watch a horror flick at the theatrs - and they happened to show the remake of "TCM". Little did we know what we were in for.This movie is a torture and I mean that in a positive way. This is horror in its purest form. No jokes, no sex and almost no story at all. Just a killing spree. Whereas the deaths in the "Final Destination"-movies were so over the top that they were funny, TCM's only intention is to freak you out. I would never have thought that a straight forward slasher-flick can be so effective. The Friday The 13th and Halloween franchises, as much as I love them, were always more funny than scary. The sound of Leatherface's chainsaw as he hunts his victims down relentlessly (and somewhat clumsily), however, is really nerve-racking. As a reviewer at bloody-disgusting.com said so appropriately, in the final 30 minutes this movie is like someone tickling you to death. You just wish it would stop already, because you don't think you can take any more. (I read something else at bloody-disgusting, which I find pretty hard to believe: Michael Bay, producer of this ultra-violent, flick sits on the Committee of Directors Against Violence... You're doing a good job, Michael!)Anyway, of course this movie has its bad sides, too. SPOILERS: I reckon, if someone cuts your leg off and puts you on a meat hook you either can't stop screaming or you faint immediately before you DIE! Why wouldn't this guy scream or faint or die? Also, the movie had too much plot at the end. What was the stolen baby good for? And why was this one member of the family, the kid, so helpful? Didn't make sense to me. END OF SPOILERS.In the end Marcus Nispel managed to make a movie superior to the original, much like Gore Verbinski's "The Ring", but not quite as good. New Line, I salute you for giving us so many kick-ass horror movies, full of violence and gore, lately.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an avid fan of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre series I was really stoked when I heard they were doing a re-make. I was also really concerned that they were going to do a terrible job.I am so glad I was wrong. There is a bit of obligatory young adult road-trip dialogue at the beginning, but as soon as they break down, it's on like Donkey Kong. This movie is brutal. It's full of graphic suspenseful scenes that most often in an all out gore fest.This movie absolutely does justice to the original and in my opinion should be considered a benchmark in horror. If I could rate it higher than 10 I would.Must watch material for any true TCM fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good remake that the world did not need</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Read the summary and that's about the gist of it. They did some nice things here, I especially like the scenes of the police going through the house inspecting the aftermath as the film starts. I think that's a nice opening.Jessica Beil plays a nice scream queen, though it does slightly hurt the film to have such a well known actress in the lead film (even in 2003 she was quite well known). Part of the appeal of the original was the performances were so gritty and grounded, having a star takes that away slightly. A lot of the original horror scenes are reused with updated effects and the characters swapping around a bit. In some ways I think the sheriff in this film is a more effective villain than we see in the first film.Leatherface seems to be a cross between the character he played in later Chainsaw movies and the character from the first one, which doesn't quite work. The attack at the very end does not have the impact they were hoping for.They actually invited back Daniel Pearl, the cinematographer from the the original 1973 film to create the same feel and look as the original and he certainly succeeds. As far as direction, I especially like the scene where the camera zooms through a hole a woman has just put into her head with a shot gun. While some of the dialogue is a little silly, we do have a strong horror script. The scene where a guy is hung up on a hook and tries to push his way off, only to fall back on is about as grisly as a film can get.In the end this is quality survival horror, but didn't need to use the TCM name. Could have cut a few of the similarities, kept the same cast and gore and got far better reviews.Little bit of sex scene in this one, but can't remember any graphic nudity. Lots of blood and guts. Fine film, but probably needs to be seen before you see the original, which is the superior film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jessica Biel, R. Lee Ermey and Andrew Bryniarski star in this 2003 horror remake of Tobe Hooper's 1974 film. On a summer day in 1973, Erin (Biel) and her friends are driving through Texas on their way to a concert in Mexico. They almost hit a girl and learn she's been through hell. She tells them not to go further and they'll die if they do. After she kills herself in their van, they go to an old house down the road owned by the Hewitts and call for help. Erin and her friends are terrorized by chainsaw-wielding killer, Leatherface (Bryniarski) and his psychotic, cannibalistic family led by Sheriff Hoyt (Ermey). Soon, Erin becomes the only survivor fighting for her life. Though the original is superior, this is a pretty good remake with a good cast I recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worse, but More Horrific, than the Original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>August, 1973. Five friends - Erin (Jessica Biel), Morgan, (Jonathon Tucker), Pepper (Erica Leerhsen), Andy (Mike Vogal) and Kemper (Eric Balfour) - drive through Texas on their way to a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert. Along the way they pick up a woman (Lauren German) that they find listlessly walking along the road. As they enter a small, dead-looking town, the woman panics and shoots herself. They stop in order to notify the authorities, but are picked off one by one by a family of murderous cannibals."The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (2003) is the perfect compliment to "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) in that where the first fails, the second succeeds (the reverse it likewise true). While the original is certainly the better film, the remake is just as assuredly the better horror film. Its style much better conforms with contemporary genre expectations than its predecessor. It features significantly higher levels of gore, much more low-key lighting and a subdued color palette in general. The decision to have the hitchhiker be a victim of the family (instead of a member of it) as well as the active psychological terror on the part of the sheriff (R. Lee Ermey) heightened the terror and unease of the film.The trade off, however, is the loss of 1) the brilliant juxtaposition between the protagonists' surroundings (idyllic, brightly-lit sunflowers) and the horrific violence of the family, 2) the foreshadowing of the protagonists' "butchering" at the hands of the family through the images of the livestock and slaughterhouse, 3) the social commentary on industrial modernization.Fans of modern slasher movies as well as the original film (or at least the idea of it) will find this a fitting and entertaining film. The more critically-minded viewer, however, will likely find it more than a little over-the-top and less satisfying than its predecessor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never saw the original. It was heavily banned in UK cinemas when it first came out and, by the time it was easily accessible, I had got past the point where I was interested in seeing it. So I came to this remake on its own merits, as a work of fiction though based on a real-life atrocity way back when.In any event, the title kind of gives the game away. In Texas, some people get massacred with a chainsaw. I kind of knew what I was in for. And that's exactly what I got - a lot of gory effects, a lot of suspense, and a "Does anybody make it out alive, and if so who and how?" hook to hold the audience's investment.There are at least a couple of names in the cast here - the always entertaining R Lee Ermey, and Jessica Biel near the start of her career - as opposed to the cast of Tobe Hooper's original who have pretty much retained the anonymity they started off with.This film does exactly what it sets out to do - no more, no less - but is helped by good performances and convincing effects/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was excepting a remarkable movie, and I got a average film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm disappointed. I really am. I've been hearing about this movie for years, and people always said to me that it was one of best horror movies that they had ever seen. I'm not saying that is terrible, it's just not great. First off, it's boring and dull. It's same history, we have hear of it. A random guy goes off and kills a group of people, one by one, in different and horrifying ways. But if I have to blame the remake for this aspect, I have to blame the original too. You spend more time watching a girl screaming and running than actually getting to see a developing process on the story line. It's not scary, there are just some parts that make jump of your seat because the killer comes out of the nowhere, but people got to remember that doesn't automatically make a horror movie scary, that HELPS making a horror movie scary! I think that some characters behavior is very inconstant, specially Pipper, in a minute she only cares about doing the right thing by leaving a corpse to the police, and in the other moment they're ready to get in the van and leave their friend behind just to go to a concert. And another thing. The story is set on 1973, but their language and their clothes are from 2000. But hold on, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has some good aspects too. Some of the character are really well built and well done, like Leatherface, because you can easily understand his motivation, at some point, I don't know if I'm the only, but you kind of feel sorry for him. The dialogue is average, it's not amazing but it's not awful either. The acting it's good, same goes for the visual effects. A lot of people complain about the superfluous gore, it actually doesn't bother me, I think it's a characteristic aspect about this movie, and I could honestly say that it makes it more entertaining for people like me. Overall it's not a lousy movie, but it isn't has good as it's painted. I wouldn't watched it's easily forgotten and I wouldn't recommend it to people as something that you necessarily need to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing too special, but a good movie none-the-less.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard that there was going to be a re-make of this classic horror, I felt extremely excited and inpatient to watch this film. Perhaps I had my hopes set too high for this movie, because there were a couple of scary and jumpy moments, but it was all so predictable and massively cliché'd.There were several good points about this movie; first of all the acting. Each character, mainly Jessica Biel and The Sheriff, gain and sustain a good authentic character which one can clearly see throughout this movie. Also, the story-line,(although a little predictable) was good.However, the main thing that disappointed me was how stupid the characters set out to be. I found myself yelling at my T.V more than once; for instance, when Jessica Biel (little spoiler coming up people) chopped Leatherface's arm off and ran, she really could have picked up the chainsaw and finished the job. There are several other times, but I will let you decide what parts frustrate you. Moreover, every little thing is so predictable. The survivors fall over when they're running away, they fall and hurt their ankle, which happens in EVERY single Horror movie. There are also a lot of other times where you just know what's going to happen, but I will not bore you further.To sum it all up, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a good film to watch if you want a good horror with a scary villain, and should give you some scares and jumps. However, with more effort and enthusiasm from the producers and directors, this movie can do better. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a TCM remake starts off with Sweet Home Alabama, you tend to sit up a bit more straight. That's exactly what happened to me. I didn't want no nu-metal soundtrack while Leatherface is going all insane with his saw.Jessica Beil was surprisingly decent (I mean, I like her but I never thought she could do a film like TCM). The Sawyer Family, is still amazing but the remakes lack the little humor-bites from a characters like Chop Top, from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2.The TCM series started off with some good humor and it is that humor that is missing from the remakes. The film is an amazing individual film, with gritty suspense and a reasonable amount of bloodshed but however, when compared to the first two TCM films, there is a definite lack of some of that classic black humor, something to put light on the degree of insanity of that family and that is something that is shown in this film only through seriousness and terror.However, I finished the movie with a smile on my face and I'm sure I can watch this film a few more times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) is a remake of the 1974 classic directed by Tobe Hopper. I've never been blessed to watch the full original (DVD stopped before they even met Leatherface) so I;m basing this review on the film itself.The film starts off with police footage of a crime scene walk through. They brought the original voice, which I was pleased about. Then it goes on to the five main kids led by Erin (Jessica Biel) and her friends Kemper, Andy, Morgan and a hitchhiker they picked up, Pepper. They are on their way from Mexico to go to a Skynard (sp) concert. They find a young girl walking down the road dazed, confused, and scared. When they pick her up, she shoots herself in the head. They go to look for the police only to stumble upon the Hewitt house, were the horror lives.The first 40 or so minuetes of this film are character building, and it works. I left caring about all the characters that got killed and was rooting for Erin to live.The deaths weren't gory, but they are still gruesome. Kemper gets hit over the head with a sledge hammer and then dragged to the basement by Leatherface. His face is then cut off. Andy gets chased by Leatherface and gets his leg sawed off and then later on Erin kills him to end his pain. Pepper is killed with the chainsaw but it is not seen but leaves all the gore to the viewer and is frightening. Morgan gets killed with the chainsaw in the stomach.The suspense is very high in this film. Since all of the characters are likable you don't know which are going to survive. I did know that Erin was going to survive though. The whole film is one chase scene and the ones with Jessica Biel at the end are heart-pounding. (It also doesn't hurt that she is easy on the eyes).The performances by everyone, mostly R. Lee Ermey and Jessica Biel, are amazing. Everyone knows their character and knows how to portray them the right way.Over all this movie is scary. It has suspense and gore and truly is one of my favorites. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake does what it"s meant to do: gross you out and scare you sh!tless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary for all the wrong reasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never watched the original Texas Chainsaw massacre and never got to watch the remake on DVD until recently(guess what, i think both are banned by the government here in my country. So, thank you ebay), hence i can't do a comparison.Story in this remake revolves around a retelling of "actual" events involving a group of teenagers and their tragic run-in with a deranged Texan family of killers and the murderous Leatherface. In true slasher movie fashion, the characters are just there to look pretty until they get offed one by one in the most gruesome ways. The acting is better than the usual B grade horror film but it suffered from an uninspired script and flat story.As a stand alone horror movie, this Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake is actually more horrific than horror. It does not scare by actually scaring but by making the audience cringe in terror thanks to gratuitous amounts of gore and prolonged scenes of suffering before the eventual death(that scene where Leatherface rubs salt into the broken stump of a leg of one of the characters(still alive, mind you) before wrapping it in paper like a Christmas ham. Many times, the film leaves the genre of horror and falls into more a "torture porn"-like genre.In fact the kills come across more like action scenes and not scary scenes.If there was anything scary about the film, it was not leather-face. Rather, it was the overall sense of helplessness felt by the main characters. As the movie goes along, the characters try to turn to other townsfolk for help. But they soon realize that the townsfolk, and even the sheriff, are not only unwilling to help, but have a much darker agenda planned. I have been flipping through Marcus Nispel's short resume of films(he directed the Friday the 13th remake and Pathfinder) and Platinum dune's list of horror remakes and i realize that a trend for them is to sideline everything else, be it an interesting story or engaging characters, and focus solely on gory killings. At least the film looks great with a stylishly worn yellowish tinge to every scene that complements the "1970s" setting. THAT is also the other thing that is scary about this movie. How could a movie with a boring story, bland characters and over the top blood-letting get so popular and earn such a profit at the box office?? If this is the future of slasher movies, I AM TERRIFIED. Texas Chainsaw Massacre exists solely for escapism or to gross out some of your more chicken-hearted friends. It is a cringe worthy thrill ride of a splatter-fest but with little else to offer. Not the best of horror movie remakes, but not the worst either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sue me, I love this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years, I have grown more and more fond of this Texas Chainsaw remake. Going into it back in 2003, I had never seen the original (I have since checked it out) nor did I know anything about it other than it looked to be a creepy horror movie. I wasn't disappointed then, and I've grown to love it now. I've found myself basing other horror movies against this one because I simply enjoy this one so much. I know the original is a "classic" but this remake takes some ideas from the original and simply tells it better. I love the unsettling characters, the off-putting setting, and the gruesome unapologetic killings. This falls victim to a few horror clichés, but in the end, this is what a horror movie should be, whether it be a remake or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where does Hollywood get these stupid people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the original TTCM and it was one of the few movies that scared the hell out of me. I felt sympathy for the characters (who were a hell of a lot more likable than these idiot). There was also a realistic feel to it, which this remake lacks. In the original the characters are checking out their grandpa's grave after hearing reports of grave robing. In this one their on their way to a Lenard skinard concert; and in my opinion: That's lazy writing! The characters in the remake in my opinion were a bunch of low life morons who went right into the trap themselves. I'll admit, i did fear for Morgan who just wanted to get out of there.I usually don't like rooting for villains, but these people make really hard. The killers have the best dialouge, which made me like them the best. I loved Lee Erny and i also feared for his character, and was angry when he got ran over at the end.The biggest reason this movie doesn't work is Jessica Beils character. I hated her, and was rooting for leatherface to kill her throughout.The film doesn't even have a dinner scene; how do you even call this a remake. Also a lot of the violence in this movie is complete BS. There's no way you can cut somebodies arm off with a meat cleaver with a blade that's obviously been daul for who knows how long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary and Chilling!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would give this film, ten stars, but no film is perfect. However, this film is very very close to perfection! The Texas Chainsaw Massacre scared me right away, as I am sure it did most people watching in the audience. No other film, horror film that is, has scared me from the start, as effectively as this movie did. Not just in the beginning, but throughout, this horror film really gets to you. The Leatherface character, is truly terrifying when you see him appear in front of the camera!! The first scene, of which leatherface comes out, it gave me the chills, like I have never felt or experienced before. Like I said before, no other movie, has ever moved me in such a way that The Texas Chainsaw Massacre did. There was never a dull moment, when watching this film. In all honesty, I can say there was not one scene, in which I can say I was bored, or I thought to myself, this is boring, I am leaving. No No, very very active and suspenseful, and the end, was the best part of all. I wont reveal what happens, but it shook me too the core of my very being. People, reading this.. Go out and rent The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you will be thrilled you did!! By the way, I hope the people making and producing the Texas Chainsaw films, will keep at it, they are doing great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It did well to make a remake worth your time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It wasn't really shot the unique way as the original was in the 70's (That being a Documentary-like picture and shooting) but its transformation to a horror movie was pretty good. It offers a few jumps here and there but nonetheless is predictable. However this one focuses more on Leatherface so if your up for more action, gore, and death scenes then the original I highly recommend you look into this one. I think the move was worth the time and keeps you interested. I think some people highly underestimate this flick and make it looks way worse then it is. I believe it is not bad at all. The Hewitt family is brutal (But slightly more sane then the one we see in the original) and as is Leatherface. But the action in this one is worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Old Horror Thriller Delivers The Goods</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a stunning piece of horror flick with plenty of gore and violence. The story revolved around 5 friends who bumped into a lady on the road and offered her a ride. That was certainly a wrong decision on their part as this had started a string of havocs and nightmares after that. Apparently the girl was a tortured soul both mentally and physically and blew her own head up with a gun inside the vehicle the group was traveling in. Shaken up and petrified, the group of friends don't know what to do with the dead body. They eventually decided to report the case to the sheriff. The nightmare began at that stage.Apparently the sheriff was a fake and was in the same family as the "Madman" with the chainsaw. Two of the group members eventually found out the place where the "Madman" was hiding and one of them got captured and kept in the basement. The others then went to look for him and one by one got captured and brutally killed. The way the killings were done was exceptionally brutal as the victims were subjected to some cruel punishing which include having the skin of the face scrapped off, the body hanged using steel hooks, the outer skin of the face cut out, legs sliced clean and body cut into half. At the end of the day, one of the member of the group come out victorious(damn I thought she wouldn't have survived the onslaught of the crazy Madman with the huge chainsaw).This film is definitely not for the faint-hearted as it contains a lot of violent and gore elements done in a tasteful way and not like some cheap crappy productions.Highly recommended for mature audiences seeking for some high-quality thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is no skin off anybody's nose when compared to the original or some of its clones.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When director Tim Burton of "Beetlejuice" fame decided to remake "Planet of the Apes" in 2001, Hollywood added a new word to its lexicon: 'reimage.' Basically, Burton didn't so much remake "Apes" as he 'reimaged' the 1968 Charlton Heston sci-fi classic. Now, those same Hollywood spin doctors have applied this jargon to the new remake of the 1974 Tobe Hooper horror cult classic "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre." As produced by "Pearl Harbor" director Michael Bay and helmed by music video director Marcus Nispel, the new "The Texas Chainsaws Massacre" certainly qualifies more as a 'reimagination' rather than a remake. Meaning, if you loved the original "Chainsaw," you will probably loathe this atmospherically-lensed reimagination with its hot, sexy cast of victims from the WB Network.The squeamish should shy away from the new "TCM" if they cannot stomach disturbing images of death, dismemberment, mutilation, and suicide. Meanwhile, gorehounds galore and horror film purists may want to pass up this lavishly produced California-style version of the lean, mean, shoestring-budgeted, independent Texas film classic. The new "TCM" lacks virtually everything that made Hooper's version so gripping, gut-wrenching, and nightmarish. In fact, Hooper limited his participation in the new "TCM" to agreeing to let Bay and his production company, Platinum Dunes, 'reimage' the legendary chiller. Gory by its own R-rated standards, the new "TCM" tries to fix a classic that was never broken in the first place. The three lesser known sequel/remakes that followed the original "Chainsaw" relied the same tactics Bay, Nispel and freshman scenarist Scott Kosar indulge in here with shades of success. Indeed, "TCM" will frighten the frijoles out of you if you find terror an intolerable part of your cinematic diet.Unfortunately, "TCM" conjures up ideas and elements that have little to do with the original, so calling it a 'reimagination' properly classifies this creepy but cretinous remake. Moreover, like the "Chainsaw" sequels, other characters upstage the villainous Leatherface, a sadistic serial slayer who carves up folks with a chainsaw and stitches together their severed body parts for his own amusement. True, all "Chainsaw" movies loosely trace their origins back to the infamous 1957 case of cannibalistic Ed Gein, who also served as the basis for Alfred Hitchcock's notorious 1961 classic "Psycho," However, evil Ed never brandished a chainsaw, though he did make suits from the flesh of the women he skinned.The new "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" opens as a quintet of teenagers in a van come cruising back from Mexico to attend a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert in Dallas. While they were below the border, they bought enough marihuana to pack it into a pi?ata. As they tool along a dusty back road, they nearly collide with a woebegone-looking girl walking in an apparent trance. Erin (T-shirt-clad Jessica Biel of TV's "7th Heaven") gets her boyfriend Kemper (Ben Affleck look-a-like Eric Balfour of TV's "Six Feet Under") to stop, while Pepper (Erica Leerhsen of "Blair Witch 2) and she persuade this destitute teen (Lauren German of "A Walk To Remember") to ride with them. No sooner has this girl climbed into the van than she surprises everybody by committing suicide. The special effect of a bullet blowing out the back of her skull as well as shattering the rear window of the van ranks as the best shot in the entire film. Anti-climactic best describes the rest of "TCM," because nothing surpasses this graphic moment, not even when Leatherface chainsaws off another teen's leg. Anyway, these shocked teens drive into a one-horse town and ask for the sheriff. Sheriff Hoyt (the incomparable R. Lee Emery of "Full Metal Jacket") agrees to meet them elsewhere, so while they wait at the rendezvous for the lawman, the teenagers wander around in the woods. Erin and Kemper discover a big dilapidated house with columns and run afoul of old Monty (Terrence Evans of "Terminator 2") a scumbag in a wheel chair with no legs who lets Erin use their phone, but forces Kemper to wait outside. After waiting longer than he wants, an impatient Kemper decides to enter the house, only to be assaulted by Leatherface (Andrew Bryniarski of "Black Mask 2") and dragged against his will into another part of the house. Imagine a bad night in the emergency room and your imagination might be able to prepare you for the carnage that follows.Aside from the superb opening special effects gimmick, the best thing about this reimagination of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is Daniel Pearl's first-rate cinematography. Incidentally, Pearl earned his first credit as cinematographer working on none other than Tobe Hooper's "Texas Chainsaw Massacre!" Art director Scott Gallagher and set decorator Randy Huke deserve mention for their outstanding work. Sadly, aside from a good cast, with R. Lee Emery stealing every scene he appears in as a sleazy, no-account badge-totter, "TCM" boasts little that sticks in the memory. Director Marcus Nispel refrains from humor, except when ghoulish R. Lee Emery isn't chewing the scenery with his vile observations. Unlike Tobe Hooper's "Chainsaw," which cost $150-thousand and coined over a $100 million, "TCM" never drums up the eerie sensations that the threadbare "Chainsaw" did. On the original "Chainsaw," Hooper depicted the murders without the heaping blood and gore that brought to his own 1986 sequel, "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2." Nispel piles on as much blood and gore as his R-rating allows, but this kind of horror flick has been done so many times before and done better, as Rob Zombie did with "House of 1000 Corpses," that it makes little impression. Altogether, "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is no skin off anybody's nose when compared to the original or some of the more memorable clones of the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Again... why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of horror movies and mostly ORIGINAL horror movies, I have to wonder the reason WHY they keep remaking these classic movies? And it's not like this movie was tired or 'too old school.' The original "Texas Chain Saw Massacre" still creeps people out plenty and, judging by the rating on this website, people still dig.It's not that this remake was poorly done, it wasn't. The gore was good, the scares were aplenty, and R. Lee Ermey was really creepy, but they cheesed it up with the stupid, tired, 'goofy college kids getting hacked up' routine. The characters are no different than those in every other modern horror movie out there and it's so BORING.By all means: keep making these nu-horror torture-fests but STOP NAMING THEM AFTER CLASSICS IN A SORRY ATTEMPT TO CASH IN ON A REAL FILM! We didn't forget how cool the original was and still IS and we don't need you morons messing them up.I'd be fine with this film if it wasn't called "Texas Chainsaw Massacre." Call it something else, cuz it can't touch the original.3 out of 10, kids.</fullReview>

It's so funny to analyze this movie, you will realize how extremely bad it actually is. The reason I'm still giving it a sufficient is, in my eyes, obvious.

		<shortDescription>The blueprint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Texas Chainsaw Massacre is the blueprint for the backwoods horror flick. Made in the early 1970s on an ultra low budget, TCM ripped into theaters and immediately caused a stir. The Reason? There had never really been anything quite like it. Granted, Psycho beat it to the punch, yet even Psycho was restrained in a way in which TCM refused to be. The set piece for Hitchcock's classic was one scene of violence, whereas Hooper chose to show of several scenes that suggested violence but never explicitly showed it. Indeed, fans claim to see much gore on show in TCM yet there is really only one scene of such. That comes when Leatherface accidentally chainsaw's his own leg. Other scenes never actually show gore, but are edited in such a way as the viewer pieces in the nasty details themselves. The meathook scene is a prime example. We see the girl lifted up towards the meathook and we see her hanging from it, but we never see it impale her. Yet many have claimed that this is a part of the film. Its all about how Tobe Hooper edited the film to make it shocking. In the end, TCM is a classic because of what it did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For a Chainsaw Movie... There was a lack of REAL Gore...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you look at the Texas Chainsaw massacre ripped down to it's skeleton. It is a very flimsly premise, even the original was a bit weak in the actual story department, The original at least could hold it's own in the shock factor. The oldie had me jump a few times. Of course with this installment, the entire movie is about cheap shock value. That and the suffering in particular of Morgan and Andy. Morgan had my sympathy throughout his entire ordeal which when you see it, will make you very uncomfortable. If anything Leatherface plays a side role in this movie, appearing in sewing scenes and putting a handful of salt on a certain someone's open wounds.The families that hang around making hell for the teens are missing one simple thing that fuelled the entire original Story. They were Cannibals. The newer movie seems fit to leave this fact out completely and ignore it. Which literally makes little to no sense to me. Despite some obvious flaws and some boring camera angles, this movie gets gory very fast but there is only one big gross out you will see, and that's it. For a movie about a chainsaw wielding, skin wearing, freak a zoid, there felt like a lapse of any REAL violence. Most is just the facial expressions of the teens as they are ripped into little bits.Don't avoid the movie but if at all possible see the older version. It will be much better than this. This remake is not terrible and it makes for a good movie to watch if you're bored. Otherwise... well. It's up to you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When movies are remade, they should be almost EXACTLY like the original and this movie isn't even close. In the original, the characters are going to grandpa's house. In this movie, they are returning from Mexico. In the original, they pick up a crazy hitchhiker who cuts himself but in this movie they pick up a whiny girl who I really don't have any sympathy for.This movie is also missing Franklin and that is sad. Franklin made the movie great and not having him in it really made me mad. Having Franklin in it also brought some humor because he was spitting and whining and I thought that was funny. Then there is an old lady in this new version and a little kid who were not in the original. The characters in the van don't even have the same names.There is also an old guy on a toilet. Gross. I think it should have been made more similar and I could go on with more comparisons but I think that I will get out my chainsaw and saw the new version in half.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not seen the original "Texas Chainsaw Massacre". That is I think a fair ground to base a review on. The story of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is simple and lacks creativity and originality. The movie is not done badly but is really nothing special.The plot is, as I said, really simple: A group of teenagers, including too-hot-to-die Jessica Biel, is riding in a car as a girl that they picked up somewhere shoots herself in the head when she discovers that they are taking her back to the place she just escaped from. They drive to the next gas station or something to call the police and report the suicide. The village they are in turns out to be inhabited only by bizarre freaks among which is a guy, Leatherface, who wears masks made off human skin and tries to kill everyone with a chainsaw. Really nothing new but "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" has its scary moments.Before I watched this movie I didn't know why anyone thought Jessica Biel was all that great. But I understood right in her first scene why everyone does. She is really beautiful and a surprisingly talented actress and if her character died in the beginning, I would have quit watching this film because really she is the best thing about this movie. It quickly becomes clear though that she won't die. Her character is that of a cute, moral, good girl...really unrealistic and so likable and perfect that it is already annoying. It is however her moral behavior that in some way leads to the deaths of her friends. It's her who wants to pick up the confused girl and wait for the sheriff. That leads to the encounters with Leatherface and his friends. She is the one responsible that the group ever ends up in that bizarre town and she is the only one of them who ever leaves it alive but not before she killed about the same amount of people as Leatherface...(unintentional) irony?!...decide yourself.Anyway, some tense scenes and scary moments make this a watchable film. But even more do Jessica Biel's looks and her performance.** 5/10 **</fullReview>

No, I'm not a wuss, I just got bored and desensitized with it halfway through, and wanted to see everybody just die and have it be done with already. The final scene was long and drawn out...how long can a chase scene really last?! Well in this movie, I guess two thirds of the entire movie is sufficient.

		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, one of the most iconic horror movies ever and they dare to remake it? Yes of course they do this is Hollywood and make no mistake if there's a way to get cash in its back pocket it will do and here was the way of doing it.The story is about a group of people traveling who find themselves getting into a situation when they pick up a hitchhiker, after the hitchhiker kills them self the group from that point on find themselves in a situation where they are sliced, diced and chased with a chainsaw.All sounds good and believe it or not it is, the film for the most part has everything going for it, of course we have the attractive cast and we have the killer as good as he could ever be and we have the beautiful cinematography which gives the film the unique chance of being as good as its original.Although as you go through the film you may find yourself saying this is in no way as good as the original, but the film does come close in terms of how the film looks and the way it acts, for example the end scenes in the meat factory are just shot in such a raw way you find yourself really thinking that this indeed could be based on a true story (which of course it isn't) The direction is strong in places and lacking in others but you can really see where the strong direction is as it comes out in so obvious doses.The acting in this film is probably no different to what you've seen before in your typical hack and slash film and so don't be surprised if you find yourself thinking at points i remember a character like this is that horror film. The downside of the acting is that you never really care for them because there is no real for you to do so. The best piece of acting comes from R Lee Emery who plays Sheriff Hoyt, this character at times feels more like the main villain of the piece and he is just so interesting to watch that the whole film could just be about him because he pulls the character off with so much style and so much interest definitely the best acting in the film without question! Of course we cant forget the real reason why anyone wants to watch this film and that is of course to see Leatherface who in this film feels in my opinion much more of a character much more realistic and i think this more humanized character is much more interesting to watch and observe on screen rather than just a monster. The direction towards Leatherface is really strong and is one of the obvious strong direction points of the film.The film does have weaknesses, the main being that the film will always be compared to the original TCM movie and more often than not people will agree and say the original was better but i think this film deserves credit for it's unique look and gritty style which is what a film of this horror caliber needed and because of that i think this film deserves some credit, this is certainly a remake that should definitely have failed on every count considering the original but this is certainly isn't a remake that should be ignored, rather it should be embraced! Not by any means as good as the original but certainly a great effort all round roll on Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning.****** out of **********</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before anything else let me inform you that I have NOT SEEN the original TCM but I am well aware of the cult status the film enjoys.That being said lets all forget everything we know about the movie but the Star Cast of the film.(plastered on the cover of the DVD and all over this site so even if you are one of those who don't like to know anything about the movie before you see this you have to know who stars in it....). QUICK ONE GUESS DO YOU THINK ANYONE SURVIVES AT THE END OF THE FILM IF YES THEN WHO...???. Trust me 99.99% of you have got it right......ALREADY.The first five minutes of the film will ensure that all if any mystery that is left the movie is revealed.So basically you spend the rest of the movie knowing exactly what is going to happen , when and how .....Even if you don't want to guess whats going to happen next, sooner or later you will realise that the movie is soo predictable, that it almost makes no sense seeing it.Technically though this movie is very very good (but tell me can you name a single movie with a decent budget that is not ?). However this movie is better that most.The scenes are brutal, the claustrophobic confines actually make you feel suffocated, the various emotions of the actors are actually felt by you, the makeup is great...etc etc etc...The acting and casting is perfect each and every character looks and plays his part perfectly R. Lee Ermey as Sheriff Hoyt especially was too good and clearly stole the show for me.Jessica Biel served as some good eye candy as well and throughout the movie we were served sometimes gratifying, and sometimes distracting shots of her rear, her wet t-shirt etc.The plot inconsistencies are also glaring while at one end the movie makers got the time it takes for a person who has grievous injuries to die right (yup people take a long time to die), on the other we have a girl displaying a feat of strength that the strongest body builders would kill to have.Clearly the filmmakers spent so much time on perfecting the technical aspects of the film that they forgot that the script is the backbone of the film and its very very difficult to pull off a film only on the basis of visual brilliance.Also the cult status of the film will clearly draw comparisons to the original which brings us to the other flaw.This movie is a completely unnecessary remake, the only reason I believe that a remake should ever be made is when the makers have something new to add to the original or wish to use modern tools such as computer animation to enhance the original film.This movie clearly fails on both counts.An unnecessary remake which is technically sound but with a highly flawed and UTTERLY PREDICTABLE SCRIPT.If you want to watch the movie then I still recommend you watch (OR REWATCH) the original.(WHILE I'm WRITING THIS MY FRIEND WHO HAS WATCHED THE ORIGINAL HAS CONFIRMED EVERYTHING I HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE ORIGINAL AND ITS COMPARISON WITH THIS FILM).-S Highly predictable, glaring inconsistencies in the plot and script, boring.+/-s remake so comparisons to original unavoidable.+s technically up there, superb casting and acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Help! There's a maniac after me and I'm not wearing a sports bra!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea was good...The intro was bloodcurdling...But somehow they still messed up.I really had high hopes for this movie. The plot was cool, especially since it was based on a true story (true stories always make movies even scarier). But I already feared from the first scene on that the movie would suck.First of all: the movie goes too fast. By the time the movie is halfway, almost everyone has already been slaughtered or half-dead. I was expecting to see more than just Erin running around with her boobs bouncing up and down.Secondly: the movie is filled with 'stupid idiot' scenes. That's a technique used a lot and I don't mind if there are one or two of these moments in a movie. But it's filled with it! The female lead has just made one idiotic mistake and then she already makes another one. It's frustrating.Finally: What's up with the intro? They tell you five young people got killed by this so called Leatherface. Still, Erin escapes. In exchange they make it look like a twist by showing a policeman and his cameraman were killed by the maniac as well. But they weren't included in the whole 'five victims thing' since that would make six of them. And it can't be the hitchhiker either, since she shot herself. Unless I'm missing some serious plot material, I am very confused.I didn't give this move one or two stars, because the outro was good, plus the acting was also splendid.</fullReview>

I live in Texas and we take history classes about our great and wonderful state. First this nor anything like it happened in Texas it took place in the northeastern U.S. The person this story is based on is the same person the movie psycho is based on. The man did nothing like that depicted in the film. The man was a pervert who killed women and skinned them then wore their skins around. He was caught and is most likely in prison in the town I live in or was executed in Huntsville.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic horror film gets updated to meet modern, bland standards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre of the past is gone towards dusty video-store shelves, but thank god we remake everything that has the slightest of remake potential because this tale of a sideways-thinking family and their physically-challenged boy-turned-serial-killer has all the gadgets and typical lighting and thinking from this new director.The DVD was OK. It didn't make me want to run out and see the old one (even though I've heard that it's a classic by everyone and their mother), and it certainly didn't make me want to see any horror films to be made in the future. It had the same lighting as the new Amityville Horror flick (yes, I know, that came after TCM) which has the same lighting in every new horror flick that isn't scary. The score was boring, as well, with the same generic symphonic blasts as the bad guy bursts through another door and cannot be stopped. The movie wasn't even funny in the B-movie way the original might've had going for it.Even if it wasn't original for today's standards, I think the quality of the shots were slightly better than the original, and I liked the set dressing with the typical mutilated dolls and weird creepiness that spells trouble when watching anything like this film. I loved R. Lee Erney as the town sheriff and the little strange kid, Jedidiah, was played great by David Dorfman. Otherwise, Jessica Biel just has great PR to have her be the girl running around in the wet, white shirt and acting scared...which wasn't awe-provoking or anything. The supporting cast was the best thing about the film; the whole family was very well cast and thought out. I actually loved the new look of Leatherface (which isn't all that different, but a little better looking than the stark-sunlight-shot old design), and from the short clips I've seen of the old one, this new Leatherface acted better and more believable as a crazed man trying to kill all who were normal.The DVD's menu looked like they were going for a Se7en DVD design, and the included music video for some band called Motorgrater sucked (what does a song called "Suffocate" have to do with Leatherface?). I would've liked a director commentary to at least understand what the hell he's thinking from time to time when the action started looking the same.I give the movie a 5 out of 10. It was good, but could've been touched up to make it great and an original film, not another modern horror cliché remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film may be seen as terrible because its both in the shadow of the amazing original and it can be seen as another one of those awful remakes. In some ways it is as most of the time its just a bunch of kids screaming, running, dying, and screaming. And even though the movie has no real depth i myself simply love the torture that the characters go through like Andy who SPOILER finds himself chased by the chainsaw wielding madman, have his leg cut off then hung from a meathook, Mike Vogel does show what I think a person in that situation would show. So overall if you want to see a great addition to the TXC then don't bother, but its worth a rent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of college kids, on their way back from scoring drugs in Mexico, run into a hitchhiker who has just survived a horrific massacre from the night before. They try to help the girl, but in the process end up falling prey to her mysterious fear. It happens to be wielding a chainsaw...To let everyone know, I have not seen the original TCM. I won't know the difference between these two films. I'm just simply watching a horror movie, in my perspective. Great. I saw the film and it's one of those better slasher films because I actually want to watch it several times. I guess you could call it my guilty pleasure.Sure, it's not great or groundbreaking. Sure, it has a couple of clichés. Sure, its disgusting, but I was entertained. It was just a really good, ol' fun horror movie to watch every now and then. I was actually surprised that this film wasn't as violent as I thought. "House of Wax (2005)", a film very similar to this, is much violent. Yeah, I was let down by the death scenes. Okay, so what? What I like about the film is that it's straight forward. There's no twists or turns or anything like that. It's just a maniac chasing and picking people off. Leatherface as a villain is really nice. You get the scary face. You get the scary chainsaw, unlike a small knife or a machete. You get the perfect package for a villain in a horror movie.The cinematography is really good and the score unsettling. There is even one scene that filled me with tension. I'm surprised they got me scared, partly for the bit that they said it was "based on true events", so I was having nightmares that Leatherface will come and kill me when I'm sleeping, one day. I would like to say for those who have not seen the film that it's not based on a true story, which caught me off guard.Now about the cast. Jessica Biel is one of the hottest heroines ever created. She's always showing off her belly button and her see-through shirt. As for her performance, it's really good because it was realistic. I guess I can say that for every actor/actresses being chased by this maniac.Horror fans will be pleased with this. I don't know about the people who cherished the original but I was certainly scared and it left me wanting more. Want a flawed but a well done horror movie? Here you go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average, 2 criticism including a comparison to the original and the movie by itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre looks really good compare to its original, has more stylistic looking shots, and is more gory; but an argument that I will always maintain that quality is better then quantity. The remake suffers from what new horror films have experienced: very attractive protagonists (who's acting' are sub par at best, and as specially Jessica beil), replacement of villain's characters development by gore, unveiling to much of leather face,and very good film. Respectively all those changes hurt the film because it removes from the charm found in the original: 1. the original had actors who looked not like models and superstars but like regular people adding the feel that this could happen to anyone. Also it also hurts the film when you still look attractive even in fear looks less frightening.2. Although i am a huge fan of gore, character development is always a plus. The original films gore factor was substantially prevalent in the 1974 film but the scares mostly came from the murderers' insanity, where their own words speak louder then murder, that in my opinion is scarier. The removal of their character development tone down the villainous family to killing machines rather than unpredictable psychopaths3. Leatherface's appearance is revealed too soon making the character less mysterious. That is also the case by unveiling more then you know about him... I won't spoil the film does it for you.4. The films quality makes everything look too perfect, and the lighting is too good removing grit and creepiness. Darkness and fuzzy looking images always is good in horror because people are always afraid of what they can't see or not clearly distinguish; clear images makes things look clean which also make you feel less uneasy.But on a positive note, some changes make the movie entertaining:1. if you are a big fan of gore, and very slick directing you'll probably enjoy the film. The torture scenes add more dept to the family's involvement in a slaughter house.2. The remake adds an extra scene towards the end that I actually wished occurred in the original.3. The Sheriff character played by R. Lee Ermey is a great, best performance since Full Metal Jacket.4. Their is a bigger inspiration on the savage activities of Ed Geins, the cereal Killer who inspired the creation of the original film.Even though some elements of the original are lost it is worth to see.</fullReview>

All the rest of the movie practically deals with are these teenagers trying to escape from the clutches of this odd family and Leatherface's chainsaw. Some scenes are intense and worth a look, but still not good enough to overcome its kind of muddled script.The talented cast as well as an imaginative director try their best, but don't succeed.

		<shortDescription>Not bad, despite its genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well I've seen this movie and to be perfectly honest I don't know how I feel about it. It's one of those movies that leave me wondering whether I hated it or loved it. I'll start with something simple enough like the cinematography. I appreciated that there were some interesting uses of the camera and that it almost acted like an added character at times. A shot I particularly enjoyed was in the van when the teens are screaming and the camera pans out and we now see the teens through the hole in the dead hitchhiker's head. What I did not care for in terms of cinematography were all the low shots of Erin (Jessica Biel) when she was walking, ensuring that we get a great view of her butt. I found this to be a cheap use of camera movement to please a large part of the targeted audience. Next there was the symbolism. I loved loved loved the shot of Andy (Mike Vogel)in a crucified position. While Erin was able to escape, Andy was caught and tortured brutally. This can be seen as a representation of Jesus, in the sense that he sacrificed himself to save Erin. Then there is also the weapon that Andy carried around with him, which happened to be in the shape of a cross. Whether all this was intentional or not I really liked it. This same scene is my favorite in the movie also because it was so emotional. If there is one great scene that makes up for an otherwise mediocre movie, this is it. While the other deaths disturbed and shocked me, this one actually made me cry. The close up of Andy's face as he looked up upon Erin's arrival spoke volumes. Contrary to the norm of most teen horror flicks, I did not mind the acting in this movie. Jessica Biel gave a solid performance and I realized that Mike Vogel is actually talented. Pain and fear are definitely his strengths. Of course, like all horror movies, this one was annoying at times. For instance, I can't stand it when the group never leaves when it's clear that they should. This is common to most horrors, so this is a problem I have with the whole genre and not just "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" in particular. In spite of being a horror, I liked that there was some character development present in this film. This way you could actually sympathize more effectively with these kids. The set design and lighting were very successful in establishing a most macabre and solemn mood. I think that this is a must in order to produce a decent horror movie. Another aspect very appropriate to this genre was the montage. When Leatherface is cutting up Kemper's dead body to get the materials needed to fashion his mask, we don't actually see this happening. Instead we get a compilation of shots of Leatherface taking thread, scissors, cutting Kemp's shirt, etc. This allows for us to derive our own conclusions, thus making it much more chilling. The music also helped to build up the suspense until the climactic moments. What really bothered me about this movie, was that you wouldn't think it was set in 1973 were it not for the titles. A blatant example of this is the very modern chainsaw. In addition, I don't think the song "Sweet Home Alabama" nor Erin's low rise jeans were quite true to the time it was set in. I also had some "beef" with the dialog, which I found to be below average. Overall this movie loses points for the generic conventions that make it annoying. In spite of its genre, it is a good film in terms of set design, lighting, music, acting, characterization, that all contribute very nicely to the disturbing and macabre mood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The idea of remaking The Texas Chain Saw Massacre isn't really a new one - two of the sequels to the original practically did just that, reworking rather than continuing the storyline.Speaking of sequels, then this remake is preferable to at least two of them, but somehow doesn't quite come off. It's very much a contemporary update, the decision to go for a bookending "documentary realism" style completely undermined by the usage of non-diagegic music throughout.There's too much added, too much muddying what is a very simple story: interbred madman kills people with a chain saw. Here we get a legion of contrivances keeping the photogenic leads from getting away, while the token disabled character has changed from being one of the good guys to one of the villains.Plot isn't necessary in a horror film that relies on visceral thrills, but plot is what we get, as well as an overlong coda and extraneous characters. More to the point, it just isn't scary. Leatherface comes and goes as the script dictates, while gore and sexual titillation take over.Certainly not an awful film or an awful remake, this is nevertheless an inessential piece of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>However unfair, I can't help but compare it with the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure that anyone (especially fans of horror) doesn't have any idea of what to expect from the plot of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. For those who live under a rock, here's a very brief synopsis of the plot - TCM revolves around a group of friends who become stranded while traveling the back-roads of Texas. Unfortunately, they look for help in the wrong place and are soon under attack from a chainsaw welding maniac and his loony family. Most of the lost group of friends will pay for their mistake with their lives.What Works: - Kill Scenes. This is one of the few areas where the remake actually surpasses the original. For all the hype, TCM 1974 is not a very explicitly violent movie. Sure, we know people are dying, but we see very little of the actual carnage. TCM 2003 presents a lot of the gory details very effectively.- Tension. Surprise, surprise ? a modern American horror movie with some atmosphere. While I never felt the sense of dread or foreboding I do when watching TCM 1974, I must applaud the efforts to create tension through some relatively effective atmosphere. A perfect example is the scene where Jessica Biel hides in the closet. Very nicely done.- R. Lee Ermey. While I'm not a fan of most of the members of the "new" family, Ermey is the exception. He would have fit right in with the Sawyers from TCM 1974.What Doesn't Work: - TCM 1974. It was all but impossible for me to watch this movie and not compare it with the original. The original is superior in many ways. Here's a laundry list of things I preferred in the original: the demented, over-the-top family; Marilyn Burns' escape and constant screaming; the dinner scene; the house decorated with human and animal remains; character motivation; and authentic 70s feel. The last item on my list may be a bit unfair, but the remake might have been better had the decision not been made to set it in the 70s. Few of the characters look, act, or "feel" authentic.- Leatherface has a Medical Condition. Please just stop it! Why do many modern movies feel the need to create these ridiculous explanations for every character's motivation? What's wrong with having characters whose motivation is either that they are cannibals, backwards, or just plain evil? - Why Doesn't Jessica Biel Die? This is almost exactly the same problem I had with Wrong Turn. Obviously I know why Biel doesn't die ? you can't kill off the lead actress in the tight white t-shirt. It's all too unrealistic given the other events in the movie. All of the other members of her group are either immediately killed or so severely maimed that there is no real hope of their escape. But not Biel. With only a few scratches, the members of the family seem to take care to keep her "intact" to facilitate her escape. I never got the feeling she was in any real danger.It's probably easy to see that I'm a fan of TCM 1974. It's difficult to explain, but the original has a gritty, brutal, savage "feel" to it that I find missing from most of the remake. And while I enjoyed the remake on a certain level, it has too many problems for me to completely endorse or recommend it.</fullReview>

Erin is absolutely beautiful, I didn't realize she was a popular actress until I saw my husband's FHM. The character of Morgan was excellent, and also poor Pepper. The sheriff was so freakin' scary, as were the two women in the trailer with the baby. This is the best (quote, unquote) "movie to wake up in the middle of the night and watch, type of movie, if you like scary stuff." The ending was a little rushed and I would've like to have seen Erin get home, etc. Definitely watch it if you liked the first one.</fullReview>

This however due to a bigger budget and cast was different. this film is a machine that never stops to put you on the edge of your seat and doesn't stop coming after you like a terminator for an hour and a half. Gone are the horror comedies like scream, which i love, but now just the scare. I wouldn't say the film was jumpy either, more nerve jangling, especially when you see mike vogels nails come from his fingers when trying to not get pulled down the stairs and scratching the wall. They also changed the story a bit but not to much that it was nothing like the original, Once again Leatherface is the character in which the film is centred and is a cult horror character, Biel is gorgeous as well.

		<shortDescription>This is how a remake should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, with so many people complaining about movie remakes I think I should talk a bit about what a good remake should be(in my opinion, of course)in order to clarify some issues. Let's look at the definition of remake:"to make anew or in a different form" so right there one should not be expecting to see the same thing as the original and what would even be the point if the story and the characters were the same? Would it really make that much of a difference if there were just different actors playing the same characters in the same scenarios? We see this all the time in the music industry: How many songs can you name that have recently been "remade"? Probably at least 2 or 3, and with the vast majority of them, they aren't adding anything new or creative to the art form (listen to Nevermore's version of the classic Simon &amp; Garfunkle song "The Sound of Silence" to see an example of a good remake) and movies should be no different.Luckily, the new TCM is an excellent example of what a good remake can achieve- a compelling story that keeps some of the core elements as the original while portraying the scenes in an almost completely different way than in the original, building on the overall horror/suspensefulness of the film. The introduction of new characters was a nice touch, creating memorable characters as in the original. This time around, the story focuses more on Leatherface's character and on the "family", showing you a different perspective on the situation. It seems like in the remake the director wanted to go a more darker, terrifying direction whereas the original has more of an unsettling, creepy atmosphere. The use of lighting was superb and really worked well together with the cinematography to set the tone of the movie. And yes, while a good portion of the scares were "cheap", the movie still does a tremendous job of creating an incredibly uneasy feeling throughout the movie but while still maintaining your interest. Nowadays horror movies rely entirely too much on special effect sand corny gimmicks to draw in a crowd, often times creating some preposterous story with "monsters" that aren't even scary. It's nice to see a horror movie sticking to the basics and excelling, it's something the original TCM did and the remake did as well. I personally would like to see the direction of modern horror movies to go back to the films of the 70's and 80's where the horror elements were based more on the characters and story. So for those of you who just want to see a version of the original with different actors I would not recommend this film, but for the rest of you who are interested in a truly good horror movie, taking a fresh, creative approach to a classic film that's not just "another remake" and can stand on its own, seeing the remake is definitely worth your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director: Marcus Nispel, Script: Scott Kosar, Kim Henkel, Toby Hopper, Cast: Jessica Biel, Jonathan Tucker, Erica Leerhsen, Mike Vogel, Eric Balfour, R. Lee ErmeyI know a lot of people will say otherwise just because it is a remake but let me tell you folks, this is a way better than average remake. This is not a scene for scene rehash of the original. It is a rewrite with many changes in the script so if you have not seen this movie you should give it a try. For example, when they pick up the hitch hiker, it is a girl this time, an apparent victim. Also their is a little boy that is a part of the family that ends up helping these people. And last but not the least, the addition of R Lee Ermey as the totally a-hole sheriff. The absolute villain in this film. However, their is some things about this film that upon viewing I find extremely irritating and it is all do to poor research on the part of the director and screen writer. First of all, the song Sweet Home Alabama by Lynyrd Skynyrd that is played at the beginning of the movie came out in 1974, yet this is supposed to be 1973. Actually, even Skynyrd's first album ,pernounced, didn't come out until Sep. 1973. Lynyrd Skynyrd were not yet well known in 1973. They should have used a more established group of the time such as The Allman Brothers as their concert destination. And STD are they trying to be pc or what! I was born in the 1960's and I know as a fact that back then it was called VD. The cast do not talk, dress or act like they did in 1973. It would have been much better had they simply given it a contemporary setting. The director and screenwriter obviously know nothing about the 1970's. At any rate, the film does have its share of suspense with good cinematography(Daniel Pearl who also did the original film) good sets (thay did a good job of creating a similar dreary house). If one can get over some of its idiosyncrasy as I already stated it is a decent film in its on right. Although it is still not as scary as the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should Have Left It Alone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood is remaking everything these days, trying to ride the reputation of past successes to make an easy buck. This movie epitomizes this disgusting trend.This "remake" took nothing from the original. New Line pretty much rewrote the script. One ridiculous thing that was added to the story was answering the question: Why would Leatherface want to kill teenagers? Answer: poor Leatherface had a skin disease and kids made fun of him. That explanation was totally unnecessary and downright laughable. The great thing about the original was that the family was a group of cannibals. This part is pretty much erased from the storyline. If you remake something, then add/enhance the original, don't rewrite it.It was supposed to take place in the 70's and the director tried to convey that it was the 70's with its lame intro, obvious digital effect of a black and white digital camera. The only thing 70's about this movie was the Dodge van. Everything from the Ashton Kutcher hair-do's to the Urban Outfitter clothes wreaked of MTV. It looked like the cast from "That 70's Show".Dialogue..awful. Acting..awful. Enough said here.The deaths are OK, not very creative. I do appreciate, however, that parts were uncompromisingly brutal. In one instance, with Andy hanging there with meat hook piercing is heart and lungs. No way would the guy be conscious for very long, let alone alive.Overall this movie was for the casual MTV youth who had never heard of or seen the original. That is what New Line made: a piece of trash that most fans don't even remember coming out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than what was expected.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Intro ... Starts of with a grainy police video documenting and reporting a gruesome chain of events, the flashback story ensues...The Scenario ... Five teenagers from the days of classic rock and male mustaches driving on a Texan road en-route to a rock concert. After a few minutes one realizes Erin (Jessica Biel) will be the dominating character in the events to follow.The Story ... Is not really too complex. They find a disoriented drifter who does something which will change everything for the group. Eventual reliance on a sheriff and seeking help from a prominent house on the prairie leads to their downfalls to come.The camera-work is very retro and stylish. I never saw the original but this keeps one on their guard throughout the movie. The artistic and detailed camera angles also help. The gore is not too high and overdone which was great. The teenagers themselves aren't the usual idiots but you actually begin to respect 2-3 of them.There are some silly bits in the movie which have to do with the longevity issues of being alive after being chainsawed but then this isn't a perfect movie. Also there are questions of why didn't he or she do this or that etc including a bizarre sub-plot in the end.Who Should Watch It ... I enjoyed this movie, it was much better than what I expected (Scream or FReddy movies). Its not great but good enough to rent and watch in a group/alone. If you've run out of quality horror movies to watch, go for this one, its pretty good quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>in my opinion i think it should have been rated higher than a 5.9, i rated it a seven, it was a more than decent film and leatherface looked awesome in the movie, how relevant it is to the original I would not know, but I can say that it is sure to give what horror fans want, a good scare, as far as it being based on actual events i am not to sure, because the character of leatherface I noticed was given a different "real name" maybe to make it seem more convincing than the name, Bubba. R. Lee Ermey(Sheriff Hoyt) did an excellent part and as i said earlier, I'm not sure if it was real footage or not, but while watching it in the dark, the scariest parts were at the end where it was made to look like real footage. The whole atmosphere was creepy, and the characters (one of my favorites, Old Monty) were unreal and frightening. A great movie sure to please horror fans, and as far as a worthy remake, you can be the judge of that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sadistic doesn't mean suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was little - I am from 73- my older sister told me about the Texas chainsaw massacre. A film so horrifying that I wouldn't eat meat for weeks. I couldn't imagine a film being so scary and I could feel my heart beat in excitement.Fast forward to the present day. I have seen the old version and about a million slasher flicks besides that one. Perhaps it is my age but I feel more excitement tingling down my spine nowadays when seeing pictures like boogeyman or darkness that hint the horror more then actually showing it than the sadistic turn most horrors nowadays take.This film shows scenes that you once only saw in those straight to video unrated flicks, unnerving scenes like the one with the salt and the cut off leg.. and the hook scene that lands in someone his back.Seems that in your face horror is more the trend of todays viewers, something the king of shallowness Micheal Bay seem to have grasped. However it is strange that besides the leg scene all the other chainsaw deaths happen off camera.. chickened out at the last moment perhaps? But this is a flick that had its time in the cinemas all over, a so called "mainstream flick". For such a film it has it share of cringing scenes, it has its dark corridors and it has its capable fairly likable cannon fodder, some vital point the house of wax misses.But is it exciting or suspense full? Not at all, it is still predictable and I dare to pose the question if the sequels to the original Texas chainsaw massacre are better then this one. If memory serves me right good old Dennis hopper has a part in one of those.So on the suspense part it falls flat, on the blood and gore and sadism department is shines... so to say. One can argue if this was just a tactic to hide the fact they weren't able to build up some genuine tension.Rent it for a low fee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The scariest movie I have ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CAST: Jessica Biel, Jonathan Tucker, Mike Vogal, Eric Baulfur, Erica Leerson, Andrew Byrowski, R. Lee Ermy, David Dorfman.When ever I'm going to spoil something big, I put the letters in numbers so if you don't want anything spoiled, I wont. If you do care, look at the buttons on your phone, and on the buttons 2-9 have the alphabet underneath.PLOT: Remake of the so called "cult classic" . 5 friends (Biel, Tucker, Vogal, Baulfur, and Leerson) make a big mistake when they pick up a traumatized, crying girl who they almost ran over with they're van. The girl warns the about they're lives and then kills herself.Then 5 stop in a little town in Texas to try and find the sheriff. The 5 are then stalked and killed 1 by 1 by a maniac with a chainsaw.REVIEW: I had never heard of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre Intel I saw a preview for a remake. I thought it looked interesting since I am a huge horror movie buff so I went to IMDb .com and looked it up and found out it was a remake. I decided to rent the original at Hollywood Video and I didn't see why people liked it so much. It was nowhere near as gruesome, brutal, and scary as people say it is. The only part that scared me is when 843 489 46 843 9433524247 dies. So I thought this was going to be crap, so the day it came out (i didn't have any money) I spoiled the deaths for myself by reading peoples posts. The next day (Saturday) I saw it. Even though I new who dies, how they die, and when they die, the movie scared the hell out of me. I have seen a ton of horror movies and this ranks number 1 in the scariest. Seriously, this is the scariest movie I have ever seen. I have never jumped out of my seat so many times in any other movie. Me, and the audience around me must have screamed more then a dozen times. A side from being jump-out-of-your-seat-scary, the movie is extremely suspenseful and bone chilling. A couple of times I felt like my heart stopped. You get to know the characters better then in the 1st one. I n the first one I didn't even know Sally and Franklin were related Intel I saw they had the same last name in the closing credits. The acting is much better then in the 1st one, I bet Tobe Hooper saw Marilyn Burns working at McDonalds and asked her to play the female lead. Sorry, but there is no nudity, but even if Jessica Beil and Erica Leerson said they would be happy to take there tops off, there wouldn't be a treasonable time for it since the movie takes place in 1 day. The deaths are pretty cool, some of them are pretty gory and some are disturbing, 6453 86425's death is still the most disturbing death I have ever seen.I recommend this to anyone who loves being scared (like me) or are huge movie buffs or just don't have anything better to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some years ago I saw the 1974's shocker "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and I was shocked because it was one of the scariest movies I've ever saw. Then I heard that Michael Bay was going to make a remake of that story and I had doubt if it would stay on the same line as the original, but this remake surprised me at all.They updated parts of the original story but I felt that it was better than watching the same story again but with a new cast. I loved this remake, and it's even scarier as it's original movie. There are more on-screen killings than the original 'cause in the original we only did get see only 2 on-screen killings, and the remake has more on-screen killings.Jessica Biel was perfect as the female lead, she was very convincing on her role. And the new Leatherface was also creepy, even the chainsaw that is bigger than the original made him more scarier.I gave this movie 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>maybe it's because I'm used to and respect the original so much, i don't know. But I had a hard time buying in to this remake. I thought it was a bit to staged and just didn't have the raw tension and grittiness as the first. I mean, when you watch Tobe Hooper's original masterpiece, you feel like you got to take a shower! now for people who never seen the original, I can see how they would like this version. compared to some horror films out there, especially some remakes, since there seem to be a gazillion of them. but gunner-Hanson in the original was creepy as hell. the scene where he whacks the dude in the head with the hammer like the slaughter-house is incredible. but the re-mastering of the print looked good. leatherface dancing with the chainsaw at the end is sweet. I'd say the remake isn't terrible, but check out the original for a true classic.</fullReview>

There was no lack of imagination in this movie, from the girl with the gun between her legs, to the boy with the chopped off leg on the meat hooks, it couldn't get better then this. It played on the human obsessions, fears deep hidden in the subconscious mind. I was chewing on a blanket the entire time (not because it was scary...but because it was just so realistically disgusting!) I wont give anymore hints...but this was just a great movie! If you have seen the original TCM, you'll probably love this one as well. The makers of this film did a wonderful job, depicting the era..which was very convincing. The acting was astonishing and the script work fit the period as well. The movie earned all of the 8 points I gave it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all know that Micheal "screw reality... BLOW STUFF UP!!!" Bay is Satan. With that said, this crap is pretty tolerable. This film probably contains the best gun-hidden-in-the-vagina scene in movie history! The obvious "Blair-Witch" framing is retarded; and the "period" film feels about as 70s as "Dawson's Creek".The inclusion of a "Sweet home Alabama" sing-along didn't cut it. But I kinda liked this piece of poop. They know that the original was sick and dirty. It's 14 times better than any of the current avalanche of horror remakes. R. Lee("What is that, Private Pyle??!!?!?) Ermy does a nice job as a cracker cop, and the sultry Jessica Biel(in dirty-girl-jeans and a belly-shirt) is too hot. The rest of the cast is low-rent chainsaw fodder. Throwing a cracker-kid and cracker-elderly folks in the film was dumb, too. But decent movie-making shines through a couple of times,though. This remake is only kind-of useless. Lets just say it's better than Chainsaw 3 and the shitball sequel-remake with Rene Zellwegger combined. Worth a look, because Jessica Biel looks soooo foxy . Easily, she possesses the Shimmering-Torso of the year. They gave this remake a decent effort- Horror fans(myself included) will have fun.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocrity Makes Money...Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When held up against many of the recent horror remakes, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre doesn't fare too badly. With a strong R-rating, the movie makes a brave attempt to actually scare people, rather than simply provide a few teen-friendly chills. In the cinema, the movie seemed dark, nihilistic and a grueling 90 minutes of sadism and insanity. On the small screen (in a DVD shamefully lacking in extras), the effect is very much reduced, and the holes become far more apparent.Firstly, the positive. Daniel Pearl, clearly the most talented individual involved in the original movie returns as cinematographer. Alas, we see none of the searing, burnt color palette that made the original such a visually exciting movie. Instead, we get the usual desaturated blues and greens, which seem to have inexplicably become the hallmark of horror movies over the last five years. Pearl does, however, attempt to create a little artistry, and several shots are beautifully composed and lit. The soundtrack makes good use of some of the original effects, particularly the oddly chilling whine of the camera flash. The production design as a whole provides a pleasing enough backdrop of rotten decay, though it all looks a little too professionally styled to ever be convincing.The script, however, is completely formulaic. The original was padded out to 80 minutes with long and drawn out sequences of our heroine being chased through the woods. The remake, believing modern audience require at least 90 minutes for their $10, and not having the patience for tedious chases, create several subplots to flesh out the story and running time. Unfortunately, none of these subplots work. The crazy sheriff rapidly became an exercise in boring sadism, the attempt to humanize the family by giving them a motive was laughably underwritten, and the whole stolen-baby storyline screamed padding from a 1000 yards. Many of the performances were so over-the-top as to be both tedious and irritating, and worst of all, I cared nothing for a single character. Oh, and the idea that all this is taking place in the early 1970's is completely laughable as absolutely no attempt is made to create a period setting.The original is, in my opinion, one of the most important American movies of the 1970's. It is a raw, brutal, irrational, step into insanity. The remake is a reasonably enjoyable, highly polished, highly contrived attempt to cash in on its predecessor's reputation. While the original will be debated over in another fifty years, the remake will have vanished from Blockbuster's shelves within five.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proof that modern horror remakes can be great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films like this scare me. Not so much in terms of the horror aspect of it, although this is a good entry in that genre, but more in the sense that there have been a myriad of horror remakes lately and some of the icons of the genre like Dawn of the Dead, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre are being remade. This leads to the question, if they can remake films like these, then what is to stop them from doing remakes of Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street? I have already heard that The Hills Have Eyes is in the works and I think I heard something about the Toolbox Murders on the way. Interesting that this will give today's youth a chance to see these films but not so good news for those of us that are purists at heart and like to see the classics left alone.Having said all of that, I have to say that Marcus Nipsel's neo Texas Chainsaw Massacre is just brilliant. It pays homage to, and never strays far from what made the original so revered, but it obviously makes a mark for itself with its original style. All of the elements of the original are here as well.Jessica Biel and Eric Balfour are the two young lovers in the movie traveling with friends to a Lynnrd Skynnrd concert. They are in the back roads of Texas and come across a destitute and indigent looking young girl wandering aimlessly along the road. They pick her up and after telling the kids that they are all going to die, she pulls a gun out of her dress and blows her brains out. This all happens in the first ten minutes of the film and it sets the tone and the pace for what is to come.The kids are a little cocky and give off that aura of invincibility and sanctimony. When they have to call the police at the local variety store, they are impolite and short with the employees. Their world, until this day, was a closed circle and nothing could really get to them. But today that is all about to change. Today, things will done to them that seemed inhuman only a few short hours ago.The true strength of this film is that all of the evil characters are true abominations. They are cruel, unabashed incarnations of Mephastopheles. There is nothing redeeming about any of them. To some, this might take away credibility from the screenplay, but to me, it enhances. Leatherface and his family exist to be evil. They exist to provide terror to those unfortunate enough to get caught in their nasty web. These kids are victims of circumstance.There will be inevitable comparisons between this and the original, and that is fair, but although the two movies share a name and a background, both stand on their own as separate works of art. Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the ten best horror films ever made. It is an exercise in the macabre and it tests your mettle. While Marcus Nipsel's is a brilliant film, it does stand on it's own and it has managed to carve a niche in todays modern horror landscape. This movie is tense and it is a psychological exercise in sanity. While the original was a benchmark in psychological warfare, this one tries to go one step further. If you can remember some surreal moments like the meat hook scene, this one tries to take it a step further. I truly believe that this film can stand on its own, and while it is certainly not better than the original, it is a very fine entry into the genre and deserves to have the name Texas Chainsaw Massacre.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watch this movie and really thought of it as one of the bunch. The script could have been better. The horrific side of the movie goes with big noises, sudden changes of the camera, the camera swinging one side to the another, and 'surprising' appearances of the killer, i say surprising because in the end you don't know how he got to that place. Predictable, i would say. I didn't expect it to be AS the original, but at least to extend the story of the family, it did, but not enough for my taste. Yes, some kind of stupidity goes with that extremely strong instinct of surviving, but suddenly changing the behavior of the character Erin, to fit in the behavior of the girl at the beginning of the movie, it just feels wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie made Roger Ebert's top 10 worst movies of 2003. I have to say I do not agree. I thought it was well shot. I liked the freak show atmosphere. This movie was not great, and not original. There have been a million slasher films already made, but this movie was kind of freaky, disturbing, and borderline shocking.The original TCM was made 30 years ago. I guess the question is "Why do it again?" I never saw the original. I have seen the million sequels, but not the original. I apologize; I really should see the movie that started it all. The original TCM spawned a million remakes and clone movies. Admittedly, the original should pay respect to the original slasher fest the movie Psycho. Psycho was made in 1960, (45 years ago!). TCM is 14-year psycho's junior. TCM added uncomfortable to the already existing platform that Psycho did 14 years earlier. The 2003 TCM movie is just a re-make. Re-make movies are often failures. I can only think of a couple successes and many failures of remakes. Cape Fear was probably the best remake I can think of seeing. Well anyway, it was exciting enough to raise my blood pressure slightly. It was not one of the worst movies of last year in my opinion. It was average.70/100</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bland remake goes for modern gloss where original's grit clearly supports its vast superiority.A bit like the 70's version, a pretty mediocre and unheard of cast (Vaguely bar the female lead (Jessica Biel) who apparently stars in something called Seventh Heaven) set out on the road in a van. Their goal this film is to get to a Skynaard gig, and a bit like the original film they're all members of that secret elite called 'the beautiful people'.What they don't know is they're all about to suffer a 'nightmare beyond their worst fears...an' stuff...yeah'.Basically this remake suffers a complete lack of imagination and ingenuity and replaces hard hitting twisted gritty horror of the original with gore and extreme suggestion of painful violence with occasional graphic depiction of said violence.It also uses a greater amount of thriller-chase tension to create the fear, with an absolute lack of cerebral scares in evidence. There is little genuinely disturbing about this film. There are enough sick inferrings of impending pain to make you cringe a little, but that's about it.The acting is actually half-decent, surprisingly. Sure, we don't really get to learn much about these characters, and we don't really gain a massive affinity with them, but we don't really want to see them suffer and they're all *reasonably* convincing in their roles.The direction is purely by the numbers though, with absolutely none of the brilliant flair of the original in evidence. There's none of the despair or claustrophobia it had, and it's all gloss and pseudo shock instead.Leatherface is also given more screen time, but I would have to say he pretty fills the same role to a tee as Gunnar Hanson's Leatherface of the original. Unfortunately he reveals his true face which was a bad move. The unidentified and mysterious killer is a more fearful one than another which reveals itself.The biggest thing missing from the remake is the dinner sequence. That was a superbly depraved view from inside the home of a family of cold insane killers, and it is gone from the remake. A real pity that.Overall, watcheable enough but lacking in anything like the quality of the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never been a fan of remakes, and have always found them a cynical money-spinner for play-it-safe production companies. Therefore, it was with worry that I approached the remake of 1973's 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.' Let's face it, without the infamous TCM name attached to it, this film is just another 'isolated teens meet mad serial killer' of which too many examples already exist. Indeed, the similarities between this and 'Wrong Turn' are numerous. So let's begin with the negatives. The acting isn't great, and whoever managed the costume department needs firing. Considering this is meant to be set in '73, why do most of the cast look like they just walked out of your local Vans skate shop? Secondly, all the characters follow the same yawning stereotypes of teenage horror stars, and the redneck baddies are pretty much laughable, except for the Sheriff, who puts in one of the film's few good performances and comes across as a genuine creep. In terms of camera-work and lighting, I believe that much of the cinematography is just right. The director has done a good job of portraying the isolation and shadowy mystery of the setting, which brings me on to the actual horrors portrayed. Again, these horrors have been shot and implemented well. There is just the right amount of gore that some acts of violence are left to the imagination. Much of the violence is genuinely cringe-worthy. As a result, if you're looking for a bog-standard Friday evening horror, then you can't really go wrong with this. However, if you're expecting a life-changing, forward-thinking piece on a par with the original then look elsewhere. 5/10.</fullReview>

The remake, on the other hand, had some slick cinematography, and did a good job of exploring Leatherface/Hewitt, which really helped raise it from the mediocre film it could have been. However, the rest of the film is relatively old school schlock, which is refreshing in today's film--haven't seen a blood fest since the Nightmare on Elm Street films. Don't expect Academy Awards, but if you haven't seen the original, or if you weren't impressed by the original, then by all means go see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been living in fear of this film since I saw a poster for the original when I was 6 years old. I finally summoned up the courage to watch it (on a sunny afternoon) and am glad the ordeal is over.What's to like: the roller-coaster ride of the story, the believable characters and acting, the cinematography. The black and white police video clip was a nice twist but could have perhaps been a more integral part of the film, rather than just bookends. The sheriff was very unnerving and plot-wise, there were enough loose ends to spur discussions after the viewing - not necessarily a bad thing from a marketing perspective. I also am grateful that the filmmakers didn't use cheap shock tactics (cut to a scary sight and make a loud sound) to keep viewers scared.What's not to like: if you have seen "Jeepers Creepers", the story in this one will not be a surprise. Swap the pair of wings for a chainsaw and there you have it. I was in this situation and found the first half of "Jeepers Creepers" more unnerving but the second half of this one more engrossing. So watch both, and see what you think.Fans of this film who want something similar set in modern times (instead of 1973) should also watch the X-File episode set in the same part of the country featuring a murderous family and spooky soundtrack. I can't recall the series or the name of the episode but it was very disturbing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand who rate such a great movie below 7 - probably some vegetarians or hippies. I love violence on screen - war, gangster and proper scifi stuff is my favourite. this film is good in many ways - a lot of blood (if you have weak nerves you will want to sick - believe you me) and a lot of violence. I also found girls in this movie very attractive. So - if you are not looking for something clever to think after (like Taxi Driver or Pi) and you love violence and blood and big tits - this film for you and you will have great fun. One more thing - Rob Zombie movie which is based on the same story and i can't remember it's name ("House of 1000 corpses" or something like that) is way much worse than this masterpiece of bloodshed "Texas Chanisaw Masacre".Enjoy the movie Sergei</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Wrap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) has received a bad wrap from self-proclaimed horror "experts" (wearing their Evil Dead T-shirts proudly) all the way up to the big man himself, Ebert. If you look at this movie as one based on the original, not as a remake, you will be pleasantly surprised. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) is truly one of the most infamous horror movies of all time. The impact this movie has had on the genre as well as society even to this day is obvious. All the fan-boys spouting off hatred towards this new film and its creators need to calm down!!! If you are truly such a fan of the original you should know that just about the only similarity between the two is that Leatherface is the killer. The new version is a well thought out and interesting take on the original story as told by Tobe Hooper. Re-written with new characters added and old ones removed, this film should stand alone on its on merits and shouldn't be compared to the original. Marcus Nispel brings a polished "hollywood" touch to the film but still manages to keep a realism to it, albeit no where near as real and gritty as the first. Many have approached Nispel's previous career as a music video director with cynicism. Spike Jonze seems to be doing alright in the movie biz don't you think? Nispel takes on the absolutely daunting task of re-directing a classic genre film and firmly holds his ground in the world of horror.Now I know a lot of people are going to say how can you not compare a re-make to the original? Well in the case of TCM (2003) it's a new group of characters entangled in a similar situation as the original, similar, not the same. If you were to buy a 1974 Cadillac De Ville in 1974, you would have a pretty nice ride. If you were to buy a 2003 Cadillac De Ville in 2003, you would have the same basic components as the one from '74, but with a modern twist on the aesthetics and overall mechanics. Their both great cars, just tailored to be appropriate for a certain place in time.Is the new TCM great? No, but it's a whole heck of a lot better then the die-hards are giving it credit for. I strongly recommend seeing it for yourself and making your own conclusions, don't let your neighborhood video store clerk enforce his horror mandate upon you!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>O.K. remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually I enjoy watching this movie again and again and frankly don't see the point of boycotting it comparing with the original 74. They have different genres. The original is more like black comedy, and this one is a violent thriller. Hooper's masterpiece will never be forgotten, and this one will be one of the best remake-efforts. They've changed the script of course. The year is the same 1973, but there's no invalid brother Franklyn and no Sally Hardesty. There's no Texas grave-robbery and the heroes move to Dallas to get to Lynyrd Skynyrd concert. Their problems began as a hitchhiker girl commits a suicide in their van right when they're just to drive into Texas and they vote to inform the police about what happened? I'm sorry, but I want to do some comparison with the original. The new script I found much more interesting. The 74's was scarier of course but the characters here are much more interesting. Only Jessica Biel's handsomeness is enough to watch this movie, but that's not the only the makers have our attention with. The film is really good. Leather face was nicely arranged. He's serious, physically strong, he knows what to do. On the other hand, he enjoys working with chainsaw. Andrew Briniarski was the smartest leather face, I like this combination. So, after our heroes try to find the local sheriff, one of them is being killed, and another one's left with one leg later when they try to find their missing friend. The rest of the movie you'll watch with one breath. I'm not telling you more not to spoil the surprise in case you haven't seen it yet. I'll only say there's a lot of entertaining. Perhaps some of you will disagree with my point of view, but I hope they'll remake the second part, right this way, so that nobody would argue if the original second or the remade second part's better. About this remake: I never mind remakes, and this one is excellent to lead by example. After "Texas chainsaw massacre 2", an excellent sequel with Dennis Hopper (directed by Hooper) this is the best leather face movie you'll see. Just don't connect this with loyalty to the original: Hooper himself said in his interview he really liked it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Try it - you should</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you think that you have the right taste for estimating value of movies, you love to see well made, serious movies, can you expect that something titled"Texas chainsaw massacre"is going to be good for you? When you are not a great fan of horror movies(not too serious movies) and did not see most of their classics and the first version of TCM you are not expecting too much from this title besides 2003 gore fx. So don't do that and start it. Despite all different opinions it is worth seeing. The plot is almost standard - a group of teenagers durying some trip have to stop and discover something terrifying. But the entrance of the movie suggesting that it is inspired by true story is hitting your feelings. You know that the psycho with chainsaw is closing and you wait for him. Even before seeing him, suddenly you may see that the climate of movie is getting you and you may appreciate it(you wanted horror). The colours, the sound and action are telling you that nothing positive(in terms of events in movie) is about to happen. The situation of characters is getting worse and you may start to feel the horror - that what this movie is about. It will show you in good way images and events which you would not like to see or experience in reality. The gore is not only awful fx in huge amounts but it may pull your imagination to dark, terrifying place where all horror movies should take their watchers. If above opinions are enough for you, go start the movie and come back here later. If you already have seen the movie and did not like it at all you might have not been in right mood for this movie - horror, or you have your own, very personal taste. It is the first time when I write my opinions and I did it because I think that 5,9 from 10 ranking on IMDb for this movie sends wrong information. It is to low for the movie which may be bloody pleasant, hard to find surprise which make you freeze in front of the screen. The technical side of the movie alone is above that ranking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie terrified me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being from Wisconsin and growing up with tales of demented serial killers (including the man this movie is loosely based on, Ed Gein), I am fascinated by the stories and as a result love gory horror flicks. Not often am I moved in any way by them. However, TCM blatantly scared the hell out of me.The original didn't do all that much for me, though I enjoyed the story. The 2003 remake made my blood run cold and my hands shake. I felt the casting was perfect and it stayed relatively true to the original. I don't know what exactly it was about this movie, but it really freaked me out. I think it's that it felt so real - as though the events really happened and that might be because the cinematography was so well done. Regardless, it's worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is quite possibly, the worse remake ever made. I wasn't a big fan of the original, but it is a horror classic. THIS ISN'T. How anyone could be scared of this crap, I'll never understand. I've yet to understand Generation Y can say the original isn't scary, but this is. There is nothing scary about this film. I've seen episodes of SpongeBob SquarePants that was scarier. And had more suspense. I looked at the clock on my cell phone over 20 times hoping this was over and I could have the time back. It ranks with the Exorcist Prequel as another horrible movie that should never have been made. The ONLY thing worth watching is Jessical Biel walking around in those jeans, but God, the horrible crap you have to put up to see that. Add in the "cameo" of Harry Knowles (nothing personal Harry) and that was a highlight. I give this Negative 10 stars on a 1-5 scale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Lord, I don't even know why I'm bothering. It's 1:30 am and I just finished watching this pointless, hopelessly unnecessary remake. I dunno, even getting into this for true students of American Horror cinema (of American Independent Cinema, period) would be like discussing the merits of Blink 182 covering the White Album by the Beatles. It's just a dead argument to begin with. So, with that being said, let's pretend that a remake HAD to be made, like some weird law dictated it so. Let me ask a few questions:One: Did it bring anything new to the table?No. Well, what little it did was total nonsense. Took a simple, if crude and fantastic, story and gave it more useless and idiotic plot zigzags that added nothing and left you groaning, saying "What the Hell was the point of making (fill in the character) do THAT?"Two: Did it make the story it's own (like say Johnny Cash's rendition of Rusty Cage)? Not really. Just a lot of un-scary, uninvolving junk. It took the strange journey of Sally Hardesty and her friends and changed it into some plot to get to a Skynyrd concert. The victims were in a sense outsiders, unlike in the original where the Saw family was a twisted mirror image of the protagonists, a comment on the decay of the modern family post-war unit in decline. This new one offered ONE slim and idiotic insight as to why ANY of this carnage and twisted society exists: "Leatherface" had a skin disease as a child and people would taunt him, so he's allowed to be a twisted butcher with about a baker's dozen of family members who go along with their normal-esquire daily lives.Ah, I'm done. I could go on for literally thousands of words on this topic (sad, isn't it?). Let's just say the original deserves it's accolades and standing as not only a classic horror milestone but also as an American Cinematic Original, while this remake is simply Hollywood crap. Just pointless. Without the name "Chainsaw", it would be a disposable genre filler, with even less style than you typical late 80's-early 90's fare (Hell, this one almost makes the wonderful ridiculousness of Dennis Hopper's chainsaw duel in "Saw 2" in the mid 80's look like Citizen Kane in comparison). It's like every one directly involved had NO IDEA WHATSOEVER the original meant, was saying or NOT saying, showing or NOT showing. They wanted to make what we all feared they would when we heard they were doing a remake: a generic, muddled, over the top yetconvoluted slasher film.Yup, a steamin' pile. As Casey Kasem once said,"Ponderous . . . (expletive) ponderous, man".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A dark story of the lines and wrinkles on the face of Ed Gein. The Feared man who is still being talked about today. The Crimes he portrayed are still the most bizarre crimes which will have sparked the movie The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Jessica Biel played a terrific part as she was the Cowgirl who got thrown around most of the movie and put to levels of fear no one could create except for Leatherface himself. Andy Vogel played a role that was hard as you see him massacred on a meat hook with his torn up leg dangling. He played a very cocky character in the movie but still had a great look for the horror film. The Movie itself was dark and captured Fear in the beginning and especially the ending. The Old Version of TCM is still one of those shocking movies you see and really can enjoy Tobe Hoper for the work he did in the film. I think the new version tried to capture more of the fear that Leatherface was trying to portray. The old version was just to shock most of the fans. I wasn't shocked as much as I saw the fear in the eyes of the victims and they whole psychological mind games that you play trying to figure out why leatherface would do these things. The Soundtrack is also a great soundtrack by Steve Jablonsky... Leatherface is the first track which is a great theme for the movie... And the song that is in the Trailer Cocteau Twins-Song to the Siren is also a great song that is different for the mood of the movie... The movie overall is still one of my favorite horror movies and I hope they come out with more!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the original TCM is one of my favorite horror movies, this one had a lot to live up to when I rented it one night. It surpassed my expectations, and there were even some things I liked in it that were better than the original. The spooky, rural atmosphere was very well done, and you get to know the characters much better than in the original. There were moments where (even for a movie like this) that I thought were a little over the top with the gore (the part with the amputated leg and the salt for instance) that in some ways seemed to trivialize the movie to me and make it not as scary, but more "let's see how gross we can make this". Overall, I really liked this movie. It had a lot of energy and I was actually on the edge of my seat towards the end. I would recommend watching it--especially if you're a fan of the 1974 version.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a horror! However, is the film so scary?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, based on the original version of 1974, shows the story of a group of teenagers who come back from Mexico. They are cheerful, smoke marijuana and make love. The mood changes when they, by chance, take a hitchhiking teenage girl who commits suicide in their car by shooting into her throat. That's the moment when their horror starts. The tense atmosphere turns out to be felt. When they are in a trouble of what to do with the dead body, they call a sheriff. He seems suspicious and later appears to be so.The Hewitt house? At the beginning, the director showed this well. Every moment of any movement made me stare at the screen trembling. But, when the man - killer starts to chase the girl, it loses its gist of horror. In the second half of the film, the tense atmosphere and thrill is almost lost. The running, shouting, chasing, the sound of the chain, and nothing else. The movie turns into a kitsch!And the action? What, in fact happens to the girl who stays at the car just after others escape from the chainsaw killer?The movie is half good and half very weak. For the first half I give 9/10, for the second half 2/10. It seems that producers had an idea how to do it but did not retain it throughout. The fact that the story is based on true facts should have inspired them to make it better. However, in spite of the drawbacks of the movie, I do recommend it for the Halloween night. It may serve as well spent evening. Although I don't like horrors very much, this night is an exception. Everybody should see one. Enjoy it!SPOILER: One advice: skip the scene in which they wrap the dead body of the teenage girl. The sheriff is showed as a very deviated man! If you see it, don't take it too seriously!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wacko weekend part 4: A remake that actually gets away with murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm no big fan of remakes, though I do not consider it a crime to make one. I for instance did not even consider watching the remake of Get Carter (the remake seemed needless and dumb with such a good original) yet I enjoyed the remake of The Italian Job much better than the original (which I saw first and in which I saw a great deal of potential that just was not brought to the screen). With the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre my feelings were somewhere in between the just described ones. I both felt that the original was good enough as it were and that a remake was not needed, YET I also saw a a thing or two I did not like and which could have been better (as the scene when the heroine 'meets' the family). So eventually there came a time in which I felt like watching the remake and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. First of all the film did not become the splatter-fest I imagined it to be and there were about just as many subtle hints to brutality than there were in the original. Second of all, the slightly altered story and character development was good as were all the actors and the directing (owing a huge deal to original and remake cinematographer Daniel Pearl no doubt). The remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is as thrilling as the original and I can recommend everyone to see it (if you can't find the original anywhere and even if you already saw it) although I found the original to be more uncompromising, raw, creepy and insane than the remake. Kudos to everyone involved in the making of the original for that, but kudos to everyone involved in the making of this film, for making a good remake every once in a while.7,5 out of 10 (with an 8 given upon voting)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like most people, I was dismayed to hear that Hollywood were churning out another remake in their vain attempt to end the drought of ideas around at the moment. But unlike Get Carter, Oceans Eleven, etc this is not a stain on the originals reputation and is actually well shot with some great cinematography and has a storyline which takes the original and adds it's own style to it without diverting from the TCM feel.Though the original has a very sinister, humid feed to it, partly due to it's low budget origins, this version lacks the same feel but still does a fine job and of course is far more gorier than the original.It's amazing to think the director of the excreble Pearl Harbor can pull off such a respectable tribute to Tobe Hooper's classic and will pleasantly surprise hard-core fans of the original.</fullReview>

I mean I've seen scarier scenes from resident evil. Throughout the movie there could've been a little better of a story and more scarier scenes. The whole movie just goes by so fast because of it's gore and action. I like Leatherface in the movie. He's really cool and the actor does him really good but it doesn't save the movie still. The only major think I liked in the movie was the ending when they show the real footage. Now that was really scary how he just pops up and kills those two men. That was the only thing that was really good.Hedeen's outlook: 4.5/10 D- *+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grotesque Gore-Fest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", despite what the tagline would have you to believe, is based on little more than a homicidal incident somewhere in Texas, the "chainsaw" massacre simply contrived to mislead you into believing such a horrendous incident actually occurred, while researching such an incident suggests that this never happened, and the film is simply based on a typical murder (big deal). While it is in no way "based on a true story", the film is a dark, sordid piece of perverse and twisted "entertainment", containing some of the most brutal, gory, and horrific sequences ever produced for film. It perplexes the mind to imagine such an atrocious concept would manage to garner an "R" rating instead of an "NC-17"; this definitely qualifies as one of the most morally bankrupt films to ever come out of Hollywood, and certainly shouldn't be allowed to be viewed by all of the public. If one cannot stomach the sight of a chainsaw hacking into bodies, a horrifying sequence where a tormented female "survivor" is being chased through a grotesque butchery (the sound of a chainsaw close-by), and the most vile, obscene language known to man, then I would definitely suggest you look somewhere else for entertainment. Yet, if you happen to appreciate such sordid elements in your enjoyment of horror, then this film will provide you with a dark (I strongly emphasize dark), terrifying experience, guaranteed to provide you with nightmares about murders involving chainsaws for perhaps years to come. One element that really stood out in the film, and buoys my overall recommendation for "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" was the hilarious, delicious sinister performance of the always-welcome R. Lee Ermey, who perfects the role of a corrupt, violent sheriff stalking innocent prey to a tee; he is sensational in whatever role he plays, and definitely saves the film from being too unpleasant to be enjoyed. One of the most violent and uncompromising films I have ever seen, "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is one dark, grotesque gore-fest, and perfect for a nightly October viewing if you're in the market for dark, sadistic horror to satisfy a dark, sadistic appetite.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story has dramatically been redone, but it works very well. In fact, this remake is better than the original.Pros:1. The brutal scene with the sheriff and the gun in the van. Darkest part of the movie. The light on the sheriff's eyes is perfect. 2. That kid from The Ring does a good job as the weird little boy. 3. The family. Rather than just a father, a brother, and a half dead grandpa, we have a whole mess of inbred freaks! Yay! 4. The hitchhiker. No, not the weird hitchhiker in the first, but...well see for yourself. 5. Less manic screaming. That whole dinner table scene was...too "seventies." 6. Chainsaw Mania!Cons:1. There's just not enough Leatherface in this one. And you never get a good shot of him in the light. I suppose this adds to the suspense but... 2. They should've had the old grandpa. That was one of the creepy highlights of the original. 3. I kind of wished they had used the exact characters in this one. There's no whining disabled Frank and the hippie with the glasses isn't there. I did like the stoned dude in the glasses though.The original was scary due in part to it's age, but this one was just scary. It's a brutal grisly movie with lot's of gross stuff, even little things that just make you go "uuuh!" This is what the word horror means.</fullReview>

When the kids want to report this they find themselves victim of the oh-so familiar hillbillies we know from the original. Will at least one of them make it alive until the end?The makers of this know what the audience likes these days, so the atmosphere is darker than in the original and you just know Biel's t-short ain't gonna keep it dry all the time. Yes, indeed, it's all sex and violence these days.Still, there's nothing wrong with that. An enjoyable movie that should wipe out the nasty memory the Zellweger project had left. Perhaps except the last 30 minutes or so when there's just not that much going on anymore.5/10.</fullReview>

However, though this does fall in the same category, this stands out prominently making it unique and a HUUUUUGE exception.!!!!!! A freaky movie after sucha loooong time- it was amazingly directed, that it can without doubt classifies itself as this decades Exorcist. Being inspired by a true story is the freakiest icing on the cake. After a long time was i able to enjoy a movie of the horror genre, without thinking being very disappointed at the direction it was taking.Jessica Biel gives an amazing performance as Erin - one of the teenager's enjoying summer vacation. Her heavy expiration, which can be heard through the latter part of the movie, makes it a hair raiser. I believe this movie was gifted with a great sense of suspense, which was not present in all the other thrillers i have seen.All in all i believe this stands in front of the line with 'The exorcist' and i believe it was one of the scariest movies i have ever seen!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Character!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Classic horror movie! It had everything. I have to wonder if this movie has put anyone off going to Texas. I know it's made me think twice about it if I ever get the chance. The best part of the movie is Leather Face the chainsaw murderer. It's such a great horror character. It's perfect. I think they should have made Freddy vs Jason, Jason vs Leather Face. It would have made for some incredible fights where. The way that Leather Face is an actual person in the movie though, that just completes it. The whole family are pretty scary though. Also another thing they did right was they didn't put any big stars in the movie because I always find it a lot more scary when all the actors are nobodies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame sequel. Sadistic doesn't mean horrific, take note.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) is a terrible film. Unlike the recent remake of Dawn of the Dead (which was good), the new T.C.M. is it's polar opposite (it is bad). I don't know why they even bothered with remaking this classic. Everything that made the original great is missing. Sadistic does not equate frightening or scary it's just stomach churning. The film makers need to take note. The only thing worth while about this flick is Jessica Biel. If you're a huge Jessica Biel fan (and what straight male isn't) then this one is for you. But even her presence isn't worth sitting through this masochistic mess. They tried too hard. Yes, they tried too hard to be scary and they tried too hard to be cool and hip. They failed miserably. Skip this picture and watch T.C.M the original and it's campy sequel. Avoid at all cost, unless you're a Jessica Biel fan. But remember curiosity killed the cat! Jessica Biel is the second hottest actress to sport a cowboy hat. Check out Myra Breckinridge, Raquel Welch raised the bar with her cowgirl outfit. But it's another film that's takes some stones to watch because it's just as unwatchable as this mess.Not recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THIS MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS!!!In my personal beliefs this was one of the scariest movies that I had ever seen! It was so intense. A lot of "scary" movies aren't scary at all. This one was. Marcus Nispel decided to remake the original Tony Hooper cult classic. I am very glad that he did!The new "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" kicks the butt of the old "Texas Chainsaw Massacre". In the old "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" there was a lot of stupid material towards the end, such as all of the zoom ins on the eyes and face which in large part made the movie so disturbing.In the remake there are several good actors and actresses. The real standout being Jessica Beil. In the movie a group of young friends nearly hit a disturbed young woman walking along an abandoned Texas road. So they pick her up. Once they resume on their journey the young woman begins to ramble. She looks out the windshield and sees they are going back towards the Heweitt Farm where she had just escaped Leatherface. This is when she begins exclaiming "you're going the wrong way" and she jumps across the seat to try to stop Kemper from going back this way. The girl realizes he isn't going to turn around and pulls a gun out from between her blood soaked legs. She puts the gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger blowing her brains everywhere. From this point on things begin to spiral out of control as Leatherface kills each of the innocent teenagers. this movie was very scary and if i were you I'd rent it, or better yet buy it!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good movie when not compared to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, we horror fans should have known, someone at some point would do a remake of Toby Harper's 1974 classic. The mere thought of it made my eyes do a 360. This film however, I painfully admit is good. It is nothing in the genre of its original, it has more of a Blair Witch Project meets Joyride feel to it. It is scary, bloody but not disturbing. It is definitely geared towards teenagers though this mid thirties viewer enjoyed. The acting, dialogue and character set up are excellent. Leatherface is in control here. He doesn't swing the chainsaw wildly screaming insanely in an out of control way. He is more focused, determined, and hungry for a new face. The hillbilly family are extremely weird. The young teenagers are dopey, bickering and stoned as usual. The landscape excellent and farmhouse nice and spooky. The special features on the dv d are well worth watching. The only way to enjoy this is to not compare it to its original. It's different so it can be held to different standards. Had it not had been for the original, this movie would have become a classic. However, because of its name, it'll always be a remake, despised by some, enjoyed by others. I far prefer the original anytime, but this is not an insult like Psycho-1998.This is a fun movie to watch - period.</fullReview>

Simply 'horror' for unenlightened, easily-pleased adolescents.If this was supposed to be a 'remake' or, evils of evils, a 're-imagining' then why did it not have anything remotely horrific about it. Its Scooby Doo meets Leatherface. The fact it was supposed to be set in the early 1970s was totally lost on me...the characters didn't remotely resemble a '70s' look...the whole feel of the film screamed 21st Century...and when the only entertaining (or indeed jolting) moment of the film occurs in the final 60 seconds, then this is truly multiplex fodder of the lowest order.In short...when there is no more room for originality in hell, the re-imaginings shall walk the earth...be afraid, be very afraid!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad remake of a horror classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most have seen the original 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' mostly because it was (and probably still is) one of the grossest, vilest movies ever made. Is the story not only disturbing but the original was horrific. It has never been my cup of tea but I can understand why so many loved it.This sorry attempt at revamping the original is pretty bad. You can't blame it on the actors though, there's only so much acting someone can do between loud screams and running away from the bad guy. Sadly, this wasn't just bad acting but it was a crummy story to boot. At least with a good story, you can still have some fun. This was a slow, sad attempt at remaking a classic. There was nothing salvageable in this movie PLUS it didn't even make me jump. So much for scary.4/10 a bad attempt at an already bad movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An OK teeny slasher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thankfully I had no great expectations when I saw this. I've seen the original ages ago, don't remember much about it except the scene where one of the characters tries to escape the house and runs into an endless amount of sheets hung out to dry while Leatherface rips into them with his chainsaw just a few yards behind. That scene was included in this version, too, unlike the one where grandpa tries to bash the heroine's skull.This remake is an OK popcorn slasher, nowhere near as shocking or important as the original. Thankfully it doesn't even try to match the original, because the results would almost certainly have been completely ridiculous.Among the highlights: Jessica Biehl in Daisy Dukes and a tight top, and the psychotic drill instructor from Full Metal Jacket as the town sheriff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better slasher flicks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just for some background info, I'm a 44-year-old father of three who has a fairly eclectic taste in movies. I've enjoyed movies from nearly every genre, have liked some that critics panned, and have hated some that critics loved. Point being, I think I have enough intelligence and movie-watching experience to fairly rate a film. That said, this movie was a pleasant surprise. It was definitely one of the better "slasher" flicks I've seen. I thought the acting was excellent, and felt the film wasn't nearly as illogical as others in this category normally are. In particular, I enjoyed the fact that the killer actually ran after his victims. These movies often feature a deranged freak walking after a sprinting victim, only to catch him/her in the end. Sure, you could find nitpicks, but you can do that with nearly any movie in any genre. And if nothing else, for us heterosexual males, Jessica Biel is very easy on the eyes, and she's in nearly every scene.I didn't see the original "Chainsaw Massacre," so I can't compare the two, but if you're looking for a mindless rental that you'll have a good time watching, I think this one should fit the bill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthwhile Reworking of a Modern Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is a remake of what I consider to be the greatest horror film of all time. So, when I first saw this at the theater, I was a little skeptical going in. The film begins with some crime footage and a fabricated backstory on the supposed crime, and then we cut to some teenagers driving through Texas with half a pound of marijuana in their car. They pick up a disoriented girl on the side of the road, and she ultimately shoots herself in their car. Puzzled and scared, they head into a small town and are directed to an old mills to meet up with the sheriff. Of course, the sheriff doesn't show. From there they are directed to an old farmhouse in the countryside by a little boy playing around at the mill, so they can phone the sheriff. Little do they know, the farmhouse homes a family of psychos, led by the chainsaw-wielding maniac, Leatherface.With all things considered, this movie really wasn't bad. The story is completely reworked from the original and the story is much different from the original (besides a handful of things they share in common), but I enjoyed it. The psychotic family in this movie is much different and more elaborate than the three-man clan from the '74 version, but I didn't mind it and it worked in this movie. And the bloodletting and brutality in this film is pretty high compared to the surprisingly low blood-content of the original. This remake does manage to dodge most of the dreaded horror movie clichés, although they are a few moments that were leaning towards it, but nothing serious. The film has some great moments in it that were very well directed (especially the van scene with Pepper and Erin, and the clever pan through the hitchhiker's head) and they were very stylishly done. The film reeks with style actually, but strays away from the gritty documentary-feel that the original had. This remake is far from that, it's much more dark, moody, and glossy, but I can understand why the filmmakers would want to try something new with it. But, since the raw, gritty texture isn't here, I didn't find the film nearly as scary. The acting was good, the teens in this film were played by up-and-coming young stars, which isn't surprising. They all gave pretty good performances though.Overall, "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is a pretty well-done movie. While it doesn't come close to reaching the disturbing nature and hysteria of the original version, for a modern horror film, it's pretty good. Definitely worth watching, although I'm positive that the majority of the fans of the original will hold a grudge against this. As for me, I accept these remakes, and while some of them are pretty awful, this is probably one of the better ones you'll find. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'None Shall Pass!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Monty Python and the Holy Grail'. King Arthur vs The Black Knight. 'None shall pass!' Remember that? That's the last time I remember slapstick levels of comedy limb-lopping before seeing the remake of 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre'Before I go any further I'm not a knee-jerk 'the original is always better' type. I saw the originals of 'Dawn of The Dead' and 'The Ring' long before the remakes and yet late into a long pub session I have been known to admit I prefer the remakes (I like the hint of political satire in the new Dawn and the creepy sub-plot involving horses in the American Ring)So the new TCM is crap? Well no ? if you've not seen the original and don't care it might well be terrifying. Its certainly very uncomfortable viewing. All the implied violence, gore, torture and abuse hinted at in the original movie without ever being seen is dragged out endlessly before your eyes in the new version. And it has none of the originals crazy humour that gives even a hint of sympathy to the rural family.In fact you've no sympathy for anyone. The incredibly fit, thin, spotless (in the 70's?) tourists face off against the genetically degenerate locals with an almost Nazi level of attention paid to the physical differences between the two (no sign of the irritating tourist in the wheelchair from the original ? in fact in the new version they're all just irritating). There are rampant levels of 'I'll just walk into the abandoned filthy meat factory on my own' stupidity and some silliness involving a dead body.Perhaps the daftest thing is the way chainsaws and even a hatchet perform almost like light sabres, not only severing limbs with ease but also cauterising the wounds instantly. No-one bleeds to death in this movie or goes into shock ? which is probably just as well as a realistic portrayal of the torture shown here would probably make it completely unwatchable.On the plus side its well directed, well acted and looks fantastic. The very end almost is up with the original and hints to the debt that 'Blair Witch Project' owes to it. Perhaps that's that real difference between the two ? The original TCM would make a great double bill with Blair Witch. The only move I can see the remake going with is 'Straw Dogs', and I guess if you are in a mood for pitiless torture and abuse with a rural twist it might make for an interesting evening?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch out for the guy with the wheeling chainsaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>spoilers. THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE is one of the most bizarre crimes in the history, making it a movie in the 70ties became quickly a huge success. This is the new version of the movie, and I really have to say; it isn't bad at all!Five youths driving threw Texas' backwoods after they've been getting drugs in Mexico. They pick up a disturbed and totally traumatized woman wondering on the road, she is talking disturbed before she shoots herself and blows her brains all over the car. Shaken by the suicide the five of them decides to seek help from the local citizens. Finding soon out that they're all psychotic. They soon realise that everything's from normal in this small place. Cause soon they've got a chainsaw-wheeling lunatic running after them, known as Leatherface.It's a very frightening story, and it's very entertaining and catchy too. THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE is excitingly correct, with a totally insane guy with a chainsaw running loose, the movie really kept me on the edge of the chair. Jessica Biel stars as beautiful Erin that was the only survivor from the terrible massacre, and she had to watch her friends get killed one by one. The movie starts fast and when tings really starts getting creepy the movie is, I think, a pretty good horror movie. Pretty brutal as it is, Leatherface's terrifying character steals off course the show, together with Biel's beauty. The excitement is huge, and I think it stands pretty good alone. STARS: 3-4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Horror Movie Of All Time! (MAJOR SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jessica Biel, Erica Leerhsen, Mike Vogel, Eirc Balfour, Jonathan Tucker, and R. Lee Ermey star in the remake of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre". I've seen a lot of remakes to horror movies, but this one tops them all! It has big scares and gore galore! Erin (Biel), Pepper (Leerhsen), Andy (Vogel), Kemper (Balfour), and Morgan (Tucker) are five college students passing through Texas to get to a rock concert. Suddenly, they run into a hitchhiker who blows her brains out in their van. The five friends call the sheriff (Ermey), who turns out to be one of the bad guys. I'm not going to tell you what happens because you probably already know...Leatherface crashes out, kills the friends one by one, ETC. From the beginning to the middle, I was on the edge of my seat and biting my finger nails. I sat back in my seat towards the end because it was predictable. However, don't let the ending fool you! This movie is something else! The main reason why this is better is because there isn't any annoying cast members like the original! All in all, this is worth a rental. If you've rented the film already and you thought it was *OKAY*, I recommend you to buy the 2-Disk version of the film. It has tons of bonus features and it also has crime scene photos and a metal faceplate. I give this film a 10+/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a totally cool film. Now probably my favourite. Before I saw this film I thought that it would not compare to the first one. As I was so scared when I saw it. Although it looked dated for this day and age it was a classic. This film has brought the horror to a new age.The more complex story line makes it even more freaky and scary.I'm pretty annoyed that people are saying that this film is no good okay we all allowed options but anyone who thinks this is no good really has not watched it properly. Bloodest Part : Where Andy is hanging from the hook with his leg cut in half and leatherface puts salt on the end of it and ties it up with paper and string. Funniest part : Where the sheriff comes to take the body away. While he is wrapping the body up with Andy. Overall great film 10/10.

		<fullReview>I was never so bored in my life as I was in this 'film'. I had sworn off Hollywood made horror films for the past few years as they never delivered the goods, were not frightening, and ARE ALWAYS DERIVATIVE. My fiends convinced me to go, "this will be different" and "I've read some great things about it". I was actually BORED, (not quite as bored as in that piece of crap 'Wrong Turn'- I think it was called, but almost that bored).Anyway, the main reason I am writing this is that it is of concern how Hollywood is re-writing history. I was talking to some kids at uni who saw this abortion of a movie and took what was in it for fact. I have noticed this happening a lot lately (even highbrow films like 'Elizabeth' with Cate Blanchet are passed off as factual when they play fast and loose with the facts too). These kids think, as the movie states at the beginning, a bunch of kids were massacred by a chainsaw wielding maniac in Texas in 1974. I told them Ed Gein did his deed in the fifties, in Wisconsin, and he went about it in a much different way. The kids said, no, I'm wrong.. why would they change the facts. I said to make a (supposedly) better film. They walked away thinking I was wrong. I've read books on Ed Gein, they've seen a Hollywood film... this is the future.P.S I did like the recent remake of Dawn Of The Dead, so I'm not a purist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the biggest problems today is known actors/actresses who want to be in remakes of horror movies. Unless I hate the actor, I don't want to see them getting killed, plus they tend to ruin the "reality" of the situations.I have to relate this version of Texas Chainsaw on the same level of badness as Jaws the Revenge. It just seems so fake! Why can't some directors take the hint that less is more, and suggested gore and violence can be a lot scarier than seeing a hole through a girl's head. I found myself yawning during the movie and decided to play poker online instead. Stay away from this one, especially if you're a true fan of the original movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the movie on DVD and it was probably not the original version, because I haven't seen all that gore and body parts others are writing about, but if a horror movie is good it really does not need such things. Well the first 20 minutes of the movie are such annoying. The kids pick up a disturbed girl who than shots herself in their car. My opinion is that a movie should kind of build a solid contact to the pop corn eater in order to get him amused and interested within the first part of the movie. Well this one really fails to do this. But it really includes several scenes that seem to be very original, and put a smile on my face when I see such scary clever done stuff! For instance the old man knocking on the ground saying: He is already dead, he just doesn't know! The chase in between the rags in the garden and the scene in the camping car are very scary and original! But the acting is very bad I think! The only person that accomplishes this task quite well is Jessica Biel who is thanks to god the heroine of the movie. Forget the others they really are bad! Well the ending of the movie is a bit strange and I really expected something better and more interesting. Because this is just another get somewhere, where are we? oopsss I am killed, oh no, get out of here movies! Nothing really new so, I will not recommend it to anybody!It gets a 3.5 from 10 possible from me, but this is only my opinion!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The new Texas Chainsaw Massacre...terrifying? Not really.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new 2003 "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" was a not terrible movie, but it still got, and deserved, a 3. It was once said by a movie critic that "without his mask, Jason Vourhees would cease to exist". This goes the same for Leatherface. SPOILER NOTICE. SPOILER NOTICE. SPOILER NOTICE. About halfway through, the filmmakers had Leatherface take off his mask, and from then on in, the movie was ruined for me. Leatherface also, and this was my favorite, could run through a door ( in Bruce Lee fashion), while wielding his chainsaw, and how the camera slowed down to show the affect of this move, also sucked. And just the way the teens would end up in a new place in a matter of a frame confused me. Now this is not a complete loss, the acting was decent, and the film has a impressive amount of surprises, and the Leatherface costume still scares the bajesus out of me. But all in all, the movie is, sadly, not as good as Tobe Hooper's 1974 version which is a classic, and if you haven't, I strongly suggest you see it. All in all, the 2003 "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is a letdown. Thanks for reading my review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre Massacre'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cringe when I think of remakes, these days, and no genre prompts more cringing than the horror genre. Maybe I'm old fashioned and just don't think anything done well needs to be done again. Maybe I'm starving for original voices, or at least, respectful reincarnations. With that said, I did not much care for the new TCM. In all fairness, if for some reason the 90210 generation felt they needed a more contemporary version to suit them, then they have received it. And that's OK. Just a warning to those who esteem the old stock 70's horror films--this is a severe modern departure. It doesn't go quite so far as Freddy vs. Jason, but the production does seem to use the patented 'you already know the monster so it's just going to do it's thing and you will watch it' angle, refusing to add anything new or unique except for more vibrant colors and a little skin. If you want a legitimate remake, watch Dawn of the Dead. What helps that to work is that they took the original premise, tailored the 'zombie threat' to make it still appear as a threat, but kept the core story of personality conflicts in the midst of large scale disaster. But this isn't a review of DOTD...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always wanted to see a remake of this movie. I like the fact that the gore can be so much more with new movie effects. And I think you really do have to somewhat go over the top to make these remakes effective. The reason is because you cannot quite recapture the feeling of watching the original and having the story unfold before you. I definitely needed to see naked women getting butchered. If I am going to watch a remake, gratuity in all it's forms are necessary. I think they were a little too subtle about the relation between the barbecue and the people being butchered. If I recall it was pretty clear in the original that the barbecue had some "special" ingredients. This movie has definitely made me want to go back and watch the original again when I really wanted it to make me forget about old one and watch this one again. However, I give it grudging approval to be seen at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shut off your brain?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I just read a review on the pointless reworking of Tobe Hooper's classic drive in flick Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The reviewer implied that anyone who is not disturbed by the film or scared by the film is lying, however, I disagree. Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) is a perfect example of what is wrong with Hollywood. You take a film that was a success thirty years ago, put in a hot actress (Jessica Biel) crank the gore up 100 notches and who really cares if your story makes sense or no. This Texas Massacre begins with a group of "cool" kids on their way to a Lynard Skinnard concert. Now no kids would like Lynard Skinnard even in 1974, so this is just an excuse to license "Sweet Home Alabama." See, we have a popular song! This is WAY better than the original film. I'm not sure who the director is, or what he's done before, but Quentin Tarrentino he aint! I suspect this particular director came from the land of music videos, as not five minutes of the film is coherent, much less consistent (grandpa wants the kids to use the phone, he doesn't want the kids to use the phone, who cares?) Images fly by with the ferocity of a violent Nsync video on MTV. Lets talk about Leatherface. The mofo has no nose in the new film (no wonder he's so angry!) You can tell the director had probably watched Friday the 13th when they talk of Leatherface and his being ridiculed by his peers as a child. I forget who the woman was that filled in this piece of information, but let's just call her Mrs. Voorhees for now. All in all, Texas 2k3 wishes it could be House of 1000 Corpses much less on the same caliber as the original Texas film. Anyone who disagrees with the assessment that the original film is better is either living in denial or they are the type that would put style over substance. I wonder if these reviewers liked the 1998 Psycho...dude it's in color and the sister has a walkman...it kills Hitchcock's version! (Anne Heche as Marion Crane? We go from the babelicious Janet Leigh to Anne freakin' Heche?) By the way, NEVER SHUT YOUR BRAIN OFF FOR ANY FILM. If you do Hollywood will give you brainless crap like Hellboy, Van Helsing, and Riddick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Molding the original to the Current Horror Stereo-Type</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a well adapted script. It tried to link the original with its sequel. I have never seen part 2, but from what I gather this it fills in holes from the original. It holds weight with the classic landscapes and house shots - meat hooks and such. It was brushed with a Hollywood HairMousse and styling gel, but it remained true to the rust colored down home hick smoke flavored beef jerkey sustenance the original held. I am still afraid of Texas, this movie only furthers it.It was more fleshed out - no pun intended. There was a PHAT scene when leather face decides to change faces, I don't know if that's in the sequel - but DAMN!!! I got the chills. The plot built up in a more H-Wood sequence. The original holds weight because it is rather slow, methodic, mellow and gradual at the beginning. It really doesn't get completely disgusting, vulgar, and spectacular til the creepy end, then a short action sequence - she escapes. This movie held its weight as molding to the action movie mold where things always go wrong, everything gets worse synopsis. It's a different brush on an old subject - not the original, but it has merit by way of Blair Witch Folk Lore style horror films. I found it ironic how the creators of 'Blair Witch' were inspired by the original TCM, yet the remake relies on successful aspects and elements of 'Blair Witch.' Nice spin by M. Bay, overall not a bad rental or Halloween movie. Just a little too flashy for me to buy, the original definitely holds true to its merit, it is a movie you throw on when you want to go on a diet, as in, you lose your appetite for a month. The remake is more a gory horror classic, five teens surrounded by imminent doom - all die except one who escapes - type thing.BOTTOM LINE: If you've seen the original, watch it openly as a new movie, not a remake. If not, watch the original first. And don't feel obliged to follow up with the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AMAZING and impeccably photographed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the scariest movie I have ever seen. Scarier than The Excorcist, the original TCM, and the photography is beautiful. Jessica Biehl rocked. Don't understand the generally awful reviews this movie got from critics, and its average rating here. Stunning. The first 10 minutes are relentless, R. Lee Ermey is scary as anything, kind of campy, but truly memorable. I have never jumped this much watching a film, and I my heart was beating a mile a minute. SPOILER!!! The only part of the film that I questioned was the end with the baby. After what Jessica had done in that car, it was laughable when they showed the little baby calm and happy as ever. In fact it was ludicrous. All in all a fantastic rollercoaster ride of a film. And so much better than the original. 9 out of 10 for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'll never forgot Nispel now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching movies is my hobby , but I'm being impressed by a movie rarely. This movie I couldn't watch indifferently. I'm not admiring violence, but I respect this movie for its meaning. It teaches justice, as the events shown in it are too unjust. In particular. The part when leatherface saws the door to get out is very nice. And this is the first moment you really feel sorry for the young guy who's left with one leg. He was too fair to realize they can't leave their friend, but not enough fast to run away. The film in general is A+. The most remained firmly in memory parts are - the chainsaw rotating on the floor with the maniac's cut off hand `holding' it, `leather' is running after Erin through the `tunnel' with the saw,Erin `steals' the baby girl(a cute child) and then kills the sheriff with his own car. Now she's driving away. At this moment a lot of you might think the `leatherface' will come out from the back seat, but no. He's standing on the road with his saw eager to cut the `nasty' girl but he just manages to scratch the car(this part is good either). Thanks god! One of the main roles in the movie plays its edition, it's done great. I'll never forget the name "Marcus Nispel" now, because his work is one of the best things I saw in my life. I think that as a director he managed to do the simple things that almost everybody forgot nowadays to show on the screen - to make the audience feel compassion to the victims. The characters are `built' right. Of course it's not only the director's worth. The costume designer did his best. The most touching scenes are - when Erin(Jessica Biel) has to stab Andy (with cut leg) to save him from the further sufferings, and the young guy at the sheriff's car back seat (in tears) offering their concert tickets and receives a bottle in his face... Comparison to classic: I love this one as the very first 70's `Texas chainsaw' by Tobe Hooper. I agree Tobe's version is a classic, and I respect that director. But 2003 version is perfect itself. Some say this remake's bad. And I say it's because we always think that the story is best told the first time. It's right, but there are some exceptions to the rule. And let's admit the guys really worked hard. I'm so grateful to the producers for the time and money they spend on this movie. I want to mention Jessica Biel's acting was brilliant. I don't say I disliked the others. They're all good and I would enjoy watching them in other movies, but Jessica . she's special. Every time she cries here you want to cry too. R. Lee Ermey - what can I say? I remember him from "Hexed" - I think nobody would ask for being run over better than he did - excellent actor. That scene makes you feel rather comfortable. After all, he did a lot of "bad things". Especially I liked the scenes of Mr. Leatherface's first appearance (when the invalid old man knocks on the floor a couple of times) and Jessica cutting the Leatherface's hand off. The chainsaw sound effects are done on the highest level. That noise is still in my head. Plus the right atmosphere(thanks to production designer) is enough not to forget this movie. Even if you're not much fond of horrors, you'll enjoy this one, because it begins and ends from and in the right place. I've enumerated almost all the episodes that are still being played in my head, but the most important in this movie is the moral. Just like the first `massacre' it's too smart to be called just a `horror movie', it banishes the evil and develops the sense of kindness(it'll sound trivially), and in this time of cruelty and wars we need this kind of films to remember what the humanity is. Unfortunately, in last ten years a lot of movie-making general rules have been changed. A lot of films are shot too lifeless. Well, Marcus Nispel did everything here another way, that's why I love this movie, and don't just like it. Sincere movie is always the best. A vivid example of how movies must be shot. Brilliant result! As I said I don't admire violence, but I love tis movie. Regards, Hakob.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was what I now call "a predictable slasher film", especially if you've seen the first film. This movie is almost on the point of being boring and tiresome and the scare tactics in this movie are only people moving in the shadows and sound. No, no, no, this is a horror movie that should have been in the good old days because now films like this are for grade school kids who actually find movies such as The Godfather boring. The only reason I added points to this movie is because the people that made this movie almost remade the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre film and the end footage is a tad bit believable. But, another reason that some points were subtracted is because the characters and some of the plot are totally unbelievable. My overall score: 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even those who haven't seen a gajillion movies have a good idea of what to expect from a remake of an old horror movie (or the latest in a long-running horror series, for that matter). Our expectations are lowered at a rate proportional to the number of years since the first movie was produced. Using that logic, this remake of the 1974 ne plus ultra of low-budget gore from Tobe Hooper should be either an absolute laugh riot or a stunningly awful scare flick.But this 2003 remake isn't either of those. I was fully prepared to laugh out loud at inappropriate times (it's okay, it was in the privacy of my own apartment) and basically point and giggle at the bad dialogue and inept acting. But I hardly got the opportunity. Oh, sure, like most horror films this did have the occasional "what the heck are they doing?" moments, the sporadic lapses in logic. But for the most part, this is a well-told story with just the right amount of special effects (including blood and guts, of course). It's not a movie that throws every effect it can think of, drowning the viewer in coagulation (like the remake of The Haunting, or Freddy versus Jason, or the most recent Halloween movies). This movie relied on two main things: The storyline and the performances of the lead performers. How unhorror-like!At its heart, the story is pretty simple: A group of five kids, on the way to a Lynryd Skynyrd concert, stops to pick up a dazed young girl on the side of the road. She's not terribly coherent, and just a few minutes after they've resumed their journey she puts a gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger, producing a gaping hole in her head and in the rear window of the kids' van.So many horror movies begin this way, don't they? Now the kids have a dead girl in their van, so they bring her to the nearest town. And that's where the fun begins.It's been a long time since I saw the original TCM, but this movie seems to keep pretty close to the general storyline. Kids find creepy house, kids get slaughtered, one person survives... you know how it goes. The movie's presented as "what really happened" that fateful day in 1973, bookended by "real" film by police of the crime scene. Oh, and in a nifty touch, the narrator of the original has been brought back to narrate this one - the one and only John Larroquette, who was uncredited in the original.This remake was surprisingly well done, with quick pacing (Michael Bay was one of the producers), excellent atmosphere, some genuine frights and chills, and competent work by a game cast of mostly unknowns (Jessica Biel of TV's 7th Heaven was the only person I recognized).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(SOME SPOILERS AHEAD I THINK)Probably since I've been let down by a lot of "scary" movies like "The Ring," "Scream" 2 and "Jeepers Creepers" (which I also commented on) I wasn't expecting much out of this crap. And I was right. Okay, in the begining it starts out like Jeepers Creepers, with some teens in a car. And two of 'em make out out of some desperate attempt to send out some shock value (probably.) And fast forwarding....it's basically like the gay "Scream" sequels..some scary dude who just comes up and chops people to death. I know it's based on a true story, but so?? Look, I'm not saying this movie sucked, All I'm saying is don't expect to be scared. I wasn't. Maybe I set my standards to high or whatever, but this sh** wasn't scary to me. Like I said before, it didn't SUCK, but it wasn't horrifying, it has a pretty average plot and storyline. I heard folks saying this was one flick that was actually scary to them, so I gave it a chance, and f***, maybe it was to THEM, but it just didn't do it for me. I don't know how many times I have to say this. My rating 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Horror Movie Of The New Millennium</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm just as big a horror snob as the next guy. So when I went to see the remake of Tobe Hooper's classic (but severely outdated) 1973 film back in October, I had mixed feelings. I'm always skeptical about TV actors making the jump to the big screen in horror movies (look at the drivel brought forth to us courtesy of "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and the "Scream" sequels). But needless to say, within the first 10 minutes or so, all my worries were put to rest. I should have known better; New Line does not disappoint. The movie starts off very dead-pan and does not let up for a second. This movie will keep you glued to your seat (or it will make some people leave) for it's hour and forty-five minute run. The key to this movie's success, I believe, is all in the characters. The core cast, the five young adults, are completely human--flaws intact, well drawn out, and very likeable. The bad guys (Leatherface &amp; Co.) are truly bastards of the sickest form and you'll despise each one of them (the Sheriff still sends chills up my spine, great acting from the always wonder R. Lee Ermey). The story revolves around five young adults, on their way back from Mexico, carrying a pinata full of marijuana, to a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert (this movie takes place in '73 as well). When they pick up a suicidal hitch-hiker (almost the complete opposite of the original movie) their world's are turned completely upside down and matters only get worse. This movie is absolutely brutal. I have seen so many horror movies that I have been a bit desensitized to gore &amp; violence and what-not, but I was absolutely sucked into this movie. First time movie director Marcus Nispel (who spent many years directing music videos) presents us with a very professional, very moody and very terrifying movie. Yes, hang me for this if you must, I'm a big fan of the original, but this one completely squashes it. There is no slapstick in this one folks: This is the REAL Texas Chainsaw Massacre (incidentely, this movie is not a true story, it is loosely based on the Ed Gein murders). By far the best horror movie that has come out of the new millennium, and it completely blows all of the previous TCM sequels out of the water. Please understand what you are getting with this movie. Most of the critics gave this movie a bad rating for all the wrong reasons; Roger Ebert gave it zero-stars for not having any redeeming social value and for not making him feel sexy. Puh-lease, folks. We go to horror movies to be knocked off our feet and to be terrified and entertained for an hour and a half. "TCM 2003" does it's job gloriously. It's only fault may be that a whole new slew of potentially hap-hazard horror remakes are on their way. But as it stands, this is an incredible experience. They don't make 'em like this anymore!10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the remake quite a lot because it was so well made in terms of the setting and the mood. All the actors involved did their roles pretty good and the cinematography was beautiful in terms of getting the south down pack in a Norman Rockwell kind of way. The actors in this movie (Jessica Biel, Eric Balfour, and R, lee Ermey) did a believable job, and it does not make light of the violence that is on the screen. While it lacks the creepy atmosphere of the original movie, it's still a great movie in its own right. Director Marcus Nispel does a fine job keeping a tight ship, and his remake of the original is a great update of this horror classic. Hopefully, the same crew can do it again in the prequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.... Not that many other films have scared me as much through the years as this film has. I am talking, of course, about the original film on which this remake is based. That film has a an intensely claustrophobic and highly unpleasant feel to it that Marcus Nispel just can't recreate here. He tries, and at times he's close, but he's got no cigar. Cinematographer Daniel Pearl, on the other hand, does have one and he's smoking it quite heavily throughout the picture as it is absolutely gorgeous to look at. (in it's own way of course)Pearl reprises his crew-position from the original film without heavily overlapping what he's already done before. A lot have changed in terms of the plot of the film for this remake. So much so that it feels more like a sequel (Texas Chainsaw Massacre 5) than a straight forward remake. (Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003)) We have a complete set of new characters that for the most part feels out of place and era,(the fact that they've tossed Franklin is very noticeable) a bunch of scenes featuring predictable hide and seek action and a Leatherface now suffering from the same facial problems as Friday The 13th's Jason Voorhees. What's that about? I thought everybody knew by now that the more you explain, the less frightening it gets? We don't actually have to know why he's wearing other peoples´faces, do we? There is such a thing as imagination.The new family is more creepier than the one in the original and as with the blood and the gore; we now get more family for the same price. Additional and alternate members has been added, and at least one, or two of these feel as extras; as if they have no real purpose.It is evident from the very beginning of the film to the end that New Line went for the "more the merrier" concept with the 2003 version of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. As a result: More blood and gore, more screen-time for Leatherface, but less psychological terror and atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Listen when I first heard about the remake of TCM. I flipped out and decided not to see it. It sounded like the WB meets a horror movie. Well I was in the video store with only enough money to rent one movie. There was nothing that really caught my interest. So I saw a copy of Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) I picked it up and rented it. Then when I got home the horror began.The movie was a very stupid and idotic remake. It wasnt even a remake. Leatherface looked like crap and his real face was even worse that was some bad makeup. The bad guys were very likeable because they brought humor to the movie. The good guys were pointless cause you all knew what was going to happen. Jessica Biel was coming out alive and all the friends were going to get massacred. Jessica Biel also had alot of choices she could of taken to kill Leatherface. The little hillbilly kid was funny and he should of been bad but they ahd to have a good family member.The gore sucked there was not enough. The orignal made itself known for some good gore. The only part that made my body tingle. Was when the guy snapped his nails on the cement wall. That was too creepy for me. The salt on the cut off leg was great. I never had laughed so hard in years. As I said a paragraph above Leatherface real face was horrible the makeup really was bad. I think they spent more money on the actors then the makeup.Oh yea for the people that think that there was a real Thomas Hewitt then youre wrong. That was a actor in that tape at the end. The story was based on Ed Gein. He was a inspiration for alot of movies. Like Phycho/Norman Bates, Texas Chainsaw Massacre/Leatherface,Silence of the Lambs/Buffalo Bill,and many others.So if its a rainy day out and nothing is on. Dont rent this cause it will add to youre boreness. Go rent the orignal please. And Hollywood please NO MORE REMAKES THAT SUCK.Rated R for- Stupid cartoon like gore,language,and torture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am dubious of remakes I must admit, but as I do with any film I cast all pre-conceptions aside and viewed this film with an open mind ....and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.I loved the fact it wasnt bright, garish or glamourized(ie the characters werent all beautiful and enhanced) and that the film didnt rely heavily on gore or the slash factor or special effects as it so easily could have done.I found the movie refreshing obviously not in content but in how it was directed and carried out, it was well paced,thrilling and disturbing,on different levels and even four days after seeing this film i kept thinking about it...which in my mind a good film always provokes....most horror films of today i find disappointing, not very frightening and instantly forgettable-sticking to the same old formulas - of dumb ass,two dimensional cliched characters who you couldnt care less whether they live or die, corny jokes ,ludicrous deaths and predictably paced scares and outcomes.I felt satisfied that this film contained none of those bad elements...although in this film there is little time to get to know some of the characters due to circumstance .By the way in which the film was shot,paced,and the manner in which it was acted i really wanted the characters to get the hell out of there. I thought Jessica Biel was superb as Erin....she genuinly seemed terrified,distraught,shocked and determined to fight through-out the film for survival. I also felt Johnathon Tucker who played morgan was particularly good....especially in the scene involving his interrogation by the corrupt and sickeningly sadistic sherrif over the suicide of the hitch hiker .....i found it convincing and terrifying at his fear and hopelessness of the situation.The film wasnt as graphic in its murder scenes as it could have been which i think is commendable...yes it is still gory in parts but the suggestions of some of the characters- such as Pepper,kemper and morgans demises leaves much to the imagination which makes it disturbing.You get some insight into Leatherfaces motivations for the killings and the hint that there is so much more to the dysfunctional Hewitt clans lifestyle....and crimes than is shown eg I found it disturbing that they stole the child from the hitch hikers family after killing them all and that they display possessions and photographs from their victims as if they were their own.I recommend this film.....but dont compare this to the original,it seems a pointless exercise , as they are so different and were made in totally different times.</fullReview>

Then I rented it and called a few of my friends who haven't seen it and they did the exact same thing except two of them didn't come back.So why is that?? They didn't really show anything but cut off fingers, toes, and a face. I guess I don't have that much of a weak stomach...P.S. For those who still don't get it either-- THIS MOVIE WAS INSPIRED!! NOT BASED!! ED GEIN ONLY KILLED TWO WOMEN AND DUG UP SEVEN WOMEN'S BODIES AND MADE A "WOMAN SUIT". HE DID NOT GO AROUND WITH A CHAINSAW AND THERE WAS NO CANNIBALISTIC FAMILY!

		<fullReview>"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre(2003)", directed by Marcus Nispel and produced by acclaimed director Micheal Bay attempts to use the same formula as the original. Camera angles and setting were closely studied in an attempt to let older audiences relive the original and younger audiences experience the horror.TCM starts off with an eerie monologue to set the mood for the movie. After explaining the background story we meet the 6 teenagers who are on a summer vacation to Mexico seemingly to "score" dope. When they spot a hitchhiker and pick her up the nightmare begins..."Texas Chainsaw Massacre" will have you jumping and screaming until your heart is ready to explode. Superb acting by Jessica Biel, Jonathan Tucker, Erica Leerhsen, Mike Vogel, Eric Balfour and R. Lee Ermey should satisfy your horror movie tastebuds.I give TCM(2003) a 5 out of 5.</fullReview>

Nothing special here, our car load of teenagers run into some crazy unlikable redneck inbred isolated country town American family. This is a serious attempt at horror, because the story is feasible, and also because there isn't any comic relief like most of the other current horror movies out now. A few gory scenes, and some sudden frights make this a pleasure to watch.This review is based purely on the new version as I haven't seen the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre.2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing and effective but ultimately unfulfilling remake of the horror classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is an accepted fact that Tobe Hooper's 1974 film "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," is a horror classic. It was unique in that it was shot in no particular style (thus adding to its authenticity) and had a more documentary feel as opposed to the conventional elements of the average horror film. The 2003 remake does not have either of those, but it is not a failure either. I did not expect the new "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" to be good in any way but I was quite surprised. The new "Massacre" film abides by the traditional elements of modern MTV-stylized slasher flicks (ala "Scream") but adds new dimensions to a genre that is typically one-sided and empty. 2003's new "Massacre" is a film that as most remakes would have it, had a lot to live up to, and in some places it did, and others it did not. The new film is failed potential at best but it still works on the viewer; it DID get to me in some places.Nonetheless, this film like its 1974 predecessor, will shock the viewer by the macabre nature (people will ask themselves, "Is this really happening?"), moody atmosphere, and gore (artistically speaking, this is what made the original much more terrifying in that you never saw much splatter).There is much tension; the director Marcus Nispel actually comes close to matching the original film's Tobe Hooper in direction. The acting is not up to par but is at least believable and the actions of the characters are within common sense (though no more than that of most horror films).7 ? out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Well Done Horror Flick....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a well done Horror Flick. It has alot of horror and violence.It really scared me, because I jumped a few times. Jessica Biel did a excellent job as her character and I liked how she was acting.I am a really BIG fan of Horror Movies, and before I saw Texas Chainsaw Massacre I saw Wrong Turn. They are pretty similar and alike. In the part when they look around the house and they see body parts and pieces, well Wrong Turn has the same. But it does'nt matter to me. But although there are a few mistakes in the movie that I would say "that was stupid" and the parts when they try to add in some comedy, I don't like Horror Movies like that, but anyways The Texas Chainsaw Massacre kept me going and I was jumping up! As I said The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is "A Well Done Horror Flick" 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>if it weren't a remake, i might have liked it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why? What is Hollywood's obsession with remaking classics into modern, mediocre pieces of trash? Not that I'm a huge fan of the original TCM, but at least it was original and brimming with a claustrophobic tension. Sure, the remake is tense too, but not in the mysterious way that the original was. The original kept you scared by NOT showing you every gory detail. The new one is ALL ABOUT the gore, and it seems to have been made with the mathematical formula (more gore = scarier movie). There is a lot added to this new script that borderlines on ridiculous and does nothing but subtract from the scares. Oh, and Lee Ermey was one of the most BUNK-ASS casting decisions I've ever witnessed. He'll always be the drill sergeant and he'll never overcome that typecast. An unknown actor would have been much more effective. If you like horror movies it's still worth a rental though. Decent cinematography, decent (albeit typical) acting and casting, and lotsa jumpy moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very impressive remake that far surpasses the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original was highly disappointing. The remake is highly impressive. Leatherface actually SCARED me for the first time since I've been introduced to his character. With quite good cinematography and acting, the new Texas Chainsaw successfully scares and thrills. For a horror movie (one overshadowed by the expectations of fans of the original) the remake succeeds at achieving all that a horror movie should: to fascinate the audience with an interesting and plausible story line, to induce an occasional "Oh, my gosh!", and finally, to generate adrenaline flow and increase heart rates among its watchers. I was highly impressed with the remake's ability to stand alone from (while at the same time, yielding homage to) the original, and far surpass it in my personal opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>remakes are a strange bird</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ending Spoiler here! To remake a movie of such cult, iconic status is a noble and unwanted task by many, I'm sure. So, I give the director credit for wanting to tackle this particular movie and I also give him credit for not just rehashing the exact same movie because we've seen it already and now we're sick to death of it. But, they were some things in it, I thought didn't give this movie the same feel the original had. One, was we spend too much time with Leatherface, or Thomas Hewitt, whichever. This is a character that there is no justification for, yet we get all this dialouge and setup for someone we have no intention of caring for and it doesn't seem as scary when he shows up. Another thing about this film is there are too many characters and, spar the sheriff, were not really frightening at all and quite frankly were quite annoying. The little boy I didn't understand, just a plot to help them out. I also don't understand the whole plotline of the baby and the girl that shot herself. The Hewitts won't kill babies, but anybody else that comes near them they'll kill. In a way I understand because how disgusting is it to hurt an infant, but these people aren't really portrayed as the remorseful type. I did like the final ending of the film with the old police tape and Leather face being down there, but I hope they do not go with a sequel. That would be a true muderous blow to this series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VERY GOOD AND INTENSELY TERRIFYING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but I thought that the re-make was brilliant. It was extremely gory and I did wince in some of the scenes.If you are a horror fan then I would recommend this film, but don't watch it on a full stomach is my tip. I was impressed with some of the special effects in the gory scenes I thought they were very good and realistic.The actor whom played Leatherface was really realistic in the things that he performed in the film and when the chainsaw came out he was really terrifying with it because you did not know what he was going to do next or whom was going to be his next victim, so it was suspense as well.I would not mind seeing the original film just to see how close they kept to it, it should be interesting to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I took a look at this movie relatively excited. As a big horror fan, the previews looked great, and the original movies were the only classic horror series I hadn't seen- unfortunately, I laughed at this movie far more often than I even thought to be frightened. The characters are annoying, the storyline goes to nonsensical lengths to make a bad attempt to remain vague, and the absolutely moronic villain is a joke. From bad acting to goofy redneck lines to camera shots stolen from Orson Welles movies (running through a slatted hallway with lights through the slats, stolen from "The Trial"), this movie is great if you want a good laugh at a crappy horror movie. If not, look for something better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never had a chance to watch the original version of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but I guess I never be the fans for the old school slasher because I find many of them fail to satisfy me. Only the original Psycho and A Nightmare on Elm Street could amuse me.Actually I already know where is this movie goes to even before I watch the movie, but as a die-hard fans I cannot pass this. And this is another great package that you can get from the modern slasher. The tension is build well, the characters is full of the cliché but on the right mood, the gore is great and the plot is tolerable. Everything goes as it supposed to be, and I know it quite safe for the director and not so innovative, but at least this is still delivers. I know to make a comparison with the original are not a suitable justice to this movie, but I guess this is a lot better that the original and I certainly sure that Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a-must-see.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different from the original, but still good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard that the seminal 70s grindhouse classic, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, was being remade, I have to admit I was more than a little apprehensive. I mean, we're talking about a film whose reputation alone could cause people in polite society to gasp and become quite upset. So, when plans were announced for a remake, I was sitting here imagining another disaster of 'Psycho' proportions...However, I needn't have worried. Of course, being Hollywood-ized caused some of the gore to be left on the cutting room floor, (see the deleted scenes on the 2nd disc of the collector's edition dvd) and writer Kozar's original idea for an ending, well, yes I can see why it wasn't supported, although it certainly would have been quite an ending. However, it's still a pretty no-holds-barred film for all of that.The plot changes are fun, and make the film interesting for those of us who are students of the original, we aren't sure what we're going to get, same as all the newbies. The cast is roundly good, from all the kids to the amazing R. Lee Ermey. The cinematography, provided by original TCM DP Daniel Pearl, is incredible. All in all, whether you're a fan of the original, or you've never seen it, it's worth giving this new vision of TCM a shot.Well, that is, if you think you can stomach it. I mean, when I said there was some gore left on the cutting room floor, I by all means meant all of it was there. This is still a very visceral film by normal standards, and certainly by the standards of anyone who is only a casual viewer of horror films. Just a warning. This isn't your typical 'Freddy Vs. Jason' kind of film. The violence doesn't happen like that. And it's not really 'funny'. So if you're expecting any of those things, look elsewhere. If you want a good, scary, visceral horror movie, the kind of thing we haven't seen for a while, then definately check this out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I ask from a horror film is to truly scare me..or at the least keep me interested. This remake of the original masterpiece was not nearly as bad to me as it's reputation. It really had me going. I stayed on the edge of my seat the whole time and that's a plus when you consider the film is a remake. To my pleasant surprise this film doesn't ride the coattails of the original and instead explores new themes. The director focuses in on atmosphere creating a disturbing look on americana. You look at the farm landscape differently. It brings out this theme in many ways like the original,yet produces new thrills. I was also quite impressed with Jessica Biels. She has the right amount of fear without going into overacting. The film is also quite disturbing and frightening. I was hooked on it and really had a scary time. I will say that we have to keep in mind that the film is still a remake. That being said,I have to doc at least a star because the film borrows from someone else's vision. I will finish by saying that this film is very violent and quite thought provoking. I believe the makers accomplished what they set out to do. ****/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie does an excellent job of putting a new spin on an already classic movie. In the new film, Leatherface is a maniac due to years of torment as well as a nasty facial deformity. Also, his family, while still extremely deranged and insane, don't appear to be cannibals. The sheriff is an incredible character in this film and only adds to the horror and suspense created by Leatherface. The plotline is also different in the fact that the kids aren't there to see graverobbers but rather are forced there by a girl they pick up on the road who so rudely blows her brains out in the back of their van. After this it is all downhill for those kids. The varied plotline from the original worked out well and with the availablity of gory special effects, added to the gruesomeness of the film. While many may argue with me, I have seen both and I enjoyed the new one more. They are both great movies, but the remake made the whole story seem believable and it was scary as hell. Not only that, who doesn't want to see Jessica Biel running for her life in minimal clothing? I know I do!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who else thought that this movie was a half-assed remake?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was just wondering because I thought that it was a terribly done remake of the first movie. Blood was used so freely and many of the deaths were just comical, they weren't gritty like the original. Do you remember the original meat hook scene, I still have a hard time seeing that girl with the exposed back in the original after seeing that movie. The hook in that movie is so grotesque. In this it is secondary as there are two prongs on the hook. I think that was the worst part because anyone that has taken basic physics knows that when you double that amount of normal forces to hold up an object you lessen the amount of force exerted on the body itself. So one of my favorite scenes is used in a terrible way.I was mainly disappointed in how the characters were killed in the end of the movie. I know that they were trying to stick as close to the original (Yeah right!) but my absolute favorite scene in the original was when Franklin was killed with the chainsaw. The utilization of the chainsaw was another thing that irritated me. In the original the chainsaw was a utility tool. It was useful to Leatherface to cut through bone without much effort. It was also evident that it was because of utility as Leatherface used it in less that half of the killings in the original. However, in this new age remake, which is more of an homage to scream than the original TCM, Leatherface wields his chainsaw like he's using a broad sword.To me, a fan of the original TCM, I am appalled by this terrible rehash of the movie that I so thoroughly enjoyed seeing the first time. Any of you Benedict Arnolds that think that this remake is good and you have seen the TCM (1974) should be ashamed of yourself. I hope this doesn't become a trend for Hollywood directors. What next, a remake of Die Hard? This time with Iraqi terrorists, and we'll set it in New York. And obviously we need to put some heartthrob like James Vanderbeek as John McClane and Angelina Jolie as Holly. Haven't you Hollywood bigwigs figured out that you can't just shovel this filth to us, the consumer or we'll just say, "Screw the movies!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pull the rocks out and get ready to throw them at me when I say that I thought the original TCM was a great film, it was, 20 years ago. It's not great by many standards of todays films, but that doesn't mean it's not, or wasn't a really good film. The "heroine" in the original film was terrorized for about 40 minutes in the original, constantly screaming while 5 family members danced and screamed and sang and yelled and acted completely freaking wacko around her, for 20 or so minutes she was gagged and bound to a chain and her her hands nailed to the arms. THAT is postitively disturbing.**POSSIBLE SPOILER** (If there is such a thing with this film) The only thing that disturbed me about this remake is that Leatherface dropped his chainsaw not once, not twice, but, oh yes friends and neighbours, count 'em, THREE times, and NOT ONCE did ANYONE think to PICK IT UP. Please, the first two I can deal with but in one of the climactic scenes Leatherface is completely occupied by an assailant, drops the saw and Jessica Biel still refuses to pick the damn thing up. Yeah, sure, Leatherface had a foot on her back, but he took it off long enough for her to stand up and get away.This film had very little class, very little inventiveness, the bad guys were WAY too nice (sure the sherrif was pr*ck, but you should meet by next door neighbour). I didn't even know the characters names, I cared for them so little.The closest this film came to nasty (which is what TCM is all about) is where the hitching girl at the start pulled that gun from. At a glance it would even seem that Leatherface was putting salt all over the first guys wound to be mean, but it was only to seal the wound to make for good eating later.However, it's not as bad as Cabin Fever.I give it 1.5 out of 5, 2.5 if you watch it with Cabin Fever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's the matter Hollywood? Is it too hard to think up anything original these days, or is it simply not worth the effort considering everyone will come see a remake or an unneeded sequel these days? Well, if it's the latter, then you're right. I fell victim to this one as well and actually paid money to see this piece...thinking maybe, just maybe, it might be original enough to carry the name. Wrong.Acting...terrible. Some of the worst. Where did they get these tools anyway? Stick to commercials guys. Scary? Pfft, yeah right. Just wait for the silence in any of the chases and you'll see them coming right away, and embarrassingly so. I can't understand how anyone could be scared by this film, unless they've just received a lobotomy, have never seen a movie before, and are recovering agoraphobia.Not only that, they couldn't even stick to the original story. The family's involvement in the horrors are all but left out. And what do we have to replace it with? A 45 minute chase scene in which we are forced to realize the fact that Leatherface is a big wuss and can't even catch some dumb girl who feels it's safe to stop every 5 minutes or so while a madman with a chainsaw is chasing her. Wimp. I'd be much more scary and formidable given a gas-powered, flesh eating tool and a motive for a murderous rampage.R. Lee Emery is the only person who's character has some redeeming qualities to it as to even look forward to. It's not Full Metal Jacket, but he plays a good part. Did it entertain me? Yes?.but then again, any movie with a 45 minute chase scene featuring a half naked woman will entertain any man. Is it a good film? Hell no. But I will admit, there was one part that made me laugh, unintentionally of course. Leatherface's new mask.If you enjoyed Halloween:H20?then this is right up your alley.As some witty reviewer once referred to it, I give 'Tanktop' a 4/10.</fullReview>

The movie transitioned very well from one scene to another. It was everything I expected it to be. I hope they will not make a part 2 to this film because IT'S BEEN DONE before. There has been more then 5 "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" films. I do not think I or anyone else could handle another film. New Line Cinema is getting better at making horror films for example "Freddy Vs. Jason" was a blockbuster hit bringing in 86 mill. If New Line Cinema wants to stay in business they will not make a part 2 to this film. Overall this movie gets a 5/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" When you hear that you imidately think cheap, gorey, bad acting. Thats what you see in the original film made in 1974. When I sat down to watch the original for the first time i was stunned at how boring and uneventful it was. So of course when the new one came out I didnt plan on seeing it. But as the days went on and the commercials and trailers continued to play, I became curious as to weather this remake would be another cheapo attempt to scare little children, or if it would be a full on horror film. So I decided to get together a couple of friends and it was off to the theater. When we first sat down i wondered if it was a bad idea, and if I would have to sit through a piece of crap like the first time. But when the movie began I was once again stunned. Not only was it interesting, and scary beyond belief, It actually made sense, and was realistic. I was sucked in and found myself in tears at one point because I was so terrified. One of my friends was forced to leave the theater because she was so scared she couldnt catch her breath. I suggest this strongly to anyone who loves horror flicks, and it up for a good scare. rateing..... 1-10(1 worst 10 best) I give it a ********* (9)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never thought that a remake of TCSM might work, but the trailer was so well done that I actually looked forward to seeing it. The result is, however, a total disaster. This movie lacks suspense, terror and athomosphere and tries to make up for it with massive amounts of gore (which ironically is missing in the original version) and shiny music video pictures. The sets look like movie sets, everything is so carfully and stylishly run down and gritty that it simply does not look real.The direction is poor, there is no obvious structure to the individual scenes, as if the director was not even trying to create suspense. Not even the cheap scares are effective. The writing is also less than wonderful, they should have stayed closer to the original script. None of the changes add anything to the story, they feel like cheap gimmicks. As if that wasn't bad enough, the movie was boring. Simply boring. The only redeeming feature is Jessica Biel in a tight top.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whatever the hell it is, there was no way it was going to be as effective as the original because the original is a creature of its era in addition to being THE terror yardstick.Still, this huge TEXAS CHAINSAW fan was not disappointed.I like my horror brutal and unrelenting and somewhat stylish. This remake is all those things.Leatherface's character is mentally and physically fleshed out (a little) here and his extended family is enlarged.Original DOP Daniel Pearl shot this remake and he does a knock-up job. The print appears to be bleach by-passed and the lighting style favours kicks and edgelights. It looks really interesting. Not a lot of color, but particular colors when necessary.I didn't buy that the film is set in the 70's because the characters look too "now", but that's a minor quibble. I wasn't happy to see that Franklin had been replaced by a non-wheelchair-bound dweeb, either, but I was willing to ride with the parade.Leatherface's first appearance, where he smashes one male character in the back with his sledge, nailed it for me. It's just the kind of brutal filmed violence I respect. It's not easy doing violence well. It's easier to shake the camera a lot and rely on your cutter and sound man to assist you with the illusion. The blocking of this first attack got my respect because, being a card-carrying convert of the original TEXAS, I had the first film's similar scene to reference.What follows this scene is pretty much the same as the original, although the dinner table scene from the original is MIA.I loved the wheelchair-bound "Daddy" of the clan and the twisted trailer home relatives. I liked what Pearl and director Marcus Nispel did with the lighting of the house and the design of the house's torture chamber.Nice, spooky scoring, too.R. Lee Ermey, who plays a pervert lawman, really chews into his role as he discusses his record of abusing the helpless and conveys a sense of the family's sorry history.It's not a perfect film by any means because the last fifteen minutes tend to drag without the dinner table scene, but it has balls and wasn't reluctant to get nasty and vile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems that Dark Atmosphere = Scary these days in moviemakers' minds. That's not true. I was fortunate enough to see the 1974 original last night and the remake tonight. Yes, the remake is dark, but that doesn't make it scary. The acting in the remake is laughable and unconvincing. The set design is terrible. It adds little if no 'horror atmosphere' to the film. Leatherface's mask and walk, aaahhhhhh, NO! 1. That mask looks like it was bought at a halloween shop, not made by a retarded inbred. 2. For a seriously physically retarded person, he incredibly good on his feet and can easily run at full speed with a chainsaw in hand. Nothing else specific comes to mind now.Here's my advice: if you REALLY want to see this film, watch it first, THEN watch the original. That way you'll be go up to another level instead of feeling like you've just wasting 90 minutes on the remake.I'm just writing this off the top of my head, so sorry for the lack of organization. Flame me if desired. My email's listed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inferior To The Original Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Needless to say, this is an inferior film in comparison to the 1974 film. The family is certainly as hideous as the one in the original film, but the kids in here are as dumb as ever. The framing device, while intriguing, owes more than a little to The Blair Witch Project. It attempts to lend an aura of authenticity and credibility to the film that just doesn't follow. There is telegraphed suspense with obvious musical cues and plenty of gratuitous closeups of blood and gore, not suspenseful. Leather-face is less than spectacular, although he runs awful fast with that chainsaw operating. R. Lee Ermey, as the slime-ball sheriff, is the best thing in this movie. The common problems with many bad horror/slasher/pursuer vs. pursued films are huge lapses in credibility and logic. The pursuer shows up suddenly in instances where not only you least expect it, but where it is darn near next to impossible, like after he's been severely injured. There are a few such scenes in this movie. This is not suspense; the audience feels like its been had. Jessica Biel tries her best as the hottie that's pursued, but even she falls victim to exploitation by the director, with close shots of her in a soaking wet shirt and bare torso. 1/2 star of 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing Original Here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie took "The Blair Witch Project" and mixed in "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and created a stupid piece of crap. Just another teen horror flick that lacks all the originality, gore (for the 70s), and low-budget creepiness of either of the 2 above-mentioned movies. The 7th Heaven Girl (jessica whatever) did an okay job, but nobody shone in this movie. Nothing is standout in it, aside from Tobe Hooper's near bout with homelessness. I figure his destitution must be what convinced him to allow this thing to be made. No artistic explanation exists to support such a decision.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The remake of the 1974 Texas Chainsaw Massacre is absolutely horrid. The actors are pretty good; convincing in their own characters. The problem with the movie is its overall teen thriller syndrome: flailing breasts, dumb heroics, wrong turns galore, and a supposed completing-the-circle ending. The only thing I found worthwhile was having laughs with my pseudo-date. I have not seen the original but I have no desire to watch it unless I'm craving for humor and have an uncanny desire to throw popcorn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another Hollywood remake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remake after remake after remake after remake?it seems that as every week goes by there are two more rumored remakes of old Hollywood, independent, or foreign films. What's the reason? Are Hollywood writers taking a break? Are there no more books being written to translate into screenplays? Do these questions matter? I don't mean to whine, but it seems ridiculous to me that creativity is being stifled in favor of these old tales being rehashed time and again. On to the review?the movie was pretty bad (perhaps I am biased). It scared you at the right times and it was fun to see all the gore the MPAA allowed, but it was no different from any other studio horror film to be released in the past two-three years. Exceptionally average at best, it appeared as if the director was a little confused on how to tell the story. He decided to have both gore and lots of back-story, a technique that has worked in some movies before, but could not pull it off. The chase scenes were erratic and edited like a music video (along with remakes being another trend I hope dies soon), that being a shame because there is some really nice cinematography shot by Daniel Pearl (the cinematographer from the original ?Texas Chainsaw Massacre' as well) and a lot of it is lost during said chase scenes. Overall it was a mess, a bloody, scary, forgettable mess that doesn't need to be seen even once. Rating: 15/40</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good, not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, to start off, let me say something rather blasphemous... the original TCM was no brilliant movie. It was groundbreaking, yes, but only because it was the first "slasher" film (or the first to make any impact, anyway.) But it was not the masterpiece of horror that some people make it out to be.That being said, the remake was quite enjoyable. In fact, I'd say it was at least as good as the original by all common standards of film review. However, it lacked the one thing that made the original special; and all that is was making it first.Neither film is particularly innovative plotwise; a bunch of teens run across some rather sadistic people, one of whom has a penchant for wearing other people's skin. The remake, however, has a few advantages over the original; the acting, cinematography, and direction are superior. Neither film is very frightening, though I will give credit to the first one for being somewhat more disturbing, leaving more up to the imagination.The only thing I can really fault the remake for is changing Leatherface's motivation. That was a real cop out. Other than that however, for a slasher film, the new TCM was quite well done.In short, the new TCM is far better than many of the the hack 'em up horror films of the past few decades. But if you're looking for sheer horror genius... well, you're not going to find it in ANY slasher film. Go rent some David Cronenberg or Clive Barker instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the Originals, But not the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is certainly better than the original makings of the story in 1974. Scott Kosar does a better job making the story a bit more creative and substantial, in my opinion, while Marcus Nispel makes the story have a very intriguing quality to it. The introduction and summation that take place at the beginning and the end are very haunting and creepy, and the overall feel of the film from the get-go does a great job of preparing you for a great ride of emotions. By far this film outdoes the older versions.The action sequences are exciting, although at points they become too predictable, but Nispel does a superior job of making what was a very predictable storyline become, at points, surprising.At points the subtle comedy thrown in is over the top, and at other points throughout the film it seems to be simply gore for gore's sake (nothing entirely interesting that is conducive to the plot or heightens the viewer's senses, but rather just blood and guts for the mere sake of it).The film is very good for a scare and if anyone liked the originals they should love what was done with the most recent version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not good, but not bad either.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remaking a horror classic is not easy for even the most veteran director. For every success like John Carpenter's The Thing or Invasion of the Body Snatchers, there is a House on Haunted Hill or Night of the Living Dead. So with chips stacked against him, Director Marcus Nispel (who's directing experience was limited to a straight to video Janet Jackson video montage), set out under the eyes of no less than 11 producers including Michael Bay (The Rock), to remake the 1974 cult classic The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The original was based on a story by Tobe Hooper (Poltergeist) and was inspired by the real life story of serial killer Ed Gein. The movie was about five good looking teens who after picking up a deranged hitch-hiker, end up at the home of a deranged family of cannibals and are soon killed one by one.The remake does its best to take the original story and churn it into something that although still set in 1973, has all the gore and feel of a movie made in the next millennium. In the 2003 version, a group of five youths lead by Jessica Biel (Erin) in a tight white tank top and Eric Balfour (HBO's Six Feet Under) as Kemper, pick up a hitchhiker who intentionally shoots herself in the back of their van in fear of returning to a place where `she can't go back'. The group then heads for the nearest gas station and arrange to have the sheriff meet them at a secluded farm in order to report the incident and have the body rightfully removed from their vehicle. While waiting for the sheriff the group splits with Erin and Kemper walking to a nearby house for help while the remaining three stay with the remains. It is in the house that the first casualty occurs as a bohemian of a character known to horror fans as Leatherface, takes his first victim and the horror begins. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2003 version is about as bloody and gruesome as they come. We see bits of brain and hair in the back seat of the van, people are chopped, chainsawed and put on hooks like meat, and in the most memorable of scenes, Erin looks through the darkness at the horror of her female friend being chainsawed by a man wearing her boyfriends skin over his face. So is this a good movie? Not really. But it isn't bad either. I appreciated the way that Marcus Nispel used a color scheme in the film that projected the look of the 1970's and the actor portraying Leatherface, does his best to be the most menacing figure on screen not to utter a word since Jason Voorhees in Friday the 13th Part II. I also really liked the way they opened and closed the film with fake news footage narrated by John Larroquette (who also narrated the original). It set the tone and made you believe you were watching something that was actually based on true events.Surprisingly, one of the negatives was the first films positive. The family of cannibals and the townspeople seemed too outlandish to be possible and actor R. Lee Ermey (Full Metal Jacket) gets too much screen time as the ever angry sheriff. However, despite all its flaws, the movie is a good scare and better than most horror movies out there.  </fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the way back from a vacation in Mexico in 1973 and driving through a desolate, backwater Texas town, a group of youths pick up a troubled drifter who warns them of impending danger. Their investigation of who she is, where she came from, and what she's doing there soon turns into a nightmare of unspeakable terror after they're pursued by a sadistic, deformed killer and his deranged family members. Familiar horror film with a surprising but unpleasantly cruel since of humor is effective in creating an intense, creepy atmosphere and some occasional scares, but the characters are unappealing, the violence is unrelenting, and the whole thing is greatly exaggerated. Sure to please the right audience. *?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake of a classic was good, but it wasn't as scary or creepy as the original. It does have more blood and more gore where as in the original TCM it was mostly implied. Of course, these kids do some stupid things. I am thinking why not just leave the body at the store and be on your way. If the sheriff didn't care enough to come, why would they drive out in the middle of no where to find him. The reason the kids go off the main road and get stuck was better in the original. The house they go to was very creepy and I liked the use of light as they walked through the woods. And the chase at the end used light and shadows very effectively to make it scary. The ending with the girl and baby was OK, but I'm glad they added that extra black and white footage because that made the ending so much better. Some things that made the original better was the dinner scene, and scene with the finger blood sucking. And of course, the part where the girl was pushing the guy in the wheelchair in the dark and then all of a sudden there's a chain saw. Well, in this one, there is no wheel chair guy and no scene that will make you jump out of your seat like that one.FINAL VERDICT: One of the better scary movies that's come out in the past several years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I went in hoping for a scary movie and wasn't disappointed. It wasn't as scary as the original, but is was scary compared to a lot of horror movies. The big disappointment was that is could have been better. After the suspense of the opening scenes, which kept you on the edge of your seat. Knowing that these teenagers are walking into a trap and all the people they speak to are in on it. When it came to some scenes they were predictable. Who wouldn't have seen that the gun had no bullets, the drink was spiked and the car wasn't going to start.Also why were the actions of the teenagers, so stupid. Would you really wander about an abandoned old mill when a person has told them that all her family were dead and the teenagers were all going to die also? Any sane person would have got away. Why did the girl go in the slaughter house looking for help at the end. You would have thought that she'd learned her lesson by now. She'd already asked 5 people for help and they were all clearly insane and wanted her dead. And another stupid error was how could leatherface with his weight catch up to a athletic looking lad and saw his leg off. I would like a horror movie to be intelligently thought out and not full of holes.Overall a good movie if you dismiss all the holes in the plot and just want to be scared senseless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just OK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If it weren't a remake, i think I would have been bored with this movie. The only real interest I had was seeing what they kept and changed from the original. As a remake of a classic horror film, it makes a good try but falls a tad short. For one, it's much too "slick" looking. The first one works because it seems real - like a documentary. This one comes across as "See? Here's where leatherface makes his skin masks. Isn't it WEIRD?" In other words, this one is trying to be strange and unsettling where the first one just plain was.Also, getting rid of the hitchhiker character (or changing it as they did) was a big mistake in my book. Although no one could top Ed Neal for a total whacko, I still think this movie needs that character. I guess R. Lee Ermy kind of replaced him, and they used this hitchhiker to set up their slightly different (and admittedly less coincidental than the original) storyline.Overall, just OK. Some shocks along the way, but by the end its all kind of numbing and your like "enough with the saw already." It has none of the creepy atmosphere that makes the first so compelling. This was just another slick horror film made for teenagers.</fullReview>

Unnecessary yet slicked-up remake of the shoestring-budgeted cult favorite has five teens inadvertently finding themselves besieged by a hulking chainsaw wielding madman on a joyride through dusty Texas. Thirty years later, this is just as engrossing, scary, and tense all the way, but also grimy, repetitive, and brutal. Story is bookended with black and white footage. Good photography, again, by the original's Daniel Pearl and narrated, again, by John Larroquette.

		<fullReview>Soooooo...Where do I begin? Any social relevance? Any ground-breaking horror? Any non-stop grip of tension? Any good?Nope!What I think these extremely silly producers, film execs., and directors are doing is the same as Tom Savini did for 'Night of the Living Dead' in '90, and that was to pretty much - not so much make a decent film, but to bring a classic back into the public eye for a new generation of fans. Unfortunetly, like Savini's 'NOTLD', it doesn't capture the general aesthetic of what the original set out to do.What decent horror films miss these days are the abandon-all-hope scenarios, the originality, the tension and the format of filming. I mean, you look at films like 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'Last House on the Left', 'Blood Feast', and 'Zombie Flesh Eaters' (et al) and you get a sense of watching a very real film. These days everything is all polished and neatly wrapped up for the public's consumption, hopefully bringing in the cash for the studios.The sad thing about this is that this will actually happen. The studios are looking to capitalise on today's audience and remake a classic that has passed into legend and try to reopen the doors for a new generation of 'Texas Chainsaw...' and 'Leatherface' fans.As I was saying earlier, the film completely misses the general aesthetic of the format for this type of film. I mean, you don't cast people like Jessica Biel for goodness sake. You need unknowns, people who you've never seen before. I mean, it makes as much sense as seeing De Niro in an 'Evil Dead' movie. The only reason they've done this is so that when they advertise, the public will see a pretty young girl, somebody who they've seen before on some crappy American television show doing whatever the hell it is she does best.They did the same thing for 'Halloween: Resurrection'..."Starring Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode..."She's in the movie for 10 minutes but the studios advertise it this way so that horror fans who have looked into the history of those films will be attracted to it.But anyway, enough of my ranting about how the studios are trying to screw us out of our cash, again.How's the film?

		<fullReview>ok i liked the first 4 mins-then it lost the plot a bit but im confused as to why this is classed as a remake,the only things that remain from the original are leatherface and a vw van-there is nothing else in it that has anything to do with the original classic. i get the feeling the execs had a think tank day -1.shall we say its a remake and get lots of publicity or 2.lets just call it chainsaw 5 and see if it doesnt go straight to video. hollywood should stop being ashamed of horror movies and call it as they are,this is not a remake-no way,no how. if it is-then as a remake it sucks but as part 5 its a pretty good chapter-all hail part 6-if and when!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Pretty... I contain spoilers... sorry...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I apologize in advance if this is a little incoherent. Some of us never sleep.After seeing the preview for this new Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie, I decided that if I didn't get to see it in theaters, I would just keel over dead. I think anyone else who saw the preview could agree with that. It looked like it could have a similar effect on the audience that the original did.So I went to see it on opening night, and since then I've been thinking about my overall opinion. I enjoyed the movie. The look of it was stunning. I'll probably buy the DVD when it comes out. The acting was decent. The storyline, however, was hectic.I liked some of the added touches where this builds from the original, but then the screen writer threw in all of these sub-plots that end up going nowhere. I understand that watching the engagement ring falling out the dead Kemper's pocket is supposed to build sympathy for the characters, but is it necessary? What is the point of the baby? And why on earth couldn't Jessica Biel pick up the chainsaw when Leatherface dropped it? She had plenty of opportunities to do so, while he was fighting with Morgan. Who is Morgan supposed to be related to anyway? Everyone says he's Erin's brother, but there seemed to be more sibling vibes coming from Kemper.My final verdict? The preview was scarier than the actual movie. I jumped a couple of times, but it was the same way I jump when a bug flies toward my face. I'd recommend checking it out, but if you've seen the original Tobe Hooper version you may find this remake a little long, and kinda dull. If you haven't seen the original, I can't promise that this will scare you anyway... but if you hate it, please don't let that stop you from watching the original.</fullReview>

It wasn't scary! It wasn't thrilling! No one cared if the cast died or not - they just didn't matter!Don't see this movie. See anything else at the theater - or just stay home and pick belly-button lint. That maybe scarier and will be far less boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary and Effective Horror Remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, a remake of Tobe Hooper's 1974 cult slasher film, loosely based on the crimes of Ed Gein, was surprisingly watchable and entertaining. The film overall basically sticks to it's original, with some changes here and there. The movie begins with five teens on their way to a Lynrd Skynrd concert in Dallas, Texas. They pick up a disturbed hitchiker on the road and she then commits suicide in front of them. Sick and puzzled on what to do, they come across a quiet hillbilly town, and plan to meet a local sheriff at an abandoned mill. From there on, they wander into a nightmare of a family of murderous and crazed psychopaths, led by the handyman with a chainsaw, Leatherface.Director Marcus Nispel keeps settings appropriately dark and distubring, and keeps you focused on what's happening. The '74 film had a scratchy, documentary-style look to it, as in the remake it has a more glossy, updated look. There are a few very neat shots in the film, including a shot where the camera moves with the bullet, through a person's head and through a hole in the back window caused by the shot of the gun. Our actors here aren't bad, and they include Jessica Biel (TV's 7th Heaven, Summer Catch), Erica Leerhsen (Blair Witch 2), Jonathan Tucker (The Virgin Suicides), and many more. The new and improved Leatherface is essentialy scary, and there is plenty of gore in the movie, actually a lot more than in the original film. All in all, if you are a true TCM fan, you will enjoy this a lot, or even if you are a horror fan. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre delivers plenty of scares, thrills, and suspense. I give it a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This does not hold a candle to the original film. For the first nearly 25 to 45 minutes, I was bored. I thought they totally ruined the character of Leatherface. He just wasn't as scary as in the original. And even if I had never seen the original, I still would have hated this film. The family in this film, while well cast, just plain sucked compared to the original movie. The ending was comparable to a thousand different slasher films, the meat packing plant just didn't do it for me. It's a waste, the whole thing. I was expecting more and I was really disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was entertaining. It forced some screams out of me, my friends and the audience but that about it. I was never allowed to see the first Chainsaw, plus I scared more easily then,so I'm unable to make a comparison.I did however feel that this movie was Hollywoodized compliments to Mr. Bay. There wasn't enough gore and by the time the last two are killed off you just...know what to expect. From what I've heard, the first one is scarier. I didn't even flinch when I saw his face.I was also both baffled and mystified by the "inspired by" wording before this movie. The 1973 thing threw it for me. Then after some research I realize that oh, none of this ever happened in Texas and that it was all "inspired by" some freak named Ed Gein from Wisconsin. I don't know about you but I would have been more intrigued had they done an account of his life. But we get this from Silence of the Lambs and more similar the Hannibal. So all these creepy horror films are "inspired by" this one guy. Talk about the powers of fiction and melodrama. So knowing this, I'm not as intrigued. Watch the first one for the scare. Watch this one for the entertainment.</fullReview>

This movie was good and the Full Metal Jacket Sgt was the best. I loved the way he was so incredible. The bad part about this movie is that the director forgot to build up suspense in the final scene. That scene was a rip off of Blair Witch Project. However, I FORTIVE the director. Yes, this movie was scary in the hillbilly sence. The two ladies in the camper were eerie as all heck. That kid was stupid though. Why did he help leatherface? He is supposed to be loyal. Oh, did you like Leatherface's LACK OF A NOSE? Yes, he had a terrible SKIN DISEASE. This movie will go on the history list with other notables sutch as LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT. By the way, did you notice at the end, that the sherrif's eyes were moving?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deep in Rural Texas Lives A Maniacal, Chainsaw Wielding Man Known as 'Leatherface'. He's Mean. He's Unstoppable. He's Hungry.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!!]On August 19, 1973, five friends coming home from a trip to Mexico pass through rural Texas. The friends consist of Erin, Kemper, Andy, Morgan, and Pepper. They had actually gone down to Mexico to purchase marijuana. Two pounds of it. Erin was mad when she found out. Suddenly they see a young woman walking beside the road, so they pick her up. She raved about people trying to kill her and she was also covered in blood, so she went through something awful. Something drastic. What's more, she pulls out a gun, sticks the barrell into her mouth, pulls the trigger...BAM! Kemper, Erin, Pepper, Andy and Morgan are in shock and appauled. They quickly drive their van to the gas station to call the sheriff. The old lady attendant calls him and tells the kids to go meet him at Crawford Mill. Morgan suggested they just dump the girl's body and head to the Lynard Skynard concert they had tickets too. Andy agreed, but Kemper, Erin and Pepper chose to wait for the sheriff. Kemper and Erin went to a large house because according to a little boy, Jedidiah, hanging out at the mill, that was the sheriff's house but it actually belonged to a strange old man in a wheel chair. Erin phoned the sheriff while Kemper looked around the house. Suddenly, a man wearing a mask of human flesh bludgeoned Kemper with a mallet and dragged him away. The man was Thomas Hewitt, or Leatherface. Erin left.Meanwhile, the sheriff finally showed up. He and Andy wrap the girl in saran wrap and load her into the sheriff's trunk. Then he left. Back at the Hewitt house, Erin and Andy came to look for Kemper. They soon confront Leatherface, who roared his mighty chainsaw at them. He manages to saw off Andy's leg and carry him back to the house. Erin races back to the van and they try to escape, but their stupid van won't start. Suddenly, the sheriff returns and he spots the weed! Uh oh! He then went on to suspect they had murdered the girl. He took Morgan into the van and tried to make him reenact the crime, but Morgan made the mistake of pointing an unloaded gun at the sheriff. That did it. Sheriff threw Morgan into his car and took off. Suddenly, just as Erin hotwired the van (the sheriff took the keys) and managed to drive off, their tires fell off. They were then left at the mercy of Leatherface, who kills Pepper. Erin runs for her life. Leatherface gives chase. She hides at a trailer where two strange ladies and a baby live. Erin discovers the baby was stolen from a family who was slaughtered. Suddenly, Erin is taken to the Hewitt house where, amazingly, the sheriff and the old lady from the gas station lived.Erin makes her way into the kitchen to see body parts and bones everywhere, including the gruesome remains of Kemper and Andy. Then, Jedidiah helps her and Morgan (whom the sheriff brought) escape. Leatherface chases. Leatherface manages to get Morgan, but Erin escapes to a slaughter house. Leatherface chases her through the cattle ranges and freezer. Finally, she grabs a meat cleaver and chops off Leatherface's arm. She ran out into the rain and flagged down a trucker. The trucker drove her to the gas station to get helped, but Erin was too frightened. The sheriff and the ladies from earlier were there. So was the baby. Erin took the baby, hotwired the sheriff's car and ran him over as she made her escape. The next day, another sheriff investigated the Hewitt house when suddenly Leatherface shows up and kills him and his deputies. And so ends the tragically true story of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. A case that to this day, remains open.This movie was actually pretty good. Though some parts are very violent and very disturbing and scary, the movie was still good. A good remake to the 1974 original. This actually isn't Part 5, it's a remake of Part 1. It sure makes up for that stupid Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation of 1994, but I wish they'd stop remaking the original and make an actual sequel. Like one that takes place in the present day and Leatherface is caught and permanently killed. Oh, for all you Leatherface fans, the Leather-meister is unmasked for a moment in this movie and boy is he hideous!! We also learn Leatherface's reason for making masks of human flesh: He was cursed with a skin disease as a lad. But the reason why he and his family are cannibals remains a mystery. He yam what he yam, to quote Popeye the Sailor. Cast: Jessica Biel is Erin, Jonathan Tucker is Morgan who looks like Jerry in the original. R. Lee Ermey is that nasty sheriff. Andrew Bryniarski is Thomas Hewitt, or Leatherface. Mike Vogel is Andy. Eric Balfour is Kemper. Erica Leerhsen is Pepper. And, David Dorfman is Jedidiah. So in conclusion, I recommend you go see The Texas Chainsaw Massacre today! But brace yourself for blood, gore, body parts and intestines strewn apart and be prepared to be scared like you've never been scared before! There's no stopping...Leatherface!-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing As Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I blatantly refused to pay to see this film from the beginning and only agreed to view it in the theater when a friend agreed to pay. I'm very glad that I did not fork over the $6.00 because this film was just as disappointing as I expected. I strongly urge everyone that did not see the original to rent it before seeing this garbage...you will have a greater appreciation for what works better in low budget than with a big budget.More of a remake of Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III than a remake of the original film, the plot surrounds a group of teenagers similar to the ones in the original, pitted against a town of wacky, backroads crazies, including the notorious Leatherface. While it does reference the opening van sequence from the 1973 classic and a few brief moments scattered through out, the movie doesn't have the look or feel that Tobe Hooper captured in his original. Walking away from the original film, I felt weak and abused...that's a good horror movie. After watching the remake, I felt bored and there's just nothing about it to remember but it's faults.Here's what ruined the film: (1) Although John Larroquette returned to voice the same opening dialogue from the first film, his voice-over is marred by unnecessary B&amp;W imagery and interrupted with an annoying, Blair Witch-inspired crime scene investigation (2) the assortment of backroad crazies in no way compare to the realism of the Family in the original film, they just seem cartoonish (3) Biel cannot capture the terror that Burns portrayed in the original film, the new chase sequences lack the suspense of the original...and this is the 70s, what's with Biel's bra under the tank top!? (4) Even though you don't see the deaths in either film, the implication of a horribly violent death is so much more vivid in the original, and that says a lot considering the budget (5) the farmhouse is more of a plantation mansion and there's no grotesque living room! (5) There's no dinner sequence! (6) Too many references to other horror films; ie. Jeepers Creepers, Blair Witch Project, Hills Have Eyes (7) The soundtrack is annoying; they leave out the opening song from the commercial and all the build-up sequences, chase sequences and remote suspense have a BGM that lacks any sense of terror...the budget soundtrack of the original gave the film a sense of raw grit that made it scary, even thinking about the sounds (excluding the chainsaw) still creep me out (8) When discussing the Lynyrd Skynyrd concert that the teens have front row tickets to, Biel says "I hope they play 'Free Bird'." HELLO! Obviously they are going to play 'Free Bird'. Apparently the writers didn't think EVERYBODY would know who Skynyrd is.I saw a horrid trailer for the upcoming Dawn of the Dead remake before viewing TCM, it seems that the horror industry has either run out of ideas or would rather make money off garbage remakes of low budget classics. One would think after the last 2 decades of crap that SOMEBODY would make a horror film worth paying to see. And what's with remakes? Too afraid of the sequel curse? The film is going to suck whether or not it's a remake or a sequel. Period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miserable Attempt at a remake of a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please do yourself justice and see the original TCM BEFORE you watch this one.I saw this movie hoping that a remake would be a welcomed addition to the TCM legacy and make up for the terrible parts 2 and 3 that simply were piles of crap.Well, spearhead by Jessica Beil, this cast has very low star power, and I doubt that it cost much more than a few million to make this movie. No doubt that it will make a nice penny due to the fame of its benefactor the original.TCM 2003, is little more than a glorified "screamer". When I say screamer I talking about movies that attempt to scare the crowd and make them jump with things popping up here and there-- see Wrong Turn, House of the Dead, Dreamcatcher, etc. There is very little and I mean little development of the evil characters. You really dont get the creepy,maniacal introduction to the family like you do inthe original.Bascially what you have is a cheap, poorly thought out slasher movie, with a LOT of screaming and stupid decisions , poorly shot camera angels and not much realism. The original actually seemed like this sick family could exist somewhere out there in the sticks, but this remake makes look like nothing more than a souped up version of motel hell.Don't expect much, Leatherface is poorly done, the grandpa is nothing more than a grumpy invalid (no near dead finger sucking) and JR is a loudmouthed fake cop who really doesnt sell anyone into believing he is legit.A Big dissapointment indeed, TCM fans save yourself the pain and watch underworld, which is the best movie of 2003... so far.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Recommend The Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have never seen the original "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (released in 1974) then this movie may well be of some appeal to you. It isn't a bad slasher flick, it has both suspense and gore (although perhaps not quite as much gore as I was expecting) and unlike the original (which has a cast of complete unknowns) it even has at least one cast member who - while not a mega-star - is relatively recognizable (Jessica Biel, who was actually pretty convincing as the terrified - most of the time anyway - Erin.) There's an attempt by Scott Kosar (who adapted the original screenplay) to introduce some original elements - there's the little boy, for example, and there's a much greater emphasis on Leatherface's family. The little boy didn't really add much to the story; the family maybe gave a bit more insight into Leatherface himself, although it all added up to the very stereotypical "dangerous people living in the backwoods of nowhere" type of story. But - as I said - if you've never seen the original, this is passable.If, on the other hand, you have seen the original, then in my opinion this wasn't sufficiently different from the original to make this worthwhile watching. You can admire Jessica Biel's performance. She was almost as good as Marilyn Burns was as Sally in the original, but that of itself isn't enough reason to watch this. Personally, I recommend that you just rewatch the 1974 version if you're really into the story. (4/10)</fullReview>

There was a lot of jumpy bits in the film what took me by surprise but the action and thrill was brilliant! The original was much more gory then this 2003 remake; however I think this one was aiming to make people jump, more then sick. :)I rated this film 9/10 because of the exceedingly slow start but the film was after very good and I would recommend to any Horror Fans.

		<shortDescription>Really a bit of a waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard not to sound clichéd when reviewing this film but the truth of the matter is that it's a watered-down, somewhat boring remake of a seminal 70's movie. It may seem like an obvious or pointless observation depending on your point-of-view but, nevertheless I think it has to be said as this culture of remaking 70's and 80's horror films is really quite tedious. From an artistic standpoint, a film such as The Texas Chain Saw Massacre has no basis for being 'reimagined', as it's power lay in things that were not endangered by it's tiny budget, i.e. great direction, cinematography, music, set design and, most pertinent of all in this remake-age, originality. If its impact had been compromised by, say, primitive special effects then possibly there could be a justification for making it again with today's advanced technology. But it hardly needs saying that this is not the case and the original movie remains great because of talented film-makers who boldly made a film that must've stood out quite brilliantly in 1974. This new edition of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre does not stand out at all in 2003. Like the scores of other recent horror remakes it's an enterprise that is driven purely by money; with the added advantage of not having to think up new and original ways to thrill its audience.Where the original movie built up the atmosphere of dread expertly by giving audiences a real feel for the sun-baked desolation of the Texas outback by means of shots of sun flares accompanied by avant-garde noise, a dead armadillo, an uprooted corpse and a sinister encounter with a drunk man in a cemetery. This version dispenses with anything approximating this atmosphere-laden approach and instead, after a brief black and white segment detailing the police investigation of the massacre, we are immediately introduced to the teenager protagonists in their van. Only this time, they do not pick up the highly disturbed hitch-hiker from the original movie but instead take on-board a girl who has clearly been through some sort of violent trauma. She blows her head off with a concealed gun, and so the nightmare truly begins. The gang report the suicide to the locals and soon discover that these people are not too friendly, in fact, they clearly have homicidal tendencies. Our friend Leatherface is soon introduced into the fray and much chasing and hiding ensue, ending with the final girl.There are only two truly good things about this film that stand comparison with the original movie. Namely, the presence of R. Lee Ermey ? who puts in a very good performance as the sadistic law enforcer ? and Jessica Biel's body, which was frankly very impressive. But that's about it. The film just lacks any true menace and comes across as a standard teen slasher flick more than anything else. The atmosphere is strictly textbook and doesn't have any edge whatsoever. And while there is now some (unnecessary) back-story detailing the origins of Leatherface, the context of the original film has been completely removed, i.e. the introduction of the new automated slaughterhouses resulting in unemployed local slaughterhouse workers who subsequently use their specialist skills on outsiders and resort to cannibalism. In this version Leatherface is simply a retarded boy with a skin condition.While the original film was famous for not being very explicitly gory at all, here the blood flows freely. And if ever, you need an example of why blood and guts in themselves do not a scary horror film make, then this is a textbook example. Its bloodier sure, but far less frightening and disturbing. I don't know if younger viewers by in large prefer the approach of the remake to the Texas Chain Saw Massacre but I certainly hope not. If you haven't seen the original then I guess this might be quite good but if you have its pretty impossible not to compare. And compare you should. Because after all, if the film-makers can't be bothered coming up with their own ideas for a new film and decide instead to remake perfectly fine films from yesteryear, then they basically deserve no better.</fullReview>

Leatherface only massacred one person with a chainsaw in the original but in this, he uses his chainsaw all of the time. Also, I prefer the remake to the original because there are more characters and you learn more about Leatherface and his family. All the acting was amazing, especially Jessica Beil, she was outstanding. If you have saw this movie, I also recommend The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning because the remake series is better than the original series put together. To be honest, I thought the original was rather boring. Don't get me wrong, it is great for a 1974 movie. No remake can compare to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake 10 Out Of 10! **********</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely pointless remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This starts out interesting but quickly become tedious,the original was overrated so I was hoping for some new exciting twists.I usually stay away from remakes but The new Dawn of the Dead really impressed me so I sometimes break down and check one out but this movie is slow and not scary at all.It's all Hollywood gloss and little substance.the best things about this film are the cinematography and acting.the worst is the drawn out chase scene at the end.everything is predictable if you've scene the original this film holds no surprises and if you haven't the plot progression is clumsy.Like in a lot of horror movies the characters make and do the most illogical things but these characters are especially annoying in there incompetence's.skip it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do Not Compare To The Original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is zero doubt the influence and the effectiveness of Tobe Hopper's "Texas Chain Saw Massacre" has had on the film industry. With that in mind, expecting the same from this "re-imagining" would be silly. Does that mean this version is a bad movie? That answer is not necessarily true. Should you expect a good or a great movie? Well, you just have to see for yourself.This "re-imagining" is inspired by a true story. A group of college kids, on their way to a Lenard Skynard concert, run into a hitchhiker. They try to help the girl, but in the process end up falling prey to her mysterious fear. That fear is none other then the chainsaw wielding, Leatherface and his cannibalistic family. Does the group escape, or will they end up being the next meal? First things first, do not compare this to the original "Texas Chain Saw Massacre." This is not even close to the level of that movie. The story, but not the main theme, is very different. Leatherface's family is different and so are all the characters. The only thing that is true to the original is the overall theme of Leatherface chasing and killing teens. If you go to this movie expecting a scene for scene remake, you should skip this and just re-watch the original because you would be disappointed.The results of this movie are mixed. There were some likable moments, yet there were others that make you think, "What the heck were they thinking?" There were some legitimately scary moments throughout. This was not "watch with light on" scary, nor was it "unable to sleep" scary, but it shows enough gore and tense/disturbing moments to do its job. Unfortunately, there was also plenty, especially during the climax of the story, of cheesy moments, which not only ruined some of the scarier scenes but also made for some unintentional laughter.The acting was average. It was not horrible, but it was not very good either. It was what is expected from a slasher movie. Jessica Biel played Erin as well as anyone could have. If she chooses her roles well, she could end up being the next Jamie Lee Curtis. The actor who really stood out was R. Lee Ermey as Sheriff Hoyt. Sheriff Hoyt is the main reason to watch this movie. Andrew Bryniarski was a very scary Leatherface, aka, for this movie, Thomas Hewitt. Though the acting is average, you never go see a horror movie for its amazing acting.Overall, this version of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is entertaining. This is not worth multiple viewings, but it is worth watching. Is it better then the 2004 "re-imagining" of "Dawn of the Dead" or Tobe Hopper's "Texas Chain Saw Massacre?" Nope, but it is still a decent modern day horror movie. Movie lovers should keep their eye out for a severed head of Harry Jay Knowles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First I should say that I wasn't impressed by the original TCM. I thought it was way overrated. That said, I'll make this short and sweet. The only reason to see this movie is the awesome set design and cinematography. However, these aspects were traded for the gritty "realism" of the original, which completely kills the film's momentum. Like Jessica Biel in this movie, the film is overall pretty to look at but there's not much there. R. Lee Emery is here and he's pretty good, but he's just playing a more homicidal version of every other character he's ever played.If you're looking for a better remake, the updated "Hills Have Eyes" was pretty good. It at brought some originality to the table.</fullReview>

Example: when the a**hole cop, who is played by R. Lee Ermey - the only good thing about this movie, starts yelling at them, they just kind of look dumb and don't say anything back? Its just weird and stupid. This just plain sucked. Hollywood horror movie remakes like this and Amityville Horror have been so freakin disappointing. I'd give this 0 stars if I could. Do not rent this movie, your only purpose for watching this film is if you need something to put you to sleep, which is a truly sad thing to say about any horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This just might be the worst movie that I have ever seen. Why would someone want to remake a classic such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. That's like remaking Jaws or Taxi Driver or Pulp Fiction. There is no point. It can't get any better. What's even worse is that a lot of people actually think that this is a good horror flick. I guess that just goes to show you how ignorant some people can be. This movie will be forgotten quickly in the years to come. I hope so, at least. If not, then the world really is coming to an end. If movies like this are continued to be made, then cinema will start to slowly die. I don't want that to happen. If you are one of the lucky few who have not viewed a copy of this movie, run far far away and save yourself. It really is a scary film. Scary in terms of how horrible it truly is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Completely useless remake (in all fairness, it doesn't really deserve to be called a remake - people might think that the original is just as bad) of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. That film, about a group of kids stranded in the middle of nowhere hunted down by a nut with a skin fetish, has been remade as a film about a bunch of complete morons (more on that later) hunted down by a guy with a chainsaw and his inbred crazy family.Neither of the two films are heavy on plot, but the original was truly disturbing and scary. The new version skips all that in favour of blood, spit, vomit, and sweat. Is it gross? Yes. Is there any point in watching it? Well, that depends how much you're in to bodily fluids.Then there's the characters. Holy crap, they're retarded. Not like your average stupid teen horror characters - these guys and girls take stupidity to whole new levels. From about five minutes in, alarm bells should be ringing in their heads: "Get out of here! Get out of here!" But sadly, no. They make every possible wrong choice there is to make. As the film progresses you're amazed how each character not only are complete idiots, but they also evolve into even more stupid characters."Say, that sheriff that wrapped up the dead girl in plastic and threw her in the trunk (after he fondled her a bit first, of course), well, he must be an honest and decent fellow." RUN! FLEE! But sadly, no. Why run and hide in the forest, or just run for that matter, when you can hide inside a building where every crazed killer within a five mile radius is bound to find you? If your handcuffed friend is fighting with one of the aforementioned killers, would it not be better to scratch his eyes out, kick him, pick up the chainsaw from the floor and dice him, than to slap him on the back? But sadly, no.I guess some mention should go to the rest of the poor saps that inhabit this demented hell hole. As mentioned earlier, it's a bunch of weird freaks that serves no other purpose than being weird and evil (apart for the kid, who made even less sense than any of the others). What's their motivation? Poor Leatherface has got a skin disease and was bullied as a child. Anyone can see how that would turn them all into cannibalistic weirdos, right? But sadly, no - I don't.Some people seem to really like the look of the film, with fast editing, gritty pictures, eerie music, and cool lighting effects. Well, the editing is pretty fast I guess, but adding a sepia filter to the film, ripping music (and poor R Lee Ermey) from Seven, and shining a spotlight through some cracks in a wall can hardly be called anything near fantastic. Kudos, though, to the screenwriters who managed to cram in several scenes where it was raining or dripping water for no other reason than to show off Biel's "acting skills".There is exactly one sensible character in this entire film - and she blows her brains out ten minutes in or so. Now, if only the other cool kids could have done the same (I believe there were five bullets left in the gun - enough for everyone) the pain and misery that calls itself The Texas Chainsaw Massacre could have been over in less than 15 minutes. But sadly, no. [1/10]</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the stupidest horror movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hated it. It honestly has got to be one of the stupidest horror movies of all time. It did not make any sense and in a weird way a lot of parts were to predictable but in a another weird way unpredictable and did not make any sense. You can usually figure out something is going to happen when you watch horror movies but this was well different, it wasn't really put together well. A good horror movie you can predict that something is going to happen, but usually just not when or what or how. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, well you knew something was going to happen, and basically after the first five scenes of the movie you know the what and the when and the how so it wasn't very interesting after the first quarter of the movie.The parts that I couldn't figure out but I think I do now is well the bad guy so to speak lets say has a fatal wound you would think that he wouldn't be alive in like five minutes and low and behold by some sort of magical power, and still very much alive, and some sort of ESP he finds the victim who might be at the time well away from the previous location. Which it seemed for half the movie it was the same two people. At the very least they could of made it interesting like he comes back as some sort of zombie, and then it might be more interesting and it would be a little bit more put together. I do not know anything would be better. It leaves you sitting there going well that was really just great.So I found it to be more dumb than scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now this is how you do a remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will admit it, I hated the fact that Hollyywood was remaking one of my all time favourite horror movies, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), the film scared me when I was a kid &amp; I enjoy the movie anytime I see it, it's a fun popcorn horror flick, well worth the critical praise &amp; recognition it has received throughout the many years it's been out. I just couldn't see how it could be remade &amp; went into the film with low expectations, only to be pleasantly surprised over how much I enjoyed the film for what it is! While it's nowhere near as scary, Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) is a wickedly fun horror flick all of it's own!What should be noted is how this remake has a much more polished look than the original, due to studio backing, a bigger budget, a few name actors &amp; as well as being shot on 35mm film (the original was shot on 16mm). The film also adds some pretty brutal on screen kills &amp; gore, wherein the original film had most of it's violence being committed off screen. It was so well written &amp; shot that it made you think you saw an awful lot of violence &amp; gore but you didn't. Despite the fact the film is a remake of the superb 1974 scarefest, SCOTT KOSAR's script is very clever &amp; inventive. While a lesser screenwriter would simply rehash the original film almost shot for shot, he radically changes the story &amp; plot points around, making the characters radically different &amp; having each of them suffer much different fates, which helps give the film a much fresher feel than most &amp; manages the difficult feat of being genuinely scary &amp; suspenseful, which is something that cannot be said for the vast majority of remakes, especially ones based on classic horror films. There are enough changes made to help keep things nice &amp; fresh, it's defiantly not predictable. He dispenses with the original plot of the kids visiting their grandfathers grave-site, that has been dug up, with other corpses removed &amp; body parts taken &amp; also dispenses with the kids visiting a family home. Here the kids are on their way to a rock concert with a pi?ata stuffed with two pounds of marijuana that they purchased in Mexico. The family here is called The Hewitts, not the Sawyers, the names of the kids are different, Leatherface is given a surname (Thomas) &amp; for the first time in the series history, we actually get a good look at what is behind that mask (but be forewarned it's not pretty!) the family is also radically different: Sheriff Hoyt (wonderfully played with sadistic glee by R. LEE ERMEY) really steals the show &amp; at times even overshadows Leatherface, as a cruel family Sheriff &amp; there's more villains this time, each executed differently in terms of characterization, including an innocent family member, a child who spends most of his time hiding away from his cruel family. Despite these changes the film still claims to be based on actual events which is only partially true. The best thing that could be said for the remake is the fact that the film is much better &amp; certainly far superior than any of the sequels to come after the classic 1974 original. It returns the series back to it's dark gritty roots, adding heavy doses of suspense &amp; tension &amp; really soaks up the atmosphere, something that was sadly missing in the sequels, at least to the degree as it is presented here. Best of all, for the first time in a long time, Leatherface is scary again! the remake also tends to present itself as more of a teen horror film than what the first, or any of the sequels did &amp; the gore effects are pretty good here, with people thrown on hooks, finger nails being scratched off, a chainsaw to the groin, a sawed off leg, people bludgeoned with a sledgehammer &amp; a hacked off arm etc.The film his very well acted with ANDREW BRYNIARSKI absolutely terrifying as Leatherface, easily one of the best performers to ever wear the infamous rotting skin stitched mask &amp; the direction by MARCUS NSIPEL also works as he is able to muster up a few edge of your seat moments &amp; the chase scenes are well captured on camera &amp; stages an effective climax in a meat factory as Jessica Biel is forced on the run from the chainsaw wielding madman. What should be noted here is how the film-makers avoid a dinner scene at the climax, there is no badly ageing grandfather either &amp; much more noticeably, the family here is not grave robbers, nor is their house adorned with rotting bones, corpses &amp; animal skins &amp; crudely made furniture, minus the basement that is, which is where Leatherface has his crude workshop set up, adorned with teeth, hairs &amp; skins. What also should be noted is how the family is not cannibalistic at all &amp; while they make for some terrifying villains, they are nowhere near as over the top, or as interesting as the Sawyer family in the original.The acting works, JESSICA BIEL puts in a strong performance as the lead heroine who is forced to fight of the family to save her own life, unlike Sally in the original, she is tougher. Also worth noting is how JOHN LARROQUETTE returns to narrate the opening proceedings, his first time since the 1974 original &amp; original Director of Photography DANIEL PEARL performs the same duties here as he did in the 1974 original. Highly recommended to fans! Followed by a prequel: Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning.**** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A disappointment. The original `Texas Chainsaw Massacre' is somewhat overrated--its realistic approach is certainly ugly and shocking, but there's little elegance to it, and apart from one or two disgusting (rather than disturbing) images, we don't come away from it remembering much. This new version takes a fantastical approach rather than a literal one--it's beautifully shot, with an MTV director and the original cinematographer coming together to make a dark, gorgeous, Southern Gothic visual world. It's never quite believable--why would anyone build a house like that? why would anyone live there?--but it looks like something out of Flannery O'Connor. But nothing else about it is any good. It's ugly, all right, but not in any original way--it's just another by-the-numbers slasher flick with teens getting mowed down one at a time. They're not wisecracking teens, thank God, but they are stupid, annoying, and ill-defined ones (and I won't even talk about the movie's offensive view of rural people), and the main problem is, such un-self-consciously bad dialogue cannot survive anything but a realistic approach. See `The Blair Witch Project' for a comparison. Here, the slick production makes the awful writing all the more noticeable. The actors try their best, but the script prevents them from getting anywhere, and the camera won't let us see whether Jessica Biel is any good, because it's too preoccupied with her wet t-shirt. (R. Lee Ermey is kind of funny, but he's been doing this same character for far too long now.) There is only one moment where the movie comes close to realizing its potential--the scene where Erin stumbles into the trailer is like something out of a nightmare version of `Alice in Wonderland.' (I half-expected the baby to turn into a pig!). But it doesn't last long, and it's just one lovely dark island in an ocean of same-old, same-old. Not recommended. 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE by "Tired-face".WARNING: Meat SPOILERS (There are movie SPOILERS in this review --- Aren't I just ROTTEN?)Tonight I decided to watch a movie that I thought no one would dare remake. Regardless of genre, when a movie shines, it is usually a wise decision to never to try and remake it. I watched Tim Burton's remake of Planet of The Apes, and it was horrible compared to the "Get your stinking paws off me'--Heston classic. About the only repeat worse than that was the indigestion I amassed from watching it. I later remembered watching Gus Van Zant's remake of Psycho and thought to myself, why bother doing a shot for shot remake.Again, I was left scratching my head, or picking my brain....but not literally like Ray Liotta did in Cannibal. ... Now I am hearing that Superman is in the stages of being remade. Ugh.With few exceptions, like with remake of Cape Fear, remake of classics usually fall far short of their expected hype.About a year ago, and while watching my TV, I stumbled across the trailer for the new `Chainsaw' movie ( "b-r-r-r" "b-r-r-r" - chainsaw sound effect), it made me hope that it was done by the Brits. The thought of the British having "Leather-face" to be played instead by some character named `Sir Loin' thrilled the juvenile side of me to no end. But that is enough of my silliness.("b-r-r-r" "b-r-r-r")Anyway, I started hearing people actually talk about the remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre..'Incredible', `Better than expected`, and other more juicy and savory remarks that were rather refreshing and surprising were being udder-ed....e-r-r.I mean uttered.The final vote to swing me into action came from a friend of mine who also thought the movie was pretty well done, and she did see the original too.So I decided to rent this movie. ("b-r-r-r" "b-r-r-r"). First thing I thought was noticeably good was Sweet Home Alabama by Skynyrd. Funny enough, it would be the last song you would hear. After that the madness began..And no, it wasn't that I was trying to cook hamburgers while talking on a cell phone that was plugged into a wall this evening. But enough of me already..I am such a `ham'.I knew I was in for a treat when the camera showed the shocked expressions of the teens that picked up a hitchhiker.. through the back of the gaping hole of the hitchhikers head, where her brains had once been, until she shot herself.M-m-m-m-m.Nothing like the sizzle of hamburgers cooking on my George Foreman grill..("b-r-r-r" "b-r-r-r")... but I digest."e-r-r"..digress.Anyway, the movie kicks into high gear from there. The young adults are stupid, and make all the wrong moves. But otherwise, no movie right? The meat of the meat &amp; potatoes here is the insane-o-in-the-brain-o family led by R Lee Ermey. In my opinion, everyone at the quiet and tranquil surroundings of the 'windmill' earns an FDA Quality Seal &amp; Top Round marks, even with their less than meaty dialogue.The movie had a lot of scary hooks in it, and I mean that quite literally. ("b-r-r-r-r","b-r-r-r-r").`Leather-face' shows himself at precisely the right moments, which is when you don't expect him too. I must have said the S word about 5 times. Not bad.....The hamburgers that I am eating, that is..No just joking again.Well, not really. (Raymond "b-r-r-r b-r-r-r")Going back to the acting for a second, R Lee Emrey stole the show as he was the master chef's gravy to the insanity. The Emeril Lagasse to the Commander's Palace. I knew we were all in for trouble when he shows up in his squad car, gets out and stews ... e-r-r.."spews" out something red from his mouth. His role as the supposed `Sheriff' was perfect, and reminded me of his even better role in `Full Metal Jacket' as the unrelenting, unforgiving fowl.e-rr..foul mouthed drill sergeant. He's as sharp as a knife in this movie, and is very cleaver..e-r-r-r.I meant to say `clever', in his approach. ("Queue-Com-B-r-r-r B-r-r-r")While the only not-too-clad libido-filled scene takes place at the very beginning, there was no doubt deliberate intent on behalf of the director to show Jessica Biel's breasts by introducing a lot of rain in the last 30 minutes. I guess the director must have thought she was a fine piece of meat. And make no bones about it, she did appear very tender to me too. (meow meow...hey wait a tooth-picking second! that's not a chainsaw sound!)However, Jennifer Veal....e-r-r..I mean "Biel"'s acting was a little tough and gamey, as she definitely needs further seasonings..e-r-r-.. I mean 'sessions' with her acting instructor. And there must have been at least 3 or 4 times in which she could have gained control of that damned chainsaw! For the love of God, or even for just an Omaha Steak, would you please pick up the chainsaw??!!!!The film editing was excellent, as all of the right cuts were made in the carving..e-r-r.I mean `cutting' room floor.In the end, I thoroughly enjoyed this tasty and satisfying meal of a movie. And if there is a moral to the story, it is this: If you are stupid, and you are driving through Texas, don't stop. And if you do stop, because you are hungry, do not ask for a vegetarian menu. They will KNOW you are NOT on their side of beef. And if you have a beef with management, you may want to marinade.e-r-r..seranade them after dinner with a tune from Lynyrd Skynyrd, but this time the song from them should be `That Smell'. And finally, if you see a crooked sheriff laying face down in the middle of the road, and the back of his shirt has a recent branding of the word `Goodyear', please take off and don't come back. Don't come back now, y'hear????By the way, my hamburgers were delicious.Grade: A- (95% lean)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Horror movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i have no idea how u can call this the worst movie of 2003, which some people on imdb have stated. Infact this is one of the better movies of 2003 if not possibly the best horror movie of 2003. Horror movies are rarley EXCELLENT. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a edge of the seat horror movie. I remember i watched this movie with 3 of my friends, one was scared a lot, but after the movie finished i was the only one to admit that it was a good movie. But if u like slasher movies i can bet that no other slasher movie is like this one. The guy that plays leatherface is like a 6'6 monster, he's perfect for this role &amp; usually u see the stupid slasher just walk after his victims while the victim is running for their lives &amp; somehow manages to catch up to them. At least this is realistic he runs like crazy after the victims. Better than any nightmare on elm street or any Friday the 13th movies or even the Halloween movies. I'll give this movie a 9.5/10 because it's what a horror movie should deliver. How hot is Jessica Biel</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very good movie but the original one is a lot better. What I like about the original version, is the way the actors get killed off one by one and the poor girl at the end gets tortured and tormented but finally gets rescued. What I like about this version compared to the original version, is when the teenage girl on the road that they pick up shoots herself in the head through the mouth. I thought that was so awesome and cool, just to see her brains splatter like that and all of the blood everywhere and to see the hole in her head. Maybe, they should do that with other movies that were done back in the 1970's, 1980's for example. Make a remake but it would be more modern and with different people and more scary and gruesome. If they would do that, I would definitely go see them. In fact, I would probably be first in line.</fullReview>

It's the exact same thing. Kids on a journey, hick town, middle of nowhere, everybody's in on it, blah blah blah.Oh, and don't forget to follow along with your horror movie cliche' checklist. What is wrong with this genre??? Why can only so few get it right. You want to watch a great "modern" horror movie? Go out and BUY 28 Days Later. Why buy? Cuz it's so friggin good you're gonna want it in your collection. Just pretend the last 10 minutes don't happen.Chainsaw remake? No plot, no point, no acting, no intrest, no fun. Just No. Save the 4 and change on a rental and buy a gallon of gas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary and boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A tepid remake of a true horror classic, this one goes for the gore and slow deaths, and about halfway through it loses any pretense at suspense or mystery -- and anything else, for that matter. Endless chases, endless chainsawing (far more than in the original), endless boredom. A first cinematic effort by director Marcus Nispel suggests he is not off to a good start, but then again the screenplay must bear its share of blame. The kids are not all that interesting, and in fact I'd say the five young actors in the original did a far better job of suggesting the terror of being hunted down by this wacko backwoods family. Skip it and watch the original instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Horror Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" on opening night. The theater was so packed that every seat was filled. After the movie was over I could not believe the outcome of the movie.It was freaky after the movie because we took the back door exit which led to a really white stairway. Everyone was afraid to go around the corner. My friend even pushed his girlfriend to go check instead of him. "TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE" (2003) IS THE BEST HORROR MOVIE EVER.There is not a movie in the world that could even come close to it because it was perfection. I am going to buy the movie as soon as it comes out(MARCH 30th).I strongly recommend that anyone who reads this should see the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only TCM movie I loved was the first one...all the remakes seemed to be a complete waste of film. But there was something about this movie that put it up there with the best in horror history.The new version had a lot more gore than the first one. The first one really left you thinking about what happened to the kids that where killed...in this one they show you. This movie also runs off a good story line. This and the first TCM are the only ones to do this. Not only that...it's been a long long time since a horror movie has made me jump and this one did in a few spots. So this movie is definitely worth checking out!!! What do you guys think?---------Travieso Being MaLo-------------</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems that every year around this time, America is suddenly in love with horror movies. This is, after all, quite understandable, as Halloween is the time for scary cinematic fare. The downside to that, is that every year around this time, we are subjected to far more horror crap than horror gold. We as an American movie goers have become so used to violence and horror, that it takes an awful lot to scare us out our desensitized pants. Texas Chainsaw Massacre is another failed attempt at that.The movie fails in about every way that the original 1974 film succeeded. There is hardly a cohesive shred of a plot, one that makes even less sense if you haven't seen the original. "Teens drive through backwoods hickville, get themselves stuck for some reason, do far too much wandering and snooping around for their own good, and then are chased, terrorized and cut into bits all while managing to wear formfitting tank tops." This pretty much descibes the pitch for about any cookie-cutter slasher flick that has come out in the last 20 years, and describes Texas Chainsaw Massacre perfectly.Now obviously there are going to be similarities to the original, as it is a remake. But this similarities are so surrounded by formulaic trash, it feels more like seeing an old friend or an old childhood home that has fallen into disarray in the 20 years since you have last seen it, making you long for the good old days. The 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre is too dark, poorly timed, and simply too formulaic. Granted, darkness is a hallmark of any decent scary movie, but this one was so dark that I often had trouble telling what was going on onscreen. One of the most terrifying images of the original is the final shots of Leatherface, flailing around in anger IN THE DAYLIGHT. For some reason, bringing such horror into the day brings it into the real world, escaping that imaginary world of night and crossing into the reality of light.What should ahve been one of the scariest revelations of the movie, Leatherface taking off his mask of human flesh, revealing his true face, was done barely half way through the movie, and without the weight or presance to milk it for it's true potential scare factor. Lastly, and most harmful to the overall movie, was the fact that the movie brought nothing new at all to the genre.There is nothing that I saw here that I haven't seen in half a dozen other horror movies. I'm not going to try to pretend that I wasn't scared at times, but only in the "BOO!" sense of being scared, not terrified. There is a big sense. Truly great horror films play the terror as a prominant character, just off-screen, making you feel that at any moment, anything can happen that will leave you stuggling to go to bed that night without the lights on. Movies that do that effectively often are able to do so without such gratuitous violence, and make the hairs on the back of you neck stand up whenever you think about them. These are movies like The Shining, Psycho, The Ring, The Omen, Session 9, and to a lesser degree movies like John Carpenter's In the Mouth of Madness, The Blair Witch Project, and the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This 2003 incarnation scares you just long enough to get you through the movie, and once the lights come up in the theater, all sense of fright is quickly erased.So in this last few days before Halloween, do yourself a favor: don't spend your money on a flimsy slasher remake with shallow scares. If you really want to be scared, see a movie that says more to your frightbones than merely "Boo!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is worse than Cabin Fever. It is worse than House of 1000 Corpses. It is worse than Underworld. In fact, it is worse than every horror movie in the last 10 years. I did not jump one single time, nor did I ever feel any semblance of suspense. But the greatest travesty this movie perpetrates is than it is not bloody or gory in the slightest. People get hacked to death with a chainsaw, but we never see it. Where's the splatter? Instead the filmmakers assault us with a cavalcade of bizarre (read: lame) hillbillies, trying to create some sensation of eerieness. They fail miserably. It is also impossible to sympathize with the victims; they are all annoying. The dialogue didn't help, but the kid with the glasses is the worst actor in the long sad history of bad horror-movie actors. I implore you not to waste your time nor your money. There should be a constitutional amendment outlawing horror movie remakes. This movie is the proof. IMDb doesn't allow it, but this movie deserves a 0/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm going to keep this short.This was a pointless remake of a horror quasi-classic. The kids look terribly out of place in terms of cloths and attitude and speak, and the acting is about as bland as can be. This "Gore-Fest" that was hyped to me is nothing short of a crap-fest. The only gory scene in the entire film is seeing what-his-face's leg get cut off by Leatherface. Other than that, it's one death after another, with a really unscary villain, and Jessica Biel lives for way too long. This scores about a 1.5/10 from me. And that's being kind, giving it points for mild creepyness. I can make $6.00 back no problem, but New Line owes me 98 minutes of my life, and I want them back, now!Just a Public Enemy said so well, "Don't Believe the Hype!".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Re-creating the Chainsaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 2003 remake of the original Tobe Hooper classic was the one modernized film that started off the remake trend until now. To this day I still believe that this film is one of the best in the remake group. It's not as shocking or disturbing as the original but it has a dark tone which gets some tension going which I found to be good. The story still follows the same group of kids who this time go to a concert and then get stalked and slaughtered by a deformed psychopath named Leatherface (now being known as Thomas Hewitt). The story sets in 1973. It was produced by Platnuim Dunes, being their first film ever. I am going to talk about the remake's pros, cons and I will also relate to the original if I must (In most cases I will).I decided to give the Remake a try since I loved the original so much, now it being one of my favorite films of all time. All in all, the Marcus Nispel film isn't as bad as some say it is, and after a while your eyes are perfectly glued to the screen, watching all of the horrific images unfold throughout, one after the other.What I really thought was great in this was his development of Leatehrface. Unlike Freddy and Michael Myers in the new films, Leatherface is not humanized at all which is a plus. It's better to keep slashers away from the back story trend and it was excellent to see Leatherface without a back story. I also like the amount of on-screen time the director keeps Leatherface on for. He's in the film for a right amount of time. Nispel also gave a brutal side to Leatherface which was nice this time round. The one little problem I have is the character is not a monster. He's still human in the original but not quite. Here he's a little more human when he takes off his mask. Even with that small nit pick, I really can't complain about the way he looked or killed people. All of it was good enough.Another aspect I thought was good which is hardly seen in horror rehashes anymore is the acting. Acting is really well done by Jessica Biel and the other group of kids. R. Lee Ermy plays a nasty, sadistic and mind playing sheriff which can really get under your skin. He pulls off a chilling performance which makes the film go up another point. The other characters such as Ol' Monty and the tea lady although unnecessary in every way possible (they serve no purpose to this film at all) didn't do too badly. Like the original also, the movement of the characters was paced really well, giving us an insight on what they were trying to do.I also like the use of some iconic scenes such as the hammer scene or the breaking of the door. Good, just not as disturbing or shocking. The chase sequences where pretty good. They went full on doing. They did at least five chase scenes. I enjoyed seeing Leatehrface chase after his prey. A major problem with the film is that there was no suspense or disturbing scenes. The mood was dark which was good to see but what made the original so terrifying was the certain sequences of scenes such as the dinner table or girl and meat hook scenes. Here it felt more action packed like many of the other slashers that we've been getting. This is the film flaw and really the only one. I would have given this film a little higher if this film was more shocking and presented things that were unexpected. The original had a weird, very bizarre sort of way at presenting itself while as the remake wastes no time into getting into the creepy factors.Steve Jablonsky also did an excellent job with the soundtrack score, probably the best out of all of the suites I have heard from Platnuim Dunes films, but what made the original much more disturbing, was that there was no music. The original film only had sounds such as screeching, pig noises, rustling and creaking. Jablonsky's score was tense but not scary.If they improved on those little aspects, it would have been a much more scarier film.The violence was brutal and all out nasty and gruesome which was a nice touch. The original's violence though is much more disturbing because of most of it is covered where the viewer will have to think for themselves.The other thin was the cinematography. The 1974 film was more shocking because of that particular aspect. It felt so 70's while as the 2003 film trying to go the same distance just couldn't get the same level of fear. It felt so grainy and realistic while the remake once again was just another good intense slasher.This Platnuim Dunes film is their best. It's way ahead of "Friday" and "Nightmare". It is also much, much better than the awful prequel, "Amitiville Horror" and "The Hitcher". "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" 2003 is definitely one fun film which does have a few flaws. It is definitely not a failure I am proud of it. It is one of the better remakes to come out in recent years and it was the film to start the whole re-hash trend. It's the film to basically reborn all the others, bad or not. It is an emotional ride which most fans of the 1974 classic should enjoy. I know I did.This film deserves a high standard 8/10.</fullReview>

While the original created suspense through its documentary feel, this version destroyed any by heavy-handed foreshadowing. 5.

Secondly the original had a disturbed feeling that the remake fails miserably in recreating, for example the looks of confusion and bewilderment on Gunnar Hansen's face, and the one foot in the grave grandfather. The replacement Leatherface's dirty looks and "evil" stare cannot compete, and do not compliment the character, and the extra characters do nothing to add to the movie. It was the subtlety of the original that made it the horror classic that it is, and the obviousness that makes this version truly suck.</fullReview>

They hacked this up (or maybe the director was trying to make it his own and not be true to the original film?) But in comparison...the hitchhiker in this movie is a girl and an apparent victim of Leatherface whereas in the original it's Leatherface's brother and in this the sheriff is the one who apart of Leatherface's family...also in this one...where's the family sitting down the have "dinner" together? There are a lot more things in this version that are extremely different than the original but I don't feel like naming them all.I give this a 2/10...it doesn't at all live up to the original!</fullReview>

This movie sucks of so many levels. The story is changed around but not to any good effect. A woman runs out into the rain with a white shirt on and no bra under it. But yet when her shirt get wet, nothing. The makers of this film set up a scene and then it doesn't pay off. They actually must have taped her up to not show anything. The gore in this film is very weak. The look of the film is more like car commercial then a horror film. Looks like a typical skip bleach type of effect.

		<fullReview>I have seen "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre." "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is a friend of mine. You, sir, are no "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."I cannot for the life of me figure out why people enjoyed this movie. It was a full-on, predictable bore and worse than that, it wasn't enough that it meant to just "re-imagine" the original film...it attempted to place itself in TCM lore as "the real story."Screw that.We're given one-dimensional characters with no motives, reason. Leatherface is stripped of any kind of real characterization. This is a soulless husk of a movie that equates sadism with horror and unfortunately, this concept doesn't work. If we cared about the characters, what happens to them would seem horrific. Instead, it just seems cruel and mean-spirited, like kicking a dog. Horror is the emotional reaction we're going for; for a film that really seems like it's shooting to rise above the genre it seems to be sinking quite well into the worst qualities of it.Here's an alleged "arty" film wherein the last half hour is spent finding ways to keep Jessica Biel's shirt wet, and so help me if you actually pay attention you'll see exactly what I'm talking about.And these may be the most damning aspects of it. The film is dishonest from start to finish, not once respecting the viewer. It's an offensive geek show masquerading as a serious horror film. The shoestring plot serves only to string unpleasant situations together. But it's shot as though they were going for something more. It's too haughty to be good exploitation, and too cheap to be good horror.I'm not too stuck up or soft for this movie, I own meaner movies than this. But the movies I've enjoyed ("Audition," "Freeze Me," the original "TCM") are at least willing to justify their content; this is just an ugly film, just an excuse to create characters and abuse them.This is quite likely the worst film I've ever seen. Avoid at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's been a while since I've seen a horror movie this boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I think of horror, good or bad, I think of at least some kind of action that keeps the slaughter going. When I think of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I think of a movie that was decent, not great, and it achieved a lot with very little. It was original, tense (mostly due its documentary-style shooting) and had a solid pace. The horror lied in the ambiguity around the family that the teenagers in the story encountered. Thus less was more - the suggestive decor of the house within which the murders took place was enough to let our mind wander into darker regions. And now we have the remake - a completely uninspired, entirely unoriginal (and this raises the question of the function of a remake in general), and generally humorless (tribute??) movie. I found the movie boring - I knew where the story was going having seen the original, and whatever was altered in this version was far too uninteresting for me to enjoy it. *minor spoiler* Yes, they added some corpse-play, some more gore, and a guy who was handicapped in the original is replaced by a guy who can walk (but wears glasses). Some more light is shed on family relations in the house upon which the characters stumble, a nonsensical (and unresolved) subplot (pertaining to the baby of one of the women) along with them. *end spoiler* But what exactly do these changes achieve? Absolutely nothing, except a mean-spirited teenage slasher film that mirrors thousands of other slasher films (and has some cool shots along the way). Yet gone is the ominous atmosphere of the uknown of the original TCM, and gone is its originality. Remakes are hard to do well, and this one fails entirely. Maybe if I hadn't seen the original I would have liked this more, or maybe if I saw the original again I would like it less - still, I came out bored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in 1985, I rented the original TCM while on vacation at the beach. As a kid, we had heard all sorts of rumors concerning TCM and I could not wait to see it. I was blown away. Never had I seen a movie do so much with so little (and so little gore!) After viewing, I was left with a sense of dread and revulsion that would not leave me for days. Now, let's jump ahead to 2003. In October 2003, my girlfriend and myself, after re-viewing the original TCM, went to see this mess. First off, this is supposed to be set in 1974, but none of the kids appear as 70s kids. I half expected one of them to whip out a cell phone. 70s retro clothes made in the 21st century are not the same as the original 70s clothes I remember quite well. Ok, I can overlook that. Possible spoiler- But to expose Leatherface without his human mask takes away all of his menace, all of his mystery. And to make it worse, we learn from mama Leatherface that her poor boy is just another VICTIM because everybody made fun of him in school because he had a skin condition on his face. We seem to have this obsession in our society that everybody is a victim and not responsible for their actions. The movie loses mega points for that nonsensical left-wing propaganda. My final analysis-You kiddies, i.e. Gen Y, go rent the original TCM. And for the record kiddies, this is not a real story as some of the dumb tenny boppers were insisting to each other behind my seat in the theater. Is is LOOSELY based on the crimes of Ed Gein, who also inspired Psycho, Silence Of The lambs, TCM, etc....</fullReview>

I'm not a fan of horror movies, but regardless, this is the worst of the worst.I'm aware that it's not supposed to be a movie where you like what is happening. Again I don't see that as an excuse to say that any of it is better than appalling. Yes, I thought the characters were vile and shocking. But that means nothing. Even if it is based on events, the concept of some guy going around and killing people is low quality. There are countless horror movies with that same plot. It's boring, unoriginal, and stupid.The violence was packed in as well, but that didn't really bother me. It was the dialog that was stunningly bad. It seemed like a joke, it was that awful. But then again, all of the movie was very much way below average.The only positive thing I can say about it is, if you are a fan of horror movies and basic plots, I can't see why you wouldn't like this. The bottom line here is to hope for a power outage while your watching this, because it might be the only thing that saves you from witnessing all of this detestable wreck.I very rarely rate something a 1, but this time I do, and I do so with pride. 1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Lets Get Her Wet"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I truly believe that was the only thing the makers of this mediocre horror film were thinking...this movie is so pathetic I am not even going to write a review just tell you the bad points...there are A lot! -Watered Down (I don't mind but, the title says it all, and the movie says nothing, there is no gore either) -Why Did They Make This Film (The original was made to protest the cruel process cattle has to go through in order to feed us, what does this one want to accomplish? "Lets get her wet") -Predictable (we all know who lives, the most famous person in the film...duh, but they write the movie so predictable, you know the heroine is going to live. Who is this girl "Jesus"?) -Dumb Characters (In my opinion the characters should not have been driving a van, but the small yellow short bus to their doom) -Bad Acting (really bad acting, not going to say anything else about that) -Doesn't Cring Induce (the original accomplished that...this one accomplishes getting Jessica Beil wet) All in all this movie is pathetic watered down (litterally "Jesssica like got all wet and stuff!") garbage. I would like to take a chainsaw to the makers of this film, but oh yeah the painfully boring leatherface can do that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary-go to the original instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a time when remakes were perhaps more welcome. This was the time when VCR's didn't exist (or anything that followed) and it was unlikely that regular commercial TV would ever play even an edited version of the original "TCM". You couldn't buy or rent copies of moves-this wasn't all that long ago folks. So, perhaps the ability to validate remakes had a much stronger argument than it does today. There just isn't anything new, exciting, or different in this from the original. If something "works" in this remake it was already done better in the original. Hey, you can go online, go to a video store, whatever and get the original. So why bother with this?I think the only folks who would watch this more than once were those too young to have seen the original. But to them I say-go discover the original first. In this case , since this isn't an effects-heavy movie (where there would be a big difference between the 1970's and 2003's technology)-there simply is no reason to go to this version. Almost nothing is changed from the original anyway...Even the questionable sequel's are more fun than this..Yes, even "TCM-The Next Generation"..However, even worse I fear is the upcoming follow-up "TCM-The Beginning"..please spare us......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" franchise had already been run into the ground long ago through indifferently made sequels (though Tobe Hooper's 1986 effort isn't as bad as generally implied), and now this atrocious thing. Hopefully the original filmmakers made some money off of this garbage. Whereas the original was a creepy, uneasy film with a crazed, nightmarish ending (and memorable final shot), this one is a stupid, clichéd, irritating and unpleasant mess. Whereas the killings in the original were generally quick, the remake features one long scene after another of people running from the chainsaw wielding villain, or running into people who are obviously in on the whole murderous enterprise. There is no tension, no suspense. The heroine is an 80s cliché: the good girl who won't take drugs, and even stops off at the end to save a little baby. The other characters are idiotic prettyboys/girls and southern stereotypes. The uncanny thing about the original film is that killing and eating people was simply the lifestyle of the family, in this one there seems to be some sort of vague "revenge against the world" plot (Leatherface suffers from some sort of skin disease, rather than just being a freak who likes to wear skins), and I can't recall cannibalism being mentioned once.The violence in the original was implied rather than shown, certainly for budgetary purposes, but that also lends itself to the overall atmosphere of the film. Here we have not one, but two scenes of the same character trying to lift himself up off of a meat hook that he as been skewered on. The filmmakers saw they could not craft a frightening, smartly made horror film, so they just stooped to making a tedious gore one. At least it all leads into the most obviously derivative ending in some time, a "Blair Witch" bastardization that almost has to be seen to actually be believed (not quite as good as the "Carrie"-like ending to "Pieces", where a seemingly dead character reaches up and rips a chunk out of the hero's crotch!). Once again Hollywood, thanks for another worthless remake, have fun with your dwindling box office receipts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Out the vast array of horror film remakes that are floating about picture houses near you, i feel this is the worst excuse for a remake of a film i have ever had to witness.I feel the production company for this film are solely interested in making money and not remaking a purely controversial piece of horror film history. People say this film has been given a glossy coating by Hollywood, in most cases concerned glossy means good! this film certainly isn't good or glossy. The grainy original is more glossy than this excuse for a remake of a film.Leatherface the main character of this film in the original is possibly the scariest psychopath ever represented in film history. Whereas the remakes take on leatherface is pathetic, it makes him seem pathetic not scary. Maybe if they had renamed him the seventh dwarf it would have been better received.I also picked up on the reference to drug culture in the first couple of scenes and thought this was an utterly pathetic and unnecessary representation of these people and shouldn't have been included in this piece of filth.This film remake has definitely made history, history as the worst represented piece of crap i have set eyes on. I am well and truly disgusted by this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An awful rehash of a horror classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1974 version of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was fresh, original and shocking.2003's TCM is directed as if it were a music video, with slick production, quick cuts and polished colours; it also stars Jessica Biel so is obviously designed to pull in the teenage audience. At many points in this movie, I wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry (I certainly wasn't scared) and even wanted to turn the TV off but decided to stick it out to the end - in hindsight, I wish I hadn't.I hated this version of TCM - it was lacking in artistic merit, restraint or originality. It is a paint by number horror movie which ticks most of the boxes: screaming girl, gore, a car that won't start, hiding in a cupboard, a strange looking kid....The original is a classic whereas the remake was just a nasty piece of film-making without any redeeming features. Do yourself a favour, rent the original and avoid this movie if you possibly can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far the worst movie I've seen in quite some time, and I've seen a lot. Sure, on the surface it combines all you need for a decent horror flick: a herd of brainless teens (including the sexy chick with the wet and ripped T-Shirt), a strange and murderous inbreeding version of the Brady Bunch (including the result of said inbreeding which is usually the insane killer) and the standard horror film environment (including an impenetrable jungle with the house of horror in it in which the usual glass containers with eyes and fingers are loosely scattered). Well, most of these movies have kind of a story, try to be scary or even try to entertain you. This one has nothing. It tries to sell you such a poor excuse for a story it wasn't even funny anymore. It was all senseless hack'n'slay, and since there was no sense of horror, it quickly became boring.Long story short: a waste of time and money. Avoid unless you are a fan of the hack and slay kind of movie with no need for a story.Rating 1/10</fullReview>

Now in terms of the horror films of the past decade I guess it was ok, but compared to the horror films of the past half century including the original it was horribly lacking. My biggest problem with the film was how long it seemed; it went no ware and took to long doing it. The thing was it kept using the same formula over and over again, run hide, run hide. After that I didn't find the thrills all that thrilling, in fact I thought most of it was tried and predictable. In the end I didn't feel entirely cheated, but I certainly was not satisfied.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The "New" Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a lackluster experience, to say the least. Of course, the source material is pretty weak to start with, as I've never been a huge fan of the original, although I've seen it on more than one occasion.In the original, there wasn't much characterization, to say the least. At least the original had the one annoying victim that everyone hopes will get it. In this remake, the 5 hapless youths are all downright annoying, to the point where I WANTED them all dead. This could be an interesting take, if done deliberately, but in the case of this film, I think it's just a case of shoddy scripting.The makers of this dullard of a film should have looked at either the X-Files episode "Home" that featured an killer in-bred hick family to much better effect, both in horror AND humour, not to mention emotion.Maybe they should also looked at House of 1000 Corpses, as it covers basically the same plot territory as TCM, but at least 1000 Corpses knows that the "plot" alone isn't going to carry the day.I really don't see any point in dragging out this review much more, so I'll sum it up this way. This movie would probably be best enjoyed by neophytes of horror film. Real fans of the genre should stay away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enormous disservice to the horror genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course its difficult to tamper with the original formula of a film that is inarguably one of the greatest horror films of all time. However, I didn't think it was possible to take a foolproof outline for what could have been a true-blue tribute to same, and ruin it entirely.On second thought, "ruin" may not be strong enough a word. "Insulting" is far more fitting. This film became a parody of it's predecessor within the first half-hour, and its all downhill from there. The lack of holding to the original plot, the paring down of the positively terrifying family to a watered-down 10-15 minute shadow of what they should have been, and the cheesiness of Leatherface was enough to insure that it wasn't worth the price of admission, let alone the integrity of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre legacy. It was easy to pick out the appearance of the slaughterhouse as a half-hearted attempt at trying to include TCM2 in the film, but it was "too little, too late". The writing was predictable and the so-called "scares" felt contrived. This is a prime example of why some remakes simply should not be done. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Don't bother renting it either - unless the only thing you're hoping to see justice done to is Jessica Biel's breasts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a mockery of every horror film ever made. Having no real plot, no story, no lesson, all it is is an excuse to show blood, guts and gore. The first five minutes of the movie went quite well, but from then, it all went down hill. The scenes do deliver some scares and thrills here and there, but scary images of people have limbs cut off aren't worth watching if there's no believable plot to accompany it. The film is dark, depressing, and gloomy. After watching three people get slaughtered, I learned to close my eyes when the graphic scenes came. Why should I expose myself to unnecessary violence if I'm not even going to get a good story out of it?I do admit I scooted to the edge of my seat for certain parts of the film. But after a while, even the chase scenes became boring and predictable.Girl runs. Girl finds an abandoned shack. Girl hides. Killer comes and looks around. Minute of suspense as killer gets inches away from girl's hiding place. Killer leaves. Girl lets out heavy sigh when killer jumps out of nowhere. Repeat. A half hour into the movie, I was inches away from leaving the theatre. Only to not be rude to my friend that accompanied me, did I stay. While driving home, I spotted a police car. I was very tempted to pull over beside it and report a robbery to the officer. My $9.50.I highly DO NOT recommend this film. It's filth, trash and a whole lot of red paint. Oh excuse me, blood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Multiplex massacre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not against the idea of remaking classic films. After all, nobody forces anyone into a theater to see them. I am disappointed, however, by the motivations behind remaking movies like this one. By very nature, it's unlikely that a glossy big-budget production could recapture the appeal of a low-budget hit from decades ago. If a film becomes a hit despite a lack of high production values, then obviously there is a very good reason for that. In the case of the 1974 "Texas Chain Saw Massacre", it was an unrelentingly grim and nihilistic atmosphere, as well as an ability to trick the viewer into imagining buckets of blood and gore when there was actually very little."TCM 2003" has some great images (courtesy of the original film's cinematographer), a pumped-up soundtrack, and an assortment of new characters. It's also unscary, uninspired, and unnecessary. The people who made this movie have distanced themselves from what made Tobe Hooper's original so effective, opting instead to fill their movie with familiar elements designed to trigger automatic responses in multiplex audiences.Set in 1974, this movie features a group of characters so contemporary in their dress and attitude that they seem to have arrived in 1974 via time machine. Our five massacrees make the mistake of picking up a hitchhiker, but that's where the similarity to the source material ends. Whereas the characters in the original had no real reason to believe they were in danger, these knuckleheads find trouble within the first five minutes, with ample opportunity to get away before the chainsaws start sawing off body parts. Instead, they choose to keep hanging around places that have everything except a neon sign indicating "DANGER, PSYCHO KILLER CROSSING". The new script piles on a lot of unnecessary baggage, weighing down the story's flight. Is it really that important to understand who the villains are, and why they are doing what they're doing? Did we need the addition of five or six bonus characters and a baby?The spookhouse quality of the original is trampled in this remake, which is too well-lit and glossy to be intimidating. The villains here are portrayed by actors who generate zero menace, especially the old man who seems to be channeling Granny from "The Beverly Hillbillies". It's not scary. There are some violent deaths, but no atmosphere of dread. Worst of all, there is very little suspense, the hyperactive editing defuses whatever dread the film manages to conjure up. Most of the 'attack' scenes are filmed in music video jump cuts, which is to say that it's impossible to tell what's going on, except for a series of harrowing shrieks on the soundtrack.It's not so much that I expected to be surprised by the events in this film, because everybody already knows what is going to happen before the movie even starts, but at least we could be terrorized a little bit. The new script takes some generous liberties in creating "new" situations, but it only serves to underscore just how pointless the addition of a "plot" to this movie is. Whereas the original had next to no plot and didn't need to compensate, this one pretends to have one and fails miserably at it. As it stands, the new ideas are unformed and unnecessary, serving only to pad out the moments until the next victim is killed. When it finally happens, those rapid-fire closeups take over, making it hard to tell what is happening on screen. At one point, a villain had an arm hacked off with a meat cleaver, and I had no idea--not because of poor lighting, but because of the epileptic visuals.If you have no love for the original, then maybe it's easier to take this remake on its own terms. Even so, I'm surprised by the positive remarks about this movie. I can't imagine how anybody could really find it scary. "Frustrating" and "pathetic" are two better adjectives that spring to mind. After watching it, I felt like I'd been had. I let my love of the original lure me into the theater to watch this big-budget attempt to recreate low-budget magic, only to be reminded of why that idea will never work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roger Ebert stated this remake of the classic 1974 Texas Chainsaw Massacre is, in his opinion, "vile" and "without social value." I have no choice but to agree. Every element which made Tobe Hooper's original version a classic is missing from this current travesty. There is not a single moment of cinematic style, believable violence and, the worse transgression of all, not one single moment of dread or fear. What made the original brilliant was its believability. The circumstances of this 2003 version, as well as the behavior of the characters, is completely absurd thus taking away its ability to scare. If you want to see a 2003 take on all the mystery, grit and believable insanity of the "Leatherface" character you won't be satisfied. Stick to the original!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How could they turn TCM into something so bad?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre (TCM) was a work of art. It subtly wound you round its finger, and then cut it off, leaving you unprepared for the gruesome fall. It was honest, and it made sense. It was gruesome, that is why it scared people, and everyone thought it was true, that is why it stuck with people. That is not the case with the re-make. The beginning has potential enough, the disoriented bloody hitch hiker, looking rather like Sally (Marilyn Burns) from the end of the original. She kills herself, splattering blood everywhere. This is where I noticed something was off. The original used straight forward shots. Beautifully composed, but they let you see everything. Not with the new one. The shots were good, but they hid the gore. Not a big deal, but a start. Then the kids get sent up to the mill. What? This makes the whole thing an elaborate ploy by the family to ensnare victims. In the original, the victims came to them. Then we find out Leather-face, has a skin condition?! What?! The original didn't need a p*** poor rationalization, he was just a crazy guy who killed, ate, and wore people. Plus the family in this was not nearly as clever, disconcerting, or SCARY as the original. The family (in the original) represented the different aspects of Ed Gein, who the story is based off. The Hitch hiker represented Ed's grave-robbing, the Cook, his cannibalism, and Leather-face, both the murderer, and the skin wearing transvestite. The new family had nothing to do with anything! Also, the new one relied on cheap scares, having Leather-face pop out at unexpected times. The original didn't need to do this. And this new one didn't have Grandpa! What the Heck?! Why this was allowed to be made (or be called TCM) I'll never know, but do yourselves a favor and save your nine bucks. Go rent Gigli, you'll be more scared by that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let me tell you a story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It involves 5 young adults traveling through Texas to go to a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert. A strange hitchhiker is picked up. She is bloody and is saying she just wants to go home.Now, this is the start of the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I need to tell you that this is the most horrendous movie this year. Possibly in the last few years. Not grotesque in the sense of blood and gore, but grotesque in the writing, directing and acting. There was no love for any of the characters. People applauded when Leatherface came onto the scene for the first time. No surprises. The story was too complicated (There is something about a baby that a family stole or something...my brain shut off about 10 minutes in)Horror films. The genre has seriously gone downhill. And that isn't saying much considering where it was before! There is a scene in the preview where the kids are standing outside and all of a sudden, a shadow shoots across the screen. Most of the audience screamed. It was so predictable. We were laughing more at the audience being suprised and scared by such mindless dribble.Now I am not exaggerating. I cannot believe that Michael Bay put his name on this film. The actors, director and writers should be ashamed of themselves. If it was a small independent film, I would understand. I have never walked out of a theater wanting to warn the people who were standing in line to see it that they should just cut their losses and go rent something good.I was not expecting much from this movie but I thought there would at least be some horror in it. Something to make my slumber not as restful as it was. I warn you that you should NOT see this film in any form. Maybe the original was better. Try that one. But do not expect too much. I hope Hollywood (or someone) starts coming out with scary horror movies. Not crap like this and The Ring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tobe Hooper and Kim Henkel's original pop-culture classic (1974) is not exactly an object of reverence to me but I do regard it with strong admiration and even a sense of awe. Gifted with certainly the greatest exploitation title of all time, the film is dynamically powerful in its utter rawness and trash vitality. It succeeds not in spite of the impoverished production circumstances but largely because of them.There's a magnificent collusion of the mundane and the imaginative alive in that film that lifts it into an octave of its very own. Through some mystical combustion of accident and talent, the original is a distinctive work of modern cinema art--not just because of museum validation. After decades of sequels and imitations it retains all of its vibrant potency.CHAINSAW MASSACRE 03 delivers everything it promises. The slick, crassly commercial new version replaces the original's suggestive restraint with the extreme graphic violence and blatant gore that will meet the demands of a jaded contemporary audience. It brings the iconic figure of Leatherface back to convincing life and manages to wring its quota of scares and shocks from material that has been worked to death. The film's not terrible. It's handsomely photographed by Daniel Pearl, who shot the original. It rates some credit simply for being, against all expectation, a reasonably effective teenage thriller. And yet, unlike the historic genre masterpiece from which it is derived, it remains, after all, just another movie.Rating: AVERAGE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent, but a little cheesy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First and foremost, do not let the title trick you into thinking you're about to experience extreme gore. Minus the suicide scene, the rest of the movie could have easily gotten a PG-13 rating. After that point all the kills are cut-off scenes. There is less blood than in the original than the (PG rated) Indiana Jones flicks. I cannot really describe how pansy-like the kills were done. Yes, a guy gets his balls cut in half?no, they don't even come close to showing even the after carnage, much less the actual event. They couldn't even show a chick get mangled by the chainsaw?you just see feathers flying from her coat, not even blood. The back cover says, "The most hardcore film of the year!" but it seems to forget that Saw also came out in 2004. Though the original Saw was far from a bloodbath, and by far the least gory in the series, it makes this movie look like a children's cartoon.Besides that insanely disappointing fact, the movie itself was well done . . . for about the first hour. The old man in the wheelchair, the sheriff, the calm-speaking old ladies: all that was gold. The first chainsaw attack was very suspenseful. The jump scenes were actually slightly creative. The horror staple, the slow opening that is meant to make you care about the characters, is well done.The main problem comes when you first see Leatherface. I wish they would have just left out the cheesy bits about him cutting off faces and sewing them up to his own. They could have just shown him have different severed faces, but no, they had to SHOW the lame cliché of him sewing them and such. I think that was when I lost all hope I could take this movie seriously. That cliché is used so many times it's no longer disturbing as much as cheesy. Yes, I know the original TCM was the movie that started the cliché, but they could have just cut around it for the sake of modern audiences. I would have taken the movie so much more seriously if I didn't have to keep myself from laughing at that scene. It gave me flashbacks to the cheesiest movie ever made: The Phantom of the Opera. Leatherface himself was slightly cheesy as well. Nowhere near as cool as he used to be.Though it seems like I'm being negative, I actually did like this movie. I'm just writing this to people don't get the wrong impression. (1)Do not expect a gory movie. (2)Do not expect an amazing well-done last 50 minutes. (3)You may find it quite cheesy at points because the directors were too stupid to leave out the clichés.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great film. I never saw the original though, so I'm not sure if it was as good or not. Anyway, I like the storyline a lot, unlike all of those dumb, original "slow, lack-of-education kids run out of gas and are killed by a guy with a knife" I think one of the really scary things about TMC is that it shows actual real footage of Leatherface!! Now that's what I call scary. Then, i think it's really cool that leatherface isn't really slow and doesn't just walk towards people, he actually runs pretty fast. Compared to "Friday the 13th" or Nightmare on Elm Street, this is a very good horror flick. I would like if there was a little bit more people that were killed because some people could think,for example," Texas Chainsaw MASSACRE? Wow, that must mean it's a gorefest with 20 people killed!" instead of what it is. I recommend this to people who don't like too much gore, and like scares.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original is a great horror classic, even when you can't see much violence (which makes you question why it is considered one of the most violent films ever made), and this is the remake. They have the same format of five teenagers: Jessica Biel as Erin, Jonathan Tucker as Morgan, Erica Leerhsen as Pepper, Mike Vogel as Andy and Eric Balfour as Kemper, and they are confined to a location near the road. On the way, a girl who escaped something shot herself in the mouth after she realised they were going in direction of what she had already faced. Anyway, later we discover the old house with Thomas Hewitt (Leatherface) (Andrew Bryniarski) and his terrifying family living there, all involved in sick and twisted torture of victims, taking their body pieces. Also starring Full Metal Jacket's R. Lee Ermey as Sheriff Hoyt. There is still the slamming of a victim with a large hammer, a victim put on a hook and the infamous chainsaw weapon, but in this film, you actually see some blood, including great moments of Leatherface cutting his leg, and Erin chopping one of his arms off! Look out for the severed head of idiot film critic Harry Jay Knowles from Ain't It Cool News. It was nominated the Razzie for Worst Remake or Sequel. Okay!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally...A good horror movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre tells the story of a group of five friends who are on their way to a Lynard Skynard concert. On the way there, they pick up a hitchhiker who seems to have suffered some sort of tragedy. When the hitchhiker shoots herself, the five friends stop in a small town to contact the police. Soon after, they are being hunted by a maniac with a chainsaw. It becomes a race against time as they try to escape. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is the first horror movie in years that is actually enjoyable.Though this remake will never gain the cult status of the original, it is very good in its own way. Horror movies in recent years have gotten stupider and stupider, and they were beginning to get boring. This remake is, at long last, a return to what horror movies are supposed to be. It features good characters that you actually root for instead of hoping they'll die sooner. I really enjoyed the plot to this movie. It is far more fleshed out than the original, and it makes a bit more sense. For instance, in the original films, the five friends stop for something to do, and they just stumble upon the house of horrors. In this movie, they have a damn good reason to stop, and they go to the house to phone the police. I wouldn't say this movie is actually terrifying. I'd call it more creepy. There are a few scenes that will make you jump, but otherwise it's more of a lurking creepiness throughout the film.The acting is pretty good. A lot of people have said the acting in this movie is terrible, but I suggest they watch the original before making that judgment. Jessica Biel does a pretty good job in the female lead. Her character is much better that in the original. She's stronger.Overall, this is the best horror movie in years, and in some respects, better than the original.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would be unfair to call this film bad, but it deserves a low end score because it is so disappointing and for totally missing the point of the original. To be fair I guess it is quite possible that this was made for a completely different audience. For all it's violence this still strikes one as a teen movie and the makers were clearly intent on drawing couples to the cinema to see it. Funnily enough it has always struck me as absurd that Tobe Hooper had anyone in mind when he made the first. It was just so difficult to watch and as for 'enjoy', well?. Here then we have a much slicker, much more user friendly affair and although there is blood and guts, we don't really feel it. We new pretty quickly that the lady at the gas station was up to no good and there was barley a moment that we believed in the sheriff or the family with the baby. And these things matter, without a feeling for the characters, a belief in what is happening and a sense of dread all we have is some Scooby Doo chase movie. The chainsaw was over used too and the only time it seemed the least bit creepy was the encounter of the girl on the road at the start. Sad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing I found out during this film is that its creators (the ones of the first version) were not mistaken in using the word "massacre". I don't know about the earlier picture, but with the technology now and the gore cinema fanatics, I can assure this is literally a massacre. Although the movie is bad, it won't disappoint the fans I'm talking about; it is visually explicit, violent and sanguinary, and as I (maybe not anyone) expected, completely nonsensical.It hasn't been long since I saw a film of this type, also a remake, called "House of Wax". I really don't want to make comparisons, but it becomes impossible since this piece has the same plot line and, in different terms, outcome. There are two couples here, as in "House of Wax", and the same kind of stereotyped characters with one exception; no rebellious brother. This leaves room just for the lonely and eccentric friend, who was played in this movie, thankfully and brilliantly by Jonathan Tucker; probably the only watch able thing to my eyes (of course, leaving aside Jessica Biel's whole body).Another thing; when I was talking about "House of Wax" I mentioned a movie of the same type that goes by the name of "Wrong Turn". Why? Because the screenplay didn't explain why the killers did what they did. I said I liked the script of the other film because it gave the killers a background story, so maybe we can think to ourselves about their motives; but not in "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre". We just have to assume that there's a man who's crazy and likes to shower people in blood, by any means; so does his family. There's something about deformed faces, but I don't take it into account.The new script by horror writer Scott Kosar inspired early plot resolutions, but better not talking about the plot, which is actually explained in the beginning. The rest is how it happened, but if you want to leave the theater feel free, you are not going to miss anything; just who dies first, who dies next and so on. Even the beginning has its own flaws; at least if they are trying to prove the film's inspired by a true story.To mention something extra about the cast, I wanted to express my gratitude to casting directors, for letting me see Eric Balfour's face before than the rest of the kids', so I could know he is doing good things with his career. Oh, and I also got to see that weird kid from "The Ring" again: Stephen Dorfman. And a woman who looked liked his mother, and other three old actors who looked as disgusting as their characters required them to be. Can you imagine a sadistic and perverted family? Holy Christ! Director Marcus Nispel takes a first shot with a full-length feature, as Collet-Serra did with "House of Wax". But Collet-Serra had a great eye for horror, and a great one for audience preferences. I mean, he subtly showed Paris Hilton and Elisha Cuthbert at their best, but I said subtly. Now Nispel didn't have a problem of putting Jessica Biel's jeans (from the front or the back) in front of our eyes more than twice (which was very nice by the way, but vulgar and without taste). Jessica Biel gives another chance to "getting wet and becoming transparent", her recognized acting technique since "Summer Catch". The girl never misses the opportunity, and it is appreciated, but she is still not an actress for me. The last words spoken by the narrator are: "The case is still open". It is shameful, truly. I can't believe they still think we're buying that "it really happened" crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In my opinion, watch it as a sequel and you will enjoy it with all of it's glorious violence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake is a raw version of the 1974 cult classic. I had my doubts before watching it because the bad reputation re-makes had, take as an example "Psycho" (1998), "The Ring" (2002), etc. "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (2003) has the basis of the original but is a stand alone movie. This movie is violent, brutal, 100% horror. I recognize Marcus Nispel's work because he made a brave decision in giving the franchise a touch of "extreme" violence (brave enough to create an R rated mainstream Horror movie) that was not present in the previous movies.There's suspense, great gore, an eerie atmosphere, but best of all, there's a high entertaining factor level. TCM version 2003 keeps you on the edge of your seat for more than 100 minutes. My beef with the movie is that it isn't scary enough as the original; it centers more on the Leatherface character as if he was Jason or Michael, and it relies much of it's impact on the gore factor. The original TCM didn't need of gore to become one of the creepiest and scariest movies of all time. The make up, gore, is great this time but it could use a lot more atmosphere. Anyways, the movie is a very good, solid Horror movie.The acting is great this time. You get to love and care for the teens, specially when they are getting their body parts chopped off. Special mention for the Police man. The man is a wacko whenever he plays a Lt. or an officer. He's a great actor. The atmosphere looks very menacing and scary mainly because of it's crude cinematography. Very clever Mr. Nispel. In my opinion, it's cinematography is what it gives the feeling of the original. The soundtrack is great also. There's nothing much left to say except that TCM 2003 is a great Horror movie that deserves a chance even from die hard fans and defenders of the original TCM. There's no place for black humor (part 2), or weirdness (part 4) in this movie, no, you can expect lots of gore and violence. The death scenes are great, high quality. I loved Leatherface getting his arm chopped off. Stuff for legend. Don't compare it point to point with the original because you may feel cheated (I mean, what was the deal with the female hitch hiker?! where was Mr. O Neill?!, and The Cook?, the old house?, etc.) but watch it as a sequel and it may work perfect for you. TCM 2003 did it for me.</fullReview>

Shaken by the suicide, the group seeks help from the locals, but their situation becomes even more surreal when they knock on the door of a remote homestead. It's quickly apparent the residents are a family of inbred psychopaths, and the unlucky youths suddenly find themselves running for their lives. In hot pursuit is a disfigured, chainsaw-wielding cannibal known as Leatherface.Starring Jessica Biel as the only "known" star, but I'm sure the others will have premising caries in the future.

		<fullReview>This film really disturbed me when i went to see it at the cinema. On August 20th 1973, police were dispatched to the remote farmhouse of Thomas Hewitt, in Travis County, Texas. What they found within the confines of the cryptic residence was the butchered remains of 33 human victims, a chilling discovery that shocked and horrified a nation. Now, for the first time, the only known survivor of the killing spree has broken the silence and come forward to tell the real story of what happened on a deserted rural Texas highway, when a group of 5 young kids inadvertently found themselves besieged by a chainsaw-wielding madman. One who would leave a trail of blood and terror that would forever become known as "THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE." A disturbing and frightening film. Not for the faint at heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The new Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which is something of a remake but not in the same vein as simply colorizing the film, as they foolishly did with Psycho in 1998, is another look into how audiences have changed since the early 1970s. The original Texas Chainsaw film was an instant success because so many people immediately condemned it as a grotesquely violent film that celebrated some of the most vile human behaviors imaginable. They were right about what it was, but as has for centuries been the case with literature, the fastest way for a movie to become a success is to be banned. Texas Chainsaw was never banned in America that I know of, but its reputation clearly generated much of the interest in the film. Today's audiences are obviously not as easily shocked.The film starts out great, with archive footage of a police walkthrough of the crime scene although all we really get is a look at a crime scene investigator walking down the stairs to the basement, noting things like fingernails and hair embedded in the walls. The movie then cuts to a group of kids driving across the Texas desert in the summer of 1973 to go to a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert, all the while rocking out to Sweet Home Alabama, which was released in 1974. Not that that matters. This is not, after all, The Alabama Chainsaw Massacre, and I haven't heard it, but I doubt that Sweet Home Texas is able to create the tone and mood as well. Besides, it's one of the greatest American songs ever written, although having that song in a movie like this is about as logical as putting $2,000 chrome rims on an antique tractor.(spoilers) The first turn that this movie takes from the original is that instead of a freaky hitchhiker joining the kids on their drive and giving the audience an idea for why these people are so messed up, there is a girl who has barely escaped from the family that these kids are about to meet. Kind of like what happened in Texas Chainsaw III. This girl has been so tormented by what she has been through that she is incoherent and ultimately tells the startled kids in the van that they're all going to die, then she pulls out a gun and kills herself.Speaking of which, here's an interesting thing to consider. She gets in the van wearing this little sundress, which has no pockets. After a while, she opens her legs, reaches into her crotch, and pulls out a standard issue police handgun. Just out of curiosity, where exactly are we to assume that she pulled the gun from? I doubt that she had a holster strapped to her inner thigh, and it's even less likely that she pulled it out of some hole in the seat of the van. Maybe they hoped people would forget about this logical oddity immediately, which would explain why we next get a view of the kids' shocked faces through the newly formed hole in the poor girl's head. The fact that the deranged hitchhiker was replaced by a victim does even more immediate damage to the film than the colorization of Psycho, and given the fact that Hitchcock preceded the original by not one but two films in color, I should have thought it would have been obvious that it was black and white for a reason. There is a duality to everything in that film, including the lack of color. Here, the removal of the hitchhiker shows how eager the film is to get to the blood and guts and skip over bothersome things like an explanation for the cause of the carnage that is to follow. It removes the story completely from any attachment to anything that might once have actually happened, and turns it immediately into a stupid teen slasher movie. The teens involved are gradually introduced to the infamous family as they search for a police officer who is interested enough in the girl's death to come out and check out the situation. The first member of the infamous family that they meet is an invention for this version of the film - a dirty little boy wearing Austin Powers teeth. The teeth are, by the way, so fake and so obviously bought at a cheap Halloween store that I'm still not sure whether they are supposed to be the kid's real teeth or if he just likes wearing them, like how some kids keep wearing their vampire fangs after Halloween's over. I'm not sure if this is in the film's defense or just another sign of its vain attempt to shock like the original did, but it does contain the most horrendous chainsaw death of any of the five Texas Chainsaws so far. I'm referring in this case to the kid who gets hung from the chandelier, although the movie also goes to great length to bring back some of the classic torture methods from the original, reminding me that I just don't like meat hooks. Since I don't work in a slaughterhouse and never will, I would be perfectly happy to live the rest of my life and never set eyes on another meat hook. In the movies or otherwise.By far the worst crime that the movie commits is that it turns Leatherface from a truly disturbed individual and into your basic movie monster. Consider the very end, for example, when we get a close up of his face as Erin is escaping, and not only is he growling, but his eyes have changed color. Earlier he took off his mask and we saw that he has no nose, then we saw him again later with a nose and with brown eyes, now he's got fluorescent blue eyes. I have one thing to say about this and most of this movie.What the hell?</fullReview>

Basically there was several ways I thought this could be great. spoilers!!! But here is what we got. This movie looked like a Staind video.

Who pick up a hitchhiker who kills herself in their van. How does this compare to the original? It cannotThe worst part about this movie is it doesn't go into the cannibal family really at all. I mean why is this even a remake you could have called it THE MISSOURI WEEDWACKER MASSACRE. Missed on all accounts.

		<fullReview>I read here people praising this film. I must say this really does baffle me! Why? Because it is such a bad movie! Okay, let's forget for a moment that it's a remake (basically in name only) of a well-loved and honored classic. Let's just take the line that this is another horror film pumped out of the dreamfactory by businessmen who have no love of film and certainly no respect for the people who go to watch them and see what we get; TCM 2003 starts with a black &amp; white sequence showing the events leading up to the story the film tells. Now, the film is set in 1974, so why would the footage be black &amp; white and look as though it was shot in the fifties? Then the film starts proper with Daniel Pearl's stunning but highly inappropriate 21st century pop art/video photography (I wonder if he shot Fairy Tales this well?) Then we meet our cast of characters who look, talk, and behave nothing like they would were they living in Texas in the early 1970's. So far so bad! Then comes the hitchhiker sequence with the ridiculous revelation of where the badly traumatized girl keeps the gun. Then the director has his camera zip out the hole in the girl's head and out the shattered window, and you know from there that this is going to be all style over content, in fact, he was so impressed with it that he does the same shot a second time. Then, from the moment the teenagers (cough, cough) decide to head into town and pull up at the service station to ring the police the film was in drastic trouble. First off they go to a place they were never given directions to, the Old Mill, and find it no troubles at all? Then they are introduced to a young boy whose character is solely in the film to help out with a few dodgy plot points. Then they go to the massive house on the hill, which looks like a Chinese laundry there are so many sheets hanging on the line. Why? Simply for visual effect! Characters are introduced but make no sense. And on it goes; they meet a sheriff who is so obviously a nutcase, although he does have a nasty sense of humour, which I liked, even though R. Lee. Ermey was miscast, as he's played the same character way too many times. Then Leatherface is introduced, and would have to be the lamest introductions in cinema history. Then when Jessica Biel escapes, after the ridiculous crap going on in the basement, she ends up at a caravan inhabited by two women and a baby. Now, from the moment we meet these two new characters we know who and what they are, but this still doesn't explain how they had the drugged tea already to go? And I could go on and on pointing out bad plot point after bad plot point, all the way to the less than stunning denouement.In summary: The acting was bad, the directing was worse, and the script was vile. The productions only redeeming factor was Daniel Pearl's photography, but even that was used in the wrong film. Where was Daniel Pearl when they were shooting Wrong Turn? Which was a fairly decent horror flick that definitely could have used a bit of inspiration in the photography department. Now, don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good horror film with a nasty streak of black humour and TCM 2003 had that nasty streak all right but cocked everything else up in the process. As a horror film TCM 2003 sucks. As a part of a legend it sucks even more. In my opinion most genre films today are absolutely woeful. Certainly anything made by Steven Summers, Roland Emmerich and or Michael Bay are huge piles of puss. The only trouble is their films, like TCM 2003, continue to make money. Dawn of the Dead shows how real filmmakers re-image a classic. Now, do you think it is too much to expect that the new versions of The Hills Have Eyes &amp; 2001 Maniacs (which should really be called 2004 Maniacs?) will be any good? Yah never know, but I doubt it.Snoggett</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every true horror-afficionado knows that the original TCM is probably one of the most memorable of horror-films(If not THE most memorable,at least in my book!!)with it`s wonderful and truly psychotic atmosphere.What then about this remake?It starts out quite good,and the first half hour or so I quite enjoyed myself.Good acting manages to convey a harsh and filthy realism;I`m thinking now of the beautiful scene in the car after they have picked up the distressed girl,and the realistic way in which the actors express their trauma.Sadly,the film all goes downhill from there,with the exception of the nice and sadistic Ermey-boy.He really holds the fort,you know!Could almost have been Jim Siedow`s brother(I`ll take that back,that was a sacrilege!!)Anyway,this is some of the "goodies" this film holds;the truly original idea of having a mystical brat leading the way out,pseudo-philosophical ponderings whilst faced with terror,truly embarrasing and over the top take on the whole suspicious-country-folk thing,pompous violins at some point,and the gore isn`t that much to write home about.Finally,the end came off as pure Hollywood-garbage.No sense watching this really,when we have the 1974-gem to hold us mesmerised!The filmmakers should have left it at that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) Horror Reviewed 5/17/04 Starring Jessica Biel, Jonathan Tucker, R Lee Ermy, Erica Leerhsen, Mike Vogel, Eric BalfourTo start off, I knew what I was getting into by watching this movie. I knew that it would suck, but then again, ever since Dawn of the Dead, I have been watching more horror movies. Dawn was great, Freddy vs Jason was OK, but then there was Wrong Turn (now that was a bad movie). But what about this one, which has picked up more flak then any of those three. Oh, how I hate thee. Let me count the ways?Plot: .5/2.5: (There used to be a lot more here, since this review is on my website, but I removed it due to spoilers) So many holes, so little time. There are so many times people should have died but didn't. Not to mention it follows stereotypes blindly, making sure anyone who did the drugs would get ripped a new buttpipe. Predictable.Horror: .5/2.5: Leatherface is not a scary presence. The half a point is for the cop. The cop is actually frightening in a kind of mortal way. It shows something when the accomplice is actually much more frightening than the maniac. Not bloody enough either. A couple legs get chopped off, but the blood feels unlike other horror movies, being the fact not only does it not gush, it does not show. Cowards.Acting: 1.5/2.5: Tucker and Biel aren't terrible, but really are nothing special. Same with the rest. Ermy is the only one who exceeds. He is the only redeeming quality in this movie. He brings kind of a ferocious evil to the character I can't see another actor doing half as well. But don't expect anything great from the other clowns.Entertainment: 1/2.5: Fans of the original may be disappointed (I have never seen it), but casual horror fans will not be delighted. Teens actually liked it, though no other demographic should be thrilled. Actually, according to the IMDb, females liked it more than males, and 15.8% of people gave it a 10. So maybe I'm wrong about this movie. Nah.Bonus: +.3 for the black and white: The black and white photos of the real Leatherface and the video are very well incorporated, making one of the only two saving graces. +.5 for Ermy: Ermy is the only credible actor in the group, and the character of the cop is menacing. The scene where he tells Tucker to show him how the girl killed herself, despite the fact that Tucker made a move a retard could avoid, the scene was the best of the film.Total: 38%: A crappy movie with a few saving graces that can't overpower the pure crappiness of it all. Avoid, but not at all costs. Really, it has a couple good moments. Too bad it still blows.Also See: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III, Freddy vs Jason</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whatever they want to call this - 'remake', 're-imagining', 'update' - it's better than the ridiculous and ridiculously over-rated original. Neither film worries much about character motivation or background - the kids are merely disposable hippies; just take it as read that Leatherface and his clan are homicidal lunatics. (In mitigation, Leatherface was allegedly mocked for being an ugly kid, but the ones I went to school with didn't take up power-tools against their oppressors.)Nispel cranks up the gore and tension that were sadly lacking in Tobe Hooper's film, and allows R Lee Ermey's psycho sheriff to steal the show. This is a wise move, as Leatherface is basically a big, lumbering galoot who - in the real world - would be out-run by all but the very stupid or the very unfit. This would obviously make for a very short movie, so the filmmakers give him the power to pop up unheard wherever he likes and hope that the audience doesn't notice.Jumpy, yes; scary, no. But certainly more entertaining than the version that was banned on video for 25 years here in Britain - for all the wrong reasons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film that paid respects to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, this film was fantastic. It was gripping, downright scary as Hell and one thing it paid its respects to the fans and the original. The screenwriter knew that there were things that he could not improve on or even duplicate. That's why they are differences in the remake from the original. The original captured magic and they say that lightning does not strike twice so why try. They made a film that updates the film for a modern audience because I've met plenty of people who would not watch the original simply because it was made in 1974. They were respectful of the original and did their best to honor it. Plus just because Marcus Nispel comes from a music video background, do not dismiss the guy immediately because he has an eye. If given the opportunity I would love to work with him. But back to the review, what this film did that none of the sequels and semi remakes did was make Leatherface scary again. No more was he a cross dressing scared little baby. Now it was more about resentment and pure, raw animalistic fury. Leatherface was human but his pursues were superhuman. He just would not stop and gives him a head and shoulders edge over supernatural killers like the Creeper, Jason Voorhees or what they multilated Michael Myers into. I loved the original film and thought that there was no way to top this and the remake does not want to top it but it wants to bring back the audience in the world of Travis County Texas and the skin wearing Leatherface. The performances in this film were great all around. Mike Vogel did a great job making an unsympathetic character into someone that almost made me cry to see die. The same with Jonathyn Tucker. But the heart and soul of this film was Andrew Bryniarski, R. Lee Ermey and Jessica Biel leaving her 7th Heaven image behind. This film scared me and we need more horror films like this in theatres instead of garbage like Darkness Falls or Jeepers Creepers 2. - Trent Gein</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreadful remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was truly one of the worst films I've ever seen in the past few years. It was boring, unscary, and painful to sit through.In the original, we were given great wide shots of the desolate Texas landscape to underscore the feeling of being stranded in the middle of nowhere with this group of kids. In Nispel's remake, we get nothing but dark, tight shots in which we cannot decipher any of the character's surroundings.The original gave us sparse dialogue between the characters--we didn't know much about them, and we didn't care. In the remake, we learn WAY too much about the characters that we could do without (it's horror--we don't need to like the people getting slaughtered).The original used a creepy, deliberate style of directing that built up the tension and dread into a series of psychologically disturbing scenes. The remake jumped right into the gore and just kept throwing in scenes that were supposed to be freaky, but ended up being detached and tiresome.What a complete mess this movie was. Not one scary moment; too many scenes that don't belong in horror films (c'mon, she saves the baby at the end?); pitiful directing and an overall lack of understanding about what made the original so great. When I saw Ebert's ZERO STAR review, I thought for sure that he was being too harsh. But after seeing this piece of crap, I fully understand where he was coming from.If you want to see an effective modern remake of a classic horror flick, see Dawn of the Dead (2004). But whatever you do, avoid TCM 2003 like the plague.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is all about 3 things: screaming teenagers, bloody chainsaws, and a whole lotta meathooks.Five youths are on their way to Dallas to get concert tickets or weed (Not sure which one, I was 20 minutes late). They pick up a hitchhiker telling them they're all gonna die and she then shoots herself in the head. The shaken teens go to a nearby town for help and make a fatal mistake by entering a large strange house. One of the guys wanders around the house and the audience is taken completely by surprise when Leatherface axes him in the back. Yikes! While this is going on, the teens are oblivious to the terror inside...until they meet up with Leatherface himself, and he comes after them with the the famous chainsaw.A curious thing about this film is the tagline: "Inspired by a true story". More like, "Loosly inspired by a story that has been hacked to pieces by countless urban legends." You won't believe how many sites I've seen about this movie with e-mails to the administrator like, "My brother was in jail with the real Leatherface". Sorry to dissapoint 12yr old boys all around the world but Leatherface is like the toothfairy: he doesn't exist.Overall: This was dissapointing film. Shockingly, I wasn't that scared by it. I saw "Gothika" later that evening and I got a lot more emotion out of that. Rent this unless you want a scare of the moment but it's nothing more than a fat guy with a mask.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uncomfortable Viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Texas Chainsaw MAssacre is a classic partly due to it's ability to instil fear in the viewer using simple techniques. It was not so much what we saw as it was what we didnt see that scared us. Sure, there were some grim scenes such as the girl on the meat hook and the infested kitchen but ultimately, Tobe Hooper used psychological techniques to scare his audience. Fast forward thirty or so years and welcome to Texas Chainsaw MAssacre of the 21st Century - a clever reworking of the original material. Marcus NIspel is obviously a big admirer of Hooper's version yet he also brings in his own ideas in order to make up for the originals lack of cohesion in narrative. Nispel keeps the blood pumping at all times. No sooner has the first character been dispatched of, are the next batch being primed for target by an unruly sherrif. The 1974 film occasionaly seemed like we were just waiting for the next thing to happen. You dont get much of that here. The blood and gore is relentless and this is one of the negatives of the film. It indeed makes very uncomfortable viewing and you feel quite exhausted by the final credits.The gritty filming technique pays homage to the original and this film also attempts to give a backstory to the reasons why old Leatherface wears his victims skin as masks..I won't spoil it but hey, its all good. And you can't fault the acting either. Biel makes a plucky heorine whom you root for, and supporting actors Tucker, Balfour, Vogel and Leehrson are all nicely fleshed out as her friends who one by one fall victim to the local hood! Even the most unsympathetic amongst them, who wanted to dump their hitchiking suicidal passenger at the start of the film, are made to be seen as resourceful and caring before their demise.So we all kinda know what is going to happen here, especially if you have seen the original. What makes this better than most remakes is the fact that it is not a scene by scene rehashing of a classic circa VAn Sant's Psycho. Extra scenes, more characters, story backlog and impressive sets- The Texas Chainsaw MAssacre 2003 throws up a few surprises and still leaves you horrified and jumping every five minutes and for that reason, i givethis a hearty 8/10. Just make sure you have a pillow with you whilst you watch!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible, horrible movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No, not Tobe Hooper's 1974 masterpiece, this putrid little film offers nothing as far as a "reinvisioning", unless of course your idea of improvements are rampant profanity, drug use, buckets of blood and the moderatly tasteful but nonetheless blatant use of the rather curvaceous assets of Misses Jessica Biel and Erica Leerhsen.This is a film made for those people who today think of a horror film as the latest cute actors/actresses, buckets of blood, soundtracks and the concept of suspense being a "scary noise". Acting is laughable it's so bad, with the exception of a wonderfully insane R. Lee Ermey.Why is Hooper's film a legend and this one a joke? Well, for starters, it's scarier when we don't know why. The explanation of Thomas Hewitt's (Leatherface) reasoning behind the killing is straight out of the Columbine report (he was teased). Secondly, Marilyn Burns' mad hysterics in the classic is offset by the humorous attempt at it by Biel and Leerhsen. Biel makes so much noise while trying to hide that I was about to grab the saw and show Hewitt where she was. There used to be 4 words against remakes of classics..they were "Gus Van Sant's Psycho". Now, (at least till I see the new Dawn) there are 5 "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2003"0 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Attack of the Horrible Remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First and foremost I have to say that I tend to dislike remakes regardless. Second of all I'd have to say that this one is one of the worst perpetrators of remake mistakes. The film completely forgets Tobe Hooper's original vision. The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre was, and still is, a classic horror film, not because of it's star power of excellent screen writing, but because of it's realism. The lead female character, played by Jennifer Beal in this remake, is not the empowered female figure this film portrays her to be. After seeing her friends killed and experiencing living hell, the character would more likely be suffering from a complete emotion and psychological breakdown rather than thinking and acting like an action film hero. The scariest part of the original wasn't the chase scenes or the violence, but the sick and twisted nature of the people who committed these crimes. We must not also forget that the family who butchered these teens were, indeed, real people, in one fashion or another. The remake takes a horrible true event and turns it into another Hollywood piece of garbage.All of this aside, we can also look at the fact that this new film completely bastardizes the original story. I realize that it was rewritten and adapted from the original screenplay, but several key pieces are missing. The lead female character was traveling with her brother, a fact taken out of the remake. The brother was also permanently tied to a wheel chair, yet one more piece of information taken out of the remake. In addition to this the very nature of the Hewitt family was distorted. The original didn't need a cast of six or more family members to scare the pants off of audiences. The way in which the family opperates was also completely changed. In the original the purpose of their killing was in order to supply meat for the roadside barbecue store. A truely horrifying idea when you think about it. This aspect was completely ignored which made the Hewitt's appear to be simply a family of crazed lunatics. And after all of this I believe that the camera focused too much on Jennifer Beal's chest.Over all I'd say it was a crappy remake. But more than that I'd say it was simply a crappy movie. There are far too many problems with this film for it to be taken seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It dont matter what movie it is that gets the remake treatment people will always say ``it is cr*p`` or ``not as good as the original``. Well in this case it`s better than the original way better the only good points to the original were: leatherface, and the atmosphere of it nothing else that stupid woman running around screaming all the time was so annoying she should have had head smashed in with hammer oh yes.she was so annoying more annoying that any other woman i have ever seen in a movie, just scream scream scream was all she did. we all expect some one in that position to scream but for Godsake not as much as that.anyway onto the remake:This was and is to me better and more entertaining than the original, not that the original is bad it`s just i think bigger budget better movie (but this isn`t always the case as we know - resident evil = big budget = cr*p, dawn of the dead = low budget = great.).but the remake is what Tobe`s version would have been like if he had more money, but the guy had talent as he showed us with the budget he had for the original.this one will be in my collection as will chainsaw 2 and 3 but not 1 or 4.what i am tired of is people saying ``oh the original is better and remakes and cr*p``, well most of the time yes they are but not in this case and just because just because the one Tobe Hooper did is the original doesn`t mean it is the best.this movie is slightly ahead of the original because of that stupid woman screaming which almost ruins the original she had talent she was in how many movies after the original ? yes sir her career rocketed after than movie.Jessica Biel is a better actress than who ever played the part of the original woman being chased by the leather faced one, better looking and not annoying and has more talent.they should have had Gunner Hansen back as the chainsaw welding nutter that would have been cool :), and the guy who played the dad of the family they should have him in a cameo as well.rating for this movie 9/10. rating for the original 7/10. rating for original leatherface 10/10. rating for new leatherface 8/10. rating for Jessica Biel 12/10. rating for that woman who ever she is that got away from leatheface in the original 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>slick gory remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 1973 Texas. Erin (Jessica Biel), her boyfriend Kemper (Eric Balfour), friends Morgan (Jonathan Tucker) and Andy (Mike Vogel) are returning from Mexico along with Pepper (Erica Leerhsen) on their way to a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert. They pick up a distress girl (Lauren German) walking on the side of the road. She shoots herself. The group goes looking for help from the sheriff. Instead, they find strange inbred locals, duplicitous Sheriff Hoyt (R. Lee Ermey) and Leatherface.This is a flashy gory remake of the 1974 horror classic. The critical panning that it took was justified for people who never liked the nihilism of this horror sub-genre anyways. Is it too much blood? For some, there can never be enough. There's no doubt that this is a good slick production. Jessica Biel is not usually a good actress. In this, she doesn't need to be. She just has to have that hot beautiful body. The young people get killed in grotesque fashion. There is that creepy rundown house. I don't mind people hating it on principles. To me, the movie does what it's intended to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far better remake than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Getting stranded in a small town on their way to a concert, a group of friends find themselves stalked and hunted by a family of demented locals and their hulking, chainsaw-wielding son and must find a way to get away from the group.This here is one of the more impressive films in the remake craze and certainly an outstanding film in its own right. One of the best facets here is that this one is a movie that actually acts as a true old-school horror movie containing that all-important factor, suspense. The suspense here is really dripping off the screen in several different moments, coming across pretty consistently here almost from the start as the fate of the hitchhiker and the sprawl through the car-yard on the edge of town cast a great deal of suspense at the beginning as it sets the stage for what's to come. The initial walk-through of the house itself are a lot more fun as we continually are aware of a threat lurking in the shadows, yet are unable to see anything, which is a great way of continuing that alongside the early scenes while also setting an effective use of atmosphere here. The best example is the kitchen sequence, hiding in a crawlspace through an eye-hole seeing the layout of the room waiting to see when he leaves, disappears, and waiting to see if the coast is clear suddenly comes crashing through from behind. That is such a great scene that works beautifully in here, and combined together with the setting, the camera angles and the actions on screen gives the film a grand jump that actually delivers. This even helps out the film's other big plus here with the outstanding action within this one getting some thrilling moments from the chainsaw attack on the kids in the car which is utterly thrilling as the blaring chainsaw and brutal kills come off even more-so as a fun scene, while the basement chase through the house and out into the back offers a bit more blood-and-gore in the killings. The mood here is just impressive, from the house to the basement settings as well as the rundown town and forested woodlands locations offering some great places to get some scares in, including a scene or three of some guy popping out of nowhere and touching the shoulders of a cast-member. With some demented moments and several scenes coming remarkably close to the original yet it has enough of its own voice to stand alone of it, there's enough to like here to overcome the small grips with the film. The main problem is the fact that there is such a small cast that is supposed to get killed off, it doesn't offer much of a body count. There aren't a lot of deaths in here, so that really hampers what could've been a large killing spree. The other problem is that the action scenes were edited so you can barely see what's going on. It's so quick-cut it takes several views to see it clearly. While the effort to slicken up and give it a glossy feel is a divisive effort depending on the individual due to their own individual tastes, the fact that this makes the movie more watchable and generally more entertaining can't be denied. It shouldn't matter why the film exists as well, if the motivation to remake it in the first place should be of some concern, but rather the film is around and must, be dealt with as such, and it's an entertaining effort regardless. As such, this one ranks as one of the better entries around.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and drug use.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So, I finally got to see one of the Chainsaw movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I live in Texas and I can absolutely assure you, what is depicted in this movie is right on. The people and law enforcement are just about exactly as portrayed.I really like Jessica Biel. She is a better actress than most want to give her credit for, and she has about the best looking butt on anyone. But she really doesn't need to do much acting here, as Erin, one of a group of 5 young adults traveling through Texas by car. They come upon a young lady, appearing dazed, wandering along the road. They bring her into the car for safety, and she promptly produces a handgun and puts the barrel in her mouth and blows her own brains out. Lifeless. Dead.This sets up all the rest of the movie, as they take her to find authorities to report this to, and have her body disposed of properly. But nothing goes as they would have suspected, and end up fighting and fleeing for their lives.The main villain is Jonathan Tucker as Thomas Hewitt as (Leatherface), who uses the chainsaw to try to kill his prey. They need to eat, after all! A good casting choice is R. Lee Ermey as the rotten lawman, Sheriff Hoyt .The whole movie is dark and damp, either rain at night or water in the cellar. They make good use of large meat hooks for their prey. For fans of this genre, it is very good. I wasn't particularly impressed, except by Ms Biel. But then she always impresses me.SPOILERS: At the very end when Erin, the lone survivor, finally gets away, at night in the rain, she is offered a ride by a long-haul trucker. But he brings her right back to the scene of the crimes. She manages to get away, hot-wire the police car, and run over Sheriff Hoyt as he is trying to shoot her. And she ran over him a couple more times for good measure. She was safe... until the next chapter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing that bothers me most about recent horror remakes is that they're all so incredibly similar while the source material was so diverse. How do you make "Friday The 13th" and "Texas Chainsaw" look like they're the same movie? I don't know, but director Marcus Nispel somehow found a way. The thing that made the original so effective was the grainy film stock, which made every event look even sleazier or more revolting than it already was. When you take that away, and add very bad leading actors, you take away all the charm. The new script doesn't help either, because the dialogues are just horrible. Just check out the opening scene, in which they try to explain everybody's back stories in about two minutes. That doesn't really work out. The death scenes are stilted and lame, the villains are boring even though one of them is freakin' R. Lee Ermey. There are virtually no improvements on the original, just a lot of setbacks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as it should be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger Ebert gave this film a shocking zero stars when he rated this film in 2003. I thought no film could be that bad, so when it was shown on Film4's FrightFest Season in 2009, I decided to watch it. I was not familiar with the story, but from the title, you can guess what it is about. I have not seen the original, so I have nothing to compare it by. I had watched the prequel (which was released after The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was released) the night before, to familiar myself with the storyline and the character Leatherface. I was not very impressed by the prequel and saw that The Texas Chainsaw Massacre had a higher rating on IMDb, so I expected it to be better, even though Ebert had failed to even give it a star.The movie opens with "real" footage of a crime scene and police reports of the terrible incidents that happened in Texas and zooms in on the evidence which is a chainsaw ... hence the title, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It then takes us to the main characters, teenagers, driving back from Mexico where they went to buy marijuana. Whilst driving, they nearly run over a girl. They stop to ask if she's OK, but she seems extremely distracted. She tells them she wants to go home and they decide to drive her. Half way through the drive she tells them "they are all dead." Confused, the teenagers asks her who is dead and she freaks out telling them they are "going the wrong way" and "she doesn't want to go back there." She then produces a gun from her crotch, tells them they "are all going to die," puts the gun into her mouth and pulls the trigger. We later find out that her family went through what they are about to go through. With a dead girl in the back of their truck, the teenagers decide to find a sheriff and pull into the big bad house where their nightmares are about to begin. One of the family members (R. Lee Ermey) poses as the sheriff and sorts the dead body out by wrapping cling film around her, groping her boob and telling Andy (Mike Vogal) that she is wet down there. This is all happening whilst Erin (Jessica Biel) is in the house on the phone to the police being told the sheriff will be there in half an hour. Her boyfriend, Kemper (Eric Balfour) on the other hand has been kidnapped and is being tortured by Leatherface. Even though the group know everything is wrong with the situation they are in, they still decide to sneak into the house to find Kemper and events start to unfold from there.The film is extremely boring. There's no suspense so you feel scared and there is no real character development, so you don't feel sorry for all the terrible things they are going through. Jessica Biel is extremely annoying, and it is obvious she has been cast for her beauty and her screaming skills. The beauty part is proved correct when her white top becomes soaked through and everything is visible, she might as well not be wearing a top.As the film progresses, you don't think, "Oh my God, are they going to survive?" You think, "Oh my God, when is this going to end?" I didn't care if they lived or died. I thought, just kill them all now or let them go, I honestly don't care! Just end! I can see why Roger Ebert gave it zero stars; it's dull, boring and a waste of time. The concept of the story line is good, it could be a fantastic film, but it's just not! I would not recommend this film. Instead, read the title, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and use your imagination on what happened because it will be a lot better than the film.</fullReview>

I'm going to start out by saying this movie is simply a pathetic laughable remake of a better movie. Its obvious that the director/producers went in to this movie just to make a couple extra bucks. This movie wasn't scary at all due to the unbelievable plot, characters and the endless horror movie clichés. My friend and I broke out laughing constantly at the bad dialog: (dialog like this sounds absolutely stupid in the movie) Morgan: How'd you learn to hot-wire a car? Erin: In Juvie.The whole movie is a few college kids but mostly Jessica Biels character running from a demented guy with a chainsaw. The demented guys family apparently doesn't care that this guy is ruthlessly murdering all these people and actually promote this activity. Its a pretty screwed up relationship and one of the many factors that keeps me from taking this movie seriously. This movie is so dumb that it could be considered MST3K worthy. People that write positive "10 star" reviews for this movie and constantly misspell Biels name as "Biehl" make me wonder why God hasn't smitten the human race.I like how its "based"/"inspired" from a real event. Yeah sure...what they mean is the screenwriter heard about a crime where some guy skinned people and decided to write a story that in no way relates to the actual crime. I gave this movie two stars because the beginning black/white scene was cool. Do yourself a favor and never...ever see this film and burn any copies that are in proximity of you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gorier if not better version of TCM.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I liked the original a bit more as it was more believable, but this one gets points for being a lot gorier. Sure there are going to be purists who don't care for it and for them the original will always be king, but that is okay, I just wanted to see a horror movie that didn't involve ghosts. This movie had a lot of in your face action and like I said, for me it was enjoyable. Horror is always going to take a back seat to other genres so you just can't get a super quality film, but as long as it isn't boring I will find something to enjoy about them. It also helps that this isn't a shot by shot remake, but rather the same titled movie that plays out much differently than the original. I like that as that way I don't know what to expect. Of course Leatherface is in it and there is that old thing with the family and how they see themselves as normal. It also has that drill sergeant from "Full Metal Jacket" and I always enjoy watching him. There are also more chainsaw kills in this one, which surprised me as I heard rumors there wouldn't be any in this one. So like it or hate it you have to admit that it was definitely better than TCM the Next Generation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Poor Remake of a Horror Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Texas Chainsaw Massacre(1974) is a horror masterpiece, it was a low budget movie that went against the typical Hollywood approach to deliver a true scare-fest.The remake is not the same case.In an attempt to cash in on the movie's cult status a remake was made that was everything the original stood against, predictable, boring, and bland, this movie does not deserve to share the same name as the movie it is remaking. The acting in this movie was decent except for Jessica Biel who is always a let-down so I wasn't expecting much more than C-grade quality from her.Pretty much everything was a let-down but what most bothered me about this movie was the style, it looked like a cheesy, lame, pseudo-horror movie and when compared to the original's grainy, gritty, documentary-esquire feel this movie whimpers in a corner.See the original, this one isn't even worth a rent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fairly successful 're-imagining' of the Tobe Hooper classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of teens (on their way to a Skynyrd concert) pick up a young woman they find staggering down the highway in a state of distress. When the girl decides to empty her brains all over the back of their van with a pistol, the gang stop to call the police.Told to meet the Sheriff at a disused mill, they drive to the deserted location and wait. However, he doesn't show, so two of the teens trek to a nearby farmhouse to make another call. It is here that they come face-to-face with the legendary Leatherface, a deformed lunatic armed with a huge chainsaw, and the slaughter of the teens begins.A slick, big budget reworking of Tobe Hooper's 70s classic, Marcus Nispel's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre succeeds as a scary, popcorn horror aimed squarely at the MTV generation. However, with its bigger budget and better production values, one can't help feeling that something has also been lost. The original TCM was gritty and realistic and I had no problem in believing that what I was watching could really happen. The remake, with its professional sheen and good looking cast dispenses with the sense of reality and suffers somewhat for it.However, it is the occasional lack of logic that is really this film's stumbling block: there were several instances where I questioned the decisions made by the protagonists and moments which had me scratching my head in confusion.Can a lumbering giant encumbered by a massive power tool really outrun a healthy youth at the peak of his physical fitness?Would you attract the attention of said lumbering giant in the hope of killing him with a cleaver before he can kill you?If you've had your leg sawn off and have then been hung onto a meat-hook, would you have the strength and presence of mind to try and lift yourself off?Would a member of a cannibalistic family risk his own life to save the teens? Surely other people are just 'food' to him!These points, and others which I have not mentioned, detract slightly from what is otherwise a very entertaining film. The acting is fine (R. Lee Ermey, in particular, gives a superb performance), the gore is impressive, and the sight of Jessica Biel running around in a wet vest certainly added to my enjoyment, but I think, with a bit more care taken with the script development, this could have been even better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can't tell this story too many times can you? Almost on the same level of excitement as the 1974 Tobe Hooper original...Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE will get your heart to pumping. Erin(Jessica Biel)and four friends are on the backside of a road trip to Mexico and are smuggling a sizable load of "pot" through 1973 Texas when their van almost hits a comatose girl walking down the middle of the road. No sooner than the mystery girl gets in the back of the van...she blows her brains out the back window. The teen travelers decide the right thing to do is report this messy suicide and get the hell out of Texas. No such luck. In short they meet a backward inbred family that gravitates around a huge hunk o' horror...Leatherface(Andrew Bryniarski)that lets his chainsaw do the talking...and slicing. Then there is Sheriff Hoyt(R. Lee Ermey)who seems to keep on being Sheriff long after there was no need for one. The repulsive Sheriff cops a feel of the dead girl's breast and also checks out the condition of her nether region. Nonstop tension, gore and maiming somehow blends with the coughing of the smoking killing machine chainsaw. Jonathan Tucker, Erica Leerhsen, Mike Vogel and Eric Balfour are a source of fresh meat for Leatherface and family. Biel is absolutely HOT. The girl has a top notch scream and knows how to fill out a tank top. Ermey is an absolute hoot. For the weak of heart this is a must to avoid. For horror freaks...this is a strong must see.</fullReview>

This travesty has so-called professional actors who are actually worse than those of the first movie. The level of sadism and violence is on a par with the later editions of Friday the 13th. The original left almost everything to the imagination; there are virtually no shots of flesh being pierced. Audiences left the theater traumatized, but also with a sense of exhilaration, largely due to Sally Hardesty's triumphant life-affirming escape. I never thought I'd say it, but this version of Chainsaw sucked worse than the remake of Night of the Living Dead. One walks away from it feeling dirty and repulsed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When 4 teenagers are traveling to a rock concert, driving through Texas after taking a stop in Mexico to get their illegal substance of choice, they make the mistake of picking up a deranged and unhinged hitchhiker, whom after seeing that they're going the way she really doesn't want to go, takes a gun out of her snatch and kills herself. Thus begins the yet another horror remake in a long LONG line of redone horror movies. And given my disdain for warmed over carbon copies of earlier better movies, i found myself unexpectedly enjoying this one...well to a point at least. The unmasking and softening of Leatherface was a misstep of massive proportions in my eyes and the addition of new family members reminded me more of the simply atrocious "TCM: the Next Generation" than anything else. Both of these things soured the movie a bit for me. However, I found R. Lee Ermey to be quite good in this film and compared to other remakes, it's still above average, if nothing close to the enjoyability of the high point of the "Dawn of the Dead" remake.My Grade: C- 2 Disc Platinum Edition DVD Extras: Disc 1) Commentary by director Marcus Nispel, producer Michael Bay, executive producers Andrew Porm and Brad Fuller and New Line co-chairman Robert Shaye; Second commentary by Nispel, cinematographer Daniel Pearl, production designer Greg Blair, art director Scott Gallagher, sound editor Trevor Jolly and composer Steve Jabinsky; Third commentary by Nispel, Bay, Porm &amp; Fuller, screenwriter Scott Kosar and actors/actresses Jessica Biel, Erica Leerhsen, Eric Salfour, Jonathan Tucker, Mike Vogel &amp; Andrew Bryniarski Disc 2) 7 deleted/ Alternate scenes (including an alternate opening &amp; ending); music video by Motogrator; Screen tests of Jessical Biel, Eric Balfour, and Erica Leerhson; the 72 minute documentary "Chainsaw Redux: Making a Massacre"; 2 stills galleries; a 25 minute doc on Ed Gain; 7 TV spots; Teaser &amp; Theatrical trailer; and trailers for "Highwaymen", "Willard", "the Butterfly Effect", &amp; "Ripley's Game" (it also has DVD-Rom content but I couldn't get that to work)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TCM remake is f***ing dumb. its written by someone who has no idea of horror and directed by someone who obviously has no diea of cinema and only knows how to direct music clips, which rarely contain suspense or horror (and i dont mean horror of the gore variety, i mean horrorific).....5 seconds before the end of each scene, you know how it is going to end, and you were always right... basically everything they changed in it from the original, they changed solely so as to make it more offensive and crude, rather than horrific or interesting. "we'll get rid of the sick weird frightening grandpa character that has freaked more people out than jesus, and we will replace him with some old war veteran with no legs who needs a cathatar to urinate. cathatars are gross and freaky, it'll make the kids wanna puke or something" ARRRRRRRRHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!! and then replacing hitch with some retarded typical traumatised comatose girl who then pulls a gun out of her underwear and blows her brains out!! what the hell! they made it as offensive as they could, instead of actually freaky and scary like the original opening. AND NOT ONE REFERENCE TO CANNIBALISM!! not to mention the screwing up of symbology. the original film is about the collision between the old decaying world and the new world, it is a social metaphor. the old world, its all there on display, we only choose to turn a blind eye to it, it is not actually hidden from view. the entire house is filled with horrorific degeneration and murderous activities. in the remake, everything looks normal, its all happy families and fine and dandy. no, all the sick stuff happens in the basement, frued's sub concious, the darkness underneath the happy exterior! thereby cancelling out most of the deeper meaning of the original. in this remake, they have removed the originalty of the first film, the meaning behind it all, and replaced it with the typical cliched all-american horror images and ideas, there by making it no different to films like valentine or i know what you did last summer. its all messed up. they ripped everything out of the original film adn replaced it with blood soaked fairy floss.... minus 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh How I Hate This Film.....Let Me Count the Ways.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I hated the original "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" in 1974 and my hopes for this one were bottom-basement to start with. Well I was not surprised at the end result in this gratuitous, ugly, worthless, mentally ill, stupid, uneven, boring, unwanted and unnecessary mess that, like many films of 2003, marks a new low for the American cinematic machine. The setting is Travis County, Texas in 1973, five young people (led by Jessica Biel, who I thought might have a reputable career after "Ulee's Gold") are methodically hunted down after a young woman commits suicide in their worn-down van. The hunter is a disfigured man only known as Leatherface, an individual who apparently went crazy after being diagnosed with a rare skin illness when he was just a boy. There is no real town around to speak of, just odd people and places. R. Lee Ermey ("Full Metal Jacket" fame) is the local sheriff who stands out among a group of inbred, distorted and totally crazed country-folk who all share the terrible secret. Basically a remake, this is not however the same movie (in terms of shot-for-shot) as the one from 1974. A few liberties were taken and the gore is much more intense throughout. There are several scenes that are stomach-churning (these scenes, as bad as they are, are the only jolts of energy found within) and I constantly wanted to turn away from the picture. The direction is terrible (big surprise), the screenplay feels like it was written by pimple-faced high schoolers who had gotten high on Liquid Paper over a long weekend and the performers (if you can call them that) just have no talent, pure and simple. I hate the film. I detest it completely and I shun an American movie society that would embrace an utter waste of my time and my money. Those who have any logic or intelligence about film should dismiss "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" as a very heavy hiccup, a sore in the history of film production.

Lee Ermey, David Dorfman, Lauren German, Terrence Evans, Marietta Marich, Heather Kafka, Kathy Lamkin, Brad Leland, John Larroquette (narrator). Bloody good remake to the drive-in cult classic horror suspenser based on true life events this time in rich color and an adrenaline pumping pacing with 5 friends on a Texas road trip that detour into a living nightmare involving a cannablistic family led by the chain-saw wielding bulky maniacal Leatherface with no hope of surviving the endless night of carnage at hand. Biel shines as the tough yet drained heroine screaming with the best of the past Scream Queens of the genre and smart enough to last the duration of her terror fueled survival of the quickest and Ermey is sadistic evil incarnate as the horrible 'sheriff' investigating. Heart-stopping moments of genuine jolts of shocks with a peppering of humor to off-set the graphic, effects riddled flick thanks largely to executive producer Michael Bay and newcomer director Marcus Nispel serve a gracious re-imagining of Tobe Hooper's scarefest, and kudos to smartly re-enlisting Larroquette as the sonorous narrator.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the original; loads of fun if you shut off your brain...or not.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Call me incredibly surprised: "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is a splendid delight--the type of horror film that fans of the genre have been waiting years to see. It far surpasses Tobe Hooper's low-budget original.Nope, this critic has never been a big fan of Hooper's "classic" low budget indie film from 1974.So when I heard that a remake featuring Jessica Biel was being made by a former music video director, I was not excited--to say the least. The months of production passed pretty quickly for this movie lover. Then the trailer came before I could even blink, and in less than what seemed a month or two it was already in theaters.Then I saw the movie earlier tonight and I found myself strangely absorbed in its characters and story--well, not really the characters, just the freaky updates implemented into the movie. Here we get nasty, gruesome exploitation of brutal murders that would make the Mansons cringe--so anyone who tells you that this film isn't disturbing is lying.Anyone who says it isn't scary is lying, too. Many directors mistakenly assume that gore automatically equals thrills and scares, but not in "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"--we get some pure, genuine scares here--the type of scenes that make the audience grab their arm cushions in suspense, only dreaming of what may come.But we also get loads of blood--enough to satisfy any Freddy or Jason fan. We get much more blood than the original Leatherface ever sloshed around on the set of the original movie. Still, it never overpowers the thrills. Well, maybe just a little.The plot: A pack of five teenagers on their way to a concert pick up a female hitch hiker who tells them, "You're all gonna die!" before blowing her brains out with a concealed weapon. (Which we later find out belonged to the town sheriff--hmm, what could this mean?) After stopping at a nearby gas station for help, the teenagers find themselves in an awkward position when a mutated backwoods hillbilly sends his chainsaw-wielding son after them. "Bring it on!" the cripple yells, pounding his cane on the floor of his house, before the infamous Leatherface emerges from behind a closed door and chases our heroine out the door, eventually slicing a man's leg off and sticking him on a meat hook. (One of the most realistic and gruesome scenes I've ever had the uncomfortable pleasure of viewing.)R. Lee Ermey is absolutely delightful as the corrupt "cop" of the Texas town--foul-mouthed and vulgar ("I used to like to get a touch," he says investigating a dead girl and fondling her), a sort of redneck version of his character from Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket": harsh and brutal.Biel, who I watched grow up on "7th Heaven," displays some talent amid the screaming of the cast. But unlike some of the recent so-called "horror films" where the characters are comprised of stupid, horny, busty and truly idiotic characters who run around with wet T-shirts and clasp their perfect cheeks as they scream, "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" actually takes the time to slow down and insert some true chills and thrills. And just like the original, it doesn't rely on sex and stupid characters as a fallback method. If anything, this version succeeds far past the original--and when I say that, I don't imply that it succeeds merely on one level.4/5 stars.- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very unpleasant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK--I HATED the original "Chainsaw". I found it boring and stupid with lousy acting, no script and no scares. This remake sure isn't boring, the acting is much better, it has a script and it DID scare me. It's not a remake...it's a re imagining.As the original, it takes place in 1973. Five college-age people are driving to a concert through Texas. They are the nice girl (Jessica Biel), the slutty hitchhiker (Erica Leerhsen), the annoying 'comic' relief (Jonathan Tucker), a studly but bland guy (Mike Vogel) and the take-charge guy (Eric Balfour). They almost hit a near comatose girl walking on the road. They take her in where she promptly shoots her brains out. They try to find the sheriff...and the nightmare begins. Purposedly shot in muted color this is a good movie...but extremely unpleasant. There is plenty of gore, screaming, yelling and (of course) good ol' Leatherface with his chainsaw. The scenes of him chasing the screaming kids through the night really scared me and the "treatment" of some of his victims was harrowing to watch. Also I jumped more than once. So it did scare me...but it was a real trial to watch. It's virtual nonstop mayhem after about 20-30 minutes in...and doesn't stop till the end. So I can't say I enjoyed it.The acting is very good. Balfour, Tucker, Vogel and Leerhsen are given little to work with, but pull it off. Biel is excellent as one of the last ones left--very convincing. R. Lee Ermey was downright terrifying as one of the maniacs. And Leatherface was a true nightmare.So, it isn't the sacrilege that most fans were afraid of. If anything, it's on par with the original.Recommended with STRONG reservations. Avoid if you don't like horror films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the best of the modern day horror remakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, it's pointless. Yes, the original didn't need an update and yes, this isn't as good as the classic film that spawned it...but, to be honest, I really like it anyway. One of the reasons that you can't remake a film like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre effectively is because it's the influence, not the film itself that makes it great - and you can't remake that. Rather than being a remake, I see this film more as being just one of the slashers that the original inspired, and the fact that it was made in 2003 is fitting; as it came about in middle of the reprisal of good, gory horror that this decade has seen a lot of already. The film does, of course, revolve around much the same macabre elements that made the original a success; with the chainsaw wielding leatherface heading most of the grisly action. This time, he's got a group of five, brand new kids to toy with. As you might expect, it isn't long before they encounter the horror that lie in wait for them; and we get to enjoy as they're horrifically mutilated one by one! One of the things that the original is famous for is the grainy film stock that it was filmed with. Naturally, this version of the film doesn't take advantage of that; but the 'MTv style' lavish camera work actually doesn't hinder it. The film is packed with lots of incredibly beautiful sequences - maybe even too many - but they are always nice to look at. The shiny camera also helps the film to distance itself from the original - which is a good thing if you ask me. Like most horror films these days, the cast is mostly made up of young actors. These guys actually do a decent job of leading the film - and ex-music video director, Marcus Nispel, has done a great job with casting the leads. Jessica Biel looks absolutely great in her cowboy hat - and she is joined by the amazing Erica Leerhsen; both of which light up the screen every time they're on it. The scenes of gore as disgusting as you would expect a film with the words 'chainsaw' and 'massacre' in the title to be. The scene in which someone has their leg forcibly removed while running through a load of sheets sticks out the most! On the whole, I probably like this a little more than most serious horror fans because of my disturbing love for the greatest melee weapon of all time; but basically, if you like your gore shocking and disgusting...you can't go wrong with this film, remake or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The (2003)** 1/2 (out of 4) Since most reading this already knows the basic story I'll keep this rather short. Also, there are many changes in the story, which shouldn't be given away so that's another reason not to go into much detail. The basic story is about five teenagers (Jessica Biel, Eric Balfour, Erica Leerhsen, Jonathan Tucker, Mike Vogel) traveling across Texas who wind up at an old farm house where they are terrorized by a deranged family including the leader Letherface and his trusty chainsaw.While there's no way this remake will ever gain the reputation of the original film, at least this one here did try something new and added new stuff instead of simply doing a scene for scene remake of the original. I know a lot of fans were worried that the story would be set in today's world and the director would use Scream tactics rather than what the original offered but don't worry, the film has the look and feel of something made during the 1970's but the rest of the film seems to be paying homage to the 1980's with its ruthless violence and over the top gore, which made this feel more like a Friday the 13th film more than anything else. Like those 80's slasher, the biggest problem here is that the director went with gore instead of actually trying to scare the viewer.As I stated earlier, a lot of the story has been changed from the original film and I think this has some good and bad. The good thing is that we are in for a new ride since new characters are added and we aren't really sure what role they are going to play in the film. The teenagers find themselves at the farmhouse for different reasons than in the original film, which is another plus. It's good that the screenplay offered a differentscenario because a constant reminder to the first film would have made this one even harder to watch. Another plus is an eerie opening sequence (perhaps influenced by The Blair Witch Project) where the narrator tells us what the story is and goes back to police footage of the crime scene. All of this new stuff helps us forget the original and realize that we're watching a different film that is an actual new story more than just a remake.Then comes the bad stuff. A new character is introduced at the start of the film and this character is the reason the teenagers end up at the farmhouse. While I respect the director for trying this angle, it simply doesn't work and this "shocker" plays a role throughout the first hour and really adds nothing to the film. This here also leads to a second problem, which is the amount of gore the film has in it. The original film, as well as other "scary" movies like Halloween, let the atmosphere and scenery scare you without having to resort to violence and gore. This new film has very little atmosphere and isn't too scary because the mindless gore scenes get in the way of anything that could possibly be scary. Seeing someone chased, with the right direction and style, could lead to some wonderfully tense moments but seeing someone get their body sawed in half with blood, brains and guts flying everywhere isn't going to do anything other than put a smile on your face wondering how the effect was done.This new film also has some fresh actors playing the leads, which didn't bother me too much. The original film had a bunch of unknowns and many think this helped the film and that's probably true but their weak acting always bothered me somewhat. This new film actually has a pretty good cast playing the teenagers. Jessica Biel does a very good job in the lead bringing a strong presence to the screen and she's likable enough to have us cheering for her throughout the film. Eric Balfour also does nice work here, although we all know he's just here for one reason. The big highlight of the cast is R. Lee Ermey of Full Metal Jacket fame. Ermey knows how to chew a scene up and spit it in the viewers face and he does his very best here offering some nice comic relief and he also manages to be a lot more creepy than even Leatherface.Since I brought him up, Leatherface here actually does more harm than good. This is the one part where the remake really can't hold a candle to the original. In the original film Leatherface was creepy because of how quiet and mysterious he was. The makeup of the added faces was also wonderfully done but in the remake you could say less would have been more. The face just looks too good so we're left with something that isn't scary and is too pretty to bring any scares. I would also add that his body structure is a lot more menacing than in the original film but nothing is really done to show this off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre starts on 'August 18th, 1973' as five friends, lovers Erin (Jessica Biel) &amp; Kemper (Eric Balfour) along with Andy (Mike Vogel) &amp; Pepper (Erica Leerhsen) plus Morgan (Jonathan Tucker) who is all on his own romantically speaking, are on they're way back from a trip to Mexico. As they drive through the American countryside they almost hit a girl (Lauren German) wandering in the road so they stop &amp; find her in a distressed state, they offer her a lift &amp; they all drive off together. As they drive the girl becomes more agitated &amp; scared at which point she then pulls a gun out &amp; commits suicide, shocked the friends decide to go to the nearest town &amp; report the incident to the police. It's not long before they come across a gas station where they try to report the suicide, this is just the start of a living nightmare for the friends as they soon discover that the locals aren't friendly including a huge guy known as Leatherface (Andrew Bryniarski) who likes to slice people up with a chainsaw...Directed by Marcus Nispel this is obviously a Hollywood remake of Tobe Hooper's 1974 classic The Texas Chainsaw Massacre which I personally think is an extremely overrated film &amp; one that I don't actually like that much so would I be more impressed with this remake? The answer is, quite simply, yes. In fact I'll go as far as to say I prefer this version in every single aspect &amp; that it's become one of my favourite Hollywood horror films of the past few years. The script by Scott Kosar takes the basic premise of the original but adds enough variation &amp; twists so that it's sufficiently different to stand on it's own. I liked some of the new elements, there's actually a decent reason why Leatherface wears a mask made of human skin &amp; the whole hitchhiker scene from the original is altered plus this time around it is far better &amp; much more effective, the new ideas actually add to the film &amp; story &amp; I also think it makes for a better flowing film. The script takes itself 100% seriously so there's none of those lame self referential jokes that have littered teen horror since Scream (1996), there's a time &amp; place for stuff like that &amp; The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake isn't it &amp; I'm glad the filmmakers agreed. The film moves along at a nice pace &amp; is never boring &amp; it actually seemed a very short film until I realised it lasted 100 minutes, it flew by it really did. I also really liked the police footage that bookend that film &amp; the cool shock final shot which I thought was particularly effective. I really like this one &amp; I'm not usually a big fan of Hollywood horror let alone remakes.Director Nispel does a great job, while the film looks a bit 'staged' at times there's a great atmosphere &amp; some great scenes. I loved a lot of the background detail like all the butchers hooks, jars of body parts, skin hanging from the ceiling, shafts of light that burst through gaps in the wall panels, the look of the house &amp; Leatherface's basement chamber of horrors are spot on &amp; it can be a pretty intense ride at times. The film seems shot with a slightly bleached colour scheme &amp; that also works great, there is a cool shot just after the girl commits suicide where the camera zooms back through the hole in her head &amp; out of the hole in the back window &amp; continues to pull back. You always felt that the gore was probably going to be somewhat tame &amp; there is gore here but more flashes than anything else, someone is impaled on a hook in reference to a corresponding scene in the original, there are various severed limbs &amp; body parts, someone has their leg sawn off &amp; the scene when the girl blows her brains out is pretty nasty.With a supposed budget of about $9,200,000, which I don't think is big budget as far as Hollywood goes, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is very well made &amp; has great production values &amp; special effects. The acting is surprisingly good as well, everyone plays it straight &amp; put in a good performance. R. Lee Ermey as the Sheriff is intense.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake was a hell of a lot better than I was expecting, as probably just about the only person on the planet who doesn't like the original I'm sure there are many out there who will disagree with me but I think Chainsaw '03 is better than Chainsaw '74 in every way. I was impressed, definitely worth a watch for those with the stomach. The other Chainsaw films are, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986) which I think is a fantastic black comedy horror, the decent but not outstanding Letaherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III (1990) which tried to be serious again with mixed results, the truly awful The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1996) &amp; the soon to be released The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning (2006).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't got that much of an opinion to share about this remake of the legendary Tobe Hooper film. It's rather well-made, fairly gruesome and reasonably tense. The young and inexperienced actors do a pretty convincing job while older veterans like R. Lee Ermey clearly amused themselves in their roles of deranged hillbillies. Director Marcus Nispel (ex-director of music videos, of course) makes the most of out the dark, colorless and depressing settings. The complete lack of civilization is the film's strongest aspect. Which brings me to all the negativity. More particularly: WHY?! ?Why?why was it made?! It's better not to wonder about this question too much. I'm one of them weird people who thinks the original TCM was one of the most important American movies ever and the most essential film to watch if you're a horror fan. And, if there ever was one film that didn't require a remake, it's this one! Still as scary as ever and the raw atmosphere of the original can never be equalled. The Texas Chainsaw Remake is nothing but an attractive money-maker?which is pretty much okay by me. This type of remakes, sequels and rip-offs is merely intended for young and over-enthusiast horror buffs. I think it's positive because they can find out about the original this way. Although, they better don't claim that this boisterous remake beats the Tobe Hooper original? That's like openly declaring you don't know crap about horror and you deserve death?by chainsaw!!</fullReview>
