		<shortDescription>The Nazis have never been mocked better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comedies rarely stand the test of time - this one does: one of the funniest films I have ever seen.When I was 16 (20 years ago, sigh...), this was re-released for a short time in a local art-house cinema, and my father insisted I go watching it with a friend. Well, teenagers don't normally line up to see 50 year old black and white comedies, but - man, was I glad I did!This is a pitch black comedy that feels as fresh today as it must have then; in fact, this must have been kind of a shock in 1942. There are no cheesy clean characters or cringe-worthy lines: this is a firework of fast, witty dialogue with an edge and the sexiest, cleverest (and most morally ambiguous) female protagonist I have ever seen in a film before the "New Hollywod" era.Even the structure and the way the story evolves are very modern; there are flashbacks and twists and turns that might be very common in contemporary films but must have seemed almost "avant-garde" at the time.The biggest fun, of course, is how Lubitsch takes the pi** out of Hitler's blind, fanatic followers. I don't believe the Nazis have ever been mocked better than in this comedy masterpiece (and I only hope old Adolf has seen it, too). Mel Brooks' remake is not bad, but the original is simply killer. See it, and then see it again (and again).Priceless. 10 out of 10Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the great romantic/satirical comedies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a famous review of this film by the late Sunday Times critic, Dilys Powell which begins 'Is the joke funny?'... what Miss Powell was getting at was that, given the horror of the Holocaust, it is appropriate to laugh at the Nazis. The answer is, ultimately, irrelevant to the viewing of this modest masterpiece.Lubitsch was, by this time, coming to the end of an exquisite career that defined the nature of sophistication in 'light' cinema. 'To Be or Not To Be' skips lightly over all of the minefield of a subject like this and it is difficult or impossible to think of any other filmmaker who might have managed it (if you look at Mel Brooks' limp remake, you can see why).In 1996, I presented a massive season of 'the greatest' films in Belfast for the centenary of cinema - 250 titles in 9 months. Of all of them, this was the film which got the greatest ovation - about 5 minutes with a nearly full house standing and applauding! They may have applauded for many reasons, but here are certainly some of them...The very complicated narrative is presented virtually flawlessly and the comedy is never allowed to hold up the narrative. The principle actors - Carole Lombard (breathtakingly beautiful) and Jack Benny in particular, but many of the supporting cast as well - throw themselves into the affair with a gusto that is completely infectious. Apart from the satirical aspect of the story and the way in which Hitler and the Nazis are mercilessly ridiculed for their authoritarianism and the fear which is their only motivator, the film pokes gentle fun at the vanity of actors in a warm and happy manner. Finally, and most important, is the notion of farce. Farce rarely works in the cinema, but here it does, and in the grand manner - just look at how many times the situation regarding Professor Siletsky changes profoundly during the film - it is dizzying - yet the characters manage to come up with (often self-defeating or inappropriate) schemes on every occasion.This is a wonderful work that, I have no hesitation in saying, is absolutely vital for anyone who wants to really understand the glory of the cinema. But to answer Dilys Powell's question... yes, the joke is deliriously funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A controversial classic that was actually made in 1941</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was made before while the US was still playin' both ends against the middle. Makin' huge profits while staying "neutral" The film was not allowed to be released until after, the US entered the war. Easily the best of the screen versions. The cast is tight and the timing is impeccable. You can really tell that the cast believed in the film. Since America had not taken a formal stance at the time this went into production the producers, cast, and crew were really making something revolutionary and controversial. So much so that the making of this movie was not even mentioned on the Jack Benny radio program. Which is a major deal for those familiar with Old Time Radio, Jack's film career provided excellent material for comedy writers on the radio show, but also the radio show was an excellent opportunity to promote a movie. It is doubtful that this was a missed opportunity, what is more likely is that his sponsor or perhaps the network did not want to advocate a position. This movie is wonderful for so many reasons. Not only is it hilarious, there is suspense, intrigue, and history. Another poster, mentions the Nazi's jumping out of the plane at the order of a radio transmission by Hitler. The thing to remember here is that the Nazi army was seen as an unstoppable war machine, so efficient, that soldiers would commit suicide if asked. This was less humor than it was to evoke fear of fascism.Everyone remembers Bob Hope and his travels during WWII, well Jack Benny and Carole Lombard were no slouches either. After all they made this movie. Carole died in a plane crash along with her mother and twenty others returning from a war bond rally before the film was released. Jack went where few if any cameras or radio transmitters could reach. He could be found in the most remote parts of the world entertaining the troops. Not to take anything from Bob, he went there as well, he just had more photo ops.Bottom line watch this movie--twice, maybe more, the dialogue is so quick and witty there is a good chance you might miss it the first time, them again it is worth at least to looks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film recently and thought id leave a brief comment,i found this original version better than the remake although the one with Mel Brooks is good as well.What i like about this Jack Benny version is that the humour is never forced,you can see the sincerity in the actors as although they are playing for laughs they are also saddened by the dark humour in their scripts,this film was probably Ernst Lubritsch's way of drawing the publics attention to what was really going on during that period in Warsaw,Chaplin did the same thing when he made the Great Dictator.Sometimes the best way to get your point across to people is through comedy as the horrors that were really going on during this time were being very played down by the press and the government and yet the public had to be made aware in some way.I found this a very intelligent comedy,in that its funny when it wants to be and yet makes sure you see its serious nature.And on the other hand making fun of your enemy is a great way of getting back at them.Great film a real pity that it was Carole Lombards last.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"In the hands of a ham"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has long been controversial to make a comedy out of war and tragedy, but often it is among the best ways of dealing with a difficult subject. Being able to satirize evil and imagine humour even in the most desperate of plights is a big part of coming to terms with these things. And when done in the right way, it can make some of the most compelling works that cinema has to offer. With To Be or Not to Be, director Ernst Lubitsch, who had spent most of his career making sophisticated and often innuendo-laden comedies with absolutely no political content, surprised everyone by tackling the most urgent of topical issues head-on, yet still maintaining the frivolous comedy style that was his forte.Co-written with Melchior Lengyel (who had provided Lubitsch with his earlier hit Ninotchka) To Be or Not to Be features a brilliant premise ? that of actors turning their skills to do underground work. As such it takes a light-hearted yet affectionate view of stage acting (which is where Lubitsch started out). This was a rather timely subject in Hollywood at the time. In the early days of sound, a lot of theatre actors had been called in to do the talkie business, but now the trend was shifting towards subtler, more naturalistic performances, as especially encouraged by directors like William Wyler and George Stevens. And there's nothing wrong with that approach ? Wyler and Stevens were making some excellent pictures ? but as a result the good old ham actor was becoming a somewhat marginalised figure. To Be or Not to Be makes the theatrical scenery-chewers into the heroes. The debate between the different styles is itself the subject of many of the gags, for example Lionel Atwill continually having to be reminded not to overact. The young Polish airman who woos Lombard is named Stanislaw, perhaps after Stanislavski, the nemesis of ham actors.The casting of To Be or Not to Be is like a celebration of the little hams. You won't find theatrical legends like Charles Laughton or John Barrymore here, but supporting players like Atwill, Felix Bressart and Tom Dugan are exactly the sort of people who were now a dying breed in the Hollywood movie. Here they can be seen at their unashamed best. The two leads on the other hand are not hams at all, but they were among the best comedy actors of the era. Jack Benny was ironically a master at underplaying scenes, often at his funniest when doing very little, such as drawing out the pause before beginning Hamlet's soliloquy. Carole Lombard was a consummate comedienne, often adopting a tone of complete sincerity that made little throwaway lines (like her enraptured "It certainly does (interest me)" when Robert Stack is talking about his bomber) sound comically ridiculous. But she could turn that sincerity to dramatic purpose as well, for example her very genuine look of trepidation when she is questioned trying to leave the hotel.And finally let us talk of Lubitsch himself. There isn't much to say about Lubitsch's direction here that I haven't said in one of my many other reviews of his pictures. One thing that is specifically worth mentioning now though is the attention Lubitsch gives to minor performers. Another feature of the more modern directors is that they gave very little screen time to bit players. The aforementioned Wyler would often get supporting players to do their scenes with their backs to the camera so as not to draw attention from the leads. Again this is not intended as a criticism ? it is right for Wyler's dramas. But Lubitsch was one director who always found a little bit of camera time for even the most inconsequential of actors. There are obvious examples in To Be or Not to Be with the many members of the acting troupe, but notice how in the scene with the Polish aviators in Britain, he treats several of them to close-ups. These aren't "face-in-the-crowd" close-ups that you might see in a montage. Instead it's as if each of these men has become a lead character for a few seconds, even though they will soon disappear from the story. But Lubitsch did not do this indiscriminately. In the scene where Lombard passes on the photograph at the bookstore, there are two Nazis in the background. We don't catch a glimpse of their faces, we just have to know that they exist. It seems that when Lubitsch lingers on a character's face he does so out of affection. And that is really the attitude that permeates To Be or Not to Be ? contempt for the villains, affection for the heroes, even through all the wit and satire. It is this ideal that really makes that fusing of the tragic and the comic work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Film! (But...)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I enjoyed this movie a lot, there's one thing which REALLY bugs me. The IMDb editors wouldn't accept this as a "Goof", but I can't let it pass without comment...The plot requires that Maria meet with Sobinski in her dressing room while Joseph is delivering the "To be or not to be" soliloquy from HAMLET, III:i. But since since Maria is playing Ophelia, THIS CANNOT BE. Ophelia is IN that scene, both immediately before and immediately after Hamlet delivers this 33-line speech. It's doubtful that she leaves the stage at all (there are no stage directions calling for an exit and re-entrance), and she would CERTAINLY be no further from the stage than the wings.OK, OK, I'm being anal. It's creative license, and like I said I DO really like the movie. But still, it seems like this ought to fall into the category of "Factual Error", even though it's a forgivable error.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swan Song in Warsaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1940 the American public was shocked when Charlie Chaplin released his first all talkie movie THE GREAT DICTATOR, in which he lampooned Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. Despite the new European war, we were yet still at peace with both Axis states. Hollywood, with rare exceptions (BLOCKADE, CONFESSIONS OF A NAZI SPY, ESCAPE) had been gingerly tackling the Nazis and Fascists. Yet public reaction to THE GREAT DICTATOR was odd. It had a big box office success, and yet many were appalled because it chose to say Hitler could be laughed at. Chaplin's response was that if he had been laughed at to begin with he would never have become such a threat.Actually other voices were beginning to stir in Hollywood. One was the great comedy director Ernst Lubitsch, who poked an occasional jab at the Nazis. Lubitsch had to wait until 1941 for a full assault on the Nazis - TO BE OR NOT TO BE, a film that looked at the German invasion of Poland, and it's occupation of Warsaw. It had an interesting cast. The lead went to Carole Lombard, who had many comedy performances under her belt. She played Maria Tura, the leading lady (and wife) of "that great actor" (as he always prefaces his remarks) Joseph Tura. Joseph is Jack Benny.Of all the leading men in her career, Lombard never played opposite one who was really more of a star in a different medium. Typical co-stars for Lombard were John Barrymore, Fred MacMurray, Cary Grant, Ralph Bellamy, William Powell, Robert Montgomery, Clark Gable, and Fredric March. Here it was Benny, who while he had a string of movie credits was basically a radio comedy star (and later would be a television star). His best films (GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT HERE, ARTISTS AND MODELS, CHARLIE'S AUNT) were not record breakers at the box office. In fact, while his performances were good in these, he did not necessarily shine in them (Laird Cregar, in one simple moment in CHARLIE'S AUNT, got the biggest laugh of the film). Nobody realized that his performance as Joseph Tura would be his best one, and that within two years he'd make his final starring fiasco in THE HORN BLOWS AT MIDNIGHT.Benny and Lombard proved to work well together as the egotistical, but oddly loving couple of theater hams. In fact the actors making up the Tura company are all good, including Lionel Atwill (who briefly is seen playing Claudius to Benny's Hamlet), Felix Bressart as Greenberg (who dreams of doing the Shylock speech from THE MERCHANT OF VENICE), Tom Dugan as Bronski (who hopes to play Hitler on the stage), Charles Halton as Dubosch (the stage manager, and the head of the Warsaw underground), and Maude Eburne as Lombard's cynical maid Anna. The screenplay did give plenty of time showing the difficulties and tensions of a stage company working together, and of handling temperamental stars and their egos.While putting on a play lampooning the Nazis (whom Benny and the others dislike), the government of Poland (Frank Reicher) says that due to the growing problems with Germany the play can't be produced. So the troop put on Tura's production of HAMLET. Benny as the Prince of Denmark (giving the great soliloquy) goes through the proper steps, although knowing the comedian from Radio one expects him to start it with "WELL!". But he finds that a man in uniform (young Robert Stack) leaves his seat in the middle of the third aisles just as he begins, "To be or not to be...." He does not know (until later in the film) that Stack had arranged to do this to keep a rendezvous with Lombard in her dressing room. Subsequently he treats her to a plane flight (he is a Polish Air Force pilot). When war comes he and his fellows fight, but the survivors make it to England. The grimmest section of the film is the occupation scenes. Like the comedy in THE GREAT DICTATOR, because we know what actually happened these scenes seem slightly unreal. But in 1941/42 they still get the fears and difficulties of the occupation across. Signs of stores and streets we saw hanging normally earlier are in ruins (including a delicatessen). The theater is boarded up. Had Lubitsch wished to do a tragic film he could easily have done so. But he allows the situation to blossom into a black comedy.Stanley Ridges plays Professor Siletsky, a secret German Agent who has fooled the Allies into going back to Warsaw. He has the names of families of the pilots. Stack is sent back to Warsaw to stop him, and contacts Lombard who helps. Soon the entire theater group gets involved. But will their theatrical egos blow their anti-Nazi plans? That is the running theme of the concluding portion of the film. Also along for the ride is Sig Ruman as Col. Ehrhardt, the Gestapo Chief who relishes the name "Concentration Camp Ehrhardt", but who keeps running afoul of Professor Siletsky (it is the Professor, isn't it?), when he makes seemingly harmless comments about Hitler. His reaction is usually to yell for his adjutant, Schultz (Henry Victor), whose whole purpose is apparently to be there to be yelled at.The film was a great success, but the death of Carole Lombard in a plane crash a month after it was shot cast a shadow over it. Yet it was a fitting swan song for that divine comedienne's career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interestingly, when the serious and tragic theme of the Second World War used as the basis for a great comedy. From this point of view it is difficult to separate the horrors in people's lives and the way that fashioned this comedy. Comedy based on the tragedy is not entirely correct thesis. TO BE OR NOT TO BE is extremely brave, required and great project. The title is not a parody phrase from Shakespeare's works, but alluding to the existence and struggle for survival.Frivolous and inappropriate descriptions are that only correspond to the characteristics of the genre. Hilarious fun theater company in Warsaw trying to outwit the Nazis during the war. This is enough to man peed with laughter. Not pertinent, but it is necessary.The film can be seen as shocking joke, making fun of the Nazi approach and spectacle, but certainly not anti - Polish propaganda. The characters in the film do not cease to be what they are. They are actors. With good acting, improvisation, ingenuity and courage, winning terrible enemy.Carole Lombard as Maria Tura, an actress in Nazi-occupied Poland was a brave woman, an actress whom everyone admired, and we all know that the charm of a woman can be a powerful tool. The funny thing is in the film, no one can "break" other than her husband. Although, it is in this case quite helpless. Jack Benny as Joseph Tura, an actor and Maria's husband. He is "the first line" of ridicule. Uncertain is in itself and turns a fool several times. But in the end he shows to us his "great acting". Robert Stack as Lt. Stanislav Sobinski, a Polish airman in love with Maria is a handsome soldier and lover required in the script. Felix Bressart as Greenberg and Sig Ruman Col. Ehrhardt are hilarious. One wants a role because it is only created for her and the other for their mistakes "that can not be counted" always blame his servant.To be or not to be is fun movie. It has a hilarious story, great dialogue, acting and good scenery. I am aware of the other side, which may have the opposite impression. I think the aesthetic and spiritual this movie does not offend anyone who passed all the horrors of the Second World War.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hilarious Comedy that is Overlooked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is surprising how funny To Be or Not to Be actually is. It does not make a mockery of ALL Nazis seeing that the main villain is smart and cunning, but it does make buffoons out of the high command or enlisted Germans who follow orders blindly without questioning the logic behind the orders. The Germans who are fooled are fooled by nothing other than an acting troupe with Jack Benny at the helm, showing the Germans as buffoons who take in information at face value.As the movie begins, the audience laughs at the ridiculousness of the acting troupe performing as the high command under Hitler's third Reich. This comedy is interrupted by a soldier becoming infatuated with Tura's (Jack Benny) wife to the point where he thinks they will have a future together. This relationship finishes setting up the first act, and the audience regains the gift of comic relief when it is the acting troupe who must save Tura's wife and bring down Hitler's high command as their identity is nearly compromised.The humor in the film has a wide range. At times it consists of Jack Benny complaining, but mostly the humor deals with the dramatic irony that the German command is unaware of the acting troupe's true identity. The troupe moves along with its plans with great ease as most Germans take them as fellow Germans and do not see past the costumes. Making the Germans puzzled is almost as wacky as watching a Marx Brothers movie, but it is not exactly the same type of humor since the Marx Brothers deal with rapid-fire jokes and physical comedy such as matching action to make characters believe they are looking into a mirror. In the case of To Be or Not to Be, the actors lead the Germans to believe they are dealing with officials, creating a similar illusion to the "mirror" antics of the Marx Brothers.An interesting notion of this film is that it was made at the time of the war, but does not induce fear of the enemy (Nazis) at any time during the film. Showing that the enemy can be imitated, and that, in fact, Hitler is "just a man with a little moustache," it illustrates how little people had to worry about the enemy at that point in time by portraying the enemy as buffoons, not unlike Chaplin's The Great Dictator.To Be or Not to Be is a great, overlooked World War II comedy, and while it may not be up to part with The Great Dictator, it deserves more attention.3.5/4.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Age becomes this little gem shot in 1941</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With topical movies, timing can be everything. With "To Be Or Not To Be," there was good news and bad news. The good news was that it was written and produced in 1941, before America entered the war following the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7 (but after the Sept. 1, 1939 invasion of Poland -- which, unlike some European countries, put up a brave fight). The bad news was it was released shortly after, in early 1942, when Americans, now facing the barrel of German weapons, did not find the Nazi menace so amusing. The New York Times movie review by Bosley Crowther (who usually was on the mark) found the humor of questionable taste, saying there was too much Jack Benny in the role: "But it is hard to imagine how any one can take, without batting an eye, a shattering air raid upon Warsaw right after a sequence of farce or the spectacle of Mr. Benny playing a comedy scene with a Gestapo corpse. Mr. Lubitsch had an odd sense of humor?and a tangled script?when he made this film."But without Benny it would have been a different movie, and, frankly, too somber and sad to be bearable, at least today. If it had been released before Pearl Harbor, the reviewer might have found Benny perfect for the role. And if the movie had been released in 1943 or 44, it might have been viewed as a brave defiance of Nazi might, and just the thing to lift spirits and boost morale.To watch old movies is to be faced by a quandary. Back before television resale rights or DVD revenue, it was make or break based on ticket sales, so an average director's first priority was to contemporary audiences. To appreciate an old film, it helps to understand the times of the contemporary audience, in this case, the outbreak of WWII. But a great director like Ernst Lubitsch probably was not just thinking about "today" when he made the film; presumably, he was thinking about the audiences of tomorrow, when the war was long over, won or lost. "To Be" is also a message in a bottle to the future. Here is what director Peter Bogdanovich had to say:"For Lu­bitsch, the Nazis' most damning sin was their bad manners, and To Be or Not To Be survives not only as satire but as a glorification of man's indomitable good spirits in the face of disaster ? survives in a way that many more serious and high&#x2011;toned works about the war do not." (Lubitsch's influence extends far beyond Mel Brooks, according to Bogdanovich's essay, to Hitchcock, Billy Wilder, and essentially all of modern Hollywood. To understand this film is to see why.)Today, the movie seems to have the right balance of humor and pathos, and to work on many different levels. Today, we can laugh at "Mr. Benny playing a comedy scene with a Gestapo corpse." But it works best if you understand the times, The War. What most people today know about World War II they learned from watching movies. And so they see "To Be" within the memory matrix of other movies. What you need to do is study the history of World War II, watch some of the fine documentaries, read about it, in books or online. We have all heard about "concentration camps." In 1941 concentration camps like Auschwitz were not yet used to implement the Holocaust, but to punish German political prisoners and for victims of countries invaded by Germany, like Poland. My grandparents were not picked up by French authorities and sent to Auschwitz until 1943. It is sad that some people in Europe are so ignorant of their own history. **From the Wikipedia article on Auschwitz: "The inmate population grew quickly, as the camp absorbed Poland's intelligentsia and dissidents, including the Polish underground resistance. By March 1941, 10,900 were imprisoned there, most of them Poles."If you understand history you will understand the deep sadness hidden by a smile in "To Be." Footnote: About 25 minutes before the end, the camera shows a list from the appointment book of Col. Ehrhardt. 10:30 reads: Maria Tura. 10:45 reads: Schindler.- - - ** I wish to extend my sympathy to any student foolish enough to take Dr. Jacques Coulardeau's classes (which I certainly hope are not in history or geography or film) at the Sorbonne, or wherever he actually teaches. Dr. Coulardeau, in his review, asks a truly bizarre question: Why, if the Allies knew about the concentration camps, didn't they stop the "massacre"? Dr. C.: Maybe it had something to do with the concentration camps being inside Germany and occupied Poland, and Germany wasn't issuing tourist visas to American soldiers. I would like Dr. Coulardeau to explain why French officials collaborated with the Nazis in sending French citizens, including my family, to their deaths in concentration camps? America didn't start WWII, but it was American troops, not French, that ended the Holocaust.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An acting troupe joins the resistance movement in Nazi-occupied Poland. This is a scathing farce masterfully directed by the incomparable Lubitsch, one of the earliest anti-Nazi films. It's hard to watch this without thinking about Lombard's tragic death soon after filming was completed. She shows for the final time why she was one of the premier comediennes of the silver screen, delivering laughs with her uncanny timing and delivery. Benny has the role of his career as the hammy actor whose love for Lombard is exceeded only by his love for himself. Lubitch not only provides sparkling comedy but also adeptly executes the action scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first Jack Benny film I've ever seen, though I knew who he was at a young age due to Warner Bros. cartoons. Without reading any back-story or plot for this movie, I watched it online today and it was marvelous! When it was released in 1942, most of the public found it distasteful to satirize such horrible events as Nazi-occupied Poland. And, after the initial comedy in the acting troupe with the main characters, there was no comedy for a while, so I wasn't sure if this was suppose to be more serious or what, but I'm glad it ended the way it did.I laughed out loud too many times to count. That's a rare thing these days where a picture can get you to laugh hard without using any obscene jokes. Jack Benny is a master and after having grown up hearing his voice in cartoons, I felt right at home with his character.The basic premise is that due to a mix-up, a handsome aviator played by a very young and almost unrecognizable Robert Stack falls in love with Mrs. Tura, played by Carole Lombard. Then a Nazi spy masquerading as a professor leaves Britain for Poland with a list of people for the Gestapo to round up, sadly and mistakenly adding Lombard's name to the list. After Mrs. Tura is detained by the Gestapo, it's up to the acting troupe, headed by Jack Benny(That great Polish actor, Mr. Tura) to use countless disguises and double-crosses to outwit "Concentration Camp" Ehrhardt played so delightfully by Sig Ruman. Ruman might even steal the whole show from Benny.As a side note, I found many similarities between this film and Inglourious Basterds. Now, Tarantino may or may not have seen this movie, but he undoubtedly saw the Mel Brooks remake, which begs the question "how much was he influenced by the plot when making Basterds?" Don't rent this--buy it. You will get plenty of repeat laughs from this great feature. So glad I stumbled across it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fellow Of Infinite Jest ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... as Shakespeare didn't say of Ernst Lubitsch but may very well have had he lived in the 20th century. This was one of his last films and one of an unbroken string of 'classics' including Bluebeard's Eighth Wife, Ninotchka and Heaven Can Wait. At least one person writing about To Be Or Not To Be here wondered in print if Billy Wilder had a hand in the screenplay; whilst it's easy to see why someone might think that the answer is no - Wilder, of course, co-wrote the screenplays for both Bluebeard's Eighth Wife and Nonotchka - though the whole premise of the movie is very Wilderian, a Black Comedy about the rape of Poland by the Nazis actually shot whilst the violation was taking place, as good a definition of inflagrante delicto as any I know of, this is compounded by the rape of Shakespeare by a ham actor, Jozef Tura a dream part for Jack Benny who was a better actor than he was given credit for having for years played on radio (and later television) a character light years away from his real persona. Just as Wilder would do in his own films - The Apartment, for example - Lubitsch switches effortlessly between laugh-out-loud comedy and the real drama of a nation under siege and having selected a consummate group of actors from top-billed Carole Lombard to the cream of supporting players such as Sig Ruman, Felix Bressart, Stanley Ridges he got the very best out of them and even Robert Stack in a thankless under-developed role wasn't a total loss. A brilliant comedy that still stands up today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course they probably wouldn't have gotten it, or even Hogan's Heros.Never again will there be such a class combination of Benny, Lombard, Lubistch and seasoned, well-loved character actors rolling along in this vehicle perfectly suited to their foibles. Anyone with even a little high school drama production or a small love of the theater will eat this up. "Get the pigs out before you drop in the ham!" Sad that Miss Lombard died related to the war effort, I can almost picture Gable sitting with the window open in the rain as in Gone With The Wind.This was Mel Brooks before Mel Brooks, Strangelove before Strangelove.Daring, yes it was. The only way to relate this to today's young people is if all the best-loved SNL comedians in just the right combination were to pull off such a feat, but I doubt they could - no wit compared to this cast nor the class -- too crass. So hat's off to the Golden Age of Hollywood, which never shone more brightly than in "To Be or Not To Be".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most people have seen Mel Brooks remake of this movie, so it is like watching Jack Benny doing Mel Brooks. It was clearly the best movie or performance Jack ever gave - all of his radio, television and movie works combined - HE IS GREAT! Of the two movies, Jack beats Mel hands down, but had it not been for the remake most people would never have know about this one. The death of Lombarde right after this movie caused it to almost become totally lost - a shame as she is great here as well. This is a must see for many reasons - Jack, Carol, the laughs and the tears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sardonic, hilarious and tragic. One of the finest films the 1940s has to offer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first taste of Ernst Lubitsch and one of the greatest films I've seen in a long time. To Be Or Not To Be doesn't waste a moment. It's one of the most impeccably paced films of the 1940s that hits every beat and leads down unpredictable paths. Instantly you can feel the heat of Billy Wilder's admiration for Lubitsch as they share similarities in a simple shooting style, love triangles and sardonic dialogue, and in a way To Be Or Not To Be does it better than Wilder ever managed. It's a battle of egos but they're deeply human underneath, balancing dry humour and tragedy beautifully. This is simply one of the funniest, intelligent and most poignant films of the 1940s. It's got a lot of bite and a lot of character. Lubitsch's brand of satire will be one to watch for me.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's often overshadowed by The Great Dictator, which preceded it by two years and was technically the first American WW-II themed comedy, but To Be Or Not To Be deserves the honor both for being the first comedy to refer to Hitler and Nazi Germany by name, and also for being made while the US was very much an active side in the war. It's still incredibly funny, but it's much more impressive, almost shockingly so, when you realize that it was made while Hitler was alive, and just how powerful it was back then. Carole Lombard is show-stoppingly terrific, and it's probably the best place to see her talent on display, since sadly it was her final performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a fine film from Ernst Lubitsch. Jack Benny is an egomaniacal famous actor in Warsaw, and Carole Lombard his unfaithful actress wife, when the Nazis take over Poland in 1939.The plot involves secret information, impersonations, spies, clandestine trips back and forth to England, assignations with Carole Lombard, and -- oh, let me recount how the featured assignation works.Lombard is visited in her dressing room by a young and animated Robert Stack, an bomber pilot in the Polish Air Force. He's been sending her flowers for days and is overwhelmed by her presence. He boasts of his exploits and she melts while listening. When he's leaving, after she agrees to see him again, he tells her he's never met a real actress before. She replies in a throaty voice, "I've never met a man who could drop three tons of dynamite in two minutes before." (Lubitsch pulls this stuff off with aplomb.) The agreement is that they will meet again in her dressing room for further conversation, so to speak, during her husband's recital of Hamlet's soliloquy -- "To be or not to be, that is the question." Every high school kid knows it because it's perhaps the best-known line that Shakespeare ever wrote.So, we see the performance of "Hamlet" with Robert Stack in the second row. Jack Benny enters, alone, pauses, closes the book he's holding, and looks up soulfully. It's his great moment. "To be . . . or not to be --", he begins, and Stack stands up and shuffles his way noisily out to the aisle to be with Lombard. Benny stops talking and gapes at him.This goes on for several nights in a row. Benny has no idea why the same officer stands up and leaves at the same point in the soliloquy. It's driving him nuts. Finally, with the main plot underway, Benny is unable to perform Hamlet again until the end of the movie, on the English stage. He strolls onto the stage in the same puffed-up manner, folds his book, and begins. "To be . . . or not to be?" And a British naval officer in the second row shuffles his way out.I don't want to get into this because I'll give away more gags, and the plot is complicated and has several surprises tucked away in it. Sig Rumann gives ample support as a comic Gestapo officer. When the movie first appeared, it was excoriated by some observers who felt that the Nazi conquest of Europe was not in the least fit as a subject for comedy. Fortunately, the Allies won the war and we can now sit back and enjoy this radiant comedy without feeling the guilt of the contemporary audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To Be or not To Be is Carole Lombard's last film before her tragic death in a plane crash and Jack Benny's finest. Another special thing about To Be or not To be is that it made fun of the Nazis ? so much so that some were very uncomfortable seeing it. There are few films that can boast this daring achievement ? making fun of Nazis in the midst of World War II. As well as succeeding at making some people uneasy, it also succeeded at making many laugh.The story of To Be or not To Be about a theatrical company in Nazi-occupied Warsaw which is preparing to perform an anti-Nazi melodrama. Maria (Carole Lombard) and Joseph Tura (Jack Benny) are cast as the leading roles. However, the Polish government cancels the play as they are afraid it would have disastrous consequences. So instead they perform Hamlet, and when Joseph Tura is speaking those immortal words: "To be, or not to be", he notices a young man, Lieutenant Stanislav Sobinski (Robert Stack), slipping out of the audience. He is, in fact, visiting Maria Tura backstage. When war breaks out, Sobinski makes it to London to fight with the RAF, and the Turas stay in occupied Warsaw. Hilarity ensues when Maria Tura is captured by the Gestapo and to rescue her, Joseph and their friends dress up as Nazis.This movie is absolutely hilarious, witty and clever. When I was watching it, I was dumbfounded that anyone could think of such an intelligent story which kept you constantly guessing as to what they would do next. Ernst Lubitsch manages to handle such a delicate, fragile issue and make it into a side-splitting comedy. This is an especially bittersweet movie for me as I am a big fan of Carole Lombard but I am so grateful she went on a movie such as this: a truly priceless and hilarious portrayal of Nazis. This movie is not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where Have You Gone, Jack Benny?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's too bad we don't have a Jack Benny today, a consensus national comedian, someone whom most Americans loved and understood. There's just no equivalent in 2006.Jack Benny was already a huge star on radio when TO BE OR NOT TO BE was made. He had several film roles to his credit, and had been a big star in vaudeville. A major part of the joke of TO BE OR NOT TO BE was Jack Benny's character--a vain, put-upon character, somewhat prissy and ineffectual.We see the stage from the rear, and the familiar Hamlet character walks upstage, in his velvet mantle, tights, dagger, and medallion. The camera pans around to the front, and it's Jack Benny, looking vaguely disgusted. For those of us who grew up with Jack Benny on radio or TV, that scene alone is hilarious.The film follows the Benny radio show formula--improbable boobish villains, insults, unlikely situations, mistaken identities, and, above all, a series of running gags. Some great character actors like Sig Rumann, Lionel Atwill and Felix Bressart surround Benny, as does Robert Stack and the dreamy, unusual Carole Lombard.But for those of you who didn't grow up with the cultural reference point of Jack Benny, all of this might not be enough to make it a great picture. When I first saw this as a part of William K. Everson's Friday night film series at the New School (NYC) in 1968, it was a revelation, and has remained a fond old friend to return to over the years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1939: the Nazis invade Poland. Joseph Tura (Jack Benny) and his theatrical troupe fight them. That's the bare bones--there's a lot more but see the movie to find out. A very intricate, funny script and excellent performances keep this going. Benny is funny in the lead, but Carole Lombard is letter-perfect as his wife. Also it's fun to see Robert Stack so young and handsome with gleaming white teeth as a lieutenant helping them. Some may find it hard to laugh at considering the subject matter (the film was a bomb in 1942), but it works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic war-time spoof of Nazi Germany</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"To Be or Not to Be" is one of a very small number of films that are genuine satire. Of course, satire is comedy and humor. But it can also be dramatic, action-filled, pathos, empathy and mystery or intrigue. It is most often a combination of these. The comedy is often the release or relief from what the story would be without it. The genius of comedy- satire is its ability to make audiences laugh by its treatment of a subject that most often is not otherwise very funny. Satire can cover any and all aspects of life, but the very best ? and that with unquestionably wide appeal ? is political satire. That's what we have in "To Be or Not to Be."I recall the first time I saw this movie ? how I was gripped by the humor, then by the intrigue about what came next, then by concern that Carol Lombard would be found out, and then back to the humor again. This film has considerable darting between its emotion-inducing scenes. That makes it all the more a great satire and comedy. Of course, I knew it was to be a comedy. What else could it be with Jack Benny and Carole Lombard? Still, a somewhat zany story, with great screen writing and equally great direction by Ernst Lubitsch, was able to hold sway over my viewing. Then we add superb acting all around. Carol Lombard is excellent in her role as Maria Tura. Her humorous lines are very good, but as in many other films, her "straight man" role plays perfectly with Jack Benny's Joseph Tura. His are the exaggerated blown-up lines, side glances, smirks and assorted facial expressions that ignite our uproarious laughter. Since my first viewing, I now watch this film for the pure humor and satire, and I watch for the many little subtleties that I often miss in such clever films on first viewing. And, they're not all by the main stars. The movie has several top-flight supporting actors of its day. They are the source of many of the laughs. Most are members of the Polish theater group. Felix Bressart plays Greenberg, Tom Dugan plays Bronski, Charles Halton plays Producer Dobosh, and Lionel Atwill plays Rawitch. Viewers knew for sure that the role of SS Col. Ehrhardt would not be too stern or serious ? with Sig Ruman in the role. Robert Stack is very good in his role as Polish pilot, Lt. Stanislav Sobinski, and Stanley Ridges does well in the straightest role of the film, as Professor Siletsky.This film is a must for any movie library. It may not be as funny to younger audiences who haven't yet studied the history of the World War II period. The film was made in 1941, before the U.S. entered the war. Because America was still neutral, this movie was considered too controversial so it was held back. It was finally scheduled for release in March, 1942, Then a sad event preceded its opening when Carol Lombard was killed in a plane crash in January. She was just 33 years old.One oddity I found in this film occurred in a scene after Tura (playing Siletsky) leaves Col. Erhardt's office. The camera then pans to Erhardt's appointments calendar next to his name plaque on his desk. The top of the page is dated in large letters: "1941, Tuesday, December 16." That seemed like a huge jump in time in the film ? more than two years. The movie opens on Aug. 31, 1939, the day before Germany invades Poland. Are we to think that it was more than two years later that the rest of the events transpire? The U.S. would have been at war after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, and surely there would have been some mention of that in the film. I think this was a slight oversight from the movie being filmed in late 1941 ? before Pearl Harbor. Then, when the film's release was held back because the U.S. was not yet at war, this scene wasn't re-shot. The calendar most likely should have read 1939 or 1940 in the first place. Another little oddity appears on the calendar. It is filled in with appointments at 15-minute intervals. The 10:30 slot lists Maria Tura. And, at 10:45, a single name is listed: "Schindler." Might that be a reference to Oskar Schindler, whose story is told in the 1993 blockbuster film, "Schindler's List?" If so, it would be ironic because people in 1941 (including Hollywood movie makers) would have known of Schindler only as an exploiter of Jewish labor for his wartime industrial plant in Krakow, Poland. Only after the war were Schindler's efforts made known ? how he saved the lives of hundreds of Jews. Some of the lines in this film are riotously funny. Here are a couple samples. Tura/Siletsky says, "I didn't like the way Capt. Schulz shifted the responsibility back to you." Col. Erhardt, "Neither did I. You know there's always something wrong with a man who doesn't drink, doesn't smoke, doesn't eat meat?" Tura/Siletsky, "You mean our Führer?" Erhardt, "Oh, no. Please, professor, I hope you won't ?"Before he leaves Erhardt's office, Tura (playing the fake Siletsky) asks if Erhardt had heard of that great, great Polish actor Joseph Tura. Erhardt says, "Oh, yes. As a matter of fact, I saw him on stage when I was in Warsaw once before the war." Tura/Siletsky says, rhetorically, "Really?" And Erhardt replies, "What he did to Shakespeare we are doing now to Poland."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lubitsch takes his revenge against Nazi Germany</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All that can be said about "To be or not to be" is that it was purely an aesthetic vehicle for Ernst Lubitsch to settle scores with Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Germany.Everyone knows well how many talented Jewish artists had to leave Germany when Adolf Hitler came to power. Lubitsch made Nazis bite the dust in a pacifist manner by showing them as ridiculous souls.Although the film is comic in nature there is no denial of its serious tone.There are various serious themes like World War II, relationship between a husband and a wife,behavior of actors,horrors of war which merit viewers' attention.It is true that this film suffers from a complete lack of "Lubitsch" touch but comic elements make for its absence.If you happen to be one of those viewers interested in theater especially Shakespeare and his famous plays, it would be tough for you to tolerate those people who walk out during performances based on this famous bard's plays.The hidden highlight of the film is arrogant behavior of certain actors who find it hard to believe that some people might not have heard of them. It is better to tell them that in life as in plays everything is possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A laugh is nothing to be sneezed at</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Stack as Lt. Sobinski is colorless. There is a disgusting scene at the end when the two Germans jump out of the plane, following the order of the Fuhrer. What a poor, cheap joke. And even that is topped two minutes later, when for no other reason then to get another cheap laugh, Bronski has to parachute out of the plane, so that one poor peasant can say "First Hess, now him".Having said that you can get a rough idea how brilliant this film must be when I tell you that it is easily the best film ever made! Not only best comedy, but best period. Beating in my personal list GWTW, Thief of Bagdad, Taxi Driver. Lets dive into it. First of all there is this daring concept of having a Polish theater group in the middle of the Great War outwitting their oppressors. We have a great tight story that is much more than just a vehicle to transport jokes or funny scenes. You could make a very suspenseful spy thriller out of the plot. Then there is this terrific cast, Jack Benny who needed only this one film to achieve immortality, beautiful Carol Lombard who had the task of playing the faithful wife to the great actor Joseph Tura and at the same time being just believably enough attracted to this guy who is able to drop a couple of tons of bombs. Stack of course, must be colorless, since what we do not need in this story is any serious lover's triangle. Bressart is great, Sig Ruman is just unable of being not hilariously funny and here he can give us the performance of his life. Even the tiniest role is played by an acting genius. Lional Atwill as Rawich is perhaps the one that deserves in this cast of giants a special mentioning, because the way he portrays the actor who just cannot stop overacting is alone worth watching the film half a dozen times. But most of all To be or Not to Be is funny. There are a number of running gags that have never been topped in the history of film comedy. The Schultz thing, the joke on the Hitler ending up as a cheese joke and of course the Hamlet gag. But best of all: Concentration Camp Erhardt. So far I could always resist (or I chickened out) but one of these days I will sit in row two of a Hamlet performance and I will leave at the start of the monologue. The highlight of the film is the scene when Benny/Tura is confronted with dead Professor Siletzky the guy he is just impersonating. Even after having seen this film at least 30 times it still makes me marvel how they could come up with that. My favorite scene though is right at the beginning, when Tura tells his wife that for the next play he has thought that her name should appear above his own.And she says "Oh, darling, that is so sweet of you. But of course, I do not care". He says "That is what we thought. So we won't do it". And she says "Oh". Not more. But this little scene is enough to set the mood for the entire film and it tells us all we need to know about their marriage. By the way, this scene is even funnier in the German version. Maybe it is just that I only recently had the chance of watching the Original (thanks DVD makers) but I really think the German adds something to it. Especially the off-voice at the beginning "Lubinski, Kubinski..." is more relaxed than the original and fits the mood of the film much better. And there is a great alliteration in German "Welcher widrige Wind..." I could ramble on forever. But now is the time to just sit back and enjoy the film once again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Luminous Lombard and a Never-Better Benny Light Up Lubitsch's Classic Nazi Satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a certain sense of melancholy I feel when I watch this 1942 classic Ernst Lubitsch movie, as it represents the last appearance of the luminous Carole Lombard, surely the most breathtaking and high-spirited of actresses during Hollywood's golden era. In a rush to get home to husband Clark Gable after a successful war bond tour, she died in a plane crash during the film's post-production, and as the result proves without a doubt, the world lost one of the great treasures of the silver screen. She and co-star Jack Benny play Maria and Joseph Tura, the egocentric stars of a Polish acting troupe who are caught in the 1939 Nazi invasion of Warsaw. As a world-class flirt, she is carrying on with a handsome young pilot named Stanislav Sobinski, and their trysts begin once he hears his cue to get up from his theater seat, Hamlet's famous opening line to his soliloquy as spoken by an increasingly perturbed Joseph.The romantic triangle quickly takes a backseat to an espionage thriller involving a German spy named Professor Siletsky, who holds the names of members of the Polish underground. His intention is to kill them, but the acting troupe, now with their theater in ruins, band together to stop him. This includes the need for the extremely vainglorious Joseph to impersonate Siletsky in front of the befuddled Colonel Ehrhardt and for Maria to seduce any Nazi official who stands in their way. While it sounds like a piece of wartime propaganda, the film actually becomes more farcical even as people are getting killed.As Joseph, Benny has never been better, conveying both self-absorption and cunning expertly, and the script by Edwin Justus Mayer and an uncredited Lubitsch gives him a number of great one-liners. With her honey-toned voice and smoky elegance, Lombard is at the top of her game as the seductive Maria, as she dexterously shows her comic and dramatic sides with precision and unparalleled style. Delivering her lines with subtle finesse, she provides a strong match for Benny. Sixty-four years later, and there is still no one who can touch her. The rest of the ensemble is memorable starting with Sig Ruman's hilarious turn as Ehrhardt. A fresh-faced Robert Stack, all of 22, plays Sobinski with a callow, zestful energy, while Felix Bressart excels as the ultimately heroic Greenberg.The movie makes direct commentaries on the concentration camps, and the satirical aspects are blissfully unapologetic. The stylishness of the comedy in light of the virulent wartime setting is what makes the film memorable and it proves what a master Lubitsch was at this level of subtlety. The 2005 DVD comes with two extras both featuring Benny - an ancient twenty-minute comedy short from 1930 called "The Rounder" and a brief commercial for war bonds. I wish they could have included some tribute to Lombard as it would have been fitting on this disc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent propaganda comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During and just before WWII, there were a lot of propaganda films created by Hollywood to drum up morale in our fight against Fascism. Nearly all of them were deadly serious war films. And, while many of them were great, after a while they all tended to blend together. Because of this, TO BE OR NOT TO BE is a real standout picture. The movie is a comedy and yet is every bit as effective in inspiring the war effort. Now it's not surprising that the film is so well-made as its director is Ernst Lubitsch and he is ably supported by lots of wonderful character actors such as Felix Bressart and Sig Rumand (among others). However, the nice surprise about the movie was the acting of Jack Benny in the starring role (along with the wonderful Carole Lombard). For years, Benny made fun of his acting and the movies he made, but he was great and the film was great. Aside from the rather dopey HORN BLOWS AT MIDNIGHT, in fact, I really like the few films he made.All-in-all, a fine and fun film--chock full of quality.</fullReview>

Great cast including Jack Benny, Carole Lomard, Robert Stack, Lionel Atwill and Tom Dugan among others. Jack Benny's facial expressions alone are worth watching this great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That Is The Question, Lubitsch Or Brooks?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the very few people who would think to remake an Ernst Lubitsch picture would be Mel Brooks who satirized just about every genre there was in Hollywood. But I doubt that Jack Benny, Carole Lombard and Robert Stack would have lent themselves to the slapstick type film that Brooks turned To Be Or Not To Be into and Mel's version is very funny.When the film opens the biggest problem that Jack Benny has on his mind is who's this secret admirer who keeps sending flowers to his wife Carole Lombard every night while they're on stage. Although it's helped his Hamlet performance, the angst Benny is feeling about Lombard being faithful, pretty soon Benny, Lombard, Polish airman Robert Stack and the whole touring company that Benny heads are all caught up in the Nazi German invasion of Poland which inaugurates World War II.Stack joins the Polish squadron of the RAF and there's a nice little Polish colony as with other occupied nations during World War II. One of them is Stanley Ridges who does propaganda broadcasts for the BBC. And he gets to be good pals with the airmen. But after he leaves for Germany on a 'secret' mission it's discovered in reality he's a German agent and is going back to Germany with a list of exiled Poles so that the Nazis could retaliate against families. Stack goes back to Poland after Ridges.Where he meets up with Lombard and Benny and the rest their troupe and let's just say that their talents as actors are never more needed than in the series of performances they give the occupying Germans.Whether dealing with marital problems or Nazis breathing down their necks Lombard, Benny, and Stack have no shortage of wits about them. Carole and Jack are old hands at comedy, but Bob Stack showed a nice gift for it as well. Of course Ernst Lubitsch's type of comedy is a great deal more sophisticated than Mel Brooks. He also was making his film at a time when the USA wasn't in the war yet and the outcome for Poland and the rest of the world remained in doubt. Not to mention what was left of a liberal spirit in Germany where Lubitsch was an exile from.This was Carole Lombard's farewell performance. Completed in 1941 To Be Or Not To Be was released just in time for Pearl Harbor and it certainly beats a lot of hastily made propaganda films that came out to tap into the national anger. It also got the same kind of knocks The Great Dictator did in satirizing the authoritarianism of the Nazis. But both films have stood the test of time. And it's not as preachy as The Great Dictator, but Lubitsch gets his point across. As for Lombard she went on a war bond tour which ended abruptly in a plane crash outside Las Vegas. FDR from the White House proclaimed she was as much a war casualty as any GI at the front and there were few who would disagree.If your taste runs to an earthier form of comedy Mel Brooks will certainly satisfy you. But for those who value sophistication as embodied in that phrase the Lubitsch touch, this To Be Or Not To Be still pulls in the laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Playing Hamlet in Poland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen most of Ernst Lubitsch American films, we had missed this one because it's not played often these days. "To Be, or not to Be" is a wonderful satire that only a director like Lubitsch, with his European background could have pulled. The film is a good comedy that seems to has kept some of its freshness intact.The film works because of the great contribution of Jack Benny and Carole Lombard, who sadly, died before the film had its premiere. They play the Turas, a Polish theatrical couple that foresee the Nazi invasion of their country.In fact, Jack Benny, a man associated as a comedian, first on radio, then on television, was an actor with an uncanny sense of timing. Mr. Benny was a natural for this type of comedy, as he proves in the film. His pairing with Carole Lombard was a stroke of genius. In fact, for being associated to lighter fare, he demonstrates with his take on Joseph Tura, he was an actor of stature.Carole Lombard is seen as Maria Tura, a grand dame of the Polish theater. Ms. Lombard gave a marvelous performance and her contribution to the success of this film is amazing. Robert Stack is seen as the pilot Sobinski. Other faces in the cast include Felix Bressard, Lionel Atwill, Sig Ruman, George Lynn, and others that are perfect under Ernst Lubitsch guidance.This is a film to be treasured because of the work of Jack Benny and the impeccable direction of Ernst Lubitsch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sublime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie proves that comedy can be sublime. At a time when the gods are crazy, this movie swims with the current, seeking to outdo their craziness. That's why it's also very touching. The outcome of the craziness was unknown at the time. That also makes this film daring. Whether intentionally or not, the film implies that Hitler himself was a Hitler-impersonator, that Hitler is a kind of unattainable ideal, a Platonic idea of pure evil. A similarly sublime and bold and touching film made during another craziness (not twenty years thereafter, as its more applauded cousins!) is "THE GAY DECEIVERS" (1969). It too dances with the gods, and breaks your heart as it makes you laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Witty and mocking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joseph Tura and his wife are part of an actors troop in pre-WW2 Poland. When a handsome young pilot is forced to break off his affair with Mrs Tura to go to England and join the RAF, he sends a message through an English agent who offers to take messages to families of all the pilots when he goes to Poland. Realising too late that Professor Siletsky is a double agent taking addresses to the Nazi's, Lt Sobinski alerts Tura who is forced to play several roles to try and outwit the Nazi's and protect the underground resistance.Despite having heard it mentioned (and avoided the remake) I had still never seen this film until earlier today. I wasn't sure what to expect as I knew that it had been made during the war and that it's humour might not seem as mocking or sharp today. However I was surprised how funny it actually was while it also dealt with the Nazi issue at the same time. The mocking tone of the film is balanced nicely by a real vein of wit with sharp word play all around. The plot is kept ticking over by this humour until Tura is able to drive the film by his many performances!The Nazi's are mocked without taking away from the horrors of what they were. The cast are what really makes the film work for me though. Although he takes second billing, I can't help but feel that Benny is the star of the film as he has all the best characters and the lion's share of the lines. Lombard does very well indeed and shows a real ability for quick witty lines ? the fact that she died in a plane crash leaving this her last movie should be considered a great loss. The whole support cast, whether Polish actor or German commander, all play very well managing to bring both wit and pathos to the film.Overall a film that is not as uncomfortable to watch as I suspected it might have been, in fact one that is downright hilarious at times and has all the sharpness and wit that I want in a comedy. When Jack Benny says `so they call me Concentration Camp Ehrhardt' for the 5th time, I defy you not to be rolling!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Satirical Comedy That Gets Even Better As It Goes Along</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beneath all the one-liners and amusing gags, this classic comedy has an undertone of satire that is quite effective. Jack Benny plays his role with just the right amount of exaggeration for it to work perfectly, and he, Carole Lombard, and the rest of the cast help Ernst Lubitsch to tell a lively yet worthwhile tale. There are a few slow spots early in the movie, but after it hits its stride, everything fits together well.Very few film-makers can make something like this succeed, because they take themselves too seriously. Lubitsch does not, and as a result this film provides a caricatured but relatively insightful portrayal of the Nazis, with a light-hearted yet appreciative look at those who opposed them in the occupied countries. The right kind of lighter touch can sometimes be more effective in commenting on important issues than the heavy, emotionally laden harangues that are all too common.While providing good entertainment, this movie also brings out the Nazis' inherent insecurity, pettiness, and short-sightedness, while also demonstrating their growing capacity for destroying the innocent. For example, the wonderful character actor Sig Ruman is greatly entertaining as a Nazi bureaucrat, yet he also cleverly brings out the pathetic side of such persons.Aside from a couple of good gags, it starts off just a little slowly. A lot of time is spent on Robert Stack's character, who is (through no fault of Stack's) not very interesting. Likewise, the subplot involving him and Lombard takes up a lot more time than it was worth. Other than that, though, it moves briskly, with many entertaining scenes while it develops the story. As the pace picks up, the members of Benny's acting troupe get some fine moments of their own, Benny himself has some fine scenes with several other characters, and everything builds up nicely towards a good finale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gem of a picture!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This comedy excels due to witty dialog and superior direction. Set against the backdrop of Hitler's invasion of Poland, due acknowledgment is made of the tragedy of that event. This was a wartime picture, after all. But the satire serves as a perfect antidote, and "To Be or Not To Be" is simultaneously funny and sharp. Right after I watched this movie, I wanted to watch it again--it was that entertaining. The stars and character actors were all superb. Having Jack Benny play the lead was an inspired casting choice. Felix Bressart and Tom Dugan as Greenberg and Bronski, sort of the Rosencranz and Gildenstern of this movie, are hilarious. If you have not yet seen this movie, rent or buy it and treat yourself to a real gem!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Husband and wife Carole Lombard (Maria) and Jack Benny (Joseph) are the leading lights in a Polish Theatre Company during the outbreak of World War 2. They are currently performing "Hamlet" and soldier Robert Stack (Sobinski), who is obsessed with Lombard and attends all her performances, is there in the audience on every occasion. Lombard and Stack arrange meetings with a pre-determined code. When Benny gives his "To be or Not to Be" soliloquy, that is Stack's cue to get up and leave and go backstage, much to Benny's outrage at someone getting up and leaving during his finest moment! When traitor Stanley Ridges (Professor Siletsky) passes through Poland on his way to deliver a list of names of Polish Resistance members to Hitler, the actors jump into action to prevent him reaching Germany with the list. Can they get away with their daring charades? This film is funnier than I expected and had me laughing out loud on a few occasions. Jack Benny is excellent in the lead role and the whole cast are on form. There are loads of humorous scenes and the film has a great ending to round things off. It's a shame that they cut Carole Lombard's line about what could possibly happen in a plane from the film. This would have given extra poignancy to the film given that she died in a plane crash after making this film. I think the line should have remained in there.Basically, a gang of actors come good and defeat the Nazis through various deceptions. It's lightweight entertainment that really does entertain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A double bill review with Mel Brooks' remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An enthralling and ebullient double bill of two versions of TO BE OR NOT TO BE, Lubitsch's Black &amp; White masterpiece, also famous for being Carole Lombard's swan song before a plane crash brought her away from this world at the prime age of 33, and Mel Brooks' (almost) faithful color remade (although the director title falls on the head of his longtime collaborator Alan Johnson) starring him and his wife Ms. Bancroft. It is the same story being transcribed under two different palettes, the remake owes its tongue-in-cheek drollness greatly to the screenwriter Edwin Justus Mayer of the 1942 version since many one-liners are copied verbatim, both versions are abounding with witty caricatures of Hitler and his Nazi regime, embellishes a tall order in the wartime Warsaw with conspicuous burlesque, a Polish acting troupe's collective endeavour to hunt down a German spy and a subsequent flee from war zone to England, during which a crucial tool is that our hero, the ham actor Joseph Tura (Benny) / Frederick Bronski (Brooks), has to playact different characters, from the spy professor, a Nazi colonel and even Hitler himself (in the remake), to bluff his way out; meanwhile he is also vexed by the budding romance between his actor wife Maria (Lombard) / Anna (Bancroft) and a young aviator Lt. Sobieski (Stack) / Lt. Sobinski (Matheson). But there are also apparent differences which can bear out why Lubitsch's original is a much better piece of work, taking the opening sequences for example, Lubitsch starts with a voice-over narrating an unusual happening in Warsaw before WWII, Adolf Hitler is spotted on the street, then a following revelation reveals that it is after all an act, Hitler is played by a character actor who tries to test his resemblance by walking among the mass, what a pleasant surprise! But in the remake, Mel Brooks doesn't adopt this route, instead, he opens with a vaudeville number SWEET GEORGIA BROWN with Bancroft, a fairly impressive stunt but fails to match Lubitsch's ingenious gambit, later audience will discover, one main reason behind this alteration is that there is no role of the character actor who resembles Hitler in this version, as Brooks himself will disguise as Hitler in the final escape scam, so probably it is a sacrifice to fulfil Brooks' own ego to enlarge his part as the star.For most part, the silver-screen magnetism of the original is beguilingly outstrips the remake's more mundane touch, and being a well-intended fairytale, the mundane touch is unfortunately an impediment particularly in the elongated escape plan, the entire operation feels preposterous with the all the chase (don't let me start on the doggie Mutki's eleventh- hour jump) and what happens to the real Hitler in the theatre, he doesn't feel absurd when clearly no actors are on the stage to perform? In the original, this passage is fast-paced with a whimsical take of the fake Hitler ordering two pilots to jump off the plane without parachutes, to mock Nazi's blind obedience.With all my respect to Brooks and Bancroft, but in the remake, they are just too old for their roles, egregiously jarring is Brooks as young Hamlet in his ridicule titular monologue, seriously? I don't consider myself as an ageist, but this is more than a farce to swallow. Bancroft is two-and-a-half decades past her prime as a seductress in THE GRADUATE (1967, 8/10), her comedic bent can never pass beyond the slinky postures. OK. we get it, it is a family business, let the profit kept within one's own turf. However, a big thumb-up for the remake to introduce an openly gay character Sasha (Haake), Anna's dresser, into the plot, in order to carry through the side-splitting wisecrack "how can a theatre survive without Jews, gays and gypsies?". Also Charles Durning usurps an Oscar-nomination for the remake as Col. Erhardt, but having watched the original first, his farcical rendition feels a shade forced compared with Sig Ruman's effortless spontaneity.In the original, the Lombard-and-Benny pair forms a more organic liaison thanks a lot to the retro flair, she is a classic lady with glamour and dignity, he is somewhat childlike but self- consciously over-proud of his acting, their bickering is crammed with spark and tease, even Robert Stack's handsome pilot is dreamier in the vintage silhouette. All in all, it might be unfair for the remake to be viewed immediately after the original, but also the double-bill viewing is a telling corroboration of why vintage classics can obtain their timeless appeal, nostalgia aside, they are absolutely one-of-a-kind in their visual tactility, their characters' mannerism and the streamlined narrative tactics, if you are into it, you cannot get enough of it, as for the remake, maybe it is just not vintage enough, nothing we can do about that, as least for now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't familiar with Jack Benny going into this movie, other than his rep that said he couldn't cross over into film. I don't really see why, I thought he was quite capable and had a command of guises and disguises that weren't dissimilar from someone like Sacha Guitry. There can also be a connection made to Preston Sturges, with all the madcappery going on that still feels just as vital today. Some of the jokes could very well be inserted into an episode of The Simpsons and viewers wouldn't bat an eyelash. I loved seeing Robert Stack show up as a dippy flingy paramour. I think what impresses me most with To Be Or Not To Be is the sense of play throughout, and not just onstage. There are matters of love, life and death that are treated most often as debonair or romantic whimsy. A farce about humanity's greatest threat. IN YOUR FACE, Hitler</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***User reviewer theowinthrop ("Swan Song in Warsaw", theowinthrop from United States, 12 November 2005) has an interesting review that covers most of the bases which follow here.*** "To Be Or Not To Be (1942, Ernst Lubitsch)", a comedy about the Nazi invasion of Poland, is worthwhile escapism. It is a product of the time it was made. Completed in 1941, the producers withheld it from release until the US was at war with Germany. When it was being made, the US was still neutral regarding the conflicts raging in Europe. So the Nazi subject matter (e.g., many digs at Adolf Hitler, the references to concentration camps, the Gestapo, etc.), was fairly new to Western audiences. There is a strong propaganda element throughout, and the leading actors are handicapped by the need to kiss up to the Allies while demonizing the Axis powers.This film may have inspired "Hogan's Heroes" which arrives 25 years later. For both, the Germans are easily defeated. "Hogan's Heroes" also has a Colonel Schultz who is particularly dim-witted.Even though the Saturday crowd was laughing out loud, many of the gags seem pretty antiquated today. What makes "To Be Or Not to Be" enjoyable is the performance by the three principal leads. Also, the Edwin Justic screenplay is energetic.In the tradition of 1930s screwball comedies, Robert Stack as Lieutenant Stanislav Sobinski is a very handsome young man in pursuit of love but inexperienced at it. He is more than a capable bombardier and soldier, but love is a more difficult battle altogether.Jack Benny's Joseph Tura, a pompous actor obsessed with his wife's presumed infidelities, is quite brilliant. Even though Tura repeats himself frequently, Benny has the skill to keep it interesting. Benny might have become a clown to rival Bob Hope if he had made more films. However, for many reasons Carole Lombard (as Maria Tura) is obviously the main attraction here.Lombard did not live to see this film released. She was killed at age 33 while flying to a war bond rally. Her departure was a terrible loss for world cinema. Not only is Carole Lombard breathtakingly beautiful, she is vastly talented. She excelled in comedic repartee. Her Maria Tura thinks very fast on her feet while captivating throughout. Carole Lombard was an elite performer during the fabled Golden Era of Hollywood.Cinephiles will enjoy "To Be or Not to Be." Just don't board an aircraft with an unpressurized cabin getting to the revival theater showing this.</fullReview>

Never Relying on Slapstick, it is All Done with Wit and Timing, Along with a Complicated Narrative Intertwining a Theatre Troupe Dressing Up and Posing as Nazi's with Real Nazi's.

It was Mostly Ignored or Shunned and if it was Talked About at All it was Generally Agreed it was in Bad Taste.But it is a Well Pieced Together Plot Wavering Between Intrigue and Scripted One-Liners that Pepper the Picture and is the Glue that Holds it Together. Not All of the Jokes Work, but that is Typical of Most Comedies...Hitler as Cheese...for Example. But when they do they are Terrific...Robert Stack Bragging about His Manhood..."I can drop two tons of dynamite in two seconds".Overall, Jack Benny is Surprisingly Good and Carole Lombard is Masterful with Perfect Timing and a See Through Dress.

Stanislav Sobinski (Robert Stack). After the German invasion, Sobinski is in England. He meets Professor Siletsky who is going back to Poland. Everybody gives him family and friends names to send greetings to. Sobinski is suspicious when he doesn't know who Maria Tura is. Before Sobinski could tell the higher ups, he's gone back and Sobinski is sent after him.This is a suspenseful thriller with some jokes thrown in. The remake is funnier and jokier. This one still has the funniest line "Heil myself". Mel Brooks makes walking out on "To be or not to be" much funnier than Jack Benny. Jack is less outrageous than Mel. This one is just more of a spy action movie being shown right in the middle of the war. It does struggle with the tone as it keeps going back to the big laughs with Jack Benny. It's a battle between the dark serious subject matter and Jack Benny trying to ham it up.</fullReview>

Funny comedy has a fantastic opening("Heil Myself"!) and premise. Good acting, directing, and script, even if this is fundamentally absurd!

		<fullReview>It is hard to believe now that Comedy great Jack Benny's most magical movie role would be mostly in a Nazi uniform. No one knew when it was made that it would be the last of the great legacy of Carol Lombard. Clark Gable was often described as being heart broken from the time of the tragedy on though he kept making movies.Historically, this film was not well received in 1942 and Benny's best role was in the direct path after Chaplin has paved the way here in The Great Dictator. This Ernest Lubitch production goes beyond that. This is the film which inspired a lot of the Nazi comedy films that were made way after the war.When you hear Jack Benny say the name "Schultz" here, you can't help but think that this movie inspired the creators of Stalag 17 &amp; Hogan's Hero's which both had a Schultz. When you see Mel Brooks "The Producer's" and other works where he does Nazi comedy, you can't help but feel the relationship &amp; perhaps inspiration this movie gave to Brooks when he saw it.When I see Lombard and how great she looks in this movie, I can almost feel the tragedy that Gable must have felt. What a terrible fate that she a wonderful woman was cut down before her time. In some of the scenes in this, she looks every bit as beautiful as Marilyn Monroe the other tragic blonde who came later.This is a very good movie which did not sell tickets because of it's release date. It is very worthwhile to see this &amp; in a pair with Chaplin's "The Great Dictator", should be used in History classes addressing World War 2 as both films are amazing work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing is Better Than Nazi Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The comedy To Be or Not to Be is directed by Ernst Lubitsch and stars Carole Lombard and Jack Benny. The film takes place between 1939 and 1941 in Poland.The film starts off with a man believed to be Adolf Hitler standing in the middle of the streets of 1939 Warsaw. It is then discovered that he is only in a play and proving a point to the director that he does look like Hitler when the director said that the man does not. Maria and Joseph Tura (Lombard and Benny) are both actors for a theatre. Maria has a secret admirer in the audience who always comes to see her when her husband reads the line "to be or not to be" and Joseph gets extremely offended by this. Then the war has started between Poland and Germany and the Turas have a part in helping their country...The screenplay for this film is one of the strongest aspects of the film. It has many classic one liners and is one of the best satires of the time period. The plot stays interesting the whole way through and the characters are all likable even though most of them do not have any depth. One of my favorite parts of the film is any scene with the Nazi Colonel in it who always blames his Captain for the mistakes he made.Lubitsch's direction for this film was mediocre. It was very straight forward direction, there was no risks in the shots he took, no complexity, just him deciding to put his camera right in front of the action. Lubitsch was able to get solid performances out of his whole cast, so that is a plus one for him as a director. I thought the film was lacking in the reaction shot close up department because that only makes a funny line funnier when I see the reaction another character has to it.Along with the direction the editing was very plain and simple. There were a lot of fade to blacks which made it seem like it was a play and that a scene had just finished. The shots were all very long, there was never any editing for any stylistic use. Now I know what many of you readers are saying now, it's 1942 not the 90s where every movie has stylistic editing. Well I agree with you but it is nice to sometimes see some variation.The acting for the film was another strong aspect. Lombard was excellent as Maria Tura. She acted like an actress and did so brilliantly and delivered her many witty lines just as brilliantly. Benny was fantastic as the great Polish actor Joseph Tura. Every line he said he delivered with such force that the comedy was great since he had the majority of the jokes. The rest of the supporting cast were all equally wonderful and had many memorable moments.The score for this film was exactly what it needed to be to add another layer to the humor. Deservingly so it was nominated for an Oscar. With all the slapstick humor in this film a good score is needed or else nothing will really be that funny and this score delivers the laughs.Overall I give this film a 7/10. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys classic comedies, especially satires. This one is much different than the comedies from today, and that's a good thing.</fullReview>

The movie is witty and manages to make light of very serious matters.Carole Lombard is breathtakingly beautiful and great in her final role.

		<fullReview>This is one fine and also rather effective WW II comedy, that mocks the Nazi's and their direct leaders.The movie got actually made during WW II and therefore this movie, just like Chaplin's "The Great Dictator" can be seen as a relevant one for its time and propaganda for the good cause. Lots of the cast and crew involved with this movie 'fought' for the good cause during WW II and supported the troops abroad and rallied for cash bonds. For instance also Carole Lombard, who got killed before this movie got released, when the plane with her aboard crashed, when she returned from a tour selling war bonds.It's a movie that hits the mark with its comedy and spoofing elements, without ever getting a tiresome or overdone movie with its comedy and anti-Nazi themes. It's a more subtle done movie, thanks to its very fine written script.To me it really was the movie its script that pushed to movie to great heights. It's a movie that is always going and never stops for anything. It constantly puts its characters in some odd and also often dangerous situations. Just when you think its over they are rolling right into another- even bigger problem, which of course also is all the more hilarious as well. Because of this the movie basically gets better by the minute. It already all begins really well but it ends even better. You'll laugh more and more as the movie heads toward its ending.It also has a real original concept of a group of Polish actors fighting the Nazi invaders with the help of their acting abilities. So its Hamlet against Hitler in this movie! It makes this an original and really pleasant movie to watch. Even though it of course is about serious subjects, especially considering that the movie got made during WW II itself and has some deeper political meanings to it, it never becomes a heavy movie to watch. It's like laughing at WW II during WW II itself. It shows that the world was not entirely dark and sober during WW II. Somewhere people were still laughing and that's always a great remedy in dark, hard and uncertain times.Because the movie is so well written, also the movie its comedy mostly comes directly from its situations and dialog. One thing that often is great about '40's and also '30's comedies is its written dialog. It provides the movie with plenty of laughs and makes you wonder why writers like this are not involved with comedy-writing now days. Probably because the genre has got less prestige now days, when compared to the '40's especially, when basically each year a movie like this got nominated for plenty of Oscar's. Strangely enough this movie received only one nomination though, for its music. Perhaps this was due to the movie its bad release date, not too long after Pearl Harbor and of course also Carole Lombard's early death.The movie has a solid '40's cast with talented actors such as Carole Lombard, Jack Benny, Robert Stack and Lionel Atwill involved. Basically everyone got well cast and each and everyone of them portrays some great and likable simple comedy characters.Heil Hamlet!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is, for now, the only Lubitsch film I liked so much ! ! ! I hadn't heard of Jack Benny but he is great as a "ham" actor playing multiple roles.Carole Lombard's role of the wife with various male suitors suits her...The rest of the cast is somewhat forgotten except for the pilot, Maria's lover (?) whom I didn't like...Yet the supporting characters are as entertaining as the leads...I don't usually like Lubitsch so much but this is a swell comedy with Shakespeare references, a lot of fun in the theater and it makes fun of the Nazis adding a touch of melancholy for Poland's sake, what more can you want???</fullReview>

The valiant marriage utilize their talents of stage interpretation to save Warsaw fighters against the invading Nazis. Meanwhile, during the representation of playwright 'Hamlet'by William Shakespeare, a spectator, the lieutenant Stanislaw(Robert Stack), gets up his seat and goes to dressing room of the star...Unforgettable characters, lots of laughs, one of the best films of the cinema history and the best of Lubitsch, a real cinema classic. Sensational Jack Benny and sophisticated Carole Lombard who wears lush gowns, this is her last appearance, but shortly after she was deceased in a plane crash. Phenomenal secondary cast such as Stanley Ridges as professor Siletsky and special mention to Sig Ruman as inefficient 'Concentration camp'Colonel Ehrhardt.Only was nominated to musical score for Miklos Rozsa, though deserved several Oscars but did not win prizes. The motion picture is magnificently directed by Ernest Lubitsch with his usual 'touch'. At the time movie, during the 40s, this one failed and obtained lukewarm reception by public and reviewers and Lubitsch was framed to deal slightly a serious issue, the Nazi invasion of Poland. Although in 1966, fortunately, the Congress of United States included justly in the 'National Film Registry', considering an American cultural treasure.Of course, in Germany and another countries of German influence was prohibited, and in Spain retarded thirty years its exhibition. The film was remade in an inferior musical version by Alan Johnson(1983)with marriage in real life, Mel Brooks(role of Jack Benny)-Anne Bancroft(Carole Lombard) and Charles Durning (Col.Ehrhardt).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very dark and somewhat non-comical comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By no means is this movie not funny at all, but it is by all accounts perhaps the most serious movie Ernst Lubitsch ever made. Taking place in Poland during the "Blitzkreig" of 1939 that jump-started World War II, there is much more satire than screwball in this story, and I have to admit I didn't laugh nearly as much as in Ninotchka or even Trouble in Paradise. Of course, it could be possible Lubitsch wasn't going for the witty laughs. Rather, it seems he was trying to make a serious film about a serious time all the while poking fun at the enemy at the same time.The cast is very good with the beautiful Carole Lombard leading the way in her final role before tragically dying in a plane crash. Jack Benny is rather obnoxious in his role as a hapless Shakespearean actor married to Lombard, but doesn't realize she is having an affair with a soldier he needs to help defeat the Nazis. The story takes many turns that are far too unbelievable especially in scenes about the Nazis and the ending. Still, for fans of Lubitsch, it is possible to see his beautiful touch on this story even if it is murky with so much war dribble.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What he did to Shakespeare, we are doing now to Poland"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With my supply of Billy Wilder pictures rapidly dwindling, I decided to turn my attention to the filmmaker who is generally agreed to have been the writer/director's foremost inspiration. Born in Berlin in 1892, Ernst Lubitsch began his film career as an actor in 1912, and writing and directing duties followed just two years later. He swiftly made a name for himself in German cinema, and, recognising the greater resources to be found in Hollywood, relocated to the United States in 1922, under contract with Mary Pickford. Talented writer Billy Wilder ? also born in Germany ? worked with Lubitsch on two pictures, 'Bluebeard's Eighth Wife (1938)' and 'Ninotchka (1939),' and the influence to be found in Wilder's later work is unmistakable. 'Stalag 17 (1953)' was a courageous comedy picture in its own right, approaching Nazicism and prisoners-of-war in a lighthearted fashion, but Lubitsch's 'To Have and Have Not (1942),' released at the height of World War Two, is in a completely different league of audaciousness. War-time propaganda has never been so much fun!The picture opens with a peaceful street in Warsaw, where citizens are leisurely going about their business. Suddenly, everybody turns in shock, staring in disbelief at the person who has just sidled up to Mr. Maslowski's delicatessen ? could that possibly be Adolf Hitler? It turns out that he is merely an actor engaged in a local theatre production, where famous performers Joseph and Maria Tura (Jack Benny and Carole Lombard) are staging a Nazi satire. On the eve of opening night, political forces prevent the play from being performed, but those sets and costumes certainly aren't going to go to waste. After Hitler's army marches into Poland without warning, throwing Warsaw into disarray, it falls to these actors to prevent the leakage of top-secret Allied documents to the Gestapo. To avoid execution, Joseph Tura must deliver the acting performance of his career, all the while keeping an eye on his wife, whom he suspects of being unfaithful with a handsome Polish pilot (Robert Stack).The early years of the 1940s provided a unique assortment of Hollywood pictures, with war-time propaganda reaching its manipulative, patriotic climax. Most filmmakers responded to the current political climate with super-serious and often unconvincing drama, but a select few ? including Charles Chaplin with 'The Great Dictator (1940)' ? decided to unveil the comedic side of war, often layered beneath the tragedy of conflict and persecution. 'To Be or Not to Be' spends a few too many minutes on Robert Stack's comparatively uninteresting Allied spy, but, as soon as Jack Benny re-enters the equation, the farce kicks into full-gear. German-born Sig Ruman is hilarious as the bumbling Col. "Concentration Camp" Ehrhardt, and Billy Wilder obviously thought so highly of the performance that he cast the actor as the very-similar Sgt. Johann Schulz in 'Stalag 17.' We always enjoy seeing our film heroes cleverly out-wit the foolish bad-guys, and when the bad-guys are none other than Adolf Hitler and his band of Nazis, victory is very sweet, indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lubitsch comedy masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just the thought of Jack Benny walking onto a stage as Hamlet is enough to send anyone into spasms of laughter. That he does - and a lot more -in "To Be or Not to Be," a 1942 film about the Lunt and Fontanne (Benny and Carole Lombard) of Poland, Josef and Maria Tura, as they go up against the Nazis. Circumstances make it necessary for the acting troupe to pose as Nazi guards and officers and for Maria to pretend to romance one of Hitler's main men in order to head off a Nazi spy (Stanley Ridges).This film is absolutely hilarious, with several running bits, including Maria telling a young soldier (Robert Stack) that he can visit her dressing room when Josef starts his big speech. When Josef says, "To be or not to be," the soldier stands up and leaves the theater, making Josef believe the man is simply walking out on his performance. This goes on throughout the film. Robert Stack is so young he's virtually unrecognizable.The supporting cast is excellent, doubling beautifully as actors - one of whom longs to play Shylock (Felix Bressart) but carries a sword instead and one who wants a chance to play Hitler (Tom Dugan) - and as Nazis. Sig Ruman plays the buffoonish Col. Ehrhardt.However funny "To Be or Not to Be" is, and it's wonderfully funny, Lubitsch manages to make his point that war is scary and tragic when the audience is shown the Warsaw stores closed and the streets nothing but rubble. There was nothing remotely amusing about the Nazi occupation of Poland, but 1942 audiences, while being reminded of this, were allowed to laugh and forget their troubles for a little while. The laughter doesn't last long, especially since Carole Lombard died in a plane crash so shortly after the film's release. That marred the legacy of "To Be or Not to Be," but today, we should see it for the classic that it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"To Be or Not to Be" is about a troupe of Polish actors who become entangled in a plot involving a Nazi spy during the German occupation of Poland. The film's title is a reference to the fact that the troupe frequently performs "Hamlet".The egocentric ham actor and leader of the troupe, Joseph Tura, is played by that great, great comedic actor, Jack Benny. Benny plays is oft-played role of a man who overrates his own abilities with relish. Carole Lombard is also excellent as Joseph's smooth wife Maria and the rest of the cast is solid.This film features sharp humor that parodies the Nazis and criticizes them. The film is funny all-around, but especially so during the second half. My favorite scene is the one where Joseph Tura is told improvise in order to keep a professor working for the Nazis in his office, but he can't improvise effectively despite being an actor. The way Benny botches the improvisation by repeating the "Concentration Camp" Ehrhardt line and following it with strained laughter is perfect. "To Be or Not to Be" is another excellent comedy film from director Ernst Lubitsch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Any partner resembles him</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"To be or not to be" (1942) directed by Ernst Lubitsch is like answer to the question, without knowing that some of the characters were talking about a play concerning an invader, but coming soon maybe will watching it. What means the touch of Lubitsch ? An invisible taste for the crazy happening not programmed by the screenplay, even not necessarily as an improvisation, but much more as a kind of refraction among the characters in a given scene of clarification, where every behavior is mainly at high expression by its reflection on the others as mannequins manipulated in a true scene of life, before the unthinkable of the gestures and compasses as dramatic rule of the comedy. While non sense switch slowly or quickly as harlequins of posterity in a new sense of a given detail, as the kitsch itself of retroactive modernity from the personality at the better of the story. Normally it arrives just when two thirds of the duration occurred and something improvable and improbable of new happens and pick out.Warsaw before the war, not at all but just in time to play the comedy on stage, whilst meanwhile the audience of foreign viewers would be from those whom the players are acting, either with their uniforms. As though liking seemingly of the same Hitler's clothes, perhaps or even any partner resembles him but from the other opposite side truly. And it happens... It is supposed to be a great movie in black and white, a comedy about national socialism and its specific fairly way of exposure of uniforms and songs as opera given by aristocrats feelings to the insignificant people of the corner of the next small street with commerce stores, as if it was possible being assimilated with them without any single purpose of the racial division between superior and inferior status forgotten at the time with its tricky conception of unemployed under class. The style of the director Lubitsch was having his so-called touch of history, with the invasion of Poland to the go in 1939, like the play performed by this story of Jewish theater. Or, doing it for having this qualification, as composed by migrant workers, like fake actors playing the invader without knowing that it arrives for just the premiere of the play. And perhaps their inclusion in a concentration camp nearby, if they don't take some measures of desecration before the oppressor as one of them said subtly in one ambiguous line. This movie it was a fairly tale out of any reality show, because sound predominates over sights. It was a demonstration by absurd. It seems as a gloss over -one year after Hess was escaping by plane from Germany to England for convincing the authorities there of both countries to make a deal for a conditioned war -, limiting the foolish way that turned in between. Lubitsch as director was maybe sensible to this involuntary comic boundary of such a tragedy when America was still hesitating for participation in the war at Europe, misgiving about any overview from there about the gravity of the ferocity against Eastern peoples and slave labor on concentration camps and the lack of hygiene on ghettos.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Be Treasured and Not To Be Missed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A gem in so many ways that should not be missed. And please don't accept later remakes. There is a subtlety here with the people who are going through the actual events in real life playing at the same time the events are going on, with a Jewish man in the lead role. There is an edge to the humor against Hitler and the Nazis (interestingly, pronounced "NAH-zees" by the narrator, Lombard and others in the film, rather than "NOT-zees" as we pronounce it today). None of this can be reproduced.Not enough credit is given to Jack Benny for his leading man looks, so often overlooked because he started in radio, starred in very few films, and was an old man by the time he got into television where most folks could see him. But he could hold his own as a leading man in looks (unlike most comics, especially of that day). I'm guessing the reason whomever reviewed the movie for television gave it only 3 rather than 4 stars might be because Benny might not be totally convincing in the Hamlet, serious pieces. But that is more a flaw in the eyes of the viewer (we keep seeing a replaying of the comic in our eyes rather than the actor). Maybe it was preachy when the lines of Shakespeare's Shylock are repeatedly delivered, an ironic plea of the Jewish people's humanity against the inhumanity of those who still seek to harm them, in Shakespeare's day, in Hitler's day, and in ours. But Benny's performance is strong enough, his conviction real enough, and the truth of those words of Shakespeare virile enough to still live and reach hearts today.I gave this a 9-out-of-10 only for a sentimental reason...the ending. It's funny, and you'll enjoy it I'm sure. Maybe it is the perfect ending. But for a sentimental old Italian like myself, it was a little bittersweet. I'm sentimental enough to have wanted a happier and less ironic ending, that's all.Other than that, it is a gem that you can't miss. You won't be disappointed. And speaking of Jack Benny...run, don't walk...okay, you can't do either of those, but go to the Internet Archive Old Time Radio page (the free one, not the one that charges you for public domain files) and listen to every Jack Benny radio show. You won't be sorry. And you'll enjoy his movies all the more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's August 1939 in Warsaw, Poland. A theatre group led by popular stage actress Carole Lombard (as Maria Tura) and her hammy husband Jack Benny (as Joseph Tura) rehearse their funny Nazi play "Gestapo" ? eventually, they're ordered to cancel the comedy due to the risk of offending Adolph Hitler, the German dictator then invading countries and disposing of their Jewish citizens in concentration camps. However, they are allowed to continue performing Shakespeare's "Hamlet". During the performance, Ms. Lombard agrees to meet handsome young fan Robert Stack (as Stanislav Sobinski), when Mr. Benny begins his soliloquy "To Be or Not to Be?" A bomber for the RAF, Mr. Stack fancies himself in love with Lombard. She enjoys the attention, but warns Stack she is a married woman. When Hitler invades Poland, Stack returns to Britain. There, he discovers a plot to exterminate the Warsaw resistance. Stack parachutes to Poland and involves Lombard, Benny and their theatre company in an effort stop the Nazis...Deftly directed by Ernst Lubitsch, "To Be or Not to Be" was unusual in that it treated the Nazis in a farcical manner. Funny Nazis during World War II did not amuse everyone. Echoing this film's repeated "Heil Hitler!" salute, the popular TV series "Hogan's Heroes" was criticized for finding humor in the subject ? three decades later. Also a downer, Lombard tragically died in a plane crash before this, her last film, was released. Her performance is marvelous. Standout co-star Benny and everyone involved can count "To Be or Not to Be" as a career peak. In 1983, the film received a high profile re-male by Mel Brooks' company. While not superior to this version, Mr. Brooks' film was quite enjoyable. It did correct a minor flaw in this version ? plot transitions aren't always smooth. For example, Stack appears in Lombard's bed after a long run around Warsaw; without a clue about what is happening, we see her take over his mission. By all means, see both versions ? but start with this one. Laughter is still the best medicine.********* To Be or Not to Be (2/15/42) Ernst Lubitsch ~ Carole Lombard, Jack Benny, Robert Stack, Sig Ruman</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the dark and light of the Nazis and theater, with Carol Lombard!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Be or Not to Be is a film that carries the real horror and dread of Europe facing the threats and devastation of Hitler and the Nazis, and never forgets that, but is also a light, screwball comedy about the art of performance and the enjoyment we all get knowing someone is getting something over on another guy. Lubtisch's filmmaking and comic timing moves like a precise slab of butter (if that's a weird analogy), smooth and on point all the time.It follows a Polish theater company that see a the Germans invading, bombing their town, and the two stars of the company played by Jack Benny and Carole Lumbard, embroiled in a plot with a Nazi-leaning professor and even going up to Hitler himself. Nevermind they don't have Polish (or even most German) accents, they don't bother pretending on that front ironically considering the trickery on hand. This is meant to be a piece of world war two theatricality that can and does endure because it deals with showmanship, actor ego (from Benny with his Hamlet to the side characters trying to get Shylock just right) and playing a character as it's main focus (if there's any modern film that owes It's debt to Lubitsch and how people put on ruses in such high stakes it's Inglouious Basterds, down to a climax in a theater full of Nazis).And as funny as Jack Benny is, especially when his character reacts to that dear of a bomber pilot who has the hots for Carole Lombard, I think Lombard really makes this even better than expected. She's exquisite, ferocious, precocious, sexy, and yet terribly serious about her craft and the people she loves, plus the theater itself. You see just charm and grace radiating off her, and yet she completely gets how to make Mary always reacting and figuring things out. Benny is the big wonderful goof of the movie, while Lombard is the star.Its sublime entertainment and I only regret not seeing it sooner; Mel Brooks made a remake in the 80s which is good but nowhere near the impact of this picture. Just the scene with the Germans marching into town and Lubitsch's cut aways to the citizens looking on in shocked-but-passive disbelief makes it a must see alone.</fullReview>

And yet, as many an actor has said, the only thing harder to do than great tragedy is great comedy.And the only thing harder than that is a convincing mixture of both.And that is what this movie is.There are a lot of Lubitsch comedies that I can watch over and over, especially those he did with Jeannette MacDonald and Maurice Chevalier. It mixes the most serious tragedy with the cleverest comedy, taking you from one to the other flawlessly.There is nothing funny about Felix Bressart's delivery of Shylock's speech; his character has every reason to believe he may be killed by the gestapo. It is deeply moving.Yet there is nothing funnier than when a young man walks out on Joseph Tura's/Jack Benny's "To be or not to be" soliloquy.I've seen this movie several times.

		<shortDescription>A True Classic in Every Respect. Yes, Jack Benny Can Act!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I ran into this little film on TCM and spent a good hour finding a reasonably-priced copy on the Internet (WB-2005 slightly used). The Mel Brooks 1983 remake is not as good as the Lubitch 1942 original. A poor Jewish thespian troupe in Poland struggles to continue it's meager livelihood by producing plays, but The Nazis take over Poland and blow up the entire neighborhood. A brilliant mixture of comedy, satire, and melodrama which includes a love triangle between "ham" actor Josef Tura (Jack Benny) his actress wife Maria Tura (Carole Lombard) and a Polish RAF flier (Robert Stack). The classic line: "Tura is doing on stage what Hitler is doing to Poland". Throw in a fanatically-crazy Nazi spy, stupid, bumbling Germans and a bit of cloak-and-dagger action and you have quite a unique production. Probably the inspiration for "Hogan's Heroes" decades later. While the real Hitler is waiting for the play to begin, the fake Hitler causes a riot, and the entire madcap cast hijacks the "Fuhrer's" car and airplane and escapes to Scotland. It's both a screwball comedy and a serious comment on the Nazi menace, as it was filmed in 1941, during the war. For the full (and complicated) plot synopsis, go to TCM.com and "Google" the title. Jack Benny plays his finest movie role of all time and it is Carole Lombard's last film, as she died tragically two months later in an airplane crash near Las Vegas. The running gag: Every time Tura (Jack Benny) recites Hamlet's famous "To Be or Not To Be" soliloquy, somebody in the audience gets up and leaves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A troupe of Polish actors impersonate Nazis in order to prevent the Polish underground from being captured.Jack Benny used to joke on radio and TV about his movie career, especially The Horn Blows at Midnight (1945). But he never joked about this film. Though it's got a serious subject right on the eve of WWII, it's still pretty funny, especially when Jack pulls his egotistical, great actor bit. With all the Heil Hitlers and Gestapo boys running around, it's sometimes hard to keep up with who's who. Nonetheless, it's a clever screenplay having an actors' troupe impersonate Nazi's. Aside from TV's Hogan's Heroes (1965-1971), I don't know of any other show that risked making fun of the murderous Third Reich. It's a pretty tricky topic to begin with, but the production crew pulls it off.Then there's Carole Lombard, on the eve of her tragic plane ride. But she's still delicious as heck. Plus, I could swear that silken gown she's got on for her tryst is all she's got on. My eyes were glued. Also, it's easy to catch a young, love-struck Robert Stack before he got out of the movie's second row and moved into the hard case cop on TV's The Untouchables (1959-1963). Note too, the unspoken Jewish subtext, with the names of many of the victims and Shylock's moving plea from Shakespeare. I don't know why the script made do with inference rather than a single overt mention of Nazism's virulent anti-Semitism. Maybe it's because that might sound like special pleading, regardless of the merits.Anyway, it's still a pretty funny movie, and remains an offbeat one-of-a-kind. Besides Benny had a much better film career than he wanted to admit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deft Delightful &amp; Dangerously Hilarious Nazi Satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one else but Ernst Lubitsch could have made To Be or Not to Be. That it's superb and sublime and witty and ingeniously funny cannot be emphasized enough. The film has a great script, direction and cinematography (Rudolph Maté).While the entire cast shines, Lombard and Benny are absolutely stellar. It's a shame that Benny did not get matched with similarly genius director post-TBONTB is a real shame because with the right director and script he could have gone on to be a film star. Perhaps the fact that much of the story takes place in a theatre and then on the many theatre troupe's "stages" as they foil the Nazis throughout the story, nurtured Benny's own natural unique comedic talent in a way that his other films could not.And then there's Lombard. Carole Lombard was and still is imho, the best comedic actor other than Chaplin-Lloyd-Keaton-Dressler-Stanwyck. I don't find that the comedians of today can even come close to the previously mentioned comedians. Lombard and Benny play the most perfectly narcissistic clever power-couple seen anywhere in film or real life. That this was Lomabrd's final film before her tragic death (plane crash during a war bond tour) is sad for all of us. Her seduction of the dashing young Robert Stack's Lt. Sobinski and the evil double-agent, Professor Siletski (Stanley Ridges)is wonderful to watch. The petty banter between the egomaniacal husband and wife acting team, the Turas (Lombard and Benny) is equally delightful. Also worth mentioning is Lombard's maid, Anna (Maude Eburne) who has some great lines like, "What a husband doesn't know won't hurt his wife." While audiences in 1941/42 may not have been able to appreciate this satire,it's worth noting that Roberto Benigni's film Life Is Beautiful (which has a higher IMDb rating) was also criticized for mixing humor in a story about the holocaust when screened at Cannes in 1997. Some people were outraged that Benigni would include comedy in the concentration camp scenes. But the film went on to win several top awards. Another film which comes to mind mixing war/genocide with comedy in a very skillful way is Arthur Penn's, Little Big Man (1970-based on a novel of the same name by Thomas Berger). I don't know if there were any criticisms of comedy being used in a movie about the genocide of Native Americans but in my opinion, Little Big Man, although a different style than TBONTB, is a superior comedy about a very serious and tragic time in America's history.I believe these knee jerk reactions to films which show or allude to barbaric shameful historic events are without merit. For it's art which brings light to not only these man-made horrors but illuminates the beauty and power of the human spirit.Lubitsch's To Be or Not to Be should not be over-looked. It's one of the finest examples of comedy from any era. Plus you get to watch Lombard and Benny at their most sublime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" A laugh is nothing to be sneezed at ".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently reading an article on the Timeout website about movies which failed badly on there original release that deserve to be re-appraise,I noticed in amongst the more recent titles was a Screwball Comedy from the 40's involving Nazi's.Being interested in seeing how a movie made during WWII could look at the then current events in a comedic light,I decided to import the only DVD edition of the film I could find,and get set to find out how LOL got put together with Nazi.The plot:As a Polish theatre company starts to gather ideas for a new production called "Gastarpo",that along with being a satirical play about the Nazis,is also going to be lead by the company's lead actor Joseph Tura playing a lookalike version of Hitler.With only a few more performances of Hamlet to go before Gastrarpo enters production,Tura starts to experience terrible anxiety attacks due to his wife, (fellow stage performer Maria Tura) getting bundles of flowers from a secret admirer and also due to one individual always being in the audience and each time publicly stepping out as soon as Joseph gets on stage.Unbeknownst to Joseph,the man who is sending his wife flowers and the audience member who keeps walking out are both the same person:Lieut. Stanislav Sobinski.Since setting their eyes on each other for the first time,Maria and Sobinski have both fallen deeply head over heels for each other.As Maria and Stanislav's affair intensifies,and the theatre company also starts its countdown for the premier of Gastarpo,Hitler invades Poland and destroys anything which threatens to mock the authority of the Nazis.Whilst Joseph,Maria and the rest of the actors go into hiding to join the resistances,Sobinski rushes to join the British Polish division of the RAF to do everything he can to fight for his country.Returning to London after a recent raid,Sobinski and a group of fellow solider's meet a leading polish Resistance leader called Prof. Siletsky.Proudly saying that he is about to return to Poland to continue his support for the Resistance,Siletsky offers all of the soldiers a chance to each give him a message that he can pass on to their love ones.Thinking that this may be his only chance to give her a message,Sobinski ask Siletsky to give a message to Poland's most famous actress,who Siletsky has never heard of before!..After having given him the message,Sobinski begins to fear that Siletsky may not be all that he seems.View on the film:Writing the screenplay a few months before America got fully involved in WWII,screenwriter's Melchior Lengyel,Edwin Justus Mayer and Ernst Lubitsch strike a remarkable balance of never playing down the grim situation that the characters are involved in,whilst also having each of the cast members deliver still-razor sharp satirical dialogue,that is truly ahead of its time in its design to prick the pompous,authoritarian image of Hitler and the Nazis.From the moment that Hitler cancel's the production of Gastarpo,the writer's show act-or Joseph Tura, (played by a great,egotistical Jack Benny) to be a two bit old ham,whose dream is to use the role of Hitler so that he can soon become a Lawrance Oliveria style legend in the theatre world.Allowing the tremendous,screwball dialogue to move at lightning speed,co-writer/director Ernst Lubitsch also displays real skill in knowing when to slow the exchanges down,to focus on the troubles that the character's are caught in,with the scenes that revel Prof. Siletsky, (played by a wonderfully deranged Stanley Ridgers) true intension being filmed in tight angles,amped up in tension Werner R. Heymann's terrific score.For what would tragically be her final role,stunning Carole Lombard gives a blistering performance as Joseph's less than faithful wife Maria.Along with smoothly handling the film's dramatic moments,as Maria begins to get closer to finding out Siletsky's true intension's,Lombard also clearly displays a true joy for delivering zingers left,right and centre,from doing everything to keep her husband's suspicion's of an affair at bay,to wooing everyone in sight of her figure-hugging dress in an attempt to escape from a Nazi bedroom,which all help to make Lombard's curtain call performance one that will continue to be applauded for years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We're in Poland, just as a theatre company rehearses their production of a new play, 'Gestapo'. The year is 1939, and the Nazis are about to invade and attack Warsaw. The Turas, an indifferent acting couple (Benny and Lombard) are playing in Hamlet, and Lombard has an ardent admirer in flyer Robert Stack.Once the war begins the film takes flight into a fairly funny interpretation of mistaken identities and ham acting. It also has its serious side, attempting to focus on the dark side of Nazism while simultaneously depicting its followers as buffoons.Good though it is, I'm just not sure what it is trying to achieve. It isn't hilarious, it is more 'cue a smile' funny. Jack Benny can be tedious at the best of times, but he is bearable here. Carole Lombard is very good (of course this was her last role before being killed in an air crash a few days after filming wrapped), as are several of the support cast. It is just ultimately a little disappointing - perhaps something more bitingly satirical would have made more sense?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comedies rarely live up to high praise, for whatever the reason, so I won't go to great lengths building up how great I think this film is, although I really think this is a great film. Sure, there are inconsistencies that would be easy to point out, such as the across all borders shared language between the characters from Poland, Germany and Great Britain. Or I could banter on about how unlikely a pairing Jospeh Tura (Jack Benny) and Maria Tura (Carole Lombard) make as husband and wife. Or perhaps you just find the subject matter of the Nazi's rise to power something not to be taken into the cinema for frivolous laughs.But really this is part of the charm of the film. The film moves between the absurd to the dramatic, though mostly to the absurd, with such ease and flair that the viewing experience becomes a joy, you forgive all of the filmic shortcomings, the suspension of belief, and yes, the arena for bad taste.The film isn't short on its poignant moments either. The destroyed shop signs of the local merchants towards the beginning of the film help to put a real face on the destruction of war. These aren't just brick buildings being leveled, these are names. There's also the 'once in a lifetime' performance Greenberg (Felix Bressart) gives to his best friend, Bronski (Tom Dugan) who is dressed up in a ruse as Hitler to help create a diversion for escape. This scene hits the marks on a couple of levels; it speaks candidly about the lust for war and its adverse effects and it gives Greenberg his one chance to play the part he's wanted to play all of his life. And he plays it as if his life literally depends on it.Most of the film showcases Benny having to outwit Nazi buffoons by dressing up as high ranking Gestapo agents or spies, all the while trying to get to the bottom of an affair his wife is having with a Polish Air Force Lieutenant (Robert Stack).Lombard and Benny are great; they hold most of the film together. Most of what you see from the Nazi side is portrayed in the way that you would come to expect; the Nazi as grand buffoon. Again, this is a minor gaff in the film. The double agent Professor Siletsky (Stanley Ridges) plays his part perfectly and is not played as a buffoon.The film has lots of running gags that are hilarious and it shouldn't disappoint. It may be cliché to say this about this movie, but it really is a minor masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>U S Not in World War II When Lubitsch Classic Conceived and Filmed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many of the comments about To Be and Not To Be dwell on Lubitsch and everyone else's poor taste in making a comedy about war during World War II. However, this movie was conceived and shooting -- but perhaps not editing -- probably already finished by Sunday, December 7, 1941, when the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor followed by Nazi Germany's declaration of war against the United States brought the USA into a global war.Yes, many did think it was inevitable that America enter World War II as a combatant to assist the Western Democracies, but few probably thought that time would come as early as the late Fall of 1941 and as a result of a Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.This Lubitsch masterpiece does have some loose ends; but all in all, it is a superb comedy. Comedy, in my not so humble opinion, is not necessarily a vehicle that promotes side-splitting guffaws which To Be or Not To Be does not except in a few places --"Concentration Camp Ehrhardt" with its repeated repetitions by the real and fake Professor Siletskys as well as the fake and real Col. Ehrhardts.Jack Benny's timing is superb. Carole Lombard, to quote Louella Parsons's oft-written and quoted comment about Marion Davies, "never looked lovelier." Lombard, one of the queens of 1930's madcap comedies, of which To Be or Not To Be is definitely not, underplays her role with a consistency that is magnificent -- had she matured so much as an actress since The Twentieth Century and Nothing Sacred or is this a testament to Lubitsch's magic as a director? One needs to remember when this film was actually made not when it was released to put it into true perspective. It is a sad thing that it has taken so many years for the Ernst Lubitsch production of To Be or Not To Be to be recognized for the magnificent comedy it actually is instead of being panned for being politically incorrect in light of what occurred or was made known of after it was made.This movie does hold up with repeated viewings. So, do not watch it just once and go onto the latest Tom Cruise release on DVD, watch To Be or Not To Be again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the great comedies of all time, by a master, Ernst Lubitsch. Practically a flawless film, damning to the Nazis, ennobling the Polish resistance.Benny is wonderful as "that great, great actor, Josef Tura", making use of his trademark pause and stare. This was the last role of Carole Lombard, tragically killed in a plane crash on the homeward leg of a war bond selling tour, and she is magnificent. Truly she was THE comedienne of the late 1930's and early 1940's.I also need to mention the work of (in my opinion) the greatest comic supporting actor ever--Sig Rumann. Unfortunately, few people remember him, except as a caricature. Forget John Banner as Sgt. Schultz. Look for Rumann in "A Night at the Opera", and "Stalag 17". This was a great man.At all costs, avoid the Mel Brooks remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to recognize how utterly daring this film probably was at the time of its release. Charles Chaplin was put on a death list by Hitler for lampooning him in "The Great Dictator" in 1940, and while Ernst Lubitsch's film isn't quite as scathing as Chaplin's, I still have to think that so openly mocking the Gestapo while the war was still raging took a lot of guts for everyone involved.This isn't necessarily a laugh out loud comedy; there are no really big laughs to be had. But it's never once less than delightful to watch, and all of the performances are terrific. Of course, the most praise must go to Jack Benny, who seems so utterly comfortable on screen, but Carole Lombard is as sexy and engaging as ever, even if she has quite a bit less to do.Very funny, very entertaining, and probably a must see from the period of war-time cinema.Grade: A</fullReview>

Jack Benny and Carole Lombard are great but I will always have to say my favorite person in the movie was Sig Ruman. How he got most of the great lines over Benny, is beyond me. Only Robert Stack got the short end. Most of the time he was the straight man and compared to the rest of the cast came off looking a little stiff but someone had to carry the plot along.

		<shortDescription>Odd Parallel to "Strangelove"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TO BE OR NOT TO BE is a fast-paced comedy / drama with an extremely entertaining script and some very clever plot twists. Carole is amazing in what was tragically her last role; Jack a little less stunning but still very good; and the supporting cast is outstanding. While just about everyone appreciates the humor, many find it difficult to reconcile a film made in the context of 1942 which pokes fun at the Nazis (then a very real threat to the free world), the plight of the poles, and makes light of concentration camps. These are fair objections -- I find it hard to believe that someone could have watched this movie in 1942 and found it amusing. Combined with Carole's tragic death just shortly before its release, and it's easy to understand why TO BE OR NOT TO BE flopped. As an aside, I will point out that the term "concentration camp" was not nearly as odious in 1942 as we understand it today. While the US knew that such camps existed, the general understanding was that they were internment camps for political dissidents, not extermination camps -- and certainly not on the scale of over 6 million murdered. Thus, while the concentration camp references are the singularly most tasteless element of TO BE OR NOT TO BE when we watch it today, it would have been less so in 1942.My primary observation was that this film is an interesting parallel to DR. STRANGELOVE -- both are set *and released* during war (World War II and the Cold War, respectively), both are irreverent, both attempt to be humorous with elements of drama. I've never been a big fan of STRANGELOVE because I can't reconcile making light of global nuclear destruction at a time when it was considered very likely. Oddly enough, I didn't have the same problem with TO BE OR NOT TO BE. I can only conclude that (1) I prefer Jack Benny's version of humor to Stanley Kubricks's and (2) I can appreciate irreverence at the expense of the Nazis as opposed to mocking the western governments (primarily the Americans) and their (depicted) haphazard response to a nuclear threat.I may be off the mark on this, but they were my initial thoughts, and I think it makes an interesting comparison if nothing else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding War Time Comedy with Dark Humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ernst Lubitch's "To Be Or Not To Be"(1943) has to be the most genuinely bizarre political satire to emerge from Hollywood's golden age. It stars Jack Benny and Carol Lombard as Joseph and Maria Tura - a married couple and stage performers living in occupied Poland during WWII. Determined to alter the course of the war, the two helm a troupe of ham actors in a dead pan comic assault on the Nazis When a spy emerges who has damaging information to the Polish resistance, Joseph and Maria decide to prevent the information from being delivered to the Reich. Benny's brilliant lampoon of Hamlet's soliloquy "to be or not to be" is at the crux of a disastrous rendezvous between Maria and Lt. Stanislav Sobinski (Robert Stack). Stan gets the hots for Maria - a passion not reciprocated. Hence, when Stan is dispatched for war, he cruelly implicates Maria with Professor Siletsky (Stanley Ridges), the real spy who has a secret plan to destroy the Warsaw resistance. The theater troupe is then forced to use their thespian skills to ensure their own survival; impersonating Nazi officers and even Hitler in order to outwit the enemy. Controversial to say the very least, "To Be Or Not to Be" opened to modest acclaim and was later remade, to limited effect, as a 1983 farce starring Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft.Warner's DVD treatment is middle of the road. The black and white image has been mastered from reasonably clean film elements. Contrast levels are adequate, though at times weak. There's a hint of edge enhancement and some fine detail shimmering, but nothing that will distract. Fine details are sometimes nicely realized but darker scenes suffer from inconsistent quality. Film grain is moderate. Age related artifacts are present throughout. An archival news reel and short subject are the only extras included.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Benny as Hamlet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the great movie farces of all time. I would rank it very close to my all time favorite "Dr. Strangelove." There are several tiers of interpretation as is true of any noteworthy satire. It is not only poking fun at the stupidity and vanity of Nazism, but at aggressive war in general. Referring to Joseph Tura (Jack Benny) playing Hamlet on stage, Colonel Ehrhardt (Sig Ruman) states, "What he did to Shakespeare we are doing to Poland." Only someone with the comic genius of Ernst Lubitsch could compare the Thespian rape of Shakespeare with the physical rape of a country and make it work.Jack Benny, although one of the most popular entertainers of all time, never got his just deserts for his acting abilities. Though he utilizes many of his physical mannerisms that worked so well for his comedy routines on radio, in the movies, and later on TV, he also does some very fine acting in "To Be Or Not To Be." He is teamed with the multi-talented Carole Lombard yet keeps up with her all the way. The two work well together. Had Carole Lombard not been tragically killed in a plane crash while serving her country just before the release of this film, she would possibly have been teamed with Benny again. The rest of the cast, including newcomer Robert Stack, keep up the pace and give all the support needed to make Lubitsch's film a winner, in particular the histrionics of Sig Ruman, the definitive Nazi stooge, later parodied in the popular TV series "Hogan's Heroes."The script which Lubitsch himself helped put together blossoms with hilarious one-liners such as "So they call me Concentration Camp Ehrhardt?" To read a few of the most famous ones, see IMDb quotes for the film. Better still, rent or buy a copy of this classic and watch it a few times to hear them for yourself. IMDb only lists some, not all, for that would take several pages.The story sounds like one for a typical romantic or screwball type comedy. A troupe of Shakespearean actors in Warsaw, Poland, appear to be on the road to success due to the fame of the leading lady, Maria Tura (Carole Lombard). Her husband, Joseph (Benny), seems to be in her shadow, though he does his best as the Prince of Denmark, Hamlet. Yet each time he does the famous soliloquy that begins, "To be or not to be," the same man gets up and walks out. This leads Joseph to think he is a failure as Hamlet until later in the film he learns that the young man, Lt. Stanislav Sobinski (Robert Stack), is leaving each time for a rendezvous with Joseph's wife, Maria. At this point Hitler invades Poland and the theater is closed as the Nazi's come to town. A Nazi professor, Prof. Alexander Siletsky (Stanley Ridges), flies in with a list of names of traitors (Polish patriots) who are to be taken care of by the local Gestapo headed by Col. Ehrhardt (Ruman). It is up to the Shakespearean troupe to keep these names out of the hands of the Gestapo and then to escape with their lives. So they use their acting talents to impersonate Gestapo officers and even Hitler himself. Joseph becomes Ehrhardt but botches it when the professor brings up the relationship between Maria and Lt. Sobinski who is now in Warsaw also. The rest of the film involves several funny mix-ups and mistaken identities filled with satirical buffoonery. Though this was somewhat controversial when first released because some, including Jack Benny's own father, misunderstood the satire, the film is possibly even more funny and relevant today than during World War II when the Nazi menace was for real. Because Lubitsch made the spoof universal in nature, "To Be Or Not To Be" transcends time and space.</fullReview>

As for the original 1942 version, it is humorous, especially when you have Jack Benny playing the lead, but there are some moments of serious overtones.As the smitten lover, Robert Stack was incredibly wooden here. Perhaps, we can blame it on the fact that he was just beginning his career and given very little to say here.Sig Ruman is a standout as usual as Concentration Camp Earhardt, eagerly ready to blame his failings on Schultz.

		<fullReview>JACK BENNY and CAROLE LOMBARD are ideally cast as a ham actor and his zany actress wife in TO BE OR NOT TO BE, a story of Poland facing the Nazi invasion and how a theater troupe gets to do some real acting by fooling the Nazi authorities.The real comedy highlight of the film is SIG RUMAN as Col. Ehrhardt, foolishly thinking that Benny is a loyal German involved in spying activities for the Fuhrer and afraid of showing any disloyalty to Hitler by telling Earhardt a joke poking fun at the Fuhrer. His scenes with Benny and Lombard are a joy to watch.ROBERT STACK plays the young pilot who always walks out on Benny's "to be or not to be" oration as soon as it begins, for reasons unclear to Benny. STANLEY RIDGES does a nice job as the real professor doing the spying for Hitler, the man Benny must impersonate with some hilarious results.Must have seemed way ahead of its time in '42. Sadly, it was Lombard's last film. Shortly after filming ended, she went on a bond selling tour and was killed in a plane crash on her return to Hollywood and Clark Gable, her husband.Throughout, the direction is well paced and assured under Ernst Lubitsch's clever and light-hearted touch. Well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Be or Not to Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remembered the title obviously because of the William Shakespeare soliloquy, and that it featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, but I didn't know anything about it being a comedy or war film, I was watching though with it being five stars out of five. Basically, set in World War II, we look at the occupants of a Polish theatre company while the country is invaded by the Nazi Germans, and particularly the antics of "great great" actor Joseph Tura (Jack Benny) and his actress wife Maria Tura (Carole Lombard, in her last film). The film has an odd opening with Adolf Hitler in the middle of Warsaw, but it is actually actor Bronski (Tom Dugan) proving his fellow actors that his resemblance to the real Hitler is uncanny, but a little girl recognises him and asks for his autograph. Then we see the production company putting on Shakespeare's Hamlet, with Bronski saying with his friend and colleague Greenberg (Felix Bressart) that he wants a starring role, i.e. "carry the spear", and Greenberg says he'd love to play Shylock. Then we see Maria getting a bouquet of flowers from young pilot Lieut. Stanislav Sobinski (Robert Stack), and the arrange to meet when her husband Joseph is one stage as Hamlet playing the famous "to be or not to be" speech, and someone blatantly walking out, Maria and Sobinski begin an affair before he has to leave to join the war fight. When Sobinski gets to his Polish division for the British Royal Air Force he meets resistance leader Professor Siletsky (Stanley Ridges), but he gets suspicions when he asks the Professor to pass a message to Maria, but he has never heard of the famous actress, even living in Poland for ages. Back in Warsaw Maria herself is taken by two Nazi soldiers to Siletsky who does pass on the message, but then he wants to recruit her as a spy for the Nazis, she pretends to be interested and leaves with an excuse. Telling about what happened she gets her husband Joseph keen to do what needs to be done, killing the Professor, so when Maria returns to him she pretends to find him attractive, and members of the production company pretend to take him to Gestapo. But in fact he is taken to the theatre disguised with props and Joseph disguised as Col. Ehrhardt, hoping to get valuable Nazi information, and with his nerves he cannot help repeating the words "so they call me Concentration Camp Ehrhardt?", and the Professor realises he's been duped, but being chased he is shot himself. Now Joseph disguises himself as Siletsky with a fake beard and glasses to destroy information that must not be found, but he is unintentionally taken to the real Col. Ehrhardt (Sig Ruman) to give a report, and he smooths his way through the meeting, and manages to find out Hitler will be visiting Poland. The next day the real Siletsky's body is discovered, but Joseph does not find out before he goes for another meeting with Ehrhardt, so he placed in a room with the body, and he tries to dupe his way in making it look like the body is the one in disguise, quickly shaving his beard and putting on his spare fake one, and when he is about to escape the actors turn up to take off the other fake beard and pretend to take him to prison. Then the biggest event the actors have faced comes along, Hitler and many others are attending a play in the country, and Bronski dons his convincing Hitler moustache again and get in unnoticed, and Joseph is disguised as the head of the Führer's men. After whatever happens there Maria is ready to leave with the other actors, but Ehrhardt suddenly shows up trying to seduce her, and she is saved by his shock of seeing Bronski in his Hitler disguise, allowing her to walk out. All the actors are on Hitler's plane and easily dispose of the Nazis on board as they mindlessly obey orders from disguised Bronski to simply jump out without parachutes, they land and after the little surprise at the disguised actor they are praised as heroes, and asked what reward they want Joseph is interrupted by Maria saying "he wants to play Hamlet". The end of the film sees Joseph indeed playing Hamlet on stage and eyeballing Sobinski in the audience as he says the words "to be or not to be", as it triggered the hypnotised walk out reaction, but he instead has a new young man walk out. Also starring Lionel Atwill as Rawitch, Charles Halton as Producer Dobosh and Maude Eburne as Anna. Obviously World War II was actually going on at the time, so that is the only way they could get away with the bad taste jokes that are impossible to remake and recreate in modern time (even though a remake was tried with Mel Brooks in 1983), but it is not just the comedy that is great, the cast led by Benny and Lombard are terrific, and there is some poignancy to what is going on, a most watchable Second World War satire. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for Werner R. Heymann. It was number 49 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, and it was number 85 on The 100 Greatest War Films. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever, Funny, Well-Acted Comedy Adventure Of Polish Theatre Troupe Outwitting Nazi Invaders</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Josef and Maria Tura are husband-and-wife actors running a theatre company in Warsaw in 1939 when Germany invades Poland. By chance, they discover that visiting Professor Siletsky is a Nazi agent with a crucial report on the resistance, and resolve to use all their acting skills to stop him getting those names to the High Command.This hilarious and ingenious classic screwball comedy is one of the funniest films of the forties, and for my money the highlight of Lubitsch, Benny and Lombard's careers. It's a great satire of acting vanity, a bravura piece of anti-Nazi propaganda, but most of all an immensely enjoyable crazy story of people pretending to be someone they're not. Benny and Lombard are both sensational - he's haughty but long-suffering and she's wicked but jovial - and the supporting cast are full of great performers. Atwill was often accused of hamming it up (see Mystery Of The Wax Museum from 1933) but here he is given carte blanche to do so, and Ruman is outstanding in the choice comic part of Colonel Ehrhardt the buffoonish Gestapo officer (for more of his genius, check out the Marx Brothers' A Night At The Opera and A Day At The Races). Brilliantly written by Edwin Justus Mayer, based on a story by Melchior Lengyel. Tragically, blonde bombshell Lombard, a terrific actress and comedienne and a huge star in her day, was killed in a plane crash a couple of months before the film's release. A truly inspired comedy classic; don't miss the excellent 1983 colour remake starring real life husband-and-wife Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft, a rare instance of a remake which is every bit as good as the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably one of the most smart movie ever made and the witty of them all. The satire, especialy regarding the absurdity of a pascist and tyrannic regime, is perfect. Together with Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator', that was made (more or less) at the same time, they are Hollywood's bright answers to what was going on in Europe at the same time. I can conclude that this shows that a funny movie and a good laugh never goes out of style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one is just one funny farce all the way through. Doeesn't hurt Jack Benny is as good as he's ever been on film. To me this was his film. Lombard is in this a lot but she's not near as good as Jack Benny.This film is about 90% comedy and 10% serious. The opening scene comes up and immediately you start to see where Charlie Chaplin and Mel brooks got their inspiration. They got it from a fictitious Polish acting troop trying to put on a farcical play about Hitler (of course Mr. Brooks remade this but it's not in the same league).Not a lot has to be said about this, you just have to watch it and see. An all around funny film. I can see why it has high user ratings in here. Really good stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent but disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes classics live up to their reputations and sometimes they don't. This one didn't. It wasn't bad - some quite funny bits, likeable, never boring, but nothing outstanding, except perhaps in the subject matter. I've been watching a few Lubitsch movies recently and I ended up watching this one within a few days of watching Shop Around the Corner. I was struck by how much sharper and wittier "Shop" (which I felt was everything it was cracked up to be) was in comparison to To Be or Not To Be. Benny's character was a little too buffoonish, Lombard's character was a little too boring (though the first scene between Ehrhardt and the false Siletsky was excellent). Unfortunately, this film was just a little too over-the-top, silly, and conveniently plotted, without ever tapping into the fun of a real screwball comedy. Oh well...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dissenting opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie about a company of Polish actors during the Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939 does have laughs (Hitler's "Heil myself!") and it is intricately and cleverly plotted and plays well as an intrigue. But I had a hard time with the mixing of comedy within the context of a real setting. One minute we are witnessing an air raid on Warsaw and the next we have Carol Lombard imagining what a triumph it would be to play the role of a concentration camp victim wearing an elegant dress. Maybe that was meant to illustrate the dominance of personal ego even in the face of tragedy, but the mood shifts were too much for me.The Nazis are made to appear as easily duped buffoons. Mocking the insanely serious using comedy can work, but it has to be done with some idea of a payoff other than a few laughs. What is the point of making a high-ranking Nazi appear a fool? Is such misrepresentation meant to give comfort in having those viewers in 1942 think that the Nazis would be pushovers? Is being made to believe that Nazis are easily persuaded by simple ruses a worthy goal? I don't see it.I ask myself why this film and Benigni's "Life is Beautiful" seriously bothered me whereas I found Chaplin's "The Great Dictator" and Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove" hilarious and trenchant. I think it is because the latter two are marked as satire from beginning to end, whereas the former two are stories set in a real time and place. While the targets of Chaplin's barbs in "The Great Dictator" are immediately obvious, the slight remove from reality makes all the difference.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good flick, but a little uneven; 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Be or Not to Be is an interesting WWII era film about actors in Poland who lead a resistance against the invading Nazis. It is mostly a comedy, but there is a dramatic side to the proceedings. The acting is good, especially Jack Benny. Most of the rest of the actors don't do anything particularly special, except for maybe Robert Stack. Unfortunately, as good as this film is, it has a difficult time reconciling its dramatic angle with its comedic angle. First of all, most WWII movies that were made in America during WWII are a little weak because the makers could only guess at what was really going on in Europe before the US entered the war. The best example of that is Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator. Chaplin himself said that he could have never made that film if he had known what was really going on. Ditto To Be or Not to Be. After having seen the atrocities which happened in Poland in a film like Schindler's List (although I believe the massacre I'm thinking of from that film happened in Krakow; I have not seen it for a long time) really ruins you for a film like this. However, even if it were not weakened by the actual history, the film still has problems reconciling. Robert Stack's role is never really resolved, for instance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts Well But Fizzles Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie begins in Warsaw, Poland in 1939, in the days just before the invasion by Germany and the USSR (though the movie disregards the latter). Though the threat of war is in the air, a theater company's actors and staff spend their time worrying and arguing over theatrical roles and their status in the company. Also, a young bomber pilot has his eye upon an actor's wife (who is an actress herself), and tries to enter an affair with her.The invasion comes. Most of the company has fled Poland, including the pilot, who has joined the Polish exile forces in Britain. However, the actor and his actress wife remain. A professor is sent from Britain to Poland to help the resistance there...but he becomes suspected as a double agent, and the pilot is sent to Poland to stop the professor's intended treachery. He warns the actors who are still there, and they in turn impersonate various Gestapo members to try to foil the professor. Unfortunately for the pilot, the husband he tried to cuckold is upset with him, which complicates things.And unfortunately, it makes everything too complicated and confusing, and ruins the rest of the movie. Also not helping was the joke about "Concentration Camp Gerhardt" which became irritating after being repeated a dozen times. Also, many scenes went on for far too long after they made their point. The movie is notable mainly for being a period piece; as a farce it dropped the ball.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Age does not become that film very well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A decent little film shot in 1942. Could we say it was shot dead? Or is that too Jewish a piece of humor? The plot is absurd and that is why it is funny, but not a deep intellectual funny, nor a deep artistic and esthetic funny, nor even a deep emotional funny. Just funny for war time, funny for when everyone is crying, weeping or plain dying. We think of the other Jewish actor who did a similar impersonation of Hitler, Charlie Chaplin. But Charlie Chaplin played the real Hitler, whereas here it is always a false Hitler, tricking the real one in his back. That is funny for sure but that is also kind of vain, except if you take it is as a plain entertainment for an audience that wants to laugh at their arch enemy. So they play the Mickey out of him. But what's left after sixty or more years? Not much except the scene about "to be or not to be", played three times on a stage in the context of Hamlet in the film. The force of this sequence is in the fact that an actor plays Hamlet in front of an audience and a member of that audience stands up and walks out on him when he says that sentence, and the scene is of course in front of another audience, us. The second level of that distantiation is what makes it funny because we can see the varying surprise and anger of the actor who takes it as an insult before he learns it was coded language. And it is true Ehrard has it right when he says that what this Tura actor did to Shakespeare, they, the Nazis, are doing it to Poland. But then the third time, and that is only true for us, though also for one person in the audience in the theater in the film, it becomes absurd because there is no explanation for that total stranger to stand up and walk out. But apart from that the film has aged tremendously and even the acting has aged and seems so unnatural, though we can accept that from most of the main actors who are supposed to be actors and hence to play a role, even in real life. The only important thing is that in 1942 the film is heavily speaking of concentration camps. If Lubitsch knew about it, why didn't the allies know about it and why didn't they do something to stop the massacre? At least they had no excuse and they cannot pretend they were less informed than Lubitsch. That's the only interesting point of that film still today.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delightful comedy that, unfortunately, adheres to 40s Hollywood norms.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was not much of an innovator of the Classical Hollywood narrative, but a great example of the style typical of popular wartime films. This a movie with very little if any emphasis on editing and mise-en-scéne as independent stylistic aids, thus, more of a spectacle in its farcical portrayal of zealously ignorant Nazis. A delight to watch, with a wit that eerily foreshadows the coming of Mel Brooks. So, I'd recommend the Brooks remake as well. To WHOM would I recommend this film you ask? The range of viewers who could sit through this sort of film is probably very narrow among young people. But, say you're a history major who just landed a first date with ... another history major, or say you're an unpaid grad student who enjoys intellectual masturbation, and you're engaged to someone like yourself. This movie is for all of you, on a rainy night, Chinese in hand, in a flat somewhere in midtown. Yeah, delightful, whatever, but too TYPICALLY American AND PERFECT. Somewhat glad I didn't grow up watching stuff like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can certainly see why this movie was controversial and had a poor box office turnout when it came out. For the US to have just entered the war, and reconciling the unfolding events with a comedy making light of the situation is extremely questionable.Even now, with the distance of time, having not lived through the horrific events myself, I was still uncomfortable watching this film.Not that it doesn't have funny moments ("Heil myself"), or that you can't make a comedy using serious historical events. But there are just moments where you're a little disgusted at the sheer refusal to really take the situation seriously. For example, People shot are used in the film as jokes or props to a joke. The most eggregious example is when millions of people dying horrifically in the camps is reduced to a joke by a German officer, "We do the concentrating, they do the camping". That's just not funny, it's completely tasteless!!The filim is worth watching, it is funny and has lots of snappy dialogue and plot twists - but I think it is important to think about the implications of making and releasing such a film in '42, much less at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some topics lend themselves to satire; genocidal military dictatorships do not. This is perhaps one of the most offensive, ill-conceived movies ever produced in the name of public "entertainment." To portray Nazis as idiotic buffoons and to script in dialogue and insert one- liners about the comedic aspects of concentration camps?well that's got to just be a laugh a minute. And here Jack Benny portrays a pretentious Polish actor, Joseph Tura, which gives Benny full license to present us with his comedy persona in full form. Tura, who craves greatness as Shakespeare's Hamlet is prime Benny, the smug, mocking, self-satisfied comedic fool only satisfied when he can make everyone else look foolish. So guess what?! THAT makes him smart. Got it? Hilarious!This film, Carole Lombard's last, is a sad coda to her sparkling career. Purportedly her husband Clark Gable urged her not to take the part of Maria Tura, but she liked the script?! The esteemed director Fritz Lang, half-Jewish, (his Jewish mother had converted to Catholicism) and an émigré from Nazi Germany who fled that country just in time, should have known better. This movie was a disaster when it was made at the height of World War II, and more than 70 years later is still, to put it mildly, an embarrassment. No matter what Leonard Maltin thinks.</fullReview>
