		<shortDescription>a maligned minor classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of Ernst Lubitsch's wartime comedy has often been dismissed as a ham-fisted and unnecessary vanity exercise. This is grossly unfair, as the Brooks' version is in fact a deft and funny comedy that stands up well in comparison to its forebear. Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft make their own the roles of the Bronskis, a Warsaw theatrical duo ("world famous in Poland")who star in revues at the Bronski theatre. When war breaks out the Bronskis become brood-hens to an ever-growing community of Jewish refugees while staying one step ahead of the Nazis. Brooks and Bancroft are fine in the roles of the battling Bronskis, particularly Mel Brooks who finds a touching level of vulnerability beneath the bombast and bluster of Frederick Bronski. Despite the farcical and improbable plot twists, the narrative is sound and genuine pathos registers throughout the film. Those with fond memories of Jack Benny and Carole Lombard in the lead roles may have boycotted this on first release, but they have denied themselves a rare treat - a sure-footed and genuinely entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely meant "to Be"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen the Ernst Lubitsch original of this gem but if I had, I might have been prejudiced in my decision of this being one of the finer films that Mel Brooks has been in.Though not written by or directed by Mel, he and wife Anne Bancroft take center stage as Frederick and Anna Bronski, Poland's most famous acting family. When the Nazi war machine overtakes Warsaw, they and their acting troupe use every actor's trick in the book to escape and make their way to England.All this, of course, while Anna becomes smitten with an American pilot (Matheson) who helps them both to freedom. In the meantime, there are threats from a devious doctor (Ferrer), a lecherous Nazi colonel (Durning) and a command for the troupe to perform for the Nazi Army with Hitler in the audience.There are so many classic moments here that to list them would be a dis-service to the movie. Let me just say that I enjoyed this whole film from opening to closing and even the closing had some doozies. The Nazis are seen as complete buffoons and the exchanges between Durning and his head officer (Lloyd) are classic. In fact, I can see why Durning was nominated for an Oscar for his role here; not just anyone could have pulled it off as well as he.Everyone here has a good scene or two, including Mel's regulars (Graham, Wyner, Riley) and the dialogue even manages to get the proper sentiment and tension out of the proper scenes. A great effort by all involved. Purists of the Jack Benny original may disagree, but this "To Be or Not to Be" is the "to Be" for me!Ten stars. Mazeltov!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mel Brooks way!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the great Mel Brooks at his best!.He revisits this classic film and makes it even crazier than the original, adding a lot of new stuff... (there are 3 numbers where Mel dances and sings, there are clowns, jews and a homosexual hairdresser pursued by the evil and stupid nazis.)All the actors in this movie, and I mean ALL, are just terrific.I´d like to state that this is not a remake of the Ernst Lubistch classic, (at least that´s my opinion), to me this is a tribute to the great director and his masterpiece.I´ve watched the Lubistch "To be or not to be" a lot of times for it´s one of my favorite films, and the Mel Brooks version is completely different from the original. It was made the Brooks way, which I really adore.So watch this film, you´ll have a lot of fun and won´t stop laughing.Oh, just one more thing...This is an asking to 20th Century Fox: When you decide to release this movie in DVD, include the absolutely amazing video-clip: "To be or not to be - Hitler Rap" performed by Mel Brooks please!!. I can assure you that a lot of people will buy it just for that.(9 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful slapstick at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was so pleased to come across this movie on tv, and found it delightful every step of the way even though it does go "over the top" in its script. I could almost sense Sid Caesar's presence in the group but he was not a part of it here, which I regret.Although the subject matter is serious enough, as it deals with the Nazi military and their activities, there is so much humor to be found in the foibles of citizens and soldiers alike that we are swept up in the steady action.Mel Brook and Anne Bancroft carry the plot along splendidly. I don't think Jose Ferrer had been in many comedies so it was a pleasure to see him take part in this type of film. Good entertainment and full of action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TO BE OR NOT TO BE Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound format: Dolby Stereo1939: As the Nazi's invade their homeland, a humble Warsaw theatre troupe stages a daring escape after stumbling on a Gestapo plot to kill members of the Polish resistance.Whilst the fondly-remembered Ernst Lubitsch original was actually filmed during wartime (1942), at a point when the outcome of the conflict was still uncertain, this updated vehicle for Mel Brooks has no such edge, but Alan Johnson's fast-paced remake at least preserves the elements of comedy and drama which made the earlier film so potent. There aren't many belly laughs to be had from the low-key screenplay (co-written by Thomas Meehan and Ronnie Graham), and the Nazi caricatures are fun without being especially funny (Charles Durning was Oscar-nominated for his role as bumbling Gestapo officer 'Concentration Camp' Erhardt), but the film offers an upbeat mixture of thrills and frivolity, and a superb cast of experienced players take turns stealing the limelight from leading player Brooks (Anne Bancroft has a ball as Brooks' duplicitous wife, easing her marriage blues by encouraging a half-innocent liaison with handsome airman Tim Matheson, who's been assigned by British Intelligence to foil a dastardly plot initiated by double agent Jose Ferrer). As in the original, the movie portrays the Nazi threat in a comic manner whilst constantly reminding viewers of the deadly reality which underpins the narrative, and while the scenario is fast-paced, funny and exciting in equal measure, it's also surprisingly respectful of history. Johnson's unfussy direction keeps things moving along nicely, and production values are efficient throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Homage to Jack Benny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually, when interviewed about this movie, Mel Brooks said it was an homage to Jack Benny. And if you look, the Bronskis live on Kubelsky Street, Benny Kubelsky is Jack Benny's real name. There are many other touches that also show Brooks' love for the original. Anne Bancroft is a true treat. Her comedic talents shine, she was truly a rare actress, and will be missed.It was well done, with Mel Brooksian flair, and respectful of the original. I won't add comments about the acting, there are so many pros and cons at this point, one more won't make a difference. But if you have some free time, see BOTH of the movies. It's not sacrilege to like them both.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most under rated Brooks film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw this I had no idea it was a remake. I didn't know the original had been rated the 49th best comedy of all time by the AFI or that Brooks neither wrote nor directed it.What I knew was that from the moment it started to the moment the curtains came down I was laughing nonstop in awe of an incredible plot. The film managed to escalate with each passing scene. Just when you thought nothing more could be done to it, they managed to push it further and further. Brook's performance was dead on, as was the entire casts. It's the sort of movie that gives Christopher Loyd only seven or eight lines, and you love him for it and need to ask for anything more.It continually makes fun itself, building on jokes you thought were over half a movie ago. I'd place this movie above Spaceballs and below Men in Tights, but would say that it is without a doubt the best plot of any movie I've seen in some time, comedy or otherwise.This is a movie that you should waste no time seeking out and renting, buying, seeing in whatever way you can.Still not sold? I'll retell one of the jokes. Don't read further if you want the first five minutes to be as fresh as they were for me - if you're debating whether to see it or not, I hope this is able to sway you.They're in a theater, putting on a show. We hear the Polish songs - not quite sure what they're singing about. The curtain comes down on the two actors smiling and bowing together as the audience claps. The moment the audience can no longer see them the actors start bickering in Polish. We're not sure what they're discussing, but it's clearly a heated debate. The curtain then comes up, they immediately are smiling, bowing, curtain comes down once again and it's back to the Polish bickering. They continue bickering, stopping for an announcement over the loudspeakers in this vaudeville theater. "Attention, for the Sanity and Clarity of the Audience the rest of this movie will be English"Then the movie switches into English, and the plot begins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lubitsch Touch Or The Brooks Touch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rather than a satire of a film classic like Frankenstein or a genre of films like the western was done in Blazing Saddles, Mel Brooks chose for the one and only time to do a remake of an already very funny film with the classic To Be Or Not To Be. 40 years later the Brooks remake has lost none of the laughs from the original, in fact Brooks could now talk about things unmentionable when Hollywood was under the Code.The 1942 original film that starred Jack Benny, Carole Lombard, and Robert Stack in the roles that Mel Brooks, Anne Bancroft, and Tim Matheson play here, was a sophisticated comedy that was not well received when first out, many thought the Nazis were no subject to joke about during wartime. Over time it gained acceptance as yet another of the masterpieces that Ernest Lubitsch did over his career. It may have been Jack Benny's best big screen performance. It was also Carole Lombard's farewell performance.Benny's comedy was droll, Brooks's humor hits you with a sledgehammer. Still the different approach works out in this remake. Anne Bancroft is more than a good substitute for Carole Lombard, in fact she's as funny in this as Lombard ever was on the screen.Many years ago one of my supervisors knew Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft and he told us at work that her image as a great dramatic actress, whose two career roles are in The Graduate and The Miracle Worker was a total fabrication. Mel Brooks he said was as zany a man in private as he was in film. But he also said that Bancroft was even zanier than he was and had few times to display that in public. In that sense the two were a perfectly matched couple. My supervisor said he lived in the same building as they did in Greenwich Village and got to know both of them.Mel Brooks got to show the effect of the Holocaust to come on gays in one of the first films to acknowledge that publicly. One of the touching performances in the supporting cast is by James Haake as Sascha the dresser for Bancroft who gets a one way ticket to a concentration camp, but the trip gets put on hold permanently by his friends in the theater. Charles Durning also does well as Gestapo head in Warsaw who gets constantly bamboozled almost like World War II era film Nazis by Brooks's ingenuity and his theater troupe who give the best performances of their lives. And we can't forget Jose Ferrer adding yet another ethnic group to his repertoire as the Polish traitor Siletsky.If you're not a fan of Mel Brooks you will become one after you see any of his films. And this review is dedicated to the late Robert Peregoff, one of my supervisors at work who provided me the insights I got into the Brooks-Bancroft screen and life partnership.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>simply superb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>having not seen the Ernst Lubistch original, I came into this film with a blank mind not comparing it to its predecessor. This for me, was a huge plus and I walked away knowing that it was one of the finest comedies I have ever seen. It followed the most basic rule of comedy, in that the plot was simple, yet interesting - meaning that you didn't have to spend time going over the plot in your head (something that can kill a comedy), yet you still maintain interest. Mel Brooks is on stunning form, combining personal depth with superb comedy. Anne Bancroft is strong, yet unforced in a role that seemed almost written for her, and the comic strength of the supporting cast helps add to what is a movie that you can just sit back and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been a big fan of the Jack Benny movie since I was 10 years old. Then, just earlier this year, I sought out the Mel Brooks version. I had become a huge Mel Brooks fan and he is now my favorite entertainer. So I thought I'd see this version just because I sorta kinda had to as a Mel Brooks fanatic. My grandfather (also a big Mel Brooks fan) had seen the film on its release back in 1984 and thought it was a kind of pale copy of the Jack Benny version, which he loves too. But I personally thought that the film was a brilliant motion picture and contained more laffs and better music than the original. This quickly became one of my favorite Mel Brooks movies (even though he didn't direct or write it!) The supporting cast is great, in a different way than the original. Instead of trying to merely copy the original performances, they create their own, equally-funny ones, especially Charles Durning and Christopher Lloyd. Jose Ferrer was great. That underrated Jewish character comic George Wyner was also as funny as ever. Even Ronny Graham had a role as Sondheim("Sondheim, send in the Klowns!") James Haake as Sasha gave a brilliant performance. I wish he'd won an Oscar. Tim Matheson was good in his kind of bland role as the Polish Flier. But of course, the stars are Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft. Their highlights together include a Polish version of "Sweet Georgia Brown." Brooks sings "A Little Peace," "Ladies," and (on the soundtrack album only) "The Hitler Rap."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know that this was a remake of a 1942 Ernst Lubitsch movie, but I've never seen the Lubitsch version. So, the Mel Brooks version of "To Be or Not to Be" is the one that I know. And I really like it. Just as he did in "The Producers", Mel makes the audience laugh hysterically at the Nazis (also accomplished by Charlie Chaplin and Roberto Benigni). Like many movies, it goes to show that humor really is the best way to deal with political issues...and also that Mel didn't have to be completely silly to come up with great ideas. Too bad that Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft didn't co-star more often, as they were definitely a cool team here. You're sure to love it. And just remember what to do the next time that you have to deal with chronic invaders...Also starring Tim Matheson, Charles Durning, Christopher Lloyd and Estelle Reiner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake could not have had a finer cast led the magnificent Mel Brooks and his wife Anne Bancroft. I remembered him saying once that he loved singing and dancing Polish with his wife and now I can see why. They begin the show singing and dancing in Polish. I was surprised by how much they spoke Polish in the beginning. Unlike most Polish depictions, they are not considered to be taken as jokes in this film. They are in Warsaw with their theater troupe. In actuality, Warsaw was destroyed 90% by the war's end so it was probably very unlikely that they could outsmart the Germans but it's not a true story. The Jews wear the yellow Star of Davids and the homosexuals wear the pink triangle. Now the film could have ignored that part of the war but they did not. They wisely incorporated it into the storyline. They remind us of the concentration camps and the certain death that they would have faced. While the stars of the film and the fictional theater troupe, Anne and Frederick Bronski played by Bancroft and Brooks are forced out of their own home to live with their homosexual cast member played memorably by David Haacke in this small one room apartment. The rest of the cast is superb with Charles Durning, Tim Matheson as the young military man in love with Anna, Estelle Reiner, George Gaines, George Wyner, etc. Anne Bancroft is positively beautiful and glowing in her performance. She is truly a star and we know Mel loved her to death and she loved him in life as well. I don't get into the plot because I don't want to spoil it. It's worth watching again and again. Rest in peace, Anne.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The older I get, and the more I am exposed to great ideas in film, especially comics in film, the less I tolerate Brooks.That's because he isn't a filmmaker. Never was. He's a vaudevillian, a stage comic. Now, that can be funny, and I suppose he's good at what he does. But there's a magic in cinema, in cinematic humor that bites deeper. Movies have a solvent when done right, a solvent that allows the humor to catalyze change.When you're on a stage, we expect the performer to be different, remote. We even laugh at the remoteness.Consider the film humor of embarrassment. We have a whole industry based on that, dozens of movies a year. They work because we enter the thing and feel embarrassed. That'll never happen with Brooks because he sees these as filmed stage shows.If you watch this, what you'll get is a rather clever acknowledgment of this. At root it is a simple structure: real world with Nazis, stage show with Nazis. (And of course, we chuckle, knowing Brooks' claim to fame is "Springtime for Hitler.") And as the thing goes on, we have the stage show and reality blurring from both ends.Brooks "plays" certain Nazi characters. And as time goes on the Nazis get more and more like stage characters. One device is rather sophisticated, where the real Nazi is made (by Brooks) to appear as a fake. And yes, Jews escaping as clowns from a pretend truck to a real one.At the center of all this is a valentine from Brooks to his wife. She's allowed to mug, and be the irresistible love interest to all heterosexual men, good and bad.If you go into this for laughs, you'll be disappointed. If you go into it as an essay on humor on the stage, you'll find it pretty darn impressive, worthy of the guy who introduced David Lynch to us through "Elephant Man."Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mel Brooks plays a bad Polish actor Dr. Frederick Bronski and Anne Bancroft plays his wife Anna.She does that also in real life.When the Nazis take over Warsaw they try to find a way to escape to England.To Be or Not to Be (1983) is a real comedy gem that hasn't got a lack of funny moments.If I mentioned them all I would be charged of overdoing.Of course you find some drama also because of the topic.I mean, there's the II Worldwar, the Nazis and the Jews.You can't make that all comedy.But I have to tell you this; if you got a Jewish master of comedy making fun of the Nazis you can't fail.It is noticed that the Jews are the best of comedians.If there was an average gentile comedian there in the lead instead of Mel this movie just wouldn't work so good.When he disguises himself as Hitler, that's just hilarious.The Führer himself was very hilarious.If only he had been only joking.That would have been a bad joke, but still.He and his fellow Nazi clowns are an easy target to make comedy of.The actors playing Nazi parts are superb here.Christopher Lloyd does an excellent job as Capt.Schultz and Charles Durning as Col Erhardt.The casting in this movie is something you have to give credit for.Mr Brooks and Mrs Bancroft make a marvelous couple in the lead.Tim Matheson is brilliant as Lt.Andre Sobinski and José Ferrer is great as Prof. Siletski.To Be or Not to Be is an eternal question that Hamlet kept asking and also the title of this film.But don't expect another version of Shakespeare's play because that's just something you're not gonna get.What you are gonna get is something much funnier.Watch this movie if you wanna die laughing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If it was funny forty years ago, why shouldn't it be funny now. I can imagine that there's an entire sector of social space that has never seen Jack Benny and Carol Lombard in the original. ("I don't watch black-and-white movies.") And if the same sector doesn't have much of a grasp of affairs in Poland in 1940, so much the more informative.Mel Brooks leads a theatrical troupe in Warsaw in 1940 after it was occupied by the Nazis. The plot is too complex to describe in detail but involves a great deal of impersonation, switching uniforms, lambasting the Nazi hierarchy, and poking fun at egotistic actors.The plot and dialog borrow heavily from 1940 but some of the jokes have been brought up to date. I'll mention just two.The troupe is desperately seeking safety from bombs and when they enter the shelter, one actor makes the sign of the cross. The next in line, presumably Jewish, goes through some contortions over his thorax with his fingers. Now, I may be mistaken but I think this is an allusion to an old joke. An airplane in jeopardy finally makes a safe landing. A minister gets off and makes the sign of the cross, as does the priest who follows him. The Rabbi makes a sign too and when asked about it by a reporter, replies, "What sign of the cross? I was just checking -- spectacles, testicles, wallet and watch." The troupe's dresser is openly gay and he explains to Anne Bancroft that he hates having to wear a pink triangle. "It CLASHES with EVERYTHING." The acting was suitably hammy in Ernst Lubitsch's movie. Here, the performances out-Herod Herod. If you want subtlety, see the original. Charles Durning is a fine actor but may be miscast here. Anne Bancroft is beguiling, a splendid and under-rated actress with a skull and a frame sufficiently gracile to die for. I speak to you as your anthropologist. My services come with a fee -- ten cents.You should probably watch this. It's still funny after all these years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fair remake that can't hold a candle to the 1942 original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For anyone who hasn't seen the 1942 original film by this title, and especially for younger audiences today, this 1983 remake of "To Be or Not to Be" may be entertaining. Some may find it quite good. But for those who have seen the earlier film, the two films beg comparison. And when so viewed, this 1983 film can't hold a candle to the 1942 original. Mel Brooks made some funny and very good movies in his day. The best were those in which he satirized the movie industry or society in some way. But, in this film he doesn't satirize the original film. Instead, he plays it straight for the comedy that made the 1942 film. Jack Benny and Carol Lombard starred in the original, which was held up for release until after the U.S. entered the war. But that film was spot-on in its timing and its grilling of Nazi Germany over its invasion of Poland. It was a clear and excellent satire of the time. So, even seeing it many years later, audiences can still connect with it and relish the satire. On the other hand, what satire is there in a film made more than 40 years later? By then, the lampooning of the Nazis was an old and tiring act. Even done as a straight remake ? as one might see a different cast in a Shakespeare play, this newer film is just flat. When it loses the reality and imminence of the threat that the first film portrayed, it also loses the punch and humor of satire. And, if one sets aside the satire ? which is the essence of the story, at least in the initial film ? this 1983 version still falls way short of the 1942 movie. I don't fault Brooks and Anne Bancroft for wanting to do a remake of such a fine film. But Brooks' portrayal of the main male character, Frederick Bronski, seems robotic compared to Jack Benny's Joseph Tura. In places, Brooks seemed to force his hammy acting, whereas Benny's was natural and hilarious. Nor was the rest of the cast in this second production up to the performances of all the supporting players in the 1942 film. In short, this film lacks the energy in the players, and the humor just doesn't come across as spontaneous and natural. One has a sense that this was one large staged remake, and that it became weighed down by the staginess of it. Still, it isn't a total dud. Some of the lines and scenes are funny. They would be, no matter who played them. For those who have enjoyed this film, I recommend getting hold of the original to watch it. It's a wonderful WW II satire made and released early in that war. And the humor is that much funnier, and the satire that much more biting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frederick and Anna Bronski are husband-and-wife actors running a theatre company in Warsaw in 1939 when Germany invades Poland. By chance, they discover that visiting Professor Siletski is a Nazi agent with a crucial report on the resistance, and resolve to use all their acting skills to stop him getting those names to the High Command.This remake of the 1942 Ernst Lubitsch comedy classic is very faithful to its predecessor but is a hugely entertaining picture in its own right. What I like about it most is its terrific cast - Brooks and Bancroft seem almost made for these roles and both are sensational, as are the whole Bronski troupe. Matheson and Ferrer are suitably suave and slimy, but the real stars for me are Durning and Lloyd as Colonel Erhardt and his adjutant Schultz - you can basically never go wrong with a short fat man and a tall thin man as a comedy duo, but these two are hilariously mismatched. The scene where Bronski, disguised as Siletski, delivers his report to Erhardt and the two Nazis scream at each other is a masterpiece of comic bungling. This film's chief addition is Sasha, the gay dresser character, who would never have gotten past the Hays Code, but exemplifies the many moments where Brooks cleverly sprinkles the comedy with sharp reminders of the horrors it's lampooning. It also has much more of a musical element courtesy of a terrific score by John Morris and some funny numbers (who else but Brooks would open with Sweet Georgia Brown in Polish ?). There aren't many straight remakes I'm especially fond of, but this is a definite exception; it's funny, beautifully made, re-tells a great story and is a terrific showcase for the comic talents of its ensemble. Produced by Brooks, and deftly scripted by Thomas Meehan and Ronny Graham (the latter of whom plays Sondheim, the very loud stage manager).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pretty funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin with, it is unfair to compare this to the Lubitsch classic for any number of reasons. First, of course, is that for Lubitsch and his audience, the Second World War was a living issue: Jack Benny threw himself into the Bronski role with such energy because he was of Polish-Jewish family, and had some idea what Nazsm meant for any relatives he might have had in Poland at the time. Although Brooks is also Jewish, the immediate threat Benny and Lubitsch recognized is for Brooks a thing of the past. Nor dare he overplay that hand; for Lubitsch, the full horror of the Holocaust had yet to be discovered; Brooks and his director have to play against our knowledge of it in a way that avoids raising any thoughts of atrocities involved.Also, due to Hollywood censorship issues of the time, that the marriage between the Bronskis is failing because Anna is a nymphomaniac had to be carefully encoded in the dialog of the Lubitsch film, so that only sophisticated adults could understand the full implications of what was being said; even so, the script actually pushes the envelope quite a bit. By the time the Brooks version was made, there was no longer any envelop to push. While this means Brooks and Bancroft can get more explicit about their marital issues, it also means a loss of sophistication.Finally, there is the very look of the film. Director Johnson has avoided any reference to "the Lubitsch touch" which included a certain sparkle to the lighting as well as hip-to-head two-shots intercut with close-ups, and a sweeping, yet highly detailed, set-design. Johnson has gone for a "classical" feel to his movie, but his visual references - lighting, color, composition - are to the 1950s, which quietly emphasizes the sexual farce element of the film, since the '50s were the era of the particularly American sexual farce - Some Like It Hot, The 7 year Itch, Pajama Game, etc.And as an inheritor of the 1950s comedy style, I think this film works pretty well. The characterizations are lively (this is really Brooks at his best) the timing is solid and the pace swift, inconsistencies rapidly vanish and are easily forgiven, the dialog remains amusing and is not fixated by topical references. And there's an undeniable chemistry between Brooks and Bancroft, as well as an ensemble feel to the film as a whole.Taken in its own right, its no classic - but it's a pretty funny movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hamming Hamlet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"To be, or not to be", in this version, while taking the basic idea from the classic by Ernst Lubitsch, is not a copy, but a variation on an idea. Under the direction of Alan Johnson, the film is worth a look because of all the people that were gathered to make a contribution.Who knows what Mel Brooks might have been able to do with this movie, but since he's only acting in it, his hands appear to be tied. The idea of Mr. Brooks as a popular theater actor offers possibilities. His wife, Anna, brilliantly played by (Anne Bancroft) gives us a chance to observe this wonderful couple at the top of their form.Some familiar faces are also seen. Tim Matheson, makes a great ace pilot, secretly in love with Anna. Charles Durning does an excellent portrayal of the Nazi Colonel Ehrhardt. Jose Ferrer is seen in the pivotal role of a traitor.Probably the best scenes involve Mr. Brooks and Ms. Bancroft singing and dancing. Also, Mr. Brooks makes an incredible take off on Hamlet and as Hitler.While the film is not all what one expects, it's gives us an excuse for watching it and still have a good time while at it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mel Brooks Well Remembered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film today on AMC and still laugh my head off at the antics of Mel Brooks and his wife in a remake of this 1942 film which starred Jack Benny and Carole Lombard. Brooks takes his funny equilibrium much further in this and his wife Ann Bancroft assists him in the antics of a ham theater production escaping from the cruel hands of the Nazis. Mel also sings and dances, but his greatest acting job comes from disquising himself as a German professor. They finally escape from the Nazis with the help of Robert Stack as a pilot. Charles Durning plays a German colonel and does a fantastic job of it; you get to hate him and laugh with him! I'd recommend this highly and entertaining! 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a double bill review with Lubitsch's original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An enthralling and ebullient double bill of two versions of TO BE OR NOT TO BE, Lubitsch's Black &amp; White masterpiece, also famous for being Carole Lombard's swan song before a plane crash brought her away from this world at the prime age of 33, and Mel Brooks' (almost) faithful color remade (although the director title falls on the head of his longtime collaborator Alan Johnson) starring him and his wife Ms. Bancroft. It is the same story being transcribed under two different palettes, the remake owes its tongue-in-cheek drollness greatly to the screenwriter Edwin Justus Mayer of the 1942 version since many one-liners are copied verbatim, both versions are abounding with witty caricatures of Hitler and his Nazi regime, embellishes a tall order in the wartime Warsaw with conspicuous burlesque, a Polish acting troupe's collective endeavour to hunt down a German spy and a subsequent flee from war zone to England, during which a crucial tool is that our hero, the ham actor Joseph Tura (Benny) / Frederick Bronski (Brooks), has to playact different characters, from the spy professor, a Nazi colonel and even Hitler himself (in the remake), to bluff his way out; meanwhile he is also vexed by the budding romance between his actor wife Maria (Lombard) / Anna (Bancroft) and a young aviator Lt. Sobieski (Stack) / Lt. Sobinski (Matheson). But there are also apparent differences which can bear out why Lubitsch's original is a much better piece of work, taking the opening sequences for example, Lubitsch starts with a voice-over narrating an unusual happening in Warsaw before WWII, Adolf Hitler is spotted on the street, then a following revelation reveals that it is after all an act, Hitler is played by a character actor who tries to test his resemblance by walking among the mass, what a pleasant surprise! But in the remake, Mel Brooks doesn't adopt this route, instead, he opens with a vaudeville number SWEET GEORGIA BROWN with Bancroft, a fairly impressive stunt but fails to match Lubitsch's ingenious gambit, later audience will discover, one main reason behind this alteration is that there is no role of the character actor who resembles Hitler in this version, as Brooks himself will disguise as Hitler in the final escape scam, so probably it is a sacrifice to fulfil Brooks' own ego to enlarge his part as the star.For most part, the silver-screen magnetism of the original is beguilingly outstrips the remake's more mundane touch, and being a well-intended fairytale, the mundane touch is unfortunately an impediment particularly in the elongated escape plan, the entire operation feels preposterous with the all the chase (don't let me start on the doggie Mutki's eleventh- hour jump) and what happens to the real Hitler in the theatre, he doesn't feel absurd when clearly no actors are on the stage to perform? In the original, this passage is fast-paced with a whimsical take of the fake Hitler ordering two pilots to jump off the plane without parachutes, to mock Nazi's blind obedience.With all my respect to Brooks and Bancroft, but in the remake, they are just too old for their roles, egregiously jarring is Brooks as young Hamlet in his ridicule titular monologue, seriously? I don't consider myself as an ageist, but this is more than a farce to swallow. Bancroft is two-and-a-half decades past her prime as a seductress in THE GRADUATE (1967, 8/10), her comedic bent can never pass beyond the slinky postures. OK. we get it, it is a family business, let the profit kept within one's own turf. However, a big thumb-up for the remake to introduce an openly gay character Sasha (Haake), Anna's dresser, into the plot, in order to carry through the side-splitting wisecrack "how can a theatre survive without Jews, gays and gypsies?". Also Charles Durning usurps an Oscar-nomination for the remake as Col. Erhardt, but having watched the original first, his farcical rendition feels a shade forced compared with Sig Ruman's effortless spontaneity.In the original, the Lombard-and-Benny pair forms a more organic liaison thanks a lot to the retro flair, she is a classic lady with glamour and dignity, he is somewhat childlike but self- consciously over-proud of his acting, their bickering is crammed with spark and tease, even Robert Stack's handsome pilot is dreamier in the vintage silhouette. All in all, it might be unfair for the remake to be viewed immediately after the original, but also the double-bill viewing is a telling corroboration of why vintage classics can obtain their timeless appeal, nostalgia aside, they are absolutely one-of-a-kind in their visual tactility, their characters' mannerism and the streamlined narrative tactics, if you are into it, you cannot get enough of it, as for the remake, maybe it is just not vintage enough, nothing we can do about that, as least for now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heil Myself!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a theater nerd, and a Mel Brooks fan, I was intrigued when I saw this movie on Netflix streaming. I added it to my list and forgot about it. One night, I couldn't find anything to watch, so I decided to stop procrastinating and finally watch the movie. And I was not disappointed. It's not as outrageous as "Blazing Saddles" or "Spaceballs". It's more along the lines of "Young Frankenstein" or "the Producers" where the story is just as important as the jokes. To be honest, I didn't know this was a remake until I saw people saying it was one online. So, I won't compare it to that film. I'm actually shocked that people don't mention this movie when talking about World War II movies. They always focus on the ones about Jewish people, like "Boy in the Striped Pajamas" and "Diary of Anne Frank", not that that's a bad thing, I mean Jewish people were one of the bigger targets. But this one brings up the fact that it wasn't just Jewish people being hauled off to concentration camps. One character is homosexual, and Mel Brooks's character mentions gypsies being taken too. And I appreciate that. The comedy is brilliant. Some jokes are a hit and miss for the causal viewer, but if you know a little bit about theater or World War II, then you should get most of the jokes. In fact, I can see where Brooks got the idea for some of the songs in "the Producers" Broadway show, like "Heil Myself", "It's Bad Luck to Say Good Luck", and a few others. Also, I started laughing my butt off when Christopher Lloyd entered the film. "Back to the Future" is my favorite movie of all time, and Christopher Lloyd's character is one of my favorites. I didn't even know he was in this movie until I saw his name in the opening credits. But as soon as he entered, I was giggling like a maniac. Overall, if you enjoy Mel Brooks, theater, or World War II movies, definitely give this a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nazi thriller with lots of farce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Real life husband and wife Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft play husband and wife Frederick and Anna Bronski. They are performers in their own Polish theater when WWII invade. He's jealous of her flirtiness. She's tired of his bossiness. Lt. Andre Sobinski (Tim Matheson) is her secret admirer. He's a bomber pilot who escapes to Britain to keep fighting the war. Prof. Siletski (Jose Ferrer) is a double agent who is on his way back to Poland to expose the Polish resistance and Sobinski is sent back to intercept him. Col. Erhardt (Charles Durning) is the confused Nazi who takes over the Bronski home. Bronski impersonates Erhardt and then Siletski in order to stop the resistance from falling into Nazi hands.It's not the usual Mel Brooks parody. He's not writing this one but there are lots of Brooks touches. He gets to take some more swipes at the Nazis. There is a compelling thrilling drama at the center of this but Brooks is always there to poke fun at it. It's a spy caper thriller that has lots of slapstick and farce injected into it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie, But Not Typical Mel Brooks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a truly entertaining movie, but it does not have the over the top antics of a typical Mel Brooks film. One would not expect it too, since Brooks was neither the writer nor the director. It certainly has its moments and, as expected, Brooks steals the show.Of note are the touching scenes, which were clearly personal to those making the film. Specifically, all the comedy stops when the homosexual character is taken away by the Gestapo. Clearly Brooks is reminding us that despite the buffoonery being displayed, the pain that the REAL Nazis caused was no joke. This movie would be enjoyed most by fans of "classic" comedy films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Remake of the Lubitsh classic but the original is even funnier!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A "9" because I am a Mel Brooks fan. The same basic story and script as the 1942 classic, but not a scene-for-scene remake, as reported by several others. Mel Brooks and Ann Bancroft reprise the roles made famous by Jack Benny and Carole Lombard. Mel Brooks plays a "Ham" of a Jewish Polish actor just barely making a living in a little theater in Poland. ("He is doing to the theater what Hitler is doing to Poland.") His wife is even more famous than him. Several good performances by many supporting actors, most notably Christopher Lloyd as "Schultz",and his commanding officer, the bumbling Col. Erhardt (Charles Durning). Based almost entirely on the comic devise of mistaken identity, Mel gets to play the three performances of his "Polish career", as a turncoat Nazi spy, Col. Erhardt, and even Adolf Hitler! There are two cute song and dance numbers, including "Sweet Georgia Brown" in Polish! In the end, the spy is shot by Ann Bancroft's "lover", and everyone flies off to England in Hitler's airplane. Several script changes from the 1942 original include: Col. Erhardt does not shoot himself, and "Hitler" (Mel Brooks) does not parachute into Scotland. Also missing here is "Hitler" (in the Jack Benny version) ordering the Nazis to jump out of the airplane without parachutes, as the plane is overweight. More plot exposition than the original, which makes it easier to follow, but not quite as funny. Be sure to see both versions to draw your own conclusions. There is a one-line "gag" with a stagehand named "Sondheim" (Ronny Graham) just so Mel can use the line "Send in the Clowns" in the movie! I love both versions of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do all actresses have no breasts?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very funny movie, we had heartfelt laughs throughout. It's just great to see the Nazis sent up in style. If only Hollywood could manage it about the US Nazis of today! Yes, Anne Bancroft is a brilliant actress (and, of course, she has no breasts). She and Mel Brooks carry this picture off superbly and the whole production has such brio and good cheer that you can only give it an eight for sheer entertainment. I don't care who made an earlier picture (even if it's Ernst Lubitsch and Jack Benny in 1942) this is an original, and is definitely collectible (if the DVD ever comes out). We have been watching Euro art movies that paralyse you to the fingertips with boredom, and this picture lights up your life and gives you a kick in the pants like few others do. To hell with Euro art movies about bondage and lesbianism, let Mel Brooks reign supreme!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TO BE OR NOT TO BE (Alan Johnson, 1983) **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an unnecessary but not displeasing remake of Ernst Lubitsch's 1942 film, which is an undisputed classic (and one of my own all-time favorites). It turned out very faithful to the original: wisely, Brooks opted not to spoof what was already a black comedy ? this may have had something to do with his decision not to write and direct the film himself.The fast-moving plot still works beautifully, though the jokes tend to fall flat ? since they don't have the same immediacy of the wartime years, while the level of acting is far below that of the 1942 version. The remake adds sentimentality and the unfortunate inevitability of a gay stereotype; all in all, however, Brooks' earlier lampoon of Nazism in the form of the "Springtime For Hitler" set-piece in THE PRODUCERS (1968) was much more effective. There are, nonetheless, a couple of good songs here ? while the original's gem of a final gag involving Hitler has been replaced by an equally priceless one.As I said, the leads are no match for Jack Benny and Carole Lombard from the 1942 version (and are overage to boot) ? though it was certainly nice to watch real-life couple Brooks (who, unsurprisingly, gets to double as both Professor Siletsky and Hitler) and Anne Bancroft playing alongside each other for once. Still, Jose' Ferrer fills the old Stanley Ridges role more than adequately?but, then, Charles Durning makes for a poor substitute to Sig Rumann in the all-important role of Colonel "Concentration Camp" Erhardt (amazingly, Durning's rather forced performance here was nominated for an Oscar!).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Benny did a few really good films--such as THE MEANEST MAN IN THE WORLD and TO BE OR NOT TO BE. Despite that he often made fun of his film career, he was pretty good when he played something other than "Jack Benny". And, in this version of TO BE OR NOT TO BE, Mel Brooks, instead, plays the lead. And, he does a competent job. The problem is, Jack Benny did such a good job in the original, why remake the film in the first place? I would have been a lot happier if they had just re-released the original to the theaters once again. Although, I must admit that Brooks is unusually restrained and does show respect for the material.So my advice: watch this film and then see the VERY SIMILAR original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake of the classic Jack Benny-Carol Lombard film is even better than the original.Made with the comic gift of Mel Brooks, the film really shines. Where else but with Brooks would we hear the line-"My cousin Rivka got burned out?" Where else would you hear Sweet Georgia Brown sung in Polish?As famous thespians in pre-war Poland, the two are trapped with the Nazi invasion in 1939. Jose Ferrer is marvelous in the role of a professor who is really a Nazi trying to get a list of third columnists.With all this going on, the Bancroft character has been having an affair with officer Tim Matheson, who becomes part of the plot to get Ferrer before he can bring the list to Nazi headquarters.Charles Durning, as Schultz, seizes the opportunity in a completely off the wall performance as a dumb German officer. He could have easily been in "Hogan's Heroes" after this one.The escape scenes with the entire acting troop are hilariously done. A homosexual character is absolutely fabulous as he seeks refuge from the Nazi terror.There is laughter every step of the way up to Brooks dressing up like Hitler as their plane lands into an English bar and Brooks walks in saying, "Is this England?"Truly a romp and a great one at that.</fullReview>
