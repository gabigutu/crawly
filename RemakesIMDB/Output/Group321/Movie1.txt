		<shortDescription>It Could Have Been So Much More...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted this movie to be good. Really. I think Jessica Alba is an extremely talented actress, and I had high hopes for this movie. J horror remake, interesting premise, Jessica Alba...sounds good so far. But this movie left me disappointed in when I saw it last night. The movie relies on cheap thrills that aren't frightening to the mature moviegoer. I should have expected this, as it was rated PG-13, but the theatre full of screaming 11 year olds at every jump was quite irritating. When it was all over, The Eye left me wanting more. The only thinking and mystery in the movie is done for you and the "science-talk" from Alba seems unrealistic. It relies on loud noises and horror movie clichés at every turn. The Eye is a definite popcorn movie. It may be entertaining for younger viewers, but if you want a deeper and more engaging story, look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cookie cutter rip-off with unneeded changes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you watch this movie, be aware that Gin-Gwai (The Eye)came first. There have even been two sequels. The third one was called The Eye 10 as a marketing ploy by the US director. It is truly awful, so avoid it like the plague.That being said, the thing that both US influenced versions have are a total lack of creativity, suspense, or originality. It is a pity that Ms. Alba chose this role, as it was merely a shell of the original film. Every scene was reproduced in a typical US-dumbed down format, with typical cheap Friday the 13th scares thrown in. This version ironically lost sight of the original vision of the Pang Brother's classic. Instead, they change key plot elements to "add to" the suspense, IE: American audiences can't think, so we have to hold up a sign that says "SCREAM".Do yourself and others a favor and rent, or even better buy a copy of the original. You will not be disappointed. Sadly, the same cannot be said for yet another cheap, unimaginative, 80's camp pile of garbage rip-off in the mold of The Grudge, Hide and Seek, and Dark Water. Don't even waste your time downloading this tripe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Eye (2008) I knew going into the theater that this would be a bit scary. OK, maybe traumatizing. I had a LASIK procedure done a couple of years ago, and although I wasn't blind beforehand, I did have pretty bad eyesight. I know a bit about the trepidation - perhaps even outright terror - one feels before undergoing an operation on one's eyeballs. I still get a little skeeved when I see a closeup of eyes, come to think of it.Jessica Alba plays Sydney, a blind concert violinist who has a double corneal transplant, and of course things go wrong. Not with the surgery itself, but with the psychological aftermath - she sees dead people. And dead things. And undead. And so on; it looks like she's tapped into a spiritual world, or something. No one else can see what she's seeing, which is par for the course in movieland, but all of the demons and smoke and fire and other sfx seem extremely, utterly, real to Sydney.Alba is excellent, showing that she has more than just two (or three) talents to show the world. Her Sydney is appealing in her vulnerability; Alba, a beautiful young woman, manages to make you feel as if her character could, indeed, live in your world: less glitzy starlet, more three-dimensional person. Of course, she's still a knockout, and she IS a supremely talented musician, and she DOES live in a super-posh apartment in a high rise, but still. Alba shows wonderful range, from tender to fragile, without giving up any sincerity. The movie hinges on her ability to sell the audience on her character's Everywoman (to a point) status, and I think she delivers.Some of you may be thinking you've already seen this movie before, when it was called Blink. In Blink, Madeline Stowe played a young woman who lost her sight as a child (as did Sydney) and then grew up to be a talented violinist; after a new eye operation temporarily restores some sight, she sees things. Just like Sydney. Huh. Still, this isn't a redo of Blink, it's a remake of a Chinese film called Gin gwai. Asian films have made the rounds of Hollywood in recent years (The Ring, The Grudge, Dark Water), and although the remakes usually don't have the subversive bite of their original counterparts, some of them hold up rather well when inundated with high-tech CGI. The Eye does use special effects, but it uses them - pardon me - to great effect; you're not overwhelmed with attention-grabbing CGI.The biggest debit in the movie is the love interest, Sydney's doctor, Paul (Alessandro Nivola), who seems dull and unimportant, although his believing in and trusting Sydney is a linchpin for moving the plot. He just seems vacant and stiff, hardly a commendation of Nivola's acting abilities. (Think of a younger Dylan McDermott.) On the other hand, a good counterbalance to Nivola is Parker Posey as Sydney's concerned sister, who, although she doesn't immediately buy into Sydney's rantings, does empathize and attempt to understand a bit better than the hunky doctor.Overall, The Eye is a tense, shudder-filled movie that manages to dress up a recycled plot with dead-on performances and evocative cinematography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective scares and an excellent dramatic lead performance from Jessica Alba</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this era of stem cell research, where genetic re-programming results in human heart cells beating in a Petrie dish, perhaps The Eye's premise of cellular memory is not so far-fetched. Blinded during a childhood accident, gorgeous and gifted first violinist Sydney Wells (Jessica Alba) undergoes a corneal transplant. Previously confident in the dark, sweet Sydney's secure world becomes terrifying when she finds she can see not only dead people, but the prophetic visions of the former owner of her newly restored vision.Everyone around her thinks she's going mad, from her unsympathetic maestro to her concerned sister Helen (played poorly by an underused and under directed Parker Posey) to her conflicted doctor in an underwritten and choppy character arc. (Is Alessandro Nivola playing an eye doctor or a psychoanalyst? Is he a staunch professional or driven by love to cross the line?) Sydney feels compelled to decipher her visions, sensing that if she does, the troubled spirit of the original donor may finally find peace.Directorial flaws aside, The Eye's strengths lie in its superb visuals, effective scares and, above all, the impressive and convincing performance of its leading lady. Appearing in virtually every scene, Alba has you blinking tears when her eyes sting and second-guessing your own eyes when you see what she sees.A remake of the Pang Brothers 2002 Hong Kong hit Gin gwai, The Eye is actually a Hollywood rip-off, traversing the familiar territory of recent thriller Blink, 1978's Eyes of Laura Mars and even Roger Corman's 1963 horror pic X: The Man With X-Ray Eyes.The Eye has satisfying echoes of J horror plus ghost stories such as The Sixth Sense and The Others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another blinking remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With virtually every successful Asian horror movie of the last few years having already been remade by Hollywood, it was only a matter of time before Gin gwai (AKA The Eye) got the treatment, despite the original not really being all that great (I found it fairly entertaining, but unexceptional?my rating: 6/10).Jessica Alba plays Sydney Wells, a blind violinist who receives a cornea transplant only to discover that her new set of peepers allow her to see much more than she had originally bargained for: Sydney can see dead people!! Aided by her doctor, she attempts to unravel the terrible secret behind her scary supernatural power.Directed by David Moreau and Xavier Palud, The Eye is a totally unnecessary and dreary remake that copies parts of original verbatim, alters scenes that should have been left well alone (the creepy cafe meat-licking scene has gone, and the downbeat ending has been swapped for a typical Hollywood crowd pleaser), and totally botches what should be the scariest bit of the whole film (the lift scene is VERY disappointing).Take my advice: If you've already seen Gin gwai, then stay away from The Eye.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so it isn't the best horror movie ever made, but it also isn't the worst.The premise is reasonable (for a horror) and despite a few plot holes the film manages to build the suspense. Alba's acting is not exactly award winning, but she does enough to avoid you disbelieving the character.The biggest gripe I have is that the ending is a bit of an anticlimax. After the build up (I think there should have been a bit more with the apartment residents) it just fizzled out.Overall I wouldn't rush out to buy the DVD, but if there isn't anything else on, you could do worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Eye (2002) is an excellent horror film.That movie had a great atmosphere,an excellent performance from the main actress,some creepy moments which produced me some jumps and a disturbing but perfect ending.And the remake of The Eye lacks of all that important elements.If I have to summarize this movie in a few words,I would say:another crappy remake.This remakes MUST be stopped.This film does not have a good atmosphere,Jessica Alba does not show any of credibility on her role and the ''scary'' moments produced on me unintentional laughs.But,the worst element from this movie is that they changed the brilliant ending from the original film for a pathetic one.Alessandro Nivola is the only one of the cast who shows some enthusiasm and he added some points to this poor movie.Maybe,the people who did not see the original movie will appreciate the film more.But,for me,The Eye (2008) is a crappy movie with cheap thrills.Like I said before,these remakes MUST be stopped.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers in post: I was so bored. Nothing happens in this movie until the last ten minutes. You get a few random ghost sightings, but nothing happens with them at all. Most of the movie is made up of really boring scenes where nothing happens. You keep waiting for something real to happen, and it just never does. Too many nightmare shots.This movie is a lot like Sixth Sense, only nowhere near as well done. It also feels like it was trying to copy some elements from Ghost.I really couldn't wait for it to be over. It felt like just another bad remake of a Japanese film where they lost too much in the translation.Wait for it to show up on cable. You're not missing much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Monkey Theorum Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter for an infinite amount of time will eventually produce the works of Shakespeare. Coincidently, this same theory applies to the onslaught of Asian horror remakes that is stomping Hollywood into submission. If enough of these films are remade, then eventually one will be acceptable, and alas it has happened.The Eye, starring Jessica Alba is directed by two relative first timers by the names of David Moreau and Xavier Palud, and they can certainly create a film that boasts certain elements of stylish direction. Unfortunately, along with the good, it seems that all of this style of remake fear deviation from a backbone template. Not to give anything away to those who are not familiar with Asian horror remakes, but one element that is consistent is that the basis of all the evil happenings is from a spirit looking for salvation of some sort. While The Eye, does choose to spin this cliché slightly, it is afraid to go all the way.Suffering from total blindness after a childhood accident, young beauty Sydney Wells (Alba) is given a chance at an eye transplant that will allow her to see for the first time in decades. Not surprisingly, she begins to see things that ought not to be. Aided by an appointed shrink, played by Alessandro Nivola, they confront the visions and try to track the donor eyes back to their sinister source. This journey is bounds more intelligent then the average horror story, and the standard for dumb decisions is cleverly hidden by the fact that Sydney is fully or partially blind for most of the film. This presents a cushion of forgives per se, as her lack of sight can lead her into frightening situations, without appearing ignorant.And there are certainly some frightening "boo" moments; uniquely accentuated by a well used pallet of sound. There are also exactly three expertly executed scenes, worthy of recognition. The first is a scene in which a blurry eyed Sydney looks into the mirror for the first time with creepy consequences; the second features a member of the un-dead accompanying her in an elevator and the third takes the form of an intervention between a mother who has recently lost her son. If The Eye had presented more scenes of this Claiborne, it certainly could have been something special. Instead, the ending descends into the mediocrity, which at first seemed more then acceptable, but took off into a sixth sense meets final destination action spin off; which although still thrilling, did not fit the tone and atmosphere of the former acts. The "blurry vision" that is used early on with some skill, is overused by the end, the flashbacks replace the more effective quick cutbacks and it simply does not hold onto its success.This is however Alba's best performance, and although not saying much, this shows there is hope for her future acting career. While more films like The Eye would be welcome, I think it better to forfeit the Asian remakes all together, then to wait for the monkey's second draft.Read all my reviews at: http://www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Eye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I haven't watched the original Eye movie by the Pang Brothers, but I guess with remakes these days, it doesn't really matter, since most of the time, the Hollywood remade version pales in comparison with the original, despite having a bigger budget, bigger stars and of course, better visual effects. And what almost always seem woeful, is the attempt to try and recreate the atmospherics for a spook fest that Asian horror had perfected, and I'm inclined to suggest that they should adapt the storyline (since there's a creative dearth of ideas), but leave the mimicking of mood at the door.This is probably the first movie that Jessica Alba marquees, and comparisons would be abound for those who've watched the original to compare her to Angelica Lee's performance. But really, I don't think it matters, since all you need to do is to look scared. As blind violinist Sydney, Alba escapes the need to act blind given the cop out of using shades, coupled with the fact that her transplanted eyes allow for the camera to be out of focus for the most parts.Things start to get interesting when she begins to see shadowy figures borrowed straight out of Pulse (yet another Asian horror remake), and these all get conveniently debunked by her doctor Paul (Alessandro Nivola who stars as the hopeless, formless Gavin Harris in the Goal movies), because if you're blind for so many years, your brain needs some major time out to absorb all the new sights you're constantly bombarded with. So goes as with standard horror fare, that those who can see spirits when others can't, are classified as nutcases. Alba's no scream queen as the proceedings don't allow her to exercise her lungs, and I swear there are just too many of those waking up from nightmare moments, and the clock ticking around 1:05am.But credit is due though to the scenes which aim to frighten, and some did hit the mark even though they're the usual tools to surprise from the bag of Boo tricks. There are, to me, a major unexpected moment which I had to nod in acknowledgement of not seeing it coming (I had thought otherwise), but unfortunately, that was it. The latter half of the journey became a road trip movie which seeked answers, coupled with Hollywood's preoccupation of having to explain and show everything, leaving little to your imagination since everything was spelt out. While the story's not at fault, the way it's presented made this look like a standard mystery thriller, without the mystery, and without the thrills.And the finale was a little lacklustre as it seemed to be styled in Final Destination fashion, making it look like it had no more rabbits to pull out of the hat. The Eye had plenty of neat visual effects, and although there are some beautiful stunts involving glass shards and the walking through of objects, special effects alone do not make a horror movie spine-chilling. Looks like there's some major sty in this eye.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Eye was not a great movie but it's not horrible either. It was about an average movie. I was not expecting a lot going into seeing this movie. If you are expecting a lot going into this movie it will not be good but if your just looking to see a movie and thinking its going to be good you might actually like it. Pretty much the whole entire beginning and almost all of the middle was boring and just had very sudden scenes that would get you to jump out of your seat. The rest of the movie was when it started to kick up and get good. Jessica Alba finally started to find out what she had to do and what was going on with her and people around her. Thats when the action started and it had you on the edge of your seat. For the most part it was pretty slow moving and boring but then it kicked up it was good. If the first hour of the movie was like the end it would have of been an excellent movie. So if your looking for a pretty scary movie with lots of things that pop out at you go see this. The story was actually pretty good as well. The fact that it made you wait to find out why she became blind was well done. The acting job Jessica Alba did was good as well. The visual effects for this movie were also awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"These Are Not My Eyes." -- Slightly Better Than Most Would Expect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Eye" is a supernatural horror/thriller about Sydney Wells (Jessica Alba), an accomplished violinist who lost her sight at the age of five. But with advanced medical technology, Sydney is able to undergo a corneal transplant procedure, which would restore her vision. After the surgery though, the fact that Syndey can see the world around her doesn't matter to her anymore, because along with it she is seeing ghostly visions and witnessing horrific events from the past and the future. It begins to seem that Sydney is taking on the traits of the donor of the eyes, and she must uncover her identity to stop the visions and put the donor's spirit to rest.While I haven't seen the original Chinese version, I can say this was a decent horror flick. It's a PG-13 horror flick, yes, but it's rather sophisticated for being so. Most films in this type of league have reputations for being not-so-great (a couple of examples that I can agree with would be last year's "The Messengers", and this year's "One Missed Call", both being films that completely missed the mark). But this was better than a lot of the PG-13 thrillers that are out there, and it is easy to see there was some solid thought and work put into it. The story, while it is a remake, is intriguing. The entire idea of an eye transplant is a scary thing to begin with, and the supernatural element carried along with it is clever. I really thought the pacing in the film was great, it evened itself out when handling the suspense and scares with the dramatic elements and was gradual up until the end.There is some really great creepy imagery as well and some neat cinematography, and that's where most of this movie's strength is. There are some genuinely eerie visuals in this movie, most of them unlike any I've seen before, and there are some clever shocks and scares as well. I even have to admit that I jumped a couple of times and was slightly spooked, so I have to applaud the direction because they did a good job with that. I also immensely enjoyed the sequences where we get to see through the lead character's eyes, blurry vision and all, which was a neat way to put the audience in her shoes as her life spirals out of control after the procedure. I'm really squeamish when it comes to anything involving someone's eyes too, as many people are I'm sure, so a few moments did get my skin crawling.I'm not going to lie, this movie does have some standard clichés but manages to be at least halfway original in some aspects. The acting is decent, nothing remarkable but Jessica Alba makes a likable lead here. Parker Posey is good too as her older sister, although her part is pretty small. Alessandro Nivola plays the role of the doctor who initially doesn't believe anything the Alba character is saying, a role we know too well, but does what he can with it. Also notable is Chloe Moretz of "The Amityville Horror" remake, playing a young cancer patient. The action-laced ending was a little flat if you ask me, and the revelation of the ghost's discontentment was well-thought out but also a little flat. I'm not going to harp on it though, because I felt there was sufficient effort put into this, and I for the most part enjoyed most of the movie.Overall, in my eyes (pun intended), "The Eye" is a decent horror movie. It's not perfect by any means, but I can say it's better than most of the PG-13 horror flicks that have hit theaters in recent years. All in all it's a bit above average, and worth seeing if you like this sort of thing. It serves a few good scares and some interesting ideas, managing to be halfway refreshing compared to most horror films lately. I'd also like to add that this was far better than the atrocious remake of the Japanese horror movie, "One Missed Call", which was released about a month before this. So, if you were put off by that mess of a movie, I'd say give this one a chance, it might surprise you. It did me, anyway. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie but NOT for horror fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're looking for a pulse-pounding horror thriller, you won't find that here. If you're looking for a spooky ghost story, you might want to move on. If you're looking for blood &amp; guts &amp; body parts, don't even waste a minute of your time."The Eye" isn't so much a horror flick as it is a supernatural drama.This film is a remake of the 2002 Chinese "The Eye" which I haven't seen, so I can't (and probably shouldn't) compare the two. I thought this was a nicely done film, more of an intimate character study than a scary "gotcha" flick. In that respect it's similar to "The Sixth Sense", and not just the story. Like "The Sixth Sense" which was a slow moving psychological drama that just happened to have dead people in it, "The Eye" takes a personal approach as well. And while that may bore the audience members who are expecting some screams, it ultimately results in a film with a little bit more to say than your average screamer.Jessica Alba ("Sydney") does a great job of playing a woman who has been blind since age 5, a loner, someone who doesn't seem to have many connections with people and she likes it that way. The underlying theme is that her blindness makes her feel unique, exempt from the real world. When she regains her sight after 15 years by a corneal transplant, it's not necessarily the wonderful experience you'd expect. There's a scene when she comes back from the hospital to a surprise party, and the scene is filmed with unsettling, distorted closeups of strange faces. It perfectly expresses the confusion and claustrophobia of not just a blind person gaining her sight, but that of an introvert being forced into society. That enough could've been enough for a feature length film: how a woman deals with the "gift" of sight which she doesn't really want. But it doesn't end there. She starts seeing dead people, too.While we never really feel like Sydney is in any deadly peril, there are a few very effective surprises which, I gotta admit, quickened my pulse a few notches. Also the "shadow men" were very creepy, and if you want to see a real shocker, check out the bonus features where we learn that the shadow men are not cgi graphics, but it's an actual dude... a sort of living skeleton who looks just as bizarre in real life than on screen.The 2nd half of the film becomes a mystery as Sydney tries to figure out why she's getting these disturbing visions and what she's supposed to do about it. Again, no hair raising car chases or shootouts here, just a thick atmosphere of the unknown.Like I said, I haven't seen the original Chinese film, but I can tell that the American filmmakers were trying to add a degree of backstory. In the bonus features they talk about the science of "cellular memory" (the idea that donated organs possess characteristics that are imparted to the new recipient). So I can assume that this is less of a visceral shocker (like the original?) as it is an intellectual approach. There's also the psychology bit I mentioned above. And it also touches on the idea that artists, musicians &amp; creative thinkers are more sensitive to supernatural events (Sydney is a concert violinist). In short, "The Eye" sacrifices the raw approach of a typical action-horror flick, and instead replaces it with more of a slow-moving, scientific or "rational" approach to the supernatural.Depending on your preference, that's a good or bad thing. I can go either way depending on my mood; once in a while I like to think, whereas other times I just want to see Freddy slice some people to ribbons. "The Eye" definitely falls on the thinking side of that scale. Other thinking horror flicks I recommend are "Exorcist III" (one of the BEST), "The Others" with Nicole Kidman, and of course "The Sixth Sense".</fullReview>

Jessica Alba should be more careful in choosing her roles because i do believe that she has talent and can be a great actress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh uh. On one side there is very un-imaginative copy of above-average Asian horror move. I would not say the original is great, but it is watchable and above average. This copy - wreck is behind the visuals (it is actually significantly less frightening than the original), some scenes have been softened so they are easier to understand for Westerners (the scene from Asian bistro where in the original you may see the really chilling ghost of the owners wife, now we do have just some generic fire or something), only a few scenes have been improved (burned man in the lift). But, there are significant changes that distort the movie: The "shadows" are NEUTRAL in the original (they are guides to souls and they do not care about the heroine), now they are SCARY, because "they do not want to be seen". Worst of all, the movie is totally wrecked at the end: Poor, pathetic Americans could not possibly go sleep without some sort of happy-end so Jessica Alba SAVES people at the end. In the original NO ONE IS SAVED. The heavy mood of original is based on idea "even if you see the future, you'll change nothing" aka Cassandra complex (do you remember Twelve Monkeys, anyone?). In the copy - wreck we have some blah blah about "ghost which doesn't want to be saved, he wants to save me and people". Such tragedy, such destruction! Let's convert any movie to happy movie! Let's convert all tragedies into comedies! I'm so disgusted.</fullReview>

In the Chinese version, the premise of the story makes sense, because they do some truly shady things with Organ transplants. The concept that they would import an unvetted transplant tissue from Mexico to the US defies credulity.Anyway, Jessica Alba plays a blind violinist, who is given a retinal transplant, and starts seeing dead people. Everyone thinks she crazy. The movie drags on interminally. (I had to stop it about six times because it was moving too slow, and start doing other tasks. I pity anyone who sat through the whole thing in a theater.) It's not really worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another rip-off of an Asian movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2002, The Eye was released in Japan. Now this movie was different, but it was an OK movie. In 2008 US released The Eye and changed it a little bit. But, the outcome was horrible. Jessica Alba was an OK lead. She did a fair job on acting and pretending to be scared. But, the graphics. The "demons" that lead people to death were just horrible looking. My opinion is that the Eye wasn't anything special, just another cheesy and stupid horror movie that 14-year-olds waste 10 dollars on. Just watch it on show time for free. It was just one of those horror movies that where everyone dies except for the main character. It also had some nonsense in it like a little dead boy walking around asking "Have you seen my report card?" The script was decent. But, honestly the movie was just nothing special. Think of it as "The Grudge" without little children constantly meowing and having body parts dislocated in an elevator.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The biggest problem with "The Eye" is not that it is a remake of one of the most insipid and dull Hong Kong supernatural thrillers ever made, "Gin Gwai", but that it isn't any improvement over the original either.The consensus appears to be that this film is just boring. Boring isn't a strong enough word to describe it though. It's tedious, dragged out, and makes you want to stab yourself with a fork to stay awake for the 97 minutes running time just in case anything happens at all.I watched the original a few years ago and didn't really like it so I was hoping that there was going to be some new angle to this. Unfortunately, apart from changing the locations, the names of the characters and a few subtle plot differences, it was actually worse.I can't blame the actors for this one. Jessica Alba is alright to look at and there is no doubt that she can act and look worried really well. The story here was just so thin and the dialogue was so bad that nobody could have made any more of it. Alessando Nivola however plays such an unconvincing doctor that I would actually dread to have someone like him involved in any post-surgical recovery process in real life. Shouting at your patients and telling them that they are wrong a couple of days after they've had cornea transplants is not a good bedside manner! There were a couple of moments where I thought that things would pick up. A jump scare involving an oven fell flat though and the others disintegrated into horrible messes of CGI. There was no tension, no suspense, just no atmosphere whatsoever. It could have been a daytime TV show about boiled eggs for all the emotional impact it had.The ending was just like a deleted scene from "Final Destination". The whole movie is supposed to build up to this final act as an explanation of why Sydney Wells is seeing things in the first place but it just felt tagged on and was very rushed. It didn't really make any difference though because I'd already written this whole film off after the first ten minutes anyway.I'm not sure if anyone would like this film. It's not going to appeal to fans of the original and for older horror fans it's just like a very bad version of "Eye" from "John Carpenter's Body Bags" (1993). It's very dated and that's a terrible thing for a new film to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so bad, but not the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Eye isn't necessarily a "bad" movie. It's not necessarily a "great" movie, either. But it is good, and there are moments that are scary enough to drown you in the moment, or cover your eyes in fear of what's going to happen.Most complaints come in declaring Alba wasn't up to snuff with this film. Unfortunately there seems to be a stigma attached to attractive actresses that declares them unable to act regardless of any progress they make.Alba's performance was fairly strong, and convincing at most times. Especially during the segments where being "blind" comes under scrutiny. She wore the "blind but not blind" jacket well. Scenes such as the first hospital hallway scare and later in the film looking at herself in the mirror asking for answers, she conveys honest anxiety and projects the urgency &amp; high stress of a situation like that well.Nivola's performance, in my opinion, is what lacked in this film. His role was large enough to make his lack-luster performance detract from the film. You never feel that he's connected to the situation(s) in the movie, and his personality always seems "forced" consistently throughout the film.All in all, a good watch, worth taking the time to see if you like horror movies in general. Quite a bit of "shock" horror is used, with occasional golden nuggets of honest horror (elevator scenes come to mind). Give it a chance if you've any interest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't hate her because she's beautiful. Jessica Alba is about the only thing redeemable out of this mess. This remake of a Hong Kong thriller just didn't seem to make the transition...to me. Very dark, brooding and an anxiety builder. Sydney Wells(Alba)is a young concert violinist that has been sightless since a childhood tragedy. She gets the cornea transplant she has waited for and will have to learn to see again. Shortly after, blurry images start to haunt her. Is she having trouble adjusting or is her imagination working overtime? Could it just be that her new eyes have in reality opened her to a nightmarish world that only she can see. Apparently the anonymous eye donor did not intend to give up the ghost. Yes, Alba can act when given the chance. She just wasn't really given much to work with this time. Other players: Parker Posey, Alessandro Nivola, Obba Babatunde, Rachel Ticton and Chloe Moretz.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why, oh why, the eye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I've come to the conclusion remakes suck. The ring introduced this phenomenon and now, we as a collective group, should boycott remakes. They just had to get their fingers in the eye's cookie jar. To its credit, the destruction of this movie is not what I thought it would be. I thought Jessica Alba would ruin it for me. Turns out, the writers and director are the ones who need to be slapped. Horrible, HORRIBLE dialogue. I don't know the name of the actor who plays the doctor in the movie, but wow. He really tapped into some crazy horrible over acting. Then, scenes which scarred me for life in the original ( and I am basing this as a fan of the original ) held nothing but disdain in this one. Alba's dreams suddenly become premonitions, and it destroys the whole point of the original donor being cursed with premonitions via sight. Sadly, I did not make it through this movie. Why bother? You know, I wish they would domestically release these movies in theaters, THE ORIGINALS, but we are a society that is anti-subtitle, so we are stuck in re-make hell. I heard this movie tanked at the box office. If things continue, maybe we can escape this sh*tty trend, just marginally scarred.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young woman blind since the age of five, receives an eye transplant &amp; soon thereafter, she's haunted by terrifying visions &amp; sees ghosts everywhere, with the help of a friend, she attempts to find out who her donor was &amp; discovers a horrifying story surrounding her death. THE EYE is yet another attempt by Hollywood to remake a really creepy foreign film from the orient &amp; just like others they remade (THE RING &amp; THE GRUDGE etc.) this too falls flat on it's face. Now granted this film is much better than those I mentioned, however it still falls short of it's true potential, while there are a few scares on hand &amp; some creepy idea's, the film just fails to hold together despite the strong acting &amp; directing. In fact this is another example that further proves the old saying that "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" is right after all. Not the worst film of it's kind, but still nothing to brag about, see the original version instead.** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised by how closely the movie followed the original despite a few changes that weren't a big deal. For an hour and 20 minutes I was excited by how well they did cause we all know how Americans ruin foreign horror.Then in the last 10 minutes, they ruined the movie for me. The ending was weak and not every emotional. They tried to make a happy ending and it took all the feeling out of the movie. The original ending is soo much better and you really feel a sense of shock and say "I can't believe that happened" which is what Asian horror is about.How the makers of this movie followed it so closely for over an hour and ruined the ending is amazing. That takes some real effort. Overall still a decent horror but it could have been so much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wish I was blind so I wouldn't have seen this awful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see "The Eye" with no reservations in my mind. I had only seen a couple of trailers and thought it looked good, but didn't do any research prior to going. Now I wish that I had.What is so bad about this movie? For starters, the plot was practically nonexistent and could be described in a sentence or less. I won't share that sentence because I don't want to put a spoiler in here. The entire film was less-than-inspired, with each scene bland and pointless.As for the 'scary' aspect of the film, it tried hard to make the audience jump every ten minutes or so with the standard cheap thrill of a completely quiet scene interrupted with a loud scream or other sound. There were a number of gory images, but they were presented in short clips, with ten or twenty images in about a second. I suppose that was supposed to be scary, but it really served to break up the otherwise dull plot.One of the biggest disappointments with "The Eye" is the filming. Half the film is intentionally out of focus, another quarter is filmed by someone running with a camera (read: jumpy and nausea-inducing), and the rest was standard filming with a couple special effects.So, all-in-all, unless you crave a film that inspires migraines, avoid "The Eye."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First am going to admit I didn't watch the original. Am not a guy that likes to watch foreign films, so I will spare you with any comparison. The movie at the beginning moves sort of slow. They do put some parts that are meant to scare the viewer, but they did seem contrived and really didn't scare me. But as the movie plot thickens, the movie starts having a real story, and it does entertain the viewer, not just a gimmick of spooky special effects, with absolutely no plot. I would give this movie a 6.5. It turns very solid towards the end.I do agree it could be a little bit tedious at the beginning, but if you are a guy that has the patience, towards the end, it picks up well. Not the scariest movie ever though, but in the end, it did deliver. I've seen way worse, and I think some are being somewhat to harsh.Solid move, a 6.5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Giving this movie a 6</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was a good movie, it was more of a thriller to me. It makes me want to see the original. Jessica Alba was great, and her eyes looked really wild. Giving this movie a 6, putting it above average, yet not as good as some of the old school thrillers. I got a little lost at one point in the movie, and did not understand why the girl whom the eyes belong to seen these things. The movie put a question in my head, I wonder if something like this is possible? Can a dead person's organ's still have their five senses attached and pass them on. The movie also reminded me of Gothika, I like movies that give you the idea that the dead could come back to finish their unfinished business. This was a little different, this girls eyes were special, yet caused her a lot of grief. I would not pay to see the movie again in theater, however I would buy the movie just to watch on a cold winter's night at home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of horror in any way but my friend really wanted to see The Eye and I went with him to see it. I do like Japanese horror and seeing as The Eye was a remake of a Chinese film I hoped to enjoy it (if that makes any sense). I hadn't seen the original but my friend gave me a summary of the original so I knew what to expect.So I can easily say I loved it. It was well done and kept me interested the whole way through. The film effects were very believable (I won't reveal what they were for those who don't know the plot) and the story was a good one. I think if you're looking for a horror movie with a ton of blood this is definitely not the one to see. It's not a movie with a serial killer who kills everyone off. But if you're into supernatural thrillers then this is definitely what you're looking for. A little bit of mystery with the right effects to still make you jump.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A review by someone who hasn't seen the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since everyone who has seen this movie has seen the original (and upon reading the reviews here in IMDb I can safely say, everyone), I on the other hand haven't. Why you ask? I'm just tired of Asian Horror, it's always more of the same. After viewing this awfully boring remake, all I can say is that I will go to the local video store and rent the Pang Brothers version, and since this is a half-assed remake, I doubt that they changed anything from the original story, which was the only thing that kept me from feeding this pile of dung a lower score.So, David Moreau and Xavier Palud decided to go mainstream huh?. It seems talented directors have to go and make movies in Hollywood nowadays, its sort of becoming a routine. Oliver Hirschbiegel did Downfall, which is a masterpiece, and then he went on to direct The Invasion, which was an incredibly mediocre update to a classic. Eric Vallete directed Malefique, one of the best horror films to ever come out of France, and then he went on to direct a remake of Takashi Miike's crappy One Missed Call, which had an even worse result. Hell, even Hideo Nakata remade his own sequel to the Ring, which was horrible, so the list goes on and on.If this is Jessica Alba's best performance, then I don't want to see her worst. Horrendous acting, beating even Ben Affleck for the prestigious "Worst representation of a blind person captured on screen" award. She delivers her lines so infuriatingly bad, that I wanted to gouge my eyes out (She wasn't even in a bikini for crying out loud). Get this through your head Jessica Alba fans: She gets hired because of her looks, not her acting. The supporting cast was laughable, Parker Posey as Jessica's sister? Horrendous casting decisions.Now, the only thing scary in this movie was Alba's performance and nothing else. The cheap scares in this one get old, very quick. A mysterious man with his back turned against a wall? Haven't seen that one before. A ghost disappears, then suddenly he jumps at you out of nowhere with the requisite loud sound effect? That is original indeed. Creepy looking Asian kid? Haha c'mon writers, you can do better than this. At least do a creepy looking Brazilian kid or Puerto Rican kid or a black kid, something we haven't seen for once. I know this is an Asian remake, but please, think for a change, with the writers strike going on, anyone would think that you writers had some free time to make up original ideas, not the same cliché that we see each and every year over and over and over and over...and over AGAIN! Overall: Do not waste your time on this. This passes as Horror? It isn't even scary. It's not even a passable remake, it is just a bad one. You'll get bored by seeing the same empty hallways, the same cheap scares, the same bland performances, the sameness of it all really. Waste your time on something else. A 2/10, avoid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like horror movies with good stories, and this one has very interesting one. If you would have someone's eyes would you see differently ? Would you see things that other person saw before she dyed? Jessica Alba plays blind woman who had an eye surgery, she gets an implanted eyes from unknown donor - Mexican woman who has done the suicide. Now she sees all the great things in the world that she could only imagine but also disturbing images that she can't say if they are real or not. The scenes from someone's life.Jessica's acting is very real, makes you think how would you feel in her skin. The whole movie makes you questioning is the connection between mind and organs really possible, and do we all have the same perspective on things. The story is well ended too, nothing is left unexplained, the story comes full circle.I really enjoyed watching this movie several times, and every time makes the effect on me. My boyfriend who is not much into horror movies, liked it as well.</fullReview>

I judge things in their own right and I found this to be a very entertaining horror-thriller with a few scenes that really moved me. Alba was very good as the blind violinist thinking she's losing her mind when she starts seeing unusual things with her new-found sight, the director kept the suspense building nicely and the pivotal mirror scene was both shocking and powerful. I didn't see any "cheap thrills" here which is what some here alluded to, there was no expense spared at the end when Sydney finds out her true purpose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well worth a watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always been into horror films, but when I was 12 years old I saw A Nightmare on Elm Street, since then no horror has ever lived up to standard, and horror's in general always, always disappoint, so far as they barely make me jump at all and in the case of teen horror's, are just plain boring.When I was convinced to watch The Eye I was very sceptical, Japanese remakes often are the biggest let downs of all, usually trying to cover up how bad they are with huge special effects. However, The Eye, while far from perfect, has managed to do something that no horror has been able to do for years, it scared me. Not completely, but enough to make me jump out my seat and make my heart pound. The story is very clever, engaging and intriguing throughout, though if you're looking for a horror with lots of action then look elsewhere.Jessica Alba's performance does help to carry the film when it might have fallen down, the effects aren't trying to dominate the story and there is some brilliant tension, in fact so much so, at times I wanted something to happen so I could burst, the scene in the lift is a particularly good example of serious tension, partly because of the mystery of what might happen, but also the tension of what might happen to the character, who you do develop a connection to, you don't want her to die, a trick Hollywood horrors often miss in my opinion.Verdict: Not perfect, no where near in fact, but so much better than the usual rubbish Hollywood knocks out and well worth a watch, word of warning though, if you're looking for action and all out violence, don't bother.</fullReview>

Other horror movies would be a ghost or someone trying to kill people for no reason.. the movie would be nice but wouldn't make any sense.

		<shortDescription>Another Failed Asian Horror Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First if you haven't seen the original 2002 The Eye written and directed by the Pang Brothers then you need to. It is an essential horror film. Hollywood does this time and time again. Hollywood Finds a wonderful original idea whether it is a film from the past or from oversees and completely screws it up. This isn't a situation where someone reads the book and believes the book is better than the movie. This is a situation where an original film was dumb down, explained, changed for the purpose of marketing it to a teen or early 20's audience.From the very beginning directors Moreau and Palud failed to create appropriate atmosphere. Creating atmosphere sets the mood, interest, and attention level of the audience. If this is done incorrectly then a thin line is created between the viewer and the film. Jessica Alba's character was one of the many flawed aspects that did not create the emotional attachment. Her acting ability is very limited. The Doctor played by Alessandro Nivola was taken in the wrong direction. His hard love did not work at all. I hate to keep going back to the original but the doctor patient relationship was much more believable. My scare level, involvement, and interest were all there during the original but not for this remake. And again mood and atmosphere was the devastating factor causing a point of failure for this film. It felt more like a Drama then Horror. If you want to see a great American remake of Asian horror check out The Grudge but skip The Eye remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would be hard to describe this one as scary, but it definitely had some eerie moments and scenes and overall was entertaining. While I'm pretty skeptical about the underlying concept, i.e. "cellular memory", there are clearly a number of adherents and it's worth popping the keywords into a search engine -- like Alba did in the movie -- to better understand the underpinnings of the film.Overall I thought The Eye was well acted by both leads, as well as the supporting cast. Alba and Nivola carried the plot by encouraging us to suspend disbelief at some of the less credible incidents. The scenes of Alba playing violin featured superb talent on the part of the orchestra, both musically and visually and helped anchor the film at both ends.The one real drawback was that it was slow at times, and a little boring. But it was too intriguing to abandon before the end, where the pieces were neatly tied together.Overall worth watching and mildly thought provoking.</fullReview>

But after just recently watching this film i must say it doesn't deserve all the criticism i have read in reviews about it.The story is pretty good but was limited to what could be done with it due to the story itself. Also after reading some reviews on how horrible the acting was, I have to disagree, I think apart from the odd one or two scenes the acting was good enough. What i think could be done better though, are the parts that try to frighten the audience. Admittedly i jumped at one scene, but to be fair it depends on what people find frightening. However i don't really know myself how to make these "Fright Scenes" more scary.The ending was rather decent as well although in my thoughts was slightly predicted after seeing to many movies with ghosts or what ever you want to call them.Overall i think this movie was pretty good and doesn't deserve all the criticism I have read in other reviews, but like i said i haven't seen the original so i cant compare. The acting wasn't horrible like some reviews make it sound but other people are entitled to their opinions.For me 7/10 or 6 at the lowest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original version of the eye was really great, I enjoyed it allot. Then again so was this movie. It wasn't as good and had allot of negatives but anyways let me put it simply. THE GOOD: Very scary film, suspenseful. The sound mixing was awesome, like the scene in the Chinese restaurant, love the sound effects there. Good creepy imagery from the ghosts in this movie, I also loved what death looked like in this film. It really was an honest remake and I feel it did it's best. THE BAD: I would have kept somethings from the original movie in if I was the director, like that scene were there's a man standing in the freeway as if it were a sidewalk. Jessica Alba was alright but I would have gone with someone like Naomi Watts or Kate Hudson. The ending could have been done better. I would have picked some different locations for this movie, LA and Mexico just didn't feel right. All in all this is a watchable movie, just not buy-able.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sydney Walls (Jessica Alba) has been blind by the age of five. Since that unexpected incident, she still lived a good life and also playing the violin quite well in a group orchestra. When she's getting her eye sight back after years being blind. At first, she has a tough time seeing things and especially gets blurry to her see. But after a few days later... she starts seeing things that are not supposed to be there like the rooms would be changing, quick flashes of disturbing images and people are not what they seemed to be. At first, her doctor (Alessandro Nivola) and not even her own sister Helen (Parkey Posey) would believe her. Sydney slowly realized that she could see the presence of the supernatural that exist in the real-life, thanks to her new set of eyes. Now Sydney tries to find out, who was the person's eyes she has now and what does it want before it's too late.Directed by David Moreau and Xavier Palud (Ils) made an modestly entertainment supernatural thriller with a few elements of horror. Alba is actually quite good in the lead, she gives an better performance than i would expect from her. But the screenplay by Sebastian Gutierrez (The Big Bounce "2004", Gothika, Snakes on a Plane) has one thing that truly never delivers in his script, it's not even scary or creepy sadly. Although i never seen the original 2002 Hong Kong film of the same name. I am sure, the 2002 version is much better. For many Hollywood remakes these days, i tried to watch the originals first before seeing the hit or miss Hollywood remakes. Which it is very rare, a Hollywood remake would be just as good or even better than the original.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (also in Full Screen) and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Originally, this movie was supposed to be come out last year in the fall but Lions Gate change the schedule for a early winter 2008 release. They felt the movie needed some major re-shoots. Which the filmmakers Moreay and Palud didn't felt it was necessary. Editor of the movie Patrick Lussier (Who's best known for editing some of the better Wes Craven films and Lussier also directed films like "Dracula 2000" and the two direct to videos features) actually did the re-shoots himself and this version was probably more toned down than the filmmakers originally intended.Gutierrez's script is certainly nothing new, since it reminded me of "Blink" and even "Gothika", a script that Gutierrez's wrote. The picture does has some interesting moments at times but the script is predictable and you could see the climax coming before the movie ends. You wish, the movie ends in a more satisfying disturbing note but it never happens. It is probably why Moreau and Palud disowned the final cut of their first Hollywood production. The happy ending seems out of place with the rest of the feature. Overall, it is worth seeing for Alba's role and her fans will liked this movie even more than others. Fans of supernatural thriller will be somewhat disappointed with this picture. Watchable but nothing memorable. Also available in a Two Disc Set. Super 35. (***/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a remake worth watching!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sydney Wells plays violin with an orchestra. She is also blind. After an operation to restore her sight, she begins seeing things. Are they after effects of the operation, or is something else going on....If anyone has read the reviews I post on the IMDb, they will know I'm pretty scathing on the trend for remaking horror movies. I wish that Hollywood would try and make something new, instead of either remaking old or foreign movies. The fact that the vast majority of the remakes aren't that good certainly doesn't help.The Eye is a remake of a Korean movie, which I saw a few years back, but only vaguely remember. And while there are faults with this remake, I have to admit it's not bad.Jessica Alba as Sydney gives, I think anyway, her best performance in a movie so far. She has to carry the whole movie, and if she's not convincing, then the movie will fall apart. But she holds the movie well, and convinces not only as a blind woman, but also a violinist. And when the creepy events start happening, she conveys the terror required well.As for the rest of the cast, only Alessandro Nivola as a doctor trying to help her really registers. The rest only have small parts to play in the story.The direction by David Moreau &amp; Xavier Palud is good, and they actually pull of some scary moments. The script, written by Sebastian Gutierrez is okay, and from what I remember of the original it's a good adaption.It's not a movie that will be remembered as a great horror tale, but despite my reservations about it being YET another remake I did enjoy it for it's running time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical remake...it stunk!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Spoiler Warning***Having owned the Chinese version of The Eye, I wanted to see the American remake of the film--and compare it to the original, and the remake delivered as I expected...a total disappointment!! Some scenes, however, stayed close enough to it's original predecessor, but the scares were just plain cheap. Having loved the "why are you sitting in my chair" scene in the Chinese version as Wong Kar Mun was learning calligraphy, I could not wait to see what they did on this one; the scene took place in a crowded restaurant! I couldn't realize that the woman standing in front of Sydney Wells was a ghost until she looked around to realize nobody else acknowledged this apparition...and the scare was a total cheap spoof!! The ghost in the Chinese version comes towards Wong Kar a bit slower, but her appearance makes her creepier--that was scary...the loud track in it adds the kick to chill my spine every time I watch that scene.Moreover, the death of Ying Ying was saddening for Wong Kar since she had a good friendship with the little girl, and it made the drama great, plus it helped in convincing Dr. Lo to believe his nephew's claim that Wong Kar could see ghosts. The scene with Sydney Wells having seen Alicia Millstone walk away with a demon(yes, I called it demon) out through the door was just quick and cold--almost insignificant; as if she didn't even care! I'm surprised Alicia didn't just tell Sydney "see you later, alligator" on her way out!! I could not tell whether she was dreaming or if she actually got up. either!! All I could do to this point was just roll my eyes and almost shout curses at the movie screen with disappointment; but I wanted to see how the ending sequence was executed in the remake.Of course, Sydney and her new boyfriend/doctor saved everybody from the exploding truck--as far as the story went...everybody lived--and cost Sydney her new sight. Wow...I'm surprised Dr. Faulkner and Sydney didn't get on a white horse and rode into the sunset!! In the original version, however, Wong Kar Mun attempted in vain to get everybody out of their cars--they all saw her as if she was insane; and by ignoring her warning, it cost everyone of them their lives as the fuel tanker holding up the traffic exploded--geez, even the rat in the sewers got fried...and Wong Kar Mun was blinded by the flying debris once again.Overall, the Chinese version proved much more superb by a mile ahead--but that is my opinion, nonetheless. Of course, many viewers have a big problem with reading subtitles; they prefer a dubbed movie over a subbed any day of the week, and remakes at times are the best substitute as far as they think. However, if the remakes continually become one disappointment after another just like this one, please just stop doing them overall. As the phrase goes: "If it ain't broke, don't fix it!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good God, this movie was awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen the Asian version; for all I know it's a masterpiece, but if the plot was similar to what I just saw, then I'm afraid the writers were morons. To be fair there are a couple of very creepy scenes: one is when Alba is first getting her bandages removed and all she sees are blurry figures, including one more figure than the number of people in the room; the other scene involves a mirror (I won't spoil it). But these are the only scenes that actually have anything to do with the premise. Not only does she see ghosts and spirits, they also talk to her. Hello, filmmakers, I thought this movie was about an eye? Is she hearing things through her eye? Some coherency please? She also has full-on hallucinations that leave her bruised, because I guess whoever wrote this movie does not know about the five senses and thinks every possible stimulus a person can experience is somehow connected to their eyes. They should have just called this movie "A Bunch of Crazy S##t Happens to Jessica Alba," because The Eye factors into about 10% of it. Mainly Alba just goes around doing stupid things, like smashing all her light bulbs instead of turning off the switch or playing the violin as if she is an actual blind person who does not know what she is holding. Finally she saves the day by getting everyone off a bus in the middle of the desert by convincing them that terrorists have planted a bomb under it, which is sad because it's actually plausible (that people would believe it, I mean). Yeah, basically there are people who think this is a legitimately good movie, and they just need to die. 1/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic Fail.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen the original Japanese versions of both The Eye and The Eye 2 and they were delightful films, very scary. So one can imagine how excited I was when I saw that it was being re-made.Of course, they ruined it. Just like they ruined The Grudge 2.First off, I have to ask why they made Alba the star of this one. Are Japanese re-makes just ways to get awful actresses on screen? I admit, before Alba regains her sight, she does a pretty good job with acting. She also looks absolutely fantastic like that. However, after she gets her surgery operation thing, she goes back to looking like her normal self. I'm not a fan of Alba at all, I think she's terrible, but that aside, she should not have been cast for this role. It's like having a pop princess play a serious metal head in a horror movie. Why do it? I'm not one of those people who only ever watches Japanese movies and thinks that anything in English and played in theatres is awful. I liked The Grudge. But this movie was done so poorly, and gave no justice at all to the original. The Eye was an extremely creepy movie. This one was not in the least. I mean come on. A ghost restaurant? The only good thing I can say about this god awful piece of garbage is that they kept the creepy elevator man in there. He was awesome. But really. A ghost restaurant? I will never get over that. Ever. However, if you haven't seen the original, you might want to give this one a shot but only if it's on TV, do not waste money on this. Oh, and the doctor's a really annoying character too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than most recent Asian horror retreads</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jessica Alba stars in a remake of the Pang Brothers film from a few years back. The original Chinese film was one of the much heralded high points of the Asian horror wave of a few years back (along with the Ring and the Grudge). The story is of a woman who has an operation that restores her sight but which also lets her see ghosts and visions. The story has been done to death, but in the Pang Brother's hands it was considered a minor classic (I wasn't thrilled with it since I saw it too long after release it had been copied too many times). I did not want to see this film since Jessica Alba looks good but really can't act. Also most recent Asian horror remakes stink. To that end I was shocked to find that this retread actually works. Certainly no classic, it is scary and creepy. Jessica Alba is bland but turns in something like a performance. The images are frightening. The direction is taught (the opening sequence is excellent) with a nice uneasy feeling kept up through most of the film. Its not classic by any stretch of the imagination, but at the same time it is enjoyable and worth a bucket of popcorn and a soda at the movies.7 out of 10. (probably should be a 6 but since it isn't bad like most of the remakes I've rated it slightly higher)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film had enough essence to keep you interested for the entire 97 minutes, but doesn't prove as memorable once you leave the theater. The plot is somewhat new and fresh if you haven't seen the previous versions, and Alba finally showcases acting talent. Her portrayal of the blind is honest and relatable enough to draw the audience in. The other actors are good enough for their roles. The special effects are good and so is the editing. The underscore is suiting, especially when Alba plays the violin. Although classified as thriller or horror, the movie proves more suspenseful than anything else. Overall I rate this movie a fair 6 because it was well done but not good enough to watch again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Eye makes for a very entertaining thriller...not mind blowing but very good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Professional movie critics continually make me sick. They gave scathing reviews to The Eye and to its star Jessica Alba and NONE of it was justified period. The Eye is another entry in the long line of Asian Horror film updates, some of which have been drop dead amazing (The Ring) and others have been sub par and I think The Eye holds its own against any other terrific thriller. The film does really on what I have always called "Cheap scares", the things that jump out at you, loud noises, things that just make you jump off your chair rather than truly going for the ominous feeling of foreboding which it has a little of that too. As far as cheap scares go, it scores big with some truly creepy characters and moments. The twist to the whole film is that this isn't really about being haunted or a ghost terrifying someone but rather saving lives and its a very interesting twist to the whole thing very reminiscent of Final Destination. Relative new director David Moreau really does a terrific job at character development when it comes to the main character. He doesn't spare any details in making us understand her situation and the new experiences that her eyes are giving her.I happen to think Jessica Alba's performance in this film is brilliant. She does a terrific job and still looks beautiful and you easily are brought into her comfortable world where she has lost her eye sight since she was five. Alba has never really given any amazing performances but I believe she has talent and The Eye shows some of that. I also think its disgusting that professional movie critics are basically saying because she doesn't prance around in underwear or a bikini that there is no reason to see her because she does a great job period! Alessandro Nivola is good, although his character is a little underdeveloped considering how much time and effort they put into developing Alba's character. Still he does a good job and him and Alba have good chemistry together although their assumed romance is rather quick and awkward. Parker Posey (who I admit I can't stand) is her usual annoying over dramatic self. She kind of sticks out in this cast and really doesn't add much of anything to it. Fernanda Romero plays a small role as the girl who was the donor of Alba's eyes and the one trying desperately to contact her. She only has a few minutes of screen time but relies heavily on body language and facial expressions and does good doing that.In some ways The Eye can be compared to The Ring, which in my opinion is a huge compliment. The Eye sets up this situation and then sends the main character on a trek to discover the origin of the situation which turns out to actually be less ominous for her. There are some truly shocking moments including looking through the peep hole of her apartment, the "death bringers", and the "report card" boy freaked me out every damn time!! The story unfolds very well and you'll find yourself intrigued by every detail of the mystery. So treat yourself and do what I always recommend which is IGNORE conventional and professional reviewers and find out for yourself. This is the kind of good time you want at the movies! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Eye starring the beautiful Jessica Alba is a great film. It was directed perfectly. I thought the ghost looked fake but they were still scary, I just read a comment saying that the movie is just ghosts jumping out at you but it is almost the opposite in the scenes Jessica Alba seems to see something but it disappears, that's when you think it's gone, then something pops out, it is not the sound that scares you, it is the fear of thinking it is gone or not.This is a beautiful movie about Sidney Wells a major violist that gets a corneal transplant. It seems great at first but then Sidney (Jessica Alba) starts seeing deaths that either happened before or will happen in the future, sometimes in her dreams she gets visions about something, a fire etc. In the end she finally realizes what those visions are and tries to save everyone. But blinding herself in the process when a window shattered in front of her. In the end you see her, her eyelids closed playing the violin magnificently, she was at the concert. When the music stops Sidney opens her eyes to show that she was blind and she will always be blind forever...</fullReview>

I recently saw the original Japanese version on t.v. The Japanese version is better but this was a good movie. Lots of gotcha moments without the over done gore. The acting was good. Would have been nice to see the romantic aspect played up more between Alba's character and the the doctor. The Eye stayed very true to the original story line but with fresh interpretations. If you liked The Grudge you will like this movie as well. But again, I feel that the Japanese versions are better. Just a good all round scary movie.

		<fullReview>In "The Eye," a remake of a Chinese movie from 2002, Jessica Alba plays a blind woman who gets her sight back thanks to a successful cornea transplant. The only hitch is that with her new eyes - which were donated by a young lady with psychic powers - comes the unasked-for ability to see into the spirit world and predict the future."The Eye" might have been an interesting film had it focused solely on how a once-blind girl learns to adjust to life in a suddenly sighted world. Instead, we're subjected to an inane, gimmicky thriller in which the heroine improbably manages to run across either a dead person or someone doomed to die just about every time she turns a corner.There's no end of point-of-view shots in which ghouls jump out and yell "Boo!" at the audience, but the whole thing is about as scary as a youngster dressed in a bedsheet doing the same thing on Halloween.</fullReview>

I actually thought I was watching a made for TV movie.I don't blame the actors and certainly not Alba but it does show that the script and storyline can really let down actors and actresses. Alba in a Tarantino or Rodriguez movie is a different person. She is practically mystical when she works with them. In this however she is simply normal. Not that that's bad, she cant be mystical in every movie, but its a good job this wasn't her first big break or I fear we would never have seen her again.

		<fullReview>They've done it again: taken a highly successful foreign-made horror movie, and smeared it with lousy interpretation and cheap horror "jump out at you" scares for a fast food trash fest that is an insult to the original. The film makers bank on a high profile name for box office dollar signs, which invariably turns out to be a actor that wouldn't be convincing in the horror genre if you slipped a snake into their sleeping bag.The movie victim this time is Gin Gwai (from Hong Kong), which boasted clever writing to advance the intrigue of the main character's plight, and effected the terror in a logical and eerie way. A blind woman (an accomplished violinist) undergoes an operation which gives her sight. Along with normal vision, she unfortunately gets psychic vision as well. Not a bad premise (although it's been done a few times in the past), but this film just takes the idea and runs it through a meat grinder.Jessica Alba is woefully miscast in this potentially complex character whose terror we are supposed to experience vicariously. I was too busy laughing to believe she was blind, experiencing the gift of sight for the first time, being menaced by nightmarish visions; let alone feel for her or care about her ultimate fate. As a result, the outcome is anything but scary; cartoonish is a more accurate description.More laughs than scares. Jessica is at least pretty, but that's all she has to offer in this inept affair. See the original version, instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jessica Alba plays a woman who undergoes cornea transplants in a remake of a Chinese film of the same name.The moment she opens her eyes she starts to see things that aren't there. These include (a) a number of grim reapers, (b) recently dead people, (c) vivid images of someone else's past premonitions, and (d) a director and editor who aren't sure whether their making a horror film, thriller or a 'who dunnit?'.There is a faint oriental air to the film with does add a bit of mystery. This is essentially a relatively cheaply made Alba-vehicle. There is no-one else in it other than a periodically appearing sister and a doctor who you never quite get interested in as he has nothing of worth to say.You do jump from minor shock every now and then (but then an unexpected rapid orchestral crescendo does that to most people).The film is similar in feel to Sarah Michelle-Gellar's The Grudge. You are left with a similar feeling when you leave the cinema; a resigned "it was okay".</fullReview>

Since I haven't read the script (and honestly, why would I?), I don't know how much of this was actor's choices and how much of it was in the script, but all in all, the combination of forced, cheap jump scares and average to bad acting made this movie sub-par.Was it a waste of time?

		<shortDescription>Flawed as a horror film, but the story and concept are quite intriguing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sydney (Jessica Alba) ended up being blind at the age of 5 due to an accident. 20 years later she is given a cornea transplant which enables her to be able to see again. However, she soon starts to see things that other people are not able to and with the help of Dr Paul Faulkner (Alessandro Nivola), Sydney sets about trying to discover why she is seeing these disturbing images which eventually leads her all the way back to the donor of her eyes.I didn't realise (until I started watching this film) that this was a remake of a film that was originally produced in China. Although I haven't seen the original, I am a fan of Asian cinema and know that they are generally good at telling stories and usually do this sort of thing better than Hollywood - Oldboy is a good example of this. However, since I'm not in a position to draw comparisons, I'll stick to my thoughts on the American version that I've just watched. I quite liked the concept and found Sydney's initial journey of re-discovering the ability to see again to be fairly intriguing. The nightmarish visions at the start again add to the intrigue and set up what could have been a relatively suspenseful film.I think what really lets this film down is that in the second half it seemed to just become a rip-off of the Sixth Sense and it even has a touch of Ghost about it as well. I'm sure the phrase 'I see dead people' was used at one point. The scares that we see throughout the film are very clichéd, predictable and a little tiresome. The narrative is also a little repetitive as well.To its credit, the final third of the film offers some interesting twists and turns and the final analysis given by Sydney does certainly leave the viewer with something to think about. Ultimately, The Eye is watchable and I have to admit that 90 minutes passed by fairly painlessly and it never really became boring. It's pretty poor as a horror film, but the concept and story are both OK. Now that I know that there is an Asian original film to this out there then I'll be sure to check that version out (if I can find it).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young blind woman has her sight restored but comes to see disturbing visions. She must try and find out why the visions are occurring and what they mean.The Eye isn't an out and out horror relying more on tension than blood and guts to get it's scares. It's nicely filmed and fairly engrossing throughout with a few jump scenes. Jessica Alba does a good job in the lead role displaying a nice sense of vulnerability. Although it is not a great film by any means there is more than enough here to make this an enjoyable watch. It exceeded by admittedly low expectations and is worth a viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jessica Alba sees through the eyes of a donor with foresight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Eye" is a watchable horror story that's invested with quite a lot of neo-noir visual style and story elements. It's quite spooky in places. Jessica Alba is the protagonist and she carries the film very, very well. She shows a lot of range in her acting. She's supported by Parker Posey as her sister, and she too fills out her role nicely. The male support is Alessandro Nivola. He was reasonable in his role, at first being quite patronizing but then becoming more sympathetic and showing a hint that he was falling for his level-headed and attractive patient, even though she was being disturbed and stressed by visions associated with her cornea transplants having come from a girl who had such visions.Alba has a lot to contend with as a woman who has to learn to see and who right away is able to see spirits of the dead and the phantoms of death that accompany them. This would be hard for anyone to sort out. No one else can see what she sees.The story works at several levels, including the horror level and the detective level as she tries to sort out the mystery of her new eyes.I haven't seen the first version of this story, so there will be no comparisons made to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An under-rated must watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main goal of watching a movie is entertainment, this is one of the movies that meets it. Every time you insert a disk or open a file, what you will be watching is not necessarily going to be an Oscar winner and most times I prefer it not to be.The story line is awesome, Asian horror flick based after all. But the directing and the final twist is what makes this movie better than the original. This movie has been really under-rated and is a must watch, it has done quite well on most parts for scaring me (I watched tons of horror and I started doubting that if scaring someone through movies even possible).To be honest, after watching tons of horror flicks, this one gave me a fright after a long long time. It's saddening how horror these days have turned into torture porn, blood and gore. The reason most horror flicks don't pass the 6.0 IMDb wall is because they are unoriginal work patched and covered in lots of CG and loud screams to hide the poor effort, leading to the only "twist" by killing the protagonist.After watching this movie I did not feel like, "God, why did I watch this?" It goes into one of the movies without which my life would be incomplete and I would be missing a good experience. Concluding, a movie with some clean horror and an interesting storyline (that's all it takes to make a good horror movie).</fullReview>

While recovering from the operation, she realises that she's having strange visions. With the support of Dr. Paul Faulkner, Sidney finds who the donor of her eyes and begins a journey to find out the truth behind her visions.....Another J-Horror remake, made in a time when everyone was remaking them, thanks to the success of The Ring, and The Grudge, and don't forget, we had the influx of Gornography, and the slew of eighties horror remakes at this time, so to be fair, horror really suffered from 2006 to 2009.But the difference with this movie is that its the remake of a remake to an American movie, Blink, which is a really good standalone film.There is nothing new here, we get all the jump scares, people seeing things in a reflection, and dark shadowy figures taking people away.Alba is as good as she always is, but when it comes to it all, its not scary, and offers nothing new. If you are used to these silly remakes and find movies like Shutter, Apartment 1303, The Grudge, The Ring, One Missed Call et al, affable, its a watchable mess.And Alba is easy on 'The Eye'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From what I'd seen critics had lined up to pan this film, so for several years I didn't worry about it, and admittedly I've not seen the original version.However it's been bouncing around netflix recently and so I thought 'why not give it a go!?' - and do you know what? I was pleasantly surprised. It's never going to win any Oscars - but then again, I don't think it was made with that in mind, but for what it is it's a very solid film. The reason why I've given it a seven instead of a six (and it's not just due to the fact that Jessica alba is gorgeous) is because it does something that few horrors do nowadays, it actually builds a feeling of dread and suspense, playing off of the main character's blindness and sudden ability to see things very well. I'm not one for jumping normally but the sound is used to great effect here, and as I was listening through headphones I got it full throttle!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's begin with the positives, shall we? 1. Interesting concept; the film's premise (even though it's a remake) remains intriguing. 2. The progression of the narrative; the film's narrative is consistent, up to the end, at least.They're the positive aspects of this film. As for the negatives, oh, dear. I, personally, had numerous problems with the film, namely one Jessica Alba. Alba's performance is tedious, somewhat forced and ultimately lacking in any emotional empathy, shall we say, that she has, or, rather, is supposed to have, with her character. She was nominated for the Razzie award for Worst Actress 2008. No wonder. As for the other performances, they seemed to lack conviction, and, as a result, were equally mediocre. Moving on to what characterises most horror films; tension and suspense. This film was, again somewhat lacking, apart from a few effective jump scares, however, there were a few 'cheap scares' present, also, which were infuriating for the avid horror film fan. However, what irritated me most was the script; totally devoid of interesting dialogue, utterly dry, abrupt and forced. The climax of the film (without spoiling anything) conformed to the aforementioned criteria; abrupt, dissatisfying, predictable. To conclude, it's not really recommendable, especially for admirers of the first film.</fullReview>

I hated the way Change grim Reaper in this movie, made it look more scary with really poor silly CG1 effects.Which makes the movie lose a lot of it potential, The original made them look more realistic and found a lot more chilling as well.

		<fullReview>I knew this remake of the Asian hit was in trouble from the pre-credits opening sequence, in which a lame, CGI ghost is superimposed on the screen. With that to start us off, how much worse could it get? Soon after you begin watching, THE EYE reveals itself to be a humdrum viewing experience. The story, still so memorable (although it's years since I last saw the Chinese hit), involves Jessica Alba's character undergoing a cornea transplant after which she begins seeing the spirits of dead people. So far so SIXTH SENSE, you might think, but the supposed scare scenes in this flick are so well telegraphed in advance that only a blind viewer won't see them coming.Worse still, they make use of dodgy CGI apparitions ? the bane of the modern Hollywood ghost film. I'd like to see, just once, a movie that doesn't utilise these appallingly fake computer creations and allows mood to speak for itself. The storyline is vapid and uninteresting, and Jessica Alba (FANTASTIC FOUR) just doesn't cut it as a believable heroine ? her acting starts grating on the nerves after a while and she never convinces as a frightened victim.Every ghost film cliché is trotted out one after the other, leading to a saccharine ending that too-neatly ties everything up. I urge viewers to check out the original, on the offchance they haven't seen it, as it absolutely thrashes this one. Case in point: the celebrated elevator scene. In the original, it's one of those sequences that I had to watch behind splayed fingers, a truly disturbing horror experience enhanced by subtlety and a chilling soundtrack. Here, it's merely silly, utilising ludicrous CGI work of ghosts floating through walls and the like.Directors David Moreau and Xavier Palud previously made the outstanding French horror film THEM, but on the strength of this they should go back to film school.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm 56. I am of the world-weary, cynical 90s generation, yadda yadda. Did I like the film? I loved it. It's a film which can speak to young people, regardless of era. How better to depict the pressure, the confusion we sometimes feel, than that scene where Sydney dons scuba gear and is urged to get in the water...she is pushed into the water repeatedly...finally sinks deep in...The cinematography is fantastic. The *way* the film was shot...that in itself pushes the film above "average". It's true Sydney is too naive/plain-crazy to be "real". But Sydney is supposed to be viewed as a symbol of confused youth, of being unsure...lost. Alba was great (though I found it difficult to believe she was a star violinist!). In fact, I think the whole cast was wonderful.The scene I...remember the best, has to be the last scene. The couple has dashed onto the bus, full of adrenaline, passion. Then they sit down and... are silent. Not even looking at each other. The bus takes them God-knows-where...and the last shot, of their two heads through the back windows of the bus, separate from each other...one of those times you understand the phrase "a picture paints a thousand words".Oh, and that blond with the painted eyes and the little boy scene is way cool. :)</fullReview>

She has been typecast as a pretty girl / eye-candy, and not given a chance to prove her acting ability.While this film has faults, as do all films, I think it proves that she can connect with emotional reactions, and facial expressions needed for serious roles. She plays the part well, and can really display the anxiety and paranoia that can be felt when someone 'looses their mind'.Maybe everyone will disagree with me, which is fine, but I, for one, am very impressed by Jessica : Her portal of Sydney as a character is very believable, and very different from the type of roles she's been typecast in. She proves that beauty can also have acting wings : Go you!So there!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It may not be the gripping thriller that some might ask for, but as a chilling horror movie, The Eye is skillfully terrifying. The Eye, a remake of the 2003 Hong Kong film Gin Gwai, is about a young blind woman named Sydney Wells (Jessica Alba) who, after receiving a cornea transplant from an anonymous donor to get her eyesight back, begins to see (and even hear) terrifying visions of ghostly beings and dark images of death that no one else can see. Understandably, the most effective fright scenes take place at night when Sydney is alone in her bedroom. Even though most of the scares here are predictable and in part the result of jump shocking thrills, they nevertheless work. I came to find myself dreading the scenes where Sydney goes to bed, and sighing with relief when she woke up. The alone-in-the-dark scenes are fun, horrific rides, greatly helped by great camera-work and Marco Beltrami's eerie soundtrack. However, the film deserves kudos for having more than one scary scene in crowded, brightly-lit places - a café, an apartment hallway, a highway, a restaurant. Although The Eye does not, for the most part, live up to the original, fans of Gin Gwai may be pleased by the many scenes in this remake inspired from the original, most notably the classic elevator scene. Unfortunately, like so many other movies I've reviewed, it's the third act of The Eye which causes a drop in my and most of the professional critics' scores. This part of the film focuses too much on who Sydney's donor is and why she is experiencing visions, and it does so poorly. The climax of the film, although having cool visual effects, is a huge mess story-wise, having very little to do with the main plot of the film. However, I really don't believe I'm being very generous in giving this film a positive rating, as the downsides of the ending don't outweigh the superb thrills of the first half. This 2008 remake The Eye is recommended to any fan of supernatural horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No, seriously, that's a line in this. What, you mean you have an active subconscious? Is it legal to be that ignorant as an adult in a first-world country? This is yet another Americanized remake of Asian horror, and it completely blows it, as is usually the case(seriously, other than The Ring, they all suck; they don't even wait very long to do them). I think it says a lot that what this is based on uses shadows and vague, if at times grotesque, images, and this uses rising flames and outright explosions. The pretense of this being sophisticated is immediately tossed out the window, as this opens with glamour shots of Alba(honestly, other than Sin City, can you think of a passable performance of hers?), just barely going with showing her perspective with the other senses(what's with the Daredevilling? It was a mere five years old at this point, and it didn't do well), and covering up that she is nothing other than eye-candy, in this as in everything else she's in. They fail in their attempts at making her likable, as she's selfish and, well, they forgot to give her a genuine personality(there is *no* drama in this, no emotion is evoked; can you keep from chuckling at her in the bandages?). Pollux Troy is obnoxious and the two have zero chemistry, and every other character is one-note and boring. Is anyone acting in this? It had 90 minutes to capture my attention, and it didn't. Why is Posey playing "normal"? Did she walk onto the wrong set? Moretz... *that's* Hit Girl, who everyone is praising as a great young talent? Did she learn after appearing in this? At least they did that accurate to the original, with the friend at the hospital not looking like a female. Oh, they have sequences from it. They're often carelessly rehashed(at times downright phoned in), once they run out they simply repeat them, and they detract, rather than add. A couple are stripped of their relevance. Of the new things included, only one is interesting, and none of them impact the whole. This can't go ten minutes without *something* happening(several occurrences are out of nowhere and could be cut and it would only get shorter; this is in such a hurry, nothing is allowed to linger or sink in), and with no build-up, it doesn't "work"; we don't care. It tries *way* too hard, constantly throwing crap at us. The jump-scares are dumb. Those can be great, they aren't here. A couple of things are dumped into this with no effort made to render them effective. The bland and manipulative score is kind enough to let us know when this is meant to be creepy - you know, like the laugh-track on a sitcom. Fear the sound of a spoon being dropped! Find yourself in the grip of pure terror at the sight of ghosts that are pale *and* nearly have pronounced facial features! Is this for real? I don't think the duo of French directors were right for the subtle tone this ought to go for; I might give Ils a chance. What's to be afraid of in this? The scientific explanation removes any anxiety that might have been established(in my case, none)! Why is this so tough a concept? If we don't know, we'll be wary of it. When we do, we can label it and calm down. The latter is *not* the goal of this genre. This refuses to let the viewers use their imagination, using cheap and obvious narration(that of Gin gwai wasn't actually bad), as well as dialog, to spell *everything* out. The editing and cinematography aren't devoid of skill, but they're over-stylized, with, for example, a handful of quick flashes of meaningless "freaky" sights. After a lousy conclusion(nope, they didn't bother to fix the last third, in fact, they worsened it), they run the ending credits over schlocky pop to incite audiences to run out of the theater. I'm left with numerous questions, not all of them spoiler-free. What's with the surprise party? Was there anything to it, since we don't meet these people again? Wouldn't they know not to rush her like that? Who would take a chain-smokers donated liver, as it's probably not in that good shape? Where did all that smoke go, from one second to the next? Did they do all they could to locate and hire the most white Mexican I've seen in my life(xenophobia much?)? How does this manage to be quite *this* average(the FX are reasonable, and of all the aspects of this, they're the best as far as quality goes)? And finally... why? Well, that one, I can answer. Profit. A lack of respect for cinema-goer intelligence. The irrational idea that the prospect of reading subtitles is enough to deter people from these(right? C'mon, don't let something that meager talk you out of a movie). There is a ton of disturbing content and mild to moderate violence, a little strong language and a few instances of nudity. The DVD comes with four featurettes(one of them insisting that parapsychology is real) coming to a total of 20 minutes, 11 minutes of deleted scenes and half a dozen trailers. I recommend this to those who enjoy leering at Jessica. 5/10</fullReview>

Nothing really makes sense until the last few minutes of the movie, but that's OK. Some suspenseful moments, but too many jump shocks that quickly wear thin. And Jessica Alba is OK, but just OK, in the lead. She's pretty but not much of an actress. To be fair, very few Asian ghost/horror movies play particularly well in their American remakes. The ending looks like it could have come from THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES or any FINAL DESTINATION film, only it's not executed as well. There are also bits lifted from GHOST WHISPERER. And there's a recurring spectral character who may remind some of the obnoxious paper boy from BETTER OFF DEAD. Stick with BLINK starring Madeleine Stowe, which tells a similar story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eye see ghost creatures! And they don't know they're in a remake. . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This hastily done version of an oriental horror film (Gin Gwai) is the cinematic equivalent to a microwavable TV dinner: easy to digest, but a soon forgotten item that was nothing special. It plays out something like a conglomeration of Eyes of Laura Mars, 6th Sense, and Ghost. This movie (or rather the one it's remaking) adds enough that's new to make the movie able to stand on its own. Many oriental horror movies focus on a vulnerable, everyday person (easy to sympathize with) being menaced by an unseen, apparently paranormal being. The interest and scariness of the story is maintained by knowing only what the character knows, as they gradually learn what the entity is and what it wants. The director makes a fair attempt to maintain this approach by building the suspense with logical plot development. However, some events seem to be randomly thrown in that don't advance the story. Another weakness is the use of corny horror genre crutch of "jump out at you suddenly and scream loudly with the volume increased" in some scenes. Jessica Alba, the sun-drenched beauty, might seem to be a casting blunder, more suited to Bay Watch "eye candy" joke films than a role that actually requires her to act. Frankly, her poor acting history reputation kept me from paying my hard-earned money at the box office, when I saw her name in the cast. When the film became free on cable, I gave it a chance, not expecting much. Alba's performance, while slightly marred in places by over-emoting, was overall her best to date, and actually a strength to the movie. She makes Sidney, a blind violinist who begins to experience terrifying visions of tragedies after receiving vision-restoring surgery, a believable person to care about. If you can find the original Gin Gwai, watch that. If not, settling for this weaker version can kill some spare time when you're bored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Eye was OK; the idea was nothing new, and it really didn't have any unique scenes that make you jump. Jessica Alba, whom is actually decent in this, plays Sydney a blind violinist that receives a corneal transplant. Once she can start to see, she starts seeing weird things, like fire, kids in the hall in her building, and dark shadows that appear to be leading people somewhere. She sees a specialist, Paul, whom tries to convince her that her mind is getting used to sight again and all those things aren't real. When she walks through a lady and goes into a diner that suddenly is a burned out empty store, she is convinced that she has to find out the donor of her eyes. Paul finally helps her out and they go to Mexico to find the donor's family. They learn from her mother that her daughter, the donor, had visions and would warn people of death. On the way back, they are stuck in traffic and Sydney finally figures out her visions were of the future and she is supposed to get people out of cars before a gas truck explodes.The creepiest scene is when Sydney looks in the mirror and sees a different face staring at her.FINAL VERDICT: It was OK. It had a few scary scenes. I recommend it for horror fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Typical, You spend 15 years waiting to get some vision back, and what happens? You get two come along at once. Talk about second sight...OK, that'e enough with the puns. I was never a huge fan of the J horror films from a few years back. The films were strong on creating a brooding atmosphere of dread but were low on horror, and while I could appreciate the quality of workmanship and skill in the Asian films I could never really get into them.American filmmakers have tapped into this difference between eastern and western expectations from their horror films and try to combine both elements, usually with limited success. This film, while probably more successful than many of the US remakes, is a good example. Probably it's biggest flaw is that it tries to include all the incidents from the original film but neglects to adequately explain some of them.For all the criticism Jessica Alba received for her lead role of Sydney, the blind violinist who starts seeing terrifying visions after receiving corneal transplants, I can't say her performance registered as being particularly poor. She's OK, and she looks cute and vulnerable which is a major plus for a heroine in peril role. For me Alesandro Nivola as the doctor who reluctantly comes to believe her plight, is the weak link with a dull, insipid reading of the part.This is not a great film, but it's an adequate time-passer that proves to be as entertaining as the original - even if it is for different reasons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie could be much better than really is; in my opinion the plot could have been better worked and there are some parts that should be better explained.Although I don't think Jessica Alba is the right person to do this character, I think she did a great job as the blind musician that receives a cornea donation.However, the movie claims for more atmosphere, more breathtaking moments and more dynamic directing. It is not even close to be a scary movie, if that was the original intention. It's a nice movie for the times you have nothing else to do, but it's not a must-see, definitely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't know much about the movie or it's original idol but after watching it i'm not disappointed. Jessica Alba in this movie plays a blind woman who get's an eye transplant and soon after the operation begins to see strange things. First that seems to be normal because of the aftereffects of the operation, but later she learns that those are not optical Illusions or the like but a sideeffect of the transplant she got, she sees what the former owner of her eyes saw.The acting is not too bad, on the other hand no one probably will receive an Oscar for the performance, but everyone seems to catch a drift of the characters they play and so the movie is somewhat believable. There are some special effects that are integrated into the scenes fair enough to not look ridiculous or bad. I liked the story though I also saw 'blink' 10+ years ago, but that wasn't a negative influence for my viewing pleasure, maybe because I cannot remember much of 'blink'. If you like Mysterymovies and Jessica Alba you probably wanna see this, if not, well it's still a well made movie, maybe a little slow at times but nice to watch nonetheless. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad considering its remake and genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came away pleasantly surprised since most supernatural thrillers Hollywood produces travel a narrow water line between desperately stupid and disgusting scripts and acting.This film impressed me, that there may still be some producers and script writers who continue to take this film genre seriously.No bad slashers, excessive blood, horrid sex scenes. The film just about held its own from start to finish. To understand where the script is headed, you really need to watch it all way through.There were some odd scenes however. I don't know of any hospital as dark and deserted as the one used here. Perhaps it was more for effect, rather than realism. But, this film did not have annoying smart mouthed and brats characters as many.I rented the DVD and felt I had not wasted my money. Believe me its tough these days to rent, watch and then avoid throwing up.This film will satisfy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very good movie, with plenty of chills and a good plot. The problem may be that we have been watching years of The Ghost Whisperer, Medium, the X-Files and The Mothman Prophecies (Richard Gere, Laura Linney, Debra Messing).The problem with television today is that there are such high standards of writing and production, that it almost makes movies irrelevant.So if you are an impressionable mid-teen, this might be just new enough to you to be enjoyable. If not, mid-way you are saying "But what do the ghosts want from Jessica?". Anyway, the scares are pretty good, Jessica Alba is delectable. However, Allessandro Nivola must be the most unsympathetic and uncharismatic leading man in a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bought The Eye after my best friend told me that it was great. Personally I was skeptical but decided that I should buy it anyway. I am glad I did. Alba plays her role well as does the rest of the cast. I definitely thought that the donor (Ana)was showing Sydney her memories but I had no idea that it was a prediction as well. Coming from someone who isn't into all this kind of stuff anymore, The Eye is a definite buy just because it doesn't embody what Hollywood has classified as "the horror movie". It shows little to no blood and keeps you in the movie from start to finish. I highly recommend this movie to any who are tired of Hollywood's slasher crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jessica Alba is a force o be reckoned with. In "The Eye", she plays Sydney Wells, a blind woman who gets a second chance with new eyes. However, the donor had a secret that would send her world Topsy-turvy. The eye Sydney has can see things that normal people would dread. She can see into the world of the supernatural! The person who died had the ability to see beyond, and the neighborhood in her country got spooked. Her new eye may have scared her, but it was put into good use when the explosion occurred out on the border which claims the eyes. But not her spirit. Syndey enjoyed being able to see again, but she knows now to view the world around her without sight. Very mild horror, can be a bit scarier though. With a plot to be known for. There are other movies dealing with second sight. This one is sexier and entertaining which I liked. A MAJOR KEEPER! 3.5 OUT OF 5 STARS!</fullReview>

The horror here mainly is bases on a side character (the 'transporter' shadows) which have no real meaning and purpose in the plot.Truly disappointing, especially when it is clearly visible that the cast. budget and scenes were of very good quality. Only the idea (creativity and originality) were missing this movie to be really, really good.The money is spent, the movie is average (at the best). The energy is spent unworthy.Clearly big movie industry has lost the touch with original and creative writers, or just doesn't allow them to break-through the mediocre scenarios and writers...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HK Neo Reviews: The Eye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tagline: A more than credible effort for a remake? Review by Neo: The Pang brothers were famous for one film and it is really the only film that qualifies them as great directors. The Eye established the Pang Brothers entrance into HK and later into the Hollywood adventure, but in all truthfulness, while their films are always beautiful and stylish to look at; the substances in recent times have been largely questionable. Using the words from Bey Logan, the Pang Brothers have "a great eye" and vision and story of The Eye is easily their best effort to date. With Hollywood running out of ideas, it is just the norm to remake films from the best of Asia and most notably the Oscar Winning film Departed. While the aforementioned flick is questionably good, it somehow still managed to win the Oscars, despite being ten times worse than the original Infernal Affairs, in Neo's honest opinion. It is double injustice when you think back in 2002 Oscars; Infernal Affairs did not win the Best Foreign Film Award. Luckily, the latest remake of The Eye is able to hold its own and does so efficiently and effectively as a thrilling that is exactly thrilling. Now that's a rare sight in Hollywood.Perhaps the funniest aspect of this review is that Neo still haven't mentioned his favourite Hollywood hot tie, in Jessica Alba. In previous reviews, Neo would have already declared his love of the aforementioned hot tie, just to remove any sort of bias that he maybe concurring towards. Still, The Eye all, but confirmed that Alba can act and the good news is that she is still hot as well. In a comparison of Angelica Lee and Jessica Alba, both playing the same role, there is no doubt each is better in their own ways, Lee is certainly a better actress and Alba is way hotter. With that being said, Alba more than holds her own in this role and the result is being able to hold onto the audience from the start till the very ending. Now that's an achievement to be proud of.Moving on, there are some scenes that are worthy of special mention for instance the exhilarating final bus bomb sequences as well as the recreation of the Chinese restaurant haunting sequences. You know a movie isn't bad, when it is at the very least thrilling and at times exciting.All in all, The Eye is good, because the original story is a good one, but some credit must still be given to the director for executing his own imprint into a remake. With that being said, there is no point comparing the original to the latest remake, as each is targeted at a different audience. While the Pang Brothers have a great eye and style, the US version cares more about being efficient and effective than anything else. Still, The Eye somehow manages to be an adequate movie and as far as remake is concerned, it isn't half bad and having Alba in the mix always help, especially when the current reviewer is a male? (Neo 2008) I rate it 7.5/10- www.thehkneo.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sydney, a young, blind violinist is given the chance to see for the first time since childhood through a miraculous corneal transplant. As Sydney adjusts to a dizzying new world of colors and shapes, she is haunted by frightening visions of death itself capturing the doomed and dragging them away from the world of the living. Terrorized and on the brink of insanity, Sydney must discover whose eyes she has inherited, and what secret visions they have held."The Eye" is certainly not a bad film. However, it's not also a really good one. Overall, this film can be seen as one of the better horror remakes released this time, excluding "The Ring." What is different about this film s that there are no little girls with long hair! Isn't that surprising?The film does a well job holding your attention until the end, although it's a bit dull around the second act. This film also managed to pull off some effective scares but not enough to satisfy horror fans. Surprisingly, there is some character development here, something you don't usually see in your horror remakes.Unfortunately, you can't help but think this film borrows a lot from previous films, most notably "Final Destination" and "Ghost" and even "White Noise 2." The performance by Jessica Alba is decent, although nothing special.Overall, this is a decent remake with some effective chills and an explosive ending that would leave you well, interested, since nothing else in the movie is a surprise. Give this a rent if you're interested.</fullReview>

It was a good movie and Jessica Alba plays character correctly however in some points I was confused on the things she could that perhaps a true blind person would not be able to...so in general it was not believable that she was blind.If you are looking for a horror movie to give you a few screams or yelps...this is the movie for you..however if you prefer a horror movie that builts up on a story...then please move on.</fullReview>

It relies on very deceptive thrills that are pretty predictable and Alba isn't really much of an actress in my opinion - or at least not in this film.The ending also, while it stuck with it, was altered to make it, in my opinion a more easier explanation for the conclusion whereas the original had a much more dramatic touch to it which was probably one of the main disappointments about this version.I had a feeling this was going to be bad. I really am trying to get over my prejudice for American horror remakes. Don't get me wrong because some have been decent - The Ring for one, but this one has given me more of a bias towards them than ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good job Ms. Alda!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When people think of the movie that gave the boost to Jessica Alba's career, they think of "The Eye" which is totally correct in my opinion. However, even though she deserves a nomination for his role as Cindy Welles, and considering the fact that she is my favorite actor, I must admit that I believe she did such a good job in the movie because she was acting with some of the best actors of all-time. I believe that the team they made is really what makes this movie an American classic of American A-Horror.Sometimes I feel like Cindy, though I haven't had an optic nerve transferral, nor have I had the misfortune of having to sit in front of a fish tank the size of New Jeresey. Okay, maybe I don't, but as a college student/soon to be grad and practicing violinist I can definitely share Cindy's worries. A worthy film in every respect, and it's probably the only time where you'll see a crucifix used as a weapon when not flashed before vampires! "The Eye" is one of those trail-blazing films of the new millennium that continues to get better with repeated viewings.Jessica Alda (Oscar-nominated?) stars as the title character, a young woman who does not know what she really wants in life. Alda becomes basically a "play-thing" in a loveless relationship with supernal forces, and she realizes that what she thought she wanted was not what she really wanted after all. She becomes fixated on blurry photoshop-filtre-effects type 'ghosties'. She becomes so obsessed that he breaks up an auction. In the end she causes mayhem and creates havok, but at the end the question is: Now what? "The Eye" is biting satire at its finest.It is a horror movie, but its focus goes much further than that. The directorial team of David Pallud And Xavier Holland examines sexual relationships and relationships in general. They creates an atmosphere that is so realistic that the audience feels the pain of each of the characters. Alda proved to be a high-class actor here and Parker Posey solidified her career even further. This film is the first that really examined the Chinese take on the supernatural and this fact as much as anything makes "The Eye" one of the more important movies in the history of the cinema.The only flaw the movie has is a rather simple dialogue but the originality of the script is so good that it helps back-up the movie's only weak spot. Highly recommended. A great achievement. 10 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..."The Eye" (yet another remake of a 2002 Asian cult film, which itself was a moody riff on an earlier American film) serves as little more than a vehicle for Jessica "Awake" Alba to stretch her acting chops. Said chops are adequate, and I give her props for learning to play the violin for the role, but Ms. Alba, despite her beauty, is no Madeleine "Blink" Stowe nor even an Angelica "Gin Gwai" Lee, her predecessors in gifted sight. Scripted and directed by the duo that brought us "Ils" aka "Them" in 2006, "The Eye" follows a blinded-since-youth musician into a haunted world of precognition and spiritualism after the lady receives a set of transplanted eyes from a donor with--surprise, surprise!--those selfsame powers. The effects work is decent, as is the camera-wrangling by Jeff "Dirty Dancing" Jur, the fade-to-black-rich editing of Patrick "Dracula 2000" Lussier, and the nervous score by Marco "Scream" Beltrami. I also give the rewrite props for incorporating a hefty number of solid Latino actors, including the lovely model, Fernanda Romero, and the very talented Rachel "Total Recall" Ticotin, but despite this nod to the fastest growing segment of our population, "The Eye" is unable to provide much in the way of fresh vision. As I said, pretty much strictly for Alba fans, or indiscriminate consumers of thriller fare. It's really not much on scares (most of which are "boo!" moments), and it's not terribly creepy or unsettling. Mostly, it's conventionally predictable, finishing off with a Hollywood ending that fails to satisfy in any memorable fashion. Me, I say go watch "Blink."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Decent Remake... Alba Shines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young woman (Jessica Alba) has been blind since a childhood fireworks accident. Now an adult, she receives a cornea transplant from an unknown donor (which is apparently a routine procedure, at least in this world). But the cornea comes with something of a curse: the donor had the unfortunate ability to see the dead, and it's no surprise that in many cases the dead hate the living. Can the curse be lifted?"The Eye" is a remake of an Asian horror film from a few years ago, also titled "The Eye". As I was a fairly big fan of the original, I was hesitant to give the new one a chance. But of course, we always have to see the remakes to see what was changed and if they were able to make the film better. The selling point that pushed me from having no interest to a mild interest was Jessica Alba, who I'm happy to say does a fine job here and looks the best she's looked since "Idle Hands". Blind, even. The good news here is that unlike many remakes, this one isn't a complete stab in the back of the original. In fact, I rather liked it for the most part... which surprised me at first, and even more so when I found out this came from the writer of that legendary flop "Snakes on a Plane".The general plot remained the same, with an eye transplant that allows the recipient to see ghosts. And some of the creepier ghost scenes were maintained. Notably, the floating man in the elevator. This stood out as the most disturbing part of the first film, so I'm glad they were able to reproduce it in such an effective way. Beyond that, there are some departures, not all of which are bad. Whereas "The Grudge" remake took pains to keep the story set in Japan, "The Eye" feels no compulsion to remain on the Asian continent. I think this was a wise move, especially for American audiences. This also allows the introduction of the Mexican "bruja", which would have been out of place before.One issue I had was the nature of the scare tactics the film uses. The original relied more on a dark atmosphere, with the only "jump" scene that really stood out being the "what are you doing in my chair?" scene (you know what I mean if you saw it). Now we have jump after jump after jump. That's bush league horror movie material, designed to frighten teenage girls so they clutch their boyfriends. Where's the real psychological terror of having your eyes turn against you? But, I admit I jumped, so I guess their plan worked.I'm also skeptical of the idea that tissue samples can retain the memories of the donor. Especially in such small organs as corneas. So, it was a bit hard for me to swallow the idea that she'd gain full witch powers. I can accept seeing dead people (and yes, there is a "Sixth Sense" reference in this movie), but why can she hear them? Why does she usually see the dead, and at other times she can see the future or entire rooms? Why do some people get carted off by death and others relive their deaths over and over? A lot of questions are raised and not really addressed. What really confused me was the inconsistency of some people's ghost appearance. Some (such as elevator man) look like their dead self, while others (report card boy) look perfectly fine. I will have to side with the original, first out of courtesy and second because it's simply the better film. The 2008 Alba version has its perks (such as Jessica Alba, and Chloe "the Dakota Fanning of Horror" Moretz), but also falls into too many of the Hollywood trap. Style over substance, dangling plot lines and more. While it was still good and I wouldn't discourage you from seeing it, I will say I'm rather pleased that a sequel is not currently in the works (though who knows).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good scares, big flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We have just gotten over the big craze that was Jessica Alba, which I felt so bad for the girl, someone gets brutally publicized and rubbed in your face for how hot they are and how hot you'll never be, they tend to become box office poison and bashed by the public. So naturally when The Eye was released this year, it didn't make number one and was automatically canned as a bad movie; me? I just preferred to wait for the rental, I watched The Eye at home the other night and actually it wasn't as bad as I was expecting from some of the comments here on IMDb, I was expecting this to be a terrible movie. Normally most of the American remakes of Japanese horror films are, but The Eye does deliver some good scares, until the ending. Not to mention, bad casting, Jessica Alba is fine, the script is bad, and for a blind woman who lives alone, she dresses very well and her hair is perfect. The script just wasn't realistic and the actors over did a lot of the movie and it makes you just want to scream at the screen.Sydney Wells is blind, lives alone, plays the violin, and everyone just loves her. She finally gets an eye transplant, everything seems to be going fine, until well, I figured out from this movie, don't just ask if you donor was health, a non smoker, non drinker, drug free, also, ask if they saw dead people. Because that's Sydney's problem, she is seeing people die right in front of her and she has to learn what this power was meant for and must find out about the donor and her creepy history.Now The Eye has some creepy moments, though I'm not a big fan of the jump scares, they got me a few times. But once again, the CGI, it's very noticeable and cheesy, was it just me, or did it seem like the creatures that took these people's souls to wherever, were just a cheap rip off of Ghost? Not to mention that the script was cheesy and the ending wasn't up to par with what this film could have been. I know there are lovers of the film and there are haters, but I can't help but be between because the movie had potential, there are just some flaws here and there. Jessica Alba being perfectly beautiful throughout the film, the lines, the way it seems like every "crazy" person really does act crazy throughout the film and shows everyone how crazy they are, just you'll see what I mean if you watch this film.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good movie, but not a great movie. At the beginning we have the impression that we will see a fabulous movie. But in the middle, the history became a bit of "water with sugar", with a predictable love story. The way that the director found to explain the appearance of the shadows and because they appear, not is the credible too. Explanation too simple to a problem so complex. I was expected a more strong reason to all events that previous the clarification. Alessandro Nivola is not a great actor, need improvements. In many moments he don't act in a credible way. Jessica Alba show that is a versatile actress, and she is the best in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An average film unfortunately. We've seen these ideas in previous films Blink and The Mothman Prophecies. The whole foresight of impending disaster and the beautiful girl who is given someone else's eyes only to regret the decision is not a completely new concept. This is a remake of a Chinese film which I imagine would be somewhat better than its Hollywood counterpart. The film centres around a girl who's been blind since she was five and receives a cornea transplant to restore her sight. After said surgery, cue weird visions, seeing ghosts etc, along with a plot twist that anyone could figure out, and we are left with a serious sense of Deja Vu. Jessica Alba delivers an average performance, in a film thats all been done before. One to watch on a quiet month.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another day, another J-Horror Remake. And while "The Eye" may have its up sides like most others this only succeeds in making you want to revisit the Japanese original. Jessica Alba is an odd actress. How is it that she can go from brilliance (Sin City) to utter rubbish (The Eye) and while the movie may suck she and the rest of the rather assembled cast do their best at trying to reconstruct the feel of the original. Witch only furthers the ultimate question. Why even bother remaking a film that A) is a hell of a lot better than the remake and B) already appeals to a massive audience.And while "The Eye" might not stoop to the "Unwatchable" level of "One Missed Call" or "The Ring Two" it still isn't very good. It provides solid scares but little to no atmosphere. Witch any fan of the original will know is the bedrock of any Japanese Horror film. One of the poorest scripts of the year combine dull plot twists and some of the driest and overused duologue of all time "I'm seeing...." a line quickly followed by Alessandro Nivola "Dead People" line. A truly cringe worthy moment. The eye does have some up sides as I'm sure I have mentioned before. One the surface it's a highly polished fright fest and at a mere 90 minutes it clearly doesn't outstay its welcome. At heart it even manages a fearsome physiologic connection with the audience that should keep you gripped for most of the film. Even that can excuse the reasoning of why you would chooses to see this over the original.Sydney Wells (Jessica Alba) has been given the gift of sight, but it comes with a horrifying price in the English-language remake of Danny and Oxide Pang's The Eye. The double corneal transplant was to open up a new world for Sydney, a concert violinist whose blindness has plagued her since childhood. With the help of Dr. Paul Faulkner (Alessandro Nivola) and sister Helen (Parker Posey), Sydney's operation and recovery seemed to be on the road to success -- until horrific images start to tear their way into her newfound vision.What's worse is that these episodes appear to foreshadow future deadly events, leading Sydney on a mission to track down the person whose eyes she has inherited and discover what kind of mystery from beyond the grave lies before her. The film is directed by David Moreau and Xavier Palud, the duo behind the acclaimed 2006 French terror flick Them, and is produced by Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner under their Cruise/Wagner production banner.In all "The Eye" is one hell of a mixed bag. Jumping from ridiculous plot twist to another and whilst the frights are solid and the acting is commendable it's just not enough to excuse such a shabby script and cheerful ending (that doesn't actually occur in the Japanese original)The best thing you could do would be to go rent Gin gwai to see how a real horror film should be done as it still remains one of my favorite J-Horrors just behind "Ringu" for now though this is a half decent placebo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had to take my eye off it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be quite honest, with this trend of Japanese horror films being given the western re-rub you can't help but feel they're just being used as premade films for Hollywood to churn out with the current hottie of the hour at the ship's helm. The Grudge wasn't too bad, still a bit eery, same goes with The Ring, but all this does is sets itself up for a barrage of Scary Movie 5 jokes. From the get go it didn't really appeal to me, I think the commercial psyched me out more and not even that was that effective. More often than not, if not always, the translation is never half the film the original was. Before they're remade the Japanese aren't afraid to have that little bit more dialogue to get a little more tension, whereas here they just cut to the chase before you even realise the scene has been set. Anyways, enough of my opinion on Hollywood and these remakes, on the whole, couldn't watch it to the end, bored me stiff, watch something which might actually scare you like Pet Cemetery or 1408, but i don't recommend you watch this suitable for kids nonsense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And so it is that yet again American producers and writers can not think for themselves as yet another remake goes wrong.I liked the original Pang Bro's version. They do some good films. I had no faith that this remake would do the source material justice in any way and it didn't. I don't quite understand how all the Japanese/Chinese/Korean/Thai remakes miss the mark. Maybe it's the $$ signs that the American rip off artists see and care about most.The Eye manages to keep the basics from the original film but looses the tension and atmosphere. It's such a disappointment. Just a bit more work by the writers and they might just have managed to translate to American audiences what the Pang Bro's original film did. Even having 2 directors on this film could not recreate the freshness of the original. What we end up with is another run of the mill, quick scary images and quick scary noises, horror remake. The characters are flat are you really don't care for them. The story is not as involving as it should be and really isn't the best . The realisations near the end of the film in the original which catch your attention and make you think are completely lost in this remake as you really don't care and haven't been given enough reason to care about the main characters.There's no point in commenting on the actors or such as the generalisation now for these remakes is that Hollywood and the big shots care only for money and have not got the foggiest idea of how to be original or to take a concept and pay homage to it's source material and ideas. It's a shame the lamen out there don't culturalise themselves with world cinema - if they did, we wouldn't suffer crappy remakes. Shame people are too lazy to read subtitles.</fullReview>

It was great! I think the statement 'American's can't think' has more to do with you because when the movie was labeled as 'cover' you just thrown it to the rubbish movie-can. CAN YOU THINK? And another thing that shocked me, like this is an American movie, w00t? HOW?IN WHAT WAY? For the ones that made this statement, guys, do you even know what you are talking about? Just because it is a copy of another movie and this is 'made for Americans'(which I totally not agree) this movie has nothing even close to horror American movies, were you watching this during sex with your girlfriends? All in all, Jessica Alba made a very good performance, the directing was GREAT, sound, image and story very good. So okay, this is not an original movie, everybody likes original movies but DO NOT, I REPEAT, DOOOOOOOOO NOOOOOOOT think that if it is a copy it is rubbish, you are just stupid for thinking that. Originality is to be appreciated but most of the times I have found covers/remakes a lot better, and that is not just for movies. And what is all the fuss about 'this movie is stupid, just a lame remake of the original', there are soooooo many remakes and so many covers and so many movies inspired by others that are appreciated, but if the producers labels it 'cover' then it must be bad,right, if they say nothing about 'well I inspired myself from....etc' then the movie is good? That is just wrong. Did you know that saw is a cover from the movies 'the cube'? Neah you probably don't know,everybody loves saw,I don't,after seeing cube it was just 'deja vu', but still, saw was a great movie. Anyway stop talking rubbish about this movie, I felt quite thrilled and exhilarated watching it and I do not know what person in the right mind(that was not making sex during the movie) wouldn't enjoy The eye!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see "The Eye" with no reservations in my mind. I had only seen a couple of trailers and thought it looked good, but didn't do any research prior to going. Now I wish that I had.What is so bad about this movie? For starters, the plot was practically nonexistent and could be described in a sentence or less. I won't share that sentence because I don't want to put a spoiler in here. The entire film was less-than-inspired, with each scene bland and pointless.As for the 'scary' aspect of the film, it tried hard to make the audience jump every ten minutes or so with the standard cheap thrill of a completely quiet scene interrupted with a loud scream or other sound. There were a number of gory images, but they were presented in short clips, with ten or twenty images in about a second. I suppose that was supposed to be scary, but it really served to break up the otherwise dull plot.One of the biggest disappointments with "The Eye" is the filming. Half the film is intentionally out of focus, another quarter is filmed by someone running with a camera (read: jumpy and nausea-inducing), and the rest was standard filming with a couple special effects.So, all-in-all, unless you crave a film that inspires migraines, avoid "The Eye."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not seen the original 2002 Asian movie that this remake is based on. However, I do have a feeling that the original must have been a lot better that this. There is a very familiar deja-vu feeling to just about all of this movie. Every plot twist and turn came across as tired and unoriginal. Needless to say, this also extends to the so-called scares. There is nothing creepy or frightening about the horror sequences. I think the reason for the lack of frights is that the movie, while somewhat low budget, is all the same too slick for its own good. A gritter and less polished approach would have probably helped things significantly. In the end, the only interesting part of the movie are the opening minutes, showing the blind heroine going through life with her handicap and learning to adjust once she gets her sight back. Had the whole movie been about all that, I think I would have enjoyed it a lot more.</fullReview>

She makes friends with a patient Alicia (Chloë Grace Moretz) at the hospital. Her sister Helen (Parker Posey) who feels responsible for her blindness tries to help. Dr. Paul Faulkner (Alessandro Nivola) is her new doctor helping her to adjust.Based on a Chinese horror, this is a pretty slim movie with few actual frights. It doesn't have any moodiness for atmosphere. It's not particularly creepy. The vision isn't handled with the best imagination. It's a lot of music cues to highlight visions. My question is why does her visions talk to her if she only did the eyes. So she sees not only memories but the future, death, and ghosts. It's a mishmash of random interior movie logic. There is nothing particularly wrong in this movie aside from the fact that there is nothing particularly right. Then there is the climax which isn't setup that well and seems to come out of nowhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original, I'll just comment on the title. I picked it off the 'horror' movies section but in all truth I think it'd better put in the sci-fi/documentary section.A cortex replacement that causes a girl to see things, okay. Well it's an interesting concept. The most interesting idea is when she sees herself in the mirror for the first time and it's not her, now that I did not expect.The rest of the movie is a slow drag to pointlessness in a totally predictable scenario that tries (and fails) to offer you the usual ghost-jump scare that just isn't there anymore.Thank god for some partial-skin show for Miss Alba that at least satisfies our otherwise sore (due to the movie) eyes.I did watch it to the end though, to see if the little girl in the bus would be saved or not. Yey, another kid survived the horror movie...I slept easily afterwards. My accomplishment was being able to stay awake through it anyway.Avoid it, unless you're interested in post-medical surgery one in a million side-effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, as usual my hope was merely to be entertained and this did it for me. I'm sure there's a strong case for considering it inferior to the 'original', but it's not really a re-make anyway: it clearly says 'based upon' in the opening credits. My main pointer to fans of horror generally is that this doesn't really qualify as horror for me. To me, horror has to be more than just horror-related content (like ghosts or vampires) and the occasional 'jump' moment, there ought to be a build up of horrid suspense, leading to an equally horrid 'vision'. On the other hand, I wouldn't enjoy that, so I stick to this kind of film - the pointer is for others who might want more than that. Simply put, I would call this film a psychological chiller (e.g. like The Sixth Sense or Gothika) rather than horror.There are various 'jump' moments but little more than that in the way of scares. The photography is handled very well for the vehicle of 'delusion' that the main character falls into, and the mystery behind the whole premise unfolds nicely.Two things to conclude with: guys, watch out for the 'nude' shot of Alba (possibly the high point of the film!) and also (and I will be going looking for answers regardless), did anyone else see the red dots?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went in the cinema I didn'T knew anything about that movie. The poster didn't suggest that much. It's a story about a women who gets an eye transplant and from that moment she is able to see things that happened to the person whose eyes she now has. Also she sees death people... and she also sees the death who is carrying away the souls of them. For the second part, no explanation is given. Its some kind of gimmick to justify some action in the first hour of the movie...Although this movie is a remake of a Chinese movie (Gin Gwai, I haven'T seen that movie ...shame on me...), there are a lot of similarities to 6th sense (seeing death people) and also the Final Destination (the accident from FD 2, the whole story about the death seems to be copied and modified from this two movies) series. There isn't anything new in this movie. The lead role is occupied by Jessica Alba. I like her in Sin City, i didn't liked her in Fantastic Four (crap crap crap). She's a nice girls, no doubt, but as a blind violinist she isn't credible. Did you ever observe blind people? What I noticed is that most time they don'T wear make-up. In this movie Jessica lives alone in an apartment. Who put her the make-up on? Anyway, the movie had a few nice scary moments (actually just one...), and what i liked the most is how they visualized the ghost/death angel. When he/it appeared the first time i expected some kind of fight between Jessica and him, but it didn'T happen... They could have made the movie without the ghost too. It was just a visual clue that had no effects to the story... They should have done better. Her acting was mediocre, but nothing special. This role isn't definitely appropriate for her. I also didn't liked the acting of Alessandro Nivola. It was somehow boring.... no emotion. Maybe his character was written in that way... I don't know, the dialogues are boring and at times even stupid... The plot (at least for me) was sometimes confusing and had no clear structure. Even after seeing the movie some things remained unclear (not in a good sense like in Mullholland drive...) . Some things seem to didn'T fit in the movie. The ending was expectable. The last 15 minutes I was just waiting for what had to happen.If you don'T have anything (and I really mean ANYTHING) to do, than you can go to see this movie.

		<shortDescription>Review of The Eye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>well first off i will agree that this movie is by no means perfect i went into it with a open mind and i was quite surprised. i will say now i have not seen the original the eye so this one did not really have to live up to anything. i really thought Jessica Alba did a really good job playing the lead role. the atmosphere was great and even when you know something was going to happen i still had a scare. i admit i jumped about 5 times during this movie and the parts i did jump at totally caught me of guard. the plot was decent the acting was pretty good for Jessica even though i usually don't get my hopes up when i see her as the star role but she did a really good job. go see this with a open mind and you will not be disappointed its actually pretty good not great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At least it had quality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It reminded me a little too much of The Ring?as in, they ripped it off in structure?but overall it was okay. Nothing amazing, but a lot more quality than almost any other PG-13 horror movie I've seen. At least they showed the hanging scene, you know. Most other PG-13 horror movies would have cut off at that point, but this wasn't that cheap.They avoided all the obvious clichés I was sure they would use, which made me happy. They also focused more on daily life things than on the overdone horror elements. I think both these facts made it a lot more unnerving and mildly scary. It can't touch the Japanese original ghost movies, but what remake can other than The Ring? It really was not bad at all, but I'd most likely suggest the original, however.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not realistic. It was just OK.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I walked into the movie theater with my friend after my basketball game, expecting to end the night with a solid horror movie. The Eye seemed like the perfect choice.I was wrong. The eye, like others have said, could have been way better than it was. It was far-fetched, I mean, why the heck would someone want to drive all the way to Mexico that could cost him his working license?, Just for one person. Not realistic.Their were some good spurts of suspense and action, but otherwise, the movie just lingered on and on and on. Yes, I am only 13 years old, but I have seen movies like Hide and Seek, Halloween (all of them), etc. Those were amazing horrors. Kept me on the edge of my seat! But wow. This movie had some rather humorous lines. HAVE YOU SEEN MY REPORT CARD?! Um...OK then. That was just completely random and absolutely obnoxious.I would recommend this movie to a someone who is seeing a horror movie for the first time. This movie is nowhere near being frightening.a 5/10, because it had spurts of suspense, but it was just flat out not good enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sydney Wells(Jessica Alba) is blind since an accident when she was a child.She have hopes to get to see again after an eye transplant,but she soon realize something is wrong.Starting to see dead people and horrifying visions from the former owner brings here closer and closer to insanity.This is an American remake of the Asian smash-hit Pang Brothers Gin Gwai(The Eye) from 2002.I think The Eye remake is an alright movie but not anything more.It has a few jump scares and Jessica Alba does here acting good. If I have not seen the Asian one maybe I would have liked it more.Anyhowe its an OK time-waster,a solid movie with good special-effects and overall good acting(not any Oscar performance) and as I said surprisingly Jessica Alba is good as the lead actress.First movie in America for the French Directors David Moreau&amp;Xavier Palud with an OK result.Slightly recommended,I give the remake of The Eye 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While it's fine to see Jessica Alba star in her own picture and capably so, this obviously slick film is flawed by the heavy handed crash-bang-quick-cut-loud sound amateur technique that really belongs back in film school. Not having seen the Asian original I have nothing to compare it with except what I know about the horror film genre and film making in general. As the author of six books on film with one a first place national book festival prizewinner perhaps I have the right to get my two chips in.The horror genre is best handled psychologically and with subtle cleverness, not with gratuitous quick-cut crash-bang techniques that very quickly speak to inexperience and intellectual insolvency. Also we can suspend our disbelief for the plot engine here but when it comes to metaphysical ignorance represented by cartoonish depictions of death transitions that are accompanied by needlessly negative apparitions and fear characterized by excessive behavior instead of anguish we must wave this one off..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Like An Episode from Rod Serling's "Night Gallery"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm old enough to remember the night when NBC aired the pilot for Rod Serling's "Night Gallery." It was like a TV Movie with veteran motion picture stars in the various stories for the premiere of the new NBC network series. One of the stories was of an eye transplant, and horrors that followed. I'm a writer myself, and while it's been so many years since I've seen that "Night Gallery" episode, I call still see how that story and this screenplay share some plot points. I enjoyed that episode, and became a fan of the series. I also enjoyed this movie. A few times while I was watching it, I recalled watching the movie "Tequila Sunrise" with Michelle Pfiefer when that was originally in theaters. She had been so attractive in some of those scenes that it was almost distracting. I had to make a point to concentrate to follow the plot. It was like that for me today with Jessica Alba. I didn't want to get so caught up with the actress' beauty that I missed out on her fine dramatic performance. "The Eye" is much better than that episode of Rod Serling's "Night Gallery" that I saw on NBC a few decades ago. It should be. When you buy a ticket to a motion picture, you want better quality than network TV. "The Eye" with Jessica Alba is well worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****SPOILERS**** Nowhere as bad as you would think "The Eye" does have it's scary moments and the ending is as exciting as well as surprising as anything that you'll see in a horror/suspense movie coming out of Hollywood. Being a remake of the highly acclaimed 2002 Japanese thriller "Gin Gwai" you can't expect the film to outshine the original but surprisingly is some cases, with its fine special effects, it does.Jessica Alba as the blinded, and later having her vision restored, concert violinist Sydney Wells does a decent job of acting even though she comes out as wooden in some of the scenes in the film as the disembodied, yes Sydney sees dead people, spirits that she sees in it.After the operation on her eyes by renowned eye surgeon Dr. Haskins, Obba Babaturnd, turned out to be a complete success Sydney is assigned Dr. Paul Faulkner, Alessandro Nivola, to get her to not only see but understand what she's seeing. Sydney has been blind since a fireworks explosion took her sight away when she was five.It turns out that not only can Sydney see she sees things that nobody else notices like dead or soon to be dead people that greatly disturbs the sensitive young woman. At the hospital that she's convalescing in Sydney sees this angle of death or grim reaper taking away a number of people like Mrs. Hillman &amp; little Alicia, Karen Austin &amp; Chole Moretz, that she's acquainted with!Sydney's visions become more and more bizarre with her seeing fires break out wherever she's at like her apartment the hospital or a local Chinese restaurant that she dropped in to munch on a plate of spear ribs. There's also this ominous number that keeps popping up in Sydney's visions as well as on her bedroom clock 106 or 1:06 AM! What exactly does that number have to do with her visions about death and destruction!Determined to find out the source of her strange and terrifying visions Sydney asks her now good friend as well as personal physician Dr. Faulkner to help her find out who the donor of the corneas implanted in her eyes is! After thinking it over, he can lose his medical license if he does, Dr. Faulkner finally decides to reveal to Sydney her organ donor's identity; A young Mexican girl, much like herself, who committed suicide about a year ago named Ana Christina Martinez, Fernanda Romero.I's when Sydney together with Dr. Faulkner traveled to this little Mexican village where the late Ana Martinez lived that the truth finally came out to what see was seeing with Ana's, not her, eyes. Ana could not only see death in the faces of those about to depart this world she could also see death waiting in the wings ready to explode at any moment! The visions of fires wherever she goes the ominous number 106 showing up with the fires and the fact that Sydney is tormented day and night with both of them comes full circle at the Mexican/USA border crossing on her way back home from Mexico. The border has been closed holding up all the traffic coming into the USA because of the threat of a runaway car, with a bunch of Mexican car thieves, coming that way!***SPOILER ALERT***Heart-stopping final with Sydney together with Dr. Faulkner finally realizing what's about to happen and desperately trying to stop it. Ana from beyond her grave is trying to prevent a holocaust, like she was unable to do in real life before she committed suicide, in the making and is using the both very confused, until she finally got the massage, and emotionally drained Sydney Wells to do it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so i saw this movie on Saturday night, thinking id be a really scary flick. It wasn't. Actually, it was quite funny. I mean the whole theater was busting out laughing, and i just couldn't stop. Jessica Alba puts on a good performance, but the storyline is so funny that it doesn't matter. It does all make sense in the end(why she can see the dead), but still. The storyline has potential, but some of the things said in the movie are prepostraous, and just make you laugh. I only jumped once, because it tries too hard to be scary. I'm really hoping Scary Movie 5 spoofs this, because it definitely can. I would give it a 4/10, but because it's so funny, i give it a 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This had so much potential, but it unfortunately fell flat. A rental at best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jessica Alba stars in the new Asian horror remake "The Eye", and I am quite frankly disappointed with the overall outcome of the film as it is only a decent film. This movie could have been so much better, but it is instead a cliché-filled movie which feels the urge to put jump scares in practically every single scene to prove it is a horror film. It's a disappointing film overall seeing as the directors made the great french horror film "Them". This movie unfortunately doesn't cut it, but it does have a few redeeming qualities accompanied with it.Jessica Alba plays Sydney Wells, who is a blind woman and is having an eye transplant. However, after her eye transplant, Sydney begins to see dead people and tries to figure out what is happening to her and why she keeps seeing these things. Okay, I understand this is meant to be a film about ghosts...but seriously - what was with the constant screeching and ghosts popping up? It really started to grate on my nerves when this constant screeching noise was heard whenever a ghost appeared quite often. It didn't help that the movie was also littered with jump scares which were not scary, and a ton of clichés. It's a shame seeing as this seemed to be a really promising remake and the trailer looked awesome.I just don't understand why the film just because like this, because the film started off good and strong - it seemed promising and I was enjoying it. But then all of a sudden, we have some unlikeable characters thrown into the mix, clichés, jump-scares galore, annoying screeching and the movie is so predictable! It was easy to predict what was going to happen next, and when a jump scare would appear. This seemed to annoy me a lot and I started to loose interest and lost faith in the film less than half way through. It's not a good sign when you can't wait for a film to finish - especially one you've been anticipating.The Eye, however, has some really good acting. Jessica Alba gives one of her strongest performances to date - so don't listen to her haters who will bash the film just because of her. She has a likable character also, but for some strange reason her character seems to lose personality one second and then gain some back. Alessandro Nivola is good, but his character was arrogant and unlikeable. Parker Posey was great as usual, but her character needed much more screen time. Her character was a lot more likable than Nivola's, and she should have had his role in my opinion. Tamlyn Tomita and Rachel Ticotin also have roles and do really good, but they are wasted here and needed expanded characters. Tamlyn Tomita has an extremely pointless role of standing in an elevator for 2 seconds, getting out and then never being seen again. Such wasted talent.The Eye isn't all bad. It starts off good, has an interesting plot, good acting and I will say it does have a couple of creepy moments thrown in there. It's just the movie was overall disappointing, predictable and full of token jump scares and clichés. The directors needed to use less of these and expanded the story a little more, made it darker and less happier and overall made a better film than what they made! If had potential to be much better, and it's a shame I'm only giving this a rating of a 5. I'd suggest you don't listen to the Alba and Remake bashers as this movie isn't as bad as they make it out to be. It's a decent watch and was entertaining, but worth a rental first.5/10</fullReview>

Jessica Alba plays a girl named Cindy, which that means Scary Movie is going to make a spoof out of The Eye. The movie didn't drag to much, but there is something that is missing from this movie. That something I cant figure out. Acting- B/7 Direction- B/7 Visuals- B+/8 Story Line- B+/8 Overall- B/8 There was about 2-3 cups of blood used in the whole movie.

		<fullReview>Jessica Alba carried herself very well in this movie. Her characterization is very believable. This is definitely a tour d'force for her. The story is good and the supporting acting is also very believable. I have to question the violin playing coaching. Jessica's "playing" movements were very weak. The movement of the bow was totally unconvincing. She kept bowing up and down out of sync with the flow of the music. That is the fault of the coach. I've seen better fake violin and piano playing. But this is minor to the rest of the movie. As I said, Ms. Alba was wonderful in this film. The film itself had lots of great shocks and twists. When it comes out on DVD I am definitely buying it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sydney Wells, an accomplished violinist, is cool, calm, collected - and blind since the age of five years due to a firecracker accident. One day, after going through an eye transplant operation, she gets her sight back, but the new eyes give her more than what she had bargained for, as she can now not only see the natural world but the supernatural as well. Jessica Alba gives an effective, heartfelt performance as a young woman who undergoes the traumatic experience of reliving the horrifying end of the donor's life, night after night. She is able to convey her character's feelings of fear, doubt, rejection and empathy. While the original version of The Eye has tighter moments of suspense, this decent Hollywood take will be enough to satisfy those who are viewing this story for the first time.</fullReview>

Of course, I did not read the beginning few lines of the Wikipedia article that well, I was impressed. I know that many people complain that the acting was bad, but I can't really tell whether acting is bad or not. All I am able to judge is whether the plot looks cool. I like it how it has a happy ending, something that not all horror movies do. It is also nice because there is no retarded guy in a mask waving around a bloody machete and looking all fearsome and stuff.Okay fine, I have no clue what I am talking about.</fullReview>

Stick to comedy, Parker, you're at your best with the Christopher Guest movies (i.e, Best in Show, Waiting for Guffman, etc.). The story line verged on ridiculous, and there were a few loose ends left unexplained. Maybe a better editing job would have improved this movie. If you are a fan of the horror movie genre, I would give this movie a pass. There were a few good " jump in your seat" moments; but in general, this was a movie that didn't need to be made, the original Hong Kong production "Gin Gwai" was much creepier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I obviously saw the original Asian version of the film, and I thought it was very good, I was certainly interested to see if this American remake would be like The Ring, just as good as the original. Basically successful classical violinist Sydney Wells (Jessica Alba) has been blind since an accident at the age of five, but she may finally be able to see again as she is to undergo a cornea transplant. Her eyesight does return, at first blurry, and she has to get used to seeing everything as it is all fascinating and distracting, but soon enough there is something strange happening. With her newfound sight Sydney has started seeing terrifying visions and things that no one else can see, including invisible spirits, and a fire with people dying, and she is sure that it is something to do with the person who owned the eyes before. Dr. Paul Faulkner (Jurassic Park III's Alessandro Nivola) her visual therapist is for a while very insistent that she just has to get used to seeing things having been blind for so many years, but he does eventually help her in a quest to find out more about the eye donor and what she saw. The donor came from Mexico, and she does eventually conclude the reasons she can see these horrible things, but it is only when it looks like it is all over that she realises why she is seeing a horrific fire and people dying, it is a premonition. In the end the vision comes true as a high speed chase sees the chased car crash into a gasoline tanker, all the people, including the little girl mostly seen, are saved, but shattering glass blind Sydney again, but she returns to a peaceful life blind again and playing the violin with optimism for life. Also starring Scream 3's Parker Posey as Helen Wells, Rade Serbedzija as Simon McCullough, Fernanda Romero as Ana Christina Martinez, Total Recall's Rachel Ticotin as Rosa Martinez, Obba Babatundé as Dr. Haskins, Danny Mora as Miguel and Kick-Ass's Chloë Grace Moretz as Alicia. I agree Alba is a little bit wooden, and she did get a Razzie nomination along with her part in The Love Guru, but she looks the part, and she looks terrified enough in the right moments, the story is pretty much exactly the same as the original, it was freaky in moments, so it's not a bad remake supernatural horror thriller. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all know it is a remake of the Chinese horror movie. I did not watch the original version. I watch it just to see more of my favorite actress, Jessica Alba. The plot seems slow and I had difficulties watching the first half an hour. I thought it would be thrilling and heck, it was not. The ghosts appearance are predictable. Once a ghost appears, there is talking and then in the next scene, another ghost appears and this continues. It is not bad but it is still not good. I did not really feel the suspense.The story: Jessica Alba acts as Sydney Wells, she received eye transplant and she can see a bit but soon as the plot unfolds, she starts seeing ghosts and spirits. And she starts screaming. She then take up the courage to find whose eyes she had. This is all for the story. It is disappointing yet I had a bit of fun watching it. I can't really call it a horror movie but a mystery movie.Overall: It is another remake of another Asian horror movie. They always use the pretty actress to star in it. It does have its moments and that is all. Jessica Alba and the good moments scenes are not enough to change the story. If you like watching remakes, I guess this is another remake that light up your way. I like remakes, they are not bad but it depends on what I am watching.</fullReview>

In this case Jessica Alba portraits a blind woman who get a cornea transplant giving her the gift of sight...plus a little more than she bargained for. Now I'll admit "The Eye" had a more structure to it then something like "The Grudge" and its god awful sequel but when it comes right down to it there's nothing new here. Now if the directors had put in the effort to firstly, change the creatures so they don't look like every other monster in the book. And secondly give some more back story to it, we meet Alba, find out she's blind then 5 minutes later she's seeing ghosts. There was on the other hand one scene I really liked where she's playing the violin along with a symphony. More of that, more character development and maybe, just maybe this movie would be more respectable and people over 14 could enjoy it. **</fullReview>

Everything that worked in this was directly lifted from the original, everything else... didn't.The director tries to built tension in places where none exists. The screen writer tries to "improve" on the mystery of the original but the results don't work, giving itself away from he very first "vision". The acting was below par for most of the cast, with characters coming off as two dimensional for the sake of moving the plot along- and Jessica Alba needs to realize she gets film jobs for her looks not her talent.Anyway, if you're thinking of watching this, don't. It's not scary. It's not suspenseful. It's not even original. It's a waste of your time and money. Rent the original or watch another film instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Female violinist Sydney Wells was blinded as a child by a firecracker . Receiving a cornea transplant she regains her eyesight . Any joy at this is soon outlived by demonic visions she starts experiencing . Is she suffering mental illness or is there a more supernatural reason at play ? THE EYE is a Hollywood remake of a 2002 Hong Kong chiller which I haven't seen and so can't compare to this remake . This shouldn't have any bearing since a remake should stand on its own hind legs and as a supernatural chiller THE EYE is moderately scary . That is until you realise it startles its audience by using every cliché in the book especially the sound mix where the film is silent for a couple of seconds then BANG a loud noise causes the audience to jump out of their seats . It is effective though it's a pretty cheap trick but considering Sydney has had a cornea transplant why does her sense of hearing suddenly become so sensitive ? I guess you're not supposed to think about this too much And this is a film you're not supposed to think about . We're shown grotesque shadows leading the dead off to a probable afterlife and this ties in with the original donor having second sight but again if you stop to think about it the whole concept seems nonsensical if you examine it in depth . Surely having a clairvoyant ability to foretell death is down to more than just eyesight ? Surely other parts of the brain is involved ? Perhaps I'm over analyzing the plotting but the whole tone and pompous mood of the film draws attention to itself to its own detriment</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst remake ever even fathomed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not even being harsh.. This is a disgrace to the original. The first time I heard they were making an American version I was skeptical but I didn't know it was going to star Jessica Alba. Other than her acting I was just plain disappointed with the movie's horror. I have two questions: Did the director/writer even watch the original movie? And why do Americans need to remake Japanese horror movies? It's like admitting that we don't have any imagination left to think up a scary film that isn't a hack and slash movie about violence and sex. We have even resorted to remaking comics, T.V. shows, foreign films, and classic movies into cheesy remakes. I am disappointed in the film industry as of late.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does its part very well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've got to say that I really liked this movie. Yes, it's not something superior or great but I rated it with 10 starts because it does its part very well. It is very entertaining and surprisingly spooky as well. Jessica Alba plays a very likable character that you get to like instantly. Overall the acting is very good from everyone. The girl that plays the donor and looks like Jessica Alba's sister Fernanda Romero does a very good job, although her parts are in Spanish I liked how you get to understand her through her emotions.I think though that they could have extended the donors story a bit more so we could understand the story better. Anyway if you wanna see something entertaining go see this movie, its good fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never good when the bulk of a movie's core story is 10 seconds of narration rather filming the drama.Maybe a little subtler but commercially this is another sexploitation film. Weak sexploitation at that. Still it obvious the film wouldn't make it to DVD with an ugly or completely uninteresting looking woman as star. The subconscious savagery appeal to men is that, through most the movie Alba appears as a beautiful woman so crazy and helpless that she would be unable to defend her virtue or effectively report when you take advantage of her. For women the appeal is identification with a woman having justification for masturbatory self-absorption, a fantasy return to youthful attention seeking. Alba's character gets "daddy"-like attention from her supporting doctor without the film ever providing any good reason.Sure the film has other messages but unfortunately these are too weakly presented to be the basis for commercial appeal. The supernatural element of the source story is basically all but lost. See the TV show "Ghost Whisper" if you want to add a supernatural story to the sexploitation (and better sexploitation for men too).How does the film fail so badly? Well the real story is confined to the last 30 minutes. First the movie spends 25 minutes of "action" in an extremely slow setup before the first hint of entering the main idea. So you know more than you need to about life before the eye surgery. Lots of stalker appeal I guess. I think that they tried to let the story develop Blair Witch style though with professional cinematography. Of course Blair Witch is a "unedited bad home video evidence" idea that is really only interesting once -- at least viewing end to end.The slow setup might be because the rest of the movie has so little to say. The movie spends way too much time in blurry vision mode. It takes 20 minutes for normal stuff to come into focus. She doesn't see everything clear until around 55 minutes into the film. I guess this is to encourage you to believe the main character is nuts because she jumping around way before you can see a reason for it. In fact this film ought to be called "The Ear" because for 2/3 the time she is hearing stuff far more than seeing it.The writing and directing is so bad that I think most people would have problems figuring out what the big deal was from the first 60 minutes, if they hadn't heard the movie synopsis before seeing the film. At least not until the character tells you something with only 30 minutes to go. Oh there are a couple fuzzy hints earlier but nothing definite. Then a support character reveals the bulk of the story in 2-3 sentences with only 20 minutes left in the movie. Then you get the first validation of the main character's reality a minute later...not good timing, especially as it has never really been questioned until this point. There is only 10-15 minutes left in the film before there is a hint that the main character has a goal or something to resolve -- and it still isn't clear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake of a Japanese supernatural take on an American movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen either this movie or the Japanese one yet, but I am surprised no one has mentioned the American movie from 1994 that predates both this and the Japanese one. It was called "Blink." It was actually a decent movie and the leads were quite good (Madeline Stowe and Aidan Quinn). It did not have the supernatural twist that this one appears to have, but it also features a blind woman who is a violinist (in a band not an orchestra) who gets a corneal implant and sees weird things because of the transition from blindness to vision. Given so many common points, it seems impossible to me that the Japanese writers did not know anything of the American "Blink" (which frankly is much more intelligent than either of these appear to be since the science in Blink is actually feasible).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jessica Alba Kills Another Movie Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jessica Alba's complete lack of acting skills is pretty obvious to everyone, except apparently movie producers.Maybe it's because they're blinded by the countless photographs she takes in various conditions of undress.Regardless, here again she gives yet another frightfully bad performance. So bad that you can't really even call it a performance.Jessica Alba was born to be a bikini model and that's exactly what she should do. She shouldn't act, but if she really feels she must, she could at least take some acting lessons.The Eye will die, like all Alba movies, because of her complete lack of talent and skill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot see how you people think this movie is horrible!!!!! You people pay attention to the plot and other stuff while you should be paying attention to the movie itself. Jessica Alba can act and people that say she cant are just really jealous that they cant do anything and are just sitting around hating on all these actors and movies!! The Eye was a great film!!!! It was scary, funny, and had action! Whoever says that this movie isn't worth your money. Please!!!! This movie is the total bomb and therefore you should watch it. Yes, its a thriller and its really good and don't hate on Jessica Alba because she is very sexy and she can act way better then those people say she cant.She is a really good actor. I don't see what was so wrong about the plot. The movie was meant to be scary; not for nerds to judge every little detail about the movie and also just because some of you people cant understand Spanish doesn't make the movie bad. It makes it even better!!!! This movie is a thumbs-up all the way!!!!</fullReview>
