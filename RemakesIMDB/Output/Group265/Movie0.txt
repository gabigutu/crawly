		<shortDescription>Classy Annie Giradot vehicle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best since FEUX DE LA CHANDELEUR of that string of French romantic outings that Giradot offered her fans for a couple of decades ? Soft color Paris location, nice Delerue score, beautiful people. These were the mother lode in frogflix till the vision began to darken into SOUND AND FURY and LA HAINE.Widowed Annie (`No woman has more freedom than I') works though a selection of suitors with her supportive children commenting. Rivera is particularly effective. Her so nice yoghurt eating Boss Dux (from Z) adds comfort.Backing the accomplished film making there's a nicely cynical tone - `A girl should use ear plugs the moment any man says he loves her.'</fullReview>
