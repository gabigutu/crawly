		<shortDescription>Fascinating non-Hollywood style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am familiar with Kurosawa's "Rashomon", which is original work interestingly remade in Hollywood by Martin Ritt. Those who have seen both works will be able to note the obvious virtues of the original. Yet, I saw this film with no prior knowledge of the fact that this was a remake of Rashomon.What struck me within minutes of opening of the film was the unusual camerawork of James Hong Howe, that takes pleasure in close-ups and tilted shots that are reminescent of European cinema of the sixties. It is so far removed in style from Hollywood.Reams of paper have used to write about Akutagawa's story immortalized by Kurosawa. So I have nothing to add on the brilliant story that obviously attracted Ritt and the playwrights Kanin.What is unusual is Ritt's treatment. His choice of actors are interesting--Claire Bloom is a fine choice as she has a range of emotions to display with credibility; Laurence Harvey's role is limited even though he occupies a long screentime gagged and bound but he has to show scorn for a brief period the gag is removed without speaking--and when he speaks his face is not visible; Edward G Robinson is a perfect choice for a snake oil salesman and so on...Ritt's use of the soundtrack is again non-Hollywood in style. He uses music and uses silence with great effect while characters talk to underline the emotions. Kurosawa did it to the extreme limits that makes it odd for the non-Japanese viewer.Ritt is an interesting director. I have always admired his choice of subjects to film. I prefer his black and white films to his color projects because of the subjects that he chose to film--"Edge of the City" being one of my favorite Ritt works. The second reason I admire him is for his choice of actors, especially for the major female roles. He has derived great performances as he did here with Bloom.This film will never be talked about because it is a remake of a classic. However, in my view it stands out as unlike John Sturges' "Magnificent Seven," which was also a remake of another Kurosawa work in Hollywood, this film adopted a different style closer to Europe and Japan. It is essentially a fine work of depicting a play on film somewhat like nuggets of celluloid gold found among the works of the American Film Theatre series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Newman, can you see him?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Newman plays a Mexican bandit so convincingly in "The Outrage" (Martin Ritt, 1964) that it's extremely difficult to recognize Newman at all. Far from being a star vehicle, the Paul Newman "persona" isn't recognizable here in the least. I must admit that for quite a while, I kept wondering when Newman was going to finally arrive on the screen, before it dawned upon me that Newman was playing the bandit. I wouldn't deem his amoral, animalistic, lusty performance brilliant because it constitutes a rather stereotypical caricature of a Mexican bandit. Nevertheless, Newman disguises himself so dramatically, to the point where "Paul Newman" is almost invisible, that his performance becomes noteworthy just the same.Overall, Martin Ritt's Western remake of Akira Kurosawa's landmark and legendary "Rashomon" (Kurosawa, 1950) is worth viewing despite some obvious flaws. Ritt doesn't add anything new to Kurosawa's famous study in subjective truth and point-of-view prejudice, and at times, "The Outrage," which was also taken from a then-recent Broadway play, appears a bit flat and copied. Indeed, it occasionally seems as if Ritt grows bored with the story that he's copying from Kurosawa and Broadway and that he's yearning for comedy and satire in his otherwise straight remake. However, those alternative tones are never fully developed and as a result the film fails to make a dynamic impact. That same year, over in Spain, Italian director Sergio Leone remade Kurosawa's Samurai classic "Yojimbo" (1961) as a Western, but he did so with epochal results, largely because he brought a whole new visual style (a patient, rhythmic balance of stunning panorama and extreme close-ups) and directorial slant (a fluid study in operatic nihilism and surrealism) to Kurosawa's story. In other words, Leone remade a Kurosawa film and in doing so, he transformed it into something vastly different. In "The Outrage," Ritt fails to pull off the same trick.That said, there are some aspects that recommend "The Outrage" to the viewer, and Newman's chameleon performance is just one of them. All of Ritt's remarkable directorial trademarks are on display here: his ambiguity; his objectivity; his refusal to condescend to the audience; the moral shadiness that he evokes; his rejection of black-or-white moral simplicity; his implicit and unstrained social commentary (in this case revolving around the holy trinity of race, class, and gender, not to mention regionalism); his spare, ominously striking visuality; his meditative pacing. Perhaps most noteworthy is James Wong Howe's haunting black-and-white cinematography, which reflects an ominous glow and projects an apocalyptic sensibility rather than Western grandeur. Instead of macrocosmic vistas, Howe's compositions capture a sense of claustrophobia, moral confusion, and subjective truth thanks to their low-angle and eye-level confinement. Through his camera-work, the Western landscape becomes not a romantic frontier or an open-air arena, but instead an entangling thicket where honor and honesty descend in a squalid ravine. Most remarkable are the crepuscular, stormy, forbidding shots of a forsaken railway station during a desert thunderstorm. It is here that three observers (one of which is deliciously played by the always memorable Edward G. Robinson) discuss the different versions of truth while refraining from spelling out the implications for the audience. Ritt, as usual, forces the viewer to think for him or herself. And what Ritt reveals are the human motivations?pride, vanity, contempt, guilt, shame, distrust, lust, cowardice, avarice, survival?that color the notion of truth and ultimately render it subjective. Unfortunately, as a straight remake, "The Outrage"'s presentation of these themes is a little too flat and perfunctory to leave a fresh impact. Still, the film is compelling and curious, standing as an artistic, sobering Western and the most obscure oater that Paul Newman ever starred in. And of course, Newman virtually obscures himself by becoming another.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the last of the "intellectual" B westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If John Sturges made "Seven Samurai" as an A western, and Sergio Leone "Yojimbo" as a spaghetti western, Martin Ritt chose the B western for "Rashomon", in "The Outrage". It follows the path set by "The Ox-Bow Incident", "The Gunfighter", "The Showdown" and "High Noon", the "intellectual" western in black and white. The story is excellent and adapts well for the genre, with four people telling different versions of the same murder. Claire Bloom and Lawrence Harvey are the married couple who get assaulted by Carrasco (Newman). Paul Newman is a great actor, his performance in Martin Ritt's "Hombre" is a proof of that, but there is a limit on how far you can go acting against your type. Newman set an impossible task for himself playing Carrasco, that part should go for actors like Eli Wallach or Anthony Quinn. I would not say his performance is a total failure, but the problem is that it is very important to understand Carrasco's character and that is not achieved by Newman visually, only when he verbalizes it in a Spanish that does not sound right. The irony is that Newman is such a charismatic actor that you actually enjoy his presence in the film. Edward G Robinson is the Con Man, what a performance! "The Outrage" is a very good film, it deserved better reviews than it got from the critics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comparison of objective and subjective reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remarkable 1964 film has many virtues, among them a strong script, fine photography, and a pre-Kirk William Shatner (whose idiosyncratic acting style is already well-developed, however).The story is a Westernization of "Rashomon", the story of a rape and murder told from the points of view of three participants and an outsider. The contrast between the subjective stories (told by the bandit, the husband, and the wife) and the story told by the miner who witnesses what really happens is both hilarious and thought provoking.Everyone is in fine form, but DaSilva's miner and Edward G. Robinson's snake oil salesman are especially fine. Newman's portrayal of the Mexican bandit is often over-the-top, but always interesting.This is one of those movies that makes one wonder if Mr. Maltin saw the same thing. I think that it is one of the better films of the 60's, a decade that produced a great many of the best movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic. Period.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes, I'm amazed at the low level of commentary on these films. This one is no exception. The reviewer opening these comments comments on a "Western" as if this were a Roy Rogers or Gene Autry oater. While I'm aware that we all have the right to express our views, I would like to see a little more insight on those selecting which reviews will be presented. This film is a remake and reset of the Kurusawa classic and is a classic in its own right. Fine, fine performances are given by Newman, Harvey, Bloom, Shatner(in his pre-Kirk days), Robinson, Salmi, Da Silva and Fix in this casting of a Japanese film play-- which is a composite of two stories, BTW-- by Akira Kurusawa. It's not perfect. The role of the medium, the old Indian shaman portrayed by veteran character actor, Paul Fix, doesn't have the cultural impact of the original. There is confusion around the rape and fight scene, but these are small things. The film is marvelous and the black and white setting captures much of the shading and light contrasts of the original Rashomon. The story in both films, which Kurusawa wove out of two earlier stories, is full of archetypes but lacking much of the impending chaos of the original. The first tale of the old gate at kyoto tells of a ronin confronting an old woman and taking the blanket from an abandoned child in the time of civil war and political upheaval; the other tale, in the woods, tells of the various versions of rape, murder, honor and shame, told by each of the participants. Kurusawa blended them into an excellent film story. While the cultural background of the original sets it apart from this American version, there is much that does make it work. The genteel Southern couple, the Mexican bandido, the pragmatic sheriff, the country preacher, the snake-oil salesman and the miner/prospector, fit the Samurai, bandit, medium, etc., of the original very well. So, face it. It ain't John Wayne. But it's good cinema at it best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Newman deserves credit for trying something boldly unusual?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Newman's fifth film for Martin Ritt, "The Outrage" was based on the classic Japanese film "Rashômon," but Ritt transplanted the tale to the South Western U.S. following the Civil War? Carrasco has been convicted of raping a woman (Claire Bloom) and murdering her husband (Laurence Harvey), but four eye-witness accounts conflict? All agree that the bandit raped the woman, but only one asserts that he committed the killing? Sadistic, defiant, and challenging, Carrasco snarls, sneers, and walks with macho arrogance, to hide the fact that he can only be strong by tying a man to a tree and raping his wife? The role allowed Newman to give a bravura performance, not unlike Toshiro Mifune's in the Kurosawa film, and the stylization would fit the story if everybody else weren't playing it so straight? As it is, the performance seems too showy, easily understandable, exaggerated?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enigmatic remake making waves in some cinephiles quarters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Martin Ritt, The Outrage is a remake of the 1950 Akira Kurosawa film Rashomon, that in turn is based on stories by Ry&#x16b;nosuke Akutagawa, but Ritt has reformulated it in a Western setting. It stars Edward G. Robinson, Paul Newman, Laurence Harvey, Claire Bloom, Howard Da Silva &amp; William Shatner. The story remains the same as four people give contradictory accounts of a rape and murder during the trial of Mexican bandit Juan Carrasco (Newman). The story is told within a flashback framework of three men waiting for a train at a rain soaked Southwestern station-a prospector (Da Silva), a con man (Robinson) and a preacher now struggling with his faith in humanity (Shatner). As each story is told the validity of each account comes under scrutiny, could it be there was a gross miscarriage of justice at the trial?Perhaps unsurprisingly, this remake of a well regarded classic was a commercial flop, with many front line critics particularly savage in their reviews. Which while acknowledging it's a long way away from style and tone of Kurosawa's movie, it's hardly the devil's spawn either. Solidly constructed by Ritt and potently shot in black &amp; white by James Wong Howe (vistas however are in short supply), the story is strong enough to make for an interesting social conscious Oater. There's some misplaced humour in the final third, and a charge of overacting from the talented cast is fair enough (especially Bloom); but maybe, just maybe, Ritt and his team deserve a little leeway for trying a different approach? I mean at least it's not a shot for shot remake eh?Certainly Newman could never be accused of not being bold or daring with his role selections, one only has to look at his Western film's to see that. Especially the three he did with Ritt: Hud (1963), The Outrage (1964) &amp; Hombre (1967), three very different roles, and each of a different ethnicity too. Throw in his intense turn as Billy The Kid in Arthur Penn's The Left Handed Gun, and it makes a mockery of those people who pop up from time to time proclaiming Newman had limited range! Is he miscast as Bandido Carrasco in The Outrage? No not really, he throws himself into the role and without prior knowledge of whose under the hat, it's not overtly evident it's the great blue eyed man performing. Sure a Mexican actor would have been better for the role, and definitely Rashomon wasn't in need of a remake. But for Western fans, and especially for fans of Newman, The Outrage still has enough to warrant spending a pie and a pint of beer with. Not particularly great, but not exactly bad either. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Stagey and Theatrical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is amazing that Martin Ritt and Paul Newman made this film between their two masterpieces "Hud" and "Hombre". It seems that they should have known that the stage acting that Newman was doing would not be effective on film. In stage acting, you play broad and loud because the 23rd row has to see and hear you. In film you can adjust the volume and go in for the close-up to make sure the slightest gesture gets shown. For whatever strange reason, everybody, with the exception of super-old pro Edward G. Robinson, is doing stage acting. It comes across as over-the-top and ridiculous most of the time. The acting seriously undercuts the serious metaphysical questions about truth that the plot raises.Newman's performance matches his worse performance in "From the Terrace," although, I haven't seen him in "the Silver Chalice" (allegedly his worse). He reminded me of the 1960's cartoon commercial character for Frido's Corn Chips, "the Frido Bandido." He has on heavy stage make-up, so he is hardly recognizable, and his accent sounds quite fake. The real problem is that this is not a leading man role, but a role for a character actor. There were probably hundreds of out of work Spanish speaking actors in Hollywood at this time who could have done the role better.William Shatner isn't playing to the 23rd row, he is playing to the 46th row. As a priest who has lost his faith, he has one pained look throughout the movie. One of the nice things about Shatner is how relaxed and animated he is in all his roles, from the Twilight Zone to Star Trek to Boston Legal. Here he is the opposite: restrained to the point of being a cartoon cut-out.Claire Bloom and Laurence Harvey also give mundane and forgettable performances.For cinema fans this is worth seeing because it is a Martin Ritt film and he was a terrific director. However, like every great director, he had his misfires, and this is one of them. It is watchable, but much more should have been delivered considering the classical source material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>some films just don't need to be re-made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Outrage" is a re-make of the Akira Kurosawa classic "Rashomon." It's a very faithful adaptation but does not improve upon the original. It would have been better served not to have been as faithful as it was. The cinematography of "Rashomon," for instance, is groundbreaking and an all-time great. Martin Ritt's remake is slicker and more modern but not better. "Outrage" is set in the old west, where the original was set in feudal Japan. Four years before "Outrage," director John Sturges remade Kurosawa's `Seven Samurai' into "The Magnificent Seven." Both are classics. Ritt's stab at Kurosawa (a slightly older film) has been swept up into the sands of film history and is little-remembered. This despite an all-star cast that includes Edward G. Robinson, Laurence Harvey, William Shatner, and Paul Newman as (agh!) a Mexican outlaw. The source material for "Magnificent Seven" is a story and a script written for film. The source material for "Outrage" technically is a short story written in the early 20th century by Ryunosuke Akutagawa called "In A Grove," from which "Rashomon" was also adapted. Oddly, `Rashomon' is another story altogether, by the same author. The Rashomon Gate is the largest entrance to the walled, then-capital of Japan, Kyoto. Having chosen this the setting for the telling of the film's story, as the three souls take refuge from a storm under this giant gate, Kurosawa re-named the film after it. Instead of going back to the original source, Ritt remakes Kurosawa's film. In doing so, Ritt walks into a trap many filmmakers do when trying to faithfully remake a much-loved piece of work. To remake a film seems to convey that the original lacked something or was somehow flawed. "Rashomon" clearly did not need to be re-made. But once the decision was made to make another version, whether Ritt used the film or the Akutagawa story as his source, it's a no-win situation. Even if he'd based it on the original story, he would have spent his time and energy trying NOT to make another version of "Rashomon." There are humorous moments in both films. More times than not, I could not tell the difference between what was funny intentionally or unintentionally in "Outrage." One possible improvement that is made by the remake is that the fourth and final re-telling of the trial by the thief, distinguishes itself much more from the first telling, by the bandit. It comes off more comically, which I believe was intended in Kurosawa's version, but doesn't quite come across. The sequence, taken by itself, is the high point of "Outrage." All things considered, "The Outrage" is an exercise in futility. It's a curiosity for those wondering how yet another Kurosawa film could be overhauled and made into a western. I'd guess the idea was to bring the same story to America, with a more familiar setting, in English. Maybe someday directors will quit wasting their time trying to re-make films that are already masterpieces. If you really feel you need to do a re-make, find a bad film and rise to the challenge of improving upon it (example: Christopher Nolan's "Insomnia"). With "Rashomon," there was nowhere to go but down. The one exception is the aforementioned "Magnificent Seven." By Kurosawa's own admission, the inspiration for his "Seven Samurai" came from the American western genre. It's for this reason that Sturges' remake works so well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without knowing it before hand, as soon as the movie started I had a definite feeling that this was a remake of the 1950 Kurosawa film "Rashomon". I thought the opening scene was great, almost like a horror movie in some respects with the sinister storm and dark atmosphere. Within moments characters portrayed by William Shatner, Howard da Silva and Edward G. Robinson appear on screen, whetting my appetite for an effectively offbeat story. Robinson's character is described as the 'Con Man' and probably has the best dialog in the picture when he's challenging what passes for status quo thinking in the Old West of the 1870's.I had to go back and read my own review of the "Rashomon" picture because I knew there was something that bothered me about it when I first saw it. Kurosawa's pacing is sometimes too laborious for me, though it surprised me that this treatment was actually a few minutes longer. And for anyone who thinks Paul Newman's performance as the bandit Carracas is over the top, you'll really have to see Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune. His characterization of the bandit Tajomaru is so manic it makes Newman's role look tame by comparison.In most other respects, the story is almost exactly the same, with the three principals involved in the murder of a Southern gentleman and the rape of his wife all telling a different story. Told in a flashback style among the characters who opened the picture, one is constantly left questioning which of the narratives is valid, and whether the people involved have a spark of dignity or honor among them. This carries right through to the finale when the old prospector (Da Silva) is hauled up short by the Con Man for being as disreputable as the ones who testified at the trial of Carracas.I guess if one has the means to do so, you might try watching both films one after the other. When I first watched "Rashomon" I had to rewind some scenes for clarification as the characters seemed more esoteric and difficult to follow. I didn't have the same reaction to "The Outrage", but that could be because I already knew the basic story. I also have a preference for Westerns, so that's part of the equation as well. Both pictures merit the same rating by my count, though for it's more familiar players, I prefer this Martin Ritt directed version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Initially intriguing, though overwrought, but ultimately pointless and silly.A Hollywood adaptation of Akira Kurosawa's "Rashomon". Three men meet at a deserted station in the middle of nowhere. Soon their discussion turns to the trial that occurred in the nearby town the previous say. The trial concerned the death of a man. Three people claim they killed him, and we see their version of the events. Who is correct and why are two of them (at least...) lying?From the outset there is a degree of unnecessary complexity about the script. The script is overly wordy, almost to the point of being Shakespearean, and feels padded. The plot is quite interesting but as it goes on it becomes less and less plausible, and feels complex just for the sake of it. Soon the holes appear, none of which are filled in by the end of the movie.After a point the implausibility and complexity have descended into farce. The last few scenes are quite silly and ultimately you're left wondering what the point was and even possibly what the story was...The casting provides some interesting appearances. Paul Newman puts in a good, almost over-the-top, performance as the Mexican bandit. William Shatner is there, as a preacher (two years later Star Trek started...). Edward G Robinson gets the role of the verbose swindler (he is largely responsible for my "Shakespearean" comment). Laurence Harvey and Claire Bloom put in reasonably solid performances as the married couple. To be honest, even though many regard Rashomon as a classic, I don't. The plot for The Outrage demonstrates why Rashomon is overrated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If one forgets that Rashomon (1950) exists, then The Outrage (1964) is a great film. Unfortunately, Rashomon does exist and TO is a standard remake that adds no new insights to the story or characters. I wouldn't call it a shot-for-shot remake, but it's pretty close.On its own merits, this is a good drama. The cinematography is beautiful and fluid. Alex North's melancholy score effectively underscores the action, never once intruding upon the proceedings. All the actors are great, and even the often-criticized Paul Newman does a good job as the bandit. Claire Bloom is absolutely marvelous as the wife, giving an intense and ambiguous performance that comes close to rivaling Machiko Kyo's in the original film.An enjoyable movie, but it really didn't need to be made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Outrage, The (1964) ** (out of 4) Paul Newman and Edward G. Robinson stars in this American remake of Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon. In the film, a man is left dead but there are three different versions as to how he was killed yet none of them might be the truth. I personally think Kurosawa's film is a masterpiece and one of the greatest films ever made but I was interested in this remake to see what they'd do. In all honesty, this film is extremely lazy in all forms. Newman plays a Mexican bandit who is the prime suspect in the murder of a rich man (Laurence Harvey). It's strange that Newman would be so busy in the Civil Rights movement at the time this was released yet he didn't have a problem playing a painted Mexican. His performance is actually pretty good with the exception of his accent, which comes across so thick that it's hard to understand at times. Some stereotypical "Mexican dialogue" doesn't serve too well though. Harvey is also good in his role as is Claire Bloom who plays his wife. Robinson is an old con man who hears the three different stories from people at a train station. I think an American remake could have worked but this isn't the film. The movie is lazy from start to finish and that includes some stupid Indian customs thrown in to try and make the film more mystical.</fullReview>

A preacher, a con-man, and an old-timer rehash the recent conviction of a notorious Mexican bandit, deemed guilty of killing a newlywed traveler and raping his wife. Gimmick of the differing accounts preceding the crime provides the only interest; the characters, the literate but prosy dialogue, and the over-worked performance of a miscast Paul Newman as the mustachioed bandito are each in their own way utterly false. James Wong Howe's striking black-and-white cinematography provides an appropriately moody feel, and Alex North delivers yet another of his fabulous music scores, but the picture isn't intrinsically exciting--it alienates the audience. The various brutalities are gripping, though rather uncomfortable to watch (due to director Martin Ritt's sensationalist staging), while the final summation is muddled and unsatisfying. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

It wasn't as bad as I expected. I agree with an earlier comment that the final "re-telling" is pretty funny.I teach "Rashomon" in my History of Film course. I realize that many western students just can't fully appreciate much of the Japanese culture packed into Kurosawa's work. I'd love to figure a way to show "Rashomon" and "The Outrage" back-to-back. The better students might appreciate the artistry of Kurosawa a bit more; the lunk-heads might finally figure out what was going on. At least a couple of idiots each term seem to think the wife and the medium in "Rashomon" are the same woman.

Michael Kanin's screenplay retained the outline of the Japanese film, but moved the locale to the American Old West. Three men at a deserted railroad station discuss a recent incident between a Mexican outlaw and a genteel Southern couple, while they await a late-arriving train. A rape and a death had occurred, but the facts differ vastly among the four versions told by the participants and an observer.Ritt assembled a stellar cast that included not only Newman, but Claire Bloom, Laurence Harvey, Edward G. Robinson, William Shatner, Howard Da Silva, and Paul Fix. Unfortunately, only Robinson excels as a con man waiting with Shatner and Da Silva for the train. A hammy Newman overplays the outlaw, Carrasco, with a thick Frito-Bandito accent in a role better suited for Anthony Quinn. Claire Bloom, whose perfect make-up never fails her in the desert heat, gives a stagy performance as though auditioning for the part of Blanche DuBois. Harvey and Shatner are, well, Harvey and Shatner, wooden. Shatner in particular, plays the preacher, who intones every line as though imparting Great Words of Wisdom from on high. Aided in no small part by Shatner, "The Outrage" plods along sluggishly and makes the relatively short running time seem endless.The film's greatest asset is James Wong Howe's elegant Oscar-worthy black-and-white cinematography. Howe's carefully composed shots of landscapes, textures, and faces are worthy of being framed and hung alongside the work of great Western photographers. However, beyond the cinematography, a spare score by Alex North, and Robinson's lively performance, "The Outrage" is slow ponderous going. Die-hard Newman fans will want to make a campy double feature of this with "The Silver Chalice," but serious students of Kurosawa best return to the original masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good attempt at remake of Akira Kurosawa's iconic Rashômon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A disillusioned preacher (William Shatner) is abandoning Silver Gulch after a trial of a despicable crime. A scruffy prospector (Howard Da Silva) finds him waiting at train station. A con man (Edward G. Robinson) sleeping there join them at recounting the events leading to the trial. Mexican bandit Juan Carrasco (Paul Newman)'s encounter with husband Wakefield (Laurence Harvey) and wife Nina (Claire Bloom) had ended with the husband's death and the raping of the wife. The couple was leaving the post war south. An old Indian shaman (Paul Fix) performs a séance at the trial using the spirit of the dead man.It's a reimagining of Akira Kurosawa's iconic Rashômon in the old west. This is definitely not the traditional western which probably confused some people at the time. It just happens to take place in the old west. Paul Newman is almost unrecognizable as a Mexican bandit. He's pushed to the limit with such a vast range of an unlikely role. The acting is all first rate. This is an engaging film throughout. The slapstick humor and the mannerisms in the last act doesn't quite fit. Overall, it's a good attempt at a remake. Even Newman's brownface didn't put me off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stagy and Drags...But Undeniably An Off-Beat Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Talky, Claustrophobic, Message Western, a Who-Done-It that is a Remake of a Kurosawa Film from 1950 (Rashomon). If you haven't seen it, don't Fret, only Film School Geeks and Residents of Japan have had the Pleasure. It is said that it is one of the All-Time Greats.That will Never be said of this one. An Intellectual's Movie that is Thoughtful, but Plodding, and by the time the Same Story is told for the Fourth Time, you may want some Relief. You get it here by turning a Rape/Murder Story into Something of a Slapstick Ending.Another Thing much Talked About, from those who Talk About such Things, is the Debatable Miscasting of Paul Newman as a Bandido. An Argument could be made either way. This is just too Stagy to Matter that much and there is Dialog and more Dialog and still more Dialog, all essentially telling the same Thing from a Different Perspective. That's the Whole Point of the Movie. In case you didn't Get It the first two Times the Scenario is Replayed.The Film has a Dark and Brooding look and the Actors all turn things Up a Notch, and some say Newman turns it up more than one. Overall it is Certainly Off-Beat, and Finely Made, but has a few Missteps that Add to the Delirium and at Times the Movie moves with too much Weight and Drags. Interesting, to say the Least, but Occasionally Boring and the Ending is a Letdown, although it does have a Baby(?).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"To me, killing is not very importante..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A woman (Claire Bloom) is raped and her husband killed. A Mexican bandit (Paul Newman, believe it or not) is put on trial for the crimes. But there are four conflicting stories about what really happened: the bandit's, the woman's, a prospector's, and an old Indian's. Western remake of Rashomon is, not surprisingly, inferior to that classic in every way. However, it is entertaining although not always for the right reasons. It has a nice cast, most of whom turn in terrible performances. Paul Newman is especially bad. Probably the most embarrassing role of his career. Other stinkers in the cast include William Shatner, Howard Da Silva, and Paul Fix. Edward G. Robinson is the best actor in the movie. His character is broad and prone to being over-the-top like the others but he manages to rein it in just right. Claire Bloom and Laurence Harvey do fine but are nothing special. Not a great movie by any means but curiosity factor warrants giving it a look, particularly if you're a Newman or Robinson fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrice-Told Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's difficult to know - or even guess - what Ritt and Newman were trying to do here other, of course, than offer an update on Roshomon. As I have no knowledge of the Broadway production that preceded the film I can't say whether it is a more or less faithful adaptation or whether they have added further spin. What seems clear is that Mr. Newman had been frightened by Brando's Emiliano Zapata and was eager to show that he, too, could sport a moustache and an unwashed look. By casting Laurence Harvey, that most wooden of actors, opposite Claire Bloom, Ritt has ensured that some of the mahogany wears off on her and both sport risible Southern accents. By far the most interesting aspect is the Black and White photography and unusual angles, as for the framing device involving three travellers at a railroad station, your guess is as good as mine. Ambitious, yes, but as someone once said, ambition should be made of sterner stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Little Subjectivity Here And There</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having never seen Rashomon I'm at bit of a disadvantage in writing about The Outrage. Nevertheless it's an attempt at something a little more unusual than the average western. As even the beating of Rodney King caught on videotape was successfully challenged in a court of law, what does that say about eye witness testimony? The Outrage is the story of an incident on a western trail that left a traveler dead and his wife ravaged by a bandit on the run.Rashomon the film is only the grandfather of The Outrage. It was first adapted as a Broadway play with Rod Steiger and Noel Willman playing the roles that Paul Newman and Laurence Harvey have on screen. It ran for 159 performances in the 1959 season and Claire Bloom who was Mrs. Rod Steiger at the time was the only one to repeat her role. Rod Steiger would have been a far better choice to repeat for the screen and he certainly has the screen name recognition. Newman was better box office, but Steiger was far better at playing all kinds of ethnic types.Added to the screen are the characters of Edward G. Robinson and William Shatner playing a conman and a disillusioned minister whose conversations with prospector Howard DaSilva provide a kind of narrative framework for the proceedings. DaSilva provides one of four versions of the events. All we know for certain is that Claire Bloom got violated by Paul Newman and Laurence Harvey wound up dead. At Newman's trial, he and Bloom provide differing accounts of what happened. An old Indian medicine man played by Paul Fix came upon a dying Laurence Harvey and Fix repeats it for the court. And then DaSilva tells Shatner and Robinson yet another version of the same events.Bloom is a southern belle, not quite of the upper crust, she married well and she does her best to imitate the behavior of one of the upper crust, no doubt taking Scarlett O'Hara as her model. Laurence Harvey is Ashley Wilkes had he married a road show version of Scarlett instead of Melanie Hamilton. Repeating her performance from Broadway, I'd say Claire was the best one in this film.The conclusion was most unsatisfactory in my humble opinion, the focus could have and should have stayed on the three protagonists not on the witnesses. Still The Outrage is definitely a most adult western.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>quirky / worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[possible spoiler] I was drawn to this film by the cast - Paul Newman, Edward G. Robinson, Laurence Harvey, Claire Bloom, William Shatner, Howard daSilva - a bunch of heavy hitters for sure. The 'Rashomon'-like premise certainly keeps us guessing as to what the NEXT version of events will be, but to me it is somewhat marred by the jarringly comic resolution provided by the prospector. The film is beautifully shot, and Alex North provides a fine score (with a good chunk of faux-Copland at one point). However two stellar performances really make the film. Edward G. Robinson's turn as the cynical huckster reminds us of what a truly great actor he was. And Paul Newman as Carrasco puts in a performance totally at odds with the familiar Hud/Cool Hand Luke/Fast Eddie persona; his performance as the crude, swaggering Mexican bandit was so effective, his Spanish accent so good, that at first I did not recognize him as Newman. A neglected film that is well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're going to do a movie with multiple flashbacks told from different points of view, the ground covered in those flashbacks better be damned interesting. Such is not the case here. Each witness' version of the events in question becomes progressively more pedestrian until the final one is played for laughs. This is the movie's point, of course, that people would rather believe well-spun myths which confirm their own preconceived notions about human nature than a banal truth that won't conform. All fine and good, but it's a danged self-destructive way to tell a story. Especially when James Wong Howe's apocalyptic visuals (those rain-drenched scenes at the isolated train station are almost Blade Runner-ish in their darkness and despair) are gearing you up from the first moment for some grimly powerful examination of evil.The sad fact is that Laurence Harvey and Claire Bloom, as the victimized husband and wife at the heart of the film, do not come across as terribly noteworthy or distinctive. You keep waiting for some explosive revelation that might account for the idealistic Parson (played by William Shatner - young and fresh-faced but overly-mannered even then) to be so shattered by the incident that he loses his faith, but no luck. Edward G. Robinson is excellent as the old con artist with no illusions about mankind, while a close to unrecognizable Paul Newman does an entertaining Anthony Quinn impression as the dastardly bandito.The train station segments are sensational, film-making at its best, but the endless flashbacks are flat and tedious as hell, making this film a uniquely disappointing experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the style of Rashomon...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Outrage, starring Paul Newman, is the Western remake of the Japanese classic, Rashomon. It basically cam be summed up, without giving anything away, that there is a man accused of a crime, the only problem is that all of the witnesses have varying accounts on the events which occurred. The acting in this movie was not anything very noteworthy, but it certainly was not bad. The same can be said for the camera-work in this film, it was not breath taking, but it was not bad. The whole movie, aside from the plot, was average. However, the saving grace of this film is certainly the plot. At first the movie seems very straight-forward, a man committed a crime and he is to be punished. It seems as if the movie has little place to go, and that possibly the main bulk of the movie will occur after the trial. However, it soon becomes apparent that there is much more to this seemingly ordinary occurrence than meets the eye. This cinematic work is much more than a simple story about deceit, it is a story about the truth. Not the truth of the crime, but the truth about the enigma which is the human psyche. The deceptions are not what make the movie, it is the logic behind the deceptions that truly makes the movie what it is. A movie, after all, is not only what has been made, but rather, it is more so what you make of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was disappointed to see a film made so recently (1964) perpetuating the myths that women put up a fight but ultimately enjoy being raped or that they secretly want to be raped. The only witness's story that didn't make that point was the wife's, &amp; James Shatner (glazed eyes fixed on the horizon) immediately moved to undermine her account. The train station scenes were stilted &amp; unrealistic with the exception of the last several minutes. Paul Newman thrashed around like a beached trout doing his semi-animalistic "bandito" portrayal, &amp; if I were of Mexican descent I'd have scathing things to say about it. I'm not sure why the film-makers played the last version of the story for laughs - it was really jarring after the sturm-und-drang of the first three versions. The movie generally seemed to be making the point that people present as truth the version of events that casts themselves in the best light, but the last version focused more on the idea that people are ridiculous whatever they do, &amp; the 2 ideas don't mesh very well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am no actor, and I realize scenes are frequently shot out of sequence. But don't the actors have some sort of inkling as to how poor a picture is while they are making it?I've never been one for "flashback" movies, but this one with several different versions of the flashback is just too much.There were a couple good pieces of acting, such as when Bloom accused her husband of cowardice, but they were too few to carry the movie. The last 8 to 10 minutes were more like 3 Stooges/Laurel &amp; Hardy slapstick comedy sliding down a waterfall into a pond and spitting water...c'mon!I did enjoy the scenery around Tucson, and the music was pretty good, also. The rest of it left me scratching my head. This is a movie I had timer-recorded to DVD and did not watch for quite a while since recording it, so it is in my collection. I have real doubts it will ever get another watch by me.And what's up with the baby? Did the writers just say "Hey, this ought to work for something?"It's a pity, too, because with de Silva, Newman, Bloom, Robinson...these are actors I really like. They could have made a much better movie.I rarely give less than 5 stars, but this one only rates 4 from me.jonesey65244</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At least as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I own a great number of Akira Kurosawa films. My favorite is "Dersu Uzala," not "Rashomon." However, I did enjoy Rashomon; and I certainly enjoyed "The Outrage." For some reason The Outrage is put down all the time while Rashomon is elevated to classic status. I think if one deserves it the other does also. I think part of this is that Kurosawa is worshiped by many and the Japanese culture shown in Rashomon is "correct" for an artistic type film. Westerns are not supposed to artistic and abstract type films. Clint Eastwood plots, yes; artsy plots no. Other than The Outrage, I cannot think of another really artsy type western.Rashomon and the Outrage are both artistic type films. Rashomon has some things with it that I don't hold all that highly. The insane, for no reason, of Toshiro Mifune's laughter during the trial was rediculous and a real turn-off for me. I find this dumb laughter quite often in Kurosawa films, especially the Samarai films. One of the things that I appreciate very highly with The Outrage, over Rashomon, is the language spoken being in English. I own ten Akira Kurosawa films (I just counted them) so the sub-titles that are required to be read is not enough for me not to enjoy the films. However, I certainly do find that having to constantly read the translation line detracts from the film. You have to concentrate on the written word rather than on the actor's on the screen.SLIGHT SPOILER: The Outrage is a close remake of Rashomon. Certain things are a bit different. The gunfight scene between Lawrence Harvey and Paul Newman is quite funny, which is not funny in Rashomon. In fact, I really don't remember much humor in Rashomon, other than the insane laughter spoken of above. So the slight humor twist is different, and I don't remember Lawrence Harvey's character in Rashomon killing himself with the knife; and, I could be wrong here, but I also don't recall him ever falling, accidently, on a knife.The Outrage had great first rate actor's in it. Paul Newman's portrayal of the Mexican bandit was rather right-on in my opinion. Mr. Newman was not recognisable as Paul Newman, in character. Some people have said that he way overacted, I don't think so; and if you compare it to Toshiro Mifune's portrayal of the Japanese bandit, it certainly was not. I think some Japanese actor's should have went to laughing school, as it certainly isn't realistic in their films.In closing: They are both great films. The Outrage should not be considered an inferior remake of the original. Always thought the part with the baby at the end was a bit strange, logic wise. I mean, would you leave a child in a broken down building with only two or three, more-or-less, losers there? Would you not leave your child somewhere that might have a brighter suspect, than a building by the city's gate or a train station?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this film was made today it would most likely be released in "art" film theaters. A vanity film for the director and the stars, the movie sort of plods along, trying to make points about important things in life without coming to any final absolute conclusion.The story is concerned about a rape that took place and is told in flashbacks thru four different viewpoints of the ones that were present (the bandit, the wife, a passerby, and we even get the testimony from the dead husband!) Each one, of course, puts their own spin on the story. What is the truth?...Hmmmm.Paul Newman, in what might appear as a bit of apparent miscasting, does a superb job as the Mexican bandit---to the inattentive eye, he is unrecognizable as Paul Newman for the first few minutes of the film. William Shatner plays a preacher and once again appears to "overact" in a role that should have been played more subtly. Edward G. Robinson plays his role with gusto and is always interesting to watch. Laurence Harvey has a part that required the least amount of acting in any of his films---much of the time he is tied to a tree!</fullReview>

Eventually, it gets cleared up. Movie over.Lots and lots of talking. Lots and lots.It's a fairly enjoyable movie for most people, the apparent exception being people with liberal arts degrees. This is a remake. So it is automatically trash to anyone who took film-making 101 as an elective. There are two fine counter-arguments. One is that every play of Shakespeare was stolen from earlier works. The second is that all good stories will be remade someday. Yes, even Earnest Goes to Camp will be redone some day.The 1950 movie Rashomon by Akira Kurosawa is known to some as a classic. It's chief quality, the directing, is the sole reason why Rashomon is remembered today. It is remembered, but not viewed. It has too many deficiencies. Rashomon was in Japanese. Not too many of us speak Japanese. It had Japanese actors. Not too many of us know any Japanese actors. It was set in Japan. Not too many of us prefer a Japanese feudal setting to a rootin-tootin Western.Rashomon still shows in colleges. Lots of freshman find deep meaning it. Lots of professors swear it is the epitome of film-making. None of them watch it outside the classroom.Watch this movie if you like a meandering whodunit set in cowboy days.Watch Rashomon if you are Japanese, speak Japanese, like movies set in Japan, and like movies even slower than this one. Or if your professor makes you watch it.</fullReview>
