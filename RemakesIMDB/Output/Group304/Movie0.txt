		<shortDescription>Perfect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After viewing this movie I thought, what was wrong with it? When it got to about 10 minutes of thinking I realized that this was a hopeless effort.Honestly, if you can't give this film a 10 out of 10, what other movie deserves one? This film is the perfect mix of comedy, drama, romance, some of the best storytelling I've ever seen, and even some surprise action scenes! And what's best, it's universal. I'm sure some would avoid this film simply because it's Korean - but that's where you'd make a mistake.This film makes sense to anyone who's a teenager or has been one (recently.) Both college students, the clumsy, laid back Gyeon-woo and "The Girl", a whimsical tomcat, make for one interesting couple for the main characters. And everything that they encounter throughout the film magically comes together in the end, and it's truly heartwarming. You'll laugh, you'll cry, no matter who you are. I guarantee it. It couldn't be any better!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deeply touching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my ?afterword" ? maybe it's written more for myself, but please don't mind it and my lack in English too.When watching movies we rarely know what to wait from them and the least we wait the film to affect us so hard that suddenly a completely new dimension appears to us, that the movie will make us to look on things and life from a different viewpoint, will make you to remember forgotten things. But movies like that exist, and this is one of them .Thinking about this film I start to consider what the movie makers really want to achieve creating films and what is the task for a movie. Is it a picture movie with good cameraman's work, good acting , story or impressive special effects? These things are important ,but in my opinion, in a good movie the main is the message of it. I don't know if it is the director, the scriptwriter or the crew together who made this movie to touch the viewer, made him to look with a different look, who worked to make this film to deliver the message as it is, but I can say that they have achieved their aim.This movie is humane. It's message and characters are humane. It has no meaning if the end of the movie is happy or sad - there is joy and pain both in it, because that's exactly how the life is.I liked this movie. But it is impossible for me to rate it the same it's not possible for me to rate my own life.This movie touched me. I hope that many others too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPOILER: Excellent movie that worth seeing the 2nd time to enjoy the detail</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The attention to detail, the depth and width of the plot is amazing. The movie is so good that it provide good entertainment to many audience.I cannot grasp all of it till I saw it the second time. There are several plots in the movie. I am learning more about the movie when I am writing this.It's NOT only a love story of how 2 people with contrasting personality fall in love; it may give that impression to some people. It's NOT a normal dumb boy chase beautiful girl flick.STOP READING and see the movie again if you really think this movie is just a romantic flick with funny jokes. You will enjoy it more.SUPER SPOILER ---------------------The Character: The girl always think she is special (she say that explicitly when she is crying at the hillside), and which beautiful girl doesn't? Or at least everyone else wish to? She is very self-centered, proud, witty (remember how quick she get Gyun-Woo out of class?), talented (kendo, piano, squash, dance), not afraid of how people look at her, live in a quite well off family etc.The director has to stress that Gyun-Woo is smart (from their parents) because viewer may not really notice that if they don't really observe. He is a sensitive person, probably due to his girlish upbringing.Gyun-Woo is quite layback, and yet to determine what he desire or want in life in the beginning. And that's one of the reason the girl said, 'I have met the boy from the future' at the ending. For the first 3 years they meet, they are not really ready for each other, due her ex-boyfriend (exbf) and personality. They are at the crossroad, so they eventually have to split.The Story: In the subway, Gyun-Woo gets the girl's attention immediately since he looks like her ex-boyfriend. She may actually intentionally grasp his attention by vomiting etc. Then she announces to the public right away that he is her 'Sweet heart', so he have no option but to take care of her. As a proof of Gyun-Woo getting her attention is that, she scold at the youngster who wears pink. She thinks he is special and no one else should wear the same color for the one she thinks special. This point can verified again in the park which the guy who smokes and wear the same blue-colored sweater. She knows she is beautiful and clothing matter a lot for her or those she cares.It is quite deceiving that most viewer will initially think that only Gyun-Woo is attracted by the girl and a normal boy chase girl story starts. But it's not. They both are attracted to each other at their first sight.To call Gyun-Woo 'sweet heart' may come from her subconscious. It is so important to her to understand herself that she need to confirm with Gyun-Woo that she indeed think Gyun-Woo has so much resemblance with her exbf. So she phoned Gyun-Woo to come out for the 1st time. (Phone number probably obtained during their stay at the police station)After Gyun-Woo left the girl on a bench, he forget the girl's handbag and he have to return it a few steps later. Later, he forget her handbag again in the rain. This time leads him to visit the girl's home for the first time. We can see that every detail is well layout, intentional in this movie.First time I see the movie, I was distracted by my laughing, but now I know the reason why police rush up to the motel. The phone call is made by the girl's parent. That's one of the reasons why her parents' are not approved of him. And they know it's all lie when he try explaining why the motel's lighter is in his pocket.(Is there any meaning for the kids to all suddenly gone when they are in the coffees shop? And why does the coffee come so late?) (Why does the girl slap Gyun-Woo so often? Is there any meaning behind?)The Girl always tries to be different. She doesn't like people dress alike; she doesn't like those people ordering the same golbangee (beef stew) in the restaurant.Why are they using the same motel room the second night? On the first night the innkeeper says there no room left from 1st to 3rd floor, so on the second night the same thing happened coincidentally; all other rooms are occupied.Do your recognize in her first script Gyun-Woo asks why don't they kiss at the end? He is actually talking about why they do not kiss in this movie. Then the girl (director) says that this script (movie) is not a melodrama. (Then, how come this movie is a action movie?)Also, the first script prophesize the girl saving Gyun-Woo in the playground later.For the second script, I will talk about that later.The reason why she pushes Gyun-Woo into the water is she wants Gyun-Woo in the water too. She wants Gyun-Woo in some way connected to her exbf too. Her exbf drowned, implied when the girl staring at a pier with the ex-bf's mother later. Assuming that she don't know whether Gyun-Woo can swim or not, the girl is confident that she can rescue him OR she hope this boy will not just leave her, by a simple drowning accident. The story did not tell how her ex-bf drowned, whether the girl is present or not. But if the girl was at the scene at the accident, that means she have learnt lifegaurding after he died (which I biasedly assume). Nevertheless, the girl found peace of mind/satisfaction that she knows if she is together with any boy, the boy will not be drowned. She wants to try and confirm that with this boy.In the playground's 'Ghost House', the girl say the pain one suffered from being dumped will be gone quicker than one can imagine. But it looks like it is contrary to her own behavior. So, why she said that? Actually the girl is not just grieving for the death of her exbf at this stage. She is also guilty, angry with herself on not loving her ex-bf as much any more. Or at least, she is struggling with try keep loving him or kicks him out of her mind/present life. Rationally, she knows this is the thing to do, to face it, to leave away from the ghost of his exbf. However, she is not as 'special' as she would like, that she still long for him, since she is attracted to Gyun-Woo the first time they met.The soldier claimed the guardhouse sergeant looks like Gyun-Woo. Who else look like Gyun-Woo? He should be the ex-bf. The director maybe even hinting that he is not that good to the Girl, although the girl never know this. Well, I may be stretching that a bit here, but considered so many detail in this movie have an explanation, I won't be surprised if this is what the director meant.When the girl is saving Gyun-Woo under gunpoint, she cried. She is actually talking to herself this time. She think that her dead ex-bf want her to live well. She says if she needs to learn what love is, she need to live well. To live well, love is essential, but this is what a dead man cannot give her. This is her struggle.At the end of the playground scene Gyun-Woo say what had happened is as if what he have planned. He intends to understand the girl better at her birthday. At this stage all he know is the girl is devastated from a breakup, but not much else. Under such a stressful circumstances, the answer she give on how she view about her pain, view of good life/love must be authentic. It's something hard to achieve by a normal date on this girl. Although the means is not what he expected, the ends is. And the last slap on his face is always good. It means she cares.Part 2 *****Gyun-Woo noticed somehow notice the girl in the restaurant. Then Gyun-Woo goes back alone and asks around about this picture because Gyun-Woo will not ask that when the girl is around. Gyun-Woo want to understand her pain, try solving it. The girl bring Gyun-Woo there a lot. By now, Gyun-Woo is really a replacement for his exbf, and he knows. He tries to be nice and smile. And Gyun-Woo said that she pretends to be happy every time (in this restaurant), because he knows she has lots of memory/history with her exbf in this restaurant. And she comes back with him often.Not too sure why the bad guy in the 3rd script is called Gyun-Woo, and why she have to kill him? If the director really meant the bad guy = her exbf (because they are look-alike and the director don't want to give a name to her exbf), it means the girl try forget him. And interestingly the girl comes from future, so the director may think she can only forget him some time in future?After the script, she says 'Someday, I'll meet someone from the future'. Actually, it means 'Today, she meet someone (important to her= Gyun-Woo) that will be suitable for her in the future'. Then Gyun-Woo says, 'if you do, ask him to take you; if it's possible!' Gyun-Woo is urging her to let himself to take her! Gyun-Woo looks very serious at this moment. This is not a joke of 'You, sassy girl, let someone come from a UFO/future kidnap you!'After the 3rd script, they always ride subway together, play squash, phone each other every night, and wait for Gyun-Woo at school etc. The girl really starts to love him, ever since Gyun-Woo chase her on high heel. The longer he runs, the longer she loves him. She remains jubilant that night. Even in the rain, she is even nice enough to him, to run back home for an umbrella. Each day, she likes Gyun-Woo more and more.Their parent controls her too much. (Party) because she love them too, she refrain herself from seeing Gyun-Woo/have to dealt directly with her parents about this. So, Gyun-Woo doesn't have any news from her for a long time until their 100th day when their parent give her pressure.In the taxi, Gyun-Woo wonders if she still needs him as her exbf's replacement. He tries to heal her pain, but he thinks the irony is that once the pain is gone, she no longer needs him. He is well aware that the 'action'/'power' is always initiated from her. But just for this moment, it does not matter; he enjoys every moment with her. He ask the taxi driver to let them stay together longer.Maybe what Gyun-Woo think is correct, she doesn't need him anymore. That's why once her parent again pressured her this time; they don't meet each other for such a long time that Gyun-Woo think they are over. So it's not too surprising for Gyun-Woo to go to a blind date.The condom and blind date joke is really funny, though gross.This time, the girl has a blind date. She definitely is not the one who arrange it, her controlling parents do. She call Gyun-Woo for help, Gyun-Woo is her 'friend'. She has to call and give Gyun-Woo a chance here, since this time her blind date is quite nice.Ah... the 10 rules are very moving. Gyun-Woo must be very sad when he left the restaurant. He gives up on her. He is giving his final blessing to them.The girl finally realizes that she did not recognize how deep he loves her. He deserve much more than a replacement or 'friend'. Everything she did want Gyun-Woo do for her is simply the way she try to find her exbf in Gyun-Woo. Gyun-Woo is not necessary Gyun-Woo in her mind at those important moments. She thought she just enjoy reliving it. But after the 10 rules, she can no longer deny Gyun-Woo is the one who makes her happy, not the ghosts of her exbf.Before they try kissing, Gyun-Woo said they are on a crossroad since she had always regarded Gyun-Woo as painkiller. But now she knows that she feel guilty for him and it's time for her to take action, to accept Gyun-Woo as 'another' important person in her life. Gyun-Woo has already done all he can at this stage.But for the Girl to look at Gyun-Woo is painful. He reminds her of his ex-bf, every time. They look and seem to act alike. She has to completely remove her ex-bf (first love, I believe)'s image before she can really love Gyun-Woo. But she feels guilty to try removing her exbf from her mind, at the same time.When Gyun-Woo is writing the letter, saying he want to be serious with her. But even though he doesn't know exactly what she's thinking, he is sensitive enough to think this letter is for their split up.At the mountain, she express that her ex-bf is still very well within her. She hopes she is different, she hope she have the will to overcome, but no, she is still helpless. She cannot avoid thinking of her ex-bf when seeing Gyun-Woo. She is sorry, for that.They have to split; Gyun-Woo's presence is too disturbing for her to forget. She gives herself 2 years. She goes away for Gyun-Woo. Gyun-Woo tries to grow up and his life in these 2 years just devoted to her; he even tried and succeeds fulfilling her dream. No more blind dates, he is committed.The way they pile up the stones (and how Gyun-Woo remove it), one-by-one instead of bushing them away is quite a display sensitivenessOvertime ***** It's quite too late to explain clearly the drowning of her exbf now. It makes lots of audience miss why her grievance is so deep. And may not understand some finer points of the movie.Now we know why the girl ask about the handkerchief when Gyun-Woo is with the girl was crying at the 2nd restaurant. A handkerchief has a very special meaning for her. This was how her exbf meet her.She says 'While I was dating you, I met his mother OFTEN, she wanted to introduce a nice men to me, BUT I couldn't' Simply means she is still love her exbf very much at that time. Also, it's quite funny that she thinks her exbf wants to introduce Gyun-Woo to her, when Gyun-Woo is hanging out with her.She wants to put this letter into a time capsule because it is too cruel so tell Gyun-Woo all this right away. And she does believe she will overcome her mental barrier in 2 year. However she cannot. It takes her 3 years.What the old man says to her is important; he makes her know that Gyun-Woo is still very much in love with her. Time means nothing to him, just for her (NB. This is what the theme song about)The girl called Gyun-Woo's phone but the number has been changed. She cried. Wondered if they ever met again, when she is ready for him now, after 3 years. Not too sure if they'd ever meet by chance again. Then she smiled. But why she smiles? Maybe she has just remembered how Gyun-Woo pretended the voice message long time ago? Or have her just lost hope and grin bitterly? The tiny touches let audience imagines, and could as well be the ending at this point.Can they meet by chance? Very often fate only give you 1 chance. Once you lose it, you lose it. Gyun-Woo must be very upset when he misses her this time in the subway.Maybe due to coincidence, they finally met each other at her exbf's mom's lunch.Then she said, 'I think I met a man from the future, from your (Gyun-Woo)'s future.' Do you recall all 1st and 3d script tells a story of girl coming from future helps Gyun-Woo or everyone else? But this time, she meant instead of the girl coming from future, it is the boy coming from future that saves her.The best part of the movie is that it can be viewed from many angles. Many subplots.. ---------------------------------------The Platform plot: ------------------ After the 10 rules, Gyun-Woo stands on the verge of subway platform (as seen on the surveillance camera). Is he trying to feel her pain of the breakup that she experienced with her exbf when she stood there? Was she really trying to kill herself at that time? He wants to understand this feeling. Or simply just want to remember how they first met. Then, He must be really happily running when he hear her voice form the broadcast.At the end of movie, when she stands on the platform edge again, we only saw her feet. But what's really on her mind? Is she expecting Gyun-Woo will pull her back again this time? Now they have lost contact, will coincidence let them meet again? Or is she simply enjoying the thought of how they first meet? Nevertheless the subway come, she has to reluctantly drag her feet back, behind the yellow line.The edge of the platform is a crossroad of their fate. This is the place she is going to suicide, where they met, where they miss each other, where travel together and getting to like each other etc.The Science Fiction Plot: ------------------ At the girl's third script, she mentioned explicitly the science fiction Plot of this movie, UFO = time machine. Then she prophesize Gyun-Woo will like to travel back in time, the old-aged Gyun-Woo. She said 'people from the future could be here now'Why don't they travel together? Did the girl left Gyun-Woo/died before the invention of time machine? Well, this is a story not being told. However, it is hinted that it's quite likely that the girl go back and make fun of him with the toad in the time capsule. How about the head hitting squash? Another naughty joke from future?In her letter in the time capsule, she feels that Gyun-Woo 'live in the future' and she 'live in the past'From the look of the old man under the tree, do you think he is expecting her to visit the tree? Don't you think it's quite rude for him to stare at her? Yet the old man's answer is honest enough, because she is beautiful. The old man always says that because he is the old Gyun-Woo. And of course he read the letters.What is his secret of the tree? Gyun-Woo cannot really replace a tree. But with the help of the old Gyun-Woo, he can. This is a secret because the old Gyun-Woo only wants to share this between him and her! No one else! He say 'Fate is building a bridge of chance for someone you love' because he is help building this bridge for themselves.When she lookup after reading Gyun-Woo's letter, a UFO passes by; even with sound effect.The old Gyun-Woo was there inside the train when they met.At the end, she said 'I think I met a man from the future, from your (Gyun-Woo)'s future'. This is literally what has happened.The Girl's second script ------------------ For the 2nd time I see this movie, I cannot fully grasp this script. But now I can. Actually the girl is committing suicide when they first met. She know she get drunk easily, it easier to do it that way. She wants to die at the 1st year anniversary of her exbf's death. This is why in her 2nd script the 'unlucky' boy should be buried alive, which simply meant lovers should better die together. Do you think that the girl looks more like a ghost than a drunken woman at the platform? It's quite a drastic look for lead actress in movie that supposed to be a comedy (at least at the beginning). The vomit after that is very good. It makes the audience forget her awful look, or forget to wonder if she is commiting suicide. But isn't that quite crazy for anyone to vomit onto someone. We all know that she is drunk but is still quite aware of her action. But naturally, she doesn't really care since she planned to kill herself anyway! The girl is not as sassy as most people perceived. But she's pretty unruly anyway.When dating with Gyun-Woo, she always has to struggle with her guilt to her exbf, since her exbf have done nothing wrong to her. He have no choice, he have to leave her. For her, to accept a person that is in many ways resembles her exbf as another individual, is a especially difficult task. Her life can be much easier if she choose that nice guy at her blind date (or any other guy); but she knows Gyun Woo is her right choice however difficult this choice is.The Theme of the story is: Fate vs. Coincidence ------------------ Tons of coincidence happened here: Gyun-Woo is a look-alike, know the exbf's mother, is that coincidence? How coincidence is that the one girl you pick randomly on the street is the Girl? The birthday of the Girl and the soldier is the same; Blind date at the same night; the handkerchief, which is the first favor of both her ex-bf and Gyun-Woo give, is greenish; they both first met in subway; they have meet all of the 5 twins, without them recognizing....At the end of movie, Gyun-Woo asked, 'Is that coincidence?' This is the question the director is asking the audience what is fate and what is pure coincidence. Director's view of Fate is it happens only when one build/desire of it. He demonstrate that by putting lots of coincidence in the movie, while let both characters work hard for/build up their good ending, which many people will regard that as fate.Examples of building chances: The old Gyun-Woo is help building his own fate under the tree by voicing the young Gyun-Woo's effort. And during the 3 years separation they are building a bridge for each other on their own, by making themselves available for each other. If the girl still cannot get out of her exbf's entangle, there is no point of meeting again. And now Gyn-Woo seems to find a direction of his life on writing script.Lastly, have her exbf also bridge a bridge for the one he loved? Gyun-Woo and the girl met on the 1st year of his death anivesary. And the girl actually thinks her exbf want to introduce Gyun-Woo to her. Maybe a supernatural plot is included here too! ;) Have her exbf arranged their final meeting by his mom etc? Even Gyun-Woo does not considered himself look like his cousin (but the girl, her ex-bf, his mom does)By the director's definition, it is their fate to be together eventually.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film is a heartwarming blend of physical comedy and straight melodrama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILERS AHEAD*...taken from a reaction paper I wrote for Social Science Class..My Sassy Girl is a 2001 film by Korean director Kwak Jae Yong, formerly known for the straight melodramas he directed. It was based on the novel with the same title, compiled from the journals posted on the Internet by Kim Ho Seok about his relationship with a girl. The film catapulted its lead actress Jeon Ji Hyun and its lead actor Cha Tae Hyun into superstardom. It spawned viewers' interest in romantic comedies, although it was never recognized in the west.My Sassy Girl starts out with Gyeon-Woo, a na?ve but eccentric 25 year-old college student who doesn't have a clear direction in life. He narrates how his parents raised him like a girl, and how his parents' constantly telling him he was smart caused him to become lazy. His life then becomes intertwined with that of a bizarre girl whom he meets at the subway. She was drunk and wasted when he first saw her, and before passing out at the subway she calls him 'honey'. He was then forced to take responsibility for her, and that night he carried the wasted girl on her back all the way to a nearby motel. Hilarity ensues in the following scenes, as Gyeon-Woo and the girl share funny moments together, such as hitting each other on the subway, playing squash (the ball always hitting Gyeon-Woo squarely in the face), dancing in the disco with their high school uniforms on, and exchanging shoes (the girl wears sneakers while Gyeon-Woo wears heels).The early parts of the film showcase the girl's bizarre attitude. The girl can be seen arguing with strangers, writing synopses of action movies, passing out after drinking three glasses of beer, and hitting Gyeon-Woo all the time, telling him 'wanna die?' and using him to get her way. Gyeon-Woo, on the other hand, succumbs to all the girl's whims and does everything for her. The first half of the film is filled with pure physical comedy and witty, hilarious sequences.What sets this movie apart from others is how the second half of the film, which consists of pure melodrama, is connected to the first half. The second half explains the girl's bizarre attitude and unfolds all the drama behind the girl's comedic behavior in the first half. Gyeon-Woo battles a conflict with himself and finds it hard to let the girl go after 'healing her sorrow'. The latter scenes in the film are so dramatic that it 'turns grown men into crybabies' (quoted from the International Movie Database). Jeon Ji-Hyun's acting versatility added to the second half's strong impact on the viewers. A very ingeniously written script turns the laughing audience into a crying one in a short span of time.However sad the second half of the film may be, the 'overtime' part of the film wonderfully concludes all the comedy and drama that unfolded in the preceding two parts. Gyeon-woo and the girl go along with the sad fate that befell them, continuing their own lives. The ending (which I will not reveal, for I recommend that people watch it) could be considered as one of the greatest ones in the history of film-making. It left no questions unanswered, and it concluded all the subtle hints that the earlier parts gave. It left me, and other members of the audience, laughing in tears.The uncut version of the film lasts 137 minutes (2 hours and 17 minutes), quite long for a romantic comedy. But it was so craftily and carefully written that one would not notice time ticking by. Every scene in the film gives the viewers something to laugh, cry, or think about. There was no dead air in the story. The cinematography of the film was excellent, for it captured every scene perfectly, also showcasing the beautiful environment of Korea along the way. The soundtrack very much added to the emotion of the film's most significant sequences. George Winston's rendition of 'Pachelbel's Canon in D' invokes a very romantic and joyous feeling that is indeed felt in the scene where Gyeon-Woo gives the girl a rose during her class (at an all-girls school) while she was playing the piano. Shin Seung Hoon's 'I Believe', the movie's main theme, served its function well as the tear-inducer in the most dramatic parts of the film. After watching the movie, only hearing the song brings me to the edge of tears as I remember the saddest parts of the film.Jeon Ji-Hyun's acting in the film was very superior. She does very well in portraying the unnamed girl (yes, the girl's name was never mentioned) in the movie. Her very strong charm and acting versatility (she laughs, threatens Gyeon-Woo, and cries in one scene) makes the film very appealing, even to grown men who grew up watching action movies. Her performance in this film shoved her into the limelight and made girls want to be like her and made boys want to be with her.Cha Tae Hyun did justice to the role of Gyeon-Woo. Just looking at him makes you laugh, and his being punched, slapped and manipulated by the girl is one of the big factors in the film's success as a comedy. His performance in the film made him one of Korea's 'most wanted dates', according to a survey on Korean girls.Some of the very notable characteristics that I found in the film were: 1.) It had no kissing scenes; 2.) The girl's name was never mentioned, although she played the biggest part in the film, and 3.) There were no 'I love you' lines in the entirety of the film.After watching the uncut version of the film, I saw tears in the eyes of most people in the audience. I could most probably say the movie has been successful in moving its viewers.Jeon Ji Hyun won the 2002 Grand Bell Best Actress Award for her performance in this film. Cha Tae Hyun won Best New Actor at the 2002 Korean Oscars for his performance in this film. My Sassy Girl was number one at the box office for six straight weeks in Korea and sold over 20,000 tickets per day in Hong Kong at the time of its release in 2001. It was the second highest grosser of that year (accumulating more box office loot than SHREK, HARRY POTTER or LORD OF THE RINGS). It was the Best Asian Film at the 22nd Annual Hong Kong Film Awards. Just this year, Dreamworks (an American film company) has been planning for a Hollywood remake of this film. How great could this film get? My Sassy Girl is a film close to my heart. It is not only a lighthearted comedy that delves into the culture and behavior of Asian teenagers. This movie shows that there are so many different ways of expressing your love without saying 'I love you'. It is a movie that proves 'fate is building a bridge of chance for the one you love'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie with my girlfriend. I don't think we stopped laughing at it for a bit. I think this is one of the funniest movies ever. Everything from it made me feel happy. This has about the most well defined characters you'll ever see on film that are true to how they really are. I enjoyed this film so much. The girl was really cute, and she was mean and she was sweet. The guy wanted a girl and all he ever really found was this girl who was actually a guy. Then the movie got really sad. I couldn't believe why the girl was so sad, but that part made me cry. It ended up being a quest on trying to find out what true love is. Letting go is a really hard thing, but letting go of something else you've found when you find out how dear that really is to you can mean the entire world in the end. I love this movie... :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, Jovial and best of all, True to romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that makes you think about it for hours after you have seen it(whether the first or the fifth time). The reason being that it is funny, witty and enthralling while still maintaining the charisma of a great Korean romantic movie.You will undoubtedly hate Ji-Hyun Jun for the better half of the film but by the end, she will be one of the most enchanting woman you ever saw (Besides Audrey Hepburn off-course). Tae-Hyun Cha plays the role of a difident sort nice guy but with good acting and sound expressions.Overall, I would give this a 10/10. Don't forget to read the book though, its a lot funnier and accurate.Thank you</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My first Korean movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this movie with absolutely zero expectations...was almost asleep and watched it at a friend's place to pass the time. To my surprise, while it is not the best movie, it is definitely one of my favorites of the year and one of my favorite comedies of all time. I hope I get a chance to see it again because apparently there are a lot of little subtle things in it that you don't see the first or maybe even the second time around.I think some people get too caught up in the fact that the movie lacks realism, but I think that's what makes it all the wackier and funnier. I usually have a very low regard for Asian comedies, but this one was certainly worth watching. Absolutely hilarious but maintaining a touching side to it. The characters and situations are so interesting and absorbing that you tend to forget that you are being manipulated by all the sappiness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film by mistake - I simply didn't ender the right saloon, but I don't sorry for that at all. Why you should watch it? - it surely is different from the other films that you've watched lately - the actors are young and they love playing, not like the spoiled Hollywood "wunderkinds"- it's funny- it's realistic /with real emotions and problems of the young people - no matter whether they are in Asia, Europe, or America/- at least for this short time, you can feel something of the culture. I am sure, that you won't find the time for watching the movie lost and won't regret it, like I didn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My sassy girl is a movie kind of old indeed, I have it since it went out on DVD, because every movie I hear good comments I buy it, but honestly I didn't see this movie until yesterday, I saw the directors cut which is 15 minutes longer, so the movies reaches 2 hour 15 minutes, and there wasn't a single minute that I got bore, the movie is the perfect mix of comedy and romance, the comedy part doesn't seems to happen because of forced situations, they are more like things that could happen to your or me. The movie is son engaging that I saw it yesterday and I cant stop thinking about it, honestly I'll see it tomorrow again with some friends, because people usually do not like to watch foreign movies thinking that only Hollywood makes good movies (and that is such a mistake).The actors are cool, honestly in the beginning of the movie I tough common these 2 are the stars? but then you realize they are perfect, casue they seems to be 2 normal everyday people, not HOT STARS with perfects bodys (I ended loving that girl), the chemistry is perfect, the two of them blends together so nice that I could believe that everything that happens on the screen is real.The Score, WOW, I already had to buy it, the music was like I was playing some Final Fantasy game, That means that every music you hear fits perfectly to the scene.My only concern is the remake Dreamworks is doing, that scare me, doing a movie again just cause Americans don't like to watch movies with Asian people? bad very bad, I feel sorrow for them, I am glad I don't have that problem and I can watch this movie the way it was envisioned.One advice: WATCH IT NOW!!!10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know how many times i have watched the movie, because i like the story very much. Its like the story of my classmate and I in my university (because she never become my girlfriend thats why she's just my friend). They have the same traits with the girl in the movie. Thats why I called her sassy girl. First I never expected to like the movie. but when I saw it I cannot help myself to watch it everyday. I bought a copy for myself for me to review the movie everyday... I cried when Gyun Woo gave her blind date 10 rules and the theme song starts to play. This is one of the part that I like most. second was when she played the piano and Gyun Woo gave her a rose. I like the piano piece very much..So watch the movie and see for yourself the hilarious comedy in korean movie history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Romance/Comedy which manages 'real' emotions!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-Minor Spoilers-This film is one of the greatest Romance/Comedy movies ever made, and as such, I feel I will have a hard time doing it justice with a few lines written here. The story was first seen online as an internet diary written by Korean student Ho Sik Kim. And is claimed to be based on a relationship with a girl he actually met. Yeah, that's right. It's a (mostly) true story! Then the story was bought by Korean film production company, Shin Cine. Finally, Korean director, Kwak Jae Yong, 'Sketch of a rainy day' was brought on board to direct. The rest, as they say. is history.The entire movie revolves around two main characters, 'Kyun Woo' (Cha Tae Hyun) and 'The Girl' (Yes, her name is never actually given) played by the wonderful Jeon Ji Hyun. The story begins when Kyun Woo meets the girl on a train platform late at night. See, she's drunk. Very drunk. After making a fool of herself on the train she passes out, but not before calling Kyun Woo "Honey". This leads the other passengers to believe that she is his girlfriend. In turn, our wimpy hero feels obliged to take care of her. So off he goes. Well, at least half way down the platform, before dropping her onto an empty bench. But do you think he has the heart to leave her there? Of course not. That's one of the things that makes this film special. Kyun Woo may be a bit soft. He may be even just a tad pathetic, but his heart is in the right place. All he wants to do is help the girl. But... What does he get in return? Well, He gets a down right scary, weird, psychopath of a girlfriend who takes every opportunity to either A: Hit him B: Humiliate him or C: Get him thrown into Jail. Yes, she's pretty mean. Or is she? Is there more to her than both Kyun Woo, and we the audience, can see? Maybe his wish to help her is not totally unjustified.One of the greatest achievements of this movie is in it's two leads. Considering nearly the entire movie focuses on just two people. The stars did a very good job of keeping up 'very' good chemistry. These are two wonderful actors who portray all the emotions needed, and at a very high level. Cha Tae Hyun, in his first role manages to keep Kyun Woo on just the right side of Bumbling, Shy and even Pathetic. At no point in the movie does he annoy, and that's a hard task indeed. He's always laughable. Granted, sometimes you laugh with him, mostly we laugh 'At him,' but that never stops you from thinking you'd like to have him as your friend. Jeon Ji Hyun however, is just incredible. She is the best actress of her generation. I don't just mean in Korea. I mean PERIOD. She fills the character of 'the girl' with depth, charm and overall a sense of reality which in a film that occasionally becomes far fetched is an excellent achievement indeed. She is incredibly expressive. Most of the time she doesn't even need to say anything. Her face says all we need to know. Some of her expressions are just priceless, and I can honestly say I have never, ever seen them captured on film before. i'd be 'more' than a little surprised if she doesn't become more of an 'international' star in the next few yearsThe film features a wide range of genre's. Although It is primarily a Romance/Comedy film, it also has a dash of action courtesy of the girl's 'Scriptwriting' hobby. This leads to all manor of imagined scenarios staring Jeon Ji Hyun. Be it parodies of 'The Matrix' in her 'Demolition Terminator' story, to an 'Ashes Of Time' style period/swordplay movie later on in the film. These scenes, while not exactly furthering the plot are really well done, and a nice little break from the main story.My favourite aspect of the film is how the director gives little hints and tips as to what is happening in the story without actually telling us. Each and every small detail (Which at first may seem trivial or pointless) will come back to play a major part in the film later on. Apart from being a really neat little way to tell the story, it also makes the film nearly infinitely re-watchable. You can come back to it again and again and you'll always notice something new which enhances the plot. By the time you get to the midpoint of this film you 'will' care for these characters. As it approaches a more touching, less comedic, romance angle you wont lose interest. It's clever, funny, touching and romantic.The only people who may not like this will be those allergic to romantic films. Even then, I feel you may just be surprised. I cannot recommend this film enough. If you don't watch it. You only have yourself to blame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Finest Modern Examples Of Romance At Its Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Yeopgijeogin Geunyeo' (a.k.a. 'My Sassy Girl') is one of the most unconventional love stories I have witnessed in recent cinema. The storytelling is of the most sincere. There's no pretension. The comedy, drama and romance are very well balanced. There is no sex, not even a kiss, no one says 'I love you' and yet it turns out to be one of the most 'romantic' cinematic experience.'Yeopgijeogin Geunyeo' moves at a smooth pace. Jae-young Kwak's screenplay and direction are fantastic. The dialogues are smart and the characters are richly developed and unique. The female protagonist's character remains enigmatic right until the end. Her name isn't even mentioned during the entire film. We see everything from Gyun-woo's point of view and Jae-young Kwak gives detailed insight of the characters and their relationships. There are so many beautiful moments in the film but I won't give out any spoilers. In addition, with the use of a lovely gentle soundtrack and cinematography, he beautifully demonstrates the wonderful locations. Even though I loved the way the Korean culture was portrayed, the story is pretty universal.Newcomer Tae-hyun Cha leads the entire film. His performance is completely natural that it doesn't even feel that he was acting, let alone the fact that he was only new to films. His expressions, spontaneity, reactions and chemistry with co-stars are spot on. He is superb with the comedy and subtle in the dramatic scenes. Gianna Jun holds her own and does a fine job.Overall, 'Yeopgijeogin Geunyeo' is a very well crafted film. It's a heartwarming poetic romantic adventure from start to finish. I know this sounds a bit corny but I'll say that it's a film that's close to my heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three years ago I was at a friends place, we couldn't figure out what to do so she "forced" me to watch "My sassy girl". From the look of the DVD cover I knew this was something I would not enjoy, the picture projected a film made of teen pop Hollywood garbage.I reluctantly agreed to watch it for a while but I became interested after about 15 minutes. The first half I thought was pretty good, until I realized there was still a second half to this. The second half seemed to drag on and I was praying for it to end. The overtime made me frustrated because I thought this was becoming less of a movie and more of a TV series (in terms of length). And than it was over and I realized what an amazing film this was.To keep this short I will tell you that I have directly "forced" about one hundred people to watch this film. The largest group I forced to watch "My sassy girl" occurred during two canceled lectures, students were sitting there bored so I popped this in. The class was made up of different social/racial/gender/whatever cross sections. Everyone watched the first half and they showed up and stayed for the final half the following week, some people even came up to tell me how much they liked it. Only 2 people have given bad responses, one person because he did not finish watching it and the other because she doesn't like watching a film with subtitles.From the rating for this movie it is clear that there are people who hate this film, but if you belong to the other 85% of the population than you will love it.Why did I like this movie? It was a "mystery" movie with clues throughout. They made an entire movie with (basically) two characters. There was no pointless tacked on sex, not even a kiss.Watch the Directors Cut if you can. The movie was actually more enjoyable the second time around. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie shot right to the top of my favorites of all time, at first I where a little uncertain about if I would enjoy a Korean movie, but it put all my expectations to shame and I where captivated through the entire movie. The next day I had to call my close friend and get her over to watch it too.I've since seen it numerous time, both alone and with friends and I have yet to find a person who did not enjoy it as much as me. I only wish I could have never seen it and experience watching it for the first time again.I really can't recommend this movie highly enough and in my opinion it truly belongs on the IMDb top 250 list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best romantic comedy ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can say nothing short of a classic about this movie. My friend recommended this movie who said it was pretty cute. I never really saw a Korean movie but I was interested. I was hooked form the start with the unique style of story telling. I have to admit it that I hate the voices especially the girl. But after half an hour I just forgot it and just sank into this wonderful story.The first half is full of funny scenes(especially the abortion lie).I would just hate the girl for giving the poor, sensitive hero a hard time. Throughout there are subtle hints about her complex character. Both the actors have done exceptionally well but the main attraction is the plot.The soldier in the park scene was a little unnecessary,although I think it helps unravel the girl's strange character. From the second half onwards I start to understand more about the girl and by the end I just loved her amazing spirit. The story unfolds the reasons for her bossy behaviour. At the same time the relationship between them matures. The train scene with the line on the floor was really funny. Towards the end the scenes moves towards pure melodrama - and its been done really nice. The hill top scene was heartbreaking and the "ten rules" was beautiful. I liked the train scene which was funny and moving at the same time. The overtime ties back any broken threads in the story and the sad story of her life is finally revealed.The ending, in my opinion was one of the best ever, which makes you go over the whole movie in your head at that instant. A few pointers of the style of "Serendipity". The Hero is funny and nicely portrays the innocent and kind hearted Gweon-Woo. The beautiful Ji-hyun Jun as the bossy I-am-so-special girl is a nice choice.The main thing I like is that it is not an American romance type movie. I don't really like the American type romance which is focused around sex and complex issues.(Though "Titanic" and "You have got mail" are my favourites). The background score was also top notch. Especially "I believe". The only criticism that can be made is that some of the jokes were vulgar. Otherwise it would be a great family movie. I feel kind of embarrassed watching this in front of my family.A few things which was peculiar about this movie were 1. The girl's name is never mentioned 2. They never kiss On the whole I cannot rate it below 10 by any means. A must-see for any one who loves Romantic movies and every one else TOO!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good movie.. I loved it..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Highly recommended with a warning: do not expect a Hollywood recipe? Brief review: Very funny, yet deep down very romantic. However, the main character -the Sassy Girl- is so scared of falling in love, again, that she never lets any cheesy romantic moment between her and her boyfriend/good friend, also for you.. so guys, come on, sit down and watch and enjoy it. A small reminder, it is a Korean movie and I watched it with English subtitles.The story is about a guy in Korea, who is forced to visit her aunt whom he does not like to visit much and ends up meeting a drunk girl in the subway, whom he carries to a motel room, because she is drunk as a skunk and vomits everywhere. well, he tries to look the other way but feels sorry for her. however, as it is often said, no good deed goes unpunished and he finds himself even in jail because of her, and quite often if i may add. but then again, when she is not drunk, she is a funny and though-looking girl with so much sorrow inside that he can not help bearing whatever she brings to his life.Towards the end of the movie, the characters and their past and future are explored in more details without loosing anything from the funny style. Both lead actor and the actress are good but I think the guy is a little bit better. I loved his reactions, especially during squash games. Not to mention the times he was beaten by his mom (well, eastern society rules, I guess :) ) What about the midnight visit to the fair ground part? Funny..Very nice, very funny, very emotional movie. I think this may be a great Valentine Day movie..Definitely makes you think about destiny, if there is one. I like the definition of destiny in this movie, too.</fullReview>

And after watching it I gotta say that My Sassy Girl is one of the best films I've ever seen. It's an emotional and funny film. And everything that happens in the movie is just so well structured. I don't see why anyone shouldn't give this movie a go even if it is Korean... you will be inspired by it. It'll take you on an emotional roller-coaster which will make you laugh... and cry. This story of Ho-sik Kim is a beauty and he has managed to put it into film and I'm pretty sure that at some point in the movie you will be moved by it because it relates to someone you know, or yourself so well..well at least that's it in my case ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best romantic comedy since Annie Hall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hillariosly funny, occasionally violent and tearfully heart rendering film about love and fate. Anybody who watches this film who is single will be left with such a longing to be in love. Jeon Ji-hyun is beguiling as the deceptively complex sassy girl and Korean pop singer Tae Hyun Cha transcends any doubts about casting a mere pop star in such a role. Korean cinema is unique in its ability to mix tones in a single genre, and this film manges to surf comedy, action, romance, drama and sentimentality without getting lost. I can't imagine a US version pulling this off. There is no need to remake this picture, it is perfect. Though perhaps a remake, no matter how artistically successful, will turn people on to the original. If you want to track this down on Region 3 DVD, there is a director's's cut but I would recommend the shorter version. The extra scenes are great but the pacing is better in the original. If you end up loving this film as much as I do then check out WINDSTRUCK, which was the director's follow up to this and also stars Jeon. It's a bit of a miss-mash but it's worth seeing for the last 2 minutes. You'll understand why!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I'm not as sassy as The Girl. Thus, i provide some reasons for it! Here are the reasons why you should watch "My Sassy Girl"!!!:-it's funny! (the acting, the facial expression,the plot and specially all of my favorite train (barf &amp; bet), motel, theme park, story telling and their parents scenes!)-it's naughty! (the acting by Cha Tae-hyun and part of the editing are TRICKY with a twist of SCI-FI!)-it's beautiful! (the film score, the cinematography, the scenic views and Jun Ji-hyun, of course!)-it's innocent! (the acting and the love between Cha Tae-hyun and Jun Ji-hyun and the beauty of Jun Ji-hyun)-it's crazy! (the series of unexpected events happen in the movie)-it's wacky! (the character which is played by Jun Ji-hyun)-it's natural! (the acting by the cast and the beauty, the compositing, the smile and the tears of Jun Ji-hyun)-it's sweet! (the love, the smile and the interaction between Cha Tae-hyun and Jun Ji-hyun)-it's romantic! (my favorite piano playing Canon in D major scene! this is not your so-called average love story and it's romantic in an unexpected way!)-it's touching! (the score, the movie, mountain, balcony, 10 date rules scenes and the ending that i always weep over for several times!)-it's refreshing! (neither a typical nor ordinary romantic love flick!)-it's superb! it's excellent! it's tremendous! it's fascinating! it's captivating! It's perfect! (the MOVIE, the CAST, the ACTING, the DIRECTOR, the CREW, Jun Ji-hyun, Cha Tae-hyun, their EFFORT, the SCREENPLAY, the MUSIC, the CINEMATOGRAPHY, the ONE-TAKE balcony scene and everything!)-it's SASSY! (explanation is unnecessary because it's SASSY!)-it's LOVE! (well, watch it for yourself!)-it's a CLASSIC! (no doubt due to its uniqueness and originality)-it's a MUST WATCH! (don't ask me why!)-it's my ALL TIME FAVORITE! (i just simply couldn't resist romance movie with a twist of comedy and SCI-FI! Too many favorite scenes inside the movie for me! It's absolutely my pot of Jjigae(Korean steamboat)!) Yum yum!And here is my final advice - Just watch it and stop reading my review if you are a real movie lover! It's absolutely worth to be watched at least 3 times in lifetime. One alone, one with your beloved one and another one to enjoy seeking the hidden details which are nicely set-up by the director! OK, just watch it! Would you?You won't be regret! But if you are regret after watching it, sorry for my terrible obsession with this movie or probably infatuation with Jun Ji-hyun!"I met a man from the future." &amp; "Fate is building a bridge of chance for someone you love." are my favorite quotation from the movie!Strongly and highly recommended! Too bad i can't rate it more than 10 out of 10! (Personally, i don't fancy Hollywood to be able to bring out the feeling and the message by remaking it!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although there were a couple of scenes that didn't quite translate for me, the movie overall was a great romantic comedy. The first two or three encounters, especially, were ripe for laughs. This is a good date movie and one that just about any audience can get into.The repeated chance encounters add something to the standard romantic comedy formula, as does the protagonist's continued willingness to take the girl's abuse. You get the feeling he doesn't quite know why he's taking it, and he doesn't particularly like it, but can't help himself. That's probably as good an analogy of romantic love as any.I'd say this movie is as appealing to women as it is to men; after we watched it my girlfriend knocked me down and kicked me a few times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a romantic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Korean film was unbelievablely popular last year in China, but I didn't see it at that time, because I sort of unconsciously have a dislike to something that nearly everybody else is crazy over.But everybody I knew recommended this film. So I finally decided to see it, this morning, and it won me instantly. I am not a keen fan for romantic comedies, though I do enjoy films like Sleepless in Seattle, You've Got Mail, etc. This film should fall in the same category. The lead roles are brilliant. The girl of the film, you might not like her at start, but as the film goes along she just turns more and more beautiful as you get to know her and her past. The boy, on the other hand, is likeable from the word go (not the handsome type, but quite funny). The comedy is enjoyable and provides some good laughs, but as the film develops into the second hour it just turns so romantic. Of course everybody knows the boy and girl will get together in the end, but the process is really "tormenting". This might not be a great film, but it's truly romantic and great fun to watch. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i have to be honest in this and i'm quite embarrass to admit it but i saw this movie in a pirated copy. i also watch this movie only because of the photo of the leading lady in the vcd's case. she was really beautiful and i think she is a decent girl. unfortunately as expected in pirated copies they are not good. the one i watch had no English subtitles in it. but even though i couldn't understand the language i still proceeded to watch it. it was the best romantic movie i have seen in the last 10 years. it really is worth watching again and again. how i wish they would release this movie w/ English subtitles in the Philippines so that i could add this to my collection of DVD's. it's story is universal and breaks the language barrier...and did i say that the leading lady is very beautiful. i won't get tired saying that over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Questionable Spoilers of My Sassy Girl</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of the points brought out by ClimberL's review were:1) There is a possibility that The Girl's ex boyfriend was not loyal to her. 2) The Girl pushing Gyun-Woo into the water was for a reason. She wanted to save him (who looks like her ex boyfriend) because she lost her ex boyfriend in a drowning incident one year ago. 3) Why is there a frog in the time capsule? Could it be The Girl from the future playing a prank on Gyun-Woo in the present?Analysis of My Sassy Girl by ClimberL can be found here -&gt; http://imdb.com/user/ur1916131/commentsMost of ClimberL's points were pure speculations but they are definitely intelligent and logical ones. Instead of arguing the points are stupid or false, why not offer better explanations than his.Even though this movie was made in 2001, it still stands as one of the best romance/comedy movie churned by Korea. Windstruck on the other hand was not as good as My Sassy Girl. The director may be doomed forever because the audience will always be comparing his new movies with his old hit My Sassy Girl.Mao points: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>i'd never thought Korean movies would be so funny!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first I thought this movie was never that great... Honestly, I picked this movie as my last resort coz I thought it was boring. I just borrowed its DVD from a friend, he said that it's worth my while watching it...Watching it?? I found it hard coz I had to read the English subtitles I am not familiar with Korean languages... And although the leading man was not that cute, he got my eyes on him!! He's not that overacting or whatsoever, his every move was so natural!!And the girl?? The sassy girl??? I love her!! I'm not a lesbian, but I love her!!!I'd say this was the first Korean movie I've ever liked coz I thought that Korean movies are more on dramas, tragedies.. Duh!!Although this movie has a bit of drama.. I loved it!! And I loved every lines that was spoken from them!! It's quite inspirational...So, for guys and gals who are so hopeless romantic like me, I prefer this movie for you to watch!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Witty, Iluminating and Memorable ~!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From out of the blue. Loosely based on a real life experience enclosed from a novel. An atypical restless teenager by the name of Kyun-woo finds himself in a quasi predicament. The other protagonist, universally known as "The Girl" plays a crucial role into elevating the story, character development and the emotional essence which nurtures the plot.My Sassy Girl centres the life of Kyun-woo who meets a sloshed girl where he decides to take custody of her own safety. This is not what you would call an everyday life situation. You're given the consequences when Kyun-woo has the opportunity to either dump or save the girl from a sentient disaster. Just where do you go from here? This is the exciting memento as the subtle comedy elements come into play. How far are you willing to go watch someone be victimized and henpecked through mud and mud? The juxtaposition of both characters personality is relentlessly aided by the natural occurrences in the movie.As a narrative, the film is split into three periods indicated by funky animated texts. From parts 1 to 2 with "overtime" as the finishing climax. The first part introduces the film where we encounter the two as peculiar strangers who attempt to grow accustomed to the situation from their prima facie confrontment. The acting portrayed by the female lead is astounding in terms of bitchiness and refined appearance. It makes you wonder why does Kyun-woo bother to put up with such malice. Her role primarily serves as a foil to counter-act Kyun-woos methodical dim-witted, lazy behaviour. But that doesn't go to say that he's a hopeless pushover. He too has something to live up for despite his inferior control over the relationship.By the half way point, we find ourselves experiencing more lovable fun and comedy for our taste buds. An example thats extraordinarily achieved is where Kyun-woo takes the girl out for a date where he compromises to exchange each others current shoe wear (an ironic act to walking with the girls high-heels). The provocative sparkling humour of mercifulness and innocence instantly brought tears to my eyes.The film's score also contains a brilliant load of harmony and pleasure. A few tracks are frequently recycled to induce that comedic feel of Kyun-woo/the girl's life as a couple. In particular, a piano piece thats excluded from the album renowned as "Pachelbels Canon" provides the most heart-warming notions to the film. As a token, its not the idea of black and white where it's all about seeing an unlikely duo go on a blind date. The purpose is the sentimentalism of the film which shows how humans can understand one another by magnanimity and leniency. Thus, building towards a bizarre yet mutual relationship.In a nutshell, My Sassy Girl is highly recommendable and accessible to audiences who wish to seek a dramatic romcom with much to be desired. It's the unorthodox concept on the characters and plot that combine to create such a fine looking storyline that endorses two lovers to change from who they are at the start and to have high hopes for the future.You may without a doubt have in-satiated cravings for love in moments to come in your lifetime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best romantic comedy I've ever seen!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is proof that making love stories does not have to include raunchy sex scenes and nudity (take notes Hollywood!). This is as heartwarming and affectionate as a movie can get without getting too sappy. The first half of the movie is pure comedy, showing how a hapless boy and an erratic girl get to know each through a series of humorous hangouts. The girl only gives a glimpse of the inner turmoil she suffers in the first half. The second half explore her pain more deeply and also explains why the boy is willing to put up with her outrageous and unpredictable behavior. The last part brings everything full circle.I will also say, this movie is so good because the two lead actors have unbelievable chemistry. Gianna Jun particularly had an Oscar worthy performance and indeed probably would have won an Oscar for a similar performance in a Hollywood film. But sadly this gem of movie hasn't gotten the international attention that it deserves in my opinion. Not just one of the best Korean movies, but one of the best movies ever in any language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In all the Asian comedies i've seenand i have seen a lot this is by far my favorite The way "the girl" acted could sound like shes a complete bitch, but she remains likable during the whole movie. when she bosses kyun around it's hilarious,because you could see that happening.this movie isn't really like American chick flicks, the 2 characters aren't all over each other,and there isn't a major "break up" thing in the middle like some American movies were the couple breaks up and the guy or girl goes beyond measure to get each other back not saying thats bad but its nice to see something different.instead of that the character take a long mutual agreed time apart, and each try to improve themselves for when they finally get back together.and the story about the time machine old guy is creative and makes you wonder if he is from the future. this was based on the blog writings of Kim Ho-sik a korean man, who wrote this of the way he and his girlfriend meet.the ending was very creative and cute.all in all i give it a 11 if possible</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I laughed and laughed and laughed... The movie had a great script. The acting was superb (the actor's facial expressions were excellent!). Comedy and drama were rightfully balanced; and there were a good dose of juicy action scenes, parodies, a pint of sci-fi and a dash of history. Plus, the romance was just the right amount. The movie was basically a plethora of genres. There was also a good twist in the story and the ending was more than satisfactory.although *spoilers* I would have preferred if there was a kiss or two but I could live with just holding hands at the end. lol.The biggest concern though, for North American viewers, would be how they would handle the "slapstick" comedy. the girl constantly hits the male protagonist and this actually served as the major comedy factor. also, I believe there was a lot of Korean and/or Asian culture involved that Western viewers might not appreciate. my only advice is to keep an open-mind when watching the movie and realize that Korean/Asian culture is different from the Western. If you get past that, one would surely enjoy watching this.so, this movie is truly recommended... I'm quite anxious to see the Western adaptation but for sure I would also see that one. BUT, nothing would be able to compare to this movie, not even the remake and the series!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>one of the best foreign language films you will see. The director has paid a lot of attention to detail and there are many hidden goodies in the film that make it worth multiple viewings. it is one of the few films that is funny, dramatic, and romantic at the same time and pulls all this off successfully (i am not a big fan of romantic comedy but this is one that cannot be dismissed). the side characters are carefully placed and, although the film plays on many quirks on modern Korean culture, the emotions and situations can be appreciated universally (I can definitely attest to this being a son of a Korean immigrant to the US and have lived in the gap of the two cultures). it will make you laugh, sigh, and feel uncomfortable compassion for the main character and his situations. this is a definite must see for anyone who can read subtitles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Korean cinema is HOT! Korea is making some good movies nowadays and 'My Sassy Girl' is one of the best. It's very original and wacky. It grabs you from the beginning and never lets you go.When I decided to put this DVD in my player I thought I was going to watch a regular romcom (romantic comedy) but this was not the case. The biggest part of the movie, about 75%, is not a romcom at all although you feel a chemistry between the two players. It begins with a guy and a sassy girl being in funny situations. More a screwball comedy. Then in the end the movie turns into your regular romcom. Nevertheless you enjoyed the movie so much towards the end you don't really care how it finishes. Worse, the chemistry between the actors is so great that you WANT the movie to turn into a romantic comedy.I don't really know how they are going to make an American version out of this (Dreamworks bought the rights) but I hope it will be at least as good as the original. Knowing Hollywood I'm afraid this will not be the case. I'm afraid this script is going to be transformed into a 'teenybopper flick' or it's gonna be a one-in-a-million romcom probably starring Meg Ryan (again). 'My Sassy Girl' (korean version) 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>im not normally a sucker for these comedy-drama types. but on good reviews, i went ahead and ordered the dvd. can i just say...wow? it had a peculiarly muted beginning, but then took off from there. the movie went from light-hearted, to serious, and back, and then back again, all seamlessly. it had a nice progression, slowly building a scenario for the two, and then using recurring themes to bring it together. the whole movie seems to be about dichotomies...its ideologies on past/future and fate/coincidence, not to mention gyun-woo and the girl...her coping with her past, and he looking for his future. the ideologies resonate in your mind long after the movie's over.besides all that though, its just a great movie. her faces scare the crap out of me. i was wondering why in the scene when she springs him from jail and then smacks him around, they cut it short! the full scene was in the trailer (and an extra on the dvd). the subway game scene too, with her rant about the world being for her...that should've stayed! anybody else wonder too, whether at the end of the squash game, gyun-woo was trying to look up her skirt? 3 thumbs up...i got a spare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has moved its way up to one of my favorite movies of all time! I loved the music, especially the Pachelbel Canon which I remember playing as a child. The humor is not bland or crude; it's just right. And throughout the movie, you don't have any gratuitous sex scenes or obligatory sappy romance. Everything fits; it's realistic because it's based on a true story. I thoroughly enjoyed it!I was wondering if any of you knew some parts of the movie that were not included in the OST. I have the song "Big Money" by X Teens, which is when they first enter the nightclub. Then the songs change to a more upbeat rap song. I need to know the title of that one, and then the "l.o.v.e." one right after they emerge from the bathrooms. Great movie!</fullReview>

It's all about what most matters in life. It's simple, it's funny, sometimes even hilarious, it's poetic and deeply touching. It's impossible to control the laughs, but sometimes also the tears. It makes you dream about real love and makes you want to reach out for it. Beautiful and meaning. Just like life should be.Let's go build bridges of chance for love in our lives!

		<shortDescription>and I thought I cannot like a romantic comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of romantic movies, and I really don't understand all that hype for most of the romance classics. And so when I came across this one, I didn't have much expectations. However I decided to check out on IMDb first. Yes I was pretty surprised when I had to figure really hard for one single negative comment for the movie, and that's when I thought of giving this a try.The first time I watched it, there were no subtitles, and being a non-Korean there was not much I was able to make out, however I must say I liked the movie even without the subtitles, at least having a little idea about the storyline and the sequences; what I had imagined and that I watched, were spot on match. And, plus the fact that you really don't need to understand dialogs in order to understand some of its brilliant scenes.It took me two weeks to find a CD with English subtitles, and then I watched it again, and then again.No wonder, This day I do believe that there can be good romantic movies, and this one is a prime example.So where exactly this movie scores where most others fail? and I simply have countless answers to that one question.The storyline is though, simple (and so believable too.), The brilliance of the movie lies in the story telling, that focus on very very little details, the interconnection of events, and more importantly, every single scene having a little unpredictability which in turn leads to a feel-good surprise element. Add to this the fact that both the lead actors are simply marvelous, and fit in perfectly. And their on-screen chemistry? Mindblowing.While most of the movies of this genre I remember, have attempted to create hype over being romantic, attempted to create an artificial environment where you see extra-ordinary people falling in love with extra-ordinary people, have tried to look classy and rich; this one doesn't try to be all that preachy.On the surface what you see is a series of events that mostly appear to be fun, where the guy realizes his inclination towards the girl, even though he has to go through some sort of (in a way) misbehavior by the girl. Under the hood, lie the more deeper emotions, that mostly remain untold, however you can feel them through the bonding the two characters have developed, and yes its those untold things that tell you all about the movie.The unpredictability, the little surprises which are very fresh and novel, give this movie a must-see and must re-see value. And there are plenty of such scenes.Watch out the scene where the guy comes out of the class and asks the girl about what did she say to the professor. That's simply hilarious. You can watch it a thousand times. or check out the scene in the train: the little fun game "hitting each other" ; or the "lets exchange shoes" scene.The attention on details is something that make the story very credible and interesting. And here you'll find lots and lots of very small things scattered over here and there, all somehow connected to the main plot.Remember the first time the girl calls the guy on his cellphone, pay attention to how she might have got his number? Now remember the scene when the guy is checking into the motel, and the old man shoulder-reading every single thing he is filling in. And once you try to figure out who that old man is, you'll find another interesting detail about the quintuplets that keep showing up throughout the movie.Remember the scene in the bar where the girl blasts on the two guys trying a prostitution deal. As they walk out of the bar, moments later if you watch closely, another couple moves out. Now does that relate to the previous incident? You never know.or check out the scene where the guy as a kid, is being punished for getting low grades, and his parents are lecturing him about how to get better grades. Three years later. He is still getting the same punishment; This time however, the dialogs are reversed, and so is the seating positions of his parents.---Yes, of course there are a few sequences that appeared totally unnecessary, a bit draggy, or over the top; The whole runaway soldier story, the "boy/girl from future" talk, or the "ball hitting the head" scene. But as they say, "Those who fail are the ones who try." and so I don't think, that a couple of failed tries can make this movie out of my must-watch list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I try to rank my three favourite Korean romance movies: Hyun-seung Lee's "Il Mare" and Jae-young Kwak's "Classic" and "Yupgi Girl". Although the former two movies are indeed excellent ones in terms of story line and casting, "Yupgi Girl" should no doubt be placed at the top rank. This movie is absolutely entertaining with all key elements of a romance movie having the right balance. Kwak's ability to nicely handle the transformation of the two main characters (Ji-hyun Jun and Tae-hyun Cha) as the movie progresses, together with the movie's excellent melody, further make it a ?must-watch-several-times? classic. It is really amazing that a romance movie can be of such a high quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have worked your way to this IMDb page then congrats, you have found not merely "the" original (before the sequels, and the Chinese and US knockoffs) but, in the opinion of this reviewer, "an" original, in the sense that, having seen a zillion romantic comedies from all other world, I cannot remember a story quite like this one. The charm, the novelty, here is that while the girl is pretty, there is no overt sexiness of any kind. In other words, this is a romantic comedy where the spell is weaved purely on metaphysical or psychological attraction. Maybe the closest analog is the Audrey Hepburn style film. But, this is important, Hepburn was a one of a kind actress; and the premise here, a premise that some reviewers have missed, is that ANY woman has the innate ability to present herself in such a way that men are literally overcome by a strange combination of confusion and desire. That was the premise of the original novel, and this film was faithful to it. I agree with the very first reviewer -- a perfect 10, a one of a kind, sequels and knockoffs notwithstanding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching the movie--"The girl next door",I had developed a crush-- a crush on the charming Elisha Cuthbert.So I decided to search for her other films as well.I came across this film-My sassy girl(2008).As I was about to watch the film,my cousin told me to watch the original movie instead of this one.I had never seen any Korean movie before this,so I was a bit skeptical.But when I saw it ,I really enjoyed every moment of it.I'll not disclose any story or plot here because that will spoil your fun...so I'll enlist a few points about the movie---1.The leading pair is one of the cutest ever seen on screen.Thats what Chemistry between characters is!!2.Innocent &amp; honest effort.3.Some real hilarious moments in 1st half coupled with a brilliant emotional 2nd half.4.The leading female protagonist does full justice to her role &amp; so does Gyeon woo(the boy)I later saw the American version of the film which falls flat before this one.A Bollywood version is also there but its a real disaster...........watch the Korean version for some real good fun!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a cult!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the summer of 2001, South Korean moviegoers went crazy for the romantic comedy "My Sassy Girl (Yeopgijeogin geunyeo)". By year's end, it had become the second-highest grossing film for 2001 (just behind the gangland saga "Friend"), and had earned a place in the record books as the highest grossing Korean comedy in the country's box office history. In February of this year, Dreamworks SKG negotiated the U.S. remake rights for the film, joining "My Wife is a Gangster (Jopog manura)" and "Hi, Dharma" in being the very first Korean films to be picked up by Hollywood for such purposes. And now, after a successful theatrical run in Hong Kong earlier this year, where it topped the box office charts for two weeks straight, the Hong Kong-import VCD of "My Sassy Girl" has finally arrived. With its easy yet unpredictable blend of laugh-out-loud broad comedy, metaphysical romance, and fun characters, "My Sassy Girl" can easily be included among the best that Korean cinema has to offer."My Sassy Girl" is based on an on-line serial written by Kim Ho-sik that detailed his relationship with his off-the-wall college girlfriend. This was eventually compiled into a best-selling book and caught the attention of director Kwak Jae-young, who wrote the script for the film. The story kicks off with college student Kyun-woo (Korean pop singer Cha Tae-hyun, in his feature film debut) crossing paths with a drunk girl (Jun Ji-hyun of "Il Mare") on a late-night subway. Just before she passes out, the girl looks at Kyun-woo and calls him 'honey'. The other passengers, assuming him to be the hapless girl's boyfriend, demand that Kyun-woo look after her. After carrying her on his back for what seems to be miles, Kyun-woo drops the girl off at a motel. But instead of leaving her and getting on his way, Kyun-woo finds himself intrigued by the nameless girl and vows to do whatever he can to heal her sorrow.Unfortunately, he gets far more than he bargained as he becomes wrapped around the finger of this strange girl, whose dramatic mood swings are outmatched only by her penchant for sociopathic behavior. When they dine out and Kyung-woo orders anything but coffee, she barks her mantra "Do you wanna die?" and then promptly changes his order to coffee. When her feet begin aching from walking, she forces Kyung-woo to switch his comfortable running shoes for her high heels. And being a budding screenwriter, she demands that Kyung-woo read her wacky treatments, or else face an ass kicking. However, despite these crazy antics (not to mention landing in jail a few times), Kyun-woo finds himself hopelessly hooked on this 'sassy girl'. And though the girl seems to relish in humiliating and belittling those around her, it becomes clear that underneath the brash exterior is a wounded soul who holds a genuine affection for Kyun-woo.This cleverly scripted comedy covers a lot of territory in its two-hour running time, containing enough material for at least two movies. The film's first half (a fact that is irreverently highlighted with a big bold pastel-colored title) deals with Kyung-woo's initial misadventures with the 'sassy girl' and the absurdity he faces in her company. In addition to the obvious comic set-pieces revolving around the girl's anti-social tendencies, Kwak has some fun visualizing her female-centered film treatments, such as "Terminator Demolitionist", featuring a female warrior from the future gunning down bad guys ? la "The Matrix". Another great gag has Kyung-woo being instructed to drop off her treatment at Shin Cine (the production company behind "My Sassy Girl") and making the suggestion that Han Suk-yu and Shim Eun-ha be cast in the lead roles (for the uninitiated, they are two top Korean box office draws who appeared together in "Christmas in August" and "Tell Me Something").However, as the film moves into its second half (declared with more pastel-colored lettering) and even overtime (check), the bottled-up emotions and vulnerable side of the 'sassy girl' start to reveal themselves, and the film moves into more melodramatic territory, reflecting the growing maturity of the two lead characters. The film even takes a riff from the ever-popular 'love across time' genre (which includes "Ditto", "Failan", and "Il Mare") as the would-be lovers spend some time apart and are reunited by an unexpected and clever plot twist. Despite the more serious mood of this latter half, Kwak manages to avoid the melancholic overkill that permeates the typical Korean romance, while still providing a good enough emotional footing for the story.If there is one really good reason to watch "My Sassy Girl", it would have to be Jun Ji-hyun's turn as the film's unnamed heroine. From her unforgettable first appearance as a wasted commuter, to her rambunctious bullying of Kyun-woo, to the heartbreak she wears on her sleeve, Jun displays an unparalleled level of enthusiasm and dramatic range in portraying a young woman whose domineering exterior is but a smokescreen for her own vulnerability-- it is almost difficult to believe that this same actress who played the quiet and introspective Kim Eun-ju in "Il Mare". As her opposite, the likable Cha Tae-hyun is the perfect comic foil/underdog for Jun's bundle of untamed energy, and his 'constipated' facial expression, when faced with one of her 'outbursts', is priceless.Like the best Korean films, "My Sassy Girl" is a genre-bending exercise that throws in elements of the teen comedy, the traditional melodramatic romance, and even some genre parody and blends them into a unique cinematic experience that defies categorization. The film's original Korean title, Yeopgi, which means 'novelty-seeking', is in reference to the youth craze that was started by Kim Ho-sik's original Internet postings about his eccentric girlfriend. Though the English title for this film doesn't mean quite the same thing, it certainly does tell you what to expect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie exceeded my expectations. It was the first work of Jun Ji-hyun and Cha Tae-Hyun that I saw and I was impressed. I've only seen Cha Tae-Hyun a handful of times and he did not make much of an impression. Jun Ji-hyun, however, gave me an idea of "a pretty girl who can't act" through all the commercials she did. HOWEVER, both the actors in this movie and the plot surprised me because they dared to be "sassy" The only thing I was really disappointed with was the ending. I heard that this was a REAL account of some guy who posted it on internet. I was disappointed to find that the ending didn't follow the truth. In that way, I guess, I can compare it to how disappointed I was with the revised ending of "Great Expectations" by Charles Dickens. I always find that the original story is better- that not everything has to be a fantastic fairytale that ends with a happily ever after... or even a gloomy story that ends with someone dying...</fullReview>

It's not a typical "guys meets girl", "guy looses girl", guy gets girl and fall in love"...... need I say more.. I personally don't believe in fate or destiny, but this movie defies fate, and contradicts my beliefs. Thats why It's so great. If you like watching romantic comedies, I highly recommend it.....If you don't like watching romantic comedies, I gaurantee you It will change your mind....I just hope that the american version will not screw up "my sassy girls" reputation....I can go on with how good it is...just go see it and judge it yourself..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a constant element of surprise, shock, disgust, relief and pleasure in this film, which makes the movie highly entertaining. Quite a contrast to Hollywood movies, comedies or otherwise, whose slapsticks are crude and profane and even the romance movies, are run-of-the-mill. Whenever I watch one, my senses seem to have been so dulled that there are no gasps at the action scenes, no joy or tears at the romance, not much laughter at the comedy. Somehow, the witty American dialogue seems to be contrived and their accompanying gestures very "pose-like". But enough of this, I digress.In an attempt not to echo the posts below, here are some highly memorably scenes from the movie (*spoilers*):When Gyeon-woo first lands in jail, he is placed with a motley bunch of gangsters, dressed in gaudy clothes and covered with bandages. After his release, the camera zooms in on the conversation between the gangsters. The apparent triad leader is scolding a guy for eating a morsel of food not intended for him and gives him 5 sound slaps. Later, Gyeon-woo also suffers the same torture from the girl, without much protest or rebellion, just like the poor gangster. Makes you wonder whether their relationship is like one between a triad leader and subordinate gangster. This is mirrored again in his second time in jail, when the gangsters order him to bow and roll around the floor repeatedly as punishment for rudeness. Just like how the girl treats him, except that he doesn't yell at her in frustration at all. But he has escaped thugs, only to encounter another one outside.....haha...Another memorable scene is when the movie skips to 3 years after their parting, where Gyeon-woo's narrative just ends: I went to the place on the same date 2 years later. But she did not turn up.... After that,I returned to the place frequently....(my translation). Then, the scene focuses on the arched, hunched-back tree and then shows an old man trudging wearily up the hill and sitting back to back against the tree. He's breathing heavily and his eyes are weary. Then he hears a noise, and looks up in anticipation....Haha...That was a really subtly funny scene to me, because I was wondering at first, whether that was an elderly Gyeon-woo still pining away for her and whether the person coming up the slope would be an old lady... But of course, it wasn't... hahaha...The second and third chapters aren't really soppy. They are more in depth and question the characters to examine their conscience and feelings clearly. It's not possible to have the girl hitting Gyeon-woo all the time, as it would mean that she has not grown nor been healed yet. And the parting of 3 years would determine whether their relationship could sustain the passage of time. Which is a mature way of dealing with this, unlike many movies featuring couples, who "fall in love at first sight" and then go to bed and get married and then divorce... Urgghh...spare me...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was recommended to me by some of my friends and family, so I decided to take it on their word. Far from being the typical romantic comedy I thought it was going to be, it filled me with a wide array of emotions. Through the beginning and the middle, the intertwining of charming and funny moments along with the sad and romantic ones gave this film a lighter feeling. I felt the emotions of the characters and would reminisce of times I've felt the same.Toward the end, however, the light, funny moments were replaced by thought-provoking, serious moments. The romance and sadness was apparent on-screen, but much deeper than that, it made me think about my own situations, my own feelings, much akin to the film's. This film does what many romantic/romantic comedies do not - although it IS an impractical situation, it teaches or re-teaches lessons in life that let us grow, mature, and in turn, let's us be more "us" - human.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I LOVE THIS MOVIE. It is a cleverly-made movie. at first, i thought the plot is about destiny, meeting each other... which made the other characters look like 'ornamentals' of a good movie. but if you understand the movie, every character is counted in the story. For me, "My Sassy Girl" is a clever, fantasy, "future", "time travel" movie. with a sidekicked "mini-games" like find the quintuplets in the movie. I watched this movie several times(in fact, i just finished watching this movie at my bandmate's house). The soundtrack fits right into the movie. I like Pachelbel's "Canon in D". the song still rings in my mind. Hollywood surely was amazed. &lt;---this line can rarely be seen in any comments i have seen. (so, back to my topic) i just presume that this is the girl's name... remember the scene where they dress like rural korean people, and Kyun-Woo was a wanted person in that place? they didn't change his name. it was like: WANTED: KYUN-WOO. and Jeon Ji-Hyun was a bounty hunter. watch the dialogue closely. the time when JiHyun defeated KyunWoo. they say that when the time jihyun defeated kyunwoo, they immediately made him king. KING JUNG-JO! so, i thought, until now, that Jung-jo was her name. Pls send me reactions. i'll be glad to read each.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A much stronger movie than I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a beautiful girl meeting a guy by chance on the subway. She terrorises him but their mutual feelings grow day by day."My Sassy Girl" has been marketed as a comedy where the girl does all sorts of terrible things to a guy who is not assertive. I even remember back in the time it was screened in the cinemas, people discussed that if the film was about a guy doing the same to a woman then it would have been classified as abuse and violence. Hence, I had a completely different idea of what "My Sassy Girl" is about.I am pleasantly surprised by the plot, which mixes comedy, romance and drama into one. i laughed so hard at times! The girl has great acting skills as she constantly changes from being a bully, to a gentle lover, to a drunk wreck and to a grieving woman. She navigates through these emotional and behavioural states effortlessly. I am amazed by how touching this film is at the end, and it gives the film a fulfilling closure."My Sassy Girl" is a surprisingly strong movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Sassy Girl Story about a young man who falls in love with a bitchy, sassy, emotional, beautiful young woman. The story is about their relationship which is full of ups and downs. From her hitting and demeaning him to romantic walks and deep conversations. The movie is a fantastic treat for fans of romantic comedy. The movie itself is quite humorous....not entirely my cup of laughs, but the movie has lots of charm and two talented actors who know how to have fun on screen. They both really know how to use their facial expressions.Reading another comment which said there's nothing wrong with it....there are not really many things wrong with this movie. The movie itself was a tad long, but for any fans of romantic comedies it'll fly right by. Him being so subservient to her was a little bothersome as well. These are nitpicking things. The movie was silly, romantic, sad and an overall joy to watch. If you know someone who is looking for a nice romantic comedy, do not hesitate to drop this.Another gem from Korea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Upgraded version of 'Sketch of Mimi and Cheolsu's young days'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In late 80's two young filmmakers showed films which treated the pure love between a college boy and girl. One is LEE Kyu-Hyoung and his is 'Sketch of Mimi and Cheolsu's young days'(1986) and the other is KWAK Jae-Yong and 'Water Painting in a Rainy Day'(1989). They share the value of purity and goodness of human nature, and focus on expressing this feeling. And, the fan of their film was Korean teens who are very curious about the life of Korean college man. But college students did not see their movies because they thought that their films did not reflect the real situation of 80s Korean college culture under military dictatorship. So these two filmmakers were almost forgotten through 90s.But in 21st century, as the consummerism rises in South Korea and the rigidity in college relatively disappears, the romanticism and sentimentalism spreads, which makes the director KWAK Jae-Yong return to Korean film industry.The character in 'Sassy' is very similar to 'Sketch of Mimi and 'Cheolsu...', in which KANG Su-Yeon took a role of tough girl and PARK Jung-Hun, who is Detective WOO in Nowhere to Hide, a sensitive boy. The subversive pleasure of two films is almost the same - the reversal of power relation between male and female.And the shot in which a tree on a hill reminds me of some scenes in 'Water Painting...', in which OK So-Ree did water painting on a hill. The director still sticks to the theme of purity of human soul and nature and relate it to Korean Nature - a hill and a mountain.I agree with reviews that this film is very romantic and funny. I just try to explain the context and genealogy of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Wanna Die?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Korea is a wonderfully odd place for a westerner. I have lived here for a while and have learned the language to some degree. There is great innocence and great frankness in the society. It usually comes from a place of innocence and good intentions and those good intentions allow one to say things that might get you slugged if you didn't mean well. Directness, be it positive or negative, is valued in ways that often shock westerners and leave us baffled. This film is exhibit A in that sort of baffling mix of bluntness and sweetness.This movie is hilarious, with two great leads in Gianna Jun as the girl and Tae Hyeon Cha as her suitor Kim Woo. They really make the movie. Cha is sweet and really clueless and must seem, to The Girl (Gianna's character is never given a name beyond that) like nothing more than a mouse with which she, the cat, can play. Having said that, she is still a woman and wants him to be chivalrous, even while she tests him as few women will. The Girl's character is more than a little messed up, owing to some previous relationships. It's a great character and a star-making turn for her, giving her the chance to show great range as an actress. We see her as needy, as strong, as feminine, as sarcastic, and as very funny. The script, by Ho-sik Kim based on events in his life. It was adapted by him and director Jaeyoung Kwak who do a great job in keeping the characters likable in spite of some sharp twists and turns. There's some good supporting work from Kym Woo's parents (Sook Song Kwak and In Mun Kim) also. This really is a fun romantic comedy about the power of love. If you like Hollywood cookie cutter romances this isn't for you, but if you're willing to see other modes of expressing romance, this movie will reward you.</fullReview>

It is about 2 people meeting under strange circumstances and what comes of it.Gianna Jun along with Tae-hyun Cha give an excellent performance. I used to think that korean cinema(followed by Chinese first and Japanese after) were the masters of police dramas and that was all but after seeing this movie,the first movie from Jae-young Kwak that I watch, I got a clearer view.These are movies addressed to our souls.The people that play,the characters they create they all have souls and they make sure we get the grasp of them from the start to the end with the most vivid way. No more to say,cause only you watching this will make you understand those feelings. 10/10 and I hope I see more of those actors and director in the future.p.s.I am not gonna watch the American remake of this.A remake of this movie makes no sense,furthermore an American one.Don't ruin those movies please!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Inspired from the true story of an individual who described his relationship with his girlfriend on the internet which was later adapted into a book, My Sassy Girl tells the story of Kyun-woo; a young bloke who happens to meet our unnamed girl &amp; after assisting her once develops a deep sense of responsibility for her and while enduring her crazy behaviour eventually ends up falling for her. I'm not a big fan of romance genre but My Sassy Girl was a fresh &amp; fun experience, nonetheless.Entertaining throughout its runtime, hilarious to most extent, heartwarming in bits &amp; uplifted to a much better status solely by the show-stealing performance by actress Jeon Ji-Hyeon, My Sassy Girl comes with its share of flaws but is still a better romantic story done when compared to what Hollywood churns out most of the time.Honestly directed, brilliantly written &amp; superbly performed although it did slow down for few moments in the second half, My Sassy Girl is a pleasing adaptation of a true life story and is a refreshing change to come out from South Korean cinema industry which is more notorious for its violent revenge thrillers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So deep and touching that I could drown in a pool filled with tickles and my own tears</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey guys, this is my first review of any movie but I really want to share with you my experience with this movie.As I was laying around on my brother's couch at 2 AM watching movies on a Roku, I came across this movie. Instead of immediately selecting My Sassy Girl due to its high ratings, I went online to search for others because the title didn't cut it for me. I thought hands down it'd be a terribly cheesy romantic movie because of its title and the movie cover. Well after coming to IMDb and seeing reviews that some of you have written, I decided to give it a shot. If it isn't good then I'd fall asleep as it ends. When it did end I had spent an extra hour looking up the "real" story behind it. And it was the seventh time I have watched it before writing this review.There are two versions, uncut and director's cut. I recommend watching the uncut one since it has quite a bit of scenes that I feel added more substance to the story. And the music for them was also different; the original uncut one uses "My Girl" by The Temptations instead of a Korean song.Review: My Sassy Girl by Jae-young Kwak I can say without a doubt that this movie will be unforgettable. Not because it may be the only foreign film you'd watch or the fact that it has been mostly praised by others. This film is touching but it needs time to build. Most of the film is based on many awkward occurrences between the two main characters portrayed perfectly by Tae-hyun Cha and Gianna Jun to resemble a friendzone-like relationship after meeting oddly. The first half of the movie will set up Cha's character's background and scenes where the two spend time just messing around. For the second half, you'll start to see how their friendship forms into a relationship where they start falling for each other and Jun's character's history. As you watch this, try to analyze each of the scenes and decipher them for yourself. It makes the watching experience more enjoyable.Give some credit to the director because even with this high caliber story, it wouldn't reach international recognition without the directing. I love how Kwak hints at both characters' histories while telling the story -- I haven't seen many movies that have been executed as well as this one. The setting, music and costumes all tie in nicely. Each scene slowly builds up to this deeply touching finale, so pay attention to each detail (i.e. Gianna's reluctant attitude beginning at the coffee shop; after agreeing to talk formally to Tae-hyun, she gets up by placing her hand on his thigh meaning that they are starting to get along, the rain scene her eyes unconsciously placed onto his lips awaiting a kiss, etc.). The music really helped display emotions between scenes. It wasn't overblown or overplayed and if you pay attention closely, you'll realize that each song had its own purpose to display a certain relationship between the characters. For example, "Episode 1" was played whenever we see characteristics that the two may seem like they were destined for each other (i.e he can still be loyal after dealing with her attitude and she has the body type that he likes). Again, I really admire Jae-young Kwak's work on this movie.Tae-hyun Cha (the guy) and Gianna Jun (the girl) had acted superbly and it's no wonder they both won awards for best actor/actress. It was deeply touching to see Gianna's character develop throughout the movie so well. Tae-hyun's character's change wasn't as radical, still he acted very well throughout it all. He's no charming prince... or is he? Critique these two characters however you'd like but the actual actors didn't let up on bringing the characters to life. Congrats to Gianna Jun and Tae-hyun Cha and keep up the work! The only complaints I have for this movie are just minor details of continuity mistakes in the movie editing like the girl's piano playing was not in sync with the music; or during the girl's shooting scene, she uses a shotgun to blow up a explosive can about thirty to forty yards away (there was also a scene in the same act where she aims straight and shoots at two guys -- right then left -- but the one on the car dies before the one standing on the right). Also one version had no dialogue between the girl and her mom when Tae-hyun gets kicked out of the girl's house.I wished that the director and screenwriters made this movie a little longer by adding more scenes of the two after they were forced to split up or in the epilogue to show how much of a difference it made when they were not together.BIGGEST SPOILER EVER: Ho-sik Kim was the one who came up with this admittedly fictional story (source: http://k.daum.net/qna/view.html?qid=3O73F). This had hit me hard because as I was watching the movie I could imagine the feelings that the writer had to overcome until the epilogue. I had only found out after watching the film and reading his blog that all of it was fictional. Terrible way to end it all, but that's the truth. Although it was not real, I did indeed enjoy this movie and reading English translations of his blog. I'd recommend watching the movie first and then reading his blog if you really want to enrich your movie experience. I believe the movie adaptation by Jae-young Kwak is better than Ho-sik Kim's online blog but Kim's story is more believable. Still I give these guys the honor of topping my list for best foreign romantic comedy (very prestigious honor). I give my thanks to those of you reading this and the entire crew to bestow this unbelievable film (pun intended).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a compassionate film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a collection of true stories that were posted on the Internet by author Kim Ho-sik and then later turned into a film by one of South Korea's biggest movie directors Kwak Jae-young, My Sassy Girl (Yeopgijeogin Geunyeo) has received numerous awards and attention since its release in 2001, including a 2008 Hollywood remake, a Japanese television drama and being given the Bollywood treatment. My Sassy Girl is a compassionate film with both a humane message and humane characters. Almost every scene in the film gives the viewers something to laugh, cry, or think about. There are no moments of silence or dead air, and every act within the film carries its own heart-warming blend of physical comedy, straight melodrama and emotional highs. LS</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beauty of simplicity....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this is my most favorite movie in the Romantic-Comedy genre. This is the first Korean movie I saw and without any expectation. The next day after watching the movie I called up my friends and showed them the movie, next i sent a DVD back home and finally showed the movie to my girl friend. 10 on 10 on all accounts. What makes this movie so great is its simplicity. This movie has two characters and two characters only. A boy whom you want to beat up for his stupidity but you keep on finding your own self in that character and a girl whom you hate for her actions but still cant help falling in love with her. Oh there are other characters, but they are nothing more than a guest appearance. Therein lies the beauty of the movie. No complex plot, or twists and turns. Just a common everyday life of that boy and that girl.There is something special about this movie. Watch it the first time and you'll love it. The movie will sink in slowly. And even after its over, you'll be thinking about it and then it will sink in some more. Now trust me and watch the movie a second time. Now you'll start seeing things that you missed the first time and now you are starting to get the movie. Every time you watch the movie you find something you missed the previous time.Now the movie is based on real life internet posts written by a korean guy Ho-sik Kim about the time he spent with his girl friend. By the end of the movie you will wish this guy all the luck.WORD OF CAUTION: Watch this movie without thinking about the reviews. This movie has some great reviews which might lead you to expect too much from this movie. Again, the beauty of this movie is in its simplicity. The simplicity might be lost beyond towering expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a must watch. It's based on a real story, where a guy's life, Gyun Woo, changes after meeting drunken girl, Ji Hyeon, in the train station. He saves her falling toward the train in the subway, and ends up having to take care of her. That night, after that day, day after that, sounds fun doesn't it? It didn't sound so fun to him when he gets slapped, punched, cussed at, and forced to do stuff. Such as changing high heels with her to make her happy and bringing rose to the only girl school on their anniversary even if he was embarrassed to do it. I guess he wasn't really forced to, but he did it to make her happy. This movie is really popular in Korea, even though it came out in 2001. Currently they are making a remake of this movie in American version. It's a love story, with lots of comedy, but with some sad parts, like when the girl leaves the guy because he reminds her of her ex boyfriend who died. If you haven't watched this movie, I strongly recommend it, even if you don't like love stories, you would like all the comedy and the story of the movie. If you want to watch the movie, you could watch it here: &lt; http://www.crunchyroll.com/showseriesmedia?id=1255&gt;.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it's such a wonderful movie but details make the movie better.In the beginning the Kyun-woo sees a girl in the street but at that moment his phone rang so he missed the opportunity to talk that girl but after leaving the police station he saw that girl(girl in red)but didn't talk.Like he had to meet some other girl.Also in subway scene she got off the train then missed it..Also Kyun-woo got off the train.Then the girl misses a bus this time and wanted to take a taxi but taxi had a crash too.As we see like they have to meet each other.At that time Kyun-woo eating smtn with his friends saying"i don't wanna be with that girl"then he saw a girl out of the restaurant and wanted to meet her... and again he met the girl....cos it's their destiny.also we found out that Kyun-woo is her ex-bf's cousin anyway.Kyun-woo's aunt wanter him to meet a girl but he didn't want to but in the end he met the girl anyway which was destiny.Durin the movie Kyun-woo had to deal some stupid things which made me him seen"unlucky" like he used his money to get in subway but officer saw him and he had to buy a ticket again or the hotel owner had so many children and demanded more money and the room Kyun-woo took was so upstairs or that condom scene.. but he was not unlucky behind these things he was so lucky cos found the girl.when we saw the old guy under the tree we felt like"Kyun-woo waited the girl for years and years"then we realized that was not him.. so the director finished the movie with two endings with it..he meant to say"Kyun-woo is such a person who can wait for her"also that scene Kyun-woo forced to wear the girl's shoes" that scene represented what kinda things we can do when we are fall in love or how can we be childish.. it was great too..also after breakin up Kyun-woo did such great things he wrote a book,learnt how to swim.... he made himself cultivated.and the final scene there was no talking which was so great.All South-Korean movies have beautiful,surprising ends.even an average movie ends beautifully and makes the move better.not like American ones u know... greetings to South-Korean people ........</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silence ! I kill you !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Does that line sound familiar ? Well, it's the best way i can describe the girl playing the "terrorist" exercising her moves on her newly met friend. There's 3 things that bug me...1: is she acting like this only to test his loyalty to her or, is she doing it just for laughs, or her acting is the result of a bad experience considering the aftermath of her previous relationship ? The movie doesn't answer any of those questions but leaves the viewer's imagination wonder, it gives us the freedom to speculate, freely. The movie portrays an exceptional blend of tragedy and comedy in high doses, one moment you find yourself laughing your a** off and the next you find yourself crying your eyes out. It's like someone's playing with your feelings by setting the rules in opposition while you're jumping from one foot to the next like a jack in the box not knowing what to make of the 2 main characters especially the girl. Or if this were for real, you probably wouldn't know what to make of what's happening around you. Probably. Why did the guy take all that abuse from the girl even though mild in terms of brutality, a couple of slaps here a couple a slaps there, a punch here another one there, one (or more)major hit(s) in the face, i'll never understand, but i can only guess. Anyway, what's keeping this picture together is the acting which is outstandingly done, and what's more it has a rare "scent" to it. I mean how many of us can honestly say that "my girlfriend is this majorly bitch that bullies me whenever she feels like it but i still can't brake up with her" ? It's a simple yet complex story, unique even told on a linear level between 2 people that accidentally as fate has it are destined to meet each other in odd VERY ODD circumstances, only to experience a so-called relationship that apparently doesn't stand on its own and yet its savior is the essence of the story itself as it unfolds. Odd, isn't it ? Watch this wonderful piece of cinematography and you'll likely to get the point. Thank God I don't have a girlfriend like that, but then again...... Solid 10/10P.S For anyone who is interested in having a copy of the original story as posted on the internet by Ho-Sik kim, the author who experienced it all in reality, there is an on-going translation of the guy's work made by bumfromkorea. He's up to chapter 12 so far out of the 33 in all, and his work is highly appreciated especially for the fact that he's doing it pro-buono. Copy/paste rules :) Thanks bumfromkorea your work is one of a kind. Just look up the user comments and you'll find his translation there. I would very much appreciate it if the P.S part would be considered as an addition to the original comment instead of a replacement, since i edited it. Thank you.</fullReview>

It totally freaked me out (i thought it was "kyun-woo" at his old age) and it made really sad. But within few seconds the girl showed up !!!! ooh it was such a relief.

		<fullReview>This movie(My Sassy Girl / Yeopgijeogin Geunyeo) was awesome.After i saw this i was speechless for sometime. I have seen several Korean,Chinese and Japanese movies but none of them were ever a love story or a romantic comedy.I have seen 1000s of romantic movies(both from Hollywood and Bollywood) but none of them come anywhere close to this... The lead actor was superb(very cute).His acting was great.The script was awesome,especially the fact that the lead actress is known only as The Girl. Also,the most frequently used lines were "Wanna Die?" and "Otherwise,I Will Kill You". The way the main characters separate and come together each time was shot beautifully. Another thing left to talk about is how the movie is "real-life" like and how "down-to-earth" and "humane" the characters were. Watch this movie.Otherwise,its your loss. I have to say that this is the best romantic movie ever made.Only one word to describe this,BEAUTIFUL.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some good movies which you like, some you enjoy and some which you want to watch over and over again. 'My sassy girl' is all that and more. It's easily my favourite romantic comedy or should I a say 'South Korean Melodrama'..The film has it's romantic moments, it's funny moments and yeah excellent twists and turns too, but the best part is the innocence of the two characters. That kind of purity in character is seldom captured on screen, either it becomes too mushy or becomes over-dramatic, here it's just right!! Both the lead characters have played their parts exceedingly well, not to forget the amazing direction and the fantastic use of the soundtrack 'My girl' by Temptations, it just connects.Watch this movie which is already on it's way to be a classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is my favorite movie of all time. It goes under all of the movie categories. It's a romantic tragdomedy (tragdedy/comedy) I believe that anyone who sees this movie will be quite moved by it. It is about a college boy, who has a crazy and troubled history, who meets a drunk girl on the subway. Her feet are on the edge of the subway, where she could be hurt, but the boy pulls her away quickly before the train can hurt her. I don't want to spoil anything, so this is as far as it is going to go.I suggest that you see the trailer, found at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZQCHWOM9bwIf you would be interested in watching this movie without having to order it or anything, you can watch it on YouTube, here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLZW2No4dT0 It has 14 ten minute parts to it, and after each segment is finished, you should press the next segment to see the rest. EX. At the end of part 1/14, watch 2/14. At the end of 2/14, watch 3/14. Simple. Also, it is in Korean with English subtitles. It's a great movie, and it would be a time well spent to watch it. I hope you enjoy it!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERISH!!! (i wouldnt call it a spoiler but at least you have my warning) I dont think it is possible to spoil this a good movie.When a movie makes you feel strongly about it for days, then you have seen a good movie. The world would be a better place if movies like this were more common. I think this is a movie that many ppl can enjoy, because its funny (not very funny though), and also it makes a strong emotional impression (at least it did on me). The first 2/3 part of the movie is mainly a comedy, but contributes greatly to the ending, which almost made me cry. It altered my view upon people, in particular girls. It can somewhat clarify the "strange" behavior of girls encountered in real life. If you think the beginning is cheap entertainment, just enjoy it, and wait for the rest of the movie! One of the best movies i have seen... this one together with "strokes of fire" and "oasis", has made me really interested in Korean movies!By the way... Jeon Ji Hyun herself makes the movie worthwhile with her beauty, rich facial expressions and acting.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I got sunshine on a cloudy day....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based off a true story posted on the internet (later a novel), My Sassy Girl is about a rather underachieving college kid who accidentally meets this one odd girl in a subway, who through various silly situations, winds up becoming his girlfriend. My short fiction professor often said one of the good indicators of a well-written (esp. in a short) story is that the characters will go through some form of change in the story due to an event or a situation. They become better or worse people as a result. But, there's always change (and must be a believable one at that). And, those kind of things make a character interesting (as they are challenged) and three-dimensional. That said, it is also one of things you rarely see in modern action movies (John Woo's HK movies excluded) and romantic comedies these days. That said, one of the many things I really dug about My Sassy Girl is the way the characters progress. (Spider-Man is also another good one, given the fact it's an action movie) Throughout the movie, the director expertly throws various hints and ideas that there's more to it than meets the first eye (if that's a proper term).Indeed, My Sassy Girl is a romantic comedy. It is also a bit of drama, mystery, character study, and a bit of other things. I think we as movie-goers (perhaps more so in terms of Hollywood movies) have a tendency to feel a movie should operate within the confines of a given genre. If not, we sometimes feel the movie did not succeed as a movie should, for we generally want to get what we hoped to expect. But, I think we should also look at the movie as it is..a movie. Genre-pieces tend to be safe, have lots of "wink wink" homages to the genre, yet most often, pretty monotonous, and predictable. That said, when I first saw "My Sassy Girl," I certainly expected a certain kind of movie, with a certain kind of expectation. (To note, I tend to dislike romantic comedies, because: they are not funny, are not meant to be funny, except "cute." Women tend to generally like romantic comedies more than men, and even when asked what they thought of it, their answer is usually this: "It's cute." We men don't mind "cute" really, but we could probably get the same fuzzy feeling watching Eewoks in Return of the Jedi, or Smigol in LOTR) Anyway, that said, as I watched the first 10 minutes, I was almost ready to dub "My Sassy Girl," the worst movie of the year 2001. It was pretty cool I had such low expectations, however, as I slowly came to a realization that the movie, other than being easily hilarious, was quite thoughtful, unexpected, intricate, and easily one of the most joyously clever movies in a long time (certainly one of the best of 2001). That said, I now have the DVD and still watch it often (repeated viewings, a must) and become a romantic sap every time. I also got my friends (and many of them are guys) hooked to it.. This may just be a gateway drug to Korean Cinema (like John Woo's "The Killer" was a gateway drug to Hong Kong Cinema in the early 90's), although not a gateway drug to the romantic comedy genre (it still doesn't change the fact that Hollywood romantic comedies will not have anything new or deep to offer). But, don't let my hype fool you. I'd hate for people to see this movie with unrealistic expectations. It's important to note, I did indeed first watch it with low expectations.I think people who expected MSG to be a straight-out comedy (as opposed to romantic comedy) and becoming disappointed finding romantic (even sad) elements afterwards could be from a bias developed from years of watching many "unfunny" romantic comedies (basically, the idea that if a movie is actually "funny," the movie is probably just a straight-out comedy, not romantic comedy, and should follow those conventions thereof). On the contrary, the movie, like a lot of good, fleshed-out movies, delivers a variety of emotions, as opposed to just one. On that note, as many increasingly popular modern one-phrase commentary critics would say, "ThIs MoViE rOcKs!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this movie and feel fortunate to have had the chance to see it given that it is not available in the US or UK as yet. I hope that it becomes available soon. I think that the reason I liked it so much was how hopeful it is. It took the theme of fate bringing people together and gave it an unusual twist, in that many times the main characters missed each other by accident when looking for each other, but in the end we see that something (or someone) had been trying to bring them together through it all. It's also an extremely funny movie mostly because of the lead actor's reactions to the abuse laid on his character by the women in his life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Korea Cinema At Its Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are certain movies that pull me in as strongly as it did this one. Granted there are flaws that may make this film less than perfect (South Korean society with women and men), but it still sits pretty above some of the best romantic comedies of all time with me. My Sassy Girl makes the mushiness that exists in romantic dramas go away for at least the first hour of the film and turns it into comedy relief.It is truly unique how this movie blends comedy with romance and leaves the viewer wanting more all the way till it ends. The references made throughout the movie are symbolic and refreshing that I thought was lost in movies in this category for a long time. All in all, it becomes an ecletic mix of foreign beauty mixed in with a dash of love and innocence."The Girl" is impressive, who's eccentric personality does nothing but make the viewer like her more and more. Her performance along with Kyun-Woo is pure chemistry from the start.Highly Recommended 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an absolutely wonderful film. I have seen the original version on screen and have the director's cut on DVD and recommend this to anyone - not just Korean (or more general Asian) film afficionados. The storyline is told with a rather sharp wit, such that it hardly seems likely to morph itself into a true romantic comedy - but it does so, and very effectively. The leads in this film are very good - probably more so with their expressions and body language than with the dialogue itself.It bothers me to hear that Dreamworks is planning a remake of this film. No doubt they will strip it of its original charm - much of which comes from its cultural context. Korea has produced some truly hilarious comedies (e.g., "My Wife is a Gangster") - it is truly sad that 99% of Americans will not have the opportunity to see these gems in their original form. It is also a slap in the face of the fine Korean actors and actresses who made these wonderful stories come to life on the big screen. If you haven't yet seen this film, buy a DVD copy off of eBay and enjoy the original versions before Hollywood ruins them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPOILERS!!! and I thought I hated romantic comedies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS!!!I hate romantic comedies. I abhor them. Keep that in mind as you read this: I LOVE this film. The comedic moments have teeth, the set ups are sublime, the story has beats within beats and the film is reward upon reward for patience, attention and acceptance, nigh, surrender to its reversals on all conventions relevant to the genre. The leads are atypical casting choices that help to sell the characters to the hilt. The films within film actualization of the girl's scripts are sheer genius. The film's tangents and recurrent gags are delicious. I could go on for hours, really. Damn. And here again, a bonding through bile moment, although this is perhaps the most hilarious chuck scene I've ever seen, and that is saying something considering how many I have seen. At least on par with Caddy Shack without being completely beyond realism like Bad Taste. In other words, apparently not everyone chews ramen before they swallow it, and toupees are not nearly as moisture absorbent as I'd initially reckoned. Amen.burning question, was the soup still warm?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the first time i seen this movie, i was like..what is up with this girl? she throws up in a subway train on this guy's which he had a hair piece on and she even threw up on his head. the guy, gyun-woo, was actually really cute. yeah he was such a push-over but it was sweet of him to take care of her when she was drunk. i mean she basically beats the s*** out of him throughout the movie.and it was weird how she treats him but likes him also. and i can't believe they didn't even kiss! i mean they were real close to kissing in the rain by her door. and it was sad how she wanted to make gyun-woo act like her ex fiance. it was really sad how when gyun-woo went to the girl and her date's date..gyun-woo told him those 10 things he should remember when dating her. i mean he practically did everything she wanted and she was really rude to him most of the time. but i thought one of the sweetest scenes was when it was their 100 day aniversary. gyun-woo brought her a rose in the middle of her class and she played this piano song that he really liked. it was sweet cuz they were up on stage and just stared into each others eyes and everyone clapped. that was so sweet!! also. how did that frog get into that egg shaped time capsule thing when gyun-woo opened it?? LOL! it scared him and it scared me too. LOL! i watched it twice only but i have the movie so i can watch it whenever i want. i have to go watch it again. i love this movie so much. the best korean movie i've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my favorite Korean movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that My Sassy Girl was one of the greatest movie i had ever seen. My sassy girl was about a boy and a girl who meet at a subway station. The girls acting was really good it looked like she was really crying. The movie had a good plot and excellent twists. When she was with her blind date when she went to the bathroom her close friend told the blind date ten rules to get her he was unselfish that moment really touched me. This movie was a sad romantic comedy this movie was the best Korean movie of all time to me. My sassy girl was split into three part the first part was really funny because he got sent to jail because after he took a shower he went to get towels then the girl was on the bed and he was naked.Part two was the sad part when he told the blind date ten rules for him to follow to win her heart.That part was one of the saddest scene in the movie. The third part was the romantic part with the time capsule and what they felt about each other but they said true love you will always find that person no matter what and at the end the aunt put them together and thats when the knew that they were destined to be together. I really recommend this movie if you like romantic comedies</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you see one foreign language film in your lifetime, see this one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a shame that this film's Home Video covers portray such a silly looking image that belies the true nature of this outstanding film. Don't be turned off by those covers or the fact that it's a foreign language film! This is an outstanding film by any measure. It combines the kind of detail, twists, and acting prowess normally seen in art-house pics with a kind of pop culture accessibility. That's really just a way of saying that pretty much everyone can find thing(s) to love about this film.Gyeon-woo is a hopeless student with no direction in his life. One day he saves a drunk girl in the subway and after an unfortunate incident ends up dragging her to a motel. From there they hit it off but their relationship is far from normal. She tries to find her ex-boyfriend in him. He recognizes her hidden pain and tries to help, occasional enduring her abuses. This continues until the two find that they've fallen for each other.I realize such a brief summary makes the film sound like any other romantic comedy out there, but I assure you there's a ton of depth to be found. There's lots of tiny details that you might think of as trivial the first time around, but by the end you'll be wanting to watch the film again just to find all the easter eggs.The two leads play their role to absolute perfection. Cha Tae-hyun does a wonderful job as Gyeon-woo in portraying the hopeless kid who matures in front of us. He adds just a bit of over-the-top sauce to his character which just makes him even more hilarious but not to the point where it strains believability. As for the Girl? Jun Ji-Hyun takes a very complicated (sometimes downright violent) character and makes her as endearing as any Audrey Hepburn character you can think of. She slips flawlessly between a wide array of emotions from anger to sorrow to regret to joy and so on. None of it is overacted or stiff. Her performance is... perfect for lack of a better word. This film turned her into one of Asia's biggest stars and it's pretty easy to see why.At over 2 hours in length, it might seem overly long for a romantic comedy, but I assure you that those 2 hours fly by very quickly. The pacing is just right and no scenes are wasted. The soundtrack is ever-present but not distracting; it does a great job of enhancing the film.Ultimately, if you see one foreign language film in your lifetime, see this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While Hollywood has been glorifying the American bay boys for decades, it is nice to finally see a romantic film for the rest of us. Hilarious and sweet at the same time, the movie details the relationship between a very sensitive young man and a girl he met on the subway. Both lead characters exhibit contradicting personalities - the boy sensitive yet protective, whereas the girl sassy yet vulnerable. A perfect mismatch made in heaven, this is a truly innocent love story. This movie was big in East Asia, because it appeals to the young teens and the young teens still in us. Sappy at times and drags a bit with some unnecessary scenes, but still a wonderful movie nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was under impression that in a romantic comedy the viewer is supposed to like the leads. But both of the main characters are so unsympathetic they made me want to puke (the only part of the movie I could emphasize with). The man is a snivelling piece of snot, and the female character is basically defined by her obnoxiousness, which we are supposed to excuse because she's so cute. Just imagine a movie in which the gender roles where reversed, and the boy kept slapping and abusing his girlfriend? How would you expect that movie to end? Not with a loving reconciliation, that's for certain - more probably with the woman shooting her abuser - just look at the recent "battered wife" movies like "Enough" and "High Crimes".The only audience that should find Sassy Girl appealing are S&amp;M enthusiasts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow where to begin, I am not a native Korean, I do not understand the culture nor the language so for me, a full dive in to something like this was pretty nervy, and to be honest 10 minutes in to the movie I was regretting my decision, but as the movie progressed, I became attached. I was liking it fairly. the Movie had it all. The main actor was not someone I normally see in movies, he didn't even look like he was right for the part but as the movie progressed even he made me smile, laugh, upset, and angry. He is a wonderful actor, do not let the beginning fool you, as for the lady, wow, she was amazing, I really think she nailed every part in that movie. The story - boy meets girl? yes... but there is so much more. You can't help but get attracted to them, some times you want to choose sides but you end up likening them as equally. the movie makes you cry in some parts (well done Jun Ji Hyun) the movie makes you laugh in so many places (both as funny in that) the movie makes you smile, warm, happy and the ending leaves you very satisfied, yes the old man is tad confusing but you forgive the mistakes and pretend it doesn't happen. Some really cheesy line. but you like them, the 10 rules is really sweet and you think to yourself it's cheesy but you would still like it. You start to think some parts drag on and they do, but you would more than likely start watching more Korean movies you you give this one a full watch.I started this movie years back, it's still among my best, the "prequel" that isn't a prequel is again some really amazing acting but No way close as good as this movie. It's truly a magical movie. the first watch is always the best but gosh you can watch it 4 or 5 times in one day and still feel it's worth.</fullReview>

But the final part of the movie is so amazing. I might have been stupid and not seen it coming, but the way the narrative is structured, the writer made a big effort to have people not see it coming. The ending really made the movie so amazing and I think that is such a hard feat. But they did it. Watch this movie to the end. It make the whole thing amazing.

		<fullReview>This is my third time watching this movie and I finally decided to write a review.This is one such movie that you can go for when your mood is down and you want to watch a feel good movie. RomCom at its best. The lead actress Jun Ji-hyun does a fabulous job in portraying "The Girl". Cha Tae-hyun is funny and fits smoothly in his character. Even after so many years this movie remains one of the highest grosser movie of all time in Korea.I must say Koreans are too damn good when it comes to depicting emotions. P.S : For those who don't know Windstruck is like a prequel to this movie with the same actress in lead. The final scene in Windstruck kind of joins both the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lovely romantic comedy with mixed emotions and a very nice story and the performances of the lead pair keeps you engaged throughout the movie. The movie is based on a plain and simple plot ie. boy meets girls. Falls for each other, but they got separated each other on one condition that they will after two years. The way the director portrayed was simply beautiful and poetic. The lead actors were too good and was the fuel of this love saga. A complete fun filled crazy romance with a shade of some sorrow. My Sassy Girl is different in its narration and execution, told in 3 episodes and 3 stages and with brilliant dialogues. The songs played in the backdrop of the movie was soothing.

		<shortDescription>My Sassy Girl : This Kwak Jae-Yong film presents a positive image of a Korean woman.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is true that women in South Korea have experienced great social changes in recent years but a lot needs to be done to completely change public perception which prevails due to the sexist mindset of South Korean society. If one were to watch 'My Sassy Girl' in the context of views stated above, any viewer would notice that this film portrays a very positive image of a Korean woman. It is one of the very few films which shows a south Korean woman as domineering. For a film which lasts 2 hours, director Kwak Jae-Yong focused on making it an absolutely entertaining flick with numerous elements of South Korean culture. Anybody familiar with it would not fail to note its depiction of teenage prostitution and love motels. It is important to note that these are just some minor elements which steer the film towards its ultimate destination-an impossible love story between an innocent young man and a whimsical damsel who is away from any kind of distress. There are no dull moments in the film as the narrative has been loosely structured around three different parts. The brilliance of actors is reflected in these parts as equal importance is given to both the unfolding of drama and the development of romance between the leading players. Lastly, nobody can deny that a lot of thought and preparation has gone into the making of this film. However, as it is said that actors are the artists who help a film to be sold far and wide, a brief yet important mention must be made of this film's lead players namely Jun Ji-Hyun and Cha Tae-Hyun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect RomCom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beautiful film, one of my favorites,one of the finest screenplays in modern films, must watch if you are a fan of ROMCOM's, This cleverly scripted comedy covers a lot of territory in its two-hour running time, containing enough material for at least two movies. I can honestly say that I cannot choose a favorite character because both characters have their good and bad qualities that complement each other so well. The romance part of this movie is what really hooked me. I am such a weakling when it comes to unconventional romances because I actually think the more uncommon the romance, the more realistic it is. These two are certainly an eccentric pair but in a way their romance is so natural.Sure it has pretty over-the-top moments, but that is what makes it funny. It is romantic, funny, unusual, and so unconventional that I would definitely say it is a perfect representation of what every film in the romantic-comedy genre should strive for. I would say see it, or, in the words of the sassy girl, "Risk death!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even after 13 years since its release, this movie still isn't getting old. It's really one of my personal favorites, and after re-watching it again today after some time, I have decided to give one of beloved movies a review.My Sassy Girl offers an excellent narrative to complement the astounding acting of the two main leads. This movie isn't like your average Hollywood romcom, in that its a really sweet and touching love story, but it's not overly cheesy and mushy and the like. You really can't help but to fall in love with these characters and the story!It's a story about how fate always seems to make things right in the end. The only thing I'm a bit sad about right now is not being able relive the FIRST time I watched it wherein it truly captivated me and captured my emotions. I remember feeling melancholic and lonely right after the credits started rolling as I realized that this story that I had grown so attached to for the past hour and a half was over. This movie will always have a special place in my heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film thinking it was going to be a boring romance film, instead it turned out to be one of the funniest films I've seen. The jokes were very simple and are the sort of thing you'd see in a children's film, so avoid this film if you don't like slapstick comedy.The film is about a young man called Kyun-Woo who meets a drunk girl on the train, she pukes on a man's head and the man thinks Kyun-Woo is her boyfriend. Kyun-Woo is rather shy and just goes along with it, the girl then proceeds to faint and Kyun-Woo has to take her to a hotel for her to stay the night. Which is just the beginning of an adventure he had no idea he was away to take part in.The film's based on a blog of the events that happened between the blogger and his girlfriend, however later on he admitted that it was all made up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Sassy Girl is an adorable film. The two main characters are quite lovable, especially the male lead. At first, I disliked the woman. I thought she was mean and unreasonable, but that was before I got to know her better - as cheesy as that sounds. Her character development is extraordinary, too.The film is very sweet and happy - and there's nothing wrong with that! I myself am not too huge a fan of rom-coms, especially after the line up of crappy rom-coms after its golden age in the 90s. However, I quite liked this film. It made my day a lot better, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I felt like tearing up in a few scenes of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, beautiful and heart-warming movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Korea have established themselves as brilliant movie makers a long time ago, and "My Sassy Girl" ("Yeopgijeogin Geunyeo") is a clear testimony to that legacy.This is not just another romantic comedy, this is so much more. The way that director Jae-young Kwak manages to incorporate comedy, romance and drama in such a great way is just fantastic.This movie will make you laugh and it will make you cry.The characters in the movie are nicely detailed, with lots of small finesses and quirks. But the characters are only so much without a proper acting force to bring them to life on the screen. And they have really put two great Korean talents together here; Gianna Jun (playing the girl) and Tae-hyun Cha (playing Kyun-woo). These two are not just good at their art, but together on the screen they have great chemistry.There are so many funny and hilarious situations throughout the entire movie, and lots of really nice scenes. But towards the end the movie takes a turn. And not for the worse, mind you. This turn of events and this way of putting all the pieces together was sheer work of genius from the director. And the movie will most like have you in tears in the 'overtime' segment of the movie.Don't even bother watching the American version from 2008. It is stale and effortless in comparison to the original Korean version. (As it usually is when Hollywood cashes in on the Asian successes!) If you haven't already seen this Korean pearl, then you owe it to yourself and your soul-mate to sit down together and watch this movie. It is nothing less than spectacularly beautiful.The movie can be seen again and again.</fullReview>

Even I think we are still lucky that movies like this still EXISTS.This movie is humane. It's message and characters are humane. It has no meaning if the end of the movie is happy or sad - there is joy and pain both in it, because that's exactly how the life is.This is one of those movies that makes you think about it for hours after you have seen it(whether the first or the fifth time). The reason being that it is funny, witty and enthralling while still maintaining the charisma of a great Korean romantic movie.You will undoubtedly hate Gianna Jun for the better half of the film but by the end, she will be one of the most enchanting woman you ever saw. Tae-Hyun Cha plays the role of a diffident sort nice guy but with good acting and sound expressions.The story? Its perfect its the first time u may see lots of people laughing and crying at the same time.You may think these things cannot happen then watch it and experience a new kind of feeling. This is a kinda movie that wont fade from ur memory in a short while rather will have a great effect on you and ur future relationships. This rating is just the beginning of the tale i wanna say .... 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe difficult to understand characters if you are not Koreans.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a Korean who are living in the US. I haven't got a chance to watch this Korean movie in the last 12 years and today I watched this movie.The following is from other review that raise some questions and I want to answer as best as I can. *(review)I didn't think the characters were developed properly. (my answer) - Some Koreans are very blunt and rude. Those rude people may not act that way in front of foreign visitors, but they do among fellow Koreans. The lady characters depicts those typical rude Korean very well in the movie. Of course it is unusual to see those rudeness among female Koreans than male Koreans( very commonly seen in males in fact ) any Koreans would remember one of those rare female version from their memory back in school. It is just like you would remember a typical dorky guy like Napoleon Dynamite character from your school days if you were raised in the US. Kyun-woo, the male character is quite common in Korea in comparison to the female rude character. Probably 1/3 of my classroom in my middle school /high school years were filled with those timid boys, who would have acted stupid just like the guy did in this movie. This guy knew that the lady was beautiful and those typical timid Korean male don't even have guts to claim that she is his girl friend. Only another "rude" and confident alpha male type of Korean male can act properly to claim her as his girl friend in Korea. That why Kyun-woo looked so stupid as if he was just doing acting by the script. He has been meeting this beautiful girl with a doubt in his mind that she wouldn't hang onto this relationship with him the moment she regains her sanity from whatever trauma she was in. *(review) The two leads never have one meaningful conversation or seemed to be based on any degree of reality.(my answer) I can see the point and frustration. True. That's why the movie has a cultural limitation to convey the human emotion. It speaks a different language from those spoken in the Western World. I enjoy Western movie more because most of the time, Korean melodramas are depend on the out-dated sentiments too much to the point of extortion. But this movie has at least an original story. And this is as real as it can get in Korea. I am speaking this as a Korean who were born and raised in Korea before I came to the US at 32. If you read Korean news paper in Korean, you wouldn't believe what happens in Korea everyday. It is a very different society from Western world. The conversation, custom, story is not far-fetched from reality in Korea.</fullReview>

I could relate to the characters, but their story was still fantastical to me. I usually enjoy romantic comedies, but I don't tend to consider them great films. This is a great film. The interactions between the two main characters were just so excellent, and I felt that I could truly understand what they were both experiencing. The only film I can think to compare it to is Annie Hall, but that isn't even a good comparison. I hope that non-Korean speakers can put aside the fact that they have to read subtitles during this, because that fact does not detract from the quality of this film whatsoever. 10/10, thoroughly enjoyed and absolutely recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished the movie and it definitely is a feel-good movie. But, I am at loss to explain the high rating in IMDb as it is like any other good Jennifer Aniston or Sandra Bullock movie ( which means movie is great and you will enjoy it but the rating falls between 6 to 8).The boy in the movie, Gyeon-woo, is a simple fellow with a lot of feminine traits (like he is the one who wants commitment, he is the one who is beaten up, is scared of parents n of bunking classes etc..)and the girl is very hot and sexy but utterly unfeminine!! She gets super drunk and pukes on people, hits the guy in jest and yeah, stands up for "social issues". Gyeon-woo starts to have feelings for her and has a really sweet way of taking care of her. The girl just broke up with her boyfriend and starts to hang out with Gyeon-woo. Gyeon-woo realizes that she is hurt and sad but pretends to be happy in front of him. He wants her to be happy and takes care of her so that her sorrows hurt no more. They spent a lot of time together and most of their scenes are cute and funny and definitely not boring. The movie goes on like a romantic comedy till the last 30 minutes when it becomes super romantic but a bit too melodramatic/ unrealistic. But this is based on real life so maybe such things do happen. My verdict is this is definitely a good watch..especially on a lazy day with your friends/ partner as you will enjoy it but be warned, its not the classic-type that the ratings project it to be...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revolutionary Korean romantic comedy when it first came out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was basically a revolutionary Korean romantic comedy that made the wave and inspired other Asian movies and dramas to come. And made the term yupki popular in Korea. Which is a term to describe a forceful, bizarre and wild girl. This movie was a huge hit in Korea and some parts of other countries as well. In fact when this movie came out I heard a lot of Koreans dig this movie and it was a amazing movie couples can enjoy. Well after I finished watching it, it's a pretty good romantic comedies that show how sometimes opposites attract. The plot revolves around a wussy average guy that ends up being responsible for a drunk girl on a subway and slowly build there relationship after. The thing is the girl he falls for is a very ballsy, tough and sassy girl that is more adventurous than the guy. This is the movie that greatly boosted Cha Tae-Hyun who I am not fond of at all as an actor, don't know but just never liked his presence on screen much. But he fit his role quite well in this one and Jun Ji-Hyun or Gianna Jun who became a very popular actress at that time thanks to this movie. This movie can become pretty ridiculous at times and throw you off because it goes from situations that are possible to fantasy like elements in certain areas. And I am not talking about the imagination sequences. But it doesn't really take away from this movie even if over 2 hours seems a bit too long for a movie like this. And could have been shortened down a bit without taking away from the total package. The first half of this movie is so and so but it picks up a bit more momentum on the second half. Overall this is a comic book style romantic comedy style movie that is enjoyable and a great couple movie.8.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic For Sure!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Hollywood remake before the original, and I find the original way much better. My definition of good romantic movie is simple: it has memorable scenes and we can connect to the leading actor/actress that we really wish that they have a happy ending in the end. I found those in My Sassy Girl. Jun Ji Hyun played really well as the girl, who is moody,sassy and irritating in the first half of the movie and then slowly as the movie began to reveal, we can understand and sympathize her for what she'd done before in the movie. Cha Tae Hyun also played very well as an average Joe, weak and easily bullied guy but in the end we will see that all he do is just gave in to the woman he loves, that he is a kind person with a kind heart that everybody should love. As a comedy movie, My Sassy Girl have some really hilarious moments. Some that made me laughed very hard: when Cha Tae Hyun had his breakfast after got beaten up by the girl, the call in the library, and the games in the subway. However, My Sassy Girl has its dragging moments too such as the runaway soldier scene (they should cut it), the scene where the girl meet the old man under the tree (time travel is not a tone that match this movie). But over all, My Sassy Girl is really a movie to watch and definitely a classic among modern South Korean movies 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>average boy meets super girl in bad circumstances, in short she is a mixture of tyranny abusiveness, intelligence charm, damaged over another boyfriend, cruel, loving...independent, she is a paradox the movie is a paradox, you should hate her for treating the boy so bad, but the boy comes through as a true friend but in love with her despite her horrible personality...i know it sounds weird and i despise females hitting men for no reason (just because he "annoyed her".but this is not a domestic violence drama......believe or not is a romantic funny comedy and it really, really moved me., Korean humor Korean acting.....it is thoroughly funny at times very sad in others , very very romantic, i could talk all day about this movie, it is a sad paradox between reality and movies.....in real life she wouldn't give him the time of the day as she is ridiculously pretty (she was 21 when she made the movie) and he was average looking at best even then.....i told you this was a paradox.....in real life the actress married a Korean banker at the age of 30, in the movie they are both supposed to be 25-26......i give it 10 stars because as a movie fantasy is perfect but i would give it 0 stars for realism.... women (specially in Korea)don't marry below their social status and physical appearance, and that is life in Korea and the rest of the world........beauty is expensive most of the times and a woman as intelligent as that and as pretty as that would 99% of the time for a better looking better socially partner.....the message from this movie is be that man or forget about a 10 woman or a 9..... otherwise enjoy the fantasy of the movie.....as i have said it is an incredible good fantasy.. but it is not real and it is just not a movie where you can say "maybe if" this is real life and this is a movie about love and friendship..... in real life it would never happen...and that saddens me more than anyone can think.but enjoy the movie it is excellent except for some female abuse on an innocent and naive , but loyal guy, i always vote down movies where this happens (men are belittled by women....it is part of the culture now...men are stupid or abusive women are intelligent and perfect...) i decided not to count it on my score..for once.....Th's is the power of the fantasy for me</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can a chance encounter do to change your life ? This movie will show you what can happen.Kyun-woo (Tae Hyun Cha)is an engineering student. One night he sees a girl wobbling on the platform of a train station. She seems dangerously close to the edge, and he feels obliged to move her out of the train's path. The girl then throws up on one of the passenger of the train. The passenger thinks he's her boy friend, and asks him to clean up the mess. He carries her off the train and tries to leave her, but can't and takes her to a love hotel by the station. She's totally incognito, and Kyun woo tries to clean himself up. Next thing he knows, cops are banging on his door and he's taken to the police station. Next day the girl calls him and make all sorts of demands. She then gets drunk, and Kyun woo ends up taking her to the love hotel again.Now why would a guy get so involved with a complete stranger is the mystery and the comical aspect of this movie. He could have just left her at the station, but he gets himself deeper and deeper into the relationship. The movie is so outlandish that it's hard to believe that it's a true story. But as they say, truth is stranger than fiction. In a good way, this movie is one of the funniest movie I've seen from Korea.The two actors does a great job of carrying the story. Their acting chops are really good. The movie is shot beautifully too. All this makes this movie a very entertaining piece to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film that made be Korean film fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie more than any other movie I have seen and i simply feel in love this film the first time i watched it. This is a story about a guy who is a typical guy and cares nothing in this world more than his sleep and always gives preference to actions over reasoning before doing anything. He meets a very dominating girl like his mother who has a very tragic past and starts manipulating him in a very sweet way and makes him his boyfriend. she makes him do things for her that he doesn't want to do and orders her around. He later realizes why she did all that and also realizes that during all these times he had actually started loving her. but you need to watch this movie to understand what it means. the most subtle plot i have ever seen. based on a famous blog written by an anonymous Korean guy, this movie is perfect example of what Korean cinema is capable of. Reached blockbuster state upon its release and remade several times in different countries, there is a reason why this film is winning hearts everywhere. A total masterpiece for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Asian Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Sassy Girl is a classic movie in the sense that it gives the viewer a perspective about a person who is hurting from a previous relationship,experiencing being in-love on the rebound,a person having a difficult time moving forward to another relationship and finally,it teaches the viewer about mystery of love.In summary,this movie gives the viewer a mature understanding of love,being in a relationship and moving forward after a broken relationship. This is the first Korean movie that I saw and I was truly impressed with it. This classic film started my love for great Asian films. The acting was spectacular in the movie. Gianna Jun and Cha Tae-Hyun have great chemistry as the awkward friends-turned-lovers. Added to that, Gianna Jun's performance of the Girl truly cemented her status as Asia's premiere actress which paved the way for embarking a career in Hollywood. Her portrayal truly set the standard of what a great actresses in Asia should be all about. Kwak Jae Young's screenplay and direction were great as well. A must-see for everyone who loves classic love stories.</fullReview>

I've already watched this film more than 8 times.The first time I've watched this film I just wanted to look it a little bit because of my next day exam however it locked me and I had to watched.(And I have failed =( ] In the beginning you could not understand such kind of a girl but you would understand why does she treat like that way.And these parts make the film meaningful. Everything would be understood in the middle and the end part of the film. It includes everything comedy, drama, science fiction, action in short everything that a film needs. I think that this is the best movie I've ever seen and a must for the youths. May be the reason to make me feel like this is the character of the boy. The same problem that I've felt. I think this film reflects me and that's why I'd like it so much. If you would not watch it, you would loose many things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched the movie only recently (2006) and I have liked it very much. It has become one of my favorite movies. The thing that I like about the movie is its interesting story which is humorous as well as touching. Being based on a true story it gives the movie authenticity linking it with real life situations.The characters of the protagonists is very interesting: A very carefree boy who would do anything for his girlfriend (Eng.putting on ladies sandals )but later realizes the responsibility towards himself for her sake. The girl who having lost her love tries to drown herself in drinks and quarrels to forget him. The characters have been portrayed very well by the lead actors and has been ably supported by the supporting cast. To know they were real people is really intriguing and adds to the excitement when watching the film. The film is essentially is a funny romantic movie filled with humorous scenes (Eng. playing games in the train, being buried alive) as well as touching moments (Eng. when the girl cries standing on top of the hill ). Personally the movie is enlightening in some aspects: Inside every hard person there is some soft corner which calls to be explored. Its a nice movie which can be watched by everybody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hits all the right notes at the right time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's one of the sweetest original films in the romantic comedy genre in years I would have to say.The acting is excellent and the story is fresh and hits all the right notes and all the right times.Plot:This movie is based on actual online journal postings of Ho-sik Kim of him and his girlfriend that was turned into the movie. Kyun-woo is a 25 year old college student coming home on a train one evening when he meets a rather drunk girl on the train ride home. After the girl vomits on a passenger, she looks at Kyun-woo whispers 'Honey' and promptly passes out, passengers jump to the conclusion that he is her girlfriend and guilt him into taking care of her. He carries her off the train and to a motel to leave her there, but the next day she calls him on his cell phone and demands to see him, and thus begins their relationship.The film is dotted with small moments of melodrama combined with a great humor. The girl (we never learn her name) is an outgoing, domineering, blunt women (very odd if you know anything about Korean society), but she does really have a good heart in all this. One of the most memorable scenes is where the girl in walking through the park with Kyun-woo and he feet hurt because of her high-heels, she demands they exchange shoes (not her carry hers... he wear hers). The scene is a great laugh for any women that has ever worn a pair of high-heels, watching the girl prance about in sneakers as poor Kyun-woo winces in pain and does the most awkward walk you've ever seen.The ending was just very well put together with a slight twist that yanks on the heartstrings just right, it made me cry just a bit.The acting is amazing, the English subtitling is a bit odd but you could handle it.Overall I give it a 10/10, if you ever get the chance to see this film I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

In this movie, love is really something unexpected. Story: It is different. A boy, named Gyun-woo, who knows nothing to do with his life until he met this girl drunk in the train. His life turns out to be upside down. But sometimes turning your life upside-down makes you straight again. The girl to has a different story to tell. She maybe cunny, tough, and cheerful; however, she is really vulnerable. It is so amazing that the only one who can see her true self clearly is Gyun-woo, a stranger she met in a train... A great story of fate...building a bridge to the one you love.Artists: Great!!! :D:D:D They are so natural...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeopgijeogin is indeed one impressionable movie that have surpassed its genre not only as a madcap, slapstick comedy to that of a memorable romantic drama that is able to encapsulate the earlier, more lighthearted material to build on the character and personality traits of the protaganists. As such, the viewer is able to relate fairly easily and with considerable feel as the story progresses to a more sobering ending. My only complain is that some parts of the movie seemed largely irrelevant, for example the deserter at the fairground that wasted much precious screentime. By and large though, a really touching and romantic movie, coupled with excellent music.On a side note, the director ( Jae-young Kwak ) of the movie appears in a cameo role as a patron at a roadside eatery sitting to the left of the main actor( Tae-hyun Cha ) as the main actress ( Ji-hyun Jun ) runs pass the camera. I spotted this by pure chance as I was watching the dvd of the movie.</fullReview>

It successfully reflects the indecisiveness of young couples in love. Yet, I was disappointed when the show cast them as in their 20s. That is not realistic as the cast look younger! The movie also shows how weird Fate can be... I commend the convincing acting of the pretty lead actress. She certainly looks that part! One can even see the mischieve in her eyes! Wonder if she is like that in real life! This movie has also proved that you do not need many props or computer effects to be a box-office hit. A good, down-to-earth and feasible plot will suffice. This is one show that I guess East Asians can be proud of. Every couple has their own special story. This one is one of those...</fullReview>

Time passes quickly and you will notice it soon becomes romantic setting.The mood changes to more serious, but the movie is shot so beautifully that it is still refreshing. the ending will be touching and so sweet i promise. this is definitely a film to take your girlfriend too see and it won't be boring. bottom line, its sooo funny but has a romantic twist that appealed greatly to me</fullReview>

The time machine plot: That strange old man is Gyeon-woo from the future and you can see him at the subway scene that the couples meet for the first time. this made the little bit seems-too-loose third chapter more meaningful and enjoyable for me. 2. the old framed newspaper article that appears during the scene where Gyeon-woo first checks into the hotel that shows quintuplets. The inn keeper is actually one of the quintuplets and you can find the others throughout the movie-although i have only found 4 ^^;so even though you have seen this movie i think its worth watching again, and those who have not seen this yet, this has all the things - Cute, Romantic, Funny...all in one, plus the lead actress is really cute!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rating: 9.5/10!!! Although I'm a Korean myself, I think this movie is one of the best described comedy that I've ever seen. I mean the funny part of this movie is that when the girl is more powerful than the man I completly think it was funny. Maybe more like a scary or a bossy girl. It has a very good characters, good story and good acting. The thing that they did was very funny. Especially what they do in the subway. The girl is so scary that this is one of the unusual way to be the couple. It will make you laugh and hilarious all the way. It's very entertaining from beginning too the end. The scene music is very funny and up to the standard. But it would've been a comedy all the time. Because the final chapter is like a sad bit and it kind of kills it. So it would have been a comedy all the time. The story is funny and kind of wacky the whole time. And in the final chapter, It totally changes but a great story line for what they've ben through. The music of this movie however, is very good. great to emphasize this movie. But still, It's a great movie to watch to entertain the people. I recommend this movie for those people who is the fan of the film festival or who needs to get cheered up. I actually think it is good enough to do on the film festival (maybe with a English subtitle) and win the awards, but not the best foreign film for the Oscars. This movie is entertaining and it's one of the best Comedy-drama. R</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cute and touching film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You may have heard about the growing trend of Korean art films, filled with intellectual wit and social commentary--this isn't one of them. You might consider it another one of those Hollywood-copy-cat films, which try to beat off Hollywood's imports with domestic productions (after all, it was top at the box office for six weeks in Korea, topping AI, Planet of the Apes, and Jurassic Park 3). But you could never mistake this for a Hollywood film, or ignore its distinct korean-ness. So what is it? Maybe teen-romantic-comedy-melodrama is the best description, but that doesn't really say much either. All in all, you just have to see it to really know.On the comedy side, there are some jokes I found really funny, and other moments were just too weird to laugh at... and the ending is truly moving. This is also one of those rare romances where you can really sympathize for the guy, he's probably more kind-hearted and caring than the girl, although I guess some guys will just find this too unrealistic--I don't. In fact, much of the film will strike you as unrealistic, and I doubt that the director was looking for realism so much as entertainment value and emotion. In all honesty, if you can't stand unrealistic situations in movies, you'd be better off watching a socialist realism documentary. Otherwise, you'll probably love this film which gives a rare and inquisitive look into contemporary Korean college culture which is both playful, celebratory, and delicate.Korea has had quite a few number of films like JSA, which have sparked a large number of purely entertaining and thought-provoking films that take a simple genre and expand it in all kinds of new ways. Yeopgijogin Kunyo might just be the start of a new genre of enjoyable and moving romance-comedy films that will challenge everything that Hollywood has produced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wacky and comical; A different kind of Romantic Comedy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two lead characters are so wacky and comical in every sense. There is no sex involved between two, and a girl controls over a boy. I mean, that beautiful girl actually forces him to do things for her own pleasure. movie is divided by three chapters. The first two chapters are enjoyable, hilarious in some scenes, and most of all,,entertaining all the way. Then, there goes a thirty minute of third chapter which suddenly focuses on a sappy romance and totally ruins everything; it doesnt make any sense, and too pretentious overall. However, you will still like this one, because it is a different kind of romantic story that you have never seen before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perceptive study of contemporary Korean relationships</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MY SASSY GIRL (2001): At the time of its release, this was the number two Korean box-office hit of 2001 (after the much gloomier FRIEND). Clever story of a layabout student who briefly looks after a drunken girl who, at first, seems to represent everything he dislikes in a woman, but who's complicated nature keeps him from simply walking away. Very perceptive study of contemporary relationships, particularly in Korea, and surprisingly balanced in light of the uniquely Korean tendency toward hyper-melodrama.Granted, the first climax will have you bawling, while the second nicely folds the narrative back to the beginning of the film. Long, but extremely rewarding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie after finals when I thought it would have been a great time to relax. Good one. I had a good laugh, but if I were to think back about the movie, erh, I probably might not have given it a grade of like 8 or 9. Although the film starts out quite uniquely, the later stages begin to sink deeper and deeper into cliche-land, that only the die-hard romance-movie-lovers would be totally impervious to realizing that. The romantic sequences that are pretty much widespread and ubiquitous in a lot of Asian teen flicks. The Korean movie Il Mare deserves an 8 or 9 more.Oh well, and there is the trend(intermittent and occassional if not always present) in Asian movies where the main guy is portrayed as a timid and stupid loser and the girl is an extremely vicious(most probably pretty) shrew. So the story goes.... Good cliche!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>incredibly entertaining, incredibly annoying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people here seem to like this film and praise it for its charm. Few have criticized it for the way it portrays an unhealthy boy-girl-relationship. I agree with both parties. It's a beautiful film and I admit I liked it a lot, but it's also a childish film and it's based on a lie and you should be aware of that lie when you watch it.On the one hand, the film IS extremely funny. From beginning to end, over a length of two hours, it never lets you down. The first encounter of Kyun-woo with the girl is a great scene, and virtually all the scenes that follow are equally good. The film is never mediocre and never predictable. The actors are great. In spite of Kyun-woo's stupidity and the girl's cruelty, I couldn't help but like the two -- they're so cute! As a highly original romantic comedy, "My sassy girl" couldn't be more effective. No doubt this is an outstanding achievement of all the people involved in the making of the film.On the other hand, although it is "only a movie", the statement the film makes about dating and relationships could prove fatal for a young and easy to impress audience. It tells you that if you date a girl who treats you like s***, you should1. always do what she tells you, no matter how ridiculous or degrading it may be2. never hit back when she hits you, no matter how hard she may hit you3. Never tell her that you have needs of yourself, never complain and always be very very patientIf you do so, you will be rewarded someday. The girl will appreciate your self-sacrificing behavior and will make you her man and you will live happily ever after... UAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!! --- DON'T believe this! It NEVER happens in real life! NEVER!! I do well understand that Kyun-woo endured all this because he felt responsible for the girl and wanted to heal her sorrow. But how can you heal someone by simply acting as a punching ball for her, or by being her obedient pet? It's a silly fantasy that will never work out in real life. I figure this kind of story appeals to sensitive adolescent boys who feel weak and worthless and dream about a woman who will think of weak, innocent and obedient men as attractive. And of course it appeals to all the girls who like to think of themselves as the center of the universe and mistake a guy's pathetic submission for romantic love.Stop dreaming, boys. If you fall for a selfish, violent girl in real life, you have three options:1. leave her and never see her again2. go to the police and charge her with battery3. put her over your knee and give her what she begs forThen, and only then, do you have a chance of getting happy. NEVER act like that sorry idiot Kyun-woo. The girl will lose all her respect for you and you'll never get happy. I have never been in Korea, but I'm sure this is true for all parts of the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An extraordinarily popular South Korean romantic comedy. I can see why it's popular with audiences, but I really don't get why film buffs hold it up as something special. It's no surprise the film was remade by Hollywood, because it's pretty much a Hollywood rom-com anyway. Tae-hyun Cha stars as a college student who one night meets up with a drunken manic pixie dreamgirl played by Gianna Jun. Now, Jun sure is a beauty, but her character (who is never named) is such an unbelievably obnoxious human being you have to wonder how anyone could stand to spend more than a few hours with her. Really, the nearly nonexistent plot of the film involves sequence after sequence of Jun humiliating Cha and playing awfully cruel love games with him, pretty much your common manic pixie dreamgirl stuff. The plot is annoyingly disconnected, and it's so sexless that for nearly an hour I wasn't at all sure whether the two were even dating. You know, I'm still not sure they were until later in the film, when it's finally confirmed. The film just goes on and on like this seemingly forever. Some sequences are more amusing than others, but it never amounts to much. Then it hits its finale and changes from a quirky romance to full-blown melodrama (which the film summarily and amusingly dismisses earlier), which it in no way earns. It's more than worthy of some eye rolling. It basically gives us the girl's backstory, which there was never any real need to keep from the audience. It feels like it's from another movie, and whatever amusement I might have gotten from their quirky misadventures (which obviously wasn't much as it was) was pretty much spoiled. The final twist is kind of cute, but, spoiler alert, the gal is so unlikeable that I couldn't really give much of a crap whether she got back together with the guy or not. Worst of all, the film runs for two hours and twenty minutes, nearly a full hour longer than any mediocre romantic comedy should.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Skip the director's cut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great romantic comedy that has something to offer for both men and women. While a lot of stuff in this genre from Korea could be described as melodramatic, this movie holds itself in check, even poking fun at the whole thing. Still, it could be considered a bit much for Western standards. Oh yeah, try not to read any synopses for this movie. This movie in particular can very easily be destroyed by spoilers, even light ones. Just watch it.I highly recommend watching the theatrical cut instead of the director's cut. Sometimes, some things should be cut. After seeing both versions, the director's cut includes scenes that really don't add anything, but do disrupt the pacing and overall feel of the movie, in my opinion. Although only 14 minutes longer, the original cut just seems so much more concise, while the director's cut somewhat...muddled. Sometimes less is more, especially when the quality is higher.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Generally, I hate this genre, but this had just enough charm and wackiness to keep me watching. The slapstick and situation comedy are pretty much predictable, but as the saying goes - it's not what you say, but how you say it. In this case - how it's acted.It's interesting that if much of the action were to take place in New York or Toronto, it would be seen to be very hokey, but being in Korea - it works. Of course, it could be the actors; they do a good job of carrying it off.So, ladies - if you must drag your significant other to a "chick flick", this one won't ire him too badly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very entertaining film that swings your emotions around like a bok-choi on a stick. It has some of the funniest scenes I've ever witnessed; it has some of the most heartbreaking moments I've ever seen. It's breezy and light, and then suddenly it's as profound as a philosophy lesson. It's rooted in realism (based on a true story)... but then what's this? suddenly there's an army swarming around a merry-go-round whilst a suicidal soldier causes mayhem under firework-ridden skies. And man there are a few come-outta-left-field gags that I can't mention without spoiling the fun. Let's just say BEWARE OF BLIND DATES! Yeah, as with this movie, you hardly know what to expect. So don't even try. Lay off the bipolar medication for 2 hours and just go along for the ride. It's an amazing experience.One thing I wish someone would clarify though: is vomiting a Korean custom? lol it sure happens a lot in this movie. Funniest thing I've ever seen.I give it 8/10. But I plan on watching it again very soon, and my rating is bound to increase. (This is definitely a see-it-twice kinda movie.)</fullReview>

But I would say they got it totally wrong.Actually most of the stars' behaviors in the movie are overblown. It's for sure that you can't date any men or women if you mimic the star's behaviors or relationships(believe me. I'm Korean and am in my early 20s.

		<shortDescription>Purely wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd like to respond to the writer who asserts, on the strength of having lived in Korea for nine months, that "the girl's aggressive behaviour towards Gyun-Woo is non-existent in [the] patriarchal, male dominated society of South Korea."I haven't set foot in Korea. But I refuse to believe that ANY country is, or ever was, THAT homogenous. The population of South Korea is 48 million; assume that only someone in the heroine's age group could possibly resemble her (she does change in subtle respects as she grows older), and that the chance of any one woman developing her characteristics is a mere one in eight million, then by my rough calculations there's still an even chance that somewhere in South Korea is a woman who resembles her. Most Koreans won't have met her, of course.Never mind whether this story is explicit fantasy or not (I'll need to see the film again before I can become decided on that point); fiction is there to focus on the exceptional, not on the ordinary. "The Girl" is presented as being exceptional. Gyun-Woo is right in thinking that the woman he loves is special and that he won't see her like again. Is everyone else in love right to think this about THEIR beloved also? Maybe, maybe not; other people's love lives aren't part of the story.The fact that The Girl IS as special, as interesting, ultimately as lovable, as the story requires her to be (what's more: actress Ji-hyun Jun is lovely, and her facial expressions have to be seen to be believed) is only one of the reasons that "My Sassy Girl" is as fresh a romantic comedy as you're ever likely to see. Another reason is that it doesn't use romantic comedy formula even as its starting point. The levelling of obstacles standing between the lovers isn't really the point of the story. The point lies in the encounters themselves: how these two people change each other's lives.Each of the three successive acts (first half, second half, overtime) adds something to the story and takes it to a new, unexpected and subtly magical place. Of the many risks Jae-young Kwak took the only one that I think was ill-advised was his decision to make Gyun-Woo's taking the story to Shin Cine studios to be filmed part of the story, suggesting that the movie we're watching is the movie its protagonists helped to create. Luckily we're watching something far better than that and the scene is but a brief distraction, one false note in a two-hour symphony of delight.</fullReview>

If the roles were reversed (say, My Sassy Guy) and it was the man abusing the girl,...well, I'm sure this film would of caused much rage from female viewers.It's an hour too long and and treads over the same ground too much.

		<fullReview>Needless to say, this is "another teen movie", only this time in Korean, not Caucasian actors experimenting with pies and internet web cams fictionally. There is hardly anything splendid or of deeper artistic value about this generic sappy Asian film, which works on a blase formula of tear-jerking and heart-sweetening with overage-underage romance elements. This "loser dates bossy girl" film will definitely attract "bad rap" if it dares to be a "Hollywood" production. Its only merit is that it is anything but Hollywood, as it safely receives patronised "film value" for its hammy adolescent boy fantasy about human relationships on the most elementary level. The girl interprets the essence of "sassiness" wrong, and the boy exploits the SNAG (Sensitive New Age Guy) stereotype to the point of intolerability. There is little room for distinction or uniqueness in this film, which is like many massively produced Asian pop cultural commodities these days, absent of a distinctive "Korean" identity that proudly demarcates itself from the rest of the pack. If one is attracted to the complexities of man-woman relationships, one might as well treat oneself with "Cold Mountain". A must for any teenage or teenage-at-heart boys and girls, a miss for any movie-goers going for a special treat with an lingering aftertaste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disappointing romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Korean romantic comedy which features some of the same type of inanity which can be found in any romantic comedy film. The film is broken into two parts with an added 'overtime' section at the end. The first part features the developing relationship between Gyeon-woo and the beautiful unnamed 'girl'. Gyeon first encounters her completely drunk in the subway and reluctantly saves her. She is suffering from the traumatic breakup of a previous relationship. He is a sensitive guy and through subsequent encounters in the first half of the film, he falls in love and ends up doing anything for her, despite her mistreatment of him. In the second half, things get more complex as the audience discovers some of the reasons for her bizarre and abusive (but in a funny way) behavior. The 'overtime' resolves the film in the romantic comedy tradition. The relationship in the movie mocks and exaggerates the modern Korean love experience. The guy is hapless, sincere and lovestruck. The girl is smart and cruel yet her cruelty can be explained by personal tragedy and is excused by her pursuit of love and her desire to overcome her loss. Gyeon must suffer to prove his love. The resulting physical comedy is on a par with Hollywood (meaning terribly unfunny) but some Korean wackiness and legitimate poignancy salvages this film from total ignominy. Fortunately, the story is not as straight forward and is therefore not quite as conventionally sappy as the Hollywood equivalent. But do not expect this film to be good enough to transcend its shopworn genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disappointing.I had great expectations for this one since I've read and heard about the buzz it made, and since Hollywood was interested enough to make a remake (and consequently spoiling it), I assumed this had to be the cream of the crop of Asian and moreover, Korean cinema. I recently watched the masterpiece "Hongryeon Janghwa", and I expected this one to be on pair or even better. I was way wrong.I blame the extreme silliness, the lack of realism and the absurdity that sometimes showed the plot. It made me feel I was being awkwardly manipulated to make me feel touched and moved by this supposed-to-be tear-jerker. As the movie goes on, you have to increase your suspension of disbelief, to the point that you start to loose interest and empathy for the characters. I think a good and intelligently written drama doesn't have to recall on absurdity to effectively move an audience sentimentally. The male protagonist is just way too fag and soon you will be killing him by yourself, and what better describes the female one is "an alcoholic manipulative crazy bitch" whose only interesting thing is her physical appeal (and I dare anybody to tell me I'm wrong). The jokes aren't particularly funny, and besides two or three moments of good laughs, the comedy is quite tame.It has however, some good sides that saves it of being a total waste (or shall I say bore?): it has some good plot devices, good narration, acceptable acting, you get to know a little about Korea, good direction and camera work? and yes, a happy ending. The best thing (I think), is that this is not another Hollywood crap. This can certainly be refreshing to watch. I believe this movie had some potential to truly revolutionize drama since it has some interesting ideas, but the silliness and plot-holes turned the authenticity into crude manipulation. And I don't like to be manipulated that way.For those who are looking for interesting Korean movies I'd recommend "Hongryeon Janghwa". Now this one is a movie that wants to play seriously. And where "Yeopgijeogin geunyeo" failed, "Hongryeon" prevails.Cheers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains SpoilersI don't understand the overwhelming popularity of this movie. Maybe it's just me, but I found it overly sentimental and unfunny. I felt it to be no more sincere or dramatic than any contemporary American-made romantic comedy and pales in comparison to anything Capra or Cukor did. I find it ridiculous that My Sassy Girl has a rating that is 0.4 points higher than Mr. Deeds Goes to Town and a whole point higher than Born Yesterday.My Sassy Girl had three endings and five climaxes. It's more of a personal preference, but I like movies to have one climax and one ending. This, like the last Lord of the Rings, kept going climax after climax. I like the feeling of closure, and when a resolution has been reached I get real annoyed when the actual finish is an hour away.I didn't think the characters were developed properly. They just seem to act according to the demand of the script. They were ridiculous, cold and illogical in the first half and loving and sweet in the second. The two leads never have one meaningful conversation or seemed to be based on any degree of reality, which is the basis of any romantic film. All we get are generic humans who I could not care less about and action-movie vignettes. I want to know how everyone who loved this movie felt about Say Anything, Before Sunrise/Sunset and A Tale of Winter, movies that have real people falling in unsentimental love. I can't believe any fan of Eric Rohmer's would find this very dramatic or intelligent.My Sassy Girl wasn't funny. The humor of this film was obnoxious. As a general rule, a man wearing high heels is never funny. Or, the eighth time a racquet ball hits a man in the head is equally unfunny. Also, when in the shower, why would any one answer the phone completely naked when there is a girl in the room? This is utterly stupid and illogical. Put on a towel or simply don't answer your phone.I found it maddening that the film revealed that her boyfriend had died in the last 15 minutes of the movie. This is integral to understanding the girl's "character." I felt like I have been betrayed by the movie. To care about a character, I need to something about them. This film gives you nothing except the boy is an idiot and the girl is a jerk until an hour and a half has past.Also, I don't understand why they parted. Was it because the father disapproved? If so, why would the very sassy, very independent and ultimately loving girl care about her father's disapproval? Maybe, it's the Korean culture but, nonetheless, that wasn't explained well. I would like for those who loved the movie to rebut. Maybe it was just the right night for me to hate this movie.</fullReview>
