		<shortDescription>Bad remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Im a big fan of the original Korean version. This Hollywood remake is a total failure.The screenplay is bad. The story is much less convincing than the original. In the original version, the girl is heartbroken, whose fiancé was killed in a tragic accident, and was really sassy. This made her character inner conflicted. On one side, she was a vulnerable, heartbroken girl. She was so beautiful, so sweet, so sad, like a princess lost her prince. On the other side, she was a furious, sassy, horrible lady. She was mad at the God, at the life, and even at herself. According to the typical standard she was not a decent girl. But sometimes&#xff0c; as i said, she was so sweet.In the meantime, her boy, the boy, was confused. He had on idea about the accident. The girl was just a sassy beautiful girl. Himself, was a lazy, yet naive boy. He takes what the life gave him. Hardworking was not in his book. One day a beautiful girl came into his life. He didn't even know what was going on. He didn't even like the girl at first.In the days he was with the girl, he was silently changed by the girl. From a outsider to a hardworking, life-loving boy.The remake, however, gave us a geek who has a glorious future b4 he met the girl. In less than half an hour, they seemed bonded so much because of no reason. and What happened next seems so fake. Too much acting but true feelings.In order to avoid the spoilers, there are few details above about the remake one.The only reason to watch the remake is to know how remarkable the Korean version is and how trash this remake could be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>May Hollywood Burn In Hell For All Eternity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why does Hollywood feel the need to take classic non-American films and rape them until they're deformed beyond all recognition? It must be nice to make millions of dollars by doing nothing more than crapping on various works of art from other countries. I'm apparently in the wrong line of business.First off, Jesse Bradford sounds like a weasel and gives a mediocre performance. Just watch his reaction after Elisha Cuthbert lies to his teacher ? it's terrible. Cuthbert is your typical Hollywood actress under 30 years of age ? very hot, but couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. Watching her try to be "sassy" is incredibly painful because at times her mannerisms are overly accentuated to the point where she looks like she's got a bad case of hemorrhoids. As far as supporting actors go, the guy who played the runaway soldier was dreadful, and the old man near the end was even worse. Ji-hyun Jun's performance in the original was no fluke. South Korea has at least 5 times as much youthful acting talent than the States. That's no exaggeration.This is your typical Hollywood remake that reenacts a dozen or so scenes from the superior original in unimaginative, idiotic ways (ala "The Departed") in an effort to pander to the dim-wittedness and xenophobia of your typical American moviegoer who would rather slit their wrists than read subtitles. This is evident in the dialogue, which is way too cringeworthy for its own good. Every single line is opaque, thoughtless, and overly simplified to the point of sheer stupidity. Here are some direct quotes from the film: 1. "Death, man?death sucks!" 2. "I like you and the last three days have been some of the most interesting (if not painful) of my life. But my brain is hemorrhaging and my career is ruined and I just think it's better if we part ways." 3. "Who would be intrigued by a hot, mysterious, passionate, possibly bipolar, violent, drunken, arrogant, rude woman?" 4. "Whatever she was going through ? it was beyond anything in my experience and beyond my ability to fix. I had no right to judge her. If I chose to stay with her (knowing the risks) all I could do was give her love and respect and see how the story would end." 5. "I'm sorry. He's just a guy my father made me go out with, but every second I was with him I was wishing it was you and that's why I called you tonight ? I couldn't take it anymore. Charlie, I need you." 6. "Hey kid, is this a subway platform or your own piece of drawing paper?" 7. "You know what? I know that you really don't want to hurt me." 8. "Yessss, I'm free and I'm loving it. Train where are you. Wooo hooo. Choo choo."Hollywood translation: "We resent your lack of intelligence, so we are apparently forced to lower the quality of this film by providing superfluous exposition on the part of the characters for the sole purpose of explaining every little thing to you. You are incapable of extracting emotional content from subtle mannerisms, symbolism, or even the slightest bit of indirect communication. Yes, you are a moron, but if we talentless hacks want to make money, we simply need the characters to verbally and plainly explain every little emotion, lest you become completely lost." Am I the only one who realizes just how much Hollywood hates its own fans? At least 90% of their films are devoid of any and all subtlety. This is even worse in the case of remakes, because they must knowingly suck every ounce of intelligence out of the original film. Wake up people. You can cut the patronization with a knife. These movies scream, "You are an imbecile!" And yes, supporting them does make you an imbecile.Oh, but that's not all. If the insipid, moron-proof dialogue weren't bad enough, this movie drops one of the most idiotic psychological twists humanly imaginable. Our two lovebirds decide to take exactly one year off so Cuthbert can heal her wounds, but she shows up 24 hours late because she needed one more arbitrary day for healing. That's beyond ridiculous. Only a Hollywood executive could think of something this mind-numbingly stupid.The only halfway decent moments in this movie use concepts from the original. There's not a shred of well-executed originality to be found in this steaming pile of excrement. The only positives I can think of are a few pretty camerashots. Hence the 2/10 rating. The only comfort I have is that this vile garbage went direct to DVD. A small victory in the neverending battle against the cinematic dark ages that we Americans currently reside in. Cultural naivety, ignorance, repetition, and incredibly low standards seem to be the favored cinematic ideals around here as of late. However, I must say that the original Korean film is still nowhere to be found at your local video store. One might expect a simultaneous DVD release along with the remake. Such is unfortunately not the case.People wonder why I generally hate Hollywood cinema as much as I do, but I ask you ? my dear reader ? how can I not? I don't like to be patronized by a bunch of talentless hacks in corporate suits who insult my intelligence by making a movie like this and actually expecting me to like it. Maybe I'm missing something, because everyone else around me finds comfort in this masochistic, self-hating existence. My fellow Americans may be flamboyant cowboys in terms of foreign policy, but in terms of entertainment they are the equivalent of abused housewives who keep coming back for more. Whether its ignorance or sheer stupidity, they just don't know any better.May Hollywood burn in hell for all eternity. God knows they deserve it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My American Remake Girl</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yann Samuell's version of 'My Sassy Girl' is pretty much 95% a scene by scene copy of the beautiful Korean film. The hackneyed plot really lacks soul. It's not as bad as the trashy Indian version called 'Ugly Aur Pagli'. The friend character in this American version is annoying and one of the many Hollywood clichés including the Hollywood ending. The Americanized rewriting also makes the characters clichéd. For example the sequences of Charlie's and his friends discussion about relationships is something we have witnessed in numerous sitcoms and movies. No marks for creativity. Jesse Bradford tries to make the best of Charlie (despite the poor writing). Charlie comes across as whiny but remains tolerable because Bradford manages to make some of him likable. Elisha Cuthbert has never looked better but she fails to deliver in the comedic scenes. She's better during the more intense moments.I loved Jae-young Kwak's 'Yeopgijeogin Geunyeo' which is one of my favourite romantic movies. So I was curious about this remake more so because I liked Bradford in his other movies and Cuthbert is quite pretty. This movie is no match for the original but it's not absolutely terrible (like the Indian one). Watch Kwak's movie if you haven't seen it yet and then give this one a try if you really want to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My sassy girl is a remake of the Korean movie of the same name. unfortunately it is not as good as the original Korean one and i just didn't like it very much. the original has better acting and this one doesn't outshine the original with it's acting. the girl in this movie doesn't play the part very well and the guy just doesn't do anything for me. if your going to use the (almost) exact same scenes you should at least do better than the one you are remaking.... if you want to see this movie i suggest watching the original with subtitles (which can be found on the internet) in my opinion it's better. feel free to disagree and compare them yourself. see which one you think is best. the original Korean one was made in 2001 and the American one was made in 2008 (to clear up any confusion). sorry if this offends but i fell this remake was a flop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watch the Korean version first. This version will just act as a spoiler. This is Hollywood just taking the short cut. Look at what is huge in other countries and ripping it off. I was fortunate enough to see the Korean version first, if I hadn't this would have lessened the impact.The acting was only OK. A lot of the emotion was zapped out of the story. In the Korean version the Sassy girl was played and presented better. You knew there was something intriguing about the girl. She seemed emotionally hurt. In this version she seemed more psychotic, She just seemed to attack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sadly this was a bad remake. I'm a fan of the original, and this one didn't make to the standards of the original one.The script is so bad adapted, the characters are nothing like in the original and there are so many key points that they skipped that makes this even worse.---SPOILERS-----Some things that i disliked the most:-The annoying friend Why the hell they needed him. Is annoying, disgusting, perverted pig...-The relation with his aunt They only mention her once during the movie, and in the end she is a totally unknown character.-Skipped parts They rushed so much the movie. In half hour, they showed up already what in the other took 2hrs. -No character development Gwyeon-woo was such an interesting character, and naive. The girl was someone that was really hurt and really a sassy girl. But Charlie is just and idiot with stupid parents. There are nothing like in the original. Gwyeon-woo was also kind of lazy, but Charlie was a completely geek. The character of Eliza is more like the original one.-The ending It had a really bad setup. Besides making it very obvious, in the original it was a little shocking if you didn't realize it before (like my brother) but, even then they waited to the last moment to unveil who was the one the aunt was trying to introduce. Instead, in this one, even someone who wasn't paying attention to the movie could guess the ending (leaving in a side the fact that they end up together) -The locales Everything feels kind of cheap and fake. Im not from U.S but i think that the park was Central Park, and it doesn't feel quite comforting and personal as Jeju Island (where i think they went to put the time capsule). Some places and colors used where nice, but overall, everything felt cheap.I keep thinking that they lost their producers or distributors, because at the beginning you can see that this was done by CJ entertainment and not by some American producers.. Is so sad that they released this way..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why they remake it this way??!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watch the Korean version when i was in University, back in 2003-2004. I love this movie. Love it so much that sometimes i smile remember every scene, i think its very moving and romantic. This movie made me cry because its so romantic, and sincere. Last night i just saw the American version. Oh Lord.. that's the first word i said to my self. The acting very poor ! Elisha Cuthbert fail show the real emotion of loosing someone that she love, and almost crazy because of it. She also can't try to act silly, crazy and wickedly sassy as Ji-hyun Jun in Korea movie. She can't even act drunk. And the guy... hmm.. Jesse Bradford, can't see his chemistry too to his character. And whats up with that friend thing.. euuhh... They trying hard to westernize the movie. But i just feel this movie fail to picture the biggest thing it trying to say, about destiny and love it self. You could aside the cultural things, because love it self is universal. This movie i consider fail not because of that culture.. just because poor acting, that's it ! Will vote 2 because at least they still use almost the same script. Its very nice story.. its just too bad... (i am speechless!!) (T.T)Korean/original version is the best ever!! watch it and you will understand what most people here trying to say! (i even watch the sequel!!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fails as both an adaptation or an interpretation of a wonderful romantic comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an American adaptation of the Korean version of the same name. Cuthbert and Bradford both fail to recreate the integral chemistry of the characters from the original version. In comparison to Jun Ji-hyun's portrayal of the "sassy girl", Cuthbert's performance was uninspired and often times painful to watch. Jun Ji-hyun's organic performance of a lively yet complex girl becomes forced and unconvincing in Cuthbert's attempt. One is awkwardly aware throughout the film that Cuthbert is trying to mimic a character rather than becoming the character herself. Besides Bradford's "good boy" image, he contributes nothing to the role. He lacks the emotion and passion of the original character. As for the movie, it is a scene by scene copy of the original version, each more poorly executed than the next. Rather than a cute romantic comedy created by the natural interactions of the characters, this movie feels fake, choppy, and poorly made for budgeted movie. If you're going to watch both versions, make sure you see this one first before the original. To do the opposite would be akin to reading the book and then seeing the adapted movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Trashy American Remake Of A Korean Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Sassy Girl,the 2008 Hollywood version,is a trashy remake of the Korean masterpiece. It was a complete failure and a disappointment.It truly deserves to be a straight-to-DVD release.This movie does not deserve any theatrical release whatsoever.Anyway,the movie stars Elisha Cuthbert and Jesse Bradford.Both stars had zero chemistry.Just like the the original film, this is a story of how a nice guy falls in love with a very pretty girl. The guy is Charlie Bellow, a polite, kind-hearted young man from the Midwestern state of Indiana, and the girl is Jordan Roark, a beautiful, fun-loving, emotionally volatile young woman who drinks too much and lives in New York City with her father, who is a wealthy physician.This is where the characterizations of the movie fails.The Girl from the original film was somebody who was wounded inside while Jordan Roark becomes an alcoholic. While Kyun Woo in the original was an intelligent but someone who lack direction and self-confidence in life whom The Girl falls for due to some mysterious reason,Charlie Bellow becomes a handsome and a nice-guy who simply gets attracted to the opposite in terms of character.The characters in the remake are as shallow as they can get.The movie practically follows the same story of the Korean masterpiece but obviously nobody cares nor empathizes with both Jordan and Charlie.Both looked like a cartoon-like characters instead of human beings in this movie. What's worse,their love story was a complete CHEESE and their adventures have become pure slapstick comedy.According to its director Yann Samuel,"It's a fable about destiny, in the end."But in reality,it was a fable about two idiotic characters that are destined for one another". Skip this one and watch the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh my gosh, I am so disappointed! I absolutely loved the original Korean "My Sassy Girl"! And it absolutely shocks me that it was made by the same person who made "Love Me If You Dare", which was also a great movie! This movie has just completely butchered everything I loved about the original. First of all, in the original, the main female character is a bit sassy and crazy, but she is most definitely not psychotic and out of touch with reality! I don't know what they did to such a lovable character! Throughout the whole American version of this movie, I kept wondering what attracts Charlie to Jordan. I was on his friend's side the whole time.I tried so hard to sit through the movie, but eventually found it impossible. It just made me sick that such an awful remake could be made. It was worse than watching the movie version of my favorite book. Why does Hollywood have to ruin all that is good? I realize that it is difficult to adjust Korean culture in order to fit American culture, and make the story line work, but this just completely failed on every level. The characters were very unlikeable, from the bland and boring Charlie to the Jordan that belongs in a padded room. They just basically took the Korean characters and turned them into awful stereotypes. News to Hollywood: a character doesn't have to be a stereotype for us to relate to them!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a remake, so it's nothing new by default. However, if we pretend that it wasn't a remake, it would still be nothing new. A story about an unlikely couple experiencing trials and tribulations en route to some sort of resolution is not a novel approach to romance.The acting was OK, but not spectacular. Maybe the lead characters did not quite fit the actors or maybe it was something else, but I just did not find them entirely convincing. As a matter of fact, I could not really care less what the final outcome of the story would be and I am the kind of person who watches Christmas Hallmark rom coms.Granted, the movie does have a message, which is why I am not giving it just one out of ten. However, the message is conveyed in a fairly clumsy manner, borderline ridiculous.</fullReview>

No discredit to the actors, they play well enough, but the plot is total crap, and at no point does one feel for the characters! It drags on and on, and this guy he just doesn't get himself together and leave this girl and get a life. Shes completely self absorbed and one feels no compassion for her. I understand why her fiancé killed himself, because she must have been driving him nuts. If you consider seeing this go and watch the notebook or some other movie instead, because this movie will just disappoint you. I mean there is no love in it, they only kiss once and the rest of the time the guy is a pussy and the girl just messes with his head. Sucky!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missed the point, even the non cultural ones.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with the remake is not that it's a remake, but just not a very good film. The film is undecided in the sense that it's not sure whether it should copy the scenes from the original, shot for shot, or whether it should venture into a new interpretation of the original. This indecision, among other reasons, led to its failure. A couple of missed nuances: In the original, the girl specifically asks what Kyun Woo likes on the piano, and he replies Canon, which the girl plays for him. The remake misses this part and the reason why the Girl plays Canon on the piano.The screaming across Central Park doesn't have the same romantic effect as screaming across valleys of mountains.The strikingly similar drinking habits (or intolerance to alcohol) between the girl and her father is absent and so are the multiple jokes, such as the condom incident and "satisfy all your needs" chicks.The list goes on and on. How about the ending, when we're presented with "Aunt Sally?" In the original, there is initial purposeful confusion to make the viewer believe that that is the original girl, aged. However, they miss that beat in the remake. This remake missed the point. It's OK to watch for comparison, but nowhere near the success of a film the original is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible attempt at an adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard Hollywood was working on an adaptation to "My Sassy Girl", I was fairly apprehensive. After all, there were several aspects of the original movie that relied on Asian culture to contribute to the punchline. That said, they deleted many more elements than necessary to adapt this movie to American culture and in the process they cancelled out most of the story's humor and all of its charm. Even though sets were lifted directly from the original, I don't even care to call it an adaptation, because neither of the main characters survived the rewrite; the entire essence is different. Where the girl in the original was fearless, relentless, and mysterious, the adaptation's girl was with restraints and ultimately boring. I'm not sure which is a worse western remake of an Asian movie: My Sassy Girl or One Missed Call. If at all possible, get your hands on the original and just skip this movie altogether.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2 Stars goes for my 2 favorite actor and actress Bradford and Cuthbert. They at least deserve a praise since they have tried their best to portray the characters from the original. It might have been very difficult for them to work to meet the expectations of the fans of the original version.I watch this film (DVD) because I was curious how Hollywood would remake my one of the favorite Korean film "Yeopgijeogin geunyeo" which is the original and the best of all! The other reason is I like Jesse Bradford and Elisha Cuthbert.This remake really sucks! The film might have been good if I haven't seen the original in the first place. I think(in my own opinion)because western culture differ so much with Asians so if you let Americans do the humor of Asians it will not work as fine. Also the delivery of the lines and portrayal of the characters has a different impact when said and portrayed by Asians compared to Americans if the humor is intended to be portrayed by Asians for the Asian culture. But Yeopgijeogin geunyeo however happens to be funny and very good to other nationalities too.Hollywood must've done better or at least match the goodness of the original(which I think they never will) because this film is loved by most people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not My Sassy Girl and not a good romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came to see my Sassy Girl through a round about way. I first watched Ugly Aur Pagli, an Indian adaptation of this film which was mediocre but reminded me to watch the very good Korean film. Then I decided I should watch the American remake.This remake is not My Sassy Girl. I understand that film adaptations can change plot details but it must replace them with something. This removed the one sided ambiguous relationship found in the original and instead substituted Elisha Cuthbert's annoying and not very charming girl for Jun Ji-hyun's portrayal of someone struggling with inner feelings and them manifesting in outwardly through her 'sassy'-ness. The American remake appends a tragedy onto the end but it does very little to actually justify the character's behavior. By trying to Americanism the traits and the relationship it loses a lot--and I don't mean solely because it is American, but because they decide to follow use the trite style of so many American romantic comedies (the roommate, the behavior in their relationship) rather than try to think about a more coherent purpose for the film.It doesn't stand up as a remake because its main purpose is very different from the original but it adds nothing which makes it stand on its own as a good romantic comedy with a deeper story. Even the mediocre Indian remake at least grasped the point of the original story and made it interesting. I had to struggle to finish this film... (okay, I _still_ have a few minutes left).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very disappointed that I wasted 95 minutes to watch the English remake. Though I was very sure that this would be no match to the original one, I was expecting a lot more what the movie offers.Almost all the scenes and even the dialogs seemed so out of place. The storyline just doesn't suit the screenplay. Though the ending was okay, but the rest of it all was just pathetic.I would not recommend people who have already seen the Korean version to watch this movie. If you haven't, then you can probably watch this first, and then move on to the Korean version.The background music also doesn't match the standards set by the original one. Also, the subtle changes to the Piano recital made it even worse. These two versions are just not comparable to each other. The Korean version was one of my all time favorites, the English version is not even worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything about this remake is a mess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the Korean original and sincerely wanted to like this remake. But the two physically attractive stars have absolutely no on-screen chemistry and some poorly thought out script changes make for any number of head-scratching moments. To take just one example, in the Korean version the male lead is a lazy, unmotivated college student who by the end of the movie decides he needs to make something out of his life for the sake of the girl. In the remake, the Jesse Bradford character begins the movie with a promising, albeit boring career ahead of him only to see it all sabotaged by his psychotic girlfriend. At the end of the movie he decides to chuck it all for the sake of the girl. Only a little change, I suppose, but it's the difference between two people that are stronger as a couple than apart, vs two people that always seem to delight in reinforcing each other's self-destructive behavior.I simply couldn't root for these two losers to get together. Please take my advice and skip the putrid remake in favor of the Korean version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amsomnia Reviews - A Freaking Awful Remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am going to try and keep this short this time around, and tell you exactly why you should steer clear of the remake of a far better movie or why you should see it just to know why....HOWEVER if you haven't seen the original movie and are thinking that you should see the remake please don't because all you will see is a very common American flick, that a flick that doesn't have much substance.My Sassy Girl is a remake of the original Korean movie which is named the same. My Sassy Girl from 2001 was an amazing love story weird and sweet at the same time. And you could argue that the original didn't make much sense, that's also why most people saw it more then once. You were meant to look upon it numerous of times to see what the story had to offer, and every time you saw it again more details would be clear to the viewer.It was a massive success in Korea and across the eastern world, it was amazing because it was a love story that wasn't fabricated from someone's mind, it was a love story based on real events.My Sassy Girl from 2008 is Hollywood wanting to get some extra money from a success that they really shouldn't have been able to earn anything from. My Sassy Girl from 2008 didn't have any substance it felt weak and the introduction of a friend to the main character just felt wrong. One of the main issues I had with the movie was the fact that in the end the main characters kiss. I get it but look at the original and see where they went wrong.I don't want to say more, I was trying to get my two cents out, see the original and then maybe see the remake, you will most likely not get the American version while the Korean version should draw you in from the very first minutes. The American version never does this.</fullReview>

This director probably found the original films script translated it to English. Then said hey let's make a romance film! I want the director of this film shot through the head for doing this.GO WATCH THE ORIGINAL FILM!!!!!!Don't even waste your time with this film. Like just about every other reviewer said watch the original before you watch this. This just shows you how far the American Romance genre has fallen.

		<shortDescription>Laugh and Cry, and Be Happy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies, like theatre, have two major categories, comedy and drama but sometimes, like this movie, they are beautifully intertwined. This movie is one of those movies. For the first hour of the movie, I find myself laughing at all the right places, the ones where they wanted me to laugh and where you want to laugh. I enjoy getting to know them and watch their relationship develop. The whole time you know something's off, but you still love watching them together. Then the tears come. The backstory is finally told and you finally understand everything so far. It's beautiful and it's heartbreaking. And I cry. The ending is just wonderful. So appropriate to the movie.The movie feels like real life in all the right ways. Life is not just comedy and it's not just drama. Life is a beautiful mix of the two. There's no telling when the funny parts will be or the serious parts, you just know they come. For me, this make the movie even better. Do you have to suspend disbelief for this movie? A bit. Most guys probably just wouldn't have the patience for a girl like Jordan, and most girls probably wouldn't react and act like Jordan in a similar situation. But that's OK for me. I watch a movie to experience something other than real life. I live a life, sometimes I want a silly girl, the guy that puts up with her, and the love story that they live. This movie is real enough to suspend disbelief where necessary. And it's worth it to allow that to happen. This story is beautiful and worth a watch. My final recommendation for this movie, the point to really take home. I saw this movie on DVD in 2008 or 2009. And, because of series of events, didn't see it again until 2014. This is one of those rare movies that I couldn't forget. It didn't get mixed up with something else. It's unique, and one of my favorite movies. I have seen more movies than I can fathom, some of them I can't remember what they were about (i.e.: The Big Wedding...can't remember it for ANYTHING) this movie, followed me until I finally bought it so I can watch it anytime. I think that's the biggest recommendation I can make for it!Also, this movie has a real independent film feel. When you watch it, you know it's not a mainstream movie, but it offers something that most independent films don't, a happy ending, and I love that about this film. Seriously, just buy it and watch it. It's worth it.Finally, and please understand this, I haven't seen, nor do I intend to see the original Korean version. I'm just not interested. So, I can't compare the two. Matter of fact, I didn't know that it was a remake until long after I saw it. I enjoyed this movie tremendously for it was. I didn't compare it, I just enjoyed it. Maybe it's crap compared to the original, I don't know, i can't say, but this version is wonderful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, let me say that I didn't know this was a remake of a Korean film, so this review will not be a comparison of the two movies, it just discusses the merits of this one.I wanted to like this movie, partly because I really like Jesse Bradford, but mostly because I really love offbeat romantic comedies, and this certainly qualifies as that. I did like this movie, but I didn't love it.I think it gets better in the second half, especially after you find out more about Jordan's character. Before you understand her, she's just a really annoying person, and I couldn't imagine what this kind and gentle young man could possibly see in her.I think this movie works, but it's pretty far along the continuum of offbeat. I wouldn't discourage people from seeing this, but if you've read this far, I'll make a pitch for some offbeat romances that I liked better: Maze (2000) with Rob Morrow and Laura Linney, Dedication (2007) with Billy Crudup and Mandy Moore (don't scoff, she was great in this), Elvis and Anabelle (2007) with Max Minghella and Blake Lively. Check out all 4 of these, if you like romance without the cookie-cutter Hollywood banalities.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I choose to see this movie because I wanted to see something very light after a difficult Friday in the office and it turned to be the worst possible choice I could do.I do understand that productions companies should make films for the 16 years-old audience but that was a disaster. The scenario is non existing, the film making is absent and the actors are playing worse than puppets.If you are older than 16 years then it is better to see commercials than this film. If you are 16 or less then try a nice Disney animation and don't spoil you afternoon or evening with this film.It is really a pity because the "Jeux d'enfants" was a nice movie and I was expecting more from Yann Samuell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It doesn't even belong in the genre, it doesn't give you that warm feeling at the end like most do. Some people say this movie is 'different' and therefore good. There is a reason these type of movies have a common formula, because it works!I don't know if this could be considered a spoiler, but the couple who are apparently 'in love' don't kiss until the last scene. There is no chemistry whatsoever between them, it is not a believable love story and I went through much of the film hating the leading female. She treats the other guy like dirt (again idk if this is considered spoiler material) and by the ended up hoping that he wouldn't end up with her for his sake. I've given 3/10 for a decent ending which still nowhere near compensates for a childish, boring movie. If you have a night in with your other half, steer clear of this, id recommend something along the lines of 'How to lose a guy in ten days' or some such. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breathtakingly Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'My Sassy Girl' is in theory a romantic comedy about a good looking yet slightly eccentric Elisha Cuthbert wooing a good looking yet slightly unworldly Jesse Bradford. It is in fact a cinematic abomination about an idiotic, charmless girl completely implausibly dragging a mind-numbingly boring boy in her wake.The plot is simply flawed, which leaves the ending of the film, which had potential to be a redeeming feature, pointless. The script has few strengths but notable weaknesses, particularly in some terrible attempts at being profound, from such clichéd sources as an old man sitting sketching in a park. The casting is poor at best, apart from the main roles there is the ugly, 'funny' best friend to Jesse, who is far from funny at all. (Though certainly ugly).Whichever Koreans originally wrote this film must be spinning in their graves. They may not have been dead when the film was made, but I imagine they kicked the bucket when watching it. Suffice to say, I don't speak a word of Korean, but I would imagine that I would have enjoyed their original more.An hour and a half of my life I will never get back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All in all, it's an OK movie on its own. Not much different from other cheesy romantic movies, other than the fact that this is a remake of the immensely popular Korean movie of the same name.However, if you compare it to the original one, the pace is much faster and the settings are very different. I find that the American version lacks the charisma of the 2 main characters, and feels very rushed. You don't feel very intimate with them at all, it just feels like another romantic comedy. The funny scenes in the remake aren't as funny as the original; it lacks that pace and originality which made the first one so famous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So the producers of MY BIG FAT Greek WEDDING saw the Korean Version of MY SASSY GIRL and thought it would be a great idea to bring it to the American audience. The American version contained fragments of the original Korean version serving as its core plot line. All the moments that made the original My sassy girl movie memorable were ridiculously and terribly done in the American version. If the producers really wanted to give the American audience the same experience, all they had to do is translate word for word and scene by scene. How can they FAIL so BADLY when the story is already written!? It takes a genius to produce this piece of turd of a remake. The American version completely destroyed what made the original version GREAT.The producers should learn from Quin Tarantino. If you like a foreign movie add subtitle and present it to the American audience. DON'T REMAKE THE DAMN THING!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First I have to say I haven't heard or seen the original version, so I'm not making any comparison to that one. "My Sassy Girl" tells a story of a lonely guy which meets an apparently crazy girl on the subway, and in a strange way they get to know each other. Both main characters are portrayed by two great actors, which makes the movie becomes more involving. One thing that called my attention is that I indeed laughed in many scenes, including the hockey one. That's incredible, given that I hardly laugh in a romantic comedy-- I usually find them dumb. Sadly, after the one hour mark it appeals to the old clichés we're tired of. This is why-- and only why-- I don't give it a higher rating. Good romantic comedy indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I really wanted to like this movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to. I really did. I should start by saying that the original Korean movie "My Sassy Girl" (2001), upon which this movie is based, is one of my favorites of all time. However, everything that I loved about the original has been mutated into something that lacks even a fraction of the charm. And I really did go into this movie trying to hold back any bias that my love of the original may have put on me.Firstly, the two main characters lack chemistry, and the character of the Girl, played here by Elisha Cuthbert, comes of as a completely unlikeable drunk.The extremely short running time (97 minutes) made the movie feel very rushed to me, and much of the story that was subtle or left unsaid in the original is spelled out very plainly in the US version. We're almost beaten over the head so much that the surprise at the end is no longer really that much of a surprise.In a day and age where we can show movies like "Shaolin Soccer" or "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" in US theaters and have them appreciated in their original form, it saddens me that the original "My Sassy Girl" never had this opportunity, instead having to be represented by this shallow, un-funny shadow of its original self.In my opinion, rent this movie only if you absolutely simply cannot stand watching a movie with subtitles. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and hunt down the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even if the movie doesn't start that well, with the acting really unconvincing, it gathers quality in the second part. I think it is quite underrated, maybe 9/10 it's quite generous of me, but I must admit that the park scene is just beautiful. And the way that Elisha Cuthbert is dressed and how well she plays that scene made me more generous to a movie that, being objective, I would rate 7/10. It is a rare movie of Elisha in which she has a really strong role, and it's not a highschool movie, or a horror movie. I think this lady can bring so much more out of her talent. Also Jesse Bradford is not the best choice for this role, but nonetheless the storyline is well written. I must admit I didn't see the originalmovie, but still with the bad U.S.A style of romantic movie, I really liked it, and I would recommend it to anybody who is fascinated by the beautiful face of Elisha Cuthbert and who goes into this types of movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler Warningin the beginning of the movie, "My Sassy Girl" appears to be your basic independent romantic comedy (which is usually told from the male perspective rather than the mainstream faire told from the female perspective). It never saw a huge theatrical release (if any), and it's getting dropped onto the DVD market with little fanfare. The film follows the weird relationship between the straight-laced Charlie Bellow (Jesse Bradford) and the free-spirited Jordan Roark (Elisha Cuthbert). They meet on the subway while Jordan is drunk, and Jesse brings her home to keep her safe. This starts them on the most bizarre courtship imaginable. Jesse wants a normal relationship, but Jordan would rather do things unconventional.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget your former love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Spoilers) So, we have a film about a woman who can't let go of her first love, whom she obviously idealized. She subsequently struggles to accept a new suitor for what he is in his own terms. Instead, she wants him to magically become the old guy. It's more than ironic that so many of the critiques of this film do exactly that?fail to judge it on its own terms. So maybe your former lover really was superior, maybe Jordan's ex was better than Charlie, and, yes, maybe the original Korean version of this film was better than the American remake. I can accept that. But judge this film on its own terms, please. The way the plot unfolds ? without my spoilers ? allows the oddities of its characters to go unexplained until near the end. In retrospect I found Jordan's character and behavior quite plausible. Similarly, Charlie is a bit two-dimensional at first, but then what do you expect from French Lick, Indiana ? an artsy guy like Larry Bird? The guy's ambition is to go into corporate agricultural, after all. There really are people like that. This mysterious girl lures him into something more alive, to use his term. She gains depth in retrospect, once we understand her, and he gains depth because of her. The plot is simply instinctive love exerting a force that carries two young lovers through well-placed doubts and formidable emotional perils. Not terribly original?perhaps even trite, but I liked it. Restrained as I once was by dull ideals, I strongly identified with Charlie's simultaneous resistance and compulsive attraction to this vector- deficient girl who takes over his life. Several times I told him to run fast and far. Yet, although I couldn't understand why, instinct told us to stay. Based on the alleged quality of the original film, this remake of My Sassy Girl probably could have been a masterpiece, but this film is just fine in its own right. I take issue with much of what Hollywood does, including falling short in remakes, bringing every film to a cliché ending, and grossly overstating the presumed wealth of most characters ? none of my physician friends live in anything near the multi-floor Manhattan mansion that the doctor, maybe 15 years out of med school ? inhabits. With all its flaws, however, My Sassy Girl pleasantly filled an evening and made me smile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm rather ill-informed compared to most of the other reviewers. A friend loaned this to me along with 7 other DVDs and I knew absolutely nothing about it or its stars. In fact, with the names Elisha and Jesse, I assumed that Elisha was the male and Jesse was the female. Oops! And I had no idea that this was an Americanization of a highly acclaimed Korean film as I don't believe I have ever watched a Korean film in my life. So my esteemed international colleagues may justifiably think of me as The Ugly American (I am nobody's George Clooney).All that said,I enjoyed this movie immensely. It frequently caught me as off-balance and surprised as the male lead. In some ways, it reminded a bit of Bringing Up Baby and a few earlier '30's screwball comedies with Breakfast at Tiffany's. It also reminded me a bit of The Shape of Things. The pacing was great, the fast-forward photography was well-inserted. This is refreshingly good masochistic fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not the cliché romantic comedy I was expecting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the record, I have not seen the original version of this film. Therefore, my opinion is not biased in comparison to such.It took me a while to get used to this story, as well as the characters. I have seen several movies with a similar character to Charlie - the geeky hopeless romantic who's nice guy routine gives off a total push- over vibe. Of course he has the 'bad influence' friend, who's view of women is more materialistic rather than spiritual (however, the character provides comic relief, no matter how grotesque the humor is...it's 2010, pornography isn't the same blasphemy it used to be thought as). Nevertheless, Charlie's live seemed pretty bland and straight-forward; it was a great setup for the main plot.The moment Jordan is introduced, I knew she was going to be the other main character in this movie. And I have to say, from that moment she began to tick me off. Her personality, drinking habits, and everything that came out of her mouth made me upset, as well as (unfortunately) reminding me of women that I've known who are similar.But that was just me exploring the movie skin deep. About halfway into it, I found myself laughing at Jordan's antics, as well as noticing how much good she was doing for Charlie. She was giving him something extraordinary, that he had never experienced in his life. Have you ever felt like the sky is the limit? Well, with Jordan, I'm sure this was how the character felt. And this is partly why he knew he loved her.The second half of the film brings some unexpected twists, as well as a more dramatic-based dialogue. For anyone who has experienced heartbreak, this will surely push some emotional buttons.The acting in this movie is underrated and overlooked. Especially the contributions of Elisha Cuthbert (Jordan), there is motivation and inner emotion behind every action and every word. I've never been pushed and pulled to such polar opposites by an actor or actress before.This isn't your stock, cliché romantic comedy flick. It provides plenty to ponder over afterward, especially it's great morals and beliefs pertaining to destiny. If you believe in such a phenomenon, you'll only benefit from queuing this up on your Netflix account and witnessing it's artistic perspective.</fullReview>

This movie took a hilariously well thought out yet touching movie and turned it into a piece of garbage. I don't hate remakes but this was way over the border in how much it sucked, The grudge for example i thought the remake was a lot better than the original but this just sucked- again-SUkkED!. I'm not trying to compare this movie with the original or anything but this movie is so lacking to the original movie and story. This one they just take bits and pieces of the story and meshed it all together to get this crap. All the meaning and underlying storyline were lost, such as the frog in the buried capsule and the man visiting from the future- they were really important in the story but that was taken out in the remake.The acting and characters chosen for this movie were horrible. Gotta agree wit people that the girls voice is so annoying and the guys face was totally not suited to the character he was supposed to portray. The guy character from the story is suppose to look kind of dumb and lazy but this guy had looks of more like a sly-slick talking guy instead.-And in response of people of say that the remake is just getting people to be more aware of the original-i say heck no, if i had seen this version first no way i would have went and got the original cause this remake was just like another useless "love-story" movie that was neither inspiring, romantic-nor funny at all. SO more like this movie had turned me away from the original than get me to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite rushed, less effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching the movie. I checked on some of my favorite scenes from the original Korean movie and the remake just didn't best the first one.I just had to watch the movie because I was a fan of the Korean version, even if I thought it was just going to disappoint me, especially after seeing the trailers. Overall it was... okei. It would be more entertaining to those who were not able to watch the Korean version.In some parts though, I hoped that the actors should have done more justice with their roles and did not make the viewer feel that they are just acting instead of making it real to them. After the movie's done, you'll be left with several questions including why they chose that kind of setup in the ending. I really thought they should have not shown that it was Charlie right away, just like in the original setup. Some of the parts of the original movie should have been retained so that the viewers strongly absorb the character that Elisha was portraying. Rushing the evolution of the characters in the movie hindered some scenes to be more moving to the viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never saw the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not seeing the original My Sassy Girl, a Korean film from 2001, I appreciated it more than I probably should've. Once in a while, on a weekday, I'll watch a romantic comedy for the hell of it. I'll usually wind up liking it, but sometimes I don't want to watch something very negative and I'll just turn on something uplifting and positive like this film. There isn't much really to hate on a film like this.Basically, you know the story. Guy meets girl, they fall in love, they break up, they get back together. Movie is over. This one decides to tweak the formula just a bit to try and stand out. Charlie Bellow (Bradford) is a high strung up and coming businessman who just wants one thing; to succeed. One day he is in a subway and finds a girl (Cuthbert), drunk out of her mind, who is about to get struck by a train. He pulls her intoxicated self to safety, and chemistry begins.He takes her back home to his friends apartment where they await her recovery. When she finally does, the relationship from the two is a bit rocky, but soon they become closer and closer. That is when both realize they are beginning to fall for each other. Of course the audience has known that since the beginning.Jesse Bradford was also the guy who played the misogynistic jerk in I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell a year later. It's fun seeing him actually fond of girls. Especially after he played such a simple minded character acting on impulse. It's nice to see him appreciate women. Elisha Cuthbert is also a gorgeous, and wonderful add to the film. Neither her or Bradford do anything wrong and their chemistry is believable.It's not hard to get me to like a romantic comedy. If the story is cute, the characters are believable, the dialog is realistic, and it doesn't seem forced it works for me. In the grand scheme My Sassy Girl doesn't stand out, but it's enough to keep you interested. Still, I will go ahead and assume the original is the one worth seeing.Starring: Jesse Bradford and Elisha Cuthbert. Directed by: Yann Samuell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen the original and thus, will review this movie on its own merits. If I can find any.Where to begin? This is the very classic story of the quiet, slightly stuck up young man who goes to live in the city and meets a beautiful, wild and free-spirited girl. Probably sounds familiar, right? Yes. But that's not what makes this movie awful. This premise works, as many people have experienced this sort of liberating relationship between two very different people. But the treatment here by the writers and directors is beyond redemption.The story is a string of uninspiring clichés that fail to engage you, or even put a smile on your face. Moments that are supposed to provide comedy just make you roll your eyes. The sentimentality and romance is just flat. The chemistry between the two leads is weak at best. Our main characters have very little context to build upon and the same applies to this terrible story.There's no satisfaction whatsoever watching that sort of films, and that comes from someone who loves dramas, comedies and romance.Do yourself a favor. Watch "Forces of Nature", or "Along Came Polly", or even Elisha Cuthbert's own "The Girl Next Door" if you want a similar premise and a better, more heartfelt and funnier movie. There are really dozens of similar flicks and I can't find ONE example that would be nearly as disastrous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a fan of real Korean My Sassy Girl movie, this movie I mean from Hollywood is a trash, over acted, boring dialogue and even story is different from original one which is main reason of super bad remake. The best thing in original Korean movie was the behavior and mood of the girl and her perfect acting and also actor's acting and his mood. I will say directors from Hollywood that you are good in your work but don't do others work again because culture and many other facts make it totally different. Nobody can make "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon" in Hollywood because it is cultural difference and music, sets and every single element of movie reflect a culture which is different in different areas of world. I will give this movie 1 out of 10 and please don't make these rubbish remakes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Sassy girl turned out to be an 'okay' movie although I expected more from it. The way the story went had me rooted but eventually it failed to keep me occupied as there was a lack of emotions and the apparent emotional touch that should be normally present in any romantic movie, was missing. The separation between the two protagonists should have been a little more touching which as a matter of fact didn't happen because of the lame performance from both of them i.e. Elisha Cuthbert as well as Jesse Bradford ( No offense .... but I still think it could have been much better ). I have been told that the actual Korean movie from where this flick was taken was far better than this one as it possessed a lot of emotions plus a great performance by the actors. You would enjoy the movie half way through albeit eventually you would realize that wasn't a damn good reason buddy ! Plus I hate to mention it but the old man spoils the fun in the last moments wherein he deliberately mentions that the letter would bring her down in tears which suggested it to be a pretty good god damn letter, which it wasn't. So that was a party pooper which fell on real hard spoiling the fun altogether. Well although Elisha Cuthbert happens to be one of my favourites (I can't rate her movies just because of that eh !) I would give it a 5 on 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazing how even after years proving you wrong you 'll still judge a movie by it's covers. I was expecting a full-on romantic flick with color but not so much story on any based reality. Hell that isn't the deal! The film is funny -not to the extreme- with lines that balance well with the story and the background. The Jordan-Charlie writing is so good that is hard to tell if Elisha is really fitted for the role or if you just like Jordan! During the middle it makes a little curve which in my opinion is due to the fact that the movie is too short in contrast too the story.It is probably a must see if you are on your 20's.It also a must see if you like Elisha Cuthbert. You gonna like her even more.One last thing that made me watch this movie is the fact that Yann Samuell(Jeux d'enfants(2003))directed it. He obviously has his ways with love stories.7/10</fullReview>

So, for all remake haters: how much people do you think would've heard of this movie in it's original version as long as we know it's a 2001 film and the publicity it had was really weak? The remake it's really good fun, it's a romantic comedy, love story, fairy tale, whatever you wanna name it, it's gooood !!!!I liked this movie because of the story, it's uncommon, it's unpredictable! Honestly, I'm tired of the classic comedy where boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy get's girl back or vice-versa.

		<shortDescription>McCheesy's take on "My Sassy Girl"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A sweet Midwestern guy (Bradford) with his life planned out for himself is wooed, groomed, and ultimately dumped by a complicated, elusive gal (Cuthbert).Another remake by Hollywood that failed to deliver. 'My Sassy Girl' was once a stunning Korean film that is until Hollywood laid its dirty grubby little paws on it and just like every other remake Hollywood has done, it is again not that impressive.Save for a couple of scenes with beautifully shot cinematography and a touchy feely-feely love story between Cuthbert and Bradford, it was so goddamn cheesy, I actually liked the chemistry between them.Well after that, pretty much everything goes downhill. The plot is close to non-existent and the love story, albeit good cheesy fun at times, just drags on and on until it ends.'My Sassy Girl' is a 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting try but very lacking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit when I first heard they were making an American remake of My Sassy Girl my stomach kinda churned. I wasn't sure that Hollywood could recreate the amazing korean film from 2001. Now there's good news and bad news... let's start with the good.I like how they added a bit more playfulness to the movie giving it strange cut-scenes in between the main story. This added to the fun factor of the movie, but some may see it as just a simple waste of time. Using New York as the place setting for this film seemed typical but executed decently. And using one of the most recognizable cities in the world helped users become semi-comfortable. Both leading actors do a decent job, nothing too overly noticeable but decent.Now the bad news, though the actors did a decent acting job.. you could still tell they're acting. When an actor feels his role and becomes the character the more enjoyable a film can be. For example Heath Ledger as The Joker in The Dark Knight, he did an amazing job. I wish the actors did the same, but to be honest it seemed to be stale at times. Overall the movie is 1/2 bad. As a stand alone rom/com it does a pretty decent job. But for the hardcore fans it's really obvious that this movie will just never be as good as the original. It's definitely worth watching once, that way you can develop your own idea on this film. They did an OK job trying to port the movie, a lot of things were lost in translation and unfortunately with that happening it simply makes the movie OK.</fullReview>

I search the movie up on Google and click on IMDb. Then what do I see? I bunch of no good, overstated, unappreciative critics badmouthing a great movie. I thought it was a GREAT movie, it was funny, ingenious, and touching. In response to what the others said about this being worse than the Korean one, WHO CARES? The Korean version is the Korean version! If its so great, then why don't you just go and watch it again? This is an extremely well made movie. Maybe some of the "dumb" dialogues that some of the critics refer to are supposed to happen? These two main characters are the average joe, they don't need to polish their dialogue when they speak. Tell me, do you talk like Shakespeare in everyday life? I think not, and everyday life is exactly what this movie is. This movie made me cry, which has only happened twice in all the hundreds of movies i watched.If you haven't watched awesome movie yet, watching it before you die is a MUST. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually do not like remakes of movies but this one wasn't half as bad as the ones I have seen in the past. I mean look how honest it was and remakes usually don't do that. I mean this remake really had me thinking how does one get over a great love. And yes her way was a little crazy but she also helped him in a way only it takes awhile to realize it.I think they tried to make it as honest as possible for Americans which I love. We like to censored our movies more than other countries but even so not that bad people. I know that us as Americans love movies we don't have to read, but sometimes reading subtitles is truly worth it. This movie was great but the first one was better because it was funnier and it had way more emotion. And I like how in the original the girl had no fear she did what she wanted when she wanted. Especially the train scene that they did not put in the remake. Maybe remake movies would be better if you make them exactly like the first one in our languages.But I love the fact they picked Elisha because she has that whole sweet innocent crazy girl going on like her movie the girl next door. She is really growing as an actress.</fullReview>

It's good thing movie doesn't end up with cliché "love conquers all" but end is interesting and makes sense. Sure the twist is not something you'd expect from M. Night Shyamalan but is well done and when you think about it, rewinding it to scenes and story makes perfect sense.Worth watching even if you are not a fan of genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a die hard fan of Elisha Cuthbert and would watch a movie just because she has some role in it. I would not mind even if it is a two min one (Love Actually types). But it is my habit that I see the IMDb ratings before seeing a movie and avoid anything below six. There were some bad reviews regarding how bad a remake this is, but thank god I was not moved by them. As my luck had it, I happened to see an Indian remake of it a couple of weeks back (Ugli Aur Pagli) about which I had no idea that it was a remake as the Indian directors never openly acknowledge such things. I just wish I would not have seen that. Believe me, the Indian version was so pathetic and it just acted as something that gave the spoilers and simply lacked any feel. Even though the spoilers were already known, I still liked the movie. I am sure the director of the English movie picked up Elisha seeing her role in the girl next door as Jordan's character has traits of Danielle in Girl Next Door which it seems come naturally to Elisha. I would definitely recommend it, and is a nice watch with your girl with you. I really liked the end which was somewhat moving. I just wish that Charlie's letter was a bit lengthy and Jordan didn't start crying after reading just a couple of lines as that moment could have been made more intense. Now after reading so much about the original I will try to get my hands on the Korean version too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: My Sassy Girl</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't really watched the original from start to end, so I can't say for sure how well this version was vis-a-vis the Korean one, which shot Jeon Ji-Hyun to prominence in the starring role. The Hollywood remake however, went straight to DVD, but you know that it's Uniquely Singapore that we give DVD releases a chance on our big screens. That said, I thought this remake wasn't as bad as it was made out to be, what with some screaming blasphemy, and calling it inferior.Truth is, I was entertained from start to end, nevermind if certain scenes seemed implausible. After all, this is a romantic movie, and in the genre, if the man says he's gonna fetch a moon, he jolly well plucks it out from the night sky and delivers it. And if we're talking about implausible romance sequences here, then director Yann Samuell would be the right guy at the helm, after all, he brought us the French movie Love Me If You Dare.Elisha Cuthbert takes over the role immortalized by Jeon Ji-Hyun, as Jordan Roark (whose last name becomes a running joke) the ditzy, crazy and perpetually drunk lass whom Charlie Bellow (Jesse Bradford) falls for in one random night where he saves her from potentially injuring/killing herself at the subway. So begins the abusive person versus the Mr straight- laced all round nice guy in comic routine after comic routine, which for the most parts, weren't exactly funny to begin with. And their outings all stem from her dictating where and what time to meet, in which he dutifully obeys, not knowing what's in it for him.Maybe he's a wuss but I guess it stemmed from his being a romantic and genuinely wanting to do whatever she dictated, for the simple reason that he's smitten. After all, I guess who wouldn't, given her attractiveness, and the extremely strange circumstances, which do get explained, in which she behaves. But while both leads are good looking, they do lack a certain chemistry when with each other, making it look like a very forced meeting of lovebirds, in a very artificial way.That aside, the movie does have its slick ending to thank for in weaving together their respective back stories, though they do detract and distract from the main narrative, and bring some attention to how beautiful those shots were made, in having to integrate seamlessly one scene to the next. And its concept of Destiny, and dealing with it, on one hand felt completely honest with its building of bridges to each other, of having to know it and to work at it, but alas the movie eventually fell back on what it had preached, opting instead to leave it to the stars, and a very quick and coincidental one at that, which you can see coming from miles away.I guess for those who have not seen the original, we might be blown away by the story and revelation, given that Korean romantic movies/weepies do not come only at face value. However, having seen some Korean remakes, I would reckon that those who have seen the original will call this a travesty. The jury's still out however, until I get my hands on its Korean predecessor, and then I'll let you know what I think. That I believe I should be able to do so since this version has intrigued me to give the original another go.Otherwise, this movie's still adequate for a decent romantic date. I did however, feel sorry for actresses who played the 11 Woman of No Consequence - sheesh, what a title!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the original Korean movie back in 2005 and loved every bit of it and i was very excited to see how the remake would compare. This movie was very well thought out, very well written and has one of the best ending for a love story, one that you never want to end.This remake not only brings the magic of the original to western cinema but also updates it with a more believable scenario to the one portrayed in the Original....think of this movie as My Sassy Girl 2.0Even though most events that happen in the original are just blatantly copied in this one, i still loved every bit and i would even say that this film breaths a breath of fresh air into an already amazing story. I loved watching this film as it a good movie and makes it great.After watching My Sassy girl i highly recommend that you take some time to watch the original and experience the story in its first iteration.Here's hoping more foreign movies get the Hollywood remake like this.</fullReview>

A lacklustre effort that fails to generate even a smidgen of the Korea original, 'My Sassy Girl' falls flat on almost every count.It's surprising, actually, given the talent involved. Yann Samuel, who directed the devilishy funny 'Love Me If You Dare', helms the picture, and it stars Jesse Bradford as well as the lovely Elisha Cuthbert. They're all good in their own rights, but somehow the chemistry never quite works.'Love Me If You Dare' had a similar premise, actually, and it's surprising that Samuel never quite finds the right tone here. Neither he nor his actors ever get into a comfortable rhythm.First Maq.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have loved watching a lot of Korean movies (having lived in Korea for three years). When I hear that Hollywood is doing a remake of a Korean movie, I cringe. None of them seem to capture the essence of the original...and they pervert the cultural trappings that the movie brings out.Though, this movie showed me that it's possible! Oy! This movie brought out the beauty of the original...while translating well the cultural trappings that made the Korean movie great. I completely enjoyed this remake. That's all I'll say...watch it for yourself. ^^ &#xc815;&#xb9d0; &#xc7ac;&#xbbf8;&#xc788;&#xc5c8;&#xc5b4;&#xc694;! &#xbcf4;&#xc0c8;&#xc694;! ^^</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>i wasn't a that bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never saw the Korean version of this movie so, I will base my comments solely in this version alone, Frankly, the movie wasn't so bad, as a matter of fact I totally thought it was nice. Im sure the original Korean version will be more better and stuff, mainly because of the music and culture that its represents, but we have to put in mind that they are still different movie sharing only one roots and themes.The direction of the movie was great, they totally show everything what is important, they kinda shown it like a theatre stage play manner and its totally understandable,since the story was lovable, and I couldn't think anyway better than the way they shown, playful and witty.The script was well made, the lines and dialog was superb not poetry but nice, and the story was timeless, And yes, only in New York you can set such location, in order to portrayal that kind of story.The acting. There's no doubt that Elisha Cuthbert is one of the most hottest fine actors today, but sadly, she have done better same with Jesse Bradford. I couldn't believe that they missed suck a good script and film by not acting it well, its was a little in part of acting, Sum it up, I think its worth watching, if you haven't watch the Korean version I think this one is a good movie, Keep you watching and wonders what will the story goes, Its about destiny, love and how its work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An awesome remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was actually surprised that I ended up loving this movie. Despite the many negative comments of the movie being too cliché, how they captured the story was very different. I love how they Hollywood-ized this flick. There was in fact, more sense and emotion into this one, although I must admit that the original actors were better, but some how there was a twist in how they conveyed the movie. It's bubbly, it's smart and perhaps ambitious at times and may have been a bit too cheesy, but nonetheless, the movie was very enjoyable and heartwarming at some parts.It's definitely one of the best remakes I have seen! If you are a fan of chick flicks, I'd definitely recommend this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was absolutely amazing. Elisha Cuthbert is beautiful and a great actor and did well. I am used to seeing her in the TV series 24, but she did a great job playing a different role. Jesse Bradford is also gorgeous and watching him for two hours is extremely satisfying.The other characters were very well chosen and did a great job supplementing the protagonists.The plot was creative and very well executed. The comment before said it was originally a Chinese movie, and that the remake in English was poorly done. I have not seen the Chinese version but I could see how that would effect his opinion. t I have no idea where they got "bad movie" from though.I also cried for about 20 minutes at the end because it was so romantic. its a mix of fun upbeat chick flick with romance. So good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BAD Movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that I love Elisha Cuthbert, but this movie... if it wasn't her I wouldn't finish watching it. However, she didn't do too well in this movie. The bad rewrite of the script, the whole concept was twisted. Characters in this movie have totally different personalities from the original Korean version. And since they changed all the characteristics and personalities, the chemistry isn't there anymore, not to mention a lot of important plots they missed or ignored and shortened, making the movie boring. (Again, I finished watching the whole thing only because Elisha is HOTTTT and I wanna have her baby!!!)BTW, I don't think those are their real voice, i think it's voiced over in studio, and that bothered me a lot when i watched the movie.</fullReview>
