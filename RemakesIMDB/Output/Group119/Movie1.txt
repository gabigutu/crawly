		<shortDescription>Great suspense and some genuine surprises.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Debt is a Nazi hunt/spy thriller all rolled into one and it's nice to see a classic thriller that takes the subject matter seriously and relies on suspense to keep us in its grip. I was at the edge of my seat for most of the time and there's plenty of surprising turns in the story to keep even the most jaded enthralled. Most of todays inept filmmakers rely on blowing stuff up hoping that this will count as suspense. It also is such a breath of fresh air in an appalling year of C -grade superhero movies and obscure comic book adaptations. Hopefully this does well so Hollywood can go back to making well written thrillers and dramas like they used to.Best suspense thriller of 2011 so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Go See This Film...Now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to The Debt because I had seen the trailers ages ago and was instantly telling myself I wanted to see this film. Not to be reminded about one of the ugliest of human stains in world history; not because I wanted to think about images in a WWII documentary I happened to watch unattended at an adult party when I was seven years old and will never forget (but, I try); not because I wanted something to feel bad about.I went because of the reviews, the trailer, and Helen Mirren, and pretty much the entire ensemble of brilliant actors. It was a bit slow starting according to my companion, and some of the initial flashbacks left one a little confused, and then once the story started when the Mossad agents were in Germany to track down and bring the "Surgeon of Birkenau" to trial, I was so glad it was a reminder film. That no one will ever fully understand what drives a nation and group like the Mossad to do what they do. This made me understand a little bit more.This was a very tragic, thoughtful film with the embodiment of the mortal coil and well worth watching and thinking about. Helen Mirren and Jessica Chastain as the young Rachel were so good. Give Mirren another Oscar already. And, the men, including the "Surgeon" who I wanted to kill myself, were all so very good in this. I don't agree the film lagged at the end. In fact, it left you wondering, questioning, the twist was unexpected, and I am glad, despite the lingering tears in my eyes as I write this, that I saw it. My fellow cinematic partner agreed as well. Go see this film. You won't forget it. And, we really shouldn't ever forget it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Burden of Truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Espionage thrillers can be so much fun in both book and movie form. Movies actually have a little advantage for the action scenes. Books clearly have the advantage in details, backstory and character development. What is frustrating as a viewer is when a movie starts strong and then crumbles under the weight of expectation ... sometimes trying to make a bigger splash than necessary. Such is the case with director John Madden's remake of the rarely-seen 2007 Israeli film "HA-HOV".The story is centered around a 1965 mission of a trio of Mossad agents. Mossad is Israel's CIA. These three agents, Rachel (Jessica Chastain), Stephan (Marton Csokas) and David (Sam Worthington) are to capture the notorious Nazi war criminal, the Surgeon of Birkenau (Jesper Christensen), and bring him back for a proper trial of war time atrocities.Flash forward to 1997 and Rachel's daughter has written a book about the daring mission and the three heroes. The older version of the characters are played by Helen Mirren (Rachel), Tom Wilkinson (Stephan) and Ciran Hinds (David). We are treated to flashbacks of the mission and how things took a wrong turn, but ended just fine. Or did they? There seems to be some inconsistencies with the story told and the actual events that have created much strain between Rachel and Stephan, and life-altering changes for the more sensitive David.This is an odd film because the best story parts occur when the younger cast members are carrying out the 1965 mission. It is full of suspense and intrigue. The intensity and believability drops off significantly in the 1997 version, but oddly, the older actors are much more fun to watch on screen ... especially the great Helen Mirren. I am not sure what all of that really means, but for me, it meant the third act of the film was a bit hokey and hard to buy.Director John Madden is known for his fabulous "Shakespeare in Love", but not much else. His films since then have all come up just a bit short of that very high bar he set 13 years ago. Jessica Chastain continues her fantastic 2011 season adding this performance to her more spectacular turns in "Tree of Life" and "The Help". Sam Worthington is known for his role in "Avatar", but his character here is so thinly written, I doubt any actor could have pulled it off. Jesper Christensen seems to usually play the bad guy and he is in full glory here as a Nazi war criminal with no regrets.The first half will keep you on the edge of your seat, but by the end you will have a somewhat empty feeling. What a shame as this one teased us with much hope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A debt of gratitude for an enjoyable movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's always nice when you see a movie trailer that looks pretty good, and then when you see the movie it far exceeds your expectations. The Debt, a remake of a 2007 Israeli movie of the same name, is a suspenseful espionage thriller about a team of Israeli Mossad agents as they attempt to track down "the Surgeon of Birkenau". The movie incorporates flashbacks and flash-forwards in a controllable fashion, with approximately half the movie taking place in 1966 and the other half taking place in 1997. The film is based on a screenplay co-written by Jane Goldman and frequent co-collaborator, Matthew Vaughn, a rising star known for his writing and directing of films such as the underrated Kick -Ass and the 2011 summer hit X-Men: First Class. Director John Madden, best known for his Oscar winning movie Shakespeare in Love, crafts an intriguing film that although predictable at times keeps you engaged. In The Debt, Madden has made some great choices in casting; beginning with Oscar winner Helen Mirren and Oscar nominee Tom Wilkinson, both of whom provide stellar performances. Jessica Chastain, Martin Csokas, and Sam Worthington, although not having any Oscar nominations of their own, give captivating performances during the movie's most brooding scenes. I enjoy espionage films, such as Munich, Spy Game and North by Northwest, immensely. The Debt's strength, much like those other three films, is that it's character and story driven and not dependant on action or special effects to maintain its viewers. The pacing is steady and there's a lot of intensity as the agents attempt to accomplish their mission. The subject matter of the film is a dark one, and that's reflected in the film. Unlike your neighborhood police department or county sheriff's department, intelligence agencies do whatever is necessary to get the result they are seeking; such as some uncomfortable visits, for the patient as well as the viewer, with Dr. Bernhardt, played disturbingly by Jesper Christensen The movie kept me intrigued throughout, and I find myself often sliding up to the edge of my seat, unable to tear my eyes away from what was happening. As the film drew to a close, most questions are answered and closure is provided, unlike just about every other movie made today.Grade: B+visit our site at www.twodudereview.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Debt's potential is spoiled by sloppy writing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is the truth actually what happened or what everyone believes happened? The Debt attempts to answer the question and almost succeeds if it were not for some very poor screen writing. It is 1966 and Mossad has finally tracked down the infamous Birkenau surgeon, Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christensen). Dr. Vogel is very high on the list of Nazi war criminals the Israelis are hunting down because of the atrocities he committed at his concentration camp. He would deliberately blind children to see if he could change eye color and cut off hands and feet and reattach them on the wrong limbs to see what happened.The spy team assigned to kidnap him and bring him to justice are team leader Stephan (Marton Csokas), David (Sam Worthington), and Rachel (Jessica Chastain). Their story is told in flashback and the first half of it is absolutely riveting. Rachel poses as a woman with fertility issues and becomes a patient of Dr. Vogel who is hiding as an OBGYN in the Soviet sector of East Berlin. The tension during the examination room scenes are the highlight of the film with both Rachel and the doctor verbally maneuvering to ensure the other person is who they think they are.After a convincing action sequence, the story abruptly turns from a kidnap/escape scenario into a hostage situation. This is one of the points where the film just falls apart. Mossad and their agents are the best in the entire world at their art. There is no way such highly trained agents would fall victim to and resort to the amateur hour theatrics which come with the hostage sequence. The script is riddled with illogical and bizarre events which only occur during the film's most important sequences for some reason.Fast forward to 1997 and now older Rachel (Helen Mirren) is at her daughter's book release party which describes the team's successful mission to Berlin all those years ago. Older Stephen (Tom Wilkinson) is also around for the recollections. The 1997 scenes are adeptly written and filmed, especially scenes with Mirren. Tom Wilkerson is just along for the ride. Unfortunately, the movie's climax is one of the most preposterous situations a decent film has been saddled with. It is so ridiculous that a two hour meeting with the writers would still not convince me this was the best way to resolve the story's actions and issues. The mood and atmosphere are destroyed and the audience collectively shook their heads in disbelief at the mockery on screen.Screenwriters Matthew Vaughn, Jane Goldman (X-Men: First Class, Kick-Ass), and Peter Straughan (The Men Who Stare at Goats) adapted this screenplay from an earlier film. The Debt's first hour is quite good with adept flow from 1997 to 1966 and the truly suspenseful scenes between Chastain and Christensen. However, their handling of the hostage situation and the absurd climax are what really hurt this film and makes the audience shake their heads with the 'Oh, what might have been' lament.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie that is entirely driven by the plot is refreshing these days. The script is well written and the acting very good. The dialog and interaction between the Dr. form Birkenau and the more troubled of the 3 young agents builds up in great narrative drama. The twists in the plot keep coming. Everything falls into place, even the somber air of the characters at the start of the movie. To me, the movie really starts with the first twist in the story, a good 45 minutes into the film. Your mind has got to reset the sequence. I thought this is getting interesting.Will those who you love the most, prefer your trophies or your truth? Mirren's character choice was clear. I enjoyed this film very much, it does actually make you think. How often does that happen these days?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Drama &amp; Thrill!! Helen Mirren in it (Now you know, your money or time will not be wasted )</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie having an apt title, 'The Debt' doesn't convey the true meaning till the last parts of the movie. A true thriller at the start but soon seems shifts into a dramatic and interpersonal conflict paradigm about what's wrong and right, and the past even though being kept in shrouded mystery and a well-guarded secret does haunt you, forcing you to go back and correct it, once and for all.Helen Mirren does an excellent job (as always) displaying an ubiquitous sense of discomfort and guilt that is present throughout her role. Her interweaving role as a old,retired Mossad-agent with a ghoulish past and a mother who values her daughter's happiness above all. Sam Worthington and Martin Csokas also playing an excellent part on the whole. The film switches from past to present and vice-versa in an excellent manner, maintaining the thrills by not divulging all the information at once about both the time frames. I did particularly enjoy the whole movie experience with action(not exactly adrenaline pumping but still there), emotions and guilt sprayed on the whole 110 minutes. Well, the movie might have got a bit higher on my side of the review for relating to riveting historical events like Auschwitz, which always gets me into the research mode about what and how it happened. But keeping that apart, this is still an awesome movie to watch on a weekend after buying the DVD (completely worth it).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At last, a movie that is as intelligent as it is entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This espionage thriller is an English-language version of a 2007 Israeli film "Ha-Hov" and it is immediately apparent why an adaptation that will inevitably win a much larger audience was made. This is a gripping tale, intelligently told and cleverly constructed. It is much more exiting than the other spy movie of the summer of 2011 "Tinker Tailor Solider Spy" and a much more authentic representation of the Israeli secret service Mossad than "Munich".Essentially we have two stories here, set in different times (1965 and 1997) and different locations (Berlin and Israel/Ukraine) but involving the same characters; yet director John Madden - whose first success was the contrasting "Shakespeare In Love" - has done a skillful job in interweaving the two narratives in a manner which requires the viewer to re-evaluate regularly both situations and motivations. The early period works better than the later one and fortunately it accounts for the majority of the film, but this is almost two hours of sustained tension.Unusually there are seven strong roles in one film. The three Mossad agents Stephan, David and Rachel are played by Marton Csokas, Sam Worthington and Jessica Chastain respectively in the Cold War period and portrayed by Tom Wilkinson, Ciarán Hinds and Helen Mirren respectively in the modern day setting, while the Danish Jesper Christensen is the surgeon of Birkenau throughout the story and gives this profoundly unsympathetic role a subtle psychological dimension.Although most of these roles are male, it is the two female performances that are especially memorable. Mirren has had a brilliant career and it is wonderful to see her at the top of her game in her sixties, while Chastain seems to have suddenly burst into movies with "The Tree Of Live" and clearly has a major career ahead of her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the powerhouse it should have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In John Madden's The Debt, three young strangers in 1965 East Berlin seek to find and capture The Surgeon of Birkenau, a ruthless doctor that performed horrific acts on imprisoned Jews during World War II.The threesome are played by Sam Worthington, Marton Csokas and Jessica Chastain who embody David, Stefan and Rachel respectively in their younger years. Ciarán Hinds, Tom Wilkinson and Helen Mirren play the characters when the film switches between the 1960's to the end of 1999.The film flips between the thirty year time frame liberally in the first third of the film. We watch as the young David, Stefan and Rachel welcome us to 'The Mission' and follow them through the intricate plot details that, if all goes correctly, will bring the doctor to across the Berlin wall to face trial for his actions. Young Rachel will pose as a patient to gain access to the doctor and when confirmation is received, she will use her special training to subdue the surgeon so that Stefan and David can transport him alive to West Berlin and then back to Israel.But things don't go according to plan and soon the three are forced to remain in hiding with their prisoner until they can determine a new course of action. It's while cooped up in their apartment that the doctor begins to use mind games in an effort to gain the psychological advantage while revealing the true evil behind his words.In more modern times, we learn that Rachel and Stefan had both married and divorced. Their daughter has written a book about the abduction and the days that followed in the apartment detailing her parents as heroes to the cause.But recent developments and an unexpected suicide by David leave Stefan and Rachel in the same position they were 30 years ago. And one must travel back to Europe to seek out someone who claims to be the original Surgeon of Birkenau.John Madden is no stranger to award winning dramas. Shakespeare in Love won out over Saving Private Ryan and Ethan Frome was a well received romance back in 1993. Madden works the camera like a maestro in effortlessly weeding the story through multiple decades. The film never loses focus and relies on its strengths ? namely the performances of Mirren, Csokas and Chastain ? to carry the heavy plot line forward.However, in the final acts, the story gets a little lost. Watching Mirren head to Kiev, Ukraine was a leap of faith and political, social and moral values begin to choke the life out of what was a better than average thriller up to that point.With the conclusion of The Debt being too heavy handed to maintain the thin weight of the first ?, The Debt eventually fails to be the film that showed award promise in the trailers. We are not suggesting that The Debt is a bad film, but its final reel wilt does take away from the execution of its predecessors.Mirren may still get award recognition come December (the film is officially released December 29th), but it may be a long shot to see The Debt as one of the Best Picture nominees.www.killerreviews.com</fullReview>

Goes to proof you need a good script.. I'm sure they put a lot of money in this movie, shame.. And the ending.. brrr Overall a movie which really looks like an intriguing film, one that will grab you .. but it just isn't at all. You never get in the story because it is so unconvincing. Compare this movie with the beginning of Inglorious Bastards (genius) or The Reader. OK, I'm comparing with some of the best , but if those films receive 8.5 rating , this one can definitely not be higher then :5.0 (because of the effort) ;)</fullReview>

Huh? There are 3 of them. Do they have a paper route &amp; pizza delivery on the side? Where were the OTHER TWO spending all their time? Were they at the internet café using skype to HQ &amp; watching porn? Effin ridiculous.4. I didn't catch how much time elapsed between Dave punching him out &amp; his escape. But WTF, during all that time, they just left him sitting there with sharp, pointy objects lying all around him. Effin BRILLIANT! 5. oh jeez, the list could go on but ...In a different vein, the fact that they hadn't already killed him after learning that "there is no plan", is a bit of a joke too. Listen, ppl who make a career out of CARRYING GUNS are not so hesitant to kill. Heck, American cops kill innocent Americans constantly.To top it off, the final scene in the bathroom where she just lets an old cadaver beat her up was CLASSIC. I guess they have a gym &amp; a dojo in that hospital to keep the 80 yr old in tip-top fighting shape.Now I cant wait to hear from all the "I believe everything my movies show me" sheeples how this all makes so much sense. Yeah, it makes SENSE to shout out how your plan is effed up &amp; you have no backup plan &amp; all your other problems SO YOUR CAPTIVE CAN HEAR YOU. LMFAO.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a terrible movie with a dreadful and unpleasant story.Helen Mirren didn't need to do this nonsense. She is above this. Jessica Chastain as her younger self acts well but it's such an unpleasant role. How did Sam Worthington turn into Cirian Hinds? Terrible casting. Tom Wilkinson is too English for an Israeli.The fight at the end between Helen and the butcher is absurd both in age ( he must have been 100) and plot.The story is not flattering to both the Mossad or the Germans. It makes a joke of the agents. Stop making holocaust movies based on bad stories like the Reader and this one - there are enough good true stories to base on rather than using this drivel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unfulfilled debt!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best aspect of this movie is the acting, the suspenseful editing and the pacing of the film. Unfortunately it ends there and the most important part of the movie, the storyline and script, suffers.Too much of The Debt seems forced upon the viewer. We are expected to believe and accept the story because that is what is being shown to us. I went in expecting more out of this film and instead I found myself sitting through little more than a forgettable made-for-TV drama.There were a few aspects of this film that spoiled it for me. (SPOILER ALERT!) First and most noticeable, such things as micro-chip high-definition cameras which could fit into a piece of jewelry the size of a thumbnail, did not exist in the 1960's. Without this piece of modern day equipment, apparently our heroes weren't going to be able to prove the existence of 'The Surgeon', so what the hell, give these' 60's spies a piece of technology twenty to thirty years before it even existed.Next, do not be fooled into accepting that a West Berlin train station stop existed between the divided cities and the only thing separating the two sides was a chain link fence and a squad of guards. Also, don't accept that there was a factory with different shifts of workers who were working ten yards from this so called 'highly guarded and secure' border crossing. I lived in West Berlin from 1970-71, the communists went to great lengths years before I ever got there, to clear out kill zones, and construct walls and mine fields between any area that separated the east and west. Any building, like this supposed factory next to the train stop, would have had all the windows and doors cemented over so that it was impossible for any resident of East Berlin to even see into West Berlin. The entire escape sequence in this movie was too far-fetched and left me wondering if this part of the script had been written up as a last minute 'oh what the hell, let's do this?' Clearly someone forgot to do their homework.Why is it that the movie never explains how it is that a doctor can be kidnapped, and a few weeks later he manages to escape, yet no police or agents from East Berlin bother to investigate him or the incident? Wouldn't you think that his wife would have gone to the police? You don't think that the secret police of East Berlin or the KGB would have raised an eyebrow and wanted to find out how this doctor came up missing ? or that he just reappeared? I guess we aren't supposed to ask such questions or try and fill in the missing time line. And don't you think that just once, sometime during the end of WWII, the Russians would have been out looking for this doctor as well ? and yet here he is, operating under their very noses? Don't forget that the Russians hated the Nazis even worse than the Israelis did. But I guess that doesn't come into play in this film.So, we are just supposed accept the fact that somehow this maniac doctor made it back to his wife and practice, and then years later he ends up in a mental hospital thousands of miles away ? for no apparent reason or explanation. Gee ? I'll bite, I've come this far? how much worse can it get? If all of that wasn't hard enough to swallow, oh wait a second, now our hero is going deep into Russia to kill him again, only now it's not really him. But worry not, because he'll just coincidently happened to be walking by in the wing of a mental hospital, and our super spy who has been out of work for years, will see him out of the corner of her eye, chase him down and kill him. Of course she will ? I should have seen this one coming.I'm not that naive to buy this story ? but apparently I was duped enough to go see this movie.If all you are looking for is some decent acting and good suspenseful editing, and you don't care how ridiculous or silly the storyline is, then this is a movie for you. If you want something that gives you a little better of both, pop in The American (starring George Clooney) into the DVD and watch something a little more acceptable.Whoever was responsible for approving this storyline ? did so because they needed to throw 'something' together to pay off a personal debt!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake of the 2007 Israeli film of the same name, John Madden's Westernised take on the gritty espionage thriller is enjoyably diverting, if not much more. Tracking three Mossad agents across two timeframes ? as young adults they embark on a perilous mission to capture a serial killing Nazi surgeon, 30 years later they revisit their haunted memories ? there's plenty going on story-wise. However it lacks that required edge to elevate it into spellbinding territory, largely due to the uninspiring way it's shot and presented. The impressive line-up of actors don't disappoint; Martin Csokas, Sam Worthington and Jessica Chastain gel naturally as the inexperienced spies, whilst Tom Wilkinson, Ciaran Hinds and Helen Mirren add enormous clout as their elderly counterparts. Could've been better, could've been worse; a mixed affair really.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sharp first two-thirds let down by the end of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew almost nothing about this film other than it had some good buzz and Helen Mirren was in it. No idea of the plot, setting, etc., which is rare, so I went in about as blindly as one can.The Debt, in case you are as ill-informed as I, is about a trio of Israeli agents in the mid-60s who infiltrate East Berlin to track down a former Nazi concentration camp doctor and bring him to justice. The team consists of Stephen (the great Marton Csokas), David (Sam Worthington), and Rachel (Jessica Chastain), and they have their own inner tensions ? there's a semi-love triangle, David is overly secretive, and so on. Interspersed with this plot are scenes where the three of them are older (and except for Rachel, look totally different), looking back on the incident, as Rachel's daughter has written a book about it (older Rachel is, of course, Mirren). Sometimes this kind of crosscutting works in a film, but here it is somewhat confusing because older David (Ciaran Hinds) and older Stephen (Tom Wilkinson) look nothing like their younger counterparts, so you have to sort of play 'who's who' for a while until it sorts itself out. Also, they seem to show you the climax of the 60s plot in the beginning, so some of the tension seems to be missing from that thread? until the big twist in the middle of the film, which catapults the action into the modern day. This is where the movie really grinds to a crawl; the older counterparts are so different from their younger versions that it's almost like starting a second movie an hour and ten minutes in. I had a hard time caring about the older characters, and they dominate completely the last third of the film.Mirren of course is good, and Hinds plays older David with a wonderfully haunted mien (he's not in the movie enough to make any deeper impression). All three of the young leads are excellent ?Worthington can sometimes come off as flat, but here he underplays David, and he's excellent (his final scene with Rachel is subtle and exceptional). Chastain, whom I'm not familiar with, is stellar here; we bond with Rachel instantly, and she's an intriguing character. Obviously I like Csokas and he's in his comfort zone here, playing a confident, intelligent prick, but he's magnetic.It's probably because the young leads are so good that the older ones come off so dull and unappealing (even Mirren), and frankly the storyline in the present day (well, the late 90s, their present day) seems trite and silly next to the danger of East Berlin and an ex-Nazi gynecologist. That shift, which may have worked well in a novel (or perhaps in the original Israeli version of the movie), stops the film dead in its tracks, and while we're following the present, flashbacks to the past only drag down the current action more. It's a risky proposition to split a plot between younger and older versions of characters anyway, though it's been done well elsewhere; but here the schism is too jarring, too great to be overcome, and you're left wishing they would have just stayed in the Sixties when the movie was interesting.Overall it's a mediocre film, with some parts very well done and others irritatingly flat. Had the present day plot line been anywhere near as compelling, this would have been a standout film; as it is, it's a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. Some parts are definitely worth a look, but the parts don't add up to a satisfying whole, and with the talent involved, I can't shake the nagging feeling they should have.</fullReview>

Whereas Spielberg makes movies of how we might like to think things might have happened, here we have a movie that depicts events that could well have transpired.Excellent acting, a great story, thought provoking, and it is all joined together to make a movie that leaves you riding every minute.There aren't many movies that comes along like this, and more's the pity that audiences have been conditioned to expect simpler stories with more predictable outcomes. Watch this when you can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A plodding plot, dull dialogue and cardboard characters made this a boring evening. Does Mossad really recruit self-obsessed inadequates from soap operas? The film starts with a confusing series of action sequences posing unanswered questions, which I found irritating. It then proceeds to an over-long and pedantic account of the bungled kidnapping of a Nazi war criminal, who is the standard stock Nazi. At least the same cannot be said of the Mossad agents, who would be more at home in Eastenders - emotional turmoil and histrionics prevail and the situation deteriorates into total catastrophe.However have to say that my wife liked it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Debt owes me back the two hours of my life I spent watching this dumb film. I said this in my review of "The Boy in the Striped Pajamas" and I'll say it again here. When the storyline devolves into crap like this we have reached the point of diminishing returns on screenplays about things related to the Holocaust. The screenplay is full of stupid plot points that have either already been said a million times already or are completely irrelevant to this story. The story spans two generations and manages to say nothing important about either. Usually if I don't care for a film I won't bother to review it. When I really dislike a film I sometimes feel an obligation to review it and warn others. In this case I don't dislike it enough to shred it as it deserves. Just don't bother to see it.

		<shortDescription>Some riveting moments but the casting of principal characters leads to confusion...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot of THE DEBT is rather enigmatic and a bit confusing because of the technique of cutting back and forth between past and present. Added to this is an even more problematic factor: the younger and older counterparts don't look a bit alike, so keeping track of them by character names can keep a viewer in a distracted frame of mind.Other than the script problems, it must be said that the acting is all on a high level, and the story is particularly engaging during the earlier 1967 sequences. This is partly due to the fact that Rachel (Jessica Chastain) gives the most impressive performance in the film and is someone who immediately involves you in the story. She emerges later on into the Helen Mirren image, which is not quite credible in my opinion. Mirren does a fine job as the mature Rachel and her final scenes with the man she has been hunting down is staged realistically with gut-wrenching violence.If you can get beyond the casting problems involved, the story is taut with suspense but told at a rather leisurely pace.Tom Wilkinson and Martin Csokas as old and young Stephan; Ciaran Hinds and Sam Worthington as old and young David; and Jesper Christensen as Dr. Vogel give performances that cannot be praised highly enough. The only drawback is that the resemblance between young and old is entirely missing, a fatal flaw when a film is told in cross-cuts between past and present.Hunting down an ex-Nazi surgeon who has committed war crimes always makes for an interesting story idea...but in this case, there are too many flaws to make the film wholly successful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Edgy Post WW 2 Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people think that this movie is a copy of "Munich" and while it is a revenge movie that is about all there is in common. Helen Mirren's "Rachel" looks back on a time when she and 2 men, all young Israeli Moussad agents, are sent to kidnap and kill an infamous Nazi war criminal. The man is currently working as a doctor. The beginning revolves around the 3 agents, complete strangers living and working together, getting to know each other and infiltrating the Doctors chilly office. The trio become very close as their task at hand becomes more dangerous. After the assignment, the 3 agents are hailed as hero's, but none of them leave without their own scars to bear. Now Rachel, 30 years later, looks to come to terms with what really happened, between her and her 2 co-conspirators, and with the man who everyone believed to be dead all these years. Really excellent performances by all, especially Jesper Christensen who plays the Dr. Every scene in his office leaves you queasy. Very dark and brooding, and a nice little plot twist that was not expected. The very end was the only petite disappointment,to me. Overall a really good, smart film. This is the kind of movie that made Miramax a powerhouse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But first, what great casting. The three main characters are at first in their twenties, then, with different actors, thirty years later but are almost completely credible as older versions of themselves.Jessica Chastain/Helem Mirren is Rachel, one of three Mossad agents who aim to abduct a Nazi war criminal in East Berlin and get him back to Israel for trial and execution. Their way of getting him is plausible and well acted, produced and directed. Alas, things go wrong, they get him but can't get him out of Berlin, then he escapes, nearly kills Rachel and so they conspire to tell their masters that they did kill him. They have to live with the deception until much later Rachel's daughter writes a book all about her wonderful mother. The other two agents David and Stefan have to cope with Rachel who is on her first mission. Relationships develop of course.In my view, Ciaran Hinds as the older version of Stefan, looks more like the younger version of David. But apart from that, it is such a dramatic and gripping movie. I give it a 9.The very different point is that this is a movie about an operation that basically has failed. All along, we are expecting them to succeed just like almost every other spy story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three Mossad operatives - Rachel (Jessica Chastain), David (Sam Worthington) and Stephan (Marton Csokas) - are in 1966 communist Berlin, tasked with extracting Birkenau Nazi doctor/scientist Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christensen) for trial as a war criminal. Things go wrong. In 1997, Rachel's daughter Sarah has just launched a book about the successful outcome of that mission when the past rears its head again, creating upheavals for the three agents 30 years on, now played by Helen Mirren, Ciaran Hinds, and Tom Wilkinson.This thriller, a remake of an Israeli film, is always interesting, and takes a number of twists and turns which aren't always easy to anticipate. The structure - where flashbacks are placed, and how this serves the storytelling - is an intriguing part of the movie. The performances are all good, especially Christensen. The only element which is somewhat lacking is the characterisation, which is not always consistent or clear despite its importance to the story (the relationship dynamics between the three agents are as important in 1997 as in 1966).Incidentally, you are left to fend for yourself in figuring out who "The Debt" of the title is between.</fullReview>

We both enjoyed this thriller of three agents during the '60s trying to bring to trial a Nazi war criminal working as a gynecologist with one of those agents, a woman named Rachel (Jessica Chastain), posing as a patient. The complications that ensue results in another timeline about 30 years later with Helen Mirren now playing the older Rachel and her guilt about certain things she and her fellow agents have had to deal with haunting her. Quite entertaining throughout especially those scenes with Ms. Chastain and that doctor when talking before she...well, watch this movie, The Debt, if you want to find out, and yes, that's a recommendation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of those movies that on the surface is great but one logical question at any point in the film puts it right in the dumpster. The elaborate capture scheme, the blown extraction, the hostage situation while coming up with plan "B" all falls apart when you attempt to find the logic in their actions. Why not grab him off the street once they have solid ID? (Perhaps the evil doc and the missus commuted together? Still, a snatch and grab would still make more sense and be less risky.) Wouldn't you tie him up a little better in the back of the van? I don't think any agent in the world would put that much trust in pharmaceuticals. Hope for the best and plan for the worst. Back at the ranch after their rollicking escape, why agonize over plan B? Shoulda just busted a cap in him in the back of the van and headed for home. Or, if getting him back to Isreal was a that big a priority, but the secondary option falls apart, knock him off in the apartment and... head for home. I couldln't help but think that's what the folks in Tel Aviv would have ordered. (Check our "Munich", Mossad had no problem with "snuff and run" in that story.)</fullReview>

In fact, it is the quality of the film-making that initially fools one into thinking they are seeing a meaningful story. But when the movie ends and you actually reflect upon what you have seen, you find a tepid story not worth telling. Basically this film does for the holocaust what James Cameron's "Titanic" did for one of the greatest maritime disasters in history.

		<shortDescription>A decent movie that deserved a better ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Debt has several things going for it: an interesting story and some fine performances. It's a pity that the ending was disappointing.I'd like to commend Helen Mirren on her performance and even though she gets top billing she's not in it much and when she is her performance doesn't merit the top billing. The stars of the movie are undoubtedly the younger characters played by Jessica Chastain, Sam Worthington and Martin Csokas for it is with them that the events of 1966 are played out and we get a glimpse of what the trio went through during their mission. Jessica was quite excellent, and demonstrates the stress put on a young and inexperienced agent thrust into East Berlin in the 1960s. Marton, as the leader of the trio, was good and his character was never demanding nor bullying in the way some unit leaders can become. Sam Worthington was competent, and perhaps a little subdued, portraying a shy man with more going on inside his head than he wanted the world to see.There is a plot twist, which I won't mention, and which was cleverly disguised in the trailers, which provides turns the story on its head and propels the movie towards the end that I found disappointing. If someone waits more than thirty years to develop a guilty conscience, something that was not properly developed for one of the characters, then it makes it difficult to believe that they would go about with their decision in a split second and undo everything they stood for. It made their first early decision to be quite pointless and in the end more damaging to others than for the main characters. Some would argue that the ending was just fine but in movies that's all well and good but in real life it's not as simple as that. So, I felt a little bit let down for a movie that I was very interested in watching.Is it worth recommending, then? Well, the ending probably won't bother too many people and so it is worth watching as the movie keeps a fine level of tension throughout the movie so you're never to sure which way things are going to go until it occurs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1965, the Mossad agents Rachel (Jessica Chastain), Stephan (Marton Csokas) and David (Sam Worthington) are assigned to kidnap the Nazi Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christensen), a.k.a. The Surgeon of Birkenau, in East Berlin. They succeed in the abduction but fail in bringing him to the west side. While staying with him in an apartment building, Vogel escapes but the trio of young agents lies to their government and tells that Rachel killed Vogel while he was running away. They have been honored in their country by their action for more than thirty years.In 1997, Rachel's daughter Sarah Gold (Romi Aboulafia) releases a book in Tel Aviv about the mission of her mother and the two other agents. Rachel Singer (Helen Mirren), Sarah's father Stephan Gold (Tom Wilkinson), who is paralytic, and David Peretz (Ciarán Hinds), who is missing, are retired and Rachel is uncomfortable with the lie that they have been living with.Out of the blue, David appears in Tel Aviv and commits suicide. Stephan investigates and finds that Dieter Vogel is apparently alive in a hospital in Kiev, Ukraine, and will be interviewed by a journalist. Now Rachel has to travel to Kiev to conclude what they should have done thirty years ago."The Debt" is an engaging espionage thriller with good story and development of characters, great screenplay, acting and direction but a disappointing conclusion. There are flaws, but final redemption of Rachel is unjustifiable for a person that has lived with a lie for more than thirty years and whose decision would not affect only her life, but the lives of her daughter, her former partner and mainly people of her nation who had believed on their words. Sometimes a lie may be useful and that was the case. Her decision will certainly only bring pain and nothing else. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "No Limite da Mentira" ("In the Limit of the Lie")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want a good thriller, you won't be disappointed. That is until the end. Expect your 2 hours to end with a groan. In terms of accuracy, I give this a 1 out of 10. The film portrays the Mossad agents as a bunch of incompetent emotional wrecks. Even the agents on the bottom rung of the worlds spy agencies wouldn't be as awful as these guys - and as is well known, the Mossad is the number one spy agency in the world. I simply cannot understand how anyone could believe that the Mossad screwed up this mission simply because of the emotional screw ups of 2 out of the 3 agents. Spies are cold, calculated, and efficient. Ironically, one of the agents that screwed up is portrayed as exactly so... until the screw-up. Additionally, they couldn't even pronounce the Hebrew names correctly, and in the last scene, Rachel just seems to let herself get stabbed without any attempt at protecting herself. For someone with reflexes and self defense skills as seen in the beginning of the movie, its impossible that she just unlearned that completely. All in all, expect to be entertained, but if you want history or realism, prepare to be disappointed.</fullReview>

Well - Atarot airport was captured by and held by Jordan from 1948 to... 1967 when it was captured by Israel in the 1967 war. you think someone in a big glitzy Hollywood studio mechanism in this star studded, over hyped and overly dramatic film will pick up on such a glaring error but they didn't.

		<fullReview>The Debt tries too much to be an action thriller when it should have focused on being a drama, because there really isn't that much action in the story. On the other hand a drama with a focus on the characters could have given the story more depth. But honestly that is just criticizing the movie for what it isn't. As for what it is is a very decent film that will be entertaining even despite the story's flaws. Out of those the most annoying would probably be the flash forwards that are then later repeated in their entirety even though we've seen them already. It's annoying and adds nothing new to the experience.That and the story doesn't really lead to anything with an ending that seems weird and made up on the last minute. What was Vogel's relationship to the patient claiming to be him and why was he doing it? None of that is explained and the fight at the end seems out of place.That said The Debt is not a bad film, above mediocre I would say, and overall a good watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had expected yet another standard Hollywood take on the Holocaust but this is a surprisingly complicated, or maybe just confused at times, thriller about a botched kidnapping and 30-year conspiracy and its consequences.In a sense the film bites off more than it can chew. So many themes -- revenge, antisemitism, guilt, love, betrayal -- compete for the plot's attention that in the end I'm still not sure which one it decided on. But the process of deliberation was worth it. Even the guilt is so diffracted it's not clear who isn't guilty of something, except for the most guilt-wracked creature in the movie. Even the daughter who vanishes from the scene by the third reel, isn't blameless: you'd think if she'd been a better journalist, she'd figure out who her own father was and that in fact her whole family is full of sh*t.Another implied culprit in the entire kidnap fiasco is the government of Israel, which fails to come through after the initial plan falls through. We don't know why the plan with the Americans falls through, but you know how it is when politicians get involved. All that matters is that the three agents are on their own.Helen Mirren and Tom Wilkinson were the only known actors to me, and it's not surprising that theirs were fine performances. But the whole cast is good.</fullReview>

While the two mentioned films focus on more spy double crosses and mysteries. This is more of a drama revolving around the event and the layers of lies it involved. The acting by the two set of actors (different actors on the two different time lines) is brilliant and you feel touched. It is possible to feel or at least understand the circumstances, the risk and above the uncertainty involved undertaking these missions.The drama does not only show spies as spies but people, something the American's (Show) has able to achieve. It does get slow in parts and predictable in others. If you are looking to see a great spy film, I'd say go for Munich or Tinker, Tailor, Soldier Spy but if you're looking for a drama where the cast of characters happen to be spies this is a good watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really got into this taunt espionage thriller despite some inconsistencies and a beginning that doesn't explain itself very well, jumping around between 1997 and 1965.The acting is fantastic though from Helen Mirren &amp; Jessica Chastain who both play 'Rachel'. Everyone involved is good actually except maybe for Sam Worthington's waffling Aussie accent. It's a very intense story, starting in 1997 with celebrated Mossad agent Rachel learning of the death of a fellow agent. She must then find the truth when a man comes forward claiming to be the Nazi war criminal she supposedly killed 30 years earlier during the mission that made her a legend. The movie follows that 1965 East Berlin assignment, including a vague love triangle and shows how it changed their lives forever.I loved how this movie made me think, what would I do? Would I take the oath? Whatever the case I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have been as compassionate as they were with their prisoner. I sure wouldn't have taken the trouble to force feed him, I'd have kept him weak, blindfolded and kicked him occasionally. That man made me hate! True evil.

		<fullReview>In an age where spy thrillers are rarely made, let alone even being good, this movie brings back some of the old flavor of espionage and still manages to be entertaining. Sure the actual plot behind this movie has been done a thousand times. A trio of former spies are haunted by decisions made in their past, but The Debt changes the formula a bit.The film is told from the viewpoint of the spies when they were younger and also 30 years later. I love when movies or television shows do this. It's fascinating to see actors imitate other actors and I think it's cool to see how different the characters were 30 years apart. Jessica Chastain and Helen Mirren are perfect as the lead. Chastain is one of the best young actresses working today, and Mirren is well one of the best actresses of all time. The lead performances are what carry the movie. The story isn't that interesting, but the script from Matthew Vaughn is spotless.I think the main villain could have been more unique, and perhaps a better actor could have served the role and gave the film more gravitas. The movie is also perhaps a bit too long and somewhat predictable once you get about 40 minutes in. But with the performances from Chastain and Mirren are worth the viewing. I am very much looking forward to Chastain in Interstellar, where she plays the opposite of The Debt, an older version of a character. So in all, this film is solid and shouldn't be glossed over due to the great script and lead performances.+Chastain &amp; Mirren +Spy thriller that is good +Vaughn's script -Seen the story before -Bit Predictable 7.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lives Built on Lies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a movie about three young Israelis who try to capture a notorious Nazi doctor from East Berlin in 1965, with the intent of returning him to Israel for trial. They capture him alright, in a tense sequence, but then after some days he escapes into the night. Now that his war-time identity is known, he'll probably disappear for good.But what are the three Mossad agents to do? The young girl and two men sit around and discuss it. An admission of failure would not only be a disgrace for them but be seen as a humiliating defeat for Israel. So they suffer the spiritual equivalent of a midline granuloma.They agree to lie about it. They claim "the surgeon of Birkenau" was killed trying to escape and his body disposed of. And for the next thirty years they live this lie, writing books about it, accepting awards, giving speeches, and generally playing the role of heroes.The good doctor hasn't quite disappeared, it turns out. He's in a home for the aged in the Ukraine, still full of pee and vinegar, ready with insults and hatred, and still extremely dangerous. The young Mossad agent of 1965 has by now turned into Helen Mirren. She tracks him down and there is a violent climax.This isn't a masterpiece but it's so much more involving than similar Hollywood movies -- "Ransom" and its ilk -- that it's hard to lavish too much praise on it. The relationships between the three Israeli captors and the horrifying ex surgeon (now an OB-GYN) are convincing in their complexity. The conflicts seem real. Who wants to kill a man who appears to be a kindly doctor in late middle age. He has a wife who is worried about him and, for all we know, children who love him. It's only occasionally that cracks appear in the facade and reveal the monster beneath.That monster, though, weakens the impact of the film. It's intense as it is, but it would have been gripping if the old doctor had done a better job of justifying his anti-Semitism or, let's say, having reached a point in his life at which his dislike for Jews was no stronger than the animosity many Americans feel today towards other religions -- Mormonism or Islam, for instance.A nice portrait of genuine conflict, guilt, and enough brutal violence to satisfy those who are interested in it.</fullReview>

As those operations are secretive and undercover, you would never read about the failures; positive outcomes (trials) are often covered by media.The plot covers the events 30 years back and forth and the dilemmas and doubts of the three agents in dealing with a situation that went out of control. The cast is excellent, but I have to admit that Helen Mirren, Tom Wilkinson and Ciaran Hinds outperform Jessica Chastain, Marton Csokas and Sam Worthington, respectively, as their characters of 30 years back. Another great performance is carried out by a Dane Jesper Christensen as a Nazi criminal in the center of all events.The movie is recommended to those fond of intense intelligence stories and admirers of great European (mostly British) actors. The end is spectacular as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Debt-Pays Up ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As always, Helen Mirren shines as an Israeli agent forced to come to grips with a lie that she and others perpetrated some 30 years before. As the younger Mirren, Jessica Chastain, certainly an upcoming actress shows her mettle.These agents were sent in by Israel to apprehend a notice Nazi concentration camp doctor who experimented on the victims. No, we're not talking about Dr. Mengele. Their plan goes terribly awry and the doctor escapes. The three concoct a story that he is dead.Of course, after 30 years, the three find out that the evil doctor is alive in Asia. The effort falls on Mirren to get him.This is a story of trust and ultimate reality with having to tell the truth. There are tragic consequences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Debt is a remake of a 2007 film of the same name from Israel.It's directed by John Madden,screenplay by Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman,Music by Thomas Newman and stars Helen Mirren,Jessica Chastin,Tom Wilkinson,Ciaran Hinds,Sam Worthington,Marton Csokas and Jesper Christensen.Tel-Aviv,1997.Three revered Mossad agents,Rachel Singer(Helen Mirren),Stephan Gold(Tom Wilkinson)and David Peretz(Ciaran Hinds)are the subject of a bestselling biography by Rachel and Stephan's daughter. In 1965 they were ordered to capture Nazi war criminal,Dr.Dieter Vogel(Jesper Christensen)a sadistic surgeon who experimented on concentration camp inmates.They captured him becoming national hero's upon returning home with the news he was killed while trying to escape.However that's far from the truth and thirty years later they must confront their past.With such a plot you think what can go wrong?well unfortunately many things.Firstly the casting of the younger David and Stephan is backwards,Sam Worthington should have played David and Marton Csokas should have played Stephan.Sam looks so much like a young Ciaran it's uncanny and Marton would be more believable as Stephan.Secondly it's hard to imagine that such highly trained agents would be so distracted by each other to properly focus on the mission at hand.All that said though the performances especially Jessica's,Helen's and Jesper's are first rate.There are genuine moments of suspense and many thrills.After a cracking opening forty minutes it sadly all seems to become disjointed and sloppy.If you're looking for a good thriller but don't expect too much this is one to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>" The debt " is about three Mossad agents which live with and suffer from a simple lie for over two decades . They made a slight change in their story when they came back home , which deceived their government and made them popular among people. In 1965 , Mossad agent Rachel Singer arrives in East Berlin to meet with fellow agent David Peretz and Stephen Gold . Their mission is to capture an infamous Nazi war surgeon who experimented unspeakable tests on Jews during WWII and give him what he truly deserves, justice.A skillfully made movie which will catch your eyes and will tell you two different version of one story , a fake one which was made by the agents to deceive the government and was meant to be the key to the agents' freedom , and the real version which could have been a disaster and turned them into criminals who betrayed their country . One of the best scenes in the movie is when they kidnap the notorious surgeon with their considerable plan that seems flawless and with a brilliant teamwork which ends in an outstanding success. This scene wants us to be patient and hold our breath till it finishes. Jessica Chastain as the main role is quite believable and her performance is rather moving.I believe that if the movie stayed just in the past, now we could have a better movie. Although it is good enough to grab our attention I assume that the writers wanted to add a little mystery to their thriller and create a puzzle in our mind, and regardless of what they did, we don't need to rack our brains to grasp the idea of the movie. All in all it's a watch-worthy movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel like there's a really great crime thriller in here, or at least, it could've been great with other creators. That sounds harsh, and maybe it is and I shouldn't diss every film for not hitting the best possible levels or heights. But, it is sort of disappointing, if not really surprising just because the film hasn't had much hype or popularity since it came out until this time. Both Helen Mirren and Jessica Chastain are the clear standouts, with the latter proving to have an insanely crazy and almost impossible year in terms of film and her breakout. Overall, the film is nicely made all around (if maybe a little too pulpy, or not pulpy enough?) and while I don't think it's all that great, still very much worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Debt tells the story of three government agents sent on a mission in the 1960's to capture a Nazi officer, now living his life as a doctor. When their plan goes bad, they conspire to agree to a lie, covering the truth of their past, and each character becomes tormented over the years by the falsehood they have lived and profited from. To complicate matters, the one female and two male agents wind up in a love triangle, which also affects them after they leave their tours of duty. The Debt is more drama than action, with solid acting by all of the actors who represented the three agents, both past and present. All of the characters invoke empathy, with each of them having solid reasons for their very different feelings on what has long been a complicated struggle for forgiveness and redemption.</fullReview>

As Stephan is about to take in David, David deliberately walks in front of a truck and gets killed. There are family secrets and state secrets as the movie tells the story from 1965. Rachel (Jessica Chastain) is on her first mission. Stephan (Marton Csokas) is the leader with David (Sam Worthington) completing the group. Their target is Dr. Bernhardt (Jesper Christensen) who they suspect is the evil Dieter Vogel.I like the spy thriller mystery in this. The biggest and most amazing thing in this movie is Jessica Chastain. She is a revelation. It's definitely a big hurdle to play a younger Helen Mirren. She handles it with no problems. Marton Csokas is compelling but Sam Worthington is very wooden. Jesper Christensen does a very interesting murky performance. All of it is put together in a nice quiet thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read a couple reviews to this film posted here and decided to write one of my own since they were all very controversial. I watched this because spy thriller plus Helen Mirren usually equals something wonderful. I particularly liked the organic acting of both the younger and older character versions. Yes, they are different. Yes, they do not look exactly similar. But who cares, if the actors deliver the message brilliantly. There were mentioning about the change of film dynamics between the parts that depict the past and the present. I think, it is normal, since the characters are not young anymore, they try to live a normal life at a slower pace, the priorities are different. I was pleasantly surprised at the fact that all Russian stuff was correct, the text and the sets looked very much like they were at that time. For some reason, those things are usually screwed up in Hollywood. To add to that, as far as I am concerned (I don't have any exact knowledge on the matter), the Berlin set was wonderful. It is amazing how old aluminum pots and dripping ceiling can add to the atmosphere. While watching this film, I didn't even look at the time since it was full of suspense enhanced by great soundtrack and camera work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This above-average psychological thriller with some tense scenes could rate higher, more like 7.4."The Debt" is a well-written suspense story that hangs together from start to finish. It involves a team of 3 Mossad agents, two men and a young woman sent to East Berlin in 1967 to kidnap a former Nazi doctor who has been identified. The scenes of their plot hold your attention as does what happens afterward.The other part of the story occurs in 1997 when word seems to be getting out in Kiev that the doctor is actually there, when the team has been saying for decades that he was killed trying to escape from his captivity by them.This story is also tense as the female agent, much older and played by Helen Mirren, goes to Kiev.The murderous Nazi doctor, played by Jesper Christensen, has a meaty part as a heavy, adding a good deal of threat, foreboding and physical resistance to the story.Recommended as a solid spy-type suspense story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Debt is a very engaging film that is tense, taut, and just a very good thriller. Released on 2011's Labor Day Weekend, I thought this would be a mediocre thriller that was destined to fail. But it garnished solid reviews and a decent box office. This kind of film goes as far as the actors are willing to go and in my opinion, they all did a very good job.John Madden's film is about how three Mossad agents were tasked on going after an infamous Nazi doctor and how they nearly lost their lives in this mission. Flash forward thirty years, these agents are about to come under fire for their deeds.The acting is very good. People may have complained about the older versions not having the same looks as the younger versions but I really never noticed that. Helen Mirren and Tom Wilkinson are two established actors and they have very credible screen presence. Sam Worthington and Jessica Chastain are also very good as the younger people and Jessica Chastain is a very talented young actress.Overall, this is a solid, well-acted thriller that is actually way better than it should be. My only complaint is that the story often goes back from one time to the other in a heartbeat and sometimes then the story may be a little confusing. But at least it's interesting and well played out. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>English television and film director John Madden's eight feature film which was written by English screenwriters Jane Goldman, Peter Straughan and Matthew Vaughn, is a remake of a film by Israeli director Assaf Bernstein called "Ha-Hov" from 2007. It premiered in the Gala Presentations section at the 35th Toronto International Film Festival in 2010, was shot on location in Hungary, Israel and at Ealing Studios in England and is an USA-UK-Hungary co-production which was produced by producers Matthew Vaughn, Eduardo Rossoff, Eitan Ewan and Kris Thykier. It tells the story about three Mossad agents who are on a covert operation in Berlin in 1965 looking for a Nazi war criminal. Finely and engagingly directed by British filmmaker John Madden, this finely tuned fictional tale which is narrated from multiple viewpoints, draws an intriguing portrayal of a woman named Rachel Singer and her relationship with two men named David Peretz and Stephan Gold. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions and fine cinematography by English cinematographer Ben Davis, this character-driven, narrative-driven and multilingual drama depicts some interesting studies of character and contains a good score by American composer Thomas Newman. This instantly moving story which is set mostly in post-war Berlin, Germany during the late 1960s and in Ukraine during the late 1990s, is impelled and reinforced by it's fragmented narrative structure, interrelated stories and the fine acting performances by Australian actor Sam Worthington, English actress Helen Mirren, American actress Jessica Chastain, Irish actor Ciarán Hinds and New Zealand actor Marton Csokas. An at times riveting and romantic thriller.</fullReview>

This film introduced me to Marton Csokas, as the leader of the trio in Berlin. I was impressed by this character and I think in large part that is due to Csokas. My favorite parts of the film were the scenes set in 1965 with the trio and I would have liked to see more of them once they returned home, however that's just me! The writers did an excellent job.

The girl Rachel was definitely the star though, she did a great job as a young mossad agent and also as an older woman who tries to finish the job and finally reveal the truth. The only unrealistic part of the movie was when fogel tried to fight Rachel in a nursing home. Obviously in that age he wouldn't have had the power to be able to do what he did.

The acting was great, the way the story flowed, while I didn't love it initially, was perfect once the movie unravels, and the plot and character development was superb. It didn't try to overdo it but you felt like you understood the characters ideals and perspectives by the end of the film. Helen Mirren and Sam Worthington do great jobs but Jessica Chastain steals the screen. She's not just gorgeous but she shows the full range in this movie. The movie didn't have anywhere near as much "action" as the previews eluded to but that was both a weakness and a kind of strength of the film so that's not entirely why I knocked the rating down. The main thing I wasn't a fan of was the ending. It felt like the entire film was building to something and then it completely spins in a different direction and that was awesome. However, they didn't seem to finish that direction well and some of the decisions made by Mirren's character in the end seem a bit suspect. Nonetheless, this is a great movie and while everyone certainly won't enjoy it, I think those that can appreciate it will love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Debt is a drama-thriller film directed by John Madden based on a screenplay written by Matthew Vaughn, Jane Goldman and Peter Straughan.A remake of an Israeli film of the same name that was directed by Assaf Bernstein,it stars Helen Mirren, Sam Worthington, Jessica Chastain, Ciarán Hinds, Tom Wilkinson, Marton Csokas and Jesper Christensen.The espionage thriller begins in 1997, as shocking news reaches retired Mossad secret agents Rachel (Helen Mirren) and Stephan (Tom Wilkinson) about their former colleague David (Ciarán Hinds). All three have been venerated for decades by their country because of the mission that they undertook back in 1965, when the trio (portrayed, respectively, by Jessica Chastain, Marton Csokas, and Sam Worthington tracked down Nazi war criminal,Diether Vogel in East Berlin. At great risk, and at considerable personal cost, the team's mission was accomplished - or was it really?At present,Rachel is honored by her daughter Sarah during a release party for Sarah's book based on the account Rachel, Stefan and David gave of the events in 1965. Concurrently, David is escorted from his apartment by an Israeli government agent for a debriefing. David recognizes Stefan waiting in another vehicle and commits suicide by stepping in front of an oncoming truck.At a dinner after their daughter's book release party, Stefan takes Rachel aside to set a meeting to discuss new information Stefan has obtained. Later, at David's apartment, Stefan provides evidence that Vogel now resides at an asylum in Ukraine, and is soon scheduled to be interviewed by a respected journalist.Not everything in the book is quite as it seems. Recent developments in the Ukraine have cast doubt on the now legendary intelligence operation, which would cast the Mossad in the unfortunate light of either not knowing or not admitting what really happened. The Debt is a smart, well-acted entry in a genre but Its time-shifting narrative creates distracting casting problems.Attention to detail is needed to fully appreciate this movie for it works both as a suspense thriller and as a character study.</fullReview>

The story held my attention all the running time. In effect this movie is much shorter than the three hours long Munich. The actors and the director made a very good job here and it deserves all my respect. Believable scenery in eastern Berlin brought me really back to the sixties. All these elements achieve a top rating for a must see. It should have earn at least an Oscar.

		<shortDescription>Considered thriller/drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This thoughtful film commences with three Mossad Israeli intelligence agents returning to their homeland in 1967, as the doors slowly lift on the cargo plane on which they travelled home.They move from the dark to light, a journey that the three continue to travel over the next thirty years.We then move forward to 1997 to meet Rachel played in the present by Helen Mirren, Steven (Tom Wilkinson) and David (Ciaran Hinds) now retired and following differing careers and pursuits. In 1967 as young agents they were tasked to "extradite" or snatch the "Surgeon of Birkenau" or Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christensen). Vogel a notorious Nazi Doktor who used to experiment on inmates within Nazi concentration camps, a fictitious movie creation but presumably heavily modeled upon the real life notorious Auschwitz "Angel of Death", Josef Mengeles.Rachel has a beautiful Daughter and grandchild and enjoys celebrity status for her part in the raid, something her daughter has recently written a book upon.Skipping back in time, we are transported back to cold war Berlin 1967 where the beautiful, inexperienced and much younger Rachel (Jessica Chastain) joins the two Mossad agents "in country", David (Sam Worthington) and Stephan (Marton Szokas). Intending to pose as David's wife Rachel, she not unsurprisingly causes sparks with the young agents with far reaching effects.The film switches between the two basic timelines to great effect and is not hard to follow. This is a revenge film but softened by a desire for justice, the agents are not there to kill Vogel but to bring him home to whatever form of Israeli justice awaits him.Rachel poses as a potential mother wanting assistance from the good Doktor Bernhart, who appears now to be living a life of a paternal obstetrician, complete with a German matronly assistant.It is not long before the Doktor is in the group's care and that is when their problems start, extricating him from Cold War Berlin will not be easy.Mirren, Tom Wilkinson and Hinds all acquit themselves well, as you would expect. Mirren again showing the range of her acting abilities in another excellent characterization. Wilkinson again doing good work for Director John Madden of "Shakespeare in Love" and "Best Exotic Marigold Hotel" fame.The younger actors do well, although Worthington seems a strange choice with his ever present hint of Aussie accent, not a bad role for him but perhaps another actor would have brought more gravitas to the character.To say too much would add spoilers but the plot moves in unexpected directions and adds levels of intrigue, remorse and complicity which transcends a normal "genre" movie. Having great actors in the roles helps of course.Summary A considered thriller/drama that does not provide easy answers and may leave you thinking long after the slightly ambiguous ending.Recommended http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/</fullReview>

I'm not sure if this is based on something (the story would suggest so, but I haven't watched any of the special features nor listen to the audio commentary on the DVD) or not, but it sure is one great story to tell.The thriller has a "time" aspect to it, that will keep your suspense level high.

Jessica Chastain gives a beautiful and passionate performance as the young Rachael as did Helen Mirren as the older version of that same character.The only real complaint that I have with this film is the casting of Ciarán Hinds as the older version of Sam Worthington's character, David Peretz. Don't get me wrong, The acting was good, it's just that I personally thought it would have been better if Ciarán Hinds had been cast as the creepy doctor. Actor Liam Neeson would have been a better choice as the old David.Beyond that, this film was solid. I especially loved the moral dilemma that the main characters had to face. I won't ruin it for you here by going any further into what that means. But trust me when I tell you, this movie is as good as it gets.As far as the mis-casting, well, it's just like what Tom Wilkinson states near the end of the theatrical trailer, "We Have To Deal With It"...And That's All There Is Too It...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I complained in various occasions about the fact that the espionage cinema has been usurped by the action genre, becoming it into a hollow spectacle with more emphasis on stunts and explosions than on the authentic intrigue, paranoia and anguish from the real espionage (at least that is the way in which it is described in books such as Tower of Secrets and The Company We Keep). Fortunately, there are some movies which genuinely belong to the espionage cinema, and even though I did not find The Debt as good as The Lives of Others, Munich or The Quiet American, I liked it pretty much because of its extraordinary performances, interesting screenplay and precise direction.After the commercial Killshot, director John Madden made his return to art-house cinema with The Debt, which I consider his best movie so far. I liked the aplomb shown by Madden in this film, because the minimalistic screenplay did not avoid him from keeping a good rhythm, at the same time he handled very well some tense scenes which balance the intimate narrative.I suppose that many people might think that The Debt is focused on the espionage mechanic...the agents' techniques; the "cat and mouse" game between the Israeli spies and the German police; the betrayals and unexpected turns; etc. But the truth is that The Debt puts the focus on the dynamic between the three main characters, and the gradual psychological collapse which represents living such tense situations. The main characters do not only feel pressure because of working in enemy territory, but also because of their sense of duty and the absolute conviction they have about the fact that their mission means a lot to the Nation's honor. And all those ideologies are multiplied when the story advances in time, and the veteran ex-agents have to deal with the lies and mistakes they made in the past. In other words, it would be more precise to describe The Debt as a movie about spies, and not about espionage...the mission is only the catalyst of the conflict and the detonating of the emotions.And I now have to talk about the magnificent performances from the cast. Helen Mirren, Tom Wilkinson and Ciarán Hinds bring perfect works; and their counterparts from the past do not only show pretty much physical similarities, but also equal histrionic talent. Jessica Chastain does not need too much words in order to wonderfully express the contradictions her character has in the inside, while Sam Worthington and Marton Csokas are also absolutely credible in their roles. The complaints I have against The Debt is that a few parts feel a bit dull, and that the story does not deepen enough into some of its aspects. Nevertheless, The Debt is a very interesting film which deserves a recommendation.</fullReview>

There is a shoot out added. At the end there is the redemption, the white screen of departure from the plane of the three "heroes." Madden takes a drama of real people in extraordinary circumstances and turns it into a morality play about truth. The manipulation's of Vogel in captivity, central to the original are limited in the remake in favor of violent reactions. A key change in the position of dialog is this paraphrase. Jews do not know how to kill, only to die. In the Madden version this occurs while Rachel is shaving Vogel! In the original it occurs in the penultimate scene in the bathroom. The original movie was about the test of wills. The remake was about truth. Madden could have taken the original as a point of departure and made truth the central idea of a good movie. That would have required major changes in the plot. I did see all of the additions, the unhappy marriage with the unfaithful Stefan, the remorse of David, the unrequited love between Rachel and David. For some this might work, for me it is just a distorted remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did enjoy this film, but I can see why it has been slated. The film tells the tale of 3 Nazi contract killers who were praised for a target project, that in truth got away. The plot sees them regroup many years later to locate the evil doctor, and finish the job, before the story leaks.I loved the subject matter (a Nazi war criminal brought to organised vigilante justice) and the cast was on the whole solid, but totally miscast (especially the latter actors when the characters were older). I think a lot of the film's credentials were based upon, and reviewed on Helen Mirren's inclusion, and I do not think this is fair, even if inevitable. The film is well shot, generally well acted, paced and it is entertaining, if you can stick with it.The Debt is a great promise that will disappoint some, but I'm guessing only those really interested d will watch this little almost-gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Really Good Story with an Even Weaker Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A clever intriguing spine-tingling story that leaves the viewer with one big question ? 'And the point is?' This movie, for the most part, had me at the edge of my seat. It was well directed and the acting was super. I was not comfortable with any of the players ? which is a good thing ? added some reality to the characters. I did not see anyone over-kung fooing or flying around skyscrapers or stopping bullets with their bare hands. No superhero stuff in this flick and that is a good thing. The wrap-up or 'lessons learned' was missing. Who was the bad guy ? the Nazi because he killed thousands or the trio of hunters because they lost their prey and lied about it? This is where I was lost. If this was based on some true account ? then I could understand the bland ending ? I mean ? that is real life. But this is not real life or based on any history other than there was a World War II, there were evil Nazis who escaped and there were Jewish agents (Mossad maybe) who chased these guys (and girls) down and brought them to justice. If this was a true story the implied conspiracy would be valid. BUT this movie is about fictional characters carrying out some fairytale job and ends with some weak moral finger-wagging? This was a truly enjoyable thriller that had so much potential until the very end. This is one movie that ends with a big HUH? A note for the team, 'Next time ? pass the very end on to someone else.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"My name is Rachel Singer. In nineteen sixty five, I was part of a mission to kidnap Dieter Vogel, the Surgeon of Birkenau, and bring him to Israel to stand trial. We have always claimed that Vogel was killed trying to escape, but this was lie. A lie I have lived with for thirty years. And now I understand that I must tell the truth." Rachel's (Mirran) daughter has written a book about her mother's triumph thirty years ago. Rachel and her team were assigned to find and kidnap a Nazi war criminal and deliver him to stand trial. When things go wrong the team is forced to come up with a lie, and to keep the truth from coming out. This is a very hard movie to review. While I did enjoy it quite a bit this is not a movie for everyone. The pacing is very deliberate and does tend to drag a little. The mystery and cover-up does keep you watching and interested in how it will turn out. I do recommend this, but it is a movie you have to be in the mood for. Overall, a very good movie that you must be in the mood to watch. Deliberate pacing and intricate details make it a movie that isn't for everyone. I give it a B+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oldest Action Star?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Helen Mirrin has done plenty of good things in her long film career, and the dramatic quality of her acting was on top, brittle form in The Debt. But, in the last part of the film, this very skilled actress also showed that she could still do credible action sequences, well into her 60s.That said, the film was uneven. The direction was first rate, and two of the three younger versions of the main characters - Jessica Chastain as the young Rachel, and Marton Csokas a the young Steven, are both excellent. I found Sam Worthington neither compelling as a character, nor credible as an Israeli. Camera work was technically very good throughout, and at several points one looked at the lovely young Ms Chastain and saw the older Ms Mirrin.You only had two of the characters in their older version for any amount of screen time. And, big a fan as I am of Tom Wilkinson, I think that he was wrong for this role. Like Worthington, I just didn't believe him as an Israeli. Helen Mirrin, as above, was great.The way the story ended was a little hard to take. At one point, Mirrin says to Wilkinson "You are insane" which is about my view of the conclusion. Suspended disbelief is one thing; accepting total improbability in a serious and otherwise realistic scenario is quite another.On a more fundamental note, the theme of the film - the cost of truth and lies, the need to "balance the books" in life, is strong and clear. One can ignore the way the screenwriters needed to tidy things up at the end, and still appreciate the film.One minor point: I think Mirrin was speaking her native Russian, rather than Ukrainian, in the Kiev sequences. That is not totally unrealistic, since the languages are very close, and lots of Ukrainians speak Russian, but for a spy, one never wants to call attention to yourself, so speaking the most common language allows low visibility.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Debt Released: 2011 Cast: Helen Mirren, Sam Worthington, Jessica Chastain, Jesper Christensen, Marton Csokas Meet Rachel Singer, known as the agent killer of the infamous Nazi surgeon of Birkenau ? Dieter Vogel. Now thirty years later her daughter is publishing a book about the mission her mother worked on. Rachel, along with David and Stephan, were going to kidnap Vogel and take him back to Israel where he would face court for what he did to Jews during the Second World War. But what really happened at this mission? Rachel thinks back, this mission scarred her for life, but it also made her life what it is today, now she has to face the truth and realise that the mission still is more important than ever before. Will the world find out what happened or will Rachels life stay the same? The Debt is a thrilling and dramatic story. The first ten minutes, you sit there thinking "what the f**k" but then when things starts to make sense it is actually quite entertaining end exciting. The film is very unpredictable, and it will have you guessing at what is going to happen next. The story is good and the acting is very good. Helen Mirren and Jessica Chastain both do an impeccable performance, as they have to speak with an accent and more than one language. The storyline takes place in West Germany after the Second World War, and you can see that through the set and costumes. All in all it is an entertaining film, but a little too "Hollywood", and you walk away from it thinking "it was good, but I don't feel the need to watch it again".The Debt is a American remake of the original film "Ha-hov" from Israel.Rolling the dice: 4for more reviews: http://malinlystad.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does everything well enough to keep you watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having not seen the original version of this film I review it for its own worth as a drama involving the hunt for a Nazi war criminal, which studies how things compound upon each other when a plan does not quite go according to how it was written. The story is ostensibly a subtle study of characters, on the one hand the Mossad agents, Rachel, Stephan and David, Doktor Bernhardt, and Rachel's daughter who unwittingly plays a pivotal role.The first developments in the film demonstrate that all is not well with the three agents some thirty years after their mission, and we are slowly witness to the reasons why as, using flashbacks, we see what really happened as compared to what was claimed to have happened. The action in this part of the film is beautifully constructed as the character developments so fluidly form.We are made to wait for complete revelation of the whys and wherefores, and the reason for the "Debt" until towards the end of the film, but it is superbly well acted out by the strong cast who pick up from where our younger flashback actors left us.The story is very well told, is full of tension and suspense, and poses questions about all the characters we observe before the credits roll.It receives a wholehearted recommendation from me, especially if you enjoy strong plots rather than constant action. Eight out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performances!...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very well made film which I found notable for the performances of those involved. With the action being split between two time-lines there are two actors for each of the main parts; Helen Mirren was excellent as Rachel Singer (1997) and I thought Jessica Chastain was equally good in the same part circa 1965. Tom Wilkinson was great (as ever) as Stephan Gold (1997) with Marton Csokas doing a fine job in 1965. Finally there's Ciarán Hinds who did a good job as David Peretz (1997) and Sam Worthington did an excellent job as the 1965 version. I should also give a mention to Jesper Christensen who did a great job as Doktor Bernhardt / Dieter Vogel.Based on the Israeli film, "Ha-Hov" (which I haven't seen), I could see parallels with the Steven Spielberg film "Munich". Surprisingly, there is a long section of the film that concentrates on the events in Berlin which I thought was maybe a bit too long. There needed to be (IMO) a little more grounding in 1997 as that is where the film ends. Having said that, I did find this tale quite gripping with an unexpected outcome. I liked the way certain details were kept from the audience until the action switched to 1997. Over all, an interesting drama/thriller with some great performances; I just felt it needed a little more? Still, worth a look.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED.My Score 7.1/10IMDb Score: 6.9/10 (based on 28,779 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 65/100: (Based on 37 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 76/100 (based on 165 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 67/100 'Liked It' (based on 30,552 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping and tense. Very solid film making with sterling performances.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering the film has a title about as captivating as your average e- mail spam folder, it's turns out to be pleasingly engaging thriller. Before we start it's worth noting this is a remake of a little seen 2007 Israeli film of the same name. The story circulates around three Mossad operatives in the 1960&#x2032;s and their brave attempt to capture Dieter Vogel a.k.a "surgeon of Birkenau", a sadistic Nazi war criminal played by the excellent Jesper Christensen. Structurally, the film cuts between two time periods. As well as witnessing events around the attempts to apprehend Vogel in the 60&#x2032;s, we see them played by different actors in the aftermath thirty years later. In a way, it feels like two films glued together. The 1960&#x2032;s segments are by far the strongest, Jessica Chastain in particular making a very strong impression. Thanks to the acting presence in the 90&#x2032;s sections though (Helen Mirren, Tom Wilkinson), the film never goes so far as to disengage for which director John Madden deserves credit. Unlike Steven Spielberg's 'Munich', which clocked in at 2hrs 44mins and did feel baggy, 'The Debt' has a sensible, get in and get out run time that keeps it well focused. The ending might not work for some, but when it came i felt as though the film had done enough to get away with it. An efficient and workmanlike thriller with themes of revenge, regret and truth. 3.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An action film of a slightly different sort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a feeling The Debt was made with an older demographic in mind which is great. I went into this completely blind, having no idea what it was, although I did remember seeing a trailer a long time ago. I suppose it could be considered action but also a drama. The story unfolds definitely slowly. I found the pace too slow at times which dragged down the story just a little bit. Even still the performances of the movie and the story itself makes it interesting and entertaining enough.Helen Mirren, Tom Wilkinson and Ciarán Hinds play the older characters and all do a solid job. I always find Wilkinson kind of dry but Mirren and Hinds boost the cast enough that all three of them do well. Their younger selves are played by Jessica Chastain, Marton Csokas, and Sam Worthington. Chastain is excellent, she is probably the highlight of the time and it is believable that she is Mirren later in life. The same cannot be said for Csokas, and Worthington. They simply are not believable that these two men became Wilkinson and Hinds. But on their own they do a decent job. Both pairs of men as younger and older characters are sort of dry throughout. Jesper Christensen is excellent as the evil Doctor that plagues them throughout their careers. He gives a worthy performance.Director John Madden is a very English director, having directed a handful of well received films. I say that he's very English because even the style of the film is distinctly English. The content and pacing is always just a little bit different in an English film and The Debt has that distinct feel. I suppose it sort of combined action with drama but was heavier on the drama side. It is worth seeing, some might really really enjoy it but be warned that the pace is a little slow and some of the performances a little dry. Regardless it is worth checking out for something interesting. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Opening :- The Debt was an out-an?out thriller that keeps you at the edge of your seat along with astonishing performances by Helen Mirren and Jessica Chastain. The Story :- The thriller starts in 1997 at a book launch which sent shock waves to the three heroes ? Rachel , Adam and David. Immediately , the movie takes us back to 1965 in Berlin where they are given the task to kidnap a surgeon , responsible for killing thousands of Jews. They succeed in kidnapping the surgeon Vogel but mission fails when he escapes from their house. As it would bring a shame to these people , they lie to their country Israel and sooner they become the heroes. After 35 years , when Rachel's daughter writes the book on the event , one such journalist is again contacted by Vogel who promises to reveal the truth. To track down his whereabouts , Rachel goes to Russia to hunt him down and save their reputation from being jeopardize. The review So , overall , I loved the film. It had a very well told story , fine performances and a tight script. The direction was handled superbly and so was the screenplay. The back ground was enthralling. The entire star cast acted well but it was Helen Mirren and Jessica Chastain who stole the show with their riveting performances. The bottom line If you are looking to be thrilled and is expecting some twist and turns in the plot , this is where you belong? Good : 3.5 / 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Debt" - An engrossing, morally complex thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In director John Madden's "The Debt" (co-written by Matthew Vaughn &amp; Jane Goodman and Peter Straughan), a trio of Nazi-hunting Israeli Mossad agents in 1966 Cold War-era East Berlin, Germany, are hot on the trail of Dr. Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christensen), the "Surgeon of Bierkenau," who perpetrated a number of inhuman experiments against concentration camp prisoners during the Holocaust.The heroic trio of Mossad agents - Rachel Singer (Jessica Chastain), David Peretz (Sam Worthington), and Stephan Gold (Martin Csokas) - all obviously have their own personal motivations and a strong vested interest for seeing Vogel brought to justice to be punished for his World War II-era crimes against humanity. Eventually they do track down their quarry, kidnap him, and hold him prisoner for a time before they can turn him over to the Israeli government in order to stand trial for his crimes against humanity. This is easier said than done, as they hold Vogel in their decrepit East Berlin apartment building and he plays on his captors' psyches, expressing his out-right contempt for Jews and even sharing a little bit of baffling empathy toward them. In his attempts to get inside their heads, he also begins to take advantage of the strong air of sexual tension arising between the three in their painfully cramped, decrepit little apartment structure.Of course, we know from the opening minutes of "The Debt" that the three will have eventually succeeded in their mission, that Vogel was killed during a brazen escape attempt, and that Stephan, David, and Rachel are being praised as heroes in Israel. 31 years later in 1997 as the three are nearing (or already in) retirement age, the world around them has changed drastically and a new generation of young people is just now learning of the horrors of the Holocaust and their heroic exploits in bringing a feared Nazi war criminal to justice. The 50-ish Rachel (now played by the gracefully aging Helen Mirren) is a grandmother, and her daughter is publishing a book about their efforts to capture Vogel.Just as the celebrations are about to begin, 50-ish David (Ciaran Hinds) inexplicably kills himself by jumping in front of a bus. The elder Stephan (Tom Wilkinson) isn't shedding any tears, but as the film progresses, we learn that things between the three are not what they seem. They all have deep, dark personal secrets leading back to their 1966 mission that are bound to come out in the present. And the three are also forced to contemplate the meaning of justice for those who perpetrated the atrocities of the Holocaust.And this is what "The Debt" is really about - the moral complexity of seeking justice, and the illegal mission the three agents have undertaken to capture Vogel. The dark secrets and truths each individual has about their quarry's time in captivity with them are ingrained into the memories of the film's three chief protagonists and those who have read about their exploits over the three decades since they first transpired.And although Helen Mirren has top billing here, it is really the actress playing her character's younger self, Jessica Chastain, who really stands out here. She is the one who engages in and survives some of the film's most chilling encounters, including early in the film when she poses as a fertility patient with her "husband" David in the clinic where Vogel has presumably set up a new identity as a gynecologist, and she must let him give her some highly invasive medical examinations. And I also loved Sam Worthington's portrayal of David Peretz, the one Mossad agent with the most personal and emotional baggage, and the one with the most vested interest in seeing that the horrors of the Holocaust do not go unpunished; I must admit I wanted to see this movie mostly because of him, as I consider Sam Worthington to be one of my favorite actors of the moment (especially after seeing his magnificent performance in "Avatar" two years ago)."The Debt" alternates nicely between past and present, though for some this could be a little jarring and annoying as the truths about of the past are painfully, shockingly, revealed in the present. A remake of the original 2007 Assaf Bernstein-/Ido Rosenblum-co-directed Israeli film "Ha-Hov" (which I have not seen and I'm not sure if it was ever released outside of Israel), "The Debt" is a first-rate spy thriller and dramatic action experience. I highly recommend this powerful feature to anyone who is tired of the typical Hollywood thrillers of late, and wishes to watch one with a strong moral conscience.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Of days past...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Debt" is a thriller evocative of days past and movie like "Three Days Of The Condor", "Marathon Man" etc. John Madden has crafted a deftly directed and written film whose strengths derive from the characters and the story, the tension and the build-up in emotions and high plot points evolve naturally, not forced by ridiculous shortcuts, mindless action and meaningless cinematic devices (such as an overload of special effects, an intrusive soundtrack or overly evocative imagery).The movie does contain a plot twist but it is not as preposterous or intentionally misleading as in for example a M. Night Shyamalan movie...When it is finally resolved it neatly fits with the story and it becomes understandable as to the characters motivations and need to portray themselves in a certain light while reality is significantly different.The ensemble cast is terrific here and the modus operandi and set-up of the movie in different time-lines with the cast divided accordingly is a great add-on and it also works. Jessica Chastain, Marton Csokas, Sam Worthington (showing here that he can act), Hellen Mirren, Ciaran Hinds and Tom Wilkinson respectively prove that actors can work in concert and of off each other to create not a chaotic free-for-all but a nice acting thread for each character.An entertaining movie, gripping story, acting and atmosphere, a good way to revive the spy thriller genre which over the years has been cheapened with mindless action popcorn types or pretentious bulls*it movies passing themselves as some-kind of new type of intelligent flicks...as will be the case with "Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol". "The Debt" is everything that movie isn't, and that is a compliment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY, this is a well-acted, well-crafted thriller that takes its theme from a past era and hopes we care enough to bear with that. THE DEBT has the advantage of being partly (50-50) set in the late 90s and it packs two of its most exciting scenes into the opening five minutes, which certainly aids concentration.Rachel (Helen Mirren), her husband (Tom Wilkinson) and her former lover David (Ciaran Hinds) are espionage heroes in Israel because, 30 years ago, they caught and killed a Mengele-level Nazi torturer (Jesper Christensen) living under a new identity in East Berlin. But the trio are hiding a secret that will undermine their hero status if it it comes out. Rachel is tasked with making sure that it doesn't.The flashback scenes to the ex-Nazi's capture in 1966 (with Jessica Chastain as Rachel and hunky Sam Worthington as David) are as grittily filmed as anything in an early Le Carre story. A kind of reverse Stockholm Syndrome sets in between captive and captors. But it goes on too long and the plot requires one very clunky development. The present-day plot with Mirren isn't quite as tense but it's more tightly scripted and delivers a (slightly predictable) shock ending. Mirren and Wilkinson speak with over-egged accents that are only an "oi-veh" short of Ron Moody's Fagin!Again like T.T.S.SPY, this is kind of old-fashioned movie-making, but with some disturbingly modern scenes of violence. A bit dated but gripping and, at its heart, a Biblical theme: Vengeance is mine, says the state of Israel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong start, weak ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beginning of this movie is extremely strong. We see three hesitant young people stepping out of a cargo plane at an Israeli airport. 'Take a deep breath', says one of them. It's as if he is warning the audience for what comes next. In the first 20 minutes of the movie, we see a gala event where a proud daughter presents a book about her clearly uneasy mother, a flashback showing an intriguing fight with a man getting killed and a woman hurt, and a very spectacular suicide. We know the events are connected. The girl emerging from the cargo plane has a bandage on her right cheek, the uneasy mother has a scar at the same place and the woman in the flashback has wounds on the right side of her face. The script also gives us clues: the daughter tells about her mother being 25, and the flashback is a chapter from the book she has written, read by her mother at the gala event. Sounds complicated? It is. The movie starts by giving the audience story elements that fit together when the film evolves. It's about three Mossad agents trying to kidnap a war criminal in East-Berlin, but failing to do so. A large part of the movie shows the goings-on in Berlin, where the three agents are in constant fear of being discovered. The war criminal, who is being held captive in their apartment, plays cruel psychological games with the three of them. The triangular relationship between the three agents complicates matters even more. This part of the movie is very good, and ends with the fight we have seen at the start. But here, the movie takes a surprising twist. I found the last part of the film, which is set in the present, less convincing. It gives star actress Helen Mirren more screen time, but could just as well have been a short epilogue of a few minutes. This part has some improbable twists. And in spite of Mirren's star power, I found her performance less impressive than the one by the talented and beautiful Jessica Chastain, who is the central character in the Belin part. In spite of all this, I very much enjoyed watching The Debt. It's a well made espionage thriller, with some exciting scenes, and an intelligent script with some nice surprises. The performances by Chastain and Mirren are extra reasons to go watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The worst Cold War movie I can remember. The parts that were supposed to be suspenseful we're so drawn out I forgot I was watching a movie. Facts were wrong, anachronisms abounded so I couldn't focus. The idea that a woman in 1965 would walk around an apartment in her towel with two guys and then hang around in a robe while they were fully dressed was so ridiculous as to make any sexual tension unbelievable. Maybe I am just too old and can remember how radical it was when I did similar things in the late 1970s. The guys in 1965 would have been afraid of this woman.The sappy sentimentality of Mossad agents sympathizing with a Nazi butcher was also too boring and unbelievable to me. This movie seemed made for children of the 2000s or maybe the 1990s. This is not a four star movie which implies that it is a classic. There is no way this movie should outlast The Terminator.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of those under rated gems, thoroughly captivating throughout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movie gems hiding away waiting for the true film lover to appreciate. Such a well executed story it would be presumed to have been based on a true story. Even though it contains lesser known actors, they seamlessly portray the whole bag of emotions all great films contain. This film is captivating throughout with ever changing turns and twists. Prepare for a perfect blend of action and drama between a trio of foreign Israeli agents chasing a once notorious war criminal in hiding.Normally not a fan of the switch between present and past that seems to be the most recent trend, however in this example the director uses this in a totally inspired way. Telling the story in well connected chucks and leaving each time step with most questions answered. This allowed the story to flow into the final path taken which at 30 years later in the story is unexpected. A lengthy film that you will never want to end?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the movie and read the reviews after-wards I knew I had to act immediately. I love thrillers in general, especially when they are well made or told in such a way that it keeps you guessing, or/and glued to your chair for what comes next. This is one of those movies. Just excellent; script-wise, story driven, choice of cast, locations, direction and so on. Usually I do not like to read the full plot story of a movie before I go see it, because it kills so much (takes away) of the suspense for what is going to happen. So knowing too much makes me wait on that info/thing to happen in the movie. There is nothing more irritating then that. Acknowledging the fact that individuals really do know how to write reviews on movies, dissecting the whole thing thoroughly. I advise you not to read those reviews, because they already programmed an opinion of the movie/scene in your head, if you have read it of-course. The Debt is an hugely underrated espionage thriller with a wonderful cast. The performance of the actors is excellent. The story is told in a way as any good espionage thriller should. The climax is not over the top as many will tell you. RECOMMENDED!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about three secret agents entering East Germany to kidnap a war criminal, to bring the criminal to Israel for trial. A secret during the mission haunts them thirty years later."The Debt" begins with snippets of events in the present, and these events are very confusing. Once the story from thirty years ago unfolds, everything makes so much sense. The storytelling is superbly thrilling and engaging. It kept me glued to the screen, waiting to see what would happen next. The hostage subplot thirty years ago is very intense, particularly the part where the doctor verbally provokes David. That speech by the doctor is spine-chilling.The present day events in the second half of the film are also very engaging. The ending bit is particularly good, as it brings up a moral dilemma. I think "The Debt" is a superb thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Debt is a remake of an earlier film from the 90's which I previously have never heard of so I'm not sure exactly how faithful a remake it is but I have to say that this film is absolutely fantastic. I am an enormous fan of Jessica Chastain so that was why I was originally drawn to this movie and she once again proved that she is probably the most versatile and gifted actresses working in film today. The storyline is a truly thrilling story, all the twists and turns that the film takes will have you guessing right to the end about just what could be happening, sometimes I find this a tad annoying as it can be far fetched but with this movie it works terrifically. The cast are astounding, Helen Mirren shines as usual, particularly towards the end of the film and Sam Worthington does a great job of being tough but equally emotional, however this film belongs to Jessica Chastain, as with everything she ever does she is absolutely jaw droppingly good, she is just astounding in whatever she does, her character is a strange one but Chastain manages to make her relatable, in anyone else's hands the character would have been far different I think.There are some truly edge of your seat style scenes in The Debt, one involving a doctor, Chastain and medical equipment, and another involving Helen Mirren in the hospital towards the end. The ending somewhat disappointed me when I first saw it but after thinking about it I thought it probably would have been a tad cliché if it was done any other way. This movie is almost flawless, so it is definitely worth being seen. It's hard not to appreciate a great film like this, it's just a shame that they don't come along more often.Excellent in every way!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not only about the usual Isreali revenge story and it's quite different from Spielberg's Munich (to which "The Debt" has nothing to envy). This flick is an extremely gripping thriller featuring many turns, twists and reversals in a perfectly recreated Cold War setting. Acting-wise Helen Mirren is outstanding as usual but Chastain and Wilkinson as well leave a very significant impression. On the whole the architecture of the movie is smart and flawless, many action scenes are exciting (especially the one set in East Berlin but also the fight with the Nazi ob gyn physician) and the acting's absolutely strong. To sum up an intelligent espionage thriller with a moral dilemma and an excellent cast</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite solid if unspectacular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always had a slight fascination with Nazi war criminals and their pursuers. I can't tell you why, exactly, other than the obvious appeal of justice being done but regardless, the whole concept always piques my interest. I never miss a film that centers on this subject and if I come across a TV show that delves into the subject, I'll record it every time. "The Debt", therefore, has been on my radar for quite some time. Originally slated for a late 2010 release, it's been pushed back a couple of times until finally being dumped at the end of the summer, which is never a good sign. Still, with its quality cast and interesting subject matter I went in to "The Debt" with relatively high expectations and was rewarded nicely for my patience.In 1966, three young Mossad agents are sent to East Berlin and given the task of capturing Nazi doctor Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christensen) and bringing him to trial in Israel. The team consists of Stephan (Marton Csokas), David (Sam Worthington), and Rachel (Jessica Chastain), who is the key to their plan as Vogel, known as the Surgeon of Birkenau, has been working as a fertility doctor since the end of the war. Posing as a wife unable to get pregnant, Rachel drugs Vogel and her teammates smuggle him out of the clinic. But when their plan to get him across the Berlin Wall fails, the agents are left to wait in East Berlin with their silver tongued hostage. On a rainy New Year's Eve, Vogel is shot dead during an escape attempt, allowing the agents to return home without their prize but as heroes nonetheless. We fast forward 30 years when rumors begin to circulate about a great secret the agents have held on to since that fateful night in Berlin. With their reputations on the line, it is left up to Rachel (now played by Helen Mirren) to cover up their secret once and for all."The Debt" weaves a compelling tale that doesn't so much keep you guessing as it does keep you engaged, a slow burn that stalls at times but never becomes boring. It's a fairly straight forward thriller though the narrative unfolds in a non-linear form, jumping back and forth between 1966 and 1997. "The Debt" is taut and director John Madden (not that John Madden though now that I think about yes, yes I would watch a movie director by that John Madden) does an excellent job of keeping the film's momentum moving through the first two acts. The third act was a bit of a letdown for me. The conclusion is fairly obvious and while I don't think it was the desire of the filmmaker's plan to keep the twist a giant secret (I believe you're intended to know the majority of what's going to happen) I would have liked the film to get to it with a little more urgency. Where "The Debt" excels is in the outstanding performances of its pitch perfect cast. Top billing goes to the older versions of the Mossad agents, Mirren, Tom Wilkinson (Stephan), and Ciaran Hinds and each hold their own. Mirren is asked to do the most work amongst these three and she does a solid job of exhibiting the mark the weight a 30 year secret would leave on a person. Wilkinson isn't used much, quite honestly, and isn't given much to work with. Hinds, though, is exquisite in each of his limited scenes. One of my very favorite "Actors Who Rarely Get Starring Roles but Are Always Awesome No Matter How Little Attention They Get" (a list known as the "Barry Pepper All-Stars"), Hinds absolutely nails his role and made me want for more. As their younger versions, both Csokas and Worthington give strong portrayals. Their characters are dramatically different, Stephan overflowing with arrogance and confidence while David boils with quiet rage, and each is given depth by the actors. Jespersen, too, gives Vogel a terrifying aura of refined hatred and menace. Vogel really isn't given much room to develop but Jespersen makes the most of his screen time.But in the end, "The Debt" hangs entirely on the performance of Chastain who gives Rachel equal parts fear and courage, which is exactly what I would imagine an inexperienced field agent would have when confronted with a monster like Vogel. Her portrayal is measured and cautious and often her best moments are those in which she does not speak but instead lets her eyes and body language do the talking. You have to wonder what life must be like for Chastain, an actress that virtually no one had heard of at the beginning of the year. With only a handful of credits to her name, the best of which is a short stay on one of the "Law and Order" spinoffs, by the end of the year, she will have appeared in no less than six films in 2011 and has vaulted herself into the "Leading Lady" category. In a film featuring some incredible actors who have garnered a ton of attention over the years, it is Chastain who stands out and who carries the film. It is a terrific performance.In the end, I don't think "The Debt" as a whole is equal to the sum of its better parts. There's a lot of good here but beyond Chastain, there's nothing truly great about the film. Madden and his group of writers (including "X-Men: First Class" director Matthew Vaughn) have crafted a quality thriller that has plenty of moments but isn't overly impressive. In essence, it is good but not special, though certainly worth the price of admission.Please check out my reviews at ieatfilms.com and thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An action film at the speed of two elderly people in hand-to-hand combat.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WEEKLY MOVIE REVIEW : THE DEBTONE LINE REVIEW : An action film at the speed of two elderly people in hand-to-hand combat.RATING : Don't waste your time (Rating System: "See it in theaters", "Wait for the instant download", "Don't waste your time")SOME SPOILERSRachel Singer (Helen Mirren) is a retired Israeli spy with a secret. She went on a mission in 1965 behind the Berlin Wall to capture and bring to trial an evil Doctor Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christensen) who was responsible for unspeakable crimes against Jews in the German concentration camps during the second world war. Her secret is that something went wrong and nobody's talking. Her ex-husband Stephen Gold (Tom Wilkonson) had gone on that mission with her along with David Pertez (Claren Hinds). At a celebration of a book written about her heroism, Rachel learns that David has killed himself, and now-head of Masaad Stephen knows why.Back in 1965, Young Rachel (Jessica Chastain), Young Stephen (Martin Coskos), and Young David (Sam Worthington) capture the doctor and must keep him on ice for a couple of weeks. What ensues is a love triangle with all three members in a claustrophobic environment.And we're off..."The Debt" is a difficult film to review because it is two movies in one. On the one hand it is the story of an aging spy coming to grips with the lie she told to protect herself, her partners, and her country. On the other it is the story of three young spies in love carrying out a mission of the cold war - left over from the second world war. More over, it is the story of a love affair gone wrong. And the sacrifices that these people make.This not only makes it a difficult movie to review, but it also makes it a difficult movie to watch. The majority of the action takes place in 1965 and is interesting to watch. Jessica Chastain and Sam Worthington deliver tense performances and Martin Coskos is the domineering force behind the team. I felt drawn into this world and was eager to see how it would all play out. As the evil doctor, Jesper Christensen delivers an understated and believable performance.In contrast, however, the now-present-world is not so interesting. The opening 10 minutes of the film feature major characters entering and exiting automobiles to go places that we don't spend much time in. We finally return to the present-world at the end of the movie where Rachel must deal with the effects of her decisions in the past.(BTW: haven't we just seen Helen Mirren in "Red" - a story about aging CIA agents kicking butt and taking names? Is this the only role for mature actors?)IMHO, either of these stories would have made a riveting movie. But we spend more time in the past with Young Rachel than we do with Old Rachel. The problem with this is that all the stuff that happened in the past is merely the set-up to the problem Old Rachel has to solve. And she solves that in the last 10 minutes of the film. We don't get deeply invested in either Young or Old Rachel and it ultimately makes for a dull ending.And the ending is dull. I won't spoil it for you here, but it is both slow and unbelievable.So, for a divided story, slow motion action, and unbelievable climax, I recommend you "don't waste your time."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A total BOMB</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the few movies in my life I wanted to walk out on. The first hour was slow stupid and BORING. Jessica Chastain whom I loved in tree of life played this role with th dazzling smile of Julia Roberts and not much else. The writing regarding the 2 male agents was god awful! The 2 men were stiff and wooden. None of them had any charisma at all. I cant discuss the plot except it was totally unrealistic and so full of holes it could be an outstanding swiss cheese. This is The MOSSAD people, one of the great government agencies in the world and they all seemed like amateurs. Helen Mirren looked awful and her role was so simply badly written even her talent couldn't overcome it. The ending was the single most preposterous one in the history of film--it was repulsive. If you have ANYTHING else to do (like having dinner), Do not see this film. (except as a lesson for film students. I had NO INTEREST in any character. I just wanted to get out of the theatre and try to get this out of my brain. It was especially dismal to me because I have seen 5 wonderful movies this summer. Simply AWFUL!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unpredictable and Suspenseful Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Video review: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYmxCULsEaoThe film is about three Israeli Mossad agents who got famous for capturing a notorious Nazi war criminal in 1966. The details remained secret, but the trio struggle to keep some revelations from coming to light. The film takes place in two different time lines in the 60's and the 90's. This movie starts out completely hard to understand in my opinion. The intro flashes by fast and I had a feeling that because of that I was going to be confused for the rest of the movie. It shows us the characters in their older age first and I'm unaware on which character was even part of the mission. Once the 1966 storyline begins, I started to understand what everything meant and it all started to make sense to me.So, if I just so happened to be watching this at home I would have turned it off in the first 10 minutes because I would be completely confused. I'm glad I didn't give up on this. This is a thriller that builds tension every step of the way and to my surprise because I didn't even know this was going to be a thriller. I thought this was a movie about accounting. Seriously. The concept of Jewish people seeking revenge while under cover completely reminded me of Inglourious Basterds. And it wasn't just the concept, I also got that kind of vibe from the suspense. And that could never be a bad thing!We were introduced to an older character at the beginning that looks exactly this guy Stephan, but it turns out the character is actually the older Sam Worthington. If the movie didn't actually use their names to tell us who was who I would only be able to tell by the personalities. And the personalities, including facial expressions stick. Some pretty darn good facial continuity there.The cast is overall pretty good. Everyone is great, but then you have Sam Worthington who has developed a reputation of wooden acting. I happen to agree with this as he always seems to have the least defined personality. This is an improvement from his narration from Avatar as he isn't too bad in this except he doesn't really have that many lines. It's almost like his limited acting range suited the role that he was in. There was a moment when he talked German it seemed like he was a completely different guy, but for all I know it could have been dubbed. The absolute best thing about this movie is that it's completely unpredictable. It was a blessing that I went into it completely confused rather than knowing what was going to happen from the very beginning. The film plays with it's suspense and the surprises were strong enough to make some people in my theatre gasp. If that isn't good suspense, I don't know what is. 8/10, I think you should give this film a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Tell the Truth or Not Tell the Truth?That is THE Question</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Engaging Film has two Major Problems. The jerky, nothing but irritating, jumping from Timeline (1997) to Timeline (1965), Past and Present is neither interesting Montage or Helpful. It is totally unnecessary. The Subject Matter alone, the Mossad Agents tracking down and apprehending a Nazi Butcher, is involving enough. No need to Fancy it up with Cinematic Editing. The other Problem ties in with the Time Shifting. The 1965 Cast and the 1997 Cast look nothing like each other to the point of Distraction. So with two strikes against, why is this Film so Captivating. Because the Villain, both 1965 and 1997, is played so Despicably and Believable, He steals every Scene from these Fine Actors.Overall it works, despite itself, drawn along by Tension and Personal Conscience Testing. The whole thing has a Downer of a Tone befitting its Subject Matter and is a Gloomy Matter. The Casting and the Time Traveling may not be the way to go here. That is Debatable. It is also Debatable whether or not the Heroine makes the Right Decision to tell the Truth or Not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good story but falls flat in the middle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We meet Helen Mirren in '90s Israel as a celebrated Mossad agent who was one of the three who pulled off a daring mission in East Berlin in the '60s. When Tom Wilkinson her ex-husband and second of the three informs her the third, Ciaran Hinds, has committed suicide, we realise All Is Not As It Seems.Flashback to '60s East Berlin. Jesper Christensen is suspected of being an infamous concentration camp doctor. He is now a gynaecologist, which explains Jessica Chastain's presence. In the tensest part of the movie the trio identify him, snatch him, and take him to the exfiltration point, which is where things go wrong and they return to the safe house.At this point you might be looking forward to a chase through an East Berlin swarming with alerted Vopos as they find some ingenious way to get the doctor over the wall. You'd be disappointed. Instead, they sit in the safe house getting angsty and playing mind games while they wait for orders. More than 20 minutes (I timed it) of deflated expectations.It picks up later as the older ones deal with the consequences of youthful decisions, but never reaches the heights of the first part of the movie.In addition, the relationship between Chastain and the other two agents, intense Sam Worthington (young Hinds) and charismatic Marton Csokas (young Wilkinson), didn't ring true. Maybe if Worthington had been the leader and decision-maker her attraction would be explainable. Some ingenious twists, and excellent performances from Mirren, Chastain, Csokas and Christensen, show us what a really good movie this could have been if better structured.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do not miss this Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just finished viewing this fantastic film and, having enjoyed it so much, I am moved to add my positive comments to the many others on this site.Brilliant film all round: great script, direction, acting, filming etc.While the background subject matter refers to one of the darkest tragedies in the whole of human history, this only helps you to understand and fully believe the motivation that drives the protagonists in the plot.And this drive, relying on clever writing and direction, makes this film far superior to so many other suspense thrillers that have an over-reliance on the use of special effects to engage the audience. I was literally on the edge of my seat throughout the film and some of the clever twists in the plot showed me that my premature assumptions (about what I was initially thinking was a poor choice by the director &amp; writers) were completely way out. Instead they made the film.The actors were all great, especially Helen Mirren, Tom Wilkinson, Jessica Chastain, Martin Csokas, Sam Worthington and Jesper Christensen who plays the Nazi war criminal Vogel with such clever skill that it makes his quietly spoken character in some respects truly frightening. The movie's use of flashbacks and flash-forwards (approximately half the movie taking place in 1966 and the other half taking place in 1997) meant that you needed to be focused on what was going on, but in my view this added to the enjoyment. While some other reviewers and critics have criticised this aspect of the film, and the ending, I found it most enjoyable. A movie that challenges your intellect to me is always far more rewarding than so many of the other straight, boring narratives that are on offer. And this is not the sort of art-house pretentious challenge that I abhor, it's just about enjoying a really satisfying movie experience.If you like good movies, especially drama/thrillers, don't miss out on seeing this one. I rate it 9 out of 10 and amongst the best films I have seen in the last few years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What if the greatest accomplishment of your life was a lie? What if that lie had become big enough to destroy not only your reputation, but those of your accomplices and your only daughter?Rachel Singer (played by Jessica Chastain as a young Mossad agent with no field experience in 1966 and by Helen Mirren in 1997 as a hardened veteran scarred by her past) is tasked with assisting two experienced operatives in the apprehension of a Nazi war criminal so that he may be tried and, in all likelihood, executed in Israel. Her colleagues are two men she'd never met named David Peretz (Sam Worthington in 1966 and Cirian Hinds in '97) and Stefan Gold (Marton Csokas in '66 and Tom Wilkinson in '97). Their target is Dieter Vogel, (played by Jesper Christensen) a man given the moniker "the Surgeon of Birkenau". And when we first learn of the mission we are shown Rachel (Chastain) unable to prevent Vogel's escape and shooting him after being beaten and cut in her confrontation with Vogel. These events were chronicled in a book written by Rachel's daughter and that portion of the book is being read aloud by Rachel at a luncheon publicity event. After the reading she's informed that Peretz (Hinds) walked in front of a truck rather than be escorted to a meeting with Gold (Wilkinson) and an associate of his.Suddenly Rachel is racked with guilt over her part in their fractured relationship. Their falling out was precipitated by her budding romance with Stefan and a shared deception that David could no longer live with. Stefan and Rachel soon resolve to correct their mistakes in hopes of sparing their reputations and that of their daughter Sarah (played by Romi Aboulafia).I love World War II movies as much as anybody does and more than some. There are few cinematic events as enjoyable as watching a sociopath get what he most definitely deserves. That said, this film gives the viewer a sustained uneasy feeling and leaves you with the question of 'what now' and doesn't do anything to answer it or soothe the discomfort. I suppose every film that doesn't inform the viewers with an epilogue leaves viewers with that question and even those that do have epilogues still leave some questions unanswered but with such a great premise and a truly impressive cast, I expected more and I didn't get it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cerebral and Emotional Espionage Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If only 2011's Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy had been directed in a linear fashion with flashbacks (even allowing for a brief chronological switch back and forth in the timeline), perhaps that movie would have been a taut spy thriller. Instead, director John Madden gets the credit to creating in The Debt an intelligible, mental drama that includes a lot of relational, emotive power and putting the action in a secondary, background motif that adds to the drama. Eerily, the young Stephen's character played by Marton Csokas has this Russell Crowe/Kevin Spacy impersonation going on unintentionally which is both somewhat distracting but fascinating. The script is tight, the twist is powerful, the acting captivating, yet the movie contains fundamental weaknesses, including a war criminal that seems too conveniently to provide only briefly any doubt as to his personality and what the audience as well as the protagonist must do or expect, the twist in the movie is also somewhat inconsistently handled in a brief scene by the older characters in their support or opposition to what needs to be done, there is a break-in later in the movie that seems all too easy even considering the technology used. Finally the ending seems to be a cop-out of sorts, perhaps deliberate scripted to ensure that controversy and black-listing would be avoided, thus bypassing the more provocative issues between truth and integrity, between noble justice or revenge, the director seemingly incorporating the best of both worlds, however, uneasily.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The subject is WW2 crimes by a famous German surgeon who experimented on Jews, maiming or killing lots of them. In 1966 an elite team of 3 Isralis, two men and a woman, are assembled and sent to East Germany. Their mission was to capture the doctor and bring him back to Israel for trial.Not everything goes as planned. They end up fabricating a story and all vowing to take it to their graves. The title refers to the "debt" incurred from all those 30+ years of keeping a lie. The forward part of the story is set in 1997.I enjoyed it, a good story and it doesn't turn out like I expected it to. My wife was less enthusiastic about it.SPOILERS: As the woman (Helen Mirren) is reading a chapter of her daughter's book of the mission, to a book signing audience, we see the story acted out in 1966. The captured doctor breaks loose, beats her, but she gets up in time to see him in the street below, running away, and is able to shoot and kill him. But when we see the actual scene replayed he gets away. The 3 of them agree to the lie, that he was killed and his body disposed of. It works for 30 years, although 2 of them are deeply bothered by it. The old man is found to be in a Russian hospital, there she tracks him down, she injects him after a fight, he dies and she is wounded badly. We don't know for sure if she survives, but probably not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawed thriller but worthy of a watch thanks to Chastain.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring:Helen Mirren, Sam Worthington, Jessica Chastain, Ciarán Hinds, Tom Wilkinson, Marton Csokas, Jesper Christensen and Romi Aboulafia.Directed By:John Madden.Review:I was looking forward to watch this movie back then because it looked interesting to me, i really feel some weird anticipation for these espionage thrillers. This movie was quite delayed but released finally last year and i saw it a few weeks back. It didn't turned out quite classy or a perfectly structured thriller movie but it surely was a good watch and nice time to spend. This movie has some twist that are worth looking to and the end which may or may not completely spoil your mood but overall it just was a worthy entry into this genre which surely need movies like these to survive. Now the story follows time shifting, back in 1966, Mossad agent Rachel Singer played by Jessica Chastain meets her fellow agents David Peretz played by Sam Worthington and Stefan Gold played by Marton Csokas in Berlin. Their mission is to capture a surgeon who had some horrible medical experiments on Jews in the 2nd World War and to bring him to Israel. I wont be revealing the tiny details about the movie but when they try to do so, the fail and then they have to bring the surgeon to their apartment tied while waiting for their next move. The surgeon escapes from their and Stefan decides to tell a lie to everyone that they have killed the surgeon, they are later being honored by the government. Not Stefan but David and Rachel can't live with this lie their entire life where later you will see one of them trying to do the thing they were suppose to and the outcome of it all.I agree that this isn't your regular suspense thriller with all you see is several missions getting completed step by step with careful and detailed developments followed by a happy and conclusive ending. This is a much more simpler and real look at a mission that actually may go wrong and even one bad decision can ruin there entire life, the anger and rage they have for their own people to have suffered the holocaust can then drive them to the levels where they risk their own lives and people around them but things they couldn't do back then, they have to do it now or they will die with regrets that no one wants. The ending was quite painful to watch for me specially due to the character of Rachel as she is the strongest and the main of them all. Jessica Chastain had the best year any actor had or even think of having with such great movies and brilliant performances and being in every other movie released. She is the best thing about the movie. I must say they had a bit casting problems, when i read some of the reviews before i saw the movie, i thought that was ridiculous to point out towards the wrong casting choices. But it wasn't until i saw when i realized they weren't wrong at all. You might not find any problem with the Chastain- Mirren casting but in the older David and Stefan roles it is confusing and almost ridiculous.Helen Mirren did a fine job and played the character really good, she have done many movies after her The Queen win that doesn't always represent her to her utmost acting abilities, she needs more awards contender movies for sure. The real best thing about this movie is the wonderful, gorgeous and a outstanding performer Jessica Chastain who is cast perfectly and she delivers a believable and honest performance. In some scenes where she has to flex some of her muscles for some fights and things, she does it like any other female action movie star. Chastain is once again the best thing about this movie. The need to have focused more on the time shifting narrative option and should have utilized that more as the ones taking place in the real time were the weakest scenes in the movie, it honestly feels like the whole movie is shifted or that both of them were directed by two different directors, that is a flaw which makes this movie a bit down or else it is somewhat intelligent and smart if not too smart offering enough twists and thriller moments that you can look for apart from the flaws that it has.Rating:3/5C+Follow My Blog: Hollywoodandme.Blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jessica Chastain vs. Helen Mirren as The Same Character? **Spoiler Alert**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From her profile, Jessica Chastain certainly resembles Helen Mirren. However, Jessica Chastain has a slight cleft chin, and it bothered me throughout the film. Both were great in the film, but they could have hidden the cleft chin with makeup or latex or something. When David committed suicide, it didn't register with me WHO had just been clobbered by the vehicle. Maybe I missed something (I should watch a DVD alone after watching it with family members.) Anyway, it would have helped if they did a tiny flashback of the suicide near the end of the film to tie it all together.And everyone else is right about the young versions of David and Stephen -- the actors should have been reversed. It was quite confusing during the exposition of a film to have figure out who's who.Still, I would recommend this film to others... if I know that they can handle the continuity of the story. Some folks just can't follow films that aren't sequential (i.e., Pulp Fiction). I like the intrigue of watching the film a second time, so I better understand the foreshadowing and nuances that the filmmakers included. My family doesn't want to sit through the "extras" on a DVD, and they were in a hurry to return it to Redbox.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Debt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are several ways to settle a debt. An especially intense way is to kill someone and have that be that. When the troubled minds of three people who are personally affected by the heinous acts committed by a certain Nazi doctor, that's precisely what they mean to do. The only time things get complicated is when everything does not go according to plan. I'm not talking about the kind of plan that falls through and you're like "I guess we'll order pizza and stay in since those guys bailed on us." I'm talking about the kind of plans that fall through and lead these three people to working shifts as they care for the Nazi doctor they meant to kill and dispose of.Much like a newborn, captive Nazi doctors need almost constant attention. When they get fussy they must be fed and bathed and things of the like. Rachel, Stephen, and David (Jessica Chastain, Marton Csokas, Sam Worthington) have good reasons for wanting to kill this particular man. Nazis have earned a pretty bad reputation. I'm looking at you, Hitler. This Doktor Bernhardt (Jesper Christiansen) really has it coming. He has done some dark deeds in his day and will pay the price. Do you get it yet?I remember seeing the preview for THE DEBT and thinking to myself "Boy, I'm not going to see this movie. That young Julia Roberts look-a-like gets her face all jacked up and I just can't stand brutality against the face of a pretty young gal. Or any face for that matter." Yup, that was my original thought. Well, as you may've guessed, I did see the film. The movie was fine enough. The acting on the part of Ms. Chastain in particular was impeccable and I have never had a complaint regarding Helen Mirren who plays the older Rachel. She is one of the finer actresses in Hollywood. I think that Sam Worthington probably did something to personally offend whoever was in the casting department because they sure did not let his character age well.As far as movies go, this isn't typically my style. They did throw in a nice little twist that was pretty cool, but I'm easy, so I don't really know for sure whether or not the movie was fantastic. However, consider your source, readers. I am a girl who loves explosions, things that go bump in the night, and a nice heavy dose of artillery. I don't know when this happened because I was raised on Disney films. But I digress? back to the film at hand. The storyline isn't cookie cutter and I like that. It moves along at a very nice pace that kept me interested the whole time. The ending though? I don't know what it is about endings. I haven't been pleased with probably 90% of the endings of movies I've seen this year. This one wasn't bad for the reasons that the other ones were. It's like this. I don't mean to sound insensitive or cruel or anything, but I don't like to watch elderly people do much of anything. Eat, kiss, drive, and especially battle to the death. Let your imagination wander on that one.****Please visit www.mssilverscreen.com for more of my reviews and musings****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie with Flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good Drama movie. The movie moves very slowly at first, and takes a while to pick up. I fell asleep the first time watching it, woke up a couple of times but was lost as to what was going on. So I tried to watch it again the next day and succeeded. Again, the movie starts off slow, and does take sometime to pick up.My main complaint about the movie, besides the extremely slow start, is the 3 Israeli Captors. I found their actions to be contradictory and puzzling at best. The doctor whom they took captive for the some of the most gruesome and heinous war crimes and crimes to humanity, was being treated differently by each captor. There was a "Disunity" and a internal conflict going on within the Captors themselves, but also within their group as well. The lead woman, Racheal, played by Jessica Chastain, did a excellent job. I really enjoyed her performance, and it was nothing short of marvelous. Her character in the Movie, as we find out down later on in the film, is too weak, emotionally and psychologically, for what the mission they are about to embark on.From a viewer stand point, I really felt the treatment of the Captors, considering the atrocities committed by the Doctor, was very unrealistic and contradictory at best. This is not the actors fault, but the fault of writing. This film was beautifully acted, by the writing, and the actions of the Captors and their decisions, just didn't measure up or answer the brutality or atone for the brutal history committed by the Doctor.I give it a seven. It is worth watching, but the actions and the decisions of the captors may disappoint you or even make you angry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Debt is good but not great, interesting but not gripping. In my opinion, this movie has a ho-hum quality to it. Most of the acting was good, but the actress who played the young Rachel was not quite believable; the character just didn't have much depth. Helen Mirren and Tom Wilkinson, while they have little face time in the movie, were, as always, good. My main problem with this movie is that it feels shallow. John Madden, the director, did basically nothing to bring the horrors perpetrated by the Nazis into the movie and therefore into viewers' psyches. There were a few photos, and once in a while you can sense, through the characters, that the Nazis' atrocities are driving the Mossad agents' lives. However, Madden fails at getting anywhere near the psychological depth of the Holocaust. For a movie like this to be successful, the director has to get the viewers to feel the Nazi horrors and therefore the compelling reason for the agents to do this mission. All in all - this movie could have been one that stays with viewers for days. As it is, it felt like "just a movie", "just a made-up story".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine cast in a weak fictional film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fine performances of the entire cast of "The Debt" are my only reason for giving this film six stars. The story had good potential as a post-Holocaust and World War II thriller. But its very subject -- an operation by the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad, is what loses credit for the film. That's because of the several failings of the agents in the operation. It wasn't long into the film when my attention was drawn more to the mistakes of the expertly trained agents, than to the mission itself and the intrigue surrounding it. So, I soon found myself watching for the next mistake instead of being engrossed in the story itself. I don't think that's what the filmmakers want of any audience. But, I suspect this may have been true for any number of other viewers as well, judging from some of the reviews I've read. While any covert operation is bound to run into a glitch here or there, I don't know of any true events that have had so many glitches. This movie of course, is fiction. But consider some of the real covert operations that have succeeded for Israel. On May 11, 1960, Mossad agents abducted Nazi Adolf Eichmann from Argentina where he had been in hiding since 1950. He was tried in Israel for his leadership in the Holocaust and was hanged in 1962. Numerous other operations by the Israeli intelligence network have occurred in many countries. And, on July 4, 1976, Israeli intelligence and the military planned and carried out a huge counter- terrorist effort. Operation Thunderbolt was the name of the Israeli commando raid on the Entebbe International Airport in Uganda. That raid covered more than 2,500 miles to free the remaining hostages of an Air France flight that had been hijacked. It took just one week to plan and carry out the raid. A TV movie was made on that operation in 1976 -- "Raid on Entebbe." So, in "The Debt" we have a fictitious operation carried out by three agents in 1965. Mossad was established in 1947, and its agents were highly trained and expert in all aspects of covert operations. Indeed, the movie shows their hand-to-hand combat skills early. Only one of the agents ? Stephan Gold (played by Tom Wilkinson and Marton Csokas) appears to be fully competent though. But even he fails to make sure that Dieter Vogel is completely secured when they begin their escape. Had Vogel not been able to honk the horn in the van and draw the attention of the East German guards, the abduction-escape looked like it would work. The young Rachel Singer and David Perez made mistake after mistake. They violated training and listened and reacted to the talk of their prisoner, Vogel. In both instances, it led to serious errors on their part. But, even after those errors, they didn't recover. In the first instance, David doesn't think to clean up broken pieces of a dish that could be used to cut ropes ? as Vogel indeed used a piece of broken glass to get free and then to attack Rachel. Rachel also failed to clean up the entire mess herself. And, when she saw that Vogel had gotten free, she walked into the room where she could be attacked from behind. She didn't alert her fellow agents first. She didn't pull her gun, and approach the room by checking each side. She just walked ahead with a dumb-founded look of disbelief that the prisoner wasn't still tied up where he was. Is there a single viewer of this film who didn't know she would be attacked from behind? Now, I credit the actors with very good performances. But, the script and direction that had these agents act like such stumble-bums is a very poor characterization of what may be the world's most competently trained and able covert agents. But, even with Rachel's seeming lack of security and pursuit training, she seemed to be able to take down her two male agents, both much bigger men and close to her age. She showed that ability again when she was able to subdue Vogel in his doctor's office. She was 25 and he was close to 60. But, he defeats her after he escapes following a heavy beating by David. And then, at the film's end, the once again alert but not alert Rachel is taken down by Vogel. Only this time, she's 57 years old and he is over 90 years old. So much for her abilities.Other aspects of this film ? wrestling with truth, selfishness versus concern for others, etc. get convoluted and don't find any resolution. So, the ending is probably right on. We don't know if Rachel lives to see her daughter shamed or not. But, she has taken the steps to see that that will happen. And then there is the tough David who was so bent on justice for one of the Nazi henchmen who contributed to the killing of his whole family. He is so hurt in conscience by the travail of their failed mission after 30 years, and the thought that nobody else knows the truth, that he has to step in front of a truck to end his own life of misery. Maybe this film is more about pride than anything else. That would explain why the agents would lie ? to cover up their incompetency. Instead of for the good of all Israel ? as Stephan argued. This movie might have one redeeming value. It could be used as a training film for new recruits and old hands in the security and intelligence fields. It shows what not to do, and what happens when one doesn't follow his or her training.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Snoozer to Twister to Twisted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first hour of The Debt suggested that this movie was going to be another Manichean moral tale with the good Mossad agents tracking down the evil Nazi so that he could be brought to justice. The tone and quality were reminiscent of something from Lifetime TV channel. It seemed overly heavy and super serious and more educational than entertaining. Which is not to say that movies relating to the Holocaust and its aftermath should be a barrel of laughs. (I, for one, found Life is Beautiful to be highly distasteful and inappropriate.)Because this movie was so slow moving, I actually saved the second half for the following night. That's already a red flag: not a fast-paced suspense thriller. In fact, The Debt does not really become a thriller until the second half of the film, when it finally emerges that what we really have here is an essay on truth and lies. The dominant theme becomes an examination of what the fear of sullying one's reputation can drive one to do. At this juncture, the potential for something wonderful and profound suddenly comes into view. I was fully prepared to forgive and forget the plodding opening in anticipation of what was yet to come.Unfortunately, the final quarter of the movie takes a turn for the worse, descending ultimately into something close to a slasher genre film. A senescent slasher genre film, to be more precise, given the advanced age of the protagonists. Really, the gore is completely overdone and the circumstances which conspire to make the gore possible are utterly preposterous. The primary positive take away from this production was that it did not fulfill its initial Manichean promise, thankfully. The human-all-too-human quality of Mossad agents and Nazis alike is highlighted rather than the childish "We are good, and they are evil" trope, of which I, for one, have had quite enough.A couple of final technical gripes: Jessica Chastain's accent was annoying, and as far as I know microformat cameras did not exist in the 1960s. Did they plug that little SIM-card-sized device into a laptop computer to retrieve the necessary data? Don't think so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Truth' or 'The Truth That Needs To Be Said'? this is one of the dilemmas facing the heroes of 'The Debt', which is quite an exotic entry in the list of films made by John Madden, the exoticism being that it's well closer to the pattern of routine Hollywood thrillers than movies like Shakespeare in Love or The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.There are however a few reasons that make this film interesting, even if you are not necessarily a fan of Mossad action movies processed by the American commercial cinema filters. This is the story of an unfinished business which involves a team of Israeli idealistic young agents of Mossad trying to capture in the 60s one of the notorious war criminals modeled on the image of 'doctor' Mengele. Their mission takes them in no other place than East Berlin in the days of the Cold War, and when things go wrong they have to make extreme choices - not only about life and death, but also about absolute and convenient truth. The story alternates between the 60s and the 90s, which opens another kind of question mark about whether big mistakes can ever be fixed. Of course they can, it's Hollywood stuff after all. This does not necessarily result in a great movie.While the premises are interesting the execution is far from brilliant. Director Madden brings nothing new in a genre that had so many successes and even more failures, beyond quite a rigorous and detailed rendition of the East Berlin atmosphere. The biggest failure is however in the way he directs the characters of his Israeli heroes. They behave and talk like no Israeli, and even the setting of the scenes supposed to take place in Israel in Israeli location does not help. The approach is superficial and does not go too deep beyond the crust of the characters, and this crust does not seem genuine at all. I love Helen Mirren, she is best as queens or chief-detective roles, and I found even her acting as a retired agent in the RED series to be delicious. Here she undertakes another retired agent role, and I am sorry to say, she is not at her best. At the end of the screening I remained with the feeling that the makers of this film still have some 'Debt' to their viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In real life, older Israeli puts bullet in Nazi's head</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie, though it is obviously full of flaws. I thought all three of the actors who played the Mossad agents were exactly right for their parts. The Nazi was not made into a caricature but rather a bad man who still loved his wife and took good care of his patients. The one terrible casting was the Ciarin Hinds character, who looks nothing like Sam Worthington, and is so whiny that there is no way that Helen Mirren would remain in love with him. The problem with this movie is that it conforms to the new Hollywood take on Mossad and Israel, first revealed in MUNICH. This Hollywood Mossad gets things wrong because they are both stupid and overly emotional. But this new Mossad must always have an American liberal-like character who is so noble as to protect Nazis (or Arab terrorists). When the plan went sour, the team leader would have put a bullet in the Nazi's head, left the van in the woods somewhere, and left the country. And not thought twice about doing it. Fortunately, Israel and Mossad are smarter than depicted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This acting is amazing! The cinematography is as well.It's so good; it's easier to just write my one thought on the script itself. To be fair too, reality is reality.. This is not the subjects first movie impression and there must be cultural, generational, muti-lingual interpretations.The way these-three-agents, are portrayed so well trained, I felt that some of the "unprofessionalisms" could have been changed. Like the three of them being seen in public together; while the woman could name the Opera Theater in her I.D. of her supposed hometown.. Or; the morning of the kidnapping; while walking out together (agents) you could almost insert your own line, from his look, "Oh, you "screwed" him" etc. of course the fear and trepidation portrayed the humanness v/s their training, was a "Tetter-Totter" ride anyways!On the other hand; the sexual indiscretions, or, however viewed, were needed for the plot. I feel it makes them more human, as well.I would've liked to seen more substance opposed to the juxtaposition of Phenom Spy to love triangle.Please don't mistake me. This is an EXCELLENT movie love the twists and turns..I enjoy movies that don't need to rely on set design; although, it is (set wardrobe location) is excellent too, stunning in an unobtrusive way.A definite must see. A definite re-watch!This is just what's in my brain, after watching. It certainly piqued my thoughts~</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romantic Triangle derails Gritty Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the kind of thriller that reads better in romance novel than on screen. Almost like a James Bond film, there is love, intrigue, danger. It doesn't hurt when you cast a trio of fashion model beautiful secret agents. The movie follows these three people, who sometimes seem to be more interested in jumping in bed with each other than doing their job. Our suave secret agents live in East Berlin during the cold war, hunting down a nazi criminal. But the movie centers more on the love triangle, with the evil doctor as audience. Production and direction, however, try to be more grounded in realty. Their apartment is drab. Rachel, the female agent, does not wear hot clothes or hang out in ritzy locales. Instead she sees a doctor with the criminal past several times in a drab clinic. The movie is at it's best when portraying the uncomfortable vulnerability when Rachel is his patient. When the film turns to present day, the repercussions of their actions are left unresolved. Rachel needs to finish off the evil doctor. But then the third act turns into somewhat implausible spy thriller sequences, especially an after hours visit to a newspaper office that stacks up too many coincidences. The newspaper office scene was so off-the-wall bad that it pretty much took me out of the movie. Although the climax works things out OK, most of the machinations of the plot did not seem compelling. In this day of revelations of historical events that occurred differently than the accepted past, I find it not such a crushing blow that these agents didn't fulfill their mission, even with the subsequent hoopla.And gosh, if you live a lie, don't trumpet in a book, like you are daring the evil doctor to be found and ruin your career. I can't really recommend this thriller/romance combination, because you expect a film starring such attractive secret agents to deliver the 'exotic' allure of a foreign country. Instead it is a gritty and unglamorous location. The screenplay did a good job at telling this story with jumps in time, and Helen Mirren as always does an amazing transformation from Queen of England to scarred and troubled mother. I wish I could recommend this film based more on the competent filmmaking than the unappealing and unbelievable romantic interplay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite some problematic casting, a very good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Debt" is a thriller that takes place in two time periods, 1997 and 1965, when three Mossad agents, Rachel, Stephan, and David (Jessica Chastain, Martin Csokas, and Sam Worthington) set out to capture a Nazi war criminal, Dieter Vogel, the Surgeon of Birkenau (Jesper Christensen). The film actually begins in 1997, when Stephan's and Rachel's (now Tom Wilkinson and Helen Mirren) daughter Sarah has written a book about their heroic exploits. Apparently, David (Ciaran Hinds) has now reappeared after being away for years, and Rachel has just seen him. Stephan, now in a wheelchair and evidently divorced from Rachel, asks her to accompany him to David's apartment. It seems that these three have a secret that they never shared with the world, and that secret, one way or another, is about to be exposed.A really excellent story with strong performances by everyone involved and great direction by John Madden. Some very tense and dramatic scenes as we see the events of 1965 when Dieter Vogel was kidnapped and the events that follow. It's an amazing story of love, lies, bravery, and redemption.One small problem others have complained about is the casting of young Stephan and young David -- the actors should have switched roles. With Ciaran Hinds looking like a big, tall man, there's no way that the younger actor could have morphed into him. The other actor looked more like he would have aged to be Ciaran Hinds. So it was confusing to audience members -- it wasn't to me because I had read all about this confusion ahead of time.Highly recommended - how can you miss with Helen Mirren and Tom Wilkinson, some excellent screenwriters, and fine direction?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Debt" focuses on some Mossad agents who set out to capture a Nazi war criminal in 1960s East Berlin...and the secret that they've kept since then. The really tense scenes are those in Berlin, but the 1990s scenes with Helen Mirren as the aged agent on a new mission are also really good. The movie deserves praise for not being a series of high-action sequences. I should say that the movie is occasionally a little confusing due to the shifting back and forth between the past and present. I also noticed that in the Ukraine scenes, it sounded as though the Ukrainians were speaking Russian, although there are majority-Russian areas of Ukraine, and the languages might sound similar.Anyway, the movie is definitely worth seeing. Also starring Tom Wilkinson, Sam Worthington, Jessica Chastain, Ciarán Hinds (Aberforth Dumbledore in the Harry Potter movies), Marton Csokas (Celeborn in the "Lord of the Rings" movies) and Jesper Christensen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a thriller and drama you won't regret watching. Read the IMDb full storyline and the official website's accounts; I try not to repeat that sort of thing and hope to stick to the experience of what I see. No doubt, there are two leads here, because there are two time periods which you see intertwined effectively. Academy Award (and many others) Helen Miren delivers just what you come to expect, so no need to expand. Jessica Chastain, who I was less familiar with, does an outstanding job and you haven't heard the last of her, that's for sure; she plays in two other good 2011 movies, 'The Tree of Life' and 'The Help' (my upcoming review and Oscar contender).The co-stars Martin Csokas, Sam Worthington, Jesper Christensen,Tom Wilkinson and Ciarán Hinds are all fabulous; Csokas and Worthington have more to do in their roles and are doing most of the action scenes as Chastain is, because they play the young Mossad agents (as opposed to the retired ones). The revelation for me was Christensen; as Dr Vogel he depicts the madness and evil that was Vogel with perfection and once you've seen the movie you'll understand why. All good actors excel at one common role, that of the dark character, and Christensen did exactly that; Vogel was cold, calculating, cunning and evil. Wilkinson and Hinds have recognition for their past performances and deliver their parts as the pros they are.The script, as some reviewers point out, has good parts and some which the discriminating movie-goer will find fault with. I did not have too much problems with it but detected some discrepancies you'll likely not noticed unless you watch an inordinate number of movies as I do. Regardless, 'The Debt' will give you your money's worth; I'm certain I'll watch it again with friends who haven't yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good but just short of outstanding.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having visited East Berlin and Kiev during communist times, plus various Nazi concentration camps throughout Europe, the story and setting of this film could not have been more interesting from a personal point of view. So to mention immediately, I was not totally convinced by everything about this film, but that said enjoyed it and would recommend it as one well worth seeing.The acting throughout was either very good or excellent, with two sets of the same three characters, two men and one woman, which is self-evident almost from the start so nothing lost by mentioning that here. But some advice. Keep a close note of the names of the characters, because physically, the actors, even allowing for the intervening years, could not possibly be the same person, namely Ciaran Hinds and Sam Worthington respectively, as the old and young David. Just to confuse the viewer, the young Stephan looks rather like the old David. Bit of dodgy casting there I am afraid.The one real down-side to the film's credibility even though, ironically, it included the best scenes,is the total incompetence of the three Mossad agents when they have to deal with the Nazi doctor. Mossad has a very fearsome reputation for thoroughness and professionalism and these three agents committed just about every elementary mistake in the book. Not believable and that should have received attention without losing the excitement.My two favourite performances in the film were Jesper Christensen, who played the hunted Nazi Doctor quite brilliantly. Equally good was Jessica Chastain, whose name had sadly passed me by to date, but not anymore.The viewer will have to make their own mind up about the ending, its authenticity and satisfaction. I am still thinking about that as I write, but feel it could have been better. The ending was somewhat bizarre and was possibly one of the least satisfactory parts of the film certainly when compared to the excitement that went before.Full marks to the photography, design and production with compliments too for the music. The film got on with it and the director used every minute to the fullest extent.So just short of a terrific film, probably mainly due to the fact that the story of its present (1997 and 7/10) was not as remotely dramatic as the story of its past (1965 and 9/10).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cast, lots of hype means....BORING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie gets an A for assembling a cast and putting out previews but seriously lacks in any real follow through. Put this movie at the bottom of the heap and watch on a night when you can't seem to fall asleep because this is pretty close to a sleeping pill. The Acting is OK but the A-list actors only comprise bits and pieces of the movie and are hardly able to turn this film into anything more than a snooze fest. Frankly this is one of those movies that Helen Mirren did just to pay some bills and probably only took a few days of her time. I expected much better from the hype the trailers gave out, but then again most movies these days fall completely flat compared to their big budget advertising. My take away is if you want to see a Nazi hunter film, subscribe to the National Geographic channel and watch a documentary on the real thing. It would be more entertaining than a bland film over hyped by it's studio.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Debt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Helen Mirren as a covert agent is nothing to scoff at since she had played the role with aplomb in Red, which makes this an all too recent revisit to a similar role, though here it's less of the comedic factor, and packing a more serious tone in its examination of truth, which in all essence is what one tells, and how others interpret, subject to compromised witnesses all involved in a myriad of reasons to rationalize their very untruthful actions. It stabs at our reality system and checks, and makes you wonder, with conspiracy theories, just how anything can be trusted at all if there are those hell bent on deceiving and living a lie.Directed by John Madden, who spots a pedigree in his filmography such as Shakespeare in Love, Captain Corelli's Mandolin and Proof, to blips like Killshot. But I suppose his experience bode him well here, as he balances powerful drama with intense action that is vividly realistic, without going over the top like most action films, but deglamorizes every throw, punch and kick, and shows how brutal things can be especially when it doesn't flinch from the intention to kill. A remake of the Israel film Ha-Hov, The Debt tells a rather fragmented story about three Mossad operatives who are tasked to bring back a Nazi doctor who had experimented on the Jews during WWII, and does so in two different timelines when the operatives were young and idealistic, and the other when they're already senior citizens.In the first instance, the young Rachel (Jessica Chastain growing her prominence in Hollywood as a leading lady) joins two seasoned operatives in Stephan (Marton Csokas) and David (Sam Worthington) in East Berlin in the 1966, where they painstakingly live out their alter egos while waiting for the instruction to strike. Days pass through training in martial arts Krav Maga and honing their accent to perfection, while staking out their prey and conducting necessary surveillance of their plan and escape route, which in a way plays out like a Heist movie through their meticulous planning right down to the last detail. Their target Doktor Bernhardt aka Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christensen) is now a gynecologist, and the entire narration through to the middle act which picked up when the plan gets put into motion, turns from a heist film, to one involving psychological horror as Vogel just knows how to push the buttons of his hunters, especially when they find that their avenue to escape with him alive is fast closing and tightening, with a key turn in the events that springs up a huge surprise.The other timeline involves the much older trio of the hugely scarred Rachel (Helen Mirren) who's now estranged from Stephan (Tom Wilkinson), now a parliamentarian, and the aloof David (Ciaran Hinds). Celebrating the successful launch of her daughter's novel about Rachel's heroism in that mission, we slowly see the cracks beginning to form, and how their world starts to come crashing down, hard. Things are not what they seem, and John Madden manages to keep everything under wraps, peeling off the layers expertly through flashbacks and throwing in sucker punches at the narrative, written by Matthew Vaughn, Jane Goldman and Peter Straughan, enabling one to question and yet understand how the trio had made a key decision they have to live a lifetime by. And this moral dilemma is what lifts this film and built suspense, keeping us riveted at the different versions of truth, what constitutes truth, and how living a lie and gaining everything the world had to offer, was something hard to resist.Somewhere in the narrative a romance formed between the characters too, a romance that wasn't what it had started off to be, where lust arising from an uncertain future complicated matters, and escaping from one's comfort zone is out of the question. Although fleeting and never quite well formed, the cast's excellent nuanced performance in their characters' attitudes in this aspect provided that bit of emotional resonance outside of being calculated and cold due to their mission at hand. While Sam Worthington was absent for the most parts of the film and easily having the least screen time, I thought he did best with his character here, besides having to totally lose control of himself when confronted with unimaginable evil in front of him, and while resigned to a fate he himself had agreed to, made the story a lot more poignant when everything is revealed toward the end.The Debt is that rare thriller that grows on you as the narrative progresses, one that provides you the different perspectives of the characters and the huge baggage each had to bear through a joint pact made. It severely questions just how we can live with lies, and the guilt that comes associated with that, before recognizing that only the truth in unadulterated terms, will set one free. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie -- Cast is Great, but Wrong!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a well-done, intriguing movie. Loved all the twists that it took, as well as the play with time. All the actors are beyond excellent. But, I am writing this review because I cannot stop wondering why the casting director would intentionally cast Marton Czokas as the young version of Tom Wilkinson when he is physically, at least, nearly a dead ringer for Ciaran Hinds. On top of that, Sam Wilkinson could easily be the younger physical match to Wilkinson. I easily spent half the movie reminding myself that Marton was not Stephan. Needless to say, this was a bit disconcerting. At the end of the film, I expressed my thoughts to my companion -- apparently I wasn't the only one who felt this way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's nice to see 'Mr. Blockbuster' Sam Worthington stretching a little.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'THE DEBT': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)American remake of a 2007 Israeli film, of the same name, about three secret agents sent in to East Berlin in 1966 to capture a notorious Nazi war criminal. The film jumps back and forth between 1966 and 1997 as we see the three agents recalling the events of their mission forty years earlier. It stars Sam Worthington (otherwise known as 'Mr. Blockbuster', of 'AVATAR', 'TERMINATOR SALVATION' and 'CLASH OF THE TITANS' fame), Jessica Chastain (the Bryce Dallas Howard look-alike whose been getting a lot more work than Howard lately) and Marton Csokas as the three agents in their younger years and Helen Mirren, Tom Wilkinson and Ciaran Hinds in their later years. The film was directed by John Madden (of 'SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE' fame) and written by Matthew Vaughn (who also produced the film), Jane Goldman (a usual writing partner of Vaughn's) and Peter Straughan. The film is an effective spy thriller, nothing spectacular (and I expected a little more considering the talent involved) but a decent flick even so.The story revolves around Mossad agent Rachel Singer (played by Chastain and Mirren) and focuses around her 1966 Berlin assignment when she was teamed with agents David Peretz (Worthington and Hinds) and Stefan Gold (Csokas and Wilkinson). They were given the assignment of capturing Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christensen), also known as 'The Surgeon of Birkenau' (for the atrocious medical experiments he conducted during the war) and bringing him to justice to face his crimes. Rachel and David take cover as a married couple from Argentina and Rachel also poses as a patient of Vogel's at the clinic where he works. During their assignment a love triangle develops between the three with an unplanned pregnancy also developing between two of them. This causes complications which are further aggravated when the mission becomes compromised later on. At one point they're forced to return home and stretch the truth to their superiors and the rest of the world. A lie that later comes back to haunt them. The film is an interesting and involving character study but only to a certain extent. Chastain is great in the lead and so is Mirren (like always). It's nice to see Worthington stretching a bit as an actor and doing something other than a big budget, big visual action spectacle but his character is probably the least developed in the film. What he does do with the little material he does have is impressive though and he manages to draw a lot of compassion (from the viewer) to his heart felt performance (I just would have liked to have seen more of it). Christensen is memorable as the movie's monstrous villain but Wilkinson overacts a little. The rest of the cast is underused for the most part and the film feels a bit rushed in plot development (despite a somewhat slow pace and small amount of action and thrills). The love triangle is believable though, especially Chastain and Worthington's part of it (and the duo presents a decent amount of chemistry while pulling it off). Madden's directing is fitting and the script is well written but like I said the film feels a little too condensed. As a whole it's entertaining and interesting while you're watching it but nothing most viewers will probably remember to well years from now.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFgJwfpDzmc</fullReview>

Let me give you this much, it was a great espionage film that had the all the right elements. The stars did a wonderful job of making the movie entertaining and the story had you on the edge of my seat a few times. The overarching subplots are quite involved and they do a decent job of keeping the past and the present characters in line. I would say that the best part of the film is the dynamic between the characters.

		<fullReview>Very enjoyable movie, a good spy thriller that brings together fiction and non-fiction very well. Sometimes during the movie I was wondering if I was watching more of an entertaining documentary instead of a fictional movie about the cold-war and Isarel's secret activities during those times. If you like real type spy stories, this this is an enjoyable one. Nice transitions between 1997 and 1966 to the very present time the movie is being set in. Would have preferred a more conclusive ending, but it does make you wonder a little. Be warned this is not a fast paced - shoot-up, explosions left/right, with big car chase scenes etc., like you see in the theaters normally. Just a good spy movie !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very disappointing. Poor implementation of flash-backs confused a weak story-line to the point that, without prior knowledge of the holocaust context, you may well have thought that the Nazi butcher was the hero of the movie.The Jewish influence in 'the-movies' really must think hard before they do their next 'lets-make-sure-the-holocaust-is-not-forgotten' movie. Surely they want their product to be successful outside of their captive Israeli market. Certainly, this is not the way to go about it. Also, I note the many good reviews I have seen about this movie. This is the kind of movie that gets an automatic thumbs up just because of the subject matter. I wonder how many of those people who posted a positive review actually: watched he movie at all; watched it all the way through; reviewed it outside of the holocaust context (which is how it should be judged). Not many, would be my guess.Come on Mr Madden. You can do better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good spy thriller with emotion and character development</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot of this movie isn't as amazing as I thought it would be. But it's a good spy thriller that is also engaging and has a good amount of character development. Some critics claim this movie reminds them of "Munich" and to some degree it does. This isn't as entertaining as "Munich" but it has more emotion going for it and has just as much humanity going for it. The real driving force of this movie is the performances, the performances actually makes this movie riveting. The cast is really good, even Sam Worthington who I thought of as a boring actor in the past stands out. Helen Mirren is a awesome actress in this which wasn't a surprise. The movie does feel slow at times but that is only a small complaint. It would also have been nice if there was more depth to the mission and made the mission a bit more entertaining and interesting to watch. Overall this is a good spy thriller with good amount of depth to the characters. The main flaw is how it dragged out the story way longer than it had to be.7.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mission a Success?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people live with secrets from their past. Rachel, Stephan and David, 3 Mossad agents, were assigned a top secret mission in 1965 to capture and return to Israel an infamous Nazi war criminal. Their success is a major victory for Israel against the Nazi war machine ? or was it? The movie begins with a book premier about the mission undertaken by Rachel (Helen Mirren/Jessica Chastain), Stephan (Tom Wilkinson/Marton Csokas) and David (Ciaran Hinds/Sam Worthington) written by Rachel's daughter. The book is going to be a huge success as these three ex-Mossad agents have been local folk heroes in Israel for the past 30+ years and this will only add to their fame and glory.The future is still looking bright for our agents and the journalist turned novelist until some unsettling information comes to the attention of Stephan, who's current high level position in the Israeli government may be threatened if this information turns out to be true.The movie plays out as a series of flashbacks revealing "the truth" of what happened those 30+ years ago in the safe house of East Berlin.Overall this movie is suspenseful enough to keep you interested for the 114 minute run time ? although I found a few parts to be somewhat slow. It is a worthwhile view. If you can't get to the theater to see this latest film, the 2007 Israeli film of the same name is currently available on Comcast "On Demand" free movies. It too is a very worthwhile film (subtitled in English for those of you who do not speak Hebrew/German/Russian). I am not sure if I would have liked to have seen the Israeli version first or not (moot point as I viewed the Hollywood iteration first) ? but both films are done well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is worth watching, but it is slow. There is a lot of bouncing back and forth between past and present day. This is to keep the viewer in the dark until the last minute. Unfortunately, there was not much surprise as the movie and the relationships involved are quite predictable. The acting was superb by all actors/actresses. This is definitely a drama and not an action film. This is not a bad thing, but the trailers do tend to make it look a little more like an action film. I suspect that there will be several Oscar nominations for this film. Mostly due to Hollywood and the subject matter of the film. I do think that some acting is worthy of Oscar nomination. The film itself is good, but not Oscar worthy. Still, I'd put money on its nomination. It's worthy of seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too bad........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry folks, but not much joy in this brief review. Ciaran Hinds is great, as usual, but there's little inspiration in the rest of the cast. Kudos to Jessica Chastain, who plays the young version of Helen Mirren. She's all that saved her half of the movie.Shaky-cam, ultra-closeups and jagged, quick cuts are the sign of a director who says, "I don't know to create tension in a scene, I know I'm a buffoon when it comes to staging an action sequence, but maybe if I make it unwatchable, if they have to divert their eyes, nobody will notice." It's all in here and it works, you can't watch what should be the exciting parts.I could go on and on, but I'll stop with the slowness of the movie. It's excruciatingly slow for long periods. I almost left two or three times but finally, after what seemed like forever, there was a twist which led eventually to a rather mundane ending.The good parts, and there are a few including a slam-bang beginning, are too few and far between. The old Nazi, alas, is mostly squandered, with only brief hints of what could have been high drama.I can't recommend this movie; I wish I had my two hours back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Skillfully Constructed Thriller with a Nimble, Stimulating Center</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the beginning, there are ill-omened allusions. The retired agents carry their notoriety like a burden, almost sorrowfully. Two are divorced and alienated for longer. One arrives unexpectedly, a phantom from their common history, and, almost as swiftly, departs again. Mirren boldly shoulders the literal and spiritual wounds and the acidic consequences of actions she's stifled for over three decades, largely detached, apparently resentful, with a serrated disfigurement on her cheek.Answers are given in a story inside the story, an uncoiling of memory ribbon. This inner chronicle is the pounding nucleus of the movie: The inexperienced agents, plagued by anxiety, determination and enigmatic hungers, scrunched together in a ramshackle apartment. The simmering of hormones is tangible. All the tension and kicks, not to mention the sudden eruptions of violence, have real value and import because we're afraid for the characters and their fate. Their target is Rachel's to visit routinely under the pretext of an ob/gyn patient, an overpoweringly disquieting version of the espionage femme who stakes her body for her motherland. The metal-eyed old man's tender initiation of every appointment, "This is my hand, and this is the speculum," might finally have deposed the "Is it safe?" of another Mengele standby as the most unsettling phrase ever spoken by doctor to patient. These agonizing sequences result in a scene just slightly less so, after Vogel is taken prisoner and the relationship upturned, Rachel practically force-feeding the hostage as he pleads for mercy. In between is a self-supporting play of nerve-racking power, as the agents attempt to steal Vogel past East German security and onto a train. The effect is a self-contained inner potboiler of le Carrean tone and concentration.Outstanding is Chastain, who resumes the summer of her emergence with a performance that authentically weds power and weakness. She and Mirren invisibly merge into a single intriguing body of willpower and discomfort. The other illustrious players are their natural charismatic selves, but Chastain becomes the livelihood of the events, the most sympathetic personage and the one who reveals the movie's core. The double story unraveling between 1965 and 1997, we see that Mirren's Rachel is really the disentangling outcome of Chastain's. Both actresses engrave her with a coordinated translation of a particularly multifarious character. It's refreshing to watch how smoothly Mirren and Chastain pass the Rachel wand to and fro. Worthington, whom Hollywood upgraded to leading man long before anyone established if he was a credible actor, submits on-and-off substantiation that he is indeed. Prone to vengeance and driven by profound loss, his complicated character illustrates a post-war inner health, a contemplation of the whole idea of justice. And Christensen is a gripping monster as Vogel, by turns groveling and vile.Understated love triangles, duplicity and contradictory dogmas illuminate the action, as does the acute mental affliction that accompanies the burden of a national pursuit of justice on one's shoulders. In a frame of mind like Steven Spielberg's Munich, this meticulous drama, far more keen on the fine distinctions of human actions than exploitation or explosives, contemplates the implications of such an insufferably harried assignment, in which failure is a jolt to personal and national dignity. This challenge hinges on the hub of the movie and, before the manufactured conclusion, appears to be its moral scaffold, the very kernel it was fostered from. Through the experience that binds the three central characters, we clearly ponder the puzzles and fabrications of political gallantry, especially how history may be twisted, and likewise the unadorned concept of truth. Such themes illustrate the murky perils of misinformation, the challenging freedom that lives in coming clean. Particularly, all this underscores the meaning of impartiality and ethics.Artistically, John Madden's film scarcely disappoints. The pressing plot, compelling performances and abrupt fits of brutality inundate it with an crushing level of suspense. The Debt has a far advanced intellect and significantly more meaningful characterizations. Many will feel a homecoming to the school of 1970s thrillers such as Three Days of the Condor or Marathon Man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If this were a book, it'd be one bloody page turner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw an advance screening of The Debt tonight. I'll admit, it was a film I kept my eye on once I read about it on the IMDb message boards for Avatar some time ago, since Avatar was another film with Sam Worthngton. I remember it looking pretty interesting, however I'd not heard about it for some time after due to the delays. However during July, it had gotten advertised more, and I was ready to mark down August 31st as a "must see" date. However when I got a pass in an Alliance Films giveaway, I was excited.And thankfully this movie did not disappoint. The movie comes out next week, I'd say go see it.A remake of the 2007 Israeli flick of the same name, which I'll admit to having not seen, The Debt follows two of three secret agents who went on a mission to capture the surgeon of Birkneau, and bring him to Israel to expose him for the crimes he committed against Jewish humanity during WWII. His horrifying experiments have left thousands dead in brutal and gory ways. The gang had a plan set in place, and according to a new book written about the ordeal, the mission was completed. However, something about the mission has come back to haunt them... And furthermore, that very some 30 years later, thing has the two remaining agents fearing for what happens next in life!I don't want to give too much away, because believe me, the nervousness and suspense I felt throughout the movie is unmatched by any other film I saw this year. Believe me, this film is insanely well written. Matthew Vaughn of Kick-Ass and X-Men First Class fame wrote the script, and boy you can tell he did. His charm and genius are all over the film, in a different fashion than the two mentioned films, but his clever writing style is there. The dialogue is sharp and witty, the turn of events is clever. There's loads of suspense throughout the film. Seriously, not one scene had me feeling calm at all. The film was high octane, ferociously suspenseful thrill ride that had me on the edge of my seat from the first frame.The film also has a great ability to surprise people, and believe me, this movie is filled to the brim with surprise and intrigue. The film's central twist is especially shocking. Believe me, the movie definitely toys with your expectations and perception of events in pretty much every way possible. But the central twist is especially a shocker, as it completely comes out of nowhere and strikes you blindly. At the screening, you could feel everyone tense up, and especially as the film reaches its shattering climax, the suspense just got more unbearable. However, there is some good Vaughn style humour thrown in there for good measure too.The films' performances are fantastic. Helen Mirren shines as per usual as Rachel, and her young counterpart is not only very pretty but amazingly talented too. Jesper Christensen is amazingly scary as the villain, Vogel, and he does so without any gimmicks. But the real surprise is Sam Worthington as David. Believe me, he really, truly shines here. His portrayal is very convincing, and he manages to prove to the audience that he is not just a pretty face. As well as the film's direction is slick and sharp. madden has a fantastic eye for a shot, and it shows, there are a lot of moments of visual brilliance too, and some shots even look spooky at times.In short, The Debt is the biggest surprise of the year, and a true shiner in a dark age for cinema nowadays. If you would like to watch a movie that for once isn't 3D, for once doesn't force feed you with gimmicks, don't pass up this full tilt action thrill ride. Although I saw it for free at a screening, I would have felt like my money was put to good use if I paid to see it too. Do not miss this film!OVERALL: 10/10Pros: The Debt is an action packed, unbearably suspenseful film that is remarkably well written, stylishly shot and ferociously thrilling, a film not to be missed.Cons: None I can think of...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Mossad agents ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually like tense spy thrillers, but I was seriously disappointed by this one. The "real" action takes place in 1965, when three Mossad agents work in East Berlin to apprehend a Nazi criminal.Contrary to Mossad's reputation, these are the worst agents, ever. Two young men and a woman (Rachel, played by Chastain) who get entangled in a sex triangle and mess up their mission, because they are too busy with their cavorting.Besides being unprofessional in their behavior, they are also easily influenced by the Nazi criminal, turned into hostage. If it was me, I could not care less about the babbling of a criminal Nazi, but these three Jew agents listen to him as if he was the oracle of Delphi.Back to the future, in 1995, their dirty little secret is almost out in the open. The escaped Nazi is going to give an interview to an Ukranian newspaper. Therefore, the woman (older Rachel, played by Mirren) is sent to Ukraina to silence him for good. The movie ends with a geriatric denouement. Whatever is achieved falls into the category of "too little, too late". I seriously hope real agents are made of better stuff than these three. Also, spy movies deserve more engaging characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat enjoyable to watch but not very satisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an adequately paced story with some interesting elements for anyone into WWII and cold war movies. It starts out as a spy movie and at some point it fizzes into something else, losing moral ground as if it wasn't aware it needed it. It's unclear why this story needed to be telegraphed to the world, but hey, it's always nice to see Helen Mirren even if she does look extra dowdy. The bad guy does the best acting in the whole movie genuinely giving you the creeps; it's clear the actor knows who the character is which is more than I can say for the other characters. The main characters take your sympathy for granted and fail to notice you got off the bus 30 minutes ago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great majority almost derailed by the final act.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that has a great premise but fumbles it when trying to execute properly. The idea to have a story focus on Mossad agents in the '60s, cut together with their past catching up with them in the '90s is a solid one and had a lot of potential. The problem here, for me, was that they structured it all wrong. We open with a few minutes in 1997, then suddenly jump back to 1966, where we spend a good 75 minutes of growing and unraveling the past before we abruptly shoot back to 1997 to spend the final act.When it comes to the '66 side of things, director John Madden and his talented young cast (Jessica Chastain, Sam Worthington and Marton Csokas) excel to great lengths. The setting and tone that Madden creates is appropriately quiet and dreary, giving us a sense of the isolation that these characters are facing as they stalk their prey. The action scenes crackle with intensity, which these three actors carry over so well into their scenes of being crammed in a small apartment together. Once they're stuck in the apartment, the weight of the film is thrust onto the three stars and all of them bring their A game; Csokas is dapper and intimidating, Worthington goes against type and finally displays the talent I've long been hoping he actually had by being shockingly sensitive and empathetic and then there's Chastain who delivers best-in-show work here with her vulnerability hiding behind a forced wall of courage. All three of them are top notch and the film sucked me in with watching them play off each other.The film relies so much on the actors that when we abruptly switch back to '97, I stopped really caring much. They give us three more excellent thespians in the form of Helen Mirren, Tom Wilkinson and Ciaran Hinds but then completely waste them by not giving them any acting to actually do. The '66 section worked so well because these characters were forced together under paralyzing circumstances, but when we jump to '97 it becomes Mirren on her own and she unfortunately can't stack up. She is a tremendous actress, but the film is structured in a way that the '97 story feels like such an afterthought.It feels as if they spent all of their time and attention in writing '66 that they got to the end and realized, "Oh crap, we have to explain the stuff at the beginning" and then rushed through the final act in a half hour. It feels so amateur, throwing so many things at the audience with no real explanation and then the last ten or so minutes are just loaded with one ridiculous twist after the next. Mirren tries her best, but she can't make up for the terrible writing. Here is a film that does so much of it to key quality and then fumbles the ball in the home stretch, almost derailing the whole thing in the process.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More polished than the Israeli original, but more detached</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In places, this movie almost seems to say to the Israeli original, "No, this is how you should have done it." You should have saved such-and- such a revelation till later, shown such-and-such an incident earlier even though the audience won't immediately understand it, not allowed an important plot point to rely on a carelessly misplaced straight razor. (Who shaves with a straight razor in 1966 anyway?) Certainly the American version contains improvements. But sometimes because the movie-making is so slick, it calls attention to itself and breaks the spell. So does the music, which seems intrusively witty or ironic at times.One source of awkwardness in the Israeli original was that the Israeli characters, played by Israeli actors, were obliged to speak foreign languages on their mission. In this version, actors play Israelis by speaking English in a foreign accent (or trying to), and it is hard to decode what is supposed to be happening when they discover that their German prisoner can understand them (a revelation that owes less to the original Israeli movie than to Hitchcock's LIFEBOAT). If their accented English is supposed to represent Hebrew, then why would an ex- Nazi from Germany understand Hebrew? If it is supposed to actually be English, why would Israelis speak English among themselves?Another difference between the Israeli and American versions is that while in the Israeli version the agents are tempted to cover up their mistakes because they are personally ashamed and embarrassed, in the American version they mention protecting their country's reputation as well. I think that the American version is taking an unfair swipe at Israel, implying that Israelis fear their operations can't stand the harsh light of truth. Israel owned up to its failed attempt to assassinate Khaled Mashaal in 1997, and to killing the wrong man in Lillehammer in 1973. Israel's official culture doesn't seem to be plagued by a fear of admitting mistakes.And finally, there's a curious weakness that the two versions have in common: it's rather important that the audience distinguish between the two young male Israeli agents, but the actors have the same general appearance and remembering which is which isn't easy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable Eichmann-like abduction tale turned on its head</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Debt' is based on a 2007 Israeli film of the same name. The basic plot is the same: three Mossad agents, two men and a woman, attempt to kidnap a Nazi war criminal in East Berlin in 1965 and ferret him back to Israel for trial. Of course the main idea is taken from the actual abduction of Eichmann in Argentina in 1960. There are two main differences between the actual historical event and what we see here. First of all, and most important, the Mossad operation to abduct Eichmann, albeit extremely difficult, was possible as the agents were operating in a relatively free country (as compared to the countries of the Soviet bloc). To accept the idea that the Mossad would even consider attempting to ferret a Nazi war criminal out of East Germany at the height of the Cold War, that's something I had a hard time believing. Even the Mossad, I believe, would have considered such a plan as 'too risky'.The second principal difference between the Eichmann abduction and the one in 'The Debt', is that the fictional Nazi war criminal the Mossad agents abduct, 'Dieter Vogel', is modeled on the sadistic doctor of Auschwitz, Josef Mengele, and not the banal bureaucrat, Eichmann. Like the Vogel character, Mengele posed as a gynecologist, performing illegal abortions after the war. The real-life Eichmann proves much more interesting than the fictional Vogel, pretty much a standard Nazi film villain. Eichmann, on the other hand, is fascinating since he hardly fits the mold of the typical sadistic Nazi?rather, he resembled the ordinary German you might casually bump into randomly on the street?an individual one would hardly suspect as the chief facilitator of the Final Solution. If you think about it, it didn't take a whole lot of imagination on the screenwriters' part to come up with the main plot, which involves a true-life, successful intelligence operation, turned on its head. 'The Debt' in effect is an Eichmann-like abduction gone bad. There is a historical precedent for a botched Mossad operation?the Lillehammer affair, where the Mossad assassinated the wrong man in their quest to eliminate one of the leaders of the Munich massacre. That's a more likely scenario than the unlikely events depicted here. While the botched escape at the train station hardly seemed true to life, at least it was suspenseful. But when Vogel manages to untie himself and escape the apartment, the entire scenario seemed a little too convenient. Worse is the awkward denouement, where Helen Mirren playing the middle-aged heroine Rachel Singer, travels to Ukraine and ends up getting herself done in by the Nazi antagonist, only to dispatch him at the last second (and in the nick of time). It's not that I disliked the whole idea of Singer paying off her debt to her country--it's just that I couldn't believe an aging, retired Mossad agent, would take it upon herself to 'finish the job' herself. It's good for the movies but even retired Mossad agents realize there are certain protocols involved in various intelligence missions and one doesn't 'go rogue', especially when one is pushing seventy.'The Debt' is generally well-acted but in the end, I just didn't care about the love triangle which forms the basis of a rather tedious sub-plot. There was also a lack of continuity between the actors who were playing the younger roles and the older ones depicted in the present day.Perhaps what the film scenarists were getting at is that actors in organizations such as the Mossad, which is generally thought of as pretty favorable in the west, are also fallible. The protagonist certainly redeems herself in the end by sacrificing her life but do we really care? The absurd romantic angle grows tedious and we never become truly invested in the antagonist, who lacks a back story and is more a caricature, than a fleshed out human being.</fullReview>

When she goes to the hospital to kill the Surgeon I thought she was going to inject the poison without even looking at his face. Why even suggest that she was considering this? And the way she was taking her time was ridiculous. And was it him or not? I couldn't even tell if it was the same guy that she fought in the bathroom. His clothes were different, but I'm assuming it was the same guy. I mean it had to be right? So she totally screwed up by not killing him right away then she screwed up again by telling the truth after he was dead. It just totally fell apart for me at the end.

		<shortDescription>A Class Act all the Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1965, a team of Mossad agents fail to bring back to Israel, Doctor Dieter Vogel (Christensen) the "Surgeon of Bierkenau" who did inhuman experiments on people including children. In 1997, these agents learn that Vogel is still alive when everyone in Israel believed he was dead. Now, these retired agents have to deal with making things right. So now we have Queen Elizabeth as an action hero? I almost didn't recognize her because she dyed her hair. (Again, you are confusing Helen Mirren with Queen Elizabeth) I had a feeling you would say it was that Mirren woman again. You sure? (positive) Hmmmm???Anyway, a terrific story, and thriller without too much CGI; and loads of suspense and tension as we see the details in flashbacks of the 1965 Vogel kidnapping. And, there is even more tension in 1997 when the plan is to take out this old man in a hospital who claims he is Vogel and about to talk to a reporter. Be prepared for a shock in the first 8-minutes or so. You won't believe the stunt, CGI or whatever. I spilled my drink as I have never seen anything like you will see. Never. Amazing how they did it. When I think of Helen Mirren, I also think of you-know-who (hmmm??..) but I never really think of her as a lead in a movie. The actress who played her character Rachel in the 1965 period was Jessica Chastain and she was terrific. Later when we get to 1997, Queen Elizabeth takes over. (You mean Helen Mirren as the older Rachel?) Yes, yes, of course, anyway she held her own going after the man claiming to be Vogel. But, truth be told this movie works because of the team in 1965: Stephan (Csokas), David (Worthington), Rachel (Chastain) and we cannot forget the good doctor Vogel (Christensen). These 4-actors worked so well together it was like I was eavesdropping. Those scenes were a class act all the way to tomorrow. And, the Oscar goes to: that's a tough one. They all deserve their own Oscar. But, you know the Queen will get it. (you need to let that go)You will see the moral dilemma that confronts the agents, then and now. And, when you finish seeing the movie, you can debate what you should have done, and would do now, had you been in those positions. This is as good a spy thriller as you will ever see. 10/10.Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes.</fullReview>

But, I was drawn into the movie and I got up only after completing the movie. In sum, it was a taut, gripping thriller.The story starts with the present day when the daughter of Ex Mossad agents is being honored for a book she has written on her parents capture of the dreaded 'butcher of Birkenau'. The third member of the team incidentally commits suicide the same day and then starts a series of back and forth events between times into the reality surrounding their past.The past which will come back to haunt them and puts their entire reputation at risk of being damaged.

		<shortDescription>Nazi Hunting Twisted Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Madden (Director of Shakespere In Love among other films) actually fares pretty well with this suspense thriller. There are some flaws in the history of the plot, but it appears from the screen credits that this is not based upon a true incident. As it is a fiction based story, history here doesn't matter. Technique does and this one is pretty classy as a drama on that score.There is a flash back sequence early in the movie which you are led to believe puts you ahead of the movie. Then, when the sequence is flashed into later in the movie you find out that what really happened didn't really happen. It sound confusing but Madden pulls it off so that the film plot is still easy to follow.The acting in the film including the multiple ages of the main characters is pulled off quite smoothly. The suspense and drama play pretty well too. The difference here between a good film and a great one is that the daughter who wrote the book about her mother never really has much of a developed character. It is kind of like her character is on the film cutting room floor. I can still understand the mother wanting to protect the daughter from the lie but I do not see what the consequences on the daughter would really be other than being embarrassed that her mom's lie is totally in her book.If there were more put into the daughters character, than the viewer might get totally pulled in. Without that, the film is still good, it is just not great. The rest of it is really quite compelling and watchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wasn't prepared . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just seen an exciting European thriller, Point Blank, I wasn't prepared to enjoy another the next day, but I did with The Debt, set in Israel, Germany, and Ukraine and based on the 2007 Israeli film. John Madden helms this complicated story about capturing a Nazi war criminal, doctor-butcher Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christiansen), to bring him to Israeli justice by efficiently inter-cutting between the '60's of the capture and the '90's of the return to the case.A trio of highly-trained Israeli Mossad agents is invincible until their captive creates enough dissent to escape. After that taut drama of the first hour, the film devolves into melodrama resulting from the mistakes the trio improbably made with the prisoner. "Mistakes" because two of them allow themselves to listen to the brilliant doctor and leave themselves open to his bolting; notwithstanding the captive unbelievably overpowers the robot-like fighter, Rachel ( Jessica Chastain), who allows herself to become involved in a triangle and become emotionally distraught too many times (unless their training does not include psychology).Even operative David (Sam Worthington) is guilty of letting the monster into his head, despite the fact that he had the strength to avoid entangling himself with Rachel. However, Stephan (Marton Csokas) has no trouble siring a child with Rachel. Only he has the cool of a top Israeli agent. The seeds, so to speak, of their failure, are sown in the triangle; the enduring torment is the lie they tell about shooting the escaping doctor, who actually vanished. Until 1997, that is, when the failure has a chance of being exposed.I dislike dwelling too much on plot, as I have here, but the strength of the thriller is the plot although the actors are first-rate, exemplified by the older Rachel (Helen Mirren), Stephan (Tom Wilkinson), and David (Ciaran Hinds) and the actors who play their younger selves. Director John Madden keeps it apace without allowing that pesky plot to get out of control.I found a theme despite the tense action: Tell the truth or a Nazi doctor will haunt you?well maybe not the business after the "or." The tension about keeping the lie going for the sake of Rachel's daughter, who has published a book about the heroic capture, and the pride of Israel is palpable, and believable enough to make the rest of us question what we would do in the same circumstance.I, for one, would choose not to get involved at all. My review is the truth s'all I'm sayin'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can hear it now, "You can't criticize a movie about the Holocaust." " If a movie is about the killing of innocent Jews, it has to be a masterpiece." "If a film is about Nazi hunters, you have to give it a high rating." I hear the same thing about any movie with an overtly gay theme. Actually, no it doesn't, and this film proves it. Even if you buy into the hocus pocus stupid story, this film does no tribute or justice to Jews who suffered under the Nazis. Actually, if you do buy into this story, you are left wondering how many other Jews lied or puffed their stories just to sound good. And, that cannot be a good thing. The fact is Hitler and the Nazis were so horrendous, who needs to hype any story? And, oh yeah, this movie was fairly boring.One of the worst things about this film was that it flashed back and forth so much I was flash shocked. Rachel Singer and two fellow Nazi hunters, David and Stephan set out to capture Dr. Dieter Vogel?the "infamous surgeon of Birkenau." Their secret agent mission is to capture him alive from East Berlin (1964) and return him to Israel for trial. The trouble with this movie is that the entire story from beginning to end is made up. So is the history. There was no Dr. Dieter Vogel. The story is loosely based upon the real-life Dr. Josef Mengele who allegedly did surgery for the purpose of torturing the prisoners at Birkenau. Why do even care about this story? It's not real history.It gets worse. Young Rachel (Chastain) grows up and thirty years later the older Rachel (Mirren) has a daughter who writes a book about how her mother captured and shot Dr.Vogel. It is mostly all a big lie as Vogel actually escaped and is now living in a psychiatric hospital. Rachel, David and Stephen have struggled their whole lives with the "real truth." The problem is no one cares if it was the truth or a big lie but them. The fact is they should have just killed this scumbag when they had the chance but they didn't. Instead they engaged in an exotic scheme to take him back to Israel for some big show trial. They failed. No one cares, not them, not the audience and not history. This is why the U.S. sent in Navy Seals to execute Osama Bin Laden. When you are that guilty, the best thing is to just kill a war criminal. Capturing Nazi war criminals alive just to put them on show trial and then execute them is just an exercise in nonsense.The movie does raise a compelling question. Does all history need to be set straight? Is everyone entitled to know "the truth?" Let me think about that for 1.3 seconds. The answer is an unequivocal "No." If some obscure Nazi devil was killed in war, killed by some revenge seekers or dies 40 years later drooling in a wet adult diaper in some obscure hospital, who cares? Every time I hear some estranged wife of a politician, some hooker to a famous actor, or some dictators ex-mistress declare that "people need to know the truth" I nearly puke. No, no we don't. And, in most cases, we don't even care what the truth is.I don't really care to know the real story behind Barry Bonds (of course he took steroids) or O.J. Simpson (of course he is a murderer) or what Pete Rose bet on, does it really matter? In 2011, Nazi war criminals are history. In 1964, Nazi war criminals that were left alive should have been hunted down and killed.Some good acting intervened. I cringed quite a bit. I was bored. I learned nothing. The End.</fullReview>

The director threw in a few suspenseful twists and turns. I would have reshot the airport scene with period correct cars, though.

Sure, the performances are all stellar (I'll go out on the limb and say the younger cast outperforms the older cast and Mirren and company are the ones getting all the praise) but the structure of the movie itself feels off and nothing ever hits the mark enough to enjoy or to be thrilled by any of the events depicted. The film really does fizzle out with an unsatisfying ending.These lines say it best: "We're supposed to be interested in the characters, but we're never really given a chance to know them, and when we're supposed to be engaged in the mission, they'd rather have us trying to focus on the relationships between the characters. If you were looking for a thrilling and immersing story of bravery based on the synopsis of the film, sadly you won't find it here."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Young actors and old make The Debt a taut thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a cast like this, how can this movie fail? Taut, tense, compelling, and a little bloody, The Debt tells the story of three Mossad agents who infiltrate East Germany in 1965 to capture an escaped Nazi doctor who experimented and killed hundreds at the Birkenau concentration camp during World War II. Their mission: snatch him and take him back to Israel for trial. The film opens in modern times as one the agents, Rachel Singer (Helen Mirren), is being honored for her work as chronicled by her daughter in a new book. Singer, we find out, shot and killed Doktor Bernhardt (Jesper Christensen in a sinister performance) as he tried to escape from his trio of captors. The other two, David (Ciaran Hinds) and Stephan (Tom Wilkinson), turn up, too. David has been absent for a long time, presumably sick as well. Stephan (not Steven but Steffan) is Singer's ex-husband and a major government official but now limited physically and confined to a wheelchair. Their relationship is not friendly but they share a daughter whose coming-out party as an author is a really big deal.Flash back to 1965 and we meet them decades earlier as they carry out their dangerous assignment. Lethal killers, the three (played by exceptional actors Jessica Chastain, Marton Csokas, and Avatar's Sam Worthington) are all business (well, almost). Their plan is precise. They have to get into East Germany, confirm the identity of the war criminal, drug him, bag him, take him across the border into the West, and get him back to Israel. The doctor, now practicing as a gynecologist (ooo!), sees Rachel as a patient, where she undergoes an exam, takes surreptitious pictures of the doctor to confirm his identity and to set him up. Her cohorts plan the escape. It comes off almost flawlessly but the plan goes awry just as they are ready to escape. The protagonists and their prey are stranded in an apartment in East Germany with no way out.While the film flashes forward and back, we find out more of the story, the secrets the trio have been keeping for all these years, and the back-story we missed. That leads us to Act III, the thrilling conclusion of this spy yarn. To tell you more would be giving the story away but, suffice it to say, this is where Helen Mirren shines as always. Now well into her 60s, Mirren remains at the top of her game and, arguably, gets the best parts for older women, including Meryl Streep. She has been in action films, comedies, and heavy dramas. Wilkinson's role is quite limited and Hinds has little more than a cameo but makes the most of it. The real stars are the younger actors, all of whom are truly fantastic here.The accents these British, Kiwi, and American actors (of the principals, only Chastain is American) assume represent my only problem with the film. Presumably, they are playing Israelis, whose English accent is very distinctive. These six actors seem to have six different accents with Wilkinson having the least authentic. Of course, some of them have to speak German, too. And Mirren even has to speak Russian (which she did in White Nights). But this is quibbling. Filmed in Hungary and Israel, The Debt is the thriller of the year so far. I really liked it. Don't let the warnings of the few violent scenes keep you away. They weren't that bad but they kept my wife away from the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Because I live in Paris, I got to see this film long before its scheduled release date in the USA. It is really quite well done, and especially the two Rachels are both excellent (one the superb Helen Mirren, the other a virtual unknown, but great). However, for me, the acting kudos belong to the Dane who plays the Butcher or Birkenau. Apparently he's been in lots of films, but doesn't usually make a strong impression. Here he most certainly does, and conveys charm and creepiness together in a most convincing way. It's a fairly large role, and he really pulls it off in a way that actually makes you loathe him by the end. There are no bad performances here, but this one is outstanding. I want to add that I had no idea that Jessica Chastain (young Rachel) was the same actress as Mrs O'Brien in Tree of Life. Of course they look alike, but the characters are so different, almost opposite, that it didn't cross my mind. It shows she has diversity among her talents, in addition to her indubitable beauty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE DEBT is the current version of HA HOV written by Ido Rubenblum and writer/director Assaf Bernstein: their story and screen play were the nidus for the current version which was revised and written by Matthew Vaughn, Jane Goldman Porter and directed by John Madden.The film opens at a gala party in Israel where Rachel Brenner (Helen Mirren) is being honored again for her role in ending the life of the infamous 'surgeon of Birkenau' who during WW II did heinous experiments on human beings in the camps of Birkinau, including being responsible for the death of Rachel's mother. But news arrives that at all old folks home in the Ukraine that the surgeon is still alive. We learn that the now retired Mossad secret agents Rachel (Helen Mirren) and Stefan (Tom Wilkinson) about their former colleague David (Ciarán Hinds) need an explanation. Flash back to 1966 when the trio of three Mossad agents (Rachel - played at the young age by Jessica Chastain, Stephan Gold (Marton Csokas)and David Peretz (Sam Worthington) were sent to capture the surgeon (Jesper Christensen) and erroneously allowed him to escape and promised each other to keep their secret, told the papers that he committed suicide. Rachel, Stefan and David decide they must complete their broken mission and go to the Ukraine, fine the surgeon and kill him. Stephan and David are not up to the task, so it is left to Rachel to finish their mission. The suspenseful hunt and chase is how the mission is accomplished. The manner in which the film is set into motion is a seamless interchange of the years 1944 during the war and the black and white images of the concentration camps, and 1965 when the three young Mossad agents captured the surgeon (and their interaction with him before his escape) and the present when the now 60ish Rachel carries out her duty. It is chilling, rich in character development, and maintains a degree of tension that is almost unbearable at times. But the other aspect of this film that keeps it form being yet another memoir of the mistreatment of the Jews in WW II is the element of humanity in each of the three Mossad agents as they deal with their task and yet interact with the evil and warped surgeon. This is a very strong film, one that deserves audience attention. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Political film - great discussion topics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Keep in mind this is a movie, not a documentary about the Mossad and its procedures. As a movie, it takes certain liberties with reality. that said, its a great movie, a great political film because it brings up many deep themes: can we believe our great government myths? do governments hide the truth from citizens in order to promote civic values and core beliefs? What untruths, or outright lies, form the basis for the careers of our government leaders? The film took too much time on the kidnapping of the Nazi doctor, and too little time about the impact the secret of the agents had on their lives, and careers. the ending was short, hard to believe, but probably edited heavily after filming to make the film come in at about 2 hrs, the usual max time for a film. all in all, a good film with some great discussion topics. Definitely a film to show in a college political film class.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent thriller, but that's just a cover for a drama about people's secrets and anguish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good movie. I did find some minor annoyances though. First, the secret (and thus the debt) the characters kept was of acts they committed 20 years before that were not mere "mistakes." Not "Oopsie! My bad." Rather, the secret they kept was of cowardice and selfishness of an order that bordered on treason.Second, the characters had some stupidity beyond typical character weaknesses- they oddly were derelict in letting their own personalities get in the way of fulfilling their mission in the first place. I found it hard to believe real life Mosad agents would have been that dumb. This is not supposed to be an historically accurate drama, of course. But the film maker must take some criticism for creating characters with such sloppy ethics and flabby "spine."This is a thriller in the tradition of some of those Soviet-era spy movies of the late 60s and 1970s. That aspect was well done. To me, anyway, the dreary and crappy doctor's clinic and street scenes of what was supposed to be East Berlin felt real (was Hungary and UK studios though). I have no way of knowing, of course- its look just fit my imagination of the real time and place.Beyond being a thriller, though, this was really about the motives of the people involved. That may sound glib in a movie comment, but seriously, the entire theme of the film was always more about the secrets the former Mosad agents carried. As the plot unraveled and revealed for us what those secrets were, and what that might have meant to the characters, we were presented with a clear case that it was the process of keeping a secret, and the cost, and the attempt to redeem oneself in the face of the secrets that was the real movie story. the thriller story merely gave us an excuse, an occasion, to glimpse inside the hearts and minds of people in anguish.Not a cheerful movie, of course- but not overly grim, either. Very well cast, very well acted. Helen Mirren was astounding! The English guy who played the young Israeli, David, resembled a very young Liev Schreiber.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Munich vibe with some storytelling ? la Atonement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd give a 7.5 if I had the option, and I toyed with the idea of an 8. I decided to allow a cushion with the respect to the fact that I was VERY excited about the advance screening.We're talking about a film that's rich and intricate enough that you'll want to watch it a second time immediately after seeing the resolution, to see what nuances you missed the first time.It's hard not to like a flick about the post-WWII desire to exact revenge on an ungodly Mengele-like Nazi "surgeon." I mention Atonement with respect to narrative qualities you will later understand and, I believe, greatly appreciate--not to imply an oversaturation of romance. The Debt has something more like a 6.5-level focus (out of 10) on the love story scale, as compared to where I would place Atonement at about an 8. I, for one, appreciated this greatly. Now add an espionage factor of about 9, an action factor of about 7.5, and Helen Mirren--and we have a winner.In taking the espionage focus in a film, there comes that considerable degree of exploration of the psychological baggage that comes with such a lifestyle, both during and after. The overall intrigue provided by some additional psychological scarring should seal the deal for just about anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spy Thriller with superb acting by Helen Mirren</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I just seen the spy movie masterpiece The Debt with Helen Mirren and it was fantastic. The story line is three Mossad agents Rachel, Stefan, and David are sent on a mission in 1966 to capture a Nazi war criminal. Fast forward 30 years and these agents are heralded for completing their mission. Rachel and Stefan receive new information from David and know have to decide on how to deal with the information. This information can change their lives forever. The movie is filled with lots of action and drama that will pull you in and keep you captivated. The story unfolds in a non-linear order which just adds to the mystique of the film. The use of the desaturated colors in East Germany nailed the scene dead on. From a technical standpoint, it was near flawless. My motive for seeing the film was Helen Mirren. I am a huge fan. Helen Mirren's character is Rachel. Just as in a lot of her roles, Helens character comes off as strong, determined, assertive yet not completely cold and a bit shut off. It is just a superb performance. I am a big Helen Mirren fan. If you are looking for drama, intrigue, action, and a suspenseful thriller, go see this movie..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvelously Acted, and Tightly Directed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few movies are as perfectly cast as The Debt. It's just unreal how believable it is that Jessica Chastain is a young Helen Mirren, that Sam Worthington is a young Ciaran Hinds, and that Marton Csokas is a young Tom Wilkinson.The Debt is a movie that takes place primarily in the past, as the older counterparts of three Israeli Mossad agents reflect on their secret mission in the early '60s trying to apprehend the Nazi Surgeon of Birkenau for war crimes committed against the Jewish nation. Majority of the action transpires in the past, while majority of the present is purely the characters reflecting on what happened when they were young. Seeing why these characters are reflecting (via flashbacks) is more satisfying than the moments where their older counterparts are simply reflecting, but the two wind up complimenting one another and forming a complete whole in the end, and the climax with the older Helen Mirren is as suspenseful as any of the moments with the young Jessica Chastain.While Israeli accents often slip amongst the actors, in particular Sam Worthington, the performances of the cast are pure and emotionally authentic, while director John Madden infuses the scenes of the past with so much raw tension that The Debt often rivals Hitchcock classics, and then the scenes in the present are so marvelously played by the older actors conveying so much with simple looks. There is a richness to character in The Debt beyond the usual thrills of a thriller like this, and it is what makes The Debt so special and enjoyable. Even if the present is less exciting to watch than the past, the two work in tandem, with the past delivering the thrills and the present the emotion of the events. I give The Debt a 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intense movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot twist is obvious. Yet it's still an excellent movie because of the great acting and the theme of trying to bring a war criminal to justice. That the mission fails is not the point; it dramatizes to what lengths people are willing to go to do the right thing, even against all odds. A Nazi war criminal believes that he has avoided justice but is found out. He is tracked down and apprehended, but then the plan comes apart. It's a covert operation, so there is no back up. The Nazi escapes but then is rediscovered years later. In the meantime, the agents concoct an elaborate cover up story, and if the truth is ever discovered, the results could be disastrous, since the mission has already been transformed into legend. This movie deals with the question of when does expediency trump the truth? For this reason, this is an intense movie which grabs and keeps the audience's attention and is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nazi hunting usually makes for an exciting movie. This one jumps from the mission to a more current period with a flash back that feels suspicious. It seems to give too much information. The movie still holds your interest.Helen Mirren gives her usual excellent performance, although she goes in and out of accents at times. Jessica Chastain shines and does the heavy lifting as the young Mirren character. Other then the Nazi, the men are flat and not very interesting. The mission impossible aspect of the film works well until the mission gets botched. The prisoner in the apartment gets a bit talky. The end sequence with Mirren in Russia seems too unbelievable.Worth your time and money. The film works as there is plenty of audience reaction. Good to hear the cheers at the appropriate time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Political Thriller Regarding the Next Generation After the Holocaust</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We often think of 1945 as the end of World War II, and the arrival of Allied troops into Berlin as the death-knell of Nazi-controlled Germany. However, some of the story continues, granted on a much smaller scale, such as the manhunts for people suspected of war crimes like Adolf Eichmann, and the recovery of stolen artwork and artifacts. Much of the atrocities at the hand of the Nazis before and during World War II still linger and affect people today, more than 65 years ago at this writing. "The Debt" is a partially fictitious story about how the events of the 1930's and 1940's still carries on today. The story which begins about 20 years after the war doesn't end until 1997.The film begins in 1997 with the publication of a book about three young Israelis 30 years earlier in the service of Mossad in the mid-1960's. The book has been written by the young daughter of one of the agents, the mother now in her 50s. Although this is supposed to be a joyous occasion, the mother appears ambivalent about the whole affair, which is one of the keys to understanding this film. Mossad is the Israeli equivalent of the CIA, and the three agents were engaged in a manhunt for Dr Vogel, the so-called "Surgeon of Birkenau", who tortured victims in medical experiments during the Nazi regime in Germany. Although Dr Vogel appears to be a fictional character, I would guess he is largely based on the real-life Dr Joseph Mengele, who engaged in horrible medical experiments at the death camps at the behest of the Third Reich. The three Mossad agents, Rachel Singer, Stephan Gold, and David Peretz, have vowed to kidnap Vogel whom they believe is practicing gynecology in East Berlin under communist occupation and extradite him to Israel to face trial, similar to the fate of Adolf Eichmann only a few years earlier. Vogel, if based on Mengele, would be in his mid-50's in 1965.The film then flashes back to 1965 when two of the three agents, Rachel and David, pass through "Check-Point Charlie", the crossing station separating East and West Berlin from 1961 until 1990. Now in East Berlin, they meet up with Gold to resolve to kidnap the doctor. Their mission has three components. They must verify their subject as being the Nazi doctor, they must figure out a way to kidnap him, and lastly, the three with their prisoner must escape back into West Berlin under the nose of East Berlin guards. During this time, people caught trying to escape to the West from the East could be either imprisoned or shot. Presumably, once in West Berlin, they will be met by other members of the Mossad who will take Vogel back to Israel and force him to stand trial for war crimes and murder.Interspersed between the events of 1965-1966 are the events of 31 years later in 1997. Two of the three original agents, Rachel Singer, played by Helen Mirren, and Stefan Gold, played by Tom Wilkinson, are finding that the past has caught up with them, and they must deal with the events of three decades earlier. Singer's daughter has written a book about these young agent's experiences in the 1960's, but as events unfold, it may turn out that not all the events as written are completely accurate.An outstanding and mesmerizing tale of suspense and political intrigue, one of the best I have seen in recent years. The three younger actors, Jessica Chastain, Marton Csokas, and Sam Worthington play the younger versions of the agents, are really at the heart of the film and deserve as much credit as their older counterparts. As a pure action-suspense thriller, it can't be beat. As a political statement about the horrors of the holocaust, its one of the most compelling I've seen in such an offering in quite a few years. Just be warned that this is not escapist's fair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Debt" brims with intensity and works once it all comes together</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best spies usually work alone. There's a reason James Bond and Jason Bourne fly solo, which is generally assumed to be that it lessens the margin for error and prevents emotional attachments. Perhaps it's really because the we like to uncover the dark secrets that make a ruthless assassins tick, which isn't too much of a challenge to a screenwriter ? when there's only one spy. In "The Debt," we have three former Israeli Mossad agents who were hailed as heroes in 1966 after salvaging a near-lost mission to capture a Nazi war criminal in East Berlin and bring him to trial in Israel. That makes for three heads we yearn to crack, not to mention the consequent relationship tension resulting from a little something we don't yet know. For a plot that has a lot of stories to juggle (individual character stories on top of the rehashing of the events in East Berlin), "The Debt" rests in good hands. Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman have written some excellent scripts in "Kick-Ass" and "X-Men: First Class," and despite the various challenges and a few painfully slow moments (some of which you could argue had a point to being that way), they and Peter Straughan manage a narrative with evenly spread tension points. No doubt much of that credit belongs to veteran director John Madden. Every scene packs an unspoken element of tension whether pure suspense, inner monologue or even romantic tension.Rachel, Stephan and David were all agents on the mission that resulted in the death of "The Surgeon of Birkenau." In 1997, Rachel (Helen Mirren) and Stephan's (Tom Wilkinson) daughter Sarah has published a book of their heroism, but that very day, David (Ciarán Hinds) commits suicide. Immediately we come to realize something's amiss and from there the film tells of the events in East Berlin.For the most part, this is Rachel's story. In 1966 East Berlin she's played by Jessica Chastain, who takes advantage of the amount of screen time and steals the show. If there's a right way to communicate what it's like to be spying on an infamous Nazi surgeon who performed horrific experiments while having him examine you in stirrups on multiple occasions, she found it.Rachel is also at the center of an understated love triangle that feels a bit heavy-handed when it rises to the foreground. Nevertheless, the actors do well with what they're given. Romance aside, Marton Csokas gives young Stephan the Type-A personality he requires while Worthington meddles in the shadows as a more introverted young David. Worthington shows he's far better suited for more external characters, but to be fair the only truly bad thing about his performance is his Israeli accent. In fact, the accent thing across the board was kind of rough.When the three finally capture the infamous Dieter Vogel, the film moves in an odd direction. The script gives the doctor too many chances to open his mouth and say obnoxious and horribly anti-Semitic things, all of which seem to waste time and just make the audience and the characters angry ? a dangerous emotion at the movies. If not for leading up to a seriously effective reveal/twist, it would have marred the entire film. Instead, the story continues another half hour longer than expected with a slow but mostly pertinent dragging out of the conclusion and the film's thematic questions. Undoubtedly, some viewers will find the script's anger-inducing elements drive them beyond the point of enjoyment, though by the end the filmmakers justify everything."The Debt" asks some questions of those we call heroes and effectively examines the importance of truth, but the road there requires bounding over some romantic obstacles and some serious junctures where the point almost feels entirely lost. The more we know about the story, the clearer the picture comes together, but it takes awhile to arrive there. Like a good puzzle, the most satisfying thrillers come together at an even grind with a couple bumps and twists. "The Debt" compares more to the kind that comes together all at once after much laboring when you finally uncover the key that justifies it all. Both end satisfactorily, but the latter makes you wonder if it was worth it for the moments of great frustration.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Spy Flick, that dragged on just a little too much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a summer where the movies have been filled with action hero movies, crude humor comedies, and predictable romantic comedies, one film has shown promise of breaking the mold. For the last three months, trailers for The Debt have shown promise of a decent spy film returning to the theaters, hopefully bringing some well-developed drama to the table. Now that the film has finally arrived, I paid a visit to the Alamo Theater to see if the film delivered. Read on to find out my thoughts.For those who haven't seen the trailer, the Debt is about three secret agents Rachel (Helen Mirren), Stephan (Tom Wilkinson), and David (Ciarán Hinds) as they tell the story of their mission in Berlin. The movie is filmed as a series of flashback where their younger counterparts, played by Jessica Chastain, Marton Csokas, and Sam Worthington respectively, act out the mission to find Doktor Bernhardt (Jesper Christensen). As the mission continues to play out, the spies' psychological profiles soon are challenged by the mad doctor. Thirty years later, the audience gets to see the results of the mission and what their decisions have rewarded them with.For once I am happy to say that the trailer was representative of the movie. The only thing that was different from my trailer interpretation was that the mission was the two worlds were not as integrated as I had expected. The first fifteen minutes of the movie provide a quick introduction into the modern life and introduce some unanswered questions that immediately pull the audience into the film. The next hour then focuses on the past, as the younger counterparts enter Berlin and go on the hunt for the mad doctor. Here is where I will say that the cast and crew of this movie did a fantastic job creating a covert mission. Unlike some of the other spy films we have seen, The Debt trades explosions, car chases, and gun fights for a more realistic take on being a secret agent. The planning, the practice, and the commitment to their fake lives are incredibly believable and one can't help, but get roped in to the character. The pace of the mission is still pretty fast and the clever spy maneuvers are executed at just the right times to keep one into the film.Eventually though we fall into the drama of the film as complications to the original plan begin to take their toll on the characters. As their psyches begin to wear down, the background of the characters begins to develop and their morals and characters are soon revealed. Here the pace of the movie slows down considerably as the drama soon turns into a dragged out sequence of repetitive shots that wear thin on one's patience. Yes there is a lot of great information, and the well written dialog is delivered brilliantly to add an extra emotional layer to the film. However, I eventually grew bored of the repetitive information and began wondering how long it would be until the movie either ended or moved on. Eventually the twist to the plot came, surprising me in the process, and soon brought Mirren and company back into the picture. Here the answers to the question I had throughout the movie are revealed, and the pace picks up once more. Mirren for the most part drives the rest of the movie and fans of the actress will be drawn into the last twenty minutes of the film in deep suspense.My main problems with this film center on the pace of the film. Although the mission was exciting and suspense filled, the dramatic change in pace during the second half of the flashback really bored me. The constant repetition of the information, and the constant dwelling on certain events grew annoying with each passing mission. Fans may also be disappointed in the fact that the movie focuses primarily on Rachel's story, which wasn't a big issue for me. The ending as well was a little dragged out for me and there were a few times I was ready for the film to be over with, despite me being a big Helen Mirren fan.Overall The Debt is a solid spy film with a lot of great character development thrown into the mix. The superb cast, quality acting, intriguing questions, and suspense spy actions are all nicely integrated into this movie. Unfortunately the dragged out plot and slow pace during some parts of the movie are weaknesses the cast should have worked on, as well as better balancing in the elderly actors. My review for this film is a somewhere between a 7.0-7.5, and recommend this film to anyone looking for great character development. Check back next time for my reviews on Apollo 18 and Shark Attack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Debt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Debt is a remake of the 2007 film of the same name which was done in Israel and was written by Assaf Bernstein and Ido Rosenblum. The film takes place in 1997 and also goes back to the mid 1960's for a good part of the film. The film at the beginning introduces us to Rachel Singer who is currently in Germany on a mission. Rachel's job is as a Mossad agent. For those unfamiliar a Mossad agent is the national intelligence agency of Israel and their jobs are to do intelligence collection as well as covert operations which include targeted and assigned killings and working with the military doing activities beyond Israel's borders. While in Germany, Rachel stays with two young men who are both on the same mission. Their names are David and Stefan. While they go about their next mission, complications arise and it will prove to be a problem for them right up until their adulthood which leaves these agents with feelings of determination to finish the mission that went wrong and clean up this debt that has haunted their personal lives and to erase all the lies they have told to protect themselves to clear it up. The film moves from the events with a young Rachel in the 1960's to a much older Rachel in 1997 and as I said above her and some others still plan to complete the mission and this supposed "debt" that has plagued both their careers and personal lives for years. I am sorry if all this sounds brief, but if I was to give anything else away it would certainly spoil the movie and that is the last thing I want to do. The Debt was originally slated for a December 2010 release, but was then pushed back to late August 2011 for a release. Usually films that do get such a delay as that and films that are released on the Labour Day weekend usually suggest one thing and that is that the film in question is terrible and that is why it was delayed because the distributor did not know what to do with it and for whatever reason, studios tend to release some of their worst films over the Labour Day weekend. Why? I do not know. Luckily for me, The Debt was such a fantastic film that it broke the usual curse that comes to a delayed film and one released over the Labour Day weekend. The Debt is a very involving film and certainly captures one's interest. I also like how it was a personal film and felt personal. I have probably said before in other reviews that when doing a film like this that deals with a sensitive issue, it is better to make it more of a personal film in which there are reflections of the characters, good character study and just a good sense of development where you can easily empathize with the characters and what they are going through and the feelings do not feel forced or fake. The Debt does it the right way in that regard. I also like how it is a smaller film and not some big budget Hollywood movie that will sensationalize everything and take away the personal part of it that makes it such a joy and at times a little difficult to relate to the characters and their experiences, but in this film that whole aspect is rather quite rewarding. The film moves at a great pace and kept my interest the whole time. The performances were all terrific, but I especially have to single out Jessica Chastain, who plays the young Rachel. With her facial expressions, body language and subtle way of acting and also at the same time being able to display so many different feelings of emotions, I think she gives an Oscar worthy performance and I think her career is heading in the right way for this young, but very talented actress. I also liked how the film was not predictable and didn't follow any formulas or clichés and it felt gritty and real to me. I like how the film looked and felt gritty because the surroundings felt all the more real and authentic because of that and I could really appreciate that. I have never seen the original 2007 film that this one is based on, or a remake of, so I have just been reviewing my initial reaction to this new version I saw. I feel the film has a lot of power and emotion and is likely to get us to feel fear at times as well as sadness and empathy for the characters. There is also an underlying story of regrets in the past and opportunities one missed and can never achieve, or partake of again and that was a really interesting aspect as well. The Debt is entertaining and powerful and is wonderfully made and with a great cast. It gets you thinking and will stay with you long after you leave the theatre. The signs of a great film and one of the best of the year in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old new Israel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Travel in past. A new old Israel and its ghosts, mysteries and a hansom agent. A kind of Da Vinci code, soft, nice and with some drops of tension. Herzl and his shadow. A son and a dark legacy. A notebook and the lost life of a young girl. Nostalgics and Secret Services. Pieces of a thriller. Nothing new, in fact. Superficial, like any East story in the eyes of an American, half -truth and classic recipes. Victory of good guy and the failure of evil. But interesting in that case are the roots. Israel is a mystery, part of its history and Kishinev's land. His dreams are fruits of an one era. The leaders are masks of a single Master. The present is more small for the desire to be a Power.And the time - a notebook of a young girl lost in an era's memory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>mission impossible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the movie. It reminded of the television series "Mission Impossible". I enjoyed the ending. Three people and 3 different opinions on how to handle a crisis and ha, ha a mid-life crisis as well. The love interests between these 3 people is very interesting. The fighting of Helen Merrin's young character is astounding reminds of the Avengers. Don't look at the New York Times review they think it's so-so. The writing is good and so are the 6 primary actors. It's all filmed on location. Lots of hints as toward the ending portion. I spoke to some of the other viewers, people my age are wimps and wanted to walk out. It's truly about three people going through a MID LIFE CRISIS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Debt proves that 2 parallel time lines are hard to conquer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directors have to be careful not to insult their audience's intelligence by running a lengthy part of a story twice with the intention of us understanding well what the movie is about. It has also been proved that gory violent details are usually not needed to tell a violent story well.At this time of year many movies come out with experienced actors that, were not for their professionalism and exquisite craft of their characters, would be considered too old to play any part, so we are lucky we have an awards season and the true masters are still necessary.The actors in this film do not need to prove they can act. And their performances attest to the fact. It is a shame that the story, which was evidently a good one, was told poorly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Debt was jaw dropping!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie, The Debt, was a very good movie. It was the kind of movie that you are on the edge of your seat the entire time! I was very surprised what the movie was about, because the trailer really doesn't tell you much about the movie. There were some amazing performances, by Sam Worthington, Jessica Chastain, Hellen Mirren, and Marton Csokas. Sam Worthington played young David, and I thought that he did a very well done performance. You've seen him in Avatar, Clash of the Titans, but none of them compare to the wonderful time i had seeing him play young David. Hellen Mirren played the older Rachel, and Jessica Chastain played the younger Rachel. They both did captivating performances!! All in all you NEED to see this movie, The Debt!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why on earth is Budapest getting sold as Berlin?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was shot almost entirely in my home town Budapest, Hungary ? obviously for budget considerations and maybe because Budapest is just as rundown as Berlin was 40 or 50 years ago. I know we Budapest residents represent a minority that's totally insignificant and most of the audience can't even make a difference, especially outside of Europe. But in terms of architecture and overall atmosphere, the two cities are as different as they can be. Budapest doesn't even remotely resembles Berlin ? or very remotely at best.Without reviewing the actual movie, i must say this is a major turn off factor that makes it almost impossible for me to enjoy the movie. This trend of selling Budapest to the audience as cold war era Berlin was set by such movies as Spy Game and Munich, and is now continued by The Debt. Hollywood should just abandon this lunatic idea. It's nothing but a cheap gimmick.I gave it a 2 and i was overly generous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Values lesson,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heroic. Impresive. Subtle. Product of Israeli industry who, between Hollywood and Bolywood makes beautiful and good movies. The Debt is same legend with same pieces like many other films. The difference is the courage to define an era. And its heart - a spectacular man. Love, hate, survey, fights and wars , beauty and feelings are present but it is not a another play about old ages. May be propaganda. In small measure. In fact, it is a lesson. Yes, a history lesson but a values lesson and more that. A fresco but , in same time, a mirror. A speech about a roots time but a seductive way to define a nation.It is strange to say anything about a kind of movie. But it is nice to discover it with each word - skin of its images.</fullReview>
