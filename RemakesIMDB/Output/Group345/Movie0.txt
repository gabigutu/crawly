		<fullReview>This, the French La Femme Nikita, directed by Luc Besson, is one of the strangest, most bizarre, yet psychologically truest movies ever made. The story on the surface is absurd and something you'd expect from a grade 'B' international intrigue thriller. Anne Parillaud plays Nikita, a bitter, drug-dependent, unsocialized child of the streets who is faster than a kung fu fighter and packs more punch than a Mike Tyson bite. She's killed some people and is given a choice between death and becoming an assassin for the French government.This premise should lead to the usual action/adventure yarn, with lots of fists flying, guns going off, people jumping off of buildings, roaring through the streets in souped up vehicles, spraying bullets, etc., as blood flows and bones shatter. And something like that does happen. However there is a second level in which Nitika becomes the embodiment of something beyond an action adventure heroine. She is coerced and managed by society. Her individuality is beaten out of her so that she can be molded into what the society demands. She comes out of her 'training' with her individuality compromised, her free and natural spirit cowed, but undefeated and alive, and she sets out to do what she has been taught to do. And then she falls in love. And she notices, somewhere along the way, amid the murder and the mayhem, that there is something better than and more important than, and closer to her soul in this world than killing and being killed. She finds that she prefers love to hate, tenderness to brutality. She sees herself and who she is for the first time, but it is too late. She cannot escape. Or can she?Parillaud brings a wild animal persona tinged with beauty and unself-conscious grace to the role of Nikita. Marc Duret plays Rico, the tender man she loves, and Tchéky Karyo is her mentor, Bob, whom she also loves. Jeanne Moreau, the legend, has a small part as Amande, who teaches Nikita lipstick application and how to be attractive.Now compare this to the US remake called Point of No Return (1993), starring Bridget Fonda. (Please, do not even consider the vapid TV Nikita.) What's the difference? Well, Fonda's flashier, I suppose, but nowhere is there anything like the psychological depth and raw animal magnetism found in the original. The Fonda vehicle is simply a one-dimensional action flick stylishly done in a predictable manner. Besson's Nikita is a work of art that explores the human predicament and even suggests something close to salvation.As always with a French film, get the subtitled version. The dubbing is always atrocious, and anyway there's really not that much dialogue.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<shortDescription>This film is cooler than a fortnight in Antartica wearing a bikini, drinking chilled vodka with ice-packs strapped to your body.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget the awful series. Forget the even worse Hollywood remake 'The Assassin'. Remember Luc Besson's La Femme Nikita.This has got to be one of the most stylish, moody and gripping films in existence. Luc Besson's direction is refreshing whilst the cinematography is simply stunning, particuarly the scene in the hotel where Nikita gets her first assignment. The soundtrack by Eric Serra is simply genius and actually adds something to the film...soundtracks usually seem to be an afterthought but refreshingly; not in this case.The beautiful Anne Parillaud is perfect in the lead role (unlike Bridget Fonda) and the subtle romance between her and Tcheky Karyo is pure eloquence. The hugely talented Jean-Hughes Anglade (of Betty Blue fame) shines in this film but of all the male roles, Jean Reno (also fabulous in Luc Besson's Leon)is outstanding as the completely unbalanced Victor The Cleaner. Jeanne Moreau as Amande makes a notable appearence following years of contributions in countless films.Luc Besson established himself as one of the leading innovative directors with this film and you can easily see why. This movie certainly rates among the top 10 films of all time.I could pontificate about this film all day and all night but the best thing is for you to watch it yourself as a matter of priority...it is a 'must see'.I'm off now to pursue a career in international assassinations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anne Parillaud is phenomenal as a terrifyingly vulnerable, beautiful and human young anti-hero with an incredible talent for violence. A drug-addict murderous teen is given a second chance by a government agency looking to exploit her penchant for conscience-less killing. Mentored by a man whose compassion for her is only matched by his ambition and Machiavellian sadism, Nikita ventures on a roller-coaster ride leading a double-life as assassin and clean-living young woman in love. Her passionate affair with Marco and the clarity of her un-drugged consciousness, combine to promote the development of a conscience - a dangerous thing in her line of work. Nikita is, nevertheless, a victim of her circumstances, and like the rest of the characters on both sides, seems stuck in a very bad situation. In addition to the artistry with which this story is told, this film has a very nihilistic sense of justice and not-so-subtly points out the fact that state authorized murder is still murder. Jean Reno fans will enjoy his brief typecast cameo as "the cleaner".This is one of the best, if not the best, of Besson's films. It is extremely well paced, starkly and beautifully shot, and features some of the best acting and writing of the entire action genre. The script is just a little better in French than English. Nikita does not have the feel of an action film, but rather, feels like a fatalistic drama riddled with almost continuous tragedy and heartbreak, and spiced with just a tad of hope. Parillaud's multi-layered and complex construction of her character is so mesmerizing that it is frankly difficult to think of anything else while attempting to reflect on this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Parillaud Is THE Nikita</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1989 French film was justifiably so popular that an American re-make followed later and then a cable television series followed after that. In this - the original - you see "Nikita" at its beginning and, most people agree, at her best. Anne Parillaud, an actress I've always found fascinating, is riveting as the lead character. Jean-Huges Anglade, Tcheky Karyo and Jean Reno provide a very strong supporting cast.The characters were believable and it was refreshing to see a no-nonsense approach to a murder story, meaning if someone had to be killed, they were shot quickly with no questions asked. Some of the action scenes are brutal.Parillaud's character is memorable. She can change appearances, from a hard- nosed hysterical animal to a real lady. It's also interesting to see Reno in a familiar role as a "cleaner," a role he made famous four years later in "Leon: The Professional." The DVD provides either easy-to-read subtitles or a well-done dubbed version. If sound is important to you, you'll hear better stereo with the subtitled version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Welcome to the world where a woman can handle a gun and be as merciless and seemingly unemotional as any man. The anti- heroine, a woman named Nikita (Anne Parillaud in a performance of her life) is given a reprieve from a death sentence by government agents that want to use her as an undercover assassin. Stylish, ultraviolent, cynical but strangely engrossing - this is a must see for the fans of clever action movies.Director Luc Besson somehow manages to keep a high level of energy and our interest - from the opening scene ? a violent drugstore shootout until the very last moment. Terrific cast include also Jean-Hughes Anglade (Queen Margot, Killing Zoe), Tcheky Karyo (Kiss of the Dragon, Addicted to Love 1997), Jeanne Moreau - the legend of the French cinema ("Jules and Jim", "Elevator to the Gallows", "Going Places"), and Jean Reno ("Leon", "Ronin") Don't bother with the American remake (Bridgett Fonda) or TV series with the same title - see only original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I fell in love with this film from the moment I first saw a brief clip of it on an entertainment program. At first I was drawn to the action elements (being young and somewhat immature in my dramatic tastes), but I was blown away by the romance and character interplay. I loved the composition of the scenes, the noirish lighting, and the quirky humor. This movie, along with Pedro Almodovar's films, really opened my eyes to European films, particularly those with a signature style.The performances are great across the board. Anne Parillaud plays all facets of Nikita well, from her rebellious, drug-hazed beginning, to her growing confidence, and her near breakdown as her mission falls apart. Tcheky Karyo made a huge impression, mostly through his body language and his eyes. He says more with an expression than most actors do with dialogue. Jeanne Moraeu is a treasure, a truly beautiful woman in appearance and spirit. Jean-Hughues Anglade has the harder part, the "normal" guy who Nikita falls for. He is adept at comedy, but is tender in the love scenes. He carries himself well in his face-off with Bob. Finally, the actor who really stands out in memory, Jean Reno. Reno oozes charisma and talent, even in bad films. He steals the film the moment he enters.Luc Besson is a tremendous stylist. His films are beautiful, even when the story is a bit obtuse. He is adept at using light to portray and enhance emotion and his compositions are stunning. His main fault is that he lets style overtake story, but he gets away with it because the style is always interesting. He is a fine writer, although more care seems to go into the scripts he directs than those he has written for others.Finally, one can't discuss the films of Besson without discussing the music of Eric Serra. Serra creates an atmosphere that is much a part of the setting as the lighting or set decoration. His compositions convey mood and emotion, adding another layer to the story. His signature bass and percussion gets your heart pumping during action sequences, while the melodies bring a softness to intimate moments. He demonstrates the proper way to use synthesizers, to transform the music, rather than make up for lack of an orchestra (or talent). Serra's soundtracks were the first that I bought for instrumental music, rather than for pop songs used in the film. This is a film that appeals to many audiences. There is plenty of action and intrigue for thrillseekers, unique character studies, quirky humor, and above all, romance. It has spawned many imitations (Point of No Return, Black Cat, Nikita TV series) but has never been equaled. If you are a fan of film noir, action/espionage, character drama, or romance, you should see this film; then you should own this film. You'll want to watch it again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>plenty of verve and style, and a (rightfully) perennial favorite of French spy thrillers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luc Besson was on a hot streak in the late 80s/early 90s, and La Femme Nikita (or just Nikita for short) is almost as good as he got at putting his own distinctive stamp on a genre that many auteurs have trouble molding. The spy thriller is great for blockbuster audiences, but to make it into a strong romantic drama is always tricky, as there's the chance for too much one-dimensional theatrics or more attention paid to the plot convolutions than actual human emotions. Nikita squares this problem away just with the protagonist: a young punk (Anne Parillaud, in her most recognizable, near star-making performance) who kills a cop in the midst of a shoot-out is sentenced to life, but then sort of resurrected following the lead of a member of a covert spy organization, and given an ultimatum: become a spy/assassin, or die. She complies, and in a few years time turns into Josephine, who gets orders on the outside from time to time to do tasks like dress up in a maid's outfit to serve potential targets, or to ready herself to kill someone long-range at a moment's notice.Besson crafts his main story by creating a sort of love triangle between Nikita/Josephine/Marie, her boss Bob, and her conventional lover Marco, a grocery store cashier who doesn't know what she really does. Besson tools with the elements for a much more conventional thriller, and from time to time it could appear like La Femme Nikita will veer into that realm and not return. But Besson is smart; he crafts the first hour like a kind of 'Taming of the Shrew' saga (or 'Taming of a Shrill Bad-ass'), filled with juicy, dark humor ranging from the ultra-violent (pencil in the hand anyone?) to the silly and playful (training with karate instructors). And as pure director of action sequences Besson shows himself as one of the more distinct masters; it's succinctly fresh and tense while holding the ingredients for what mainstream audiences crave, chiefly in that centerpiece as she is told to kill someone on the night of a seemingly hot date with Bob. Even in the little things, like the scene where she watches the spy put together the concoction for the target in the hotel, works on the purest technical terms.But La Femme Nikita, for the most part, also works on emotional levels too. Besson won't be above throwing in a hard-boiled killer in the midst (Jean Reno's Victor, my favorite supporting character if only for a few pivotal scenes, and a precursor to Leon), but he'll also subvert it just a tinge for good measure. I loved seeing when Josephine has to take out the woman in Venice, her shot in sight, and is moved to tears through the words that Marco speaks to her, truthfully, not in any terms that deem him as the boring "safe" character, but as her kind of salvation from a life that she's been forced into as a final alternative. As happens often in Besson's work, in fact, the female character is put into a realm of personal chaos that is created by or leads to murder and, at the least, harrowing times with the one she cares for or about (i.e. Portman in Leon, Leeloo in Fifth Element, Joan of Arc, even Angela in Angel-A). It's not simply a gimmick in having the character be a woman- it's essential to Besson's track as a filmmaker, and Praillaud is excellent for the sort of ups and downs the character goes through, sometimes in the same scene! This isn't to say there are a few minor liabilities, if only from my perspective: the music is usually effective in that early electronic-techno beat style for a modern thriller, yet sometimes it's also a cross between a soft-core porn and Weather channel muzak; the ending felt abrupt, or at least on a first viewing (albeit it's hard to top the scene at the ambassador's HQ); and, as a minor criticism, what happened to showing how Nikita learns how to smile? (Seems a little crucial as something of her personality that's skipped over, when made to seem like a big stepping stone by Jeanne Moreau's enigmatic character.) Otherwise, a must-see, and one of Besson's best films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The convicted cop-killer is "kidnapped" by a government agency to be given one new chance. Only this time she is to become a trained spy and assassin.Luc Besson sure know how to fill a film with passion, humanity and action. This is a truly beautiful movie. It is a rather slow movie compared to your typical Hollywood movie, but then again the story and characters are also stronger. You get hooked and the movie is finished before you know it.The story is strong. It's cool, original and intriguing, yet it's simple and not hard to keep track of. You really get caught up with it. It has elements of all genre. It's got action, love and passion, drama, thriller and even some comedy in it. It's kind of a dark story, yet there are lot of funny elements to light it up a bit. Not much, just as much as it needs.The actors are great. Anne Parillaud does a great job as Nikita. She makes a psycho-like character that you, in the beginning, don't really like much, but through out the movie her real personality is revealed. At the end you won't let go of her. The rest of the cast is also truly great. Jean Reno has a small, yet very nice part. I found his character really funny. The way he just barge into the story.Eric Serra has given the movie a nice score. It supports the story, but may seem a little late 80's every now and then, but never the less it sounds good. It is passionate when needed and suspense when called for.You won't get disappointed of cinematography. It's simply beautiful. You can just sit back and enjoy the shots. Nice contrasts and nice composition and the use of wide angle lenses are really cool. The lightning is good as well. It's all really enjoyable.This movie has something for everyone. It's not a guy movie or a girl movie. It's not a adult movie or a teenage movie. This is simply a movie for everyone who enjoys good movies! I can, with no doubt, give this movie my recommendations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You could say I work...for the government. We've decided to give you another chance."I've been wanting to see La Femma Nikita for ages, as I used to be quite the fan of the TV show based on it when I was a kid. It's nice to be able to say that the movie was just as exciting and entertaining as I remember the show being.The plot is about a young drug addict who kills a cop when she and some guys are caught robbing a pharmacy. The French government fakes her death, and she's given little alternative but to join a training program to become an agent in the government's employ. The stress of living a violent life that she doesn't want and having to keep it secret from her fiancé eventually becomes too much for her to cope with.La Femme Nikita has several impressive action sequences, but it's more than just an action movie. Nikita transforms over the course of the story from a drugged-up junkie with nothing to live for to a capable and dangerous woman who wants control over her own life.All in all I thought La Femme Nikita was a solid blend of assassination and drama. The heroine is probably one of the most interesting female action protagonists ever put up on the big screen, and it's hard to overstate the impact Nikita has had on other female protagonists in these kinds of movies in the last twenty years. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>French thriller finely directed by Luc Besson about a violent junkie who becomes undercover assassin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exciting and stirring movie that is remade in American style by John Badham (1993) . A gang of armed drug-addicts break into a shop to try and steal drugs to fuel their habit and then takes place a bloody tour of force . However, the police arrive too fast and all addicts but one are killed .The hardened criminal (Anne Parillaud , role subsequently played by Bridget Fonda) , a punk-junkie sociopath acts with consistence violence, even in police custody and is given a life sentence .But after being drugged by her captors she wakes up to find that she has been spared in order to train her as a government assassin . However, top-secret agency official (a Svengali alike ,Tcheky Karyo , character interpreted in the American version by Gabriel Byrne))arranges a stage , so she can be elaborately trained as phantom killer and subdued into obedience. After a dramatic transformation, she is allowed to leave and start a new life for herself .On her eventual release she turns into a sophisticated girl thanks to an old lady (Jeanne Moreau , role also acted by Anne Bancroft) . As a cover, she gets a new identity . And with a wonderful house-mate, a broad-minded, gentle boyfriend (Jean Hugues Anglade , posteriorly performed by Dermot Mulroney) . The two fall in love, but that complicates jobs. His good influence extends to breeding her a conscience that puts love over business, alas unlike agency. However, she begins to discover that there is more to life than she previously thought and soon begins to wish she could escape from her obligation. But the government aren't so easy to evade .This exciting noir-thriller is packed with thrills , tension , suspense and lots of noisy action .From the start to the ending the action pace is fast moving, provides fast and furious entertainment with spectacular scenes. Displays nonstop action and is extremely entertaining and thrilling . Some scenes are brutal and with a load of violence. Still it's a good movie, I think furthermore the incredible chemistry between Parillaud and Karyo ,the plot was moving and intense , it makes you want to know what happens after . Anne Parillaud is pretty good as the heroine who turns in violent tendencies to patriotic use , both as the anti-social rebel of the early scenes and the sophisticated, seductive young lady of the later ones . It benefits enormously from a memorably assured performances from veteran as Jeanne Moreau , Jean Reno , Philippe Leroy and Jean Bouise whom is dedicated the movie . Atmospheric musical score by Eric Serra , though with excessive use of synthesizer . Colorful cinematography by Thierry Arbogast and perfectly remastered . The motion picture is lavishly produced and well directed by Luc Besson with his ordinary visual pyrotechnics . He often casts Jean Reno and music always by Eric Serra. Besson is the greatest producer and director from France with hits as ¨Leon¨ , ¨Joan of Arc¨ , ¨The fifth element¨ , the ¨Taxi¨ series , ¨Big blue¨ , ¨Arthur and the Minimois¨ , of course ¨Nikita¨ and many others .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very stylish French thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Until I watched this film many years ago I'd always associated foreign language films with more talky arty films, this showed that there are top quality action films made outside Hollywood too.The film opens with a group of drug addicts breaking into a pharmacy to steal drugs, things go wrong and most of them are shot and killed by the police. Nikita however survives but she is captured and jailed for the murder of a police officer. She doesn't end up in jail though she is taken in by a government agency and given the choice of working for them or being killed. She chooses to work for them and spends three years being trained in a variety of skills that will enable her to work as an assassin. On her twenty third birthday Bob, her handler, takes her out of the training facility for the first time. She thinks it is just for a meal but ends up having to kill somebody and then fight her way out of the restaurant. This is her final test before being allowed to leave the facility and make a life for herself. She isn't totally free though, whenever the agency calls she must drop whatever she is doing and perform a mission. This is complicated by the fact that she now has a fiancé who does not know what she does.The action scenes are all very stylishly executed and the acting seemed good, although not speaking French I had to rely on the subtitles to understand what was being said. I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who likes action films, especially to people who liked Luc Besson's later film Leon, the main character of which is based on Victor, the cleaner, in Nikita.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spontaneity starts here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nikita lived in my mind as an action movie with lots of blood, aggression, fear, all kinds of things I'm not very fond of to watch in a cinema. But I have seen this film more than ten years ago and things change and now Nikita is not that cruel movie anymore.I came back to re-watch Nikita after a lecture I heard about spontaneity and creativity. The speaker cited Nikita as an example for spontaneity. He told about the scene when Nikita gets the guns in the red box as a present and is told to kill a man behind her in the restaurant, run out of the room, look for the men's toilet, check the last cabinet and climb out on the small window there with place only for a women of her size to get through; the car is waiting for her for 5 minutes outside. Nikita does as told, shoots, runs, searches, opens the window - but then the windows is walled. And here starts spontaneity - what to do now? In fact, I watched the entire movie to see this scene - wow I learned again something!Otherwise, Nikita is rather a 'sweet action movie' by my standards of today. The storyline is interesting, the playing is OK, just the whole is unpolished and a bit rough to me. However, no question, back then, this movie was the starter for a whole series of story lines and Luc Besson merits credit for his originality. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the outset Nikita is a classy film. Luc Besson really knows his stuff and as I watched this film I could see the quality of character and direction he gives the movie. The lead actress I have read on here is apparently 'ugly' - well what does that have to do with the story? Did she have to be a hot piece of ass? No, she didn't she was cast as she is a great actress who was physically right and most believable for the role. Luc Besson is not interested in satisfying horny teenagers, he is making a 'proper' film that has stood the test of time. From the beginning the story grips you - Nikita is a teenage psychotic tear away with a group of friends equally as bad. After a cool shootout and the murder of a cop she is arrested and sentenced to life in prison. A story is fabricated that she committed suicide and she is given the option by the government to become their assassin or be killed. The whole first part of the movie is very strong, as Nikita develops from a miserable aggressive psycho into a human being again. Her relationship with her mentor is very understated and interesting. She is released into society again after passing her initial 'test' or first assignment. This is the real highlight of the film - a cool shoot out in a restaurant. Once back into society she meets a man and falls in love and basically starts enjoying life with a new perspective and value for her own life and that of others. However the government are not far away with more assignments for her. All this is still very entertaining, however as we edge towards the end I did feel it sagged a little. Her last assignment is not really gripping enough and I was getting a little bored, however the very end as the two men who fell in love with her meet just after she has gone on the run, is very satisfying and it stops at the right point to leave the viewer with an almost sad feeling. I like this film very much, the lead actress is brave, fearless and shows great range. I love the relationship with the mentor and the action is used at the right time. Apart from the end it would have been perfect. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the high points of the cinéma du look movement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember back in the 90's I had the iconic Nikita poster, which had a very leggy Anne Parillaud kitted out in a little tight black dress while cocking a huge hand gun. It was one of the definitive movie posters of its day and went some way in adding to the film's overall reputation as something cool that had to be seen. Over the years Nikita has become less well remembered but it definitely remains one of the high points of the French cinéma du look movement. It follows the story of a violent drug addicted young woman, who is imprisoned for killing a police officer during an armed robbery. Recognising her skills as useful, a secret government agency fakes her death and gives her the opportunity to be reborn in a new life as a professional killer.Directed by Luc Besson, this is a fairly typical example of his work at its best where we have an action-thriller which is elevated by an ultra-stylish presentation. It has a very glossy veneer to it, with some chic fashions and ornate locations but in amongst that it does have some grit. The central character played by Parillaud really exemplifies this, where she is moulded into a sophisticated killer but who underneath is a feral street fighter. Parillaud definitely covers a lot of ground here in a strong performance. She isn't afraid to play the character very unglamorous and annoying where required - the slinky creature on the poster is only part of the deal here! The transformation of this character is overseen by an enigmatic agent called Bob who develops feelings for his charge while reconfiguring her. It's a story-line which has definite parallels to Pygmalion. In fact, much of Nikita isn't really in thriller territory at all. Much focus is made of the relationship Nikita embarks on in the latter half of the film with a shop assistant played by Jean-Hugues Anglade, who in a neat role reversal plays a part which is typically played by women in most films of these kinds. Anglade is the good natured partner who is Nikita's anchor on reality while she embarks on her secret and deadly missions. One particularly exemplary example of this occurs in a scene in Venice where she assassinates a designated victim while having a conversation with Anglade through a bathroom door. It's scenes like this one and others where the central character embarks on her missions where the film usually peaks for me. In one of these latter sequences we are introduced to the sinister character of 'The Cleaner' in a role played by Jean Reno which was so striking that Besson based one of his next films around this idea, namely Leon (1994).I think Nikita may be the best film that Besson ever made. The combination of an interesting central character, good concept and stylised direction add up to an action-thriller of significant pedigree. It was remade in America with Bridget Fonda in the lead role under the title of Point of No Return (1993), a film which many people seem to hate but which I actually thought was a very good alternative. So my advice would be, watch both and decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reading up about the Cinéma du look movement,I found out that before his collaborations with Liam Neeson, Luc Besson was one of the leaders of the movement.With having heard about the impact that the film had for years,I decided that it was time to meet the original Nikita.The plot:Going with some pals to rob a pharmacy, Nikita gets caught up in a shoot out with the local police. Horrified to see her friends get killed,Nikita kills a cop at point-blank range. Arrested,Nikita ends up getting sentenced to life in jail. Taken by Nikita's anger,the police decide to fake her death.Revealing Nikita's death certificate,the police reveal to Nikita that they have decided to give her a second chance in life,as a secret agent government assassin.View on the film:Sliding along on Eric Serra's ice cool score,writer/director Luc Besson &amp; cinematographer Thierry Arbogast treat the pulpy tale of Nikita to lavish Cinéma du look glamour.Covering the film in neon yellows,lush greens and burning blood reds,Besson and Arbogast turn Nikita into a living comic-book,where the vibrant colours burst on the screen,and glamorous tracking shots place Nikita in comic-book style frames.Keeping a distance from going too in-depth into Nikita's background,the screenplay by Besson cuts Nikita as a razor sharp femme fatal,whose thrust for a drug hit Besson transforms into an assassination hit. Inspired by Film Noir,Besson takes a clinical approach to Nikita's training into being an assassin,that is trapped in a world where doubt/remorse are locked away for a successful "hit", which causes Nikita to question her role as a soulless femme fatale.Gliding in with a real swagger,Jean Reno gives a wonderfully animated performance as Victor "The Cleaner" Nettoyeur,whilst Jeanne Moreau gives the title a graceful touch as Nikita trainer Amanda.Entering the film kicking &amp; screaming, Anne Parillaud gives a powerful performance as Nikita,thanks to Parillaud snarling with a Punk Rock anger over where she has ended up,which Parillaud neatly balances with a calculating side,as Nikita sets her sights on a new hit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anne Parllaud is Nikita, a reformed heroin addict and thief, who after a robbery gone wrong, has killed a cop and is serving a life sentence. The only way out is to become an undercover assassin for a covert agency, working for the government. The authorities fake her death and put her through a rigorous training program to learn how to kill efficiently and quietly. Her first job is to terminate a diplomat at a busy restaurant and the female James Bond proves up to the task. She meets Marco while food shopping and he becomes her boyfriend. He does not know about her clandestine activities. In another operation involving "Victor the cleaner" at an embassy results in his death and complications for her. Marco discovers her hidden identity and requests that she needs to change her life. Nikita is the female counterpoint to Besson's Leon: The Professional; though not as good, but still a worthy action film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>La Femme Nikita</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this movie has a few short-comings, particularly in the beginning, I really liked it. Anne Paillard and Tcheky Karyo gave brilliant performances. The artful way the movie mixed thrilling espionage scenes with warm, human emotional scenes is a testament to Luc Besson's talent as a director.Critics cite Besson as a pivotal figure in the 'Cinéma du look' movement, a specific, highly visual style produced from the 1980s into the early 1990s. Subway, The Big Blue and Nikita are all considered to be of this stylistic school. The term was coined in a 1989 essay, in 'La Revue du Cinema n° 449', by Raphaël Bassan, in which Besson was lumped with two other directors who shared "le look." These directors were said to favor style over substance, spectacle over narrative.Most of the filmmakers in the category, including Besson, squirmed uncomfortably at being labeled, particularly in light of their forebears: France's New Wave. "Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut were rebelling against existing cultural values and used cinema as a means of expression simply because it was the most 'avant-garde' medium at the time," said Besson in The New York Times. "Today, the revolution is occurring entirely within the industry and is led by people who want to change the look of movies by making them better, more convincing and pleasurable to watch."Because it's becoming increasingly difficult to break into this field, we have developed a psychological armor and are ready to do anything in order to work", he added in this same interview. "I think our ardor alone is going to shake the pillars of the movie-making establishment."Besson is working on a film called The Lady (original title Dans la Lumiere), due to be released in the fall of 2011. He is also working on Lockout due to be released in April 2012. He is also co-producer of a film called Colombiana, also scheduled to be released in August 2011.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Luc Besson scores yet again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luc Besson manages to take a rather mundane story and infuses it with so much style that one forgets its mediocrity. This is not a dig, but a compliment. Nikita is a thriller of sorts, but also a story of the dregs of society coming to find her own sense of humanity. When the story threatens to be come predictable, it refrains nicely from doing so, even flouts conventions by simply moving on as opposed to wasting precious film with unnecessary scenes of crises overcome. The characters are perfectly portrayed, with a convoluted love story both tender and sadistic. Jean Reno sort of steals the show at one of the pivotal moments for our heroine, but it only adds to the complexity of the emotional side of the story and forces the viewer to keep up. Shot composure was incredible, where even the prosaic becomes a source of fascination. The score, while a tad 80s, adds to the story instead of just being an afterthought. With Besson at his finest, this is a must see for all lovers of the cinema.Evil Eye Reviews</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Parillaud delivers a breakthrough performance as the title character, a convicted murderer whom the government gives a second chance in exchange for using her as an assassin and spy. The action scenes are memorable and top-notch. It's hard to know whether to like or dislike the characters, since they're not quite three-dimensional enough to feel something for nor are they that unlikable to despise. The romance may be appropriate to establish feeling, but the characters' interaction with each other seems dry and lacks chemistry. Jean Reno is extremely underused as Victor The Cleaner. Very stylish to say the least and is a good enough film to make the must-see lists of anyone who likes action and/or foreign films. Remade as "Black Cat" in Hong Kong, and "Point of No Return" in the USA.*** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Films of Luc Besson: La Femme Nikita.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>La Femme Nikita (1990) was a great movie from genre director Luc Besson. The story is about a drugged out young woman (Anne Parillund) who's hung out with the wrong crowd one too many times. During a botched drug store robbery and subsequent shoot out with the police, NIkita is the only survivor. She's tried, sentenced and executed. But, she wakes up in a strange room and greeted by a quiet and subdued individual (Tcheky Kayro) he tells her that she's been given a second chance at life. But will she do what needs to be done in order for her to receive. Will Nikita take this opportunity at a second life or will she throw it all away? Watch LA FEMME NIKITA to find out.The always imitated by never properly duplicated chic thriller has become a fixture in pop culture. Not only was this film remade several times but it also spawned an unrelated television series. Anne Parillund is super hot in her role as Nikita. Watch out for Luc Besson regular Jean Reno as Victor the Cleaner.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very stylish and artistic thriller; one of the best films of the decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the moment the title "Nikita" appears on the screen and you hear Eric Serra's loud, cool, industrial-sounding score, you know you're in for a ride. "La Femme Nikita" is one of the most important films of the nineties, an outstanding thriller that revolutionized French cinema.Anne Parillaud stars as Nikita, a young punk who kills three cops while trying to get drugs. She is sentenced to life in prison, but instead of going to jail, she finds that her death has been faked. She is given a new identity, and trained by the government as an elite assassin. After three years of training, she is allowed back on the streets, free to enjoy life, with one condition - whenever the government needs her, she be there. The consequence of not responding to a call is death.The cast is terrific. Parillaud is very good. Jean-Hugues Anglade is very amiable as Nikita's loving husband, Marco. Tcheky Karyo is great, playing "Bob", Nikita's mentor and often unintentional tormentor. Jean Reno - who would later become famous for starring in director Luc Besson's "Leon" - steals the show for his brief appearance as inhumane "cleaner" Victor.Luc Besson's direction is without flaw. While he clearly has a sense of artistry, he knows exactly how to capture scenes on film. His script is also intelligent. It begins as a violent action film and becomes a suspenseful thriller, tinged with romance.Then there's Eric Serra's score. I myself have been a fan of Serra's work ever since hearing his work on "GoldenEye", and I would say "Nikita" may be his best score. It is perfect, sometimes booming, sometimes exciting, sometimes hip and sometimes sad."Nikita" - which oddly received an extended French title, "La Femme Nikita", for its international release - is one of the best thrillers made. Luc Besson knows how to make movies, and it shows here. The film's American remake, "Point of No Return", couldn't begin to compete with this film, and although the popular TV series inspired by this film may have been great, it still can't compare to the original. A true, top-notch thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intriguing classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Josephine' in her little black dress, crouched in a hotel kitchen, HUGE smoking hand-cannon swaying in her delicate little paws, not entirely sure what she's doing......equals my all-time favourite movie poster and an enduring image of a wonderfully crafted, absorbing study of love, penance and obligation. Throw in a funky, pulsing score and you have a modern classic. The film is generally slow-paced save for a couple of genuinely exciting and achingly cool set-pieces and is more an examination of Marie's transformation and rehabilitation than anything else. If you want consistent, high-octane thrills then look elsewhere because this beautiful film packs an emotional rather than physical punch. Anne Parillaud as 'Marie' (Nikita/Josephine) in the lead role is breathtaking and her failure to feature since in any picture of note baffles me. She is the centrepiece of the film: aggressive, fragile, tactile, ugly, beautiful, cold, efficient, she runs the gamut of human emotion and in doing so lingers on as one of the most complex and memorable female characters in recent movie history. Time is a central character here; much as in Gaspar Noe's 'Irreversible' it is all-powerful and destroys everything, good and bad. It's passage is portrayed regularly, symbolic of Marie's simultaneous progress and rehabilitation. The lighting here is also effective, giving the film an almost washed-out feel. Hollywood again take note, this is a REAL film about love and pain of the most excruciating kind: of having no control, identity or direction and hurting those about whom you care the most. A must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An action flick with substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just caught this on Bravo and I must say it was very well done. I have been a Luc Besson fan ever since the first time I saw The Professional, and after reading so many good reviews about La Femme Nikita, I just had to see it. First off, I was a little apprehensive about seeing this one due to the horrible Point of No Return, but I am glad that I did because the remake does not do the original any justice at all. And yes, it is in French with American subtitles but even for those who simply abhor subtitles, it is not a problem with Nikita. Besson's direction and characters grip you on the edge of your seat nearly the whole time, and the dialogue is crisp and to the point. This, and The Professional flow so nicely that there are no dull moments at all...it is an action flick with substance, a combination that is very hard to find, but a pleasure to watch.The actress who plays Nikita is top notch and very believable. Two of my favorite actors who happened to be in this film really stood out from the rest. Tcheky Karyo as Bob really was wonderful as the mysterious mentor of Nikita who harbors a secret love for her. I wish there had been more of this relationship in the movie...I think it would have developed into a really interesting love triangle. Jean Reno was also in this one playing it cool once again as 'The Cleaner' who is the epitome of brutal efficiency. He steals every scene that he is in in a role that is very similar to Leon in The Professional.I am still amazed at how this movie is worlds apart from Point of No Return...especially the relationship with Nikita and her fiancee...in PONR, it was horribly unbelievable, but in Nikita, it is quite the opposite. Nikita's remake fails to deliver the believability of this relationship and in essence, bores the viewer incredibly throughout the entire middle of the film. Nikita though, as I said before, has very few dull moments. Kudos to Besson for having the talent to truly grip his audience and not rely on just impressive gunfights.Overall, an excellent film worthy of multiple viewings. My only complaints are the fact that there are several 'lapses' of time that are poorly executed (for example, in one scene, Nikita seduces a charming grocery store clerk, and one scene later, they are talking like they've known each other for years...it is then we find out, oddly, they have been together for 6 mos) and the ending. ***Spoilers Ahead*** The whole movie kept me gripped, and then it just kinda ended. No real character epitomizing finale, all we get is conversation between two of our supporting leads and then we find out she is gone. She just leaves, with apparently no worries that she will be tracked down by the agency. I felt something was really missing from the ending, especially since we had seen this slow transformation from cold blooded killer into a loving human being. Other than that though, the movie was top notch.***End Spoilers***Fans of The Professional will love this one. This is a great film that has a lot of substance and a lot of crowd pleasing action and suspense. 9/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably great for its time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nikita is well esconced in the '80s, even though it came out in 1990. The music, the clothing style, the hair styles, etc. For 80's nostalgia buffs, it works. My main problem with this film is in plot development. Some of the portions of the movie were disjointed. For example, when Bob informs Nikita she has 2 weeks to shape up or ship out in a box, nothing is shown of the transformation. All we see is Nikita being released to the outside world -- one has to make the assumption she has the skills necessary to be a spy/assassin and control of her psychotic nature. I also didn't believe Parraud's character falling for the checkout clerk in such a quick fashion and actually maintaining anything like a normal life (outside of her other life as an assassin). Parraud goes a little over the top in trying to portray a psychotic woman, and when she sings her song about the mouse or jumps up on a chair pretending to be a gondolier, it's just pretty awful. I did like the camera work where they follow a bullet from her gun to a wall where a man was hiding. If Luc Besson made this movie today, there would be a lot more details in Nikita's character and in her special training as an assassin (a la Neo in the Matrix). After saying all that, however, I think Nikita is worth checking out because of its originality and being ahead of it's time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every time when a film by Luc Besson is released in France,it invariably ends up in the creation of a major event of unmatched intensity.This was exactly the feeling felt in France when Nikita hit French screens in 1990.Luc Besson is an important director in the history of French cinema.He is one of the few French directors whose works have been hailed by critics as well as viewers.If one states that cinema of look concept has been initiated by Jean Jacques Beinex, it must be added that Luc Besson merits a justified place in that category.Nikita is a complete concept film.Although it has its fair share of weaknesses but its strengths in many departments has made it a cult film.The weak areas are something about which director Luc Besson could not have done much as it is difficult to incorporate comedy and love story in an action film.A major weak spot concerns the role played by famous French actress Jeanne Moreau.Her presence was completely out of focus in a film dominated by major action stars like Tcheky Karyo and Jean Reno.The theme of love felt by the boyfriend of an ex junkie transformed into spy was also too hot for Jean Hughes Anglade to handle.This is one reason why nothing much can be said about the love chemistry between Anne Parillaud and Jean Hughes Anglade.The strengths of this film include its hypnotic musical score and taut editing.A couple of sentences should also be written about action scenes filmed in Nikita".They seem to be the handiwork of nihilists hell bent on destroying the social fabric of a civilized society.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Nikita" gave rise to both a big budget Hollywood movie starring the ever-fetching Bridget Fonda (Point of No Return) and a television series starring Peta Wilson. The series found a loyal audience (it was a cult favorite) and had a successful run of some ninety-six episodes.The US movie and the TV series each took a somewhat different tack with the material, though they started from the same place. This says something for the concepts found in Luc Besson's excellent story, but the most exceptional aspect of "Nikita" is Anne Parillaud's gripping and unforgettable performance. Her portrayal of the conflicted nihilistic punk Nikita has served as a model for a host of strong female characters, from Buffy to Sydney Bristow (Alias). The depth and complexity Parillaud brings to the fragile yet deadly character of Nikita makes this one of the most memorable performances on film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nikita, while good, does not approach the high art that is León. While the fact that this plot has been imitated so frequently must make it seem less original than at its release, it was never really ironclad to begin with. On the other hand, it fits perfectly the more character-driven progression that is the movie's aim. Like Besson's masterpiece, a strong character in difficult situations powers the film, yet Nikita, for all her gender issues, is simply not developed enough to support the considerable weight bestowed upon her by this director's dead-serious style. Yet this is structural and by no means the fault of Perillaud who is excellent. She pulls off many instances of double roles which are not easy: she is strong but unsure, brutal yet smart, masculine but feminine, animal yet human. To accentuate this is the artful but not annoying cinematography which has what seems like a fresh angle and style for all the various aspects of Nikita. While not entirely typical, neither was the score entirely memorable. And while this film has much more to offer, it must be said that the action scenes were first-rate. Never tame and often surprising, they gave a true sense of struggle rather than any glorification of gore. Overall, the film is excellent as action, strong as a film, and worth seeing in the original French. [7/10]</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upon cinematic release, being fascinated with Bridget Fonda, I watched 'Point of No Return', which I enjoyed but had no idea it was based on Besson's film. Badham's work was okay in my books, but nothing spectacular. Over the years I had loved those films of his I had seen ('Leon: The Professional', 'The Fifth Element', 'The Family' and 'Lucy'), and decided I wanted to see his earlier classic. I like the fact that Besson always has some hand in the writing, and the exquisite and graceful small part he wrote for acting legend Jeanne Moreau, virtually a microcosm of everything splendid she had ever brought to the screen. Besson has a very good feel for the genres his films represent--he plays to his strengths, and is not afraid to stick to his guns (for example, I'm glad he chose the ending that he did). The two significant extras on my DVD, remarking on the making of the film, and the sound selections by scorer Eric Serra, were both informative and entertaining, and added significant value. I highly recommend the experience to those who only think of 'The Fifth Element' when they think of Luc's work--you're in for a real treat...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish and Interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to spy cinema, Americans generally know it through franchises like James Bond, Mission: Impossible, the Bourne series, and... Spy Kids. Those films generally paint two portraits of the spy life. Either glamorous and exotic, or intense and brutal. Nikita is an interesting film in the genre. While it certainly leans more towards the latter, it's one of the very films in the genre that both shows a realistic depiction of spy life but at the same time, stylizes it. But does Nikita work as a film? Let's find out.The plot follows a teenage junkie by the name of Nikita, who gets arrested one night after partaking in a drug store robbery that goes horribly wrong where she murders a policeman in cold-blood, making her guilty of serving a life sentence. However, the French government fakes a suicide for her to become a spy/assassin.What's interesting about Nikita is its look into the life of a spy. This isn't James Bond, there's no gadgets, no witty one-liners, and no larger-than-life villains. What we have INSTEAD, is a look into a woman being turned by the French government from a teenage junkie to a dangerous killing machine. Nikita is a woman who starts out with no meaning in life as she hangs around with junkies and is addicted to drugs herself but after she's trained to be a spy, she becomes a lethal killing machine but in the meantime, becomes refined, mentally stable, and even attractive. What's interesting about this is the MORALITY. On one hand, she MURDERED a policeman, so she deserves punishment but at the same time, once she gets out of spy school, she cares and appreciates not just for her life, but also for society and towards the END, she ditches her mission and runs away to leave the life of a spy. The film's message can be pretty much be chalked up to "everybody deserves a second chance" and it's delivered beautifully because it's not RAMMED down your throat with lines like "Maybe Nikita, deserves another chance. Maybe, she never deserved this in the first place." which would have dumbed down the entire movie.Outside of the morality behind the film, Nikita is also very stylish. Director Luc Besson directs this film with a strange mix of realism and style but somehow, it works! This movie has its fair share of brutal realism with scenes like "the Cleaner" using acid to melt down the bodies of those he killed or Nikita trying to break out by threatening her supervisor, Bob, at gunpoint but there's also scenes of style such as the speech her instructor, Amande tells about femininity and the means of using it or the scenes of Nikita training comically in spy school. The reason this works is because neither styles go too far, so they end up complimenting each other and creating its own style rather than making for something inconsistent and jarring. The cinematography by Thierry Arbogast is also quite good at creating this gritty, stylized look.But with all that good said, this is not a perfect movie. One of its biggest flaws is the confused timeframe presented in the story. The movie spans over years of Nikita training to become a spy but the way it's edited makes it feel like only a few weeks/months have gone by so when one of the heads of the organization says "Nikita has been training here for six years.", you'll just be left sitting there like "Wait, it's been six years?"Another problem is the character of Marco. He's just really bland and uninteresting throughout. He's supposed to be the man who wins Nikita's heart and make her appreciate life more but the thing is, while he seems like a really nice guy, his interactions with Nikita aren't very interesting. He questions her here and there about things like why she never has friends or family over at her place or why she spends so much time in the bathroom ignoring him but it never amounts to anything more than that. I would've liked to see him actually get MAD at her at one point and have an argument play out, I think that would've been a little more interesting.The last of the major problems is the score by Eric Serra. It just sounds incredibly bland and sterile throughout. There's some scenes in the film where I literally felt like ripping my HAIR out because of how mind-inducingly dull it is. Although, I did like the music when "the Cleaner" was taking care of business.However, those problems aren't NEARLY strong enough to ruin the film because of the excellent cast. Anne Parillaud gives a truly spectacular performance as Nikita. Her change from teenage junkie to refined assassin is very believable and all her conflicting emotions about being a spy feel very real and believable. Tcheky Karyo plays Bob fascinatingly with a polite persona but with an underlying intensity that makes you really think and question his feelings towards Nikita effectively. While I thought his character was a little bland, Jean- Hugues Anglade does the best he can as Marco and remains likable the entire film. Lastly, while "the Cleaner" doesn't get a whole lot of screen time, Reno stands out as a cool and bada$$ character in the film.Overall, while it has some issues regarding the timeframe, the character of Marco, and the score. Nikita is still an interesting character study with stylish direction and an excellent cast. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It opens with a burst of violence as a handful of Parisian skinhead dopers break into a drug store and start smashing everything in sight under the neon blue lights. There's a shoot out when the police arrive. Shelves of glass containers explode under the fusillade. The bodies pile up, shot to shreds. Anne Parillaud, a gang moll, senselessly blows the head off a helpless gendarme. The editing is quick, the air filled with curses, the colors garish. In other words, it's an imitation of an American action movie.It was remade in 1993, as "Point of No Return," with Bridget Fonda in the starring role of the drugged-out psychopath coerced and trained to be a cool government assassin. Let's see -- that would make the later production an American imitation of a French imitation of an American action movie. A few shots are identical. Bridget Fonda is cuter than Anne Parillaud and sexier too, but she's not nearly Parillaud's equal as an expressive actress. Watch Parillaud's infantile delight when she dines out with her government mentor and he gives her a birthday present in the fancy restaurant.There's quite a bit of gore but not nearly as much as in most American action films of the 80s. After that initial shoot out, deaths tend to take place in singles, not in grand slams. Released from the Institute (or whatever the agency is called) and only drafted for occasional special killings, Parillaud begins to enjoy her freedom. She has an affair with Jean-Hugues Anglade, an affable guy with a kind but slightly goofy face. This generates a bit of jealousy on the part of her government guru, Tchéky Karyo, who has developed a subdued yen for her. But it's just as well he doesn't get her. He has a face like a tractor with a steel plow attached to its front end.I don't know how well the chips fall into place from a psychological point of view. Parillaud is a real beast at the beginning, a maniacal puppet who tries to bite the ear off her judo instructor. She beans her mentor over the head with a crockery pot and he almost bleeds out. She breaks into wild dances for no reason. I would think professional assassins need to be something other than impulsive and unthinking. They need the soul of a tax auditor not the showmanship of a vaudeville clown. However, the Frog temperament sometimes insists on doing things upside down.Jeanne Moreau shows up as a tutor in the finer feminine arts. My God, what a face. It's made for the camera. She was never a Hollywood-gorgeous beauty but she was always magnetic. Same with Jean Reno, who shows up at a botched murder as "the cleanup man." There have been so many cleanup men in these kinds of movies that if I see any more I'll start to think they exist.This movie is a longie at one hour and fifty-seven minutes but it's not slow. The sets are perfectly done, from grand to ruined. The acting is professional throughout. The camera doesn't wobble drunkenly and the editing slows down after the first five minutes so that it's possible to tell who is doing what to whom.Worth catching if it's on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NikitaThe reason teenagers make such bad assassins is that they Tweet their target and location beforehand, resulting in blood-soaked ambushes.And while the teen assassin in this action movie isn't tweeting, she is tweaking.When a group of juvenile junkies attempt to heist a pharmacy, they find themselves in a shootout with police.For her part in the incident, drug addict Nikita (Anne Parillaud) is sentenced to death. However, instead of execution, she is spirited away by French intelligence and trained to be an elite assassin.With a meteoric rise through the hit person ranks, she is soon groomed for the position of sleeper agent.Unfortunately, her undercover mission is jeopardized when she falls in love.A thrilling portrayal of a feisty femme fatale, director Luc Besson presents a gritty, violent depiction of what it takes to be a hit woman.Besides, when women assassins have PMS, their productivity triples.

		<shortDescription>Leon(a) goes to finishing school... (POSSIBILITY OF SPOILERS!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... Let's get the basics out of the way, first. "Nikita" is a good film; with all of the visual flourishes and compelling mood that it seems can be found in the bulk of Besson's work. If you are coming to this review BEFORE having seen "Leon" ("The Professional") then my best advice is just to disregard the rest of what follows and take "Nikita" on its own terms. Hope you enjoy it!* (COMPARISON WITH 'LEON' - RISK OF SPOILERS FOR BOTH FILMS!) ... I know there is some debate amongst film fans over which constitutes the most satisfying experience. Personally; I'd have to pick "Leon". Disregarding the sex of the character, "Leon" as an enterprise is like a more 'plush' version of Besson's 1990 assassin effort. It's like a before and after snapshot; Leon's pretty much 'compartmentalized' his life - Nikita's struggling to get a grip on hers...Perhaps "Leon" represents the evolution of Besson's 'paternal' instinct; as he watches his own children grow. There is certainly a greater degree of patience shown from outside influences in Mathilda's case, as opposed to Nikita... The original street kid is the quintessential animal; and although we are shown what instigates her partial transformation, her support system is never quite as convincingly 'solid' as that provided by Leon and Tony...I suppose the tension bubbling under the surface does provide a comedic highlight; as Marco lies dreamily on the bed and coos to his supposedly 'docile' mate that he didn't know what he'd come across when he first met her - cut to our heroine assembling a gun in the bathroom... Guess what, mate; you STILL don't... ! Having more 'rounded' characters with less rough edges DID make it easier for me to become 'emotionally involved', though. Would Leon have opened the door for Mathilda if he hadn't been schooled by someone with perhaps similar thought processes to Bob?? In Leon we see the individual that "Nikita" would like to become by obtaining her freedom...Those who prefer to dispassionately study people and their actions from a distance might just retain a softer spot for "Nikita". It's certainly interesting to speculate on what motivated the changes in his later work, though... !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily, the best of the genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long before there were all of the "edgy, dangerous, and sexy" women we now see in action films every day, there was Anne Parillaud. In the over two decades since this seminal film was produced, unfortunately, they have never produced another actress quite like her. When I first viewed this movie, I was totally unprepared for what I was going to see, a virtual force of nature in a slim female figure. As a working actor myself, there are certain things that make a great actor, or a great performance. Part of this magic involves someone who not only fully understands the character, but brings the creative energy and intelligence to the role, fearlessly and without self-consciousness. Parillaud was like watching a master class in the art of acting... she embodied all of these essential qualities, and more. But with all the many good young actors today, NONE could have played the part with such a fully realized landscape of every human emotion imaginable?from drug-induced psychosis, to unfettered youthful rebellion, to total surrender and adulthood, then ultimately morphing to a beautiful compromise of each. Rather than recount all the story points of this movie, I only wish the reader to simply pick up a copy of this film, and watch the original "Nikita" do her thing. I can only describe her fabulous performance as, "Feral." WATCH IT.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The work of the Assassin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luc Besson's Nikita was one of the most stylish action thrillers to come in 1990. It was a big hit in cinemas and VHS, even in countries that dislike films with subtitles.The film was remade a few years later as The Assassin with Bridget Fonda but Anne Parillaud is stunning as the street delinquent fashioned into a kick ass assassin by her mentor Bob (Tcheky Karyo) as she works for a shadowy government agency.Luc Besson shoots this film in a stylish, moody way, something he established a few years earlier in the film Subway. Eric Serra's electronic soundtrack is more appropriate here that it did in GoldenEye.The acting is very good from the stars ranging from Parillaud, Karyo, Jeanne Moreau and Jean Reno as Bob the Cleaner. You care about the characters and the story moves along at a rapid rate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How morality comes with civilisation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is almost identical to the American movie The Assassin. The American movie is based so heavily on this movie that even the lines are identical. This movie, the original, is by far better because the Americans just did not use any imagination with The Assassin.Nikita is a wild drug-addicted punk who is caught in a drug store after a hold up has gone terribly wrong. She is a wild animal and when she is confronted by the police, instead of pretending to be a frightened girl, she blows his head off and is thus arrested and charged for the murder of the other officers. She is sentenced to life imprisonment and subsequently killed. The catch is is that the death is faked and she is revived in a secret government organisation and trained as an assassin.The American movie is very glizty as is typical of Hollywood. They made everything look nice and sophisticated, including Bridget Fonda. Nikita is nothing like this. Luc Besson has the ability to use the dark and dingy effectively. Nikita is wild and her unkept appearance is made to reflect this. Through the movie we watch her as she is slowly tamed and made into a civilised woman. Even so, we still receive glimpses of who she was.With civilisation comes morality. When she was wild she killed the cop without a second thought, but as she is tamed, she begins to realise the results of her actions. She is ordered to kill a woman and after the truth of her actions hits her. As she falls in love with a young checkout clerk, Marco, we watch how her passions rise up inside of her and how the sanctity of human life dawns upon her. We see a different woman retch at the sight of Victor the Cleaner pouring acid on a living body than when she kills a cop in cold blood.The action in the Assassin mimics the action in Nikita almost identically. Yet in Nikita we see that Luc Besson has created something that is real. The Agency is not a high tech cement bunker but the basement of an old building with walls with crumbling plaster. The bed is an old hospital bed and the floor is bathroom tiles. The major difference is that we see two worlds in the two movies. The Assassin is America and Nikita is France, the new world and the old world, Paris and Los Angeles. Nikita is by far the better movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extreme psychological and physical violence - but brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the most violent film I have ever seen. I don't particularly like violent films, I'm not a huge action fan, and I dislike thrillers. But I was completely spellbound by this film.I've never left another theater and found myself walking with my back to the wall.There are other films with more blood and gore, more dead bodies, more gunshots, and more action. But for sheer cold violence - Victor, Nettoyer - nothing comes close to La Femme Nikita.* And the violence doesn't stop at the physical - it continues down burrowing down into the psychology. But the reasons it is so good are not so easy to identify. There may be clues in the many spin-offs and remakes may provide some clues - because none of them are remotely close. So it can't be purely the story, or the premise. And other actors with arguably more experience haven't delivered on the role, so it's not solely the acting (or actors).And there are some aspects of the production that are distinctly unpromising - in particular the fact that the director created the film purely as a vehicle to allow (girlfriend?) Parillaud to break out of the stereotype straight-jacket she was sewn into by her prior roles. There's no doubt Peraud is attractively packaged, and for males at least the role could create a fatal fascination with the female spider. But dropping other attractive actresses into hot roles is usually a guarantee of mediocrity or comic-strip soft porn.Perhaps the foreign language helps to make the other world both more exotic, yet more believable at the same time? But there must be far more to it than that.So often directors, writers, actors and studios set out to make a 'great' film, and despite all the money, talent and attention, it goes nowhere special.Yet on some less promising evening, all the stars and planets align on cue: The story may be discomforting, the violence offensive, actors and directors you have never heard of, in a language you cannot understand - but you are absolutely transfixed.There are some weak points to the film, particularly in the early going, where belief is stretched too thin before you are drawn down into another world. It is unfortunate because these probably could have been avoided, and the film would have approached perfection. It would be nice to give it a 10, but it's not there.But even as it is, I find it amazing that a film can be so good as to make me love something I don't like.You may not enjoy this film. You may not approve of this film. You might not sleep easily after this film. But you will feel as though you have seen truly great cinema.The downside? Films like this make run-of-the-mill TV and movies impossible to waste your time watching.*Except perhaps Pulp Fiction, but the spider's web there was more coarsely spun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually exciting and thematically captivating film that blends action with drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nikita (Anne Parillaud) is a teenage delinquent, street punk and heroin abuser, who - as a means of securing another fix - participates in the robbery of a pharmacy owned by the parents of her fellow junkie friend. Unfortunately for them, the robbery goes horribly awry, degenerating into a gunfight with the local police, during which, her cohort is killed. Suffering from severe withdrawal symptoms, she shoots a police officer. Nikita is then arrested, tried, convicted of murder, and imprisoned for life, with parole considered after thirty years. In prison, she is drugged to simulate a death sentence; eventually waking up in an anonymous room, where a well-dressed hard man (Tchéky Karyo) enters and reveals to her that, although officially dead and buried after a suicide by overdose, she is, in actual fact, in the custody of the DGSE, the French intelligence agency. She is given a choice: work as a DGSE assassin or be killed. After some resistance, she chooses the former and proves a talented killer. One of her trainers, Amande (Jeanne Moreau), transforms her from grimy gutter trash into a stylish femme fatale.La Femme Nikita, or "Nikita" as it is more commonly known (1990), was very much the prototype for director Luc Besson's subsequent film, the similarly stylish hit man-themed thriller Léon (1994); albeit, on a smaller scale and with a slightly more feminist edge. Here, alongside certain visual motifs and preoccupations with movement and rhythm, we can already see the thematic fascination with hit men, mob bosses, hotel room shoot-outs and the juxtaposition between femininity and a degree of required masculinity - as well as an early appearance from Besson regular Jean Reno as a character that very much prefigures the one that he would subsequently go on to portray - all taking shape as the foundation for something much more substantial. Not that La Femme Nikita is simply a mere experiment for that later work; on the contrary, this is possibly Besson's true birth as a filmmaker of real emotional depth, and the first of three flat-out masterpieces that he directed in the 1990's.Previous Besson films, such as those tied fairly rigidly to the confines of the "cinema du look" movement - a brief cinematic resurgence in 1980's French cinema that saw a younger generation of filmmakers looking back to the days of Godard, Truffaut and the Nouvelle Vague, to create pop-culture referencing films dealing with doomed love and alienated Parisian youth - were high on style but low on plot. Take for example his first feature film, the wordless, black and white science fiction surrealist parable, Le Dernier Combat/The Last Battle (1983), which created an entirely authentic post-apocalyptic future world on an incredibly limited budget, but then fell back on having its lead actors, Jean Reno and former pop star Pierre Jolivet, do nothing for the remaining ninety minutes, other than attempt to outwit each other in a series of physical and mental tests. His second film, the much more colourful and lively Subway (1985) developed the visual ideas established in the first films of Jean Jacques Beineix and Leos Carax - alongside elements of action, comedy and revisionist film noir - though again, often at the substitution of routine plot and easily identifiable characters.Both of those films are enjoyable, unique and eclectic in their own little way, but really, for me, fail to make an impact when compared to the sheer rush of pure adrenaline presented to us by La Femme Nikita. Nikita is not only a fascinating story about a woman coming to terms with the end of her life and she once knew it, but is also a perfectly rendered drama; dealing with the emotional and psychological implications created by her newly-acquired double life. Besson perfectly juxtaposes the sweet-natured and likable Nikita and her relationship with the amiable Marco (Jean-Hughes Anglade), with the cold and calculating assassin who thinks nothing of executing her target for the exchange of cold hard cash. It's also an impressive action film; one that drips with the cool French chic of Subway or Le Grand Bleu (1988), creating an interesting and exotic approach to the scenes of violence and gunplay that would echo through to the subsequent Léon, as well as Besson's later science-fiction piece, The Fifth Element (1997).Another interesting factor is the possible relationship between Nikita and Matilda from Léon, with the potential future scenario for Matilda echoing the present situation of Nikita here. I wouldn't necessarily recommend viewing this as a prequel in any sense of the word; however, it does present an interesting duality between the two films that is further suggested by the character of "the cleaner", here played effortlessly by the aforementioned Jean Reno. Ultimately though, La Femme Nikita is about pure entertainment; taking an interesting story, some fine performances and Besson's unique stylistic flair (especially when it comes to capturing scenes of blistering action) and blending them together to produce a film that delivers on all fronts. Unlike his earlier films, Le Dernier Combat, Subway and Le Grande Bleu, the excessive use of style and occasional stabs of humour are here applied to a rich and rewarding plot and a collection of characters that are interesting, intelligent and, above all else, believable! For me, La Femme Nikita was Besson's first truly great film, and one that still, to this day, could and should be evaluated alongside his other great works, specifically Léon, The Fifth Element and the recent Angel-A (2005).</fullReview>

"Nikita" made me feel sympathy for the central characters, to the extent that I was almost in tears at times. The story is a simple one of love and longing to be free, interspersed with Besson's trademark economical-yet-bloody action scenes."Nikita" proves that there is more to Cinema than Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"La Femme Nikita"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luc Besson has been behind some of the most provocative and intriguing action films of the last 15 years, and his introduction to mainstream American cinema-goers began with 1991's "La Femme Nikita." Beginning with a drug store shootout that leaves three junkie punkers and a few policemen dead, this film is rapidly engaging and shows off Besson's violent chic. In the fray, only young Nikita (Anne Parillaud) survives, after offing a policeman who had let his guard down at a crucial moment. Facing certain death in France's court of law, she is given two choices: lethal injection, or have her execution faked, and then assume a new life as a female super-assassin/spy. A wild-raised feral child of sorts, Nikita had picked up certain skills on the street that eventually prove to be quite valuable to her government handlers, as she makes things difficult for them and especially her chief mentor Bob (Tcheky Karyo). No secret is made of his affections for her, but he tries to mold Nikita into a valuable person, and he's able to do it with the help of another agent, played by actress Jeanne Moreau, who teaches her the finer ways of womanhood. By the end of her training, Nikita has been modeled into a fine, sexy female assassin. Besson makes no attempts to sacrifice his film in the ways of Hollywood convention, and he proves that the days of female-driven action cinema are not yet dead. Parillaud is compelling, as at first, she almost seems unaware of her identity as a woman. When she isn't taking out high-powered political officials, she's romancing a kind and gentle shop clerk, who falls madly in love with her as she does with him. Lastly, "La Femme Nikita" has some of the most stylized and violent action scenes of any movie I've seen in a while. Luc Besson, with this film and much of his subsequent work, has proved he is one of cinema's most valuable personalities on the European, Asian, and American action film circuits. Also, be aware of a cameo by future Besson "Leon" (1994) star Jean Reno as Victor the Cleaner, in what is pretty much an early prototype of his role from that star-making breakthrough film.8/10</fullReview>

Some of the scenes and characters were also "borrowed" by Q.T. in his classic Pulp Fiction.

		<shortDescription>Where Gals With Guns Got Started</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer &amp; director Luc Besson's crime thriller "La Femme Nikita" served as the prototype for the gals with guns genre. Before Besson's seminal assassination saga, Hollywood had produced only a fistful of thrillers where females brandished firearms and displayed an affinity for violence that rivaled their male counterparts. You don't have to search far to see the impact that this landmark 1990 movie wrought on film and television. Hollywood remade "La Femme Nikita" in 1993 as "Point of No Return" with Bridget Fonda in the lead role and director John Badham at the helm. Later, two cable television series followed; first came "La Femme Nikita" with Peta Wilson from 1997 to 2001, and Maggie Q appeared second in "Nikita" in 2010. Along the way, Besson made "Colombiana" and countless other clones of "La Femme Nikita" have ensued. Believe it or not, this was Anne Parillaud's breakout role, and she won the French Oscar for her spirited performance. As memorable as Parillaud is as the heroine, Jean Reno makes an unforgettable impression as Victor the Cleaner who mops up the blood, gore, and bodies after a gunfight. "La Femme Nikita" qualifies as an exciting shoot'em up with Besson's slick touches, snappy dialogue, and swift pace keeping it engrossing throughout its 118 minute running time. He exploits his Parisian and Italian locations with an eye to exotic settings. Thierry Arbogast's low-angle photography contributes as much to the atmosphere and action as composer Eric Serra's brooding orchestral score. Ultimately, "La Femme Nikita" delivers more than knock-dead action and memorable characters. Ironically, the government converts a hopeless junkie into a responsible, intelligent, and sensitive individual who cannot function as a cold blooded killer even though she was recruited because of her anti-social, murderous disposition. This makes "La Femme Nikita" a worthwhile thriller than rises above its origins.</fullReview>

He is a master.Parillaud was absolutely magnificent in a character that was a strong woman, and a little girl at the same time. She was a profession, but she was also human. To see this instead of the comic book characters we are so familiar with is refreshing.Reno was a perfect cleaner. Hard and professional. Get the mission done.Jean-Hugues Anglade added just the right touch of sensitivity. Outstanding!

		<fullReview>On paper, Nikita doesn't sound to promising. In the wrong hands, the idea of a criminal being trained to become a top assassin sounds like a story that would be campy, ridiculous, and over-the-top, almost comic book like. Luckily, Nikita was in the right hands as the end result is way better than expected. The script is well written, the cinematography is beautiful, and the directing is exciting more often than not. That said, what ultimately makes Nikita work as well as it does is lead Anne Parillaud as Nikita. Parillaud doesn't have much dialogue in the first act. This leaves her to do most of her acting with facial expressions. With a lesser actress, this could have been disastrous. However, Parillaud is a strong actress and is able to pull the role off well. Perhaps it is due to her lack of dialogue that I find the first half of the picture far superior to the second half.Once Nikita's relationship with Marco begins, the film loses the same momentum it once had. This shift in tone is necessary to some extent in order to show Nikita is able to love and be human. At the same time, the result makes the film feel a bit uneven. The romance-filled middle almost feels like it belongs in another movie altogether. The romance is helped by the good performances, but the tone isn't quite right. It's a problem that probably could have been fixed in the editing process. It would be fascinating to see another cut of Nikita, one where the romance is drastically edited with scenes rearranged and maybe a few minutes taken out. For me, that would be a better version. I'm sure there are people who find the romantic segments the best part of Nikita. I am not one of them.There was never a sequel to Nikita, but the ending leaves room for one. Obviously too much time has gone by for a sequel to be made now, though I can picture one that begins right as Nikita ends. The perfect ending provides enough closure for the audience to be satisfied and just enough room for more. The ending is often the most important part in any storytelling medium, be it literature, theater, or film. The wrong ending can leave an audience frustrated. The wrong ending can even ruin the entire experience for an audience. With Nikita, Luc Besson has given the audience the most suitable ending, one that is completely satisfying. Nikita may not be perfect, though the material in the beginning and the end is so strong that only middle section prevents it from being a perfect movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably one of the best spy/action dramas ever made. It tells the history of a heroin junkie who has incredible killing capacities and fakes her death for becoming a government assassin. Luc Besson's Nikita has all: It has action, it has drama, tragedy, and even black humor (Victor the cleaner says it all) It is with a good script (few holes) a very good direction, excellent performances in everyone, thrilling music. It's the thing that James Bond never did ClassicJust one of the best. This shows while it then had an American version, but it's not worth it. The character of Nikita is golden build, as the others, and the performance by the leading actress is amazing.NikitaJust Nikita</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Only true version of this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this film. It's hard to say more, but I do love this film. Luc Besson created a masterpiece when he wrote about a troubled woman becoming a cold assassin. Well executed, well structured and edgy, this film helped define French cinema the same way Breathless,Weekend and The 1000 Blows did in the early days of the French New Wave. A classic in the making, to say the least. While Besson's Leon is a better movie, this film will always be visionary. Jean Reno's role may have been small, but he was easily the coolest character in the film. A stunning array of visual artistry and action, it's too bad Besson had a hand in making the horrible Point of No Return.</fullReview>

A sentimental adventure, the sick and the good ways. A french novel about values and sentimental windows. Scarfs of past and future as Persian carpet. Anne Parillaud in skin of reed-character. A film about sniper rifles and decisions. About search of life sense and answers behind the words. Death as scrub. And the sound of things who makes measure of feelings.

		<shortDescription>Besson's best?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remade and rehashed several times over the 1990s it's easy to forget just how good Luc Besson's 1989 original is. The action sequences, most notably the restaurant shootout and the opening heist are absolutely electric but also very brutal.Anne Parillaud won the Cesar for her performance as the title character and its easy to see why. She is utterly convincing whatever she is playing. As a junkie she looks and acts like she was pulled out of a cardboard box on a street corner but then looks utterly in control with a big gun when ordered to assassinate.Adding to Parillaud's excellence is the first class support cast. Tckeky Karyo as her sadistic mentor, Jean Hugues Anglade as her boyfriend and French cinematic legend Jeanne Moreau as the stylist to the French Secret Service. There's also a fantastic cameo from Jean Reno as The Cleaner, a little prelude to Leon perhaps? It's hard to see why they had to remake this movie, after all it's pretty Americanized (there's even a training montage!) and aside from a few hairdos and Nikita's 'mobile phone' it hasn't really dated. Seventeen years on it still looks cool. Definitely one of Besson's best</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie put director Luc Besson into the big league.The basic story is about a drugged up vicious street punk serving a life sentence for killing a cop.She is given a second chance at freedom of sorts, by a top secret French assassination agency.The movie shows her transformation into something better then she was and the affect it has on the two men in her life that mean something to her.This movie is amazingly well acted. Anne Parillaud, Marc Duret, Patrick Fontana are outstanding.This is a pretty violent movie, but not just for the sake of violence,it is a necessary counter-point to Nikkita's blossoming appreciation of life.The violence is realistic and well done.The action scene's are fast pasted and tense.Everything about this film is top notch, I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stunning thriller with a delicate touch of a love without tomorrow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Young Nikita (Anne Parillaud) commits robbery with her pals while on drugs and she kills a police officer. Instead of being put on trial, she is discovered by a special agent named Bob (Tcheky Karyo) and introduced to a special training school. Bob thinks she has the gift of becoming an assassin/spy - working for the government. At first Nikita remains fun-loving, but when she realises that it is a choice between training or death, she has to conform. Eventually, she completes the secret training and on her birthday, Bob takes her out for dinner and gives her a birthday present- her first victim.Back to the outside world, Nikita has a new identity now and she falls in love with Marco (Jean-Hughes Anglade), a supermarket cashier. They get married and start a happy life together. But soon Nikita finds out that she is to be haunted by her missions forever. In a task that is about to fail, Nikita has no way to go and her life is in danger, as well as everything else.I think it IS a good idea that the film does not mark 'two years later' or anything like that as Nikita's training progresses,as you would realise it simultaneously. The intensity between Nikita, Marco and Bob is well expressed. The love of Nikita and Marco is tender and aching. Marco is portrayed as a loving, compassionate husband. The action and suspense in the film hold your breath. 'Point of No Return', the Hollywood remake starring Bridget Fonda, is a pathetic remake and there is no comparison between 'Nikita' and 'Point of No Return'. If you have seen neither, I recommend you to see this one only.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the better French films you'll see. Not that this says much, as most French movies are pretentious crap. Nikita, on the other hand, is far from that...A woman in a criminal gang is captured after killing a policeman during a botched robbery. She is sentenced to life in prison but while in prison she is approached by a government agent who intends to make her a secret agent. She reluctantly goes along with the idea...Interesting, engaging espionage drama with some great action scenes. Plot is good and the story follows well. The set up is also well done, and quite funny at times. Quite gritty too. Has all the traits of a good drama.So good, Hollywood remade Nikita as Point of No Return / The Assassin in 1993, with Bridget Fonda in the lead role. It was also made into a Canadian TV series, La Femme Nikita. The series lasted from 1997 to 2001 and starred Peta Wilson in the lead role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great 1990's Action Film By Luc Beeson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1990's director Luc Besson was on a tear in his Native France as he paved the way with four very successful commercial films that year including the iconic "Leon: The Professional", "The Fifth Element", "Joan of Arc" and this one, the one that started it all, "La Femme Nikita". Even though "Leon: The Professional" is the best of the foursome, they're all very worthy in terms of quality. In the case of "La Femme Nikita", we need to realize that even though many situations are deemed implausible and to just sit back and enjoy some jaw-dropping action that will likely leave you in shock until the final credits roll.Anne Parillaud stars as Nikita, a rebellious, drug-addicted teen who hangs around with the wrong crowd. One night, these miscreants decide to rob a pharmacy in which one of the members' father owns the store. When the owner/father arrives on the scene with a gun, and notices his son and his friends stealing items in the store, things start to get real ugly. The father is shot to death and the police arrive on the scene where a stand-off takes shape. The gang is all shot dead with the exception of Nikita who surprisingly blows away a cop who was trying to revive her.Nikita is now incarcerated for life. While serving her time, Nikita is manipulated by her captors that she was contemplating suicide by a tranquilizer overdose. when she awakens, she is greeted by sharp clad man named Bob (Tcheky Karyo) and offers her an ultimatum. She is now under the care of the DSGE she can either be an assassin or go by way of row 8, plot 30 (her grave). She chooses to become an assassin and has excelled in the craft quite impressively. She even becomes computer savvy, skilled in martial arts and weaponry and even appears quite like a businesswoman like in appearance. After fulfilling her first missions, she is transferred to Paris as an enforcer to when the DSGE needs her. While in Paris, she meets a guy named Marco (Jean-Hughes Anglade) and they start a relationship with him oblivious as to what her profession is. Marco is puzzled as to why she has no family, friends or any kind of connection whatsoever. Bob gets invited to dinner as poses as her Uncle Bob and offers them two tickets to Venice, Italy as an engagement gift.But the trip and the moment of happiness comes to an end when Nikita receives a call about going on a mission with a sniper rifle in the bathroom. There she kills a woman and leaves her disappointed.The film ends when someone named "The Cleaner" (Jean Reno) who was sent to destroy all the evidence which at cost leaves him wounded by the embassy guards and gets killed while trying to escape from them. Marco eventually knows about her secret life and that draws concerns over her psychological scars, he decides that what's best for her is to vanish forever. Feeling that she abandoned the DSGE, Bob and Marco discuss what's in store for her, they agree she will be missed.With the exception of the rushed conclusion, this is an otherwise exciting start to the expectations of Besson's other commercial films especially "Leon: The Professional". I guess at the time Besson was still trying to master his craft as a filmmaker and though even if the pacing was contrived at times, the set-pieces were still something quite noteworthy; Nikita's induction hit, the assassination mission in Italy plus every scene featuring The Cleaner are primary examples of how dynamic Besson really is. The Cleaner is one of the coolest characters in this movie and make no mistake about it, he was the inspiration to the character Wolf from Quinton Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction" who was played by Harvey Keitel after Keitel played The Cleaner in the American 1993 "Nikita" remake. In "Leon: The Professional", Leon is believed to be a distant cousin to The Cleaner.The movie itself spawned many remakes and imitators over the past couple of decades. John Badham directed a pretty decent remake titled "Point of No Return" with Bridget Fonda playing Nikita who's name was changed to Maggie. In Canada, Joel Surnow directed a TV series starring Peta Wilson in the lead that lasted for five seasons (1997-2001). And Warner Brothers distributed a television series starring Maggie Q in the Nikita as she defected from her employment from the agency is now plotting to bring them down.The movie here was quite stimulating. Besson's direction was well executed, but the performances were quite memorable. Parillaud was Cesar winner for performance and Karyo was very convincing as Bob. But the finale was way too hurried it might leave one demanding for a sequel otherwise, it is a bit of a letdown.Overall I recommend this film with the exception of a poorly hurried finale that was anti-climactic. But the action and the performances are truly one you'll likely treasure. For those who love action films and girls with guns, you're in for a real treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Influential and Imitated Many Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Influential, as it has been directly remade (Point of No Return 1993), spawned a TV-Series, and imitated many times. Might even be responsible for the modern inclination to showcase "Girls with Guns". Although Film Buffs know that this is hardly a new concept and is actually a staple of Film Noir.This stylish and audience friendly Female Fantasy is not a great Movie but a very good French Film that has some Cool Artistic touches. The lead Actress is fine but some viewers may find that the script calls for her to display some overwrought tendencies that detract from her complex character by displays of emotional excess.That said, this is hardly a believable story but it is Fiction at its fanciful best. It bridges effectively between the Noir and Spy genres and it all makes for some fun. But Nikita suffers somewhat from too many scenes of waterworks. This ends up seeming a bit forced on the audience and is an overdone overture to elicit empathetic concern but is a visceral distraction. This is a heavy contrast to her Hard Boiled nature and could have worked better with a bit of subtlety.If you feel a need for a foray into Foreign Films with subtitles, this is a good one and no better place to start.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Art? No. But smart and fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Far-fetched? Certainly. But this odd sort of streetwise female variation on a James Bond thriller still has a lot more character and fun than the vast majority of modern mainstream action films. A drugged out. almost brain-dead punk full of attitude and anger, Nikita is caught after helping rob a drug store, leaving several cops dead. She's given a choice. Accept a quiet death penalty, or agree to be trained to be a secret government assassin. A good part of the film (and arguably the most interesting) is her training itself, as Nikita's rebellious nature keeps getting her pushed to the edge of getting kicked out (and hence executed), while her strange sullen sexiness begins to seduce her Henry Higgins, an agent assigned to oversee her who finds himself getting more than a bit obsessed. Meanwhile, the always wonderful Jeanne Moreau tries to teach this nihilistic punk how to come off as a woman of the world, the better to be able to get close to her targets. This is often argued to be a film of style over substance, and in the big picture that's probably fair. And it didn't hold up quite as well on a recent 2nd viewing 20+ years later as I hoped. But still, this spends more time on human interaction and emotion, and less on blowing stuff up than almost any of its contemporary counterparts, Not art, but for a popcorn movie smart, inventive and fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The topic of what makes your identity and identity crisis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who are we is usually either a very simple or a very difficult question depending on the situation. When people ask who we are, what do we say? What is our name, occupation, maybe we mention some hobbies. But what if they ask, "no but really, who are you?", most people become lost. "What do you mean, who am I? I told you my name and occupation." But I don't think our name shows truly who we are. I mean, there are a lot of people with the same names or the same occupation or both and they are still different. So what makes our identity? The main character Nikita is also faced with this question. After her crimes she is sentenced to death and later wakes up to be told that she will be enrolled into special agent training. That means she is dead to the outer world and belongs to the secret world of spies and assassins. So she has to create herself all over again, she has to follow certain rules, act in certain ways only to pass. Of course, at some point she is forced to change. She can't tell anyone what she does, not even her name. And that is quite difficult as our name and activity are usually the main keys that we use to define ourselves to the outer world.So what happens when you are stripped down from this luxury? Well, you become secretive, you have something like an identity crisis. You think you know who you are, other people think they know who you are, but those two do not match. And sometimes even the main character might become doubtful whether she is really who she is.All of us want to be different, remembered, we have our identity, and we never even think about what would happen if identity would be taken from us. What would we become? Constant actors or chameleons? I believe this movie greatly shows the development of character who is stripped down from identity and tossed into a new system. It shows quick change is needed to adapt, to create new identity. I believe it is impossible to be without identity. Even if there is an identity crisis the most probable solution in my opinion would be that the person would start creating a new identity. I guess it's in our nature. We have to show to the world: this is who we are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Admittedly this is a slick and stylish film, but in between the high spots, I found it to be long on exposition and dare I say it, almost boring. What was never developed well enough for me was the idea that this punk teenager/cop killer was deemed suitable to undergo an intensive rebirth as a government assassin. What elusive ingredient was part of Nikita's (Anne Parillaud) makeup that justified agent Bob (Tcheky Karyo) to go out on a limb to mentor her training? That whole part of the story was a disconnect for me, and kept rearing it's ugly head every time Marie/Josephine went into a sob over one thing or another. I offer that bathtub scene with the co-assassin who panicked to support my argument. I thought she was going to have a nervous breakdown right there. Well this one's been around a long time now, twenty years, and I finally got around to seeing it based on it's reputation, but I can't say that I was enthralled the way some of it's bigger fans on this board were. For some perspective, I went back and took a look at my review for that other Luc Besson genre film "Leon: The Professional", but that only confirmed my initial reaction here. The two hours can be spent better elsewhere.</fullReview>

And to me that is what sells the movie.The plot isn't really that interesting and a little thin. And the action isn't really all that amazing and doesn't really happen all that often.But the way they capture everything from rockets in kitchens to gunfire in panties and grocery store shopping was just cool.Oh yeah, the ending was perfect for the movie and for the character of Nikita.

From its opening scene it grabbed me by the scruff of the neck and it never let go. It also introduced me to the director Luc Besson. The fact that Nikita is a French film means that its much more harder to predict, when compared to your average hollywood thriller.The performances throughout the film are all excellent especially Parillaud. Some of the scenes in Nikita are so intense and dramatic they will have you gripping the arms of the chair either that or the person sat next to you.However Nikita is not without its flaws the final third of the film is disjointed and loses its way and the ending is very unsatisfying. But not even this can detract from what is the most stylish and dramatic thriller of the nineties. However please avoid the abysmal American remake entitled The Assassin (UK) or Point of no Return (US)and watch this version first or some of the impact of the scenes will be lost.</fullReview>

The French version of her "death" (OD) was set up more sensibly than what was presented in the US version (death penalty)... but then, French movies seem to suffer when translated to an American version (e.g, 3 Men &amp; a Baby). Perhaps the cultural barrier is as strong as the language barrier?Anne Parillaud is definitely more exotic than Bridget Fonda at every part of the movie (I'd describe Ms Fonda's looks more as "interesting" - although in the very positive sense that she inherited her father's better features - than "pretty").It is *crucial* to see a subtitled version (and even better to understand spoken French, to catch what was not translated in the subtitles... also a good exercise for language students); over-dubbed movies aren't worth it, and you lose what the casting director intended with the voices.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Because of the "genre" of this kind of film and also the way the actors play - with clear reality and precision - it is a "chef d´oeuvre" of its own. Let you convince of this and take after a good French (red) wine to make a good sleep! It´s simply a modern Hitchcock!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Point of No Return doesn't hold up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood made the same mistake with Shall We Dance. You take a good foreign movie, add a bunch of big name Hollywood stars and increase the budget by 50%, and in the end, you get a flop that is not as good as the original. While Fonda did a good job as the Nikita in Point of No Return, it is Anne Parillaud that clearly gives the better performance. While Point of No Return is an action film, Nikita is not. At times the movie has its action scenes but overall, this is a drama and a love story, not an action / adventure film. The difference that both movies have, the language, the cast of actors, the ending, make both movies almost completely different. Point of No Return is a movie where the actions speak louder than its words, while Nikita uses there words as its actions. You can have a love story without having to say: I love you. In Nikita, it is the story of a woman, reborn. While Point of No Return has the same storyline as Nikita, it lacks the true grit that made the original great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apsoulutely Classic, The Best Ever French Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS!NIKITA!SPOILERS!NIKITA!SPOILERS!NIKITA!SPOILERS!NIKITA!Firstly I must congratulate, "Luc Besson" (The Fifth Element) on his superb directorial work, also the part of Nikita is exceedingly well played, also the scene where she wakes up and asks "Am I In Heaven?". Anyway, Nikita is a 19 year old Junkie who robs a chemists with protecting guns and shoots a cop, by putting the gun to his head and walking out. Nikita is also the best action film of the 90's and beyond, only eclipsed by The Japanese cinema film "Ying Huang boon Sik" (A Better Tomorrow). Nikita trains to be a government agent, and falls in love with the guy at the supermarket. That is all very cool, but the last line is "Because I Love Only You", which is fine, but how can you make a series on how the film ends, anyway "Nikita" is a masterpiece (see stroke of genius), fantastic.One of The very Best Films Ever, ****/ ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick, stylish, amoral</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A street punk named Nikita (Anne Parillaud) is sentenced to life imprisonment after purposely killing a police officer. The French government fakes her suicide and starts training her to be a killer for them. She succeeds and they set her free. She meets and falls in love with friendly, handsome Marco (Jean-Hughes Anglade)...but the government keeps calling her to do jobs and she hates it. But she can't escape.... Some critics were horrified by this 1990 French thriller. The New Yorker magazine published a now infamous review of it by (I believe) Terrence Rafferty. The entire review was 9 words: "The end of French cinema as we know it." They were disgusted by the very strong violence and the total amoral tone of the film. Most were equally shocked with French film legend Jeanne Moreau doing a small cameo. It's easy to see why they hated it--it's loud, slick, violent...it's more like a French exploitation film masquerading as an art film. Still it was a HUGE hit worldwide. Art aside, this is a beautiful, fun, fast-moving thriller. There's no real depth to this film--we never know who Nikita's victims are or why they should be killed--it's just a very colorful glossy movie. Parillaud is superb as Nikita--she gives the part some real emotions that a lesser actress couldn't have pulled off. Anglade is very appealing as her lover and Teneky Karyo has some good moments as Bob, Nikita's trainer. Be warned--the film IS very violent and there's a real cruel view to everything here...but it ends on a very sweet, realistic note. Director Luc Besson deserves a lot of credit for writing and directing this. A great French movie. I even like the 1993 American remake "Point of No Return" and there was even a series of a few years on the USA network. The series changed things considerably but it was OK. Well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This may be one of the best films I have ever seen. It provides thrills and style, but contains haunting psychological aspects, too. It is an example of excellent character development. Nikita, the main character, is frightening in some scenes, and endearing in others. The lead actress gives a stunningly good performance. Every actor is great, no matter how small the role. Every character is a three-dimensional one. Nikita begins as a tough, unfeeling street punk. She remains tough throughout the film, but at the same time, she is a tender, passionate soul. I loved the romance story, it was sweet, but realistic. A brilliant, simply brilliant, film.</fullReview>

I also agree with other commentators that sudden time jumps (3 year, then 1/2 year) deserve a warning. In other films one put a phrase such as: "Three years later ...". With these minor problems, it is an unforgettable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I get really speechless when it comes to talk about this movie. If you see my list of comments, you can picture that I love Besson's work. "Nikita" is no exception. I saw this one with anticipation, and it was the last one i saw from his whole work. I read some reviews, and the good words about it excited me even more. The result when I saw it was pure bliss: this one has it all - laughs, tears, action, romance, you name it. And the greatest part is that this one is really french, even in its language, which gives it a much more european look and feel. This movie was also surprising for the change of pace and style for Besson, remember that his last movie was an poethic underwater chronicle, which, in comparison to this one, was a fairy tale. This movie would also spread the roots for one of Besson's greatest and universally aclaimed movies: Léon. I loved it till the end of the rolling end titles, to the sound of Eric Serra, who writes for this movie on of his most characteristic and beautiful dramatic scores. I love it and I will keep on loving it, hoping that more and more people see this movie, which (I have no doubt) marked a revolution in French cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As my above summary indicates, my feelings for this film are positive,except for the ending. Like most French films I've seen, the plot goes faster and faster until the end, where you'll be left saying "That's It??????????" Anyway, Anne Parillaud plays Nikita, a drugged out criminal who is given a chance to reform and become a secret agent for the French government. The government officer who she trains under is simply known as Bob, who is beautifully played by Tcheky Kuryo. When Nikita is released after a grueling preparation, she meets and falls in love with Rico, played by Marc Duret. Their tranquil romance is soon spoiled however, when she is called into service as an assasain There were some things that I found could have been omitted from this film, because they served no artistic purpose. Like when she gives the mouse to her computer teacher. ?????????? My only guess is that was to show how incredibly off the wall this character was and to further differentiate between her at twenty and her at twenty-three. There has also been some dispute over the graphic killing of the policeman at the beginning of the film. But a complete junkie who just saw all her friends got killed would probably do such a thing. Needless to say, if you don't like blood, you won't like this movie.  One thing I am not ambivalent about is the acting. Every single one of these actors carries their role off to a t. Kuryo completely and believably switches from the hard and stoic trainer to tender and loving when he is with Nikita. Duret plays with complete natural ease. And Parillaud shows such depth in her acting it's scary.  After that long-winded review, I don't really have anything else to say except this movie was one of the best Action flicks I have seen in a while. The acting was wonderful, and the plot was good, despite a very contrasting, subtle ending. 8.5/10. Feel free to email me with your thoughts or arguments. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another stylish Besson thriller with a salient message!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw Nikita back in 1992 at the movies. I have to say that I lost all interest once we see the drugged-up punkgirl, Nikita (wonderfully played by Besson's wife,Anne Parillaud) cold-bloodedly kill a cop begging for mercy.Even though she is sentenced to 30 years in prison and is then secretly "executed" we see her "reborn" as a Government agent. And even though we get to witness the slow metamorphasis from a 19yr old nihilist to a 23 year old professional killer, I still couldn't feel any sympathy for her during her "missions" to seek &amp; kill government targets if only because of her original execution of that cop at the start of the film.As a consequence I never really enjoyed the story, the style or content of the film until about 5 years later when I bought the video.Viewing it again the cop execution still bothers me, but the more times I watch the movie the harder I try to look at the reasons why Nikita did what she did and what she has now become under the guidance of government agents.Anne Parillaud, is quite wonderful as the troubled Nikita and really pulls at our emotions. She knows the movie audience out there will be baying for her blood after killing the cop so viciously; and yet she also knows that to be believable she has to play the character with so much depth, passion &amp; patience until that very same audience finally sees her side of the ugly world and that we can sometimes genuinely sympathize with her no-win position.Its a good film if you want to discuss the merrits of the death penalty: should cop killers be legally executed, or should they be given another chance at redemption?With Besson's Nikita, he chooses the latter but even though her life has been spared and she has slowly turned into a "civilized" woman from a punk girl, she is still the same person - a killer!The supporting performances are all very good with superb rounded characters who seem to play on the emotions so much.Tchéky Karyo, plays Bob, the Agent who has the difficult task of spending 3 years of his life training the rebellious Nikita to a standard of professionalism that will free her into society with a license to kill.The relationship between Bob &amp; Nikita is intense, ebbing this way &amp; that. Will they, won't they fall in love? If the script was given to a Hollywood director he would have gone for the latter, if only to placate &amp; appease the audience.Nikita then falls in love with Rico, (Marc Duret), an ordinary looking guy but with a great sense of humour and an optimistic view on life, directly the opposite to Nikita's past &amp; present views.Even though she has her freedom she still has a job to do, that of killing total strangers. But as she becomes more self aware and more deeply involved with Rico she finds herself being pulled in 2 opposite directions - to choose between Love &amp; Death.The ending is really quite sad but very subtle. The action sequences are typical Besson - slightly overdone but coated in a style &amp; chic.The script does stretch reality just a tad, but the wonderful soundtrack from the reliable Eric Serra soothes away our nagging doubts &amp; plot pitfalls.Overall then, Nikita is a very well made movie: a movie with a conscience that was so lacking in the American remake.If you're one of those people who support the death penalty (such as myself) then this movie will make you think twice about whether legally killing a murderer for doing wrong is any different from a reformed murderer killing legally: for me, I'm still undecided!****/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just another action film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you saw "Point of No Return" with Bridget Fonda, you owe it to yourself to see this film, "La Femme Nikita." While the two films are superficially very similar, the original "La Femme Nikita" has depth that the remake completely lacks.Anne Parillaud's performance is so strong she wouldn't have to speak a single line to convince us of the totality of her metamorphosis from a punkish, thoughtless killer, to a complex, yet sensitive and caring woman. More than anything else, this movie is a social commentary against the DEATH PENALTY. When Nikita (Anne Parillaud) recklessly pulls the trigger, ending the life of a policeman who is asking for mercy, I was demanding she be put to death. But almost immediately afterwards, Parillaud had me feeling sorry for HER! My feelings flopped back and forth throughout, but each time a little less back and a little more forward. Given a chance, an education, self-esteem, and her femininity, Nikita becomes a new and decent person; a world apart from the life she knew as a drugged-out punk.Don't miss this film! Anne Parillaud turns in an excellent performance that will have you on the verge of tears, if not wiping them away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this first rate classic the week it was released in the U.S. It blew me away. Luc Besson is one of the most talented film makers to ever come out of France. He is both visually and emotionally compelling as a photographer and a story teller. There is not ONE boring moment in this entire film. I never get tired of watching this tour-de-force. Besson is a master at contrasting moods: Intense, tragic, funny, silly, cold, dark, hopeless, hopeful, beautiful, profound, poignant, childish, "big brother", heartless, innocent, helpless, gorgeous, celebration... As others have already noted, forget the Hollywood remake called "Point of No Return". See the original masterpiece. Stay away from the English DUBBED version --ugh. See it in the original French with English subtitles. I could talk for an hour straight about the first-rate qualities of this film without repeating myself. If you hate French films, see THIS one. If you can't stand "European / foreign" films-see THIS one. If you've only seen the T.V. show-see the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film shines in all respects, but none so much as the soundtrack. Eric Serra's soundtrack adds more to Nikita than the visuals (which are outstanding). Just listening to the start of Tipokmop (from the restaurant scene) overwhelms you with a sense of fear, no... terror, and of an impossibly accelerating, out of control situation, flipping on a single beat into angry determination and resolve. All of which is carefully tied to the visual.It's also a film with very strong character definition. Apart from Nikita herself (her internal conflicts (and fear) are crystal clear, painfully so, without being trite), the handling of "the cleaner" is excellent; the character is totally deranged, but in a cold, horrible, utterly evil way- as if Luc Besson is giving us a quick peek of what Nikita herself might become ?Finally, it's a film where the psychological elements of the violence are wonderfully played out - instead of the usual gruesomeness inflation, this film maintains a very close lead on the feelings of the characters, and merely punctuates this with short instances of people being shot.Forget the absolute rubbish "the Assassin" - Hollywood could have learned a lot by watching this film instead of making their own version.</fullReview>

And as to the subtitles, I'd rather have them than some dreadful botched dubbing job.Then you've also got Jean-Hugues Anglade and Jean Reno in support, both matchless (How long has it taken Hollywood to discover Jean Reno?) and a fine performance from Tcheky Karyo to round the whole thing off.The action is non-stop, the character development is excellent (no flat characters here) and the plot has pace, covering several years of her life without the need to tell you it is doing so.Not going to give the plot away but if you find, buy it, but make sure its the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's the way it is in the stone-cold world of undercover assassinations (at least that's what they tell me...). This was and still is a great movie, about a drugged-up and punked-out French girl who murders people without hesitation. She gets busted, tried and convicted, and is faced with spending nearly most of the remainder of her life in prison, but then: mysterious dark elements of a secret French organization get a hold of her and ? by way of making her an offer that the Devil himself would have been proud of ? she consents to be turned into a sexy, sophisticated lady who... murders people without hesitation. All under state protection. Vacations included. (The wonders of plea-bargaining!)I first saw this movie shortly after it was released on video (wish I could have seen it on the big screen ? I bet it rocked, especially that awesome gun battle scene in the restaurant ? Nikita's first "hit"). I have watched it several more times over the years, and it still holds up pretty well, although I am amazed that I like the movie at all, because it has many elements in it that ordinarily would loudly signify "bad movie" to me. Such as:Namely, the lead characters (Nikita and Bob, played by Anne Parrilaud and Tcheky Karyo) aren't even likeable (I mean, they *are* after all cold-blooded professional killers. And Bob ? get a shave!). Secondly, the whole setup seems so implausible, what with some sort of underground "assassin factory" cranking out killers who roam around Europe... yeah, okay, next you'll want to sell me oceanfront property in Kansas. And the more I watch this film, the more some of the plot holes get too big for comfort. Like, for example, the boyfriend (Rico) never once has any physical contact with the workplace (hospital) that serves as Nikita's "cover". Most boyfriends, I think, wouldn't (for so long) be so out of the loop about where their girlfriends work.But these negative elements pale when set against the overall bigger picture that the movie presents. It's sort of like the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. Mainly because despite the characters' flaws (and obvious plot weaknesses) you somehow end up being completely swept up into the story, and caring deeply about all the players: they all seem so recognizably troubled, not just because of what they do for a living but because they are, after all, human beings. I mean, they don't just want to shoot someone; they also want to reach out and touch someone. (Hey, can we get a big group hug here? ? assassins included!)Anyway, it was and still is a great movie. I only hope it gets re-released for a theatrical showing someday soon so I can watch it in a big-screen format.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>****1/2 out of 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>French cinema gets a major jolt with this highly stylized thriller. Director Luc Besson is a man who works with style, be it the deadly serious (The Professional) or the deathly goofy (Fifth Element) either way he always has a distinct style functioning through out. This is the story of Nikita. We see Nikita at the start of the film as a drugged out addict who mumbles nothing more than "I need it." The hunt for drugs goes terribly wrong and she is sentenced to death by lethal injection for killing a cop, but deep down in the back of our minds we have to wonder if she even knows what she did. She is then given the needle but awakens in an entirely white room (Heaven?) and greeted by a man dressed all in black telling her that she is dead (God?), or so everyone thinks. That man is Bob and he informs her that she will be given a second chance at life if she trains to be a secret agent. As the film progresses and we seen Nikita's transformation you almost have to wonder if death may have been more merciful. When we hear the word secret agent we usually think James Bond, but this is anything but a 007 rip-off. It is a bloody action flick, a high tension thriller, a harrowing love story and a beautiful tragedy. I've said it about the Professional and I will say it again, this film owes more to Romeo and Juliet than it does to Goldeneye or Octapussy. The love story between Nikita and her fiancée is packed full of emotion and raw feeling just like your would expect from the French theatre. There is always one element in place that we cannot forget, Nikita is living a double life and her fiancée doesn't know about it, creating conflict between the two adding another layer of hardship to Nikita's life. A situation like this could be hard to make both romantic and thrilling but Besson handles it with style and grace. Besson is an expert at making action films with morals, films that will invigorate and entice as much as it will put you on the edge of your seat. Besson also throws in Jean Reno as Victor the cleaner (that's hit man for those who haven't seen The Professional) who acts as a heightened point on suspense but takes his role to such an extreme that he also substitutes as an outlet for dark humour. All of the actors walk around with droll expressions on their faces, like all of them have the power to be happy but all refuse to, part of Nikita's training it to learn how to smile properly. This raises the feeling of tragedy, never before have I seen a film where the way a character is portrayed is used as a method of foreshadowing. You get the feeling from the very beginning that this will not be a happy film and all of the actors show it on their faces and speak it in the voices, even a scene where Nikita kisses Bob and says "I will never kiss you again" depict the future of the film, this film is acted in such an artistic manner that it is almost a little to exhilarating to take all at once. This film keeps its action exciting, its suspense thrilling, its love passionate and its overall impact strong. IN other worlds this film packs one heel of a punch and there is no way a film like this could have been made in America or by anyone else but Besson. My only problem with the film is that the subtitles tend to clash with the backgrounds making them almost impossible to read, leaving the viewer to get lost in the films complexity, other than that this film is a true art form.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>La Femme Nikita has become one of my favorites. I like common elements and threads that Luc Besson uses in all his films: e.g. repeating words and phrases like "OK", "Good" and "Calm down." Nice and simple. And of course his movie openings very much the same, use of the same actors, etc. I just like Besson and of course love Anne Parillaud. Does anyone know if there is a "director's cut" of La Femme Nikita? The sequence of action looks constrained at times and I'd sure like to get the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent film about a killer babe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Nikita" is a French flick about a female street hood who offs a cop during a burglary and is subsequently shanghaied by the government and turned into an assassin. If the plot sounds familiar, it's because the film was remade three years later American style with Bridgette Fonda in the lead (Point of No Return). "Nikita" is a gripping saga which focuses on the painful existence of the principal, Nikita, who's torn by a double life; one she hates and one she loves. An artfully shot, well crafted slick semi-noir piece, "Nikita" stands head and shoulders above the American remake...a testament to the fatuous American appetite for film and Hollywood's desire to exploit it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty, exciting movie fable that is actually much better than its IMDb rating suggests.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched "La Femme Nikita" about 10 years ago, and it almost instantly turned me into a Luc Besson fan. This movie, and his later "Leon the Professional", are two of my very favorite movies. They walk the fine line between reality and movie-making fable, because in many ways we can identify with the characters, at the same time fully realizing much of what we see is implausible. But it is great entertainment, and Besson crafts his dialog and images so well that I believe many of his films, 'Nikita' among them, are destined to become classics.Now that I have seen 'Nikita' perhaps 5 or 6 times, most recently today, I am convinced of its excellence. What Besson has done in almost 2 hours is give us 2 interconnected 1-hour stories. The first is about the criminal Nikita, incarcerated, and given literally a once-in-a-lifetime chance for redemption. Refuse or fail and she will occupy the crypt that her family believes she already is in. The second story begins when, after 3+ years, Nikita completes her training and is given a new life with a new identity. But can she cope with it, always being on call as 'Josephine'? The opening scene sets the tone for the entire movie. Nikita, 19 and in a drug-induced haze, walks the streets in the very late night with her very rough buddies, one of them dragging behind him an unconscious comrade. Their task is to rob a pharmacy and get their next drug fix. We aren't given any backstory on Nikita but whatever it is, she has reached the point where her only ambition is the next fix.The theft goes bad, people are shot and killed, including policemen. Nikita is arrested, tried, and her life is gone. But in a special secret program she may be given a chance to work for the government as an assassin, among other things.Anne Parillaud seems so perfect as Nikita, and in her interview (DVD extras) she talks about how she literally becomes the character, and it shows here. Apparently Besson wrote this story specifically for her.The second main character is Tchéky Karyo as Bob, the man at the agency who sticks up for Nikita and assures the bosses that she is worth training. And the third main character is Jean-Hugues Anglade as Marco, the grocery store checker who becomes Nikita's love interest during the second half. In perhaps a role that eventually led to 'Leon', Jean Reno has a small but important part as Victor nettoyeur, the 'cleaner.' This is a superb movie, and relies more on character study than on action. Nikita has no inner conflicts as the movie begins, she just goes along and waits for her next fix. By the end of the movie, after she has known what love and caring feel like, she is full of conflicts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had not heard of this movie until after I had seen the remake with Bridget Fonda (kind of cool) so the plot had been spoiled for me. Being that I am not a French speaker I also had to use subtitles. The combination of these two downfalls made it only a so-so experience. I can say that the characters are much more real and much more developed in this movie. The relationship between Nikita and Bob is not only more present, but also well defined. Nikita wasn't as hot as Bridget Fonda, but in the action scenes she outperformed Fonda 10 fold. The cleaner brought the whole movie together for me as he is one of the best assassins around. Don't bother with the dubbed version, especially when you see the cleaner as the voice they give him made me cringe.</fullReview>

So I said "what the hell. It's only three and a quarter". Well... I normally hate the french just on general principles, but this flick grabbed me by the boo-boo! This film should be viewed by anyone who thinks that "hollywood" can do it better. The cute Fonda gave it a go but it doesn't work. Ann Parriauld is amazing, truly award winning, but she's french, and so she will never become famous in this country. Of course, if the general public had a chance to view the handcuff scene in "Innocent Blood"...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw Leon, having no idea of Luc Besson's talent, but after Leon, I just had to see more. So next in line was Nikita, and this movie is incredible. Most people, especially Americans, would expect to find action and explosions, which are in this movie, but not in the proportion that we are used to. (I am an American) Although some may classify this movie as an action thriller, Luc Besson never leaves his stories on one level. It actually carries a drama to it, with Nikita being set up for a job that she can't handle. Sort of a redemption story I guess you could say. Overall, the acting is very good, especially for Anne Parillaud (spelling?), who I believe won an award for this film, but check the database for that one. Of course Jean Reno does a great job in this film as Victor "the cleaner." Interesting to see him in this film to later pick up the same profession in Leon. If you ask me a very well put together movie, with Eric Serra (yet another man with a talent) backing up each scene with his musical score. Watch this movie carefully, there is much to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure, there is some action sequences which really are on a par with the best of John Woo; but this film is so, so much more than that. In the end, this is a subtle film about paying for one's sins -- and if perhaps there are some sins which can never be paid for in full. We get this in the form of an action-packed coming-of-age story of sorts with wonderful, unique characters and relationships. An exciting film, yes, but more so for its subtlety and touching ending (butchered -- as was the whole film -- by the American remake) than for its action. The style may be what one first admires, but, in my case, it was what was beneath the surface that stayed with me. A real surprise. Along with "Goodfellas", I'd say "Nikita" is the best film of the '90s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best thing I can say about "Nikita" is that it is the stock film I use to convert Friends to watching subtitled movies. The plot is a laughable one - but when you watch "Nikita" you don't even notice. Besson remains one of the most visually stunning directors in the business. Parilliaud and Karyo together are incredible with under-currents of emotion and desire barely visible but definitely sensed. Anglade is serviceable as the Clerk that Nikita falls for, but the award for screen-stealing goes to Reno as Victor the cleaner. Absolutely suberb. Awhile back a friend asked me if I wanted to see "The Assasin" - I declined. Without even seeing the film I knew what the Hollywood remake treatment was like and had no wish to see such an inferior movie. I did, however, check with all the Film reviewers in papers, etc that I think are normally worth a damn (I.e. not the SUN/Mirror, etc) and they were pretty much in accord. The best line describing "The Assassin" was "A carbon copy of Nikita, lacking any of the passion or tension"Nuff SaidDan</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Besson and the movies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm giving thanks once again to the older and experienced people, for letting me know about European cinema. On Saturday I got the chance to see Luc Besson's "Nikita", his first movie after "Le grand bleu". It's always strange the difference about the National audience and the International one. Luc Besson's films "Le Grand Bleu" and "Nikita" had lots of nominations for the César Awards and won some of them. However, "Léon", USA's favorite Besson movie (it figures in the #55 spot here on IMDb), didn't win any César. Although incredibly, Besson wasn't recognized as a director, until he did his first film in the United States, "The Fifth Element"; which got him his only Best Director's César, when he was one of the most important cinema icons in France.I'm glad Besson always works with the same crew and team. This could be inconvenient for some people, because they could prefer change. For me?This works perfectly. Today I was talking to my teacher and he described Besson as a commercial filmmaker, but not in his first features. "Nikita" qualifies inside the category of the first features, and it has got all the characteristics.An excellent lead: Anne Parillaud, I mean. Wonderful job! She absolutely understood the mix between sexuality and violence. Her character carries the film, and there wouldn't be a film without her performance. "What's your name?" , everyone's asking her. She answers: "Nikita". The changes her character suffers are not usual in a film. I said it, as it is: there's a different way in Europe with cinema. There's a different plot line; another way of making things. But saying it all over again would be useless; you should listen to it and see it; it's worth it. You just watch Parillaud during the film and be witnesses of what Besson is capable in terms of acting direction. Tchéky Karyo is superb as Bob, we know at the moment we see his face. He arranges important meetings that unexpectedly turn into assignments. Nikita doesn't understand it. "Why do you do this to me?", she asks Bob. "It is my way of loving". About love in this movie very much can be said. Marco really loved her and she never thought about it as they were together. She never thought much about Bob either. It was her own self hidden in the dark, for her and nobody else. Jean-Hugues Anglade gives Marco the perfect balance. Starting from the man a woman met a simple day and invited to her home. The naive Marco. But there's the other Marco. Violent and lonely.Again, and I imagine it hasn't stopped yet, Eric Serra delivers his magic in his magical score. In the first scene of "Le grand bleu" I felt his vibe; I got the way he was making his score. This is the same I felt with his score in "Nikita", but Serra managed to make me feel a different vibe. He surprised me with another kind of style, with more adrenaline, but again, perfect for each scene.Again (yes) the cinematography makes its own world and the script is kind of raw as it is real and honest. I said some time ago, but if the character can't say anything deep or complex it's because of its nature. Nikita's character is not the most intelligent woman in the world, although she does what she is requested to when she has to. Each character with its nature and each frame with its magic, and each line with is trueness, and Luc Besson; some of the elements that make "Nikita" a lesson about doing if not great, original and challenging film-making. Now what can you say about that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nikita: French Besson action with style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Nikita' is one of the best movie of the 90's. It is from start to end pure action with great stylish direction by Luc Besson. This man did some great films before he got involved in unserious projects later on, such as "The Fifth Element" and "Joan of Arc". Maybe the best scene in 'Nikita' is when Nikita (Anne Parillaud) gets a present from her boss ...Jean Reno has a small role (Victor - nettoyeur) which reminds a lot of his later title-character Léon, maybe Besson felt like that kind of character could be something more. While 'Léon' is a great follow up, 'Nikita' is just as good on it's own.Rating: 10 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most remarkable action films ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>La Femme Nikita is Luc Besson's masterpiece, and in my opinion even greater than Leon aka The Professional. Nikita stars Anne Parillaud as a young drug addicted criminal who gets involved in a deadly shootout and is sent to prison. She gets an unusual chance by government in order to stay alive. She has to work as an assassin for the government and she is trained to become the best..Nikita works with its great atmosphere, style and colors which all together make this one of the greatest action films ever. Besson directs so smoothly and has a great visual eye. Camera floats as if it was just a dream. The shootouts are often realistic and exciting and any minute you might get hit by an angry bullet..The violence is realistic and never gratuitous or stupid. It is a violent and ugly world in which Nikita (and we all) live in. There are couple of unforgettable characters here, and a "cleaner", a small role played by Jean Reno is among them. He plays a deadly assassin who cleans (=kills) for living, so it is similar role as in Leon, in which he starred. Also, Jean-Hugues Anglade, who played the sicko role in Roger Avary's Killing Zoe, has a supporting role in Nikita, but this time he is not bad. And the bad mo***fu*ka Tcheky Karuo, from Jan Kounen's Dobermann, is in Nikita, but not as near as bad as in Dobermann.The main theme in Nikita is the meaning and power of pure and beautiful love. *little spoilers* Nikita's dear fiancé is so deeply in love with Nikita, he doesn't get angry at all, when he finally gets to know what his spouse does for living. It doesn't matter, because love is the only thing that is important between them, and with love, all the problems can be solved. The killings Nikita commits make the viewer think that how it is possible for someone being entitled to kill other people for some "order" by higher level. Violence never can be justified and that's why Nikita also starts to feel sick after she's killed many (also innocent) people. *no spoilers anymore* This has same themes as Leon, but as I mentioned, I prefer La Femme Nikita, even though Leon is also a great piece of cinema.Highly recommended for the friends of intelligent and stylish action cinema which cannot be found too often from big studios nowadays, unfortunately.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit over-rated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to see Nikita as a movie in it's own right, since it seems so much like a dress rehearsal for the superior Leon. The camera angles are the same, the look of the movie is the same, the music is the same, it even features Jean Reno as Victor, a "cleaner" who kills indiscriminately like an early prototype of Leon himself.But Nikita falls down where Leon flew high on two counts: Acting and script. Anne Parillaud is shouty and annoying at the start and screechy and annoying at the end, and she's only just about likeable in the middle. Luckily, everyone else acts pretty much without emotion, which suits the blank, sterile look of most of the film.And the script is just ridiculous. It seems the French government sometimes give promising criminals a second chance by officially killing them, but really training them to be secret agents. And of course, psychotic, rebellious drug addict Nikita is just the kind of person who'd be good for that purpose, isn't she? Well of course she is, eventually. After a few months of ultra-cool action sequences, Nikita is given a top-priority mission involving some documents from an Embassy. But it all goes wrong in the end.One problem is that the script disorients time. We see weeks of Nikita being disruptful during her training, until, on her 20th birthday, she is told that if she doesn't shape up they will have to kill her after all. In the blink of the camera's eye, it's now her 23rd birthday. In one scene, she goes to bed with the supermarket cashier; in the next, she wakes up six months later without so much as a word of warning. I don't want films to start telling us every little minute detail, but a little bit of help wouldn't go amiss.Despite these gripes, it has to be said that some of the action scenes are brilliant, particularly the test in the restaurant and the sniper scene in the bathroom. But even these seem like a warm-up of scenes featured in Leon a few years later. Maybe the correct way to put it is to say that Leon is a rip-off of Nikita, but that doesn't stop Nikita from being way inferior of the two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high expectations because I liked Leon, or The Professional, so much, but this movie was just not as good. I rated it a 7 because of the stylish production and the great performances by the actors. If a movie with a fantastical plot premise is going to work for me, then the plot elements have to be plausible. I didn't buy the main character's reluctance to kill during the later parts of the movie. She had been completely nonchalant about killing and instinctively and unreluctantly violent at the beginning of the movie, and then she had been trained and indoctrinated as an assassin for 3 years. I suppose 6 months of looking at Jean-Hugues Anglade's disarming, happy/sad smile might have that effect, but I didn't buy it. I also can't believe that the French government would have tolerated its agents instigating all that shooting and destruction in a public restaurant, and I can't believe they would change their minds so quickly and order the killing a foreign ambassador. Another big distraction for me was that Anne Parillaud could not remotely pass for the age of the character--19 years old at the beginning of the movie and 24 at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with most of the comments that this film, from a cinematic point of view, was well made. The direction and acting were good. However, the bottomline of any movie is how well it tells a story. I had trouble buying the basic premise that the government would approach a recently convicted psycho murderer and decide it would be a good idea to train this person to be an assasin without any previous screening or training. How about we give Nikita a gun and put her on the street? Can we control her? Well, we did have a little trouble getting her to eat her vegetables, but what the heck. We'll just stay out of the way when the bullets start flying. As pointed out in other comments, this wasn't the only hole in the story, but it seemed to me it was the most important and no one in these comments seemed to catch it.I also thought the pacing was slow. Besson needed some better editing. I found myself dozing off at some points. I also didn't like the ending that left you hanging.I agree that Leon is a better flick for this type of movie. However, if you are a student of foreign films, or you think the look and feel of a film is more important than the story making sense, you will probably want to catch this one. I give it 6.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Trying to do magic instead of havoc'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an action thriller by Besson but shows a softer glint beneath the guns. A gun opens the night, fired by the heroine for no particular reason at all, a moment's whim but it takes someone's life, a karmic chain whirs in place. She then emerges inside a spyworld where she's going to be groomed to be the action heroine we expect, a figurative death has preceded.But something's off in this underground spyworld, the effort is not fidelity to genre. Her spymaster takes a birthday cake to her room, the room's walls are painted with scrawlings like out of a child's paintwork, this to underscore something we've been seeing for a while; a heroine who is childlike, irreverent, fragmented. Besson isn't propping here the cool silent image of the gun totting hero, he would later.I am reminded here of Ruiz's drawings of internal landscape using genre ink dipped in mirrors, he would later use Parillaud in a film I've seen called Shattered Image. A whimsical irreverence as she flummoxes instructors in the academy, this is all ostensibly under the pretense that she's being groomed to be the genre character but it's also the entry to what's beautiful here. Different portraits of this girl, the journey is to womanhood as a woman advises while doing her makeup, femininity as growing into and exploring your role.The role expects pain, as all roles do. There's a love affair, schematic but this is to quickly set up a next life where she has her own life that she shares, one of spontaneous gestures, joy that just wells up from breakfast in bed - nothing like the soulless Angelina Jolie products that explain plots. But what do we see of that love, what pain threatens? An ordinarily happy one but suddenly being yanked by doubt; 'Josephine' on the phone, and she has to drop everything and sneak out for the spy story where she has to pretend to be someone else, in Venice she has to worry about shooting a target while her man outside the door pours out a confession. Here nothing is really explained of the missions, we figure it but the point is the intrusion of a hidden self, the spying as doubt.I don't get from it the coercion and oppression of a beautiful spirit by society, this would turn her into merely an icon of purity. I see all this as the same obstacles, outlandish here to thrill ourselves on the side, that every life has to face as it struggles to realize magic in the havoc, truth in the duplicity of life.Ultimately Besson promises a better film than he eventually delivers, because the promise is masterful but requires an even more fluid hand; I imagine a threehour film in the hands of Rivette who gave us Celine and Julie about girls confronting the responsibility to a role. A third shift has her disguised as a man in hat and coat, abandoning her femininity to snap images of meaningless documents. The ending is poignant, we never really truly know what casts the shadow, this is even before shooting the gun, we're never told where she goes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, very good movie, good performance by Parillaud, worth watching. But what I really want to talk about is this:Years ago I saw Point of No Return, the U.S. version of Nikita. I remember reading on movie boards the opinion that the remake was utterly worthless, just a shot-for-shot copy of the original, but I enjoyed it. I did wonder how it would compare with the original. Now I finally have, and have a vague comparison to make, vague because it's been ten years since i saw Point of No Return.I can understand why people like Nikita better. Parillaud conveys an animal intensity in the role that I don't recall from Bridget Fonda's performance. The movie has a gritty feel to it and I recall the U.S. version being more Hollywood slick. I like both gritty and slick, really, but based on my vague recollection of the U.S. version I would say it did not have the impact of the French movie. On the other hand, I recall being very struck by the scenes of the U.S. version involving the Cleaner, and really, I wasn't that impressed with the French one there. In fact, I thought the movie sort of lost it in the last 20 minutes or so. I just didn't buy it in the end. I don't actually recall if the U.S. one ended on a more likely note but whether it did or not, I would still say Nikita's ending weakens the movie as a whole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Concept: 'My Fair Lady' meets John Woo meets James CameronThis has something of a cult following for foreign action fans. I can understand why given the prestige of the director, but 'Nikita' doesn't have anything new to show the world. American studios must have thought importing directors was a great idea; how else do you explain Besson, Woo, and Verhoeven getting into Hollywood at about this time?The acting, even for a French film is daft and contrived. Only Reno succeeds because little is asked of him other than occupying space. That's all he knows how to do and Besson takes advantage of it. He is, of course, a variant of Chow Yun-Fat's "Killer" character originating in the first 'Better Tomorrow.Besson himself is not devoted to his images the way Spielberg is (thankfully), but here he over-emphasizes everything. Constantly I am reminded of Cameron's 'Terminator' in the pacing rhythms, use of lighting, and especially sound design. Art for exploitation's sake.What got me hooked was the not Besson's contribution, but Serra. Serra takes after the Cameron/Fidel techno idea and runs with it. It is this reinvention of music that gets points from me. While techno in Hong Kong films is awful, the Europeans understand the genre. After this came 'Lola Rennt'.Unfortunately for 'Nikita', when all is said and done, 'Léon' did a better job of constructing characters from the environments (especially Reno) and had a cast that understood living in different worlds. Besson also got more experimental. Here the only experimenting is done by Serra.Final Analysis = = Midrange Material</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Luc Besson's fame as a director is certainly justified. However, he deserves less praise as writer of the scripts of his movies ( and of others, which he usually produces ), because the development of his basic ideas is often full of holes. Nikita is no exception. Two examples := Nikita goes to Venice, unaware that she shall have to kill a woman; she could have been in a place other than her bedroom when ordered on the phone to do so, immediately ; and the first task of the Italian police shall be tracing the trajectory of the bullet: so I suppose that she shall have to get away as soon as possible ( and how to explain such a haste to her lover ? ) = When she is given the mission of stealing documents in an Embassy, her Boss insists it must be done smoothly; but when the plan is to be altered as the consequence of a change of code at the Embassy, she is ordered to go on, but now with the help of a clean-up man, Victor; the first thing he does is to kill everybody but Nikita, including the Ambassador (!!!) and the latter's would-be impersonator ( Agent Jules )... smooth doing, indeed; it is left to Nikita to impersonate the Ambassador, with Victor as a driver ( nobody questions the change of the usual driver by an unknown one ); and it is no longer question of the overimportant change of code, by the way...etc. When you see the movie, Besson's virtuosity prevents you from noticing all these holes, but afterwards, if you think it over ( and you have a good chance to, because the film is really impressive.... )you cannot help but becoming aware of them. ************ The IMDb file on Nikita lists the cast as they appear on the screen: so RiCO ( Marc Duret )is not Nikita 's true love ( as written in many comments ), but the two-gun leader of the drug addicts who attacks the drugstore ; MarCO (her love ) is played by Jean-Hughes Anglade ( "Killing Zoe" and "Maximum Risk", a Van Damme film )... the choice of the names could have been better.</fullReview>

What feeling,I think that Nikita make the movie so free that you almost believe this is happening "Live". French movie, Luc Beson this is quality.Shes close to be a soldier who fights for integrity and for the human freedom while she claime up the stairs to respect and acknowledgement.I don't know if it would be good with a second movie. Time have passed and it's twelve years ago, so how does she look like today comparred to 1990. Nevermind this is one of the top 10 movies at all times.Be aware - Be prepaired - for a meeting with true actress - improvised - and timeless, a cult and one of it's kind.Thanks for the warm a delightfull experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favourite movie of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I say this is my favourite film of all time, that comment is not to be taken lightly. I probably watch far too many films than is healthy for me, and have loved quite a few of them. I first saw "La Femme Nikita" nearly ten years ago, and it still manages to be my absolute favourite. Why?This is more than an incredibly stylish and sexy thriller. Luc Besson's great flair for impeccable direction, fashion, and appropriate usage of music makes this a very watchable film. But it is Anne Parillaud's perfect rendering of a complex character who transforms from a heartless killer into a compassionate, vibrant young woman that makes this film beautiful. I can't keep my eyes off of her when she is on screen.I have seen several of Luc Besson's films including "Subway", "The Professional", and the irritating "Fifth Element", and "Nikita" is without a doubt, far superior to any of these. Although this film has tragic elements, it is ultimately extremely hopeful. It is the story of a person who is cruel and merciless, who ultimately comes to realize her own humanity and her own personal power. That, to me is extremely inspiring. If there is hope for Nikita, there is hope for all of us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most innovative action thriller of the 1990s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the 50 or more French films Ive seen, this is certainly the best. And of the 100 or more action films (international included) ive seen from the 1990s, it was also the best. Why? Because it actually was original. A Paris street junk addict turned elite assassin. Of course now its success has been sickeningly copied by gravy train riding hollywood producers, from Point of No Return (an awful american remake) to CIA: Code Name Alexa (crafty but familiar), and of course the horrible nikita hour long tv show, which is surviving on the USA cable network by the skin of its teeth. Luc Besson's directing and Eric Serra's invigorating music are an excellent combination. Tcheky Karyo deserved a best actor Oscar for his cool portrayal of Bob, the benevolent but mischievious covert operations director. Anne Parillaud had her moments, but her annoying screams and masculine demeanor dampened what could have been a flawless peformance. Jean Hughes Anglade, who played Nikita's boyfriend Marco, was also oscarworthy for his clever, quiet character (unlike the wimpy and unfit Dermot Mulroney in Point of No Return).Prospective viewers should not be deterred by the foreign language of the movie, the subtitled version is excellent and possibly better for not allowing the dialogue to distract from the fabulous nonverbal acting. It's simple, compact screenplay is also perfect for those learning or wishing to learn the French language, which often seems uptight and restricting. So get the VCR ready, dim the lights and prepare for a rare cinematic thrill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This tour de force, guided by the sublime hand of Luc Besson, deserves recognition for - if nothing else - the masterful way the director has taken an unoriginal storyline into a slick, stylish and deep movie.The acting throughout the cast is excellent and perfectly understated - the performance of Tchéky Karyo particularly outstanding as the mentor Bob. The soundtrack, largely by the French composer Eric Serra is a complementary undercurrent. Plaudits must go to Luc Besson for maintaining some masterful direction that in no way was mimiced successfully in the uninspiring Brigit Fonda remake - The Assassin. It has none of the soul and pace of the classic original.It is a real shame that the film is so hard to get hold of in the UK, and it is highly recommended that anyone with an appreciation for the work of a director should try hard to get hold of the film from Europe.Lastly, please do not watch the film in English - you only end up in losing part of the atmosphere that makes Nikita an enduring classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh dear. A film that is hailed as a "classic". But I'm afraid it doesn't live up to its hype. There are plenty of problems with Nikita, and the gravity of these, in this modern day, outweighs its good points. The main problem is the story itself. The government decides to fake the death of a mentally deranged murdering drug addled junkie, in order to spend years training her to become a covert operative/assassin. Erm ... of all the people to chose from, they opted for that? Didn't they have any applicants?O.k. We'll try and move past that and get on with the film ... only to find that the film doesn't really get on. Nikita settles down with a man, and then occasionally gets assigned jobs. However, these jobs are not particularly interesting, nor are they numerous enough to let quantity make up for quality. Then the film ends, after a "climax" which offers nothing of interest, and then leads to a bizarre end. I watched the credits arrive and I honestly thought I must have accidentally skipped the DVD forward by 10 chapters. Where's the rest of it? When's the good stuff going to start?The film just doesn't know where it is supposed to be going. Is it an action film? Is it a film about a woman trying to change her life? Is it a film about the strengths of feminine guile? I'm not sure even Besson knows, and this shows in the fact that it seems to explore a few angles at various points in the film, but doesn't cement any of them, so you really don't get inspired by any of the options for discussion.Perhaps 20 years ago the flaws would have been hidden somewhat by the "exciting" style of film making that Besson employed. But since many many films have copied this style since, you will be watching nothing new.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing Point of No Return (a great movie) and being told that the original was better, I was certainly thrilled to see that one of the indie film channels was running La Femme Nikita. Then I saw the movie. Ouch! This was a major let-down.Nikita herself reminds me of Jar Jar Binks more than any other character I've seen recently. She comes across entirely as comic relief. The movie simply has nothing to recommend it besides the core concept of an evil, inhuman character paradoxically learning to be human while training as an assassin, and that concept failed miserably in Nikita due to the poor writing of the title role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having read some of the positive reviews I was looking forward to this film but I was sadly disappointed. It was quite well made and the story is a good one, however the main problem with it is the casting of Nikita herself. Anne Parillaud just doesn't convince in anyway that she is either a drug addict or a trained assassin. Her portrayal of a drug addict seemed to consist of her screaming and acting in bizarre ways and as an assassin she just never looked like she could beat anyone in a fight or fire a weapon effectively. I know some of the purists decry the TV series but Maggie Q was a much more convincing Nikita in my view.</fullReview>

The advertising even seemed weird, comparing this film to "Lethal Weapon". Huh? The best part was probably the casting of Jean Reno.

		<shortDescription>Here's my take.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Point of No Return vs. NikitaPoint of No Return made me have a crush on Bridget Fonda for a week, while Nikita left me with a whole lot more. Point of No Return (remake of this film) was a typical American action movie, it was a good action movie, but it was missing the emotion that this one had. Harvey Keitel played Victor in Point of No Return, while Jean Reno does that here, Reno played a cleanup man (think Leon with emotion, he even laughs!), while Keitel played a killer with suitcases full of acid. Fonda plays Anne Parillaud's role of the criminal turned government killer, Fonda's character looked anemic, while Parillaud's looked downright sadistic. Even the lovers act differently; Fonda and Mulroney were great together in Point of No Return, Parillaud and Duret looked better together, not to mention more realistic. Besson (the director, writer) and Parillaud were married at one time, so that could be why this film told the story better.</fullReview>

Tcheky Karyo and Jean Reno were absolutely magnificent. Two of the brighter spots of the movie. And now, here's an interesting Did you know: the first time this movie aired in Croatia, after the war, in that last short scene, where Nikita did her last mission, was obvious that it happened in the embassy of the former Yugoslavia.

		<fullReview>It doesn't matter how good the acts are, it doesn't matter how good the production is... If the screenplay is faulty, everything is at fault. La Femme Nikita had every single potential element to be a classic and even cult movie but the screenplay failed the whole thing from the very beginning. Why the French secret service recruited Nikita in first place? A junkie (Dark grey almost rotten teeth) murderer of a policeman who proved to be completely insane as they could not even let her in common ward in fear of her causing harm to other inmates, basically a sick persona who belonged to mental hospital rather than a prison. Granted that they wanted a killer walking dead to do their dirty and most dangerous job (I'll emphasis on this subject later) but the killer ghost is not supposed to be the crazy untamed animal as Nikita was. The whole Idea was a child's dream, a very big defect in screenplay from the very start. As the movie continues, we see no development in Nikita's training as an assassin. First she does not cooperate and then all the sudden she decides to cooperate because she realizes that she has only 2 weeks to prove herself worthy but we would not see what happened in next 2 weeks and in reality nothing can happen in 2 weeks but anyways, couple of vague scenes follows and then we see her at her 23rd birthday, 3 years passed and we saw nothing of her training and her character development from that early wild animal to a classy lady assassin. It appears that there is a romance going on between her and Rico but that's just a guess from the following acts so I wonder what's the point of making a rated R movies if it's supposed to appear like a PG-13? Another gross failure. Now let's see how is she doing as an assassin/secret agent. I hoped to see something extraordinary to compensate for the previous failures but no! nothing. Her first job is to deliver a bugged plate to a room in a hotel. Her second assignment is to shoot a lady with sniper rifle. Really? did they go through all that to recruit her to do these kind of jobs? and then comes the embassy mission. Again a gross failure in development of the story. 6 months to plan for a very simple mission made complicated. The whole idea of kidnapping the senior diplomat and impersonating someone else as him was one big joke aside from the fact that it doesn't make sense for the secret service to plan 6 months on a mission as basic as that. Anyways, that mission was supposed to be the climax of the movie but still the question remains. Didn't they have normal decent agents to do this job? and at the end she leaves/escapes. leaving her fiancé behind and of course a final confrontation between to lovers/supposed to be rivals and that's it. Actions never justified the causes. The whole thing became a big joke. I would say there was entertainment value in the movie to some extent but it was a cheesy B movie at its best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>La Femme Nikita is the story of a young woman who is given a second chance to become a decent human being in society under a new name and persona. The catch? She must also work for the agency that gave her this second chance as a top secret assassin. This brief synopsis alone made me expect much more from this movie than I was given. Especially when the likes of Luc Besson (Leon, The Fifth Element) is directing and writing. La Femme Nikita is unfortunately missing the impressive edge I've come to expect from Besson.The film starts out well when we are introduced to our protagonist, Nikita (Anne Parillaud). She is an over exaggerating, rambunctious, loud individual who hates everyone around her and does not have a problem shouting death threats at every single person in the same room as her. She's a fun character to watch and Anne Parillaud does a fantastic job at playing her tormented and insane role. After she is arrested and her death faked, the government agency that takes her in begins to rehabilitate her so that she can be reintegrated into society as a normal person (save the whole government assassin bit). As we watch her character begin to form we are left waiting for the actual goods to be delivered. Yet I felt like they never were to their full potential. I constantly felt I wanted more than what I was being given.For the most part, La Femme Nikita lulls, especially through the middle. It picks up at sporadic points, only to fall back down again. I found myself not quite as engulfed in the story as I thought I would be, and most of the time I was waiting for something to actually happen. I expected a riveting ending and thankfully this was mostly given to me with the entrance of Jean Reno's character. It picked up considerably with some intense action backed by Reno's fantastic portrayal of the calm cool and collected hit-man. There is one final conversation between two characters that ends the film and I did feel satisfied after that. The ending gave the entire movie some redeeming qualities, but didn't completely make up for the lackluster middle.By now I feel like I've given the impression that I just plain didn't like this movie. That's not true. La Femme Nikita isn't a bad movie, it just lacks where you'd expect it to excel. Luc Besson is a great director and writer and you can tell by watching La Femme Nikita for what it's worth. There are some very well shot scenes, some great exchanges between characters, and a story that isn't amazing but it is still there and it's still relevant. All these great elements are just so sporadic that they don't carry through the film as a whole, they only stand out when they are present. La Femme Nikita is still a decent film, it just could have been so much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How could I have enjoyed Nikita 20 years back? I was much younger and I was only beginning to get interested in movies so all the tricks worked.Besson makes movies for teenagers like him, for adults who refuse to grow up. Not because the adult world is too complex and dangerous, and he'll never again be a naive young boy (that is Spielberg's nostalgic stance) but because he is stubborn and intellectually challenged. "It's a tough world out there but I don't care because I was always this child living within his fantasies" and he never grew up and got a lot of success and made a lot of money, got to live with beautiful girls and got respect from powerful people.Nikita looks so fake today, nothing rings right. The look is so 80s, the characters so flimsy... The opening sequence is ridiculous and then the continuity is only based on poor little screaming Nikita. This lack of substance rapidly becomes annoying, even more so as Tcheky Karyo reads his scarce lines. With Jean Reno he is the kind of strong-faced and dumb actor, a poor-man's Clint Eastwood who kills without a wink but is so fragile inside (ah-ah): the typical Besson hero.Nikita was much hyped for its visual prowess. Well, there's really a nice surreal &amp; futuristic look in the settings but the directing skills only make the script appear more dumb and vain. Besson has always made movies for teenagers and this is a good business. He is a smart businessman with a visual eye, but no more skilled than a video-clip director and none of his movies will stand the test of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"La Femme Nikita" spawned an American remake and a television series. And, it's correct to say it's a bit of a cult film and a lot of folks like this film. Well, I liked it...but didn't love it mostly because of some logical problems early in the film. Still, I recommend you see it because the story is quite original.The film begins with a very violent and senseless crime. Some druggies break into a pharmacy and soon a bloodbath ensues. The police arrive and several of them are also killed. One of the druggies survives and is indicted on several counts of murder.Throughout the next 20 minutes or so, the surviving druggie, Nikita, behaves like she is either psychotic or possessed. She is nasty, violent and completely antisocial. Not surprisingly, she's sentenced to a very lengthy prison term. However, something odd happens--her death in prison is faked and she wakes up in a training center for assassins and spies. This is a neat setup but really made no sense. If the government was going to recruit assassins, a woman who seemed very emotionally disturbed and possibly mentally challenged seems like a bizarre and nonsensical choice. Making her less weird, whacked out and more obviously intelligent would have explained their selection process--and selecting Nikita seemed strange. If you can look past all this, the film get VERY interesting once she leaves training and tries to establish a dual life--a conventional woman with a boyfriend AND a secret killer! To me, the last portion was far better--and made much more sense. What happens next? See it for yourself--it's a decent little thriller.In many ways, this film reminds me of an earlier film "Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins"--though, oddly, the setup for "Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins" was much better BUT the mission portion was terrible. With "La Femme Nikita" it was the exact opposite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>La Femme Nikita is one of the best action/thriller spy movies to come out in the 90's. Luc Besson became a name upon moviegoers lips from that moment.From the films brutal introduction to nerve racking ending, this film is, in my opinion, one of the greatest commercial french films. A great deal of people believe that French films have to be boring or art house. Well this movie has adrenaline but also has a interesting imagery to it. the characters and supporting characters are all stylish with each underlining imagery that go with them.Example. When our heroine goes on her first mission she meets her team. The team is filled with men with earings, dreadlocks and even ganger looks. These agents do not resemble the clean cut, tuxedo wearing James Bond. there is also a mixture of cultures which i find refreshing.Even the action is stylistic. Luc Besson created the camera POV of the bullets trajectory (which was i believe was stolen by Robin Hood : Prince of thieves 1991).La Femme Nikita is much better than its boring American remake POINT OF NO RETURN ( the movie was good enough to be shown in the States without having to be remade).I Recommend this movie to whom ever are in the mood for a good story and a great set of action sequences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After years of knowing the hype of this pic, I finally decided to view it. Director Luc Besson had been responsible for one of my favorite movies of all time, Leon (The Professional), so it had to be good, right? NOT! It was one of the most boring and unintelligible few hours of absolute tripe I have ever seen.Firstly, the character of Nikita (or Marie, or Josephine, take your pick) is rather annoying and seems a hysterical split personality; one moment laughing and dancing, the next crying and screaming, the next composed and cold-blooded. Anne Parillaud does a really poor job as the title character, and has the screen presence of a stick. Her handler, played by Tcheky Karyo, interacts poorly with her and everyone else in the movie. He seems to be modeling stylish European suits.Her jobs of killing are all idiotic and absurdly far-fetched. But worse, none seem to make any basic practical sense. The worst is the last which has Nikita dressing as a male diplomat to penetrate a fortified embassy with the criminal-looking Jean Renot. One can suspend disbelief just so far, but this action was unintentionally comical.If you must see this crap due to its rep, be prepared to have difficulty staying awake and avoiding laughing. A truly poor effort all around, made even worse by being in French with subtitles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit I watched the TV-show first. After seen all the episodes and being thoroughly impressed I decided to watch the original film. To be completely honest the film left me wondering if that was it. The main characters of the film, Nikita, Marco and Bob are brilliantly played and the writing for these characters is amazing, but the story didn't effect me at all. To have a great movie on your hands you need a great story that feels like it HAS to be told, characters that interest you and actors who fill up the parts like they seemed to be destined to play these characters. This film got two of the three right, but the story felt random and not very believable. The real highlight was how Nikita changed. In the beginning she simply didn't seem to care about anything and came across as if she grew up in the woods, but as the film goes on you see a woman emerging and in it the irony that it took a job as an assassin to make her human.All in all, I sadly have to disagree with most of the comments. The TV-show is still dear to my heart because they captured the concept so amazingly. But if you want to see some top-notch acting, the check this film out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie vs TV series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie because I am a huge fan of the TV series of the same name starring Roy Dupuis and Pet Wilson. The movie was really good and I saw how the TV show is based on the movie. A few episodes of the TV series came directly from the movie and their similarity was amazing. To keep things short, any fan of the movie has to watch the series and any fan of the series must see the original Nikita.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Nikita's Too Thin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Nikita's Too ThinUnlike the `Nikita' (as in, former USSR premier) and, like it's leading lady, LA FEMME NIKITA is too thin to be as fully satisfying or thought provoking as it could have been. As written by Luc Besson and as played by Anne Parillaud , Nikita is a whiney, drug addicted psychopath who murders a police officer in cold blood, even though she has virtually no chance of escape. Even during incarceration, Nikita ruthlessly maims an interrogator. She is sentenced to life with no possibility of parole for 30 years.CAUTION: SPOILERS AHEAD.When Nikita finds herself being summarily executed by lethal injection, she cries out for her mama. This cowardly behavior was found repugnant in the days of Cagney and Bogart. Here, I suppose, it is suppose to arouse sympathy for Nikita. It doesn't work.Nikita awakes to find that her execution and burial has been staged, and her new mentor, Bob (Tchéky Karyo) recruits her for work as a spy / assasin. Bob gives her one hour to choose: Either work for us or be executed for real.Using a ruse, Nikita attacks Bob and, taking his weapon, uses Bob as a shield in an attempt to escape. When her plans are foiled, Nikita attempts suicide, but Bob has left the first chamber in his gun empty. Reclaiming his weapon, Bob shoots Nikita in the leg as a lesson. This is the first scene in the movie I actually enjoyed.Entering training, the cruel, unruly Nikita physically injures one trainer and emotionally injures another. Bob finds out from Nikita it is her TWENTIETH birthday. Bringing Nikita a cake, he tells her she has two weeks or she'll never see 21. Visiting her `feminity' instructor (Jeanne Moreau), Nikita begins to learn to use her feminine gifts. After finishing her makeup, throughout which Moreau says, `You are going to be very late!' Nikita goes to celebrate her TWENTY-THIRD birthday with Bob! After three years, the only apparent changes in Nikita are that she is slightly calmer (Ritalin?) and has learn to brush her teeth, comb her hair and apply makeup (your tax francs at work?)Her birthday celebration outside the facility (which she hasn't left in three years), turns out to be an assassination in a public restaurant. This is the best action sequence in the movie (and Parillaud performs many of her own stunts). However, it seems pretty silly for an `expert' spy to leave a `novice' spy to commit this kind of mayhem in such a public place.It gets worse. Once Nikita escapes and returns to the spy compound, making no attempt to hide her tracks, Bob tells her that she is `free' and that the organization has set her up with a cover. Right, she has just slaughtered over a half dozen people in a public place and she is free to go settle down. What, is there no police force in France (I guess Nikita killed the last cop in the beginning). Nikita then becomes domesticated and settles in with a sweet boyfriend, Marco (Jean-Hugues Anglade). Things are going swimmingly for Nikita until the `nasty organization' asks her to do a few more jobs, each one more ridiculous than the rest. One asks us believe that Nikita could shoot a woman with a high powered rifle from her motel room and have no police come to investigate. The last would have us believe that Nikita dressed as as a male diplomat could ride through the gates of an embassy with a heavily armed hit man whom looks nothing like the real ambassador's driver without being questioned. It also asks us to believe a car can crash through a solid brick wall and keep on going.Near the end of the movie, Marco, whom has discovered whom Nikita is, debates with Bob about the moral equivalency of Nikita's assassinations of enemies of the state with her murder of the innocent cop. Some have argued this movie makes a strong statement against capital punishment. I disagree. Nikita may no longer be as rebellious, but she is every bit as dangerous at the end of the movie as she was at the beginning. She NEVER shows remorse for the cop's murder, and always seems only concerned about saving her own skin. Her only sacrifice seems to be abandoning the two men she loves. Will Nikita again become the foul, ruthless, drug-addicted `wild child' of the streets. The liberal conceit that `society made her that way' and that, "love and financial security will save her" fails to take into account the Robert Downey Juniors and O.J. Simpson's of the world. Certainly external forces DO shape us, but they don't make us whom we are. That kind of wooly-headed thinking is why so many FAVOR capital punishment. That is, in order to prevent nitwit social scientists from inflicting the same murderer on us TWICE. Besides, the organization would track down and kill Nikita to protect itself from exposure. Nikita would understand. After all, the organization would be playing by HER rules.This movie is wrong headed from the start. Luc Besson's trademark `flying dolly' opening shot into strutting drug-addicted criminals does not work here. Drug addicts, particularly those planning to rob a store would skulk, not strut. Thin stuff, indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wacky empowerment thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An unrepentant junkie punk in a nameless, near-future city (designed from the same blueprint used in 'A Clockwork Orange') is arrested and programmed by an elite undercover organization to be the Total Woman, trained in close combat, firearms, computer skills, make-up, and housekeeping. Her mission is to assassinate a series of anonymous VIPs (whose crimes are never explained), and no less an expert than Jeanne Moreau teaches her how to apply cosmetics, with as much skill as she wields a gun but with more attractive results. The whole idea behind this ultra-modern French thriller would be insulting if it weren't so ridiculous, but the tongue-in-cheek absurdity proves to be a saving grace. The plot veers madly back and forth from tender romance to grisly violence, but except for the understated charm of boyfriend Jean-Hughes Anglade the emphasis is more on cold, often superfluous style: there's even a POV shot from a bullet in mid-flight. All that plus travelogue footage of Paris and Venice, in yet another continental attempt to copy popular Hollywood role models.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leon was a fluke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leon the professional (done by the same director) is my favourite movie of all time, so I had high hopes for this flick, but...this is utter dreck nothing in this movie makes any sense, dozens of questions are never answered: e.g. why is Nikita (the name isn't used for 90% of the movie even though the film is named after it) executed? why does she have to learn art and dancing in order to become an assassin? why can't she all of a sudden bear killing people anymore when she never cared before at all? why doesn't she try to quit the assassinating business? why does Nikita cry all the time? who is she working for: Heaven? Hell? why does she leave her fiancée in the end? nothing makes any sense and the corruption scene (which is completely redundant in the course of the movie) is the most repugnant I've seen in some time, the quintessence of this dreck scene is "Woman should be men's plaything" I honestly did not expect such tripe from Luc Besson who wrote the divine Leon the Professional the soundtrack is the single worst I've heard in my life, you can find better music in porn movies (save for the few scenes that had Leon-like music) all in all, this could have been a good movie, if certain things would be more developed, like Nikita's sadness and anger; certain scenes cut, the whole soundtrack replaced and an alternative ending filmed, but as it is, the movie cannot be saved by a fan edit, so I will never watch this again shame on you, Luc Besson</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How disappointing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being that the only foreign films I usually like star a Japanese person in a rubber suit who crushes little tiny buildings and tanks, I had high hopes for this movie. I thought that this was a movie that wouldn't put me to sleep. WRONG! Starts off with a bang, okay, now she's in training, alright, she's an assassin, I'm still with you, oh, now she's having this moral dilemma and she can't decide if she loves her boyfriend or her controller, zzzzz.... Oh well, back to Gamera!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a whitewater rafting trip; very exciting overall but a lot of slow parts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The rowdy guys in Rochester had another "Violent Movies For Men Who Like Violent Movies" (VMFMWLVM) gathering the other night. The movie selected was "La Femme Nikita". Overall, we liked this movie. They do an amazing job with Nikita's transformation. The violence was outstanding.Unfortunately, the overdubbing left something to be desired. The movie definitely loses something in the translation. The dialog is not that good, making for a lot of slow scenes.One interesting side note comes from a scene where we can see that Nikita has been taking art classes. She has apparently brought paint back to her white room and covered the walls with graffiti. This movie was filmed in France; all of the dialog was originally in French. Ironically, all of the graffiti in her room is written in English. This would have been a hard one to pull off with "overdubbing".Give this movie a shot. It's better than any television reality show, even if it's not in the same league as any Quentin Tarantino movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so stylish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stylish thriller? Hardly! This French action film from director Luc Besson is more confused and unsure about itself than anything else I have seen recently.The opening action sequence shows some promise, and the following action sequences are good. However they are sadly too few and far between. The drama is dull and erratic, and the characters are generally unlikeable. Anne Parillaud and the support cast are unable to involve the audience emotionally."La Femme Nikita" ends up more like a try hard, B-grade action thriller. Very average!Saturday, April 28, 1991 - Balwyn Cinema</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do you speak French?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If not then stay away from this thing. It does not translate at all. Jeez, you would think we'd at least get an accent or two considering that the setting is obviously somewhere in Europe? Anne Parillaud plays the killer in desperate need of a breast enhancement. The French guy from The Patriot plays her opposite, very convincingly too if you turn off the sound. Incredibly, this movie is much better in French without the subtitles. Better than a sleeping pill. 5/10</fullReview>
