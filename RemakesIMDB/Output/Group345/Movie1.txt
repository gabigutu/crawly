		<shortDescription>average movie, but great acting of Bridget Fonda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a remake of Luc Besson's "Nikita" (1990), this is quite an average hollywood remake of a very interesting french movie. The french original is much better in terms of direction and story, but Bridget Fonda's acting is marvellous, outstanding and considerably better than her french counterpart's in "Nikita". And this is exactly the reason to watch this movie, Fonda's performance is a thing you should definitely not miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Violent, stupid but enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, it's a bad remake of La Femme Nikita--yes, it's overly violent and amoral (but so was the original)--yes, it's REALLY stupid, but I enjoyed it. It moves quickly, Fonda manages to give out a pretty good performance and it's certainly never boring. If you can turn off your brain, and sit through bursts of graphic violence (and a really sick sequence involving Harvey Keitel as "The Cleaner") you should be able to enjoy it. No great movie, just a really good bad movie. Critics predictably hated this movie. There's a now infamous review from the "New Yorker" magazine that's only 9 words long--"The end of French cinema as we know it." Ignore them--this is lots of fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The English version of the French movie La Femme Nikita. I think it is quite well done, and I enjoyed it.A druggie girl kills a cop and is sentenced to death. She is given the "opportunity" to live, if she does what they say, and becomes an assassin. To the rest of the world she died.She is determined, and she doesn't play well with others, but if she doesn't start playing their game, she really will be in her grave.. I'm not giving away any more.But I would recommend it, it's worth seeing. Especially if you like Bridget Fonda, who kicks arse in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this flick was good, and I'm SO glad that the film didn't resort to the typical Hollywood ending that other American remakes do (though it differed just a bit from the original "Nikita").Admittedly, I'm biased in that I'm getting to be a big Bridget Fonda fan. And I agree with another reviewer that Fonda played a more likable character than the one in the French original.Plus, the DVD's sound is great, though the picture is grainy.All in all, a good film that doesn't deserve all the mudslinging it has gotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb acting and cinematography let this Nikita remake shine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen the French film, Nikita, on which this is based, but it sounds superb. What drew me into this film was the presentation of the story, which focuses less on her as a professional killer and more on her humanity. In the French film, Nikita looks very forceful and aggressive. Fonda in "Point" seems more sensitive and feminine. I'm just going to have to see the French one. I'm not easy to impress and this film drew me in. Nikita must be awesome.BRIDGET FONDA has a face one can just stare at for hours. It's a restrained performance. She plays a very conflicted character full of paradox. A proposal from her lover cause tears to well up in her eyes as she peers down the scope of her rifle at her latest target. She manages to keep a straight face when her friend is killed in front of her. She even manages a smile and says, "I never did mind about the little things." Fonda has such talent that she's able to portray pure calm with every muscle in her face while her eyes swim in terror and heartbreak.HARVEY KEITEL is Victor, the Cleaner. His face is a stone. No smiles, frowns, or grimaces. He is heartless and emotionless. As he kills, his face remains stone cold. He says no unnecessary words. His answers are short, to the point. Superb. His performance is understated brilliance.GABRIEL BYRNE has a knack for making his characters believable. He's harsh, yet sympathetic. He alone makes this movie worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excellent example of Hollywood's ability to ruin a good movie concept. The original version ('La Femme Nikita') was far more gritty and realistic. The main character is offered a choice between death, or the life of an assassin. As such, she spends most of the film trying to find a way out of her situation. Unfortunately the overuse of high-tech props, sets and special effects have made the entire experience so sanitised that by the end of the film I found myself wishing that a corrupt government would come and kidnap me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Point of No Return", or "The Assassin" as it is known here in Britain, is, of course, a remake of Luc Besson's French thriller "Nikita", and keeps closely to the plot of the original, although the action is transferred from France to America. Some of the names, such as Victor or Amande/Amanda, are the same as, or very close to, those used in the original film, although the name of the main character is changed from Nikita to Maggie. (Besson had, for reasons best known to himself, given his heroine a masculine Russian Christian name). Like Nikita, Maggie is a criminal and drug addict who murders a policeman during a raid on a pharmacy, a crime for which she is sentenced to death. The sentence is, apparently, carried out soon after the trial, but in reality Maggie's life is spared. (The film-makers ignore the fact that in America any death sentence is automatically subject to a lengthy series of appeals and reviews; in California, where the film is set, only thirteen people, out of nearly seven hundred sentenced to death, have been executed during the last thirty years). She is given the option of being trained to work for the Government as a professional assassin; if she refuses she will be killed and buried beneath the tombstone which already bears her name. Roger Ebert compares Maggie to a modern-day Eliza Dolittle, the heroine of Shaw's "Pygmalion". This may seem an odd comparison, given the nature of the work Maggie is being trained to do, but it is in fact an apt one. The modern assassin must master not only martial arts, weapons skills and computer technology but also such matters as deportment, polite conversation, fine dining and the art of looking beautiful. The rationale is presumably that, as Maggie may be called upon to kill members of America's high society, she needs to know how to behave in their company. The tuition she receives is obviously effective; Maggie enters her charm school with the social graces of an alley-cat and leaves with those of a débutante. For all her poise and glamour, however, she also has the skills of a ruthless killer. The Government resettle Maggie in Venice Beach where she poses, under an assumed name, as an IT consultant and finds a boyfriend. Occasionally, however, she is called upon to take out a target whom the Government want dead, either by delivering a bomb to their hotel room or shooting them dead in the street. At first she is happy to go along with their instructions, but begins to develop a conscience about what she is doing, and wants to leave her job. The idea of remaking a modern foreign-language film in English and with an American setting was anathema to many purists, particularly to those (on both sides of the Atlantic) who see Europe as the home of High Culture and America as a land of vulgar Philistines who are too lazy to bother with reading subtitles. This, however, was a view which I found unfair, as "Nikita" did not lose much, if anything, in translation when it was remade. Contrary to what some might think, not every French or European film is an art-house classic; Besson's was a commercial thriller which was itself influenced by American models, especially neo-noir. Film noir, as the name might suggest, has always been appreciated in the French cinema; the influence of Besson's model on John Badham's film might be seen as France's repayment of its debt to America. Moreover, "The Assassin" has many virtues in its own right. It makes effective use of music; there is a memorable score from Hans Zimmer, possibly influenced by David Hentschel's music for "Educating Rita". The soundtrack also features several songs by Nina Simone, a particular passion of Maggie's. (This seemed a rather conservative taste for a young woman of her generation, but the explanation is that Maggie's enthusiasm derives from her mother). Bridget Fonda (who has clearly inherited the classic good looks of her Auntie Jane) is very good as the heroine, both as the anti-social rebel of the early scenes and the sophisticated, seductive young lady of the later ones. There are effective cameos from Anne Bancroft as Amanda, Maggie's tutor in the social arts, and from Harvey Keitel as Victor the Cleaner, the ruthless, deadpan killer called in to "clean up" when one of her jobs unexpectedly goes wrong. There is a larger contribution from Gabriel Byrne as Maggie's handler, Bob, a key role as the relationship between the two is a complicated one. At first Bob is only able to handle her by making veiled (and sometimes open) threats about what will happen if she does not co-operate, but later he grows close to her, almost like a substitute father. (She passes him off to her boyfriend as her uncle). He is sympathetic to her desire to leave her job, but his hands are tied by the attitude of his superiors. As a thriller, "The Assassin" is a fast-paced and exciting one, but it may also have a deeper significance as a critique of the death penalty. Maggie's development parallels that of Burt Lancaster's character Robert Stroud in "The Birdman of Alcatraz", who also starts off as a vicious, conscienceless killer and gradually grows in humanity There is an obvious irony in the fact that she is sentenced to death for murder and that her life is then spared so that she may commit further murders on behalf of the State that has sentenced her. The further irony is that it is her career as an assassin which teaches her the value of human life. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you can get past the brutality you might enjoy it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This IS a really brutal movie-I usually don't like violence in movies but in this case the violence was sort of neccessary for the overall subject at hand. Once I got past that, I really enjoyed this in a way that surprised me because it wouldn't be the type of pic I'd usally watch.I think Gabriel Byrne is what made this movie. He was great as Bob and the chemistry between him and maggie/Nina was overwhelming. I think this was a movie made good by the cast. I thought Fonda and Byrne were incredible.I wouldn't call this "dreary" as much as sometimes brutal with alot of violence. Still it's a good movie, I think besides the incredible chemistry between Byrne and Fonda the story was moving and makes you want to know what happens nest.Harvey Keitel was positively creepy as the Cleaner! There are some really-well- for lack of a better term icky scenes in the movie but the acting is first rate and holds your attention.There are some negatives to: to much violence that seemed kind of for shock value, after awhile it becomes a bit much:ok we get the idea. The AMMOUNT of shootings, explosions etc detracts from the wonderful acting and powerful story at hand, they could have minimized the brutality A LITTLE.Also, Gabriel Byrne and Bridget Fonda should have had more scenes together, their chemistry is what made the movie. I understand, looking at imdb comments that this is a remake and I didn't know that before, but although this movie is very engrossing it doesn't get up to 10 status. Stil, it's defintely worth seeing if you have a strong stomach and haven't seen it.</fullReview>

Bridget is slim and elegant and the transformation is quite fun to watch. It's like watching a supermodel action star.Supporting cast are really well cast. Anne Bancroft makes a brief but memorable appearance. Gabriel Byrne adds some stature. Dermot Mulroney is charming. Harvey Keitel is effectively chilling.The Nina Simone songs are great background.

		<shortDescription>Moving and nail-biting remake full of action from popular French film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>US thriller finely directed by John Badham about a violent junkie who becomes undercover assassin . Exciting and stirring movie that was formerly adapted in French style by Luc Besson , dealing with an once-amoral street urchin become into a gorgeous woman of sensitivity and depth . A gang of armed drug-addicts break into a shop to try and steal drugs to fuel their habit and then takes place a bloody tour of force . However, the police arrive too fast and all addicts but one are killed . The hardened criminal (Bridget Fonda , role previously acted by Anne Parillaud and Bridget was cast after Jodie Foster and Winona Ryder turned it down) , a punk-junkie sociopath acts with consistence violence , even in police custody and is given a life sentence . Having killed a cop when the theft gone awry is condemned to death row but she is reprieved by a strange organization . After being drugged by her captors she wakes up to find that she has been spared in order to train her as a government assassin . However, top-secret agency official (a Svengali alike ,Gabriel Byrne , interpreted in the French version by Tcheky Karyo and Antonio Banderas was considered for the role of Bob) arranges a stage , so she can be elaborately trained as phantom killer and subdued into obedience in order to enroll in a governing finishing school. After a dramatic transformation in which she is trained in etiquette , she is allowed to leave and start a new life for herself . On her eventual release she turns into a sophisticated girl thanks to an old lady (Anne Bancroft , role also acted by Jeanne Moreau) . As a cover, she gets a new identity and with a new beau , all the while carrying out agency-mandated assassinations. And with a wonderful house-mate, a broad-minded, gentle boyfriend (Dermot Mulroney , previously performed by Jean Hugues Anglade) . The two fall in love, but that complicates jobs. His good influence extends to breeding her a conscience that puts love over business, alas unlike agency. However, she begins to discover that there is more to life than she previously thought and soon begins to wish she could escape from her obligation. But the government aren't so easy to evade .This exciting noir-thriller is packed with thrills , tension , suspense and lots of noisy action . From start to finish the action pace is fast moving , provides fast and furious entertainment with spectacular scenes . This is a stylish and particular version of Pygmalion by Bernard Shaw , including a master played by Gabriel Byrne and his disciple performed by Bridget Fonda . Displays nonstop action and is extremely entertaining and thrilling . Some scenes are brutal and with a load of violence. Still it's a good movie, I think furthermore the incredible chemistry between Gabriel Byrne and Bridget Fonda ,the plot was moving and intense , it makes you want to know what happens after . Bridget is pretty good as the heroine who turns in violent tendencies to patriotic use , both as the anti-social rebel of the early scenes and the sophisticated, seductive young lady of the later ones ; a bitterly ironic moral evolution for a contract killer . It benefits enormously from a memorably assured performances such as Miguel Ferrer as Kaufman , Anne Bancroft as Amanda , Olivia d'Abo as Angela Richard Romanus as Fahd Bahktiar and Harvey Keitel as Victor the Cleaner . In addition a cameo by the same director John Badham as a room-service waiter . Atmospheric musical score by Hans Zimmer , though with excessive use of synthesizer . Colorful cinematography by Michael Watkins and perfectly remastered , including his cameo as last guard at the gate during the escape. The motion picture was lavishly produced and professionally directed by John Badham with his ordinary visual pyrotechnics but with no originality , being a simple copy from original film ; having directed one episode of recent Nikita series . However , Luc Besson declined the opportunity to remake his French hit Nikita. Other versions about Nikita character are the followings : ¨Nikita¨ series produced by Jay Firestone with Peta Wilson , Roy Dupois , Matthew Ferguson and Alberta Watson ; and Nikita (52 episodes, 2010-2013) with Maggie Q , Shane West as Michael , Lyndsy Fonseca and Aaron Stanford .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film isn't perfect-I'm the first to admit this. There are so many things that don't make sense. However, I candidly admit that I love this film. Why? Well, it's slickly produced, well shot, juicy, colorful and I can't help but love Bridget Fonda's performance. She just played this part perfectly. Ann Bancroft played her part well too. In fact, all the actors did a good job here. I can't imagine anyone else in those parts. Yes, some of it is unbelievable and hard to swallow but if you just want something entertaining to watch this is good. If you want everything here to make sense or want explanations for every single detail then you will probably be disappointed. So, just watch it and enjoy it for what it is. I can think of MUCH much worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is obviously an American translation of the French film "La Femme Nikita", and upon first viewing, the movie was just "okay" at best. However, a second viewing changed that opinion and makes one realize that there is more to this movie than just trying to duplicate an older version. The way in which the actual story of the film is concluded is fine, but so many other aspects are left open creates a stunning contrast. The music is also very well done, mainly due to the lovely vocals of Nina Simone. Another aspect that I enjoyed was the shift in conflict from Maggie vs. herself to Maggie vs. everyone, and then Claudia vs. the system. It is easily said that the rehab and training program did too good of a job in the movie and gave her morals she didn't have previously, but it was this fabulous job that created the second half of the film. All in all, this movie deserves more credit than it is usually given, and if one can get away from the comparisons to "La Femme Nikita" then I think appreciated better.</fullReview>

We all know this was a remake of Le Femme Nikita the TV drama and it has taken a lot of negative criticism but i thought it was perfectly cast and written really well. Bridget Fonda plays the main lead and she is great. There are lots of fight scenes and it really keeps you on your toes throughout . We have a love interest in there too which leads the film on nicely. I love a film that has a grand finale and this certainly does. Bridget is such a great actress that she really makes you care about the outcome of her fate towards the end Great movie and definitely one to watch</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"no return" says it all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't think for a moment that this film establishes, let alone delves into, the conflicts and diametrically opposing aspects found within our protagonist, Maggie (Bridgit Fonda). Instead, "Point of No Return" is all over the place, this because of the screen-scrivener's apparent use of stream of unconsciousness. Consequently, there's no return to reality (if there was any from the start) once this train's left the station. Indeed, the film's a mishmash of conflicting scenarios: "She's a psycho!" "No, she's a tender-hearted lost soul." "She's a man-eater!" "No, she's a fragile child." "She's a seasoned siren!" "No, she's only now in the throws of first love." And, so, on and on the celluloid chugs. See, presently, femme fatale Maggie, the "Assassin" (title in the UK), enters into training as a kill-joy for the US government. How she got to that point is truly ludicrous. And worse is fact that a third of the movie is wasted in failed attempt to establish as believable her two-dimensional "transformation" (it's maybe better to think in binary terms: "0-1" transposed into "1-0").Moreover, Maggie, in seeking out to silence each target, kills numerous others. Talk about collateral damage. Innocent victims stack up into the dozens! And why, in the first place, is she after those targets? Except in one, truly lame, "nuclear" instance, no reason's given.Not to be lost in translation here, however, joy can be found in the cinematography-- whether a scene be subtle/tender or full-throttle, or, for instance, in instantaneous scene swipes from the steely still to the crazed. And there's also the sure-handed talents of Fonda and Gabriel Byrne (as Maggie's handler), who provide reason for why anyone ever considering a return to this heavy-handed material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was intrigued by this film from the very beginning.I have appreciated Bridget Fonda's acting ability since the film Scandal where she played the stunningly attractive Mandy Rice-Davies so I would probably watch it for that reason alone.However she plays a highly complex character with an iron will and carries her role off with the similar ruthless efficiency of her assassinations.She appears to be in a no win situation even though she has escaped death by execution. There is the nagging doubt in my mind that this technique has not been used by "authorities" at some time.The idea is just so clever that it is almost as though it couldn't be thought up unless it really has happened somewhere.I know little of the background to the film so I am unsure how the idea originated.An intriguing film and very involving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bridget Fonda does well in this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another member of the Fonda family does her duty well. In "Point of No Return" Bridget Fonda plays Maggie, a killer drug addict who gets a second chance in life by the Government. After her sobering ordeal, she shows her crass, yet subtlety through training, in which she may not come back at all. When she makes the most out of life, the only thing she like was the singer Nina Simone. If she looked like hell when she was on drugs, Nina's music seems to make her more level headed. When she wore that dress to the dinner, she was indeed deadly. And the way she moved, no one could keep up to her. I liked the way she went down the laundry chute to avoid the rocket. And the Mardi Gras scene, a killer classic. Getting through the crowd, using all the fighting skill against those Cajun thieves, that's wild. Assassins are always going to be stealthy, but one wrong move, and you're done. The romance scenes were not heavy, yet the passion level is always going to be heavy at all times. A very good, yet resourceful movie indeed. Great cast, great plot, and an ending that would be hard to believe for everyone. Rating 3 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

Action junkies could do a lot worse at the rental store.It's interesting how readily this translates from the French. The lifting of scene by scene impressed me with how similar Washington is to Paris. In fact, some of the action seemed more plausible in Washington than Paris. It might even be fun to try and figure out which French locations match the U.S. ones.Still, given a choice - rent La Femme Nikita.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe I should have seen the original instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is only average, and it's only even barely average. As an action movie, it's pretty weak. Only one actual shoot-out sequence, and too much Hollywood in the other action scenes; huge explosions, overuse of slow-motion, etc. As a drama, it's very weak too. The drama doesn't really turn up in the movie before the second half, and after that, it's nearly constant. You nearly forget that it is supposed to be an action-thriller. It got very boring after the charm of the first thirty minutes of the movie, and after that you pretty much just sit around, waiting for it to end. Which is very bad, even for a relatively bad movie, it should be able to keep your interest beyond the first fourth of the movie. The only thing that kept me watching, was hoping for another shoot-out like the one early in the movie. That was the only thing the movie has going for it, that and the lines Fonda said. Those were truly great; I don't think I've ever experienced that much provocation in a female role, and Fonda did a great job on that. However, I have no doubt that the original(made by Luc Besson) is better. So, if you want to see something like this, you should probably check it out instead of this. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview> I've never seen "La Femme Nikita", so when I saw "Point of No Return", I had no point of reference by which to judge the merits of the second film as a worthy re-make of the non-American original. I just watched the movie. I really like this film. I can suspend my disbelief for 2 hours and just enjoy the incredible premise for what it is. I thought the supporting cast was fine, including Dermot Mulroney as J.P. As the film went along, I was drawn in and was never tempted to switch channels (I saw it uncut on some premium channel). I wanted to catch every scene. Which brings me to the main reason I find this totally implausible movie hard to pull myself away from: Bridget Fonda. It's that simple. In this movie, she'd get my vote for the most irresistible woman ever filmed. Absolutely gorgeous, whether she's wearing a business suit or just her own skin. She plays her part perfectly: I particularly like the scene where she's in the supermarket trying to buy food like an actual everyday shopper. Another good scene is when "Uncle Bob" comes to dinner and the tension builds really well. With this movie alone, Bridget Fonda gives me the best reason I've ever had for buying a large screen television. I might try and catch "La Femme Nikita" sometime, somewhere. Maybe. As for now, I think I'm pitifully hooked on the re-make...but that's not bad at all. Movie: 6/10 BFonda: 11/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a disappointment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is also called The Assassin. I have never seen the original, Nikita, from Luc Besson, but I was looking for it, instead I stumbled on this film in the rental store and it turned out to be a remake. I thought, with Bridget Fonda as a gunslinging babe, plus Gabriel Byrne and Harvey Keitel in the supporting cast, and in the director's chair John Badham, of Wargames, Bird on a Wire and The Hard Way fame, what can go wrong? Everything!The camerawork is plain mediocre and not any action scene seems to have any choreography, the whole movie lacks style and elegance while it should have those above everything else. I think, if it would have been a good movie, every scene would have been either very thrilling and exciting to watch or involving. The scene with the arrest in the beginning and the training scenes could have been so much better with a little imagination. The same for the other "action" scenes. The whole movie is very uninspired and a huge waste of talent. For those who like the chix-with-guns genre, which still seems a bit underused, I recommend The Long Kiss Goodnight with Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson which is far superior and has a better plot to boot. Or if you want to see a really good film with Bridget Fonda go watch A Simple Plan.I give this film 4 out of 10 because it had so much more potential. Were it a B-movie I had been more forgiving, but it wasn't. It was, however, executed as badly as a B-movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bridget Fonda is groomed as an assassin by Gabriel Byrne</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen the 1990 "La femme Nikita" and liked it. I like this version too. Bridget Fonda is perfect in the role of a murderous delinquent who is taught to be a government assassin and looks for a way out. Gabriel Byrne is always good; here he's her guide. Anne Bancroft is well cast as her teacher of social skills. Dermot Mulroney makes a believable lover for Fonda after her training concludes. Miguel Ferrer is the outfit's boss. He's always effective. And Harvey Keitel has a small role as a cold-blooded and efficient "cleaner". He definitely looks and acts the part. Bridget's the center of the movie, though, and she does a marvelous job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bridget Fonda gave a magnificent performance as Maggie in this suspenseful thriller. I'm currently watching the recent TV series NIKITA and thought it would be cool to see the original, but downloading the trailer of the Luc Besson film, I just decided no way. I had seen this movie POINT OF NO RETURN when it was first doing its pay-channel rounds, but now, watching it on DVD, and looking at it with NIKITA hindsight, I really appreciate it. Every nuance of the fine acting by Bridget was just now slurped up... She is both harsh and soft, vulnerable and volatile, excellent casting. She gave a lot to the character, but that's her pedigree showing. After all, she was in a stinker of a failed movie a couple of years before, LEATHER JACKETS*, in which she managed to shine despite the whole thing being a sunken ship before the voyage even got under way. An action movie with a complex female lead. Compare this to regular cardboard character (male) action heroes! *my regular followers are shaking their heads. He's talking about LEATHER JACKETS yet again!Bridget Fonda's eyes are what makes POINT OF NO RETURN great! Added to that, she is very light on her feet, and moves like an elegant yacht. Look at her when she comes up those stairs in the restaurant assassination scene.Another interesting bit is how it is clear to me that Quentin Tarantino watched this movie back there in the video shops. He later cast Harvey Keitel in a similar role, no, rather an over- the-top celebration of this in PULP FICTION, and Bridget was in his JACKIE BROWN, complete with a bare foot soles scene (just more elaborated on) such as around halfway in this movie. And coincidentally, Bridget's character's name in LEATHER JACKETS was Claudi, here Claudia is an assumed name. Also, in the recent TV series we have Maggie Q playing NIKITA who was at least in part inspired by Maggie Hayward. And, by the way, Bridget was named after Bridget Hayward, born out of her father's first marriage. Okay, silly trivia, I will shut up now...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting performance from Bridget Fonda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've only just discovered this movie and wonder how I've missed it before. I gather from other reviews that it's a remake of a french film 'Nikita' but being ignorant of this original picture I can only say how much I enjoyed this American re-make. I don't really care that a lot of reviewers are comparing the two, so for me, Point of No Return or The Assassin as it's sometimes called gripped me from the first frame to the last, hence my 8 stars. It's such a loss to cinema that Bridget Fonda hasn't made a pic for 12 years because I definitely have a crush on her after watching this and Lake Placid just recently. She reminded me very much of Jodie Foster in this movie and she's my all time favourite, in fact just the sort of thriller that Jodie might make. Bridget plays a soulless killer who is given the death sentence, only to be reprieved by sinister government officials, in order to train her to be a government assassin. Gabriel Byrne also gives a good performance as the main government agent who gradually warms to her. I'm not sure in reality that these sort of people can feel love like normal human beings but if you make a movie you have to find some empathy with the characters or you'll alienate the audience. Harvey keitel and Anne Bancroft add to the star power and the only weak character I thought was Dermot Mulroney as a rather hapless love interest for Bridget. The movie is generally pretty fast paced throughout with plenty of action and violence, but really at the end of the movie, all I could think of was Bridget Fonda.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bridget Fonda is the best thing about this shallow action picture, a remake of a far more successful French movie. She plays Maggie, a drug-addicted cop killer, sentenced to death, who is saved from the gallows - well, the needle - by shady Government operative Gabriel Byrne who offers her a shot at redemption by becoming an assassin. So sense of realism isn't exactly its strong point.Where The Assassin differs from many other action movies is that it chooses to focus more on the difficulties Maggie encounters as she attempts to assimilate into society after completing her training. Apparently, she never bought food in her previous life because, confused by the choice in her local supermarket, she simply follows another shopper and loads her trolley with dozens of whatever they buy. Strange that Byrne's agency would equip their pupils with all the skills necessary to kill anybody but not to maintain their cover in the outside world. Anyway, that's just one of countless inconsistencies that aren't really important given the context of the entire movie. While on her shopping expedition, Maggie meets J. P. with whom she begins a relationship, and it's the conflict between this relationship and Maggie's secret life with which the film concerns itself.Truth be told, that side of it isn't particularly interesting, but Fonda and Mulroney work well together and their scenes with Byrne's 'Uncle Bob' are well handled. But it's with the action sequences that the film feels most comfortable. Fonda also manages these scenes well, and Harvey Keitel makes a welcome - albeit late and all too brief - appearance as a ruthless cleaner whom she must defeat if she is to escape life as a Government assassin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me, it's perfect except that it's a remake. I have seen it more than 15 times, and it only makes me feel more deeply about it.About the plots, it's provoking at the first, touching at the middle, and echoing at the end/afterward. The casting is fantastic too. Brilliant Bridget Fonda's talent and her gorgeous, cold looking helped her play the role greatly. And Gabriel Byrne! His performance is so touching and subtle, in fact, I think he almost overshined Fonda. Dermot Mulroney and Harvey Keitel also did well on their roles.There are so many classic scenes that can taste it over and over, again and again. Just like the kiss after the final test, "I'll never kiss you again..."(GOD!!!) And the Bob's frankly "No" after Maggie's asking for helping her out. And, of course, the final scene. It's so deep that I feel it gives me too much but I am not wise enough to afford all of it. The soundtrack is great too. Nina Simone's leisurely BGM, Hans Zimmer's ending theme...all of them are so pleasing. Especially the ending music. In fact, it's now playing here in my computer. I can't find out how to make it better by all means.Watch it now, just now. You will never be disappointed, I swear it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This exciting thriller may be an Americanized version of John Le Carre's Le Femme Nikita but it definitely stands on it's one two feet. It has everything a great movie needs; a great script, a very talented cast, and a solid plot.Bridget Fonda shines as a drug addict who, after killing a cop in a drug bust, gets the death penalty. But after the "execution", she wakes up in a secure facility and is met by a man (Gabriel Byrne) who gives her a choice: become a paid assassin for the government, or die.After accepting, she is taught everything she needs to know to be a good assassin. Her life seems to be everything she could hope for. but then she realizes that her life is not her own and she longs for freedom.Anne Bancroft's role as an etiquette tutor is one of the highlights of the movie and Dermot Mulroney is wonderfully sexy as Fonda's love interest.This is what a good thriller should be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whats the point of no return?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On watching the Bridget Fonda and Gabriel Byrne, version of the classic Nikita film, I just felt that it lacked gusto, grit it felt very American may be I'm comparing it too much with the French version.If I saw the US version and not the French, then I would say it is a great film which it is, lots of money spent on it, bright contrasting colours nice rounded characters. Only problem was ending! Fonda's a great actor and she pulled it off very well and in her own thinking, I would say she has seen the original and tried to create a different feeling for the original Nikita Character, Kudos to Fonda. As we all know it was a successful film that it sprouted out a series with Peta Wilson, which funnily enough brings back a bit of the original no nonsense of the french version.The US version is a great movie has it's faults like any other movie, only thing is it should not have been made, because I think the Luc Besson version is far superior. French have been known for their great visual aspect and cinema-photography and it shows in the French original. Plus the Eric Serra sound score is superb.I have seen the original French, the Dubbed English French, the US Fonda version and the TV series. Also I can say is Watch the original after the US version. You can easily make up your mind. If one saw both films US and French and was unaware which came out first they would instantly tell the French is the Original and the US is the Fake.</fullReview>

I've heard from many people that the original is much better. I want to see it, but considering the fact that I've never seen a decent non-American film by American film standards, I'm not holding my breath that La Femme Nikita will be the outstanding masterpiece people are making it out to be.Some people think that the bathroom sniper scene was just an excuse to show everyone Fonda's panty-covered ass, but in my opinion, that assumption is pretty silly. In order to keep millions of people from complaining about things like this, you'd have to wrap the female star of an action movie like a damn mummy for the whole film. When Tom Cruise and his co-stars all stripped down to their briefs in Top Gun, millions of women came flying to the movie theatres to watch an obviously male oriented action flick. When Kate Winslet exposed herself in Titanic, feminists didn't say much, because it was a great romantic story and very tastefuly done. But oh no! Put a woman in an action flick and all of these feminists become nuns! Gimme a break.</fullReview>

All the above are verified taken into consideration that you have seen the original film La Femme Nikita by Luc Besson. I am saying this because Point of no Return is nothing else but a chip remake of the original one. As far as the directing is concerned it is alike to Besson's one. In my opinion remaking a directing with the same way is something stupid. Bridget Fonda performs badly in contrast with Anne Parillaud's performance. The only actor, whose performance is comparable to the original one, is Harvey Keitel. The screenplay is the same so I have no comment to add. In conclusion I give Point of no Return 6 out of 10 or * out of ***** stars. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good example for the problem of remakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, let's start off with the hard truth: It's not as good as the original. However, it would be a average to good film in its own right, but as it is, there are several shortcomings. Many of them are details, but nonetheless important - it makes a difference, if "Nina" is stupid enough not to load the automatic properly or if in "Nikita" it is a revolver with the first chamber purposefully empty. Also, the atmosphere in the original is much darker, the obscure government agency is essentially the bad guys as well, a tradition well founded in other french films like "Le professionel" (NOT Leon, the Belmondo-one). The american tries to superimpose these (take the guy selling nuclear information to the arabs), which doesn't help the plot in any way and is essentially superfluous. With regards to the actors: The two main characters Bridget Fonda and Gabriel Byrne do a good job, but the relationship remains a bit too distant. The rest of the cast doesn't do as well, Harvey Keitel (thou one of my favorite actors) is way too stereotypic (and does much better in the same role in Pulp Fiction), and the boyfriend simply is bland - in the french original, he is a way more mysterious figure, and the end also differs significantly - here she gets free because her "leader" chooses so, there he is forced by the mystery man, her boyfriend ... All in all, the american remake is shallowed down to suit the american audience (sorry to tell you :)) and sticks too close to the original - if it hadn't, one might have overlooked some shortcomings, but then again, the problem is that the scripts aren't too different so the changes for worse really stick out. Try the original if you don't believe me...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bridget Fonda plays a corn-fed, apple pie-cheeked version of Luc Besson's fractured punkette hit woman, Nikita. Is the remake as good as the original? Mais non! Hollywood's fascination with French originals mostly results in poor copies like this Luke-warm version of Besson's energetic, sexy Nikita.Here, it's Bridget Fonda playing the streetwise druggie who kills a policeman during a robbery and is promptly state-executed. Or not - since she finds herself alive and returned to school, a place of learning for government assassins. The alternative is real execution, so she trains as a killer, gets a glamorous makeover by Amanda (Bancroft) and a minder (Byrne) who - naturally - falls for her. Her big problem is that she is only useful if she goes on killing; life's not easy for Maggie, turned Claudia.All very well, but with the exception of Harvey Keitel, who revels in Jean Reno's role of the Cleaner, the cast are pale shadows of the originals, and the action and far-fetched eroticism of the first movie are only tamely reproduced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can't truly appreciate how good La Femme Nikita was until you have seen Point of no Return. Bridget Fonda stars as Maggie, the drug addict who is sentenced to death after killing a cop but is given a second chance if she will train to be a secret agent. The film is pretty much remade scene for scene from Nikita with a few small changes here and there except this time all of the original's artistic integrity is sacrificed for mindless action sequences and unneeded sex scenes. Fonda is good as a female action lad but fails to capture the inner struggle Nikita faced from having to live a double life. Also the burning sexual tension from the original is now reduced to nothing more than petty conflict between Maggie and her boyfriend. Bob from the original film was played with a stern sense of hope, you knew he was there for nothing more than to train these people but you could tell in his actions that he did care. Here Gabriel Byrne does not seem tough and uncaring making any feelings he could have had for Maggie seem rather meaningless. Even the line "I will never kiss you again"seems rather out of context, Not only that but most of the other more important scenes from Nikita mean next to nothing, for instance when Nikita pulled the gun out of the bath tub while crying, symbolizing the toil of having to secretly live as someone else. Harvey Keitel is a good actor but is given a thankless role here as Victor the cleaner, coming nowhere close to Jean Reno's dramatic intensity and dark sense of humour. Probably the most disappointing aspect of the film is that there are no cameos from original cast members or no homage paid to Luc Besson's artistic masterpiece, it is just a remake made to suit the modern masses. The ending of the film is basically the same except made a little more accessible but also losses the sense of tragedy, lessening the overall impact of the film in general. The only reason I could see people enjoying this film is if they have not seen La Femme Nikita or those who found the original hard to follow due to the subtitles. Other than that there was really no need for this film to be made or for people to watch it.</fullReview>

I have tried to watch "La Femme Nikita" in both dubbed and sub-titled versions and have been bored to tears. I love to watch Bridget Fonda in anything she is in, she is certainly a beautiful and talented actor. I enjoyed her performances in "Single White Female" and also " The Road to Wellville". While "Point of No Return" does not contain much suspense, the background music and under-scoring add a lot to the flow of the story-line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young woman, Maggie Hayward (Bridget Fonda), is sentenced to death after murdering a policeman during a botched robbery. While awaiting trial she is approached by a government agent, Bob (Gabriel Byrne), who wants her to join a top secret assassination team. She doesn't cooperate and is executed...or so it seems. She awakes to find herself an unwilling recruit for the government organisation. She still plays hard to get but eventually comes around. With her training done, now she has to put it into practice - killing people, all while, on the surface, living a perfectly normal life.A largely-faithful Hollywood remake of Luc Besson's 1990 French classic Nikita. Follows the original script very closely, with some adaptations to US culture and audiences. Doesn't have the same edgy, dark atmosphere that Nikita has and is thus more mainstream. Still, a good story, well made with some good action sequences.Solid work by Bridget Fonda in the lead role. Her transformation from anarchic, plain, tomboy junkie to cool, sophisticated, sexy killer is quite something to behold. Gabriel Byrne is great as Bob. Supporting cast includes Miguel Ferrer, Dermot Mulroney and Anne Bancroft. Ferrer and Mulroney are so-so - Ferrer a bit too over- the-top and Mulroney a bit too stoner (he seemed like he was in a Bill and Ted movie). Bancroft gives a solid performance though.Most interesting performance was from Harvey Keitel. Not really for the performance, but for the character - Victor the Cleaner. He would reprise the role a year or so later, to much greater effect - playing The Wolf in Pulp Fiction.</fullReview>

She is surprised getting an assassination assignment during a fancy dinner where she jumps down a laundry chute. She is given a new identity and an apartment near Venice Beach in L.A. She starts dating J.P. (Dermot Mulroney).This is a remake of Luc Besson's "la femme Nikita" (1990). It is essentially a repeat of the original. The sameness does take away much of the suspense. The tension is simply gone. Bridget Fonda is a functional actress. This may not be her style of movie. She has an easy going personality that doesn't always work with this complicated character. She struggles to get the dark damage of the role. It's a competent thriller and may be better for people who didn't see Besson's film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first half of "Point of No Return" is the promise of a hard-hitting action movie that never quite delivers. It's a great premise - street-roaming loser being plucked into assassin training by the U.S. government - they gloss over the honing of her skills in favor of dwelling on her resistance to the program. Then there's the screen time devoted to her adjusting to a normal life, which means this movie tends to drag in places. The upside to this are the Anne Bancroft scenes, but she's just in charge of etiquette. There's no real tension until the New Orleans sniper hit, and that's seventy minutes into the movie. In its defense, between that last job and the arrival of The Cleaner, the movie does pick up from there. It's just a mild slog to get to that point.Credit where it's due, Bridget Fonda is well-suited to the role. She's got the physicality and the acting skills to pull off Nina's anxiety. She's a credible assassin, too. I mean, if I saw her in a restaurant, I'd find somewhere else to eat. But to be honest, I was walking into this hoping for more violent payoff.5/10</fullReview>

I LOVE the look of this movie. This is the reason you shoot movie on film. And why it should also be shot in anamorphic. The transfer is crisp and clean and sharp as a tack. The black is true black. Digital black is AWFUL. The color and contrast is superb to anything the Alexa, Red, or Canon can accomplish. This is a fact. If you can't see it, you're blind.As for the content, it's not terrible re-do for America. The one thing that the original brought to it more succinctly is the clandestine international flair. This seemed a bit...odd. Sure there are covert operators here doing dirty deeds. But it's hard to believe Gabriel Byrne being one of them. Bridget Fonda does a decent job. She plays the tomboy well, however, the sleek sophisticate...not so much. At the time, she was perfect. By the trivia, it seems Halle Berry may've been too young, but a Jodie Foster would've made it much more intellectual.Was there a reason for the remake? Probably not. I recall having watched "Nikita" first, outraged they'd remake it. As I've gotten older, this version is fine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome second half and outstanding performances by leads</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Point of No Return about 10 years ago and loved it. When I returned to it, I thought I'd go back to the French original first.Having just watched La Femme Nikita and Point of No Return within two weeks, I wish I could take the first half of the French film and the second half of the US one. In PoNR, Nina's colleagues and the uber-boss at the training site, and the training area and music of PoNR are positively B-grade. It looked more like a mid-80s Golds Gym in the background. Fortunately restrained but powerful performances by Bridget Fonda, Ann Bancroft, and Gabriel Byrnes redeem it all, and as the movie moves into the second half it really rocks. I thought the cleaner section with Harvey Keitel was much more convincing than the absurd caper of the French original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than a mindless action flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Point of No Return" (aka "The Assassin") is a 1993 American remake of the 1990 French film "La Femme Nikita," which spun a TV series that ran from 1997-2001. There's also a Hong Kong version made in 1991 called "Black Cat." My only familiarity with this franchise is that I vaguely remember seeing one of the TV episodes with Peta Wilson many moons ago. As such, this review will be based solely on the merits of "Point of No Return" itself (which isn't necessarily a bad thing since fans of original films tend to be excessively critical of remakes).THE STORY: Maggie (Bridget Fonda) is a drug-addicted loser who gets the death penalty for being a cop-killer. There's a 'burial' but she mysteriously wakes up in a secret governmental institution and is offered the opportunity to live; the catch is that she must now perform the government's dirty work as an assassin. She spends numerous months learning the skills and social graces necessary. After training she takes the code name Nina and re-enters society living in Venice Beach, CA. There she discovers normalcy (compared to her past life) and love. The consequence of becoming whole and civilized is that Nina develops a conscience and comes to resent being a nasty tool of the government. Unfortunately her controller (Gabriel Byrne) informs her that there is no 'out' and dissenters automatically get a bullet in the brain."Point of No Return" is one of those films that I didn't expect much from and wasn't overly impressed with the first half hour, but when Nina passes her final 'test' and re-enters society the film caught my interest and wholly captivated until the end.The movie plays like a mish-mash of "The Mechanic" (1972), where Charles Bronson plays an assassin, and secret agent flicks like James Bond, but it lacks the goofiness and silly gadgets of many Bond films and the characters have more depth. For instance, I came to care about Nina and her plight; this is basically a story of redemption and we want Nina to reform and find happiness, but how can she when she's conscripted to kill people? Did I say 'conscripted'? Enslavement is more like it since Nina HAS to obey orders or die; and the secret agency can get away with it because to all intents and purposes Nina doesn't even exist.Late in the story Harvey Keitel has a small and entertaining role as 'The Cleaner'. He effectively portrays an emotionless, lifeless person who's completely hardened his heart in order to perform his ultra-violent work.An interesting point to consider: The Armed Forces labor to instill esprit de corps and comradeship amongst their members, e.g. 'We are strongest as a team and nobody gets left behind.' By contrast the three Nikita films and the TV series share a common weakness: How can a threatening organization expect quality performance and loyalty from its agents? Continuous internal threats would naturally weaken agents' morale. When crisis occurs threatened agents cannot run to the threatening organization. Even though agents are under the threat of death and, in a sense, have nowhere to run, the threatening nature of the agency itself creates disloyal dissenters who will eventually seek escape, unless of course they're total mindless automatons like 'The Cleaner.'Another interesting point: Maggie is sentenced to death for killing and is then given the job of killing by the government. What irony.A few criticisms: Some scenes are formulaic and therefore predictable, like the end of the Hotel scene and the hoodlum sequence in New Orleans, plus Dermot Mulroney isn't always convincing as Nina's boyfriend, also some of the action is too over-the-top (e.g. the restaurant scene); but I consider these minor flaws in light of the film's overall compelling force.The picture runs 109 minutes and was shot on location in Washington DC, Los Angeles, Culver City, Venice Beach and New Orleans.FINAL SAY: I was expecting another dumb action flick like "Speed" but instead got something that drew me in and really wowed me. "Point of No Return" is an engrossing action film with depth.GRADE: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any movie that portrays a bad girl becoming a "bad girl" is always considered just a so-so movie. Bridgette Fonda is what made this movie go from so-so to pretty good. Her role demonstrates how flexible she can be when it comes to portraying diverse characters. Dermot Mulroney is also great in his role.I think it could have been better if all the characters behaved more "real". Remember when Miguel Ferrer told the duck joke? he repeated to himself after he told it...that is what you call "real".I saw the original movie...and though it seemed to be "older" than it actually was and was good, the remake was pretty good as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a little gritty, good plot, good acting, appealing actors. I'm not sure I know why but my wife and I both think this is a great movie. The main character, Nina, starts at the the very bottom and works her way up in the viewer's esteem and finally becomes the hero. The action is good, pretty violent, not suitable for kids. Anne Bancroft is great, as is Harvey Keitel. They are perfect in their roles. Gabriel Byrne is good, as usual. The transformation of Nina is very, very well done. I guess maybe because a villain turns into a hero. It uses my favorite plot, the "Rags to Riches" or in this case the villain to hero plot. All in all, one of the better movies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Meet Claudia Anne Doran t/n Maggie Hayward code named Nina (Bridget Fonda). She lives an apparently unremarkable life as a computer designer in Venice California. Appearances are deceiving. She is really Maggie Hayward a convicted cop killer sentenced to death who has been recruited by an unstated US agency for "black ops." Her boyfriend JP (Dermot Mulroney) is clueless even when she pulls off an assassination almost in his presence. But nerves are wearing on Claudia. She wants out.Her handler Bob who re-molded the drug addict killer Maggie Heyward into the cover of a respectable Claudia Ann tells her:Bob: You stupid ignorant little girl. You think you can just pout and decide that you don't want to play anymore? I mean where do you think you are? Don't you understand anything that I've said? Maggie: I mean it.Bob: You don't know what you're talking about.Maggie: I'm through! I'm out! Bob: Listen, which word don't you understand? There is no out, there is no through, there is no out! A bungled job requires a cleaner to dispose of the bodies. The cleaner's instructions are to use Claudia to complete the mission and then terminate her with extreme prejudice IE wack her. Will Maggie/ Claudia complete the mission and escape the trap? There is decent acting throughout but the film pales in comparison to La Femme Nikita upon which it is based. It is a regrettable fact of the modern American theatre that it is encumbered by remakes of foreign films and with a corresponding loss of originality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Americanized remake of French film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, let's set the record straight, I've seen both movies several times (La Femme and Point). In a nutshell, if you like foreign (non-US) films see Nikita. If you like domestic films,,, see Point. I found each to be excellent movies and very well done. The fact is, with few exceptions, a Hollywood film made for the American public IS NOT going to have the same flavor as a French film. Get over it. To the point (pun intended). This was a very well done and well-made Americanized version of the original. Fonda's portrayal of the main character was transitioned a little too fast and therefore appeared to be under-acted. This was probably the result of editing. Her acting at each phase was actually well done however. Her portrayal of the growth of the character and learning to care about someone else was very impressive.Harvey made a great cleaner. People just need to get used to seeing major actors in short parts. I am a big fan of his and would have certainly enjoyed seeing him more, but still think that his portrayal of this character was great. He was very cold and direct. He was there to get the job done and nothing else. See this one if you get the chance, but expect an American type movie.</fullReview>

Unlike other user-commentators, I found that this American version of the film was done very well. I still find the original to be the best. I am also a great fan of the now very popular American television series (La Femme Nikita). However, Bridgette Fonda gives a great performance as Margaret, a woman put into a situation she has no intention of staying in for longer than she can avoid it. As well, Harvey Keitel as "The Cleaner" gave one of his best psychotic performances to date (no offense Harvey, but you are the best!).As others will see when they take the time, the two films cannot compete with one another. They are both, on their own, classics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Point of No Return" is a remake of the successful French film "La Femme Nikita," by Luc Besson ("The Fifth Element" and "Leon the Professional").I've seen parts of the original and thought it was really good. I've seen the remake on TV about a million times (I haven't actually sat through it each time) and after viewing it maybe two or three times altogether, I have to say I don't see the "point" (pun intended).There's no need to remake the original. Especially considering it was so successful overseas and a fairly recent release.The remake stars Bridget Fonda as a woman who is recruited to be an assassin. Gabriel Byrne is her recruiter. There's no arguing that they have a pretty good cast - Fonda and Byrne are both good actors - but the sole fact remains that a remake was unnecessary, and the strains of the screenplay show. It comes across as an un-daring, half-baked project that is simultaneously redundant and boring.Catch it on cable; don't spend your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Americanized version of Besson's "Nikita."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For anyone who has not seen "La Femme Nikita", this movie comes across as any other competent Hollywood blockbuster. But for those of us who have seen both, there must be the inevitable comparison. Both stories are very similarly told with pretty much the same scenes and same characters, but some characters with different names. However many details are changed to accommodate the location changes, and to more closely appeal to what Hollywood thinks the American audience wants to see. There is a bit more violence, and some scenes contain more action and more stunts. Not a great movie, but reasonably good entertainment. Some will like it more than 'Nikita', but for my tastes, "Nikita" is a more interesting character study.Bridget Fonda has the Nikita role, as Maggie. Gabriel Byrne is Bob, her mentor. Dermot Mulroney is J.P., a photographer who becomes her boyfriend. Anne Bancroft is Amanda, the older lady in the agency who helps teach Maggie proper behavior. When Bob gives them plane tickets they go to Mardi Gras in New Orleans, where she is called to do a job, right after she beats up two thugs trying to rob them.SPOILERS. In "Nikita", she has not killed anyone, gets wrongly convicted of murder, and as the movie progresses has a more difficult time accepting her role as a killer. In "Nikita" at the end she just disappears after the last job, and the movie ends with Bob and her boyfriend talking. In this movie, after the last job we see Maggie on the foggy street, and Bob sees her from his car, but smiles and decides to let her escape.EDIT: I just watched it again on DVD, March 2015. My impression this time around is pretty close to my first impression.</fullReview>

The chemistry between Byrne and Fonda is electric and the fact that there were no love scenes actually leaves you wanting more.Fonda is devastating as druggie who wants to be left alone, luminuous as Maggie the made-over assassin then as repentant hit-woman, she strikes a soul-full chord. There is a heart and a point when every human becomes a machine, but she turned around and made her choice her way or no-way, It's interesting to note that Gabriel Byrne let her go because he somehow loved her and knew that he had to set her free or she would eventually turn on him.Interesting support from Dermot Mulroney, Harvey Keitel, the late Anne Bancroft to name a few.Sound, Solid but Gritty Movie..!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Point of No Return is a good example of an American remake that tries to out do itself. In Nikita, the movie ends suddenly, not letting the audience see what happens to the story's heroine. In Point of No Return, the Hollywood ending is present. We see Fonda walking alone, in victory, into the sun set (even though you can't see the sun because it is raining). American cinema won't allow their audience to receive only half the picture. The American movie hits you in the face with a sledge hammer, making sure that you understand what is happening in a movie. You won't be left alone, wondering what happened at an end of a movie and who was who. While Nikita ends suddenly, it leaves its audience with an unanswered riddle, much like the character of Nikita, a person without an ending. An American audience couldn't accept that. They would need to see a complete ending with all questions answered. Point of No Return is that kind of movie.</fullReview>

Keitel's dead pan approach to the role adds to its gravity. Unfortunately, Keitel has only a relatively brief appearance well into the storyline. In itself, it is not enough to save the film.

I always have my doubts about remakes and with this one I also had one thing in mind : was it really needed?, I mean scenes like the one in the kitchen from the restaurant are absolutely identical and so without any use but still "Point of no return" (aka "The assassin") is a nice actionmovie. The story is a bit silly as we see how Maggie is condemned to death but gets a second change if she's willing to work for the government by killing people. Okay even James Bond sounds more realistic but still Badham and Fonda makes it all supportable though and especially watch Harvey Keitel as The Cleaner, a role he would repeat a decade later in Pulp Fiction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only watch if you want a lesson in how to ruin a remake. Fonda and Keitel must have both needed the money or owed someone a favor to get involved with this dog after seeing Besson's _Nikita_. This is a truly awful movie. Besson's _La Femme Nikita_ succeeded not so much because it had a good plot but because of Besson's trademark jolts from calm into raw violence, coupled with excellent work from an ensemble cast of relative unknowns. This fails because Badham and the producers apparently expect a box-office-name to bring the project home in the absence of Besson's sense of style and skill.Anne Parrilaud's Nikita in the Besson version is tough, hard, violent, self-reliant and brutally sexy. By contrast, Bridget Fonda's 'Josephine' is wimpy and an unconvincing choice to train as a self-reliant, high-stakes assassin. This film seems formulaic and dry next to Besson's, with a sappy soundtrack, mushy montage sequences, and weak characterization.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How can Hollywood pretend to remake films in this manner?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is definitely not the first, nor last time Hollywood has tried to play a remake of a French movie in such terms. Although, Bridget Fonda and Harvey Keitel performances are quite passable in this remake, it seems that once again, they try to substitute the original script with special effects(i.e. explosions, blasts, stunts, etc.). The movie is supposed to be some kind of modern drama and not a police-action-series, as it has already been shown. I am convinced that Hollywood should give an excuse not only to French movie makers but also to world wide cinema and spectators.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I own both the French La Femme Nikita and Point of No Return. The French version was indeed original but as they say, a lot get's lost in the translation. On the French videotape a lot of the subtitles are unreadable. Things like French Nikita's tantrums tend to bomb badly. Admittedly, I'm not much of a foreign film fan so the superior technical qualities of the US remake are important to me. If you like foreign films the French original will seem better. If you are more used to US film/production quality Point of No Return would seem better to you. As a side point I like the US spinoff, "The Professional" better than either "Nikita".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While not the equal of it's inspiration, the 1990 French movie "La Femme Nikita," this movie does have the ability to stand on it's own as an enjoyable and exciting (and even thoughtful) movie. Great performances by all; there's even some interesting little secondary roles that are handled with a wonderful weight and pure ability that is the kind of acting I love to see on screen. First, there is Lauren Bacall as a kind of etiquette trainer - if the Marine's had a Miss Manners division. Then there is an almost unrecognizable Harvey Keitel (with blond hair, no less) as a Cleaner who is a kind of weird predeccesser to Mr. Wolf (the Fixer) in 1994's "Pulp Fiction;" here, however, he's a hell of a lot less polite. Great action scenes in this movie (especially graduation.....heheheh). Worth seeing for anyone who loves great government conspiracy movies - or likes to see how exactly to assassinate someone in New Orleans and hide it from the boyfriend in the next room. Well worth renting, if only to see Fonda and Byrne kick the living you-know-what out of each other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood-ized Remake Worth it for Comparison</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>La Femme Nikita is still the better film, but Badham and company make an entertaining head-on remake with tight Americanized action sequences and great performances from Fonda (adding more dramatic overtones to the character), Byrne and Keitel in a creepier, more menacing interpretation of "The Cleaner". Oddly enough this film improved on certain things but botched others. The ideal Nikita would be the first half of Besson's far superior film and the latter (third act) half of this Hollywood-ized remake. Dramatically, they made the boyfriend smarter, the action tougher, the heroine more troubled, and the tension between Bob and Claudia more obvious, and made the resolution and final job more resonating and action packed.However, in La Femme, Besson's camera work, the simplicity and tension of Bob and Nikita's relationship and Anne Parillaud's stunning beauty and expert acting (she conveys perfectly the emotions and complexity of a character who is essentially a child forced to grow up and learn abhorrent skills to make a living and then deal with the clash of those two personalities as they wreck havoc on her life). Fonda does a credible job and makes a convincing action hero (credit Cheryl Wheeler for her awesome stunt double work) and fares a little better in the dramatic scenes if only for the fact that the American script allows the protagonist to explain herself for her demands or actions. Personally, I think they dumbed down the French script since it had subtle nuances and emotional impacts that weren't obviously stated. Badham needs to find a better directing style rather than medium-zoom to long shots and angled action POV's (cheeseball...deliver from the 70's!). Zimmer's score is evocative and the soundtrack opens Nina Simone's music up for the masses.Nikita's superior...this one could have been worse, but it's not all that great either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Point of No return (AKA: The Assassin) is directed by John Badham and written by Robert Getchell and Alexander Seros. It stars Bridget Fonda, Gabriel Byrne, Dermot Mulroney, Anne Bancroft and Harvey Keitel. Music is by Hans Zimmer and cinematography (Panavision/Technicolor) by Michael Ferris and Michael Watkins.When drug addict Maggie Hayward (Fonda) kills a policeman in cold blood, she is promptly sentenced to death by lethal injection. But maybe there is an out? A chance to work for the government? Why so serious?A remake of Luc Besson's Nikita, this was always going to suffer the usual remake taunts of why bother? Was it necessary etc? Point of No Return is a good honest action movie, it has style to burn, nifty photography and likable leading actors. The action is well staged and thrilling - and Hong Kongish in style, and bubbling away in the writing are themes of identity, absent parents and a delicately off-kilter oedipal angle. The Nina Simone soundtrack is terrific, while Zimmer works around Nina's songs with an aural assuredness that grabs the attention.It doesn't push any boundaries, and although it has been noted in some neo-noir circles, it is only a borderline entry in that style of film making. But if kinetic is a good word for you, and ultra violence gives you a shot in the arm, then Bridget and her guns are definitely worth a first date at least. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not much better than your typical straight-to-cable action flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* 1/2 out of ****I've never seen Luc Besson's La Femme Nikita, so I can't make any comparisons, but I can say I'm now less inclined to give it a look now that I've seen Point of No Return, the American remake starring Bridget Fonda. From what I've heard, no major changes were made, the same story is virtually intact, except with a bigger budget and a slicker, Hollywood look. Maggie Hayward (Bridget Fonda) is a drug addict who kills a cop during a big shootout in a drug store. For her crime, she's sentenced to death by lethal injection, a punishment she doesn't take kindly to. But instead of execution, she's brought to a government facility, and given a job offer by an agent named Bob (Gabriel Byrne). In exchange for her "second chance," she must work as a trained assassin. If she refuses, she gets a bullet in the head. Reluctantly agreeing, Maggie is put through a series of tests before she finds herself a full-fledged assassin, but going back out in the world, she finds this an occupation that emotionally conflicts her when she discovers love with a good-hearted photographer (Dermont Mulroney).Point of no Return is surprisingly sluggish for a film billed as a thriller. There's only one all-out action sequence (a gun battle set inside a restaurant), and it's a poorly choreographed and executed setpiece. Director John Badham obsesses with slow motion and tilted camera angles, more concerned about the action looking cool (which it doesn't) than actually making it exciting. Fonda gets to show off a few moves, but her combat training is laughably unconvincing. As a drama, the film is not on much steadier ground. While Fonda's performance is occasionally effective (the scene where she juxtaposes an assassination while her boyfriend proposes is actually almost heart-breaking, hilariously silly as the scene may sound), almost everyone else is flat and non-existent, particularly Mulroney as her lover. Byrne is somewhat interesting, but his motivations are left unexplored, making his affections for Maggie dissatisfying and somewhat pointless.Though I realize Fonda's Maggie is the center of attention, I found myself curious about the other recruits and their mentors. Did their situation reflect Maggie's? Or are they training as assassins on their own free will? Why is it seemingly no one else except for Maggie shows the slighest bit of regret over their assignments? Considering Maggie's past, I find it all the more surprising she's conflicted about killing criminals and terrorists when she didn't hesitate to kill a cop (okay, I realize Mulroney's character is meant to bring out the good in her, but I wasn't convinced of their relationship).There's a recent Korean film out on DVD, it's called Shiri, and it features a premise not too dissimilar from Point of No Return's. It's an action movie that this one aspired to be, an exciting thriller with blistering shootouts, likeable characters, and a predicament that's genuinely moving. Point of No Return lacks such qualities, and that's why it's a subpar example of the genre.</fullReview>

Having purchased "La Femme Nikita", I recommend that no one view this Americanized adaptation that is sub par at the most."La Femme Nikita" is an marvel of cinema with Jean Reno and Anne Parillaud, it is amazing.

		<shortDescription>The Dark Side</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bridget Fonda is a murderous, drug-addicted wreck who is saved from execution by Gabriel Byrne, an agent for one of those secret government organizations that assassinate people who are disliked. She's recruited as an assassin for the rest of her life or until she outlives her usefulness. She grows dissatisfied with her job.First of all, make up has done its best to turn Fonda into a violently psychopathic and beat-up dreg. And she STILL doesn't look bad. How could she, with that architecturally perfect bone structure? And when they're done training her -- teaching her to speak properly, how to kill with your flying feet, which wine to order with which meal, turning her into a blond -- she looks devastating. And the director has the good taste to have her running around in underpants half the time.Byrne with his crepuscular Irish voice and dark features is fine as her manager but he doesn't have to do very much. Once in a while he does his best to smile and one can hear the creaking of joints long unused. Alas, Fonda's love, Dermot Mulroney, is a thorough-going lightweight as an actor. And the script doesn't help him a bit. As his girl friend with a secret, Fonda is in their bathroom preparing to assassinate another stranger through the window, while, out in the bedroom, he's proposing they get engaged. Great tension in this scene. If we didn't know it already, the musical score pounds it into us.Here is poor Fonda assembling a complicated ugly rifle in the bathroom, her eyes filled with tears, while on the other side of the door, in a state of abject innocence, Mulroney begs for her reply. Get these lines. "Don't you think I deserve an answer?" And, "We need to talk about this." Now, I hate to point out the obvious, but no normal man would ever say anything resembling this. Women say things like that, but men do not say things like that.By the end -- by the time Harvey Keitel shows up to re-do his role as "the cleaner" from "Pulp Fiction" -- the director sensibly throws away all this role-conflict business and turns the movie into the action flick that it has yearned to be from the beginning.Once you accept the film for what it is, once you can bring yourself to ablate the presence of Dermot Mulroney and enjoy the sight of Keitel being scraped to death under the spinning tires of a racing car -- well, then, you've got it made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overly sentimental thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disappointing American remake of the French action classic LA FEMME NIKITA, this by-the-by action affair contains far too much talk and only two or three actually exciting scenes of action. These outbreaks of violence are refreshingly well photographed and well choreographed with it, but the majority of the film focuses on unwanted characterisation and even sentimentalising - pointless in a supposed thriller such as this.Amid the pointless bickering and stifling debate, we actually have some pretty good actors hiding here who lend more credence to their lines than they really should. In particular, Gabriel Byrne excels as Fonda's softly-spoken mentor with an eye on her wellbeing. Dermot Mulroney is also fine in a sympathetic role, while Harvey Keitel is superb as "the cleaner", a character who disposes of corpses by pouring acid on their faces! One of my favourite actors, Miguel Ferrer, pops up but is criminally underused in a corporate role that requires him to sit behind a desk and do nothing. On top of all this, there's even a cameo by Geoffrey Lewis. Sadly, the fine acting of these people is overshadowed by that of Bridget Fonda, who is truly pathetic as the guilt-stricken female assassin. Not only is Fonda far too thin and weedy to convince as a trained killer, her acting skills are limited and simply not enough to carry the film upon.Despite some nifty action scenes, full of shooting and explosions, this is disappointingly shallow stuff. Sure, it passes the time and is photographed well enough to at least LOOK good, but behind it all you simply have to wonder what the point was when the film had already been made once. A missed opportunity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As empty as a spent casing - 64%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a general rule of thumb, most action films can be improved if the lead character is female - the more vulnerable, the better. There are literally dozens of films a year where some beefcake gets to blow sets up and shoot hundreds of faceless extras but girls-with-guns films are a bit less common. When Luc Besson was invited to America to remake his smash hit "Nikita", he stepped out of the directors chair and handed the reins to John Badham but personally, I'd have liked to have seen Besson in control. As an adaptation, it sticks fairly closely to the original so if you've seen that then this probably won't float your boat. But if not, what "The Assassin" (or "Point Of No Return" for US readers) remains is a faintly plodding thriller with hints of tortured romance and explosive action bubbling beneath the surface.Street-kid Maggie (Bridge Fonda) is involved in a violent robbery that goes horribly wrong whilst high on drugs. Imprisoned and sentenced to death after she kills a policeman, Maggie wakes up after her apparent execution in the care of the enigmatic Bob (Gabriel Byrne) who offers her a second chance. Training to become a hit-man under Bob's tutelage, Maggie's feminine side is brought out by fellow recruit Amanda (Anne Bancroft) and soon, she's released into the world with a new identity and a codename to be called when her skills are required. But away from the bloodshed, she falls for photographer JP (Dermot Mulroney) and soon, she must be forced to choose which of her two new lives must end.However you know the film, "Point Of No Return" is a cold-fish of a thriller has plenty to recommend but remains a bit of a cold fish. It doesn't involve you very much as though it wants to keep you at a safe distance. A pity because Fonda delivers during a rare lead part for her - her turn from spunky street urchin to refined, urbane killer is believable although it does feel a bit rushed in terms of screen time. I felt that there was too much story for the film and what was there was a little slow, never more so than when Maggie is out in the real world. In order to spice things up a bit, we're treated to a few thoroughly good action sequences with improbably big guns which are typically Besson - everything explodes and all guns sound like .44 Magnums. Byrne and Mulroney are pretty substandard but Harvey Keitel delivers a brief but brilliant performance as Victor the Cleaner while it's good to see Bancroft still producing the goods.I have yet to see "Nikita" but it is on my To Do list, primarily because of this movie. It's a decent enough action thriller, making the most of its ludicrous premise (why did Bob pick Maggie, out of all the condemned prisoners?). But I couldn't help but wonder how different it would have been with Besson directing - probably would have breathed some life into the material instead of the impassive movie that was on my screen. It was trying too hard to be cool which, those of you who know, means that you are no longer cool if you have to try. Despite the action and Nina Simone soundtrack which is something I definitely approve of, "Point Of No Return" is an average film at best but with slight hints that it could have been better. It's not a blast-a-minute action movie, nor is it a gripping thriller. It's as middle-of-the-road as a zebra crossing and lacking the kinetic energy it deserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Many average factors with a few excellent ones make average work !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has only 2 excellent factors.Firstly, (Bridget Fonda)'s performance as Nina. Portraying fear, innocence, alienation, and violence was her glorious talent here. Actually, in some places, she was more serious than the movie itself. This undoubtedly is going to be in her top 5 works ever. True (Anne Bancroft) and (Dermot Mulroney) played their roles beautifully; (Bancroft) as old and a bit conscienceless version of Nina, and (Mulroney) as the carefree young man who becomes careworn after loving a grisly mystery. Though, I see that no one could compete with (Fonda), or reach the "excellent" rank she mounted.Secondly, (Hans Zimmer)'s music. It tells the story in indelible effectiveness, being hair-raising, sentimental and painful. I loved in specific the fiery track of the restaurant's chase, and the blue yet optimistic one of the very end.Sorrowfully, the ordinary factors include the rest of the movie ! The sets were poor; I quite hated (Anne Bancroft)'s class of a room. I discovered that (Fonda)'s black dress, that she wore in her first task, is stolen, not remade!, from the same sequence in Nikita (1990); the original French movie that this one is based on (now how uncreative !!). (John Badham)'s direction is so average. It has an executive character all along. As an action, it's deprived of anything special. And as emotional it's just good. (Badham)'s only merit, I think, was leading the performances soundly. Some points bugged me very. Concerning the restaurant's assassination; how in god's name carrying out a murder, by a governmental "secret" agent, without any disguise whatsoever, and in front of all the restaurant's customers, waiters and cooks ? Let alone any cameras as well ?! Then, the through-the-window assassination was done absurdly; that gun was so near to the extent of being seen by anyone, plus it was easy to know the source of the bullet ! And the matter of kidnapping the blond mistress, in front of all of her bodyguards, was more and more absurd. Why not gassing all of them since the start ? Add to that unwarranted points like seeing (Gabriel Byrne) kissing the heroine, or (Miguel Ferrer) throwing a joke. However, nothing was worse than the ending; I don't know a logical reason for it but a desperate intention of making a sequel ! (Point of No Return) couldn't be into the point unless in terms of performance and music. Hence, it ends up as average, despite (Fonda)'s cleverness while even blinking, and (Zimmer)'s music which can make the stone cry. Well, many average factors with a few excellent ones make average work. And the example is clear; this work !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"She is society's worst nightmare. A scruffy, antisocial misfit, she's been convicted of murder and sentenced to die. But a covert government agency may be able to transform her into a sleek, cool-as-ice-assassin. Her choice: learn to kill on command - or die as the courts have declared. Bridget Fonda stars as Maggie in this thriller directed by John Badham. Maggie is dressed to kill, trained to survive, and set loose in a deadly world - where unexpected romance can complicate things even more. This stylish hit co-stars Gabriel Byrne, Dermot Mulroney, Anne Bancroft, and Harvey Keitel," according to the film's DVD synopsis.The beginning is ludicrous - with sickly drug-addicted Ms. Fonda suddenly charged with the martial arts powers of Bruce Lee. And, since this is a re-make of the relatively recent, and very well-received, foreign-language "Nikita" (1990), it shouldn't be any good. But, Fonda overcomes both the choreographed violence and baggage that goes with the role; she is sometimes staggeringly seductive and scary. The relationships with her two "leading men" are more interesting than not; certainly, the three are tense dining companions. Ms. Bancroft advice is useful: smile and say, "I never did mind about the little things." And, Mr. Keitel cleans up well.****** Point of No Return (3/19/93) Jon Badham ~ Bridget Fonda, Gabriel Byrne, Dermot Mulroney, Anne Bancroft</fullReview>

Like a glass of Cavier, this is never hard on your stomach. It has that 80s look. The film is a little grainy, the colours look a little yesterday, and the music is all from the good old days. The style of talking is different too. They don't talk like that any more. The films are of crystal clear quality now, with positional audio and all. But this kinda dark kinda foggy mood is totally lost.If you preferred Nine and a Half Weeks over 8MM2, The Bounty over The New World, The Hunger over Van Helsing, then make sure you watch this movie.

The director, John Badham was obviously a studio hack with no discernible style while Luc Besson is nothing BUT style. Bridget Fonda is the sole reason for watching this film. She transcends everything, including major hair transformations. 1993 wasn't that long ago but this movie looks strangely quaint. It's always great to see Anne Bancroft do one of her brilliant, scary, regal, creepy, icy scary ladies but she ain't no Jeanne Moreau. And what's happened to Bridget? She hasn't worked in years. I hope she's not sitting at home alone waiting for the phone to ring. Please, Bridget, tell me that you just walked away when the offers got too stupid. If it's a bad face lift or an addiction or mental imbalance, I don't want to know. Tell me that you married well and are living out your dream in a canyon somewhere.</fullReview>

Bridget's acting is far superior to anyone else playing a "Nikita"-like role. Including Maggie Q(in the new series), Petra Wilson and the others. Point of No Return is still my favorite Bridget role. The role of "Michael", using the name Bob, is played with more heart and soul than those in others of the Franchise though I have a personal preference for the "Michael" in the new series over even this one.I have never seen this movie listed anywhere other than here as anything but Point of No Return and think of a completely different movie when I think of Assassin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director John Badham must have been getting desperate to even think of remaking what was supposed to be a 'stylish French thriller' from Luc Besson. That 1991 disappointment was tainted by its distinctly unlikeable characters and their seemingly pointless machinations.Badham and writers Robert Getchell and Alexandra Seros have encountered the very same problems with "The Assassin" that Besson had with "La Femme Nikita". Endearing the audience to Bridget Fonda's druggie/cop-killer proves very difficult, even given her reasonable performance. Viewers will be hard pressed to feel any compassion for this hardened criminal, and may care less what happens to her. Character motivation is also a stumbling point, and often leaves us wondering what drives the main players' behaviour.Fonda is certainly an attractive femme fatale, and combined with her acting talents she should go far, though "Single White Female" was probably a better role for her. Likewise Gabriel Bryne (who plays confidant Bob) who has had previous roles that allowed him much better opportunities to display his talent ("Miller's Crossing" being among them). Dermot Mulroney is merely part of the background, and Harvey Keitel has a cameo of sorts as Victor the Cleaner, a seemingly pointless part that provided "The Assassin" with one of its few variations from the original.Apart from the extra emphasis on action, Badham and Co. haven't bothered to change the plot much at all from that of "Nikita". What "The Assassin" (a.k.a. "Point of No Return") appears to really lack is some political depth or complications which by way of explanation may have benefited the movie. Perhaps this action/drama is supposed to be about getting a second chance at life, yet it fails to really say anything on this subject.Sunday, July 2, 1995 - T.V.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ug! This movie was so disappointing. I'm sorry I wasted my money on it at the rental store! The worst part is that it's almost exactly like "La Femme Nakita" which was great! Fonda was not believable. I didn't end up caring about any of the characters, I couldn't tell what they were really feeling or thinking. I just wanted the movie to end. Watch La Femme Nakita instead because this move is pointless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This miserable piece of awful trash really wasn't worth the money. The original is so good it would be impossible even by European standards to do a remake. But you don't have to expect much else from the US. Only Hollywood have the bad taste to devour and chew up a movie just because the audience is too lazy to read subtitles.Fonda tries real hard to act tough, but that is just lost in her teen-smile and her rosy cheeks, Keitel does a real bad job as Jean Reno's stand-in and the directing is just trying to make it look like Besson did it. Which doesn't work.This film is god-awful, completely pointless and wouldn't have scored very high points even if there was no original. It's just not believable anymore. 1 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...but this time, the joke is on Hollywood, as the Luc Besson film upon which this was based ["La Femme Nikita"] was *already* the most Americanized French film ever made until that point.The only reason for its existence is for those who refuse to read subtitles.A tremendous cast makes it watchable: Bridget Fonda is fine as the street~wise urchin roped into becoming a hit~woman after a robbery goes wrong; Gabriel Byrne is, as always, superior as her mentor/adversary; Anne Bancroft does well with her role of turning Fonda into a more genteel young lady... and late arrival Harvey Keitel is perfect as "The Cleaner," who is called in to help with what Fonda hopes will become her last hit.But again: the joke's on us ~ see the original.

		<shortDescription>Why? I do not recommend this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fonda does well, and as far as I can see, her acting is the only reason to watch this remake of La Femme Nikita. The original was amazing, and this remake pales in comparison. My primary objection is the work with the angles, there appears to be little or none. Where are the monochromatic scenes, the lighting, the filming in general? Aside from the fact that the remake is less of an update and more of a dumbed down version for the public that can or will not read subtitles. Without major changes in plot, setting, etc., why change it? Having seen the French version first, I'm quite biased, but for good reason. Watch the original for yourself, then decide. I feel you'll agree with this comment.</fullReview>

The great action is gone (lots of big explosions replaces the unique stylism of the original), the subtlety is lost, the backbone and ending are edulcorated if not lost completely. What's left is a run-of-the-mill shoot-'em-up that, even if I HADN'T seen the wonderful original which it was trying (for reasons of money, obviously, and not art) recreate, I would frigging hate.

		<shortDescription>Too Bad For Bridget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A terrible Americanized re-make of a decent Luc Besson film ("La Femme Nikita"). Luc's film is better since it doesn't rely on the graphic violence for the plot to be made and the storyline is more believable with the actions scenes being more plausible. The fact that any originality in "The Point Of No Return" is lacking made this film even more the worse. Now don't get me wrong here, Bridget is a decent actress, but never in all the years has she really stole my thoughts as to being top notch. To be honest, she just has that adorable girl look that does OK as an actress (she had a big legacy to follow anyway, considering her aunt and father).But the script in this disaster did her an injustice in any event, since it was downright awful. No director and especially an actor, could have worked doing ad-lib with this script (Badham isn't really that good of a director in the first place). The stunt scenes were so implausible as to be laughable, they should leave those kinds of scenes for the James Bond type movies since they fit in well with that genre.I need not say anymore, as I am not trying to be negative as much as realistic; I simply couldn't think of even one positive at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not bad but the French version (La Femme Nikita) is so much more intense, dark, better acted and really what this movie should be. The screenplays are almost identical so you don't need to watch both. The American version has no feeling to it, it might be all that cheesy rock guitar music in the background that you heard in allot of '80s flix. Bridget Fonda is fine but she is too cute to really be believable as this character. Everyone else in this just fills space including Harvey Keitel who plays The Cleaner, more like the robot. This is made like an '80s TV cop show, so if that's what you're looking for you hit the spot. If you want an intense well acted movie, watch La Femme Nikita, it's worth the subtitles, go watch that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood should just stop making remakes of good foreign films because it simply sucks at it. Who in their right mind thinks that Anne Parillaud can be replaced by Bridget Fonda. The range of emotions that Anne Parillaud was able to express in the original French "Nikita" is something that Ms. Fonda does not have the ability to do. Ms. Parillaud showed that being an assassin is not all that glamorous. There is a real human being behind the trigger.The American version takes place in Los Angeles. If anything, a more appropriate city should have been chosen. LA is obviously associated with the glitzy film industry so it did not have the dark edgy feel that the movie requires. Vancouver, Seattle, or even New York would have been better.In summation, see the original French version and be content that you saw good quality cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Attempting to make the perfect Hollywood magic on placing actresses in action based roles, POINT OF NO RETURN does nothing else but fire blanks. Such an idea doesn't make it too well on the screen, as leading women aren't strong and agile enough than you'd least expect them to be. The potential is there, but it's still left unexploited to the brim. Check out SKYSCRAPER and you'll get the reasons why. For the film itself, the screenplay and writing suffers right along with the utterly scarce action elements. It tries too hard at duplicating LA FEMME NIKITA (possibly my final choice), resulting in a dreadfully slow pace and a boring 109 minutes. Bridget Fonda would've been so much more at acting like an assassin, and instead, we have the sensation of subtleness during the "stylish" scenes of gunning down victims. Her disguise as a beautiful model in red doesn't save the film in time. All I can say is this: disappointing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(spoilers from the beginning of the movie only)Being a fan of Nikita (the original movie), a fan of Besson's work and open-minded to whatever remake Hollywood want to make from a good story, I had some expectation for this movie; a great writer, a good director, some very good actors, what could go wrong? Well? everything!Don't hear me wrong. I have nothing against Hollywood remakes of foreign movies. I liked a lot True Lies for example, which have not much in common with the original French movie except roughly the underlying story. But it was fun and entertaining.First I was surprised to watch the beginning of the movie almost identical frame by frame to the French movie. Okay, why not. As I said I'm open-minded. The first scene, where Bridget Fonda Character Nina is supposed to kill a cop in cold blood? well? we don't see it. It is suggested only because she is later condemned to death for murder. Why? Is it too harsh to see a female kill a cop!? It makes no sense to cut that? that's the whole point! Second noticeable scene? again almost identical frame by frame to the original? after being beaten by a cop, Nina ask for a pen to fill her confession? and she is supposed to strike the pen through the cop's hand as a revenge. Well, she asks for a pen all right? smiling? and that's it. Nothing more! Too violent? Come on? Third major scene? She tries to escape, and when cornered his captor his supposed to put a bullet in her leg to calm her down. Well, she took the bullet all right as we discover a bandage later? but we don't see the scene happened in the remake! Again, is it to difficult for the audience to see someone take a bullet in the leg!!?? Last scene before I collapsed? when her karate instructor asks her to keep her guard high and try to hit him, she immediately slap him in the face in the original movie. That's the character. Not playing with the rules, unpredictable, and hitting the guy by pure surprise. But instead, I painfully watched Nina doing some silly karate movements, then when the instructor became suddenly and conveniently distracted she hit him. It makes no sense at all that way!!!!What a joke! It is not that this movie was badly played? it is just that after a while I was thinking that I was watching a censored version of the movie I liked. Because it was a copy almost frame by frame, but all the punch that made the scenes and the story interesting where missing. Censored by people that had really no idea of what they where doing to a very original and very well written story! That was too much for me, a complete waste of time. I stopped watching the movie after this karate scene, completely disgusted. Now those are small spoilers as you still have a whole lot of stupid movie to digest if you really feel up to it. But if you want my advice, clearly, watch the original!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Assassin is a very poor remake of La Femme Nikita</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can understand the need for Re-makes of movies but the general aim is to try to improve on the original this remake is so bad it ruins the entire story. The Assassin is a low budget remake intended only to reap money from people unfortunate enough not to know about the original or too Arrogant to watch a foreign film or those who may mistakenly believe The US version is always better. Am so glad i saw this on free TV i was amazed to see such a bad remake given the usual high budget of US movies ( ie US version of The Ring is better than the original).The acting is worse, script is bad and unbelievable (original was believable and near flawless, And shot on location in Europe) One example is shooting multiple rounds from a bolt action rifle without reloading ! - In La Feme Nakita she uses a Steyr Automatic rifle. Action is badly done - the original has fantastic action and effects and is well researched and likable characters. While the Assassin's hi profile b-grade actors just seem to drag it down even further. Watch the Original La Femme Nikita it rocks. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100263/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I hear about this movie is that you should see it for Bridget Fonda's performance.In retrospect, I believe that's the reason you shouldn't see it.The most Fonda makes of this role is standing around in her underwear looking vulnerable. Given that this is meant to be a (in my aunt's words) girl-power movie the last thing any of us want to see is a convicted murderer getting upset about killing a ruthless enemy of her country.The only passably good actors in this movie are Gabriel Byrne, Harvey Keitel and Anne Bancroft, and they are all obscenely wasted in one-dimensional roles. I hope they were well paid because talents such as theirs deserve better material.The direction of this turgid excuse for a film is almost as bad as Bridget Fonda's performance. Think John Woo in recent years (Face/Off and Mission: Impossible II) combined with Tony Scott (best known for the woeful Top Gun) and you have a director who doesn't know whether to focus on the gun battles or wallow in melodramatic romance.The music is late 80's synthesizer of the worst kind. It's so unspeakably bad I can't even describe it.The three stars are for Keitel, Byrne, and Bancroft, who cannot save this scuttled wreck of a movie. If you really want to see a good movie about a reluctant assassin watch John Woo's Hong Kong action classic The Killer.I won't bother summarising the movie - just check the plot summary if you want an idea of what happens.</fullReview>

I've never seen the original but from what I've read it a great movie, this one is just dull, boring, tedious,you sit there rolling your eyes through out the entire movie. you cant believe that you wasted your money on this rental and you wish you could get your money back. its one of the few movies that I've seen where the trailers make it look really great and when you see it, its nothing but a yarn, i mean yarn. not every movie should be remade and this is one of them. they tried shock value with some things and that just disgusted me. next time ill just make sure that i see the original movie and not waste my time on the remark.</fullReview>

The acting is bad on all counts, except for Harvey Keitel who was decent as the Cleaner. Bridget Fonda's character was very irritating and I have no idea why men would be falling over themselves for her, she was just self-centered and not believable. Her size and physical shape were definitely not reminiscent of a tough, fighting assassin. Gabriel Byrne, who used to be a recruit himself, came across as passive and way too old for Fonda. Particularly bad was Dermot Mulroney, who reminded me of a whiny woman or a pushy stalker. His character was annoying, ugly, and hard to watch. Harder to watch was any scene in this movie involving food. The ravioli scene was one of the grossest I've ever seen! Yuck! This movie could have been a lot better, 3/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Point Of No Return" (1993) starring Bridget Fonda is a USA copy-cat version of a famous French language classic, "La Femme Nikita" (1990) starring Anne Parilaud."Point Of No Return" (1993) is a movie expensively done, but a failure due to......lack of talent in writing, casting, and direction.Little, skinny, physically uncoordinated Bridget Fonda is no Anne Parilaud, could never make it as a clothes or photo model, has an infectious toothy smile and connections to a famous Hollywood actor family.....and that's not enough for a movie where the main character must be physically fit, coordinated, and a pleasure to watch at all times doing all things.Parilaud was all those in "La Femme Nikita" (1990), Fonda is none of those things in "Point Of No Return" (1993).Francis Coppola noticed that movie star Harvey Keitel didn't look good on the screen during rushes of "Apocolypse Now" (1979), and fired Keitel after one week's shooting and replaced him with Martin Sheen (who had heart attack at age 36 on the set of the movie, but lived anyway, and is still alive as of 2013)Nobody noticed, it appears, that Bridget Fonda was just not the right girl for the Anne Parilaud role in "Point Of No Return" (1993), and Bridget didn't get fired.....and the results are available now and forever for all to see and groan about.It is astonishing the rich USA movie makers could have blown the chance to make at least a passable re-make of the French movie.......all they had to do was look at the masterpiece (titled "La Femme Nikita" 1990 starring French fashion model/ actress Anne Parilaud.....absolutely brilliant actress in all ways).The copy-cat version was made in 1993 in the USA and titled "Point Of No Return" stars Peter Fonda's daughter (Henry Fonda's granddaughter! Jane Fonda's niece!) Bridget Fonda as the star.....female "secret agent" govt. "licensed to kill" type.The USA copy-cat movie is almost a shot-for-shot copy of the 1990 French movie until the final sequence, which is re-written to match the USA setting.It's all so baaaaaaaaaaad.....there is no way to say how bad it is.......However, for people who already saw "La Femme Nikita" (1990 France) on which "Point Of No Return" (1993) is based, there is educational value in having seen the otherwise totally valueless USA movie..... the whole USA disaster copy cat attempt is an example in spades of the fact that big, big Hollywood money can't and doesn't buy talent.........and no-talent types in high places get hold (at least sometimes) of big money movie projects, and blow it big time.Money can't buy happiness, and it ALSO can't buy good moving making results, even when the recipe for how to do it is provided step by step and the final ideal results are shown to the wanna-be chefs (i.e. movie producers, directors, writers, actors, etc. etc.).Money and talent are not the same thing, much as Hollywood establishment types often deny that. "Point Of No Return" (1993) is proof.Many books have been written about bad movies of fame made in Hollywood..."Heaven's Gate" is the poster movie for "classic bad movies" always at the top of the lists provided. The reasons movies were bad was....they didn't make (enough) money for the movie makers and investors. How tragic!But bad art ("Point Of No Return" 1993 is an example) is never cited......Well, it should be, and movies like "Point Of No Return" (1993) should be included in the "Hollywood Hall Of Shame" lists of all time bad movies.Comparing the two movies ("La Femme Nikita" 1990 French, starring Anne Parilaud and "Point Of No Return" 1993 USA, starring Bridget Fonda) is a valuable exercise in movie education."Nikita" is soooooooooooooo good, and "Point Of No Return" is sooooooooooooooo bad............Too painful to describe why, but screening both movies back to back is.....educational, to say the least!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst remake ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is possibly the worst remake ever made.Luc Besson's Nikita was a brilliant action flick with an outstanding script, first class acting and amazing direction. (as a side-note Nikitas first 10 minutes contain the best "cyberpunk" atmosphere this side of Blade Runner).In spite of the fact that this remake follows the original almost scene by scene, it still manages to do everything wrong. That almost merits some sort of award.First of all we never actually see that the heroine is guilty, the cop-killing isn't shown and the door is certainly open to assume she was falsely accused. And this of course misses the entire point of the whole script. In the original Nikita was a true bad-girl, addict, cop-killer at the society's absolute bottom. That is the frigging premise for the whole story! But I guess in Hollywood all heroes have to be snow white and pure, or at least allow that interpretation.But the rest is just as bad. The direction doesn't even play in the same league as Besson's original. The acting is flat and shallow without the humanity that propels Nikita. Besson's masterpiece becomes something pointless and ordinary. That's a crime.See the original movie, it is well worth it. Don't see this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Point To "Point Of No Return"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Opinion of this film is difficult to gauge without comparison to the original "Nikita", and may be influenced by which one is seen first. If I'd watched this first I may have been more impressed but, as things went, I saw Luc Besson's French version first and it blew me away. Thus, for me, the Bridget Fonda remake is nothing more than a sterile copy, lacking all the finesse of the 1990 classic.Yet I like to think my view of "Point Of No Return" is based objectively on its own cinematic merits and I agree with the general critical consensus: It's really not very good. The original, on the other hand, is outstanding. Camera-work, editing and soundtrack in particular.Given the dark nature of the tale being told, I was particularly struck by the subtle and paradoxical humour in La Femme Nikita; perhaps this was Luc Bessons way of acknowledging the implausibility of the plot. There was no such dark comedy in John Badham's version, making it simply depressing and one-dimensional.A fine actress Fonda may be, but Anne Parillaud's original and beguiling rendition of the elfin-like Nikita was of far greater depth. Her portrayal of petulance, vulnerability, stubbornness, terror, anger, determination and intelligence are mesmerising. For example, when the wretched anti-heroine is shot in the leg by the sadistic Bob, Fonda's grunts are feeble compared to the poignant shrieks of agony from the French actress.For sure, the central character of the reluctant female assassin is not one of virtue, and we should not sympathise. Yet she is alone, scared and just trying to survive. Parillaud lends a tangible humanity to this role which is not replicated sufficiently by the mechanical Fonda.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No more than a competent remake as it is heartless and with very average writing throughout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Maggie Hayward is found guilty of murder during a crime, she is sentenced to death by lethal injection. After she is killed she is naturally surprised to wake up in a room to be confronted by a man called Bob. Bob tells her that she is legally dead but that she has been given another chance ? to train and then live the rest of her life as an assassin, nameless and without roots. Despite initially resisting the idea, Maggie undergoes the training and is gradually shaped into a sleek, professional killer. However, as the training becomes more intense she comes to rely on Bob a lot more ? never an advisable thing in a world of betrayal and murder.It has been many years since I have seen this film or the remake but, last night, I decided to give this film a try. Sold with the better title of 'The Assassin' in the UK, the film cuts quickly to the chase and, within 5 minutes, we have one dead Maggie on our hands. Seconds later and we find ourselves in a training facility where Maggie goes from not knowing what a computer mouse is to being able to strip and assemble weapons in a flash. The second half of the film sees Maggie out in the real world and doing dangerous missions. The two sections are pretty run of the mill (how many films have we seen a 'training then mission' structure to a film) but I surprised that the training section of the film was not more fun ? usually these bits are good fun even if the material is weak. Here the training is too abrupt, unconvincing and, most unfortunately, lacking in a real sense of fun. The mission stage is different but the middle section of the film drags a bit too much and it isn't until the denouncement that it becomes exciting and urgent, only to give way to a poor ending.The main weakness here is the writing: from big gaps in plot logic, average dialogue and no real characters to get into. The latter is the biggest problem because the majority of the film relies upon us being involved with Maggie and being convinced by her. The supposed complexities in the middle section were ranked null and void to be by a script that didn't care so much about what she was going through as it did about having the odd bang. It is hard to describe but the whole film just seemed very, well, second rate and everything from the script to the action sequences really could have done with a great deal of polish and extra effort to make them rise above the standard of 'average' but it never really does. It is a sign of the film being in trouble when even the remake's famous restaurant scene lacks tension and comes off just as a series of empty bangs.The cast try hard and mostly do actually do pretty well despite not having great material to work with. Fonda didn't totally convince me as a drug fiend nor as a sudden expert in assassination but, once I was over the sudden sea change I got into her and she did well with the emotions despite not having the material to do it with. Bryne is quite cool and he has a uneasy presence about him that makes him good in the role ? but his supposed affection for Maggie is nowhere to be seen in the script and he can't make it out of thin air. Mulroney is average ? just meant to be a snotty love interest but not given anything to show why they fell for one another. Bancroft and Ferrer are both OK and add a bit of class and Keitel makes a sinister cameo at the end and does presents a face to the brutal organisation that we're told Maggie works for. Like the material, none of them really do anything special but they all do enough to get by.And that's the trouble with the whole film ? it is nothing special and is merely competent but no more than that. I won't compare it to the original because I haven't seen it for ages but, on its own, it is average. It has no real heart to the story or the characters and the action scenes mostly lack tension and pace ? even the famous restaurant scene. Has just enough going for it to be worth seeing once but really it is just an average remake.</fullReview>
