		<shortDescription>Very Enjoyable Despite The Flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was a young boy of eight years old I saw this at my my local cinema . In those days it cost 15 pence ( A fair amount of money for an eight year old child ) to get in . I actually saw it two or three times which eat up my pocket money bit I certainly thought it was money well spent since in those days I enjoyed war films and monster films . Yesterday morning Channel 4 broadcast it at 6 am which seems a ridiculous time to broadcast anything never mind a fondly remembered fantasy adventure movie but I looked forward to seeing it again if only to see how well it stands up as entertainment today . Would my cherished memories be hurt ? Do I have nice memories about THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT simply down to nostalgia ? To be honest I think the answer is a resounding no . Right from the opening title sequence where Douglas Gamley's score sums up the downbeat feature of the story we the audience are treated to a fantasy adventure that is a little bit different . You could point out the first half of the movie is somewhat repetitive as the Germans and Brits get one over on one another but in amongst all this is some serious debate on wartime morality , allied civilian ships carrying weapons of war for example which shows no one has a monopoly on self righteousness when the battle lines are drawn and the theories of Nietzsche are also touched upon . What'd you mean this is a childish film ? No doubt the people who watched this at the cinema on its release where more interested in prehistoric monsters than 19th century philosophy and it's not till half way through that the U-boat reaches the ancient island of Caprona which is inhabited by rubber dinosaurs and troglodytes . Yeah okay the monsters especially the pterodactyls are not very convincing but I've seen worse . It's also interesting to that this part of the movie replaces Nietzsche with Darwinisnm and I don't know if it's deliberate but this concept fits in perfectly well with the sequel THE PEOPLE THAT TIME FORGOT . How many times have you seen a sequel that almost contradicts the original movie ? This makes THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT something of a stand out movie alongside the very pessimistic final act I fail to see how anyone can actively dislike this movie . I agree that the special effects are far from brilliant but look beyond the FX and you'll see a very intelligent piece of fantasy adventure . The very fact that it has a sense of wonder and a truly haunting ending sets it apart from many other movies of its ilk like WARLORDS OF ATLANTIS and AT THE EARTHS CORE and nostalgia or not I certainly enjoyed seeing it again</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sense of wonder is at home in Caprona</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie as a kid in the late 70s at the cinema and loved those dinosaurs. I have now watched the restored version (91 min. instead of 78 min.) on DVD and still love those dinosaurs. There are few movies that I still enjoy as much as I did a quarter of a century ago, so this obviously must have something `classic' about it, though it's hard to put the finger on it. Maybe it's just the na?ve charm that was lost when computer FX spoiled fun to a certain degree in Jurassic Park and later on. No actor is a candidate for the Academy Award here, the monsters look about as deadly as your daughter's puppets, but nonetheless ? more sense of wonder in the forgotten land of Caprona than anywhere else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fun dinosaur movie with a solid British cast headed by suitably lantern-jawed Doug McClure.Respected SF author Michael Moorcock adds a dash of intelligence to what might have been just another Sunday matinee pot-boiler, and the downbeat ending (slightly different to the book) is a change from the norm. The decision to turn the U-Boat captain from the stereotypical dastardly Hun in the original book to a philosophical man of science is also a good one.The submarine is suitably claustrophobic and the jungle suitably clammy, just a shame that some of the dinosaurs couldn't have looked a little more than just as if they'd been borrowed from episode of "Doctor Who". Fans of which should be suitably impressed by future 'Master' Anthony Ainley's nasty performance as the treacherous German first officer Dietz."Auf weidersehn, Mr Tyler!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The survivors of a doomed World War 1 ship manage to board and take over the German submarine which sunk them. After a lot of disputing, the sub becomes lost and before long the enigmatic island of Caprona is sighted. Due to desperately low supplies the two crews, who call an uneasy truce, are forced to land the sub and find themselves in a world where prehistoric animals still live.This is a well-made and highly entertaining film. Doug McClure makes a good hero and the other characters are also interesting and believable, the story is well-paced and the music is suitably atmospheric. The special effects are not always as good as they might be (the giant pterodactyl and the plesiosaur that gets shot at look decidedly fake). But the film is a classic and I certainly found it a lot more memorable and enjoyable than any of the recent dinosaur films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film when I was a child, it had always stuck out in my mind and I was lucky enough to see it again recently.Although the effects are not spectacular, they aren't terrible. In fact they are pretty good considering the era.The characters are well written and likable, the dialogue is not over-complicated with technical terms but remains clever and enjoyable to follow.A real empathy is established for the characters who find themselves in a seemingly fantastic but dangerous situation.All in all I find the film enjoyable for anyone to watch and recommend it highly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great vision, god awful F/X</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was actually a pretty good movie, capturing a sense of adventure and travel that's almost forgotten from modern story telling, what with all the political correctness and marketing hype we have today. Edgar Rice Burrough's story is modernized somewhat for World War One, but still has that nineteenth century feel when people really believed they could find forgotten lands just off the map. What almost kills it, however, is the sock puppet "dinosaurs" that were pretty poor even for 1975. (Someone should have placed a call in to Ray Harryhausen.) Despite the best efforts to create a vast world, the switches between real footage and fake backdrops or animated diroamas is jarring. This movie almost cries out for a George Lucas style redoing, since with modern CGI effects and the same story/character footage this could be a very presentable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun monster film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Land that Time Forgot starts during World War 1 on June 3rd 1916 when a German U-Boat sinks a British passenger ship, a small group of survivors from the ship headed up by Bowen Tyler (Doug McClure, who was apparently a replacement for Stuart Whitman) &amp; Captain Bradley (Keith Barron) storm the U-Boat when it surfaces &amp; manage to capture it. The radio is damaged beyond repair &amp; the compass has been sabotaged so they effectively travel blind, the British &amp; Germans strike an uneasy truce &amp; decide to work together. However they are running low on fresh water, food &amp; fuel so when they reach the mythical land of Caprona they must stop to try &amp; find supplies. Unfortunately for them it appears time has stood still on Caprona &amp; they are confronted by various man-eating dinosaurs &amp; primitive tribes of cavemen. Can they find a suitable fuel source for the boat? Will they survive attacks from the local wildlife &amp; indigenous population? Can the Germans behave themselves for once &amp; keep their word? Watch it to find out...This British American co-production was directed by Kevin Connor &amp; was the first of four 'lost world' type films made by Connor, the direct sequel to this The People that Time Forgot (1977) plus the two similar themed films At the Earth's Core (1976) &amp; Warlords of Atlantis (1978). I must admit I like them all with Warlords of Atlantis probably being my overall favourite. The script by James Cawthorn &amp; Michael Moorcrock is based on the novel of the same name by Edgar Rice Burroughs &amp; certainly moves along at a fair pace, it's never boring or dull, it's entertaining &amp; good fun if you like these type's of films. It starts out like a war film &amp; it takes a good 30 odd minutes before it gets to Caprona, having said that the scenes on the boat are pretty good, tense &amp; well done. It is a bit on the predictable side although the ending surprised me a bit as it's not a particularly happy one. The Land that Time Forgot is good, clean, fun monster filled entertainment, what more do you want?Director Connor does a good job &amp; the film has a nice feel to it, I don't think he knew how to shoot special effect scenes though. The monsters look pretty bad especially if they have to interact with an actor, just check the Pterodactyl out as it just glides through the air like a paper plane &amp; doesn't flap it's wings once! Having said that I thought they looked alright for the most part &amp; the filmmakers probably did the best they could on a low budget, at least they tried &amp; you can't blame them for that.Techncially the film is very good, some of the dodgy special effects excluded. The Spanish Canary Islands locations look nice, the cinematography is good, the production design is OK &amp; as a whole it's generally well made. The acting is alright, Susan Penhaligon is the obligatory female love interest &amp; she's cute enough I suppose.The Land that Time Forgot is a good solid monster film that I think makes for great undemanding entertainment &amp; that's what films are all about right? If you like the other similar films by Connor then you'll definitely like this but if you didn't then I'd stay away &amp; watch something else instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If only it was as good as the poster...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The poster for The Land That Time Forgot made it look like this was going to be the greatest film ever made when I was a kid - dinosaurs, U-boats, cavemen, erupting volcanoes and Doug McClure: how could it NOT be great? Well, this being the mid-70s, the crummy special effects in the form of Roger Dickens' prehistoric puppets that don't exactly give Jurassic Park a run for its money. But still, this low-budget adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs' terrific adventure novel does have some good ideas in its script as well as dinosaurs, U-boats, cavemen, erupting volcanoes and Doug McClure, so it's not a total wash, and compared to the incredibly poor sequel, The People That Time Forgot, which threw away all that was best about the premise, it's still fun, if somewhat muted. And it has a really great poster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a respectable B-budget adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie as a kid. Can't recall how many times I watched it on the late show in my early teens, but it was more than a few. I hadn't seen it since about 1982 and was pleased TCM ran it recently, so I recorded it and watched it last night.The scenes came back to me by rote though I definitely needed the refresher after all these years. Seeing it now at 40, it of course has become a little more quaint in the wake of the Jurassic Park series, but it still held my interest as it WAS a very good effort in 1975 with limited resources at bringing to the screen an intelligent Sci/fi adventure with old fashioned heroics reminiscent of King Kong etc.The script, though certainly not as good as it could have been, stays true to itself, and even though the SFX at times look primitive (they still kick the snot out of the FX in Logan's Run}, the story is poorly paced after the U-Boat reaches Caprona, and the Neanderthals and the obligatory volcanic eruption are more than forced, the film never becomes kitschy or laughable, or outright uninteresting like dozens of other films like this made on the cheap. My only wish is it would have been a bit longer and included more thoughtful dialogue about nature and evolution and survival to give the story and characters more depth. And Ray Harryhausen could have done much more with the dinosaurs in the technical department.As far as leading men go, Doug McClure is good in this and will always get my sympathy as that likable, two fisted action star who had the misfortune of looking too much like Lee Marvin and sounding too much like Glenn Ford to ever get the kind of roles he deserved in bigger pictures. He was good in these Kevin Connor adventure flicks in the 70's, and is eternally one of my favorite actors as a result.Lots of details about the U-Boat and what not are probably inaccurate, and the story itself is more than too similar to Verne's Mysterious Island with shades of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, but overall, while I wouldn't call it great or even good, it is definitely worth a look and still a nifty little piece of entertainment for the budget it had. Surprising a remake hasn't appeared in this age of CGI. Could be a dandy. Are you listening, Peter Jackson?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1916, during the World War II, a British passenger ship is torpedoed by the German U-boat commanded by Captain Von Schoenvorts (John McEnery) and sinks. The survivors Bowen Tyler (Doug McClure) and Lisa Clayton (Susan Penhaligon) join a few crew members that has also survived and Bowen convinces them to take over the submarine that has come to the surface. They sail together but they end lost in the middle of the ocean. After many incidents between Germans and British, the two groups team-up to survive and arrive in Caprona, a land that is not charted in the maps. Soon they realize that the land has dinosaurs, pterodactyls and Neanderthals. They capture a native, Ahm (Bobby Parr), and they learn that there is oil on the land. They see the chance to refine it and leave Caprona. Will they succeed in their intent? "The Land That Time Forgot" is an unforgettable adventure based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' novel with the same title. The plot is delightfully naive and is funny to see how we could buy a story of a land forgotten by time forty years ago. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "A Terra Que o Tempo Esqueceu" ("The Land That Time Forgot")</fullReview>

I was lucky enough to see this when it came out and it enthralled me. I still watch it on television when I can, with fond memories. It is not aging well. CFXs have left it looking quite poor in places. However, for a B-Movie it is very well done. The acting, storyline, direction and editing are all well controlled. I agree that a remake may be justified, as long as the inherent innocence of it all is not lost.It is good family fun which will keep boys glued for an afternoon.

		<shortDescription>Adventure yarn with some spectacular scenarios and pretty fierce monsters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fantastic and amusing adventures full of monsters in lost continent by Kevin Connor and based on a novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs . At the beginning of the film , during World War I , a German submarine sinks a Brit boat and takes the survivors on board. The submarine takes them to the unknown land of Antartica called Caprona . At the sub are reunited the U-boat German captain (John McEnery) piloting his ship along with Owen Tyler (Doug McClure) and Lisa (Susan Penhaligon) , among others . The group takes a wrong turn and descend over a barren land and meet some primitive men , Neardentals and prehistoric animals . They have to deal with numerous risks, dangers, endure torrential landslide, shakesands, volcano, cavemen warriors, dinosaurs and discover a lost tribe .This engaging adaptation is a special version of the Edgar Rice Burroughs adventure yarn . There are rip-roaring action, spirit of adventure, derring-do, thrills, and results to be quite entertaining. It's a brief fun with average special effects , passable set decoration , functional art direction and none use of computer generator. This fantasy picture packs thrills, action, weird monsters, lively pace and fantastic scenarios . The monsters are the real stars of this production and its chief attribute. The tale is silly and laughable but the effects and action are quite well. Among the most spectacular of its visuals there are a Pterodactilus roaring menacingly towards the camera, a little tableau comprising attack of a giant monsters and the colorful backgrounds of the lost land . Some monsters are clumsily made but movie is OK . Highlights of the adventure includes a roller-coaster trip towards unknown land in South America , and appearance of prehistoric reptile such as Pterodactilus, Stegosaurius, and Tiranosaurious . In addition the final scenes where appears breathtaking volcanic eruptions and thunderous explosions . Some illogical parts in the argument are more than compensated for the excitement provided by Roger Dicken's monsters, though sometimes are a little bit cheesy. Filmed in glimmer cinematography by Alan Hume on location in Santa Cruz De La Palma , Tenerife(Canary Islands) and Shepperton studios , Surrey England . Adequate and stirring musical score by Douglas Gamley. This one turns out to be an acceptable collaboration between producers Milton Subotsky , Max Rosemberg and director Kevin Connor who also made in similar style : ¨All the Earth's core(76)¨, ¨Warlord of Atlantis(1978)¨, mostly starred by Doug McClure and with Dicken as the monster-maker. It's followed by ¨People that time forgot¨ in which an expedition undergoing a trip in search for Tyler (Doug McClure) who has been missing in that region for many years . The film will appeal to kids who swallow whole and sit convulsed in their armchair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Puppets and Submarines and Doug McClure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edgar Rice Burroughs surely had an amazing imagination. He is best remembered for authoring Tarzan, Barsoom, and Pellucidar. The Land that Time Forgot is one of his lesser known works. Like most of his stories, this one has some really bizarre notions about science. This story features a lost land where evolution actually runs...uh...backwards. Our brave explorers are a small group of British seamen and a German U-boat crew, thrown together on the U-boat by highly improbable fortunes of war. Both factions vie for control of the U-boat (!), which causes the boat to become hopelessly lost, and the divided crew unintentionally discovers the lost world. How does this group handle entering a primeval world? They decide to temporarily set aside their WWI differences and work together to escape the lost land.There are plenty of interesting characters in this movie. Doug McClure does a great job as a brawling, likable hero. There is a cute and intelligent scientist type woman as his girlfriend. She manages to keep all (that's right, all) of her clothes on throughout the movie, which is both a remarkable and regrettable feat for this genre. The captain turns out to be a better scientist than a submariner, and the first mate acts like wartime allegiances are still important. The main dynamics between the characters are who is in charge, the Germans or Doug McClure? Both sides are looking to turn the tables at the earliest opportunity, and this provides a nice bit of ongoing tension in the movie.It is hard to comment on the 'science' of backward evolution in this lost land of Caprona. At least it provides a rationale for the abundant mix of dinosaurs and cave men. Now, about those dinosaurs. They are cheesy puppets! 'Cmon people. It's 1975. What about stop motion? If only. However, as poor as some of the dinosaurs look, they do make interesting appearances, sometimes including direct attacks on the crew. Everything else, the lost world of Caprona, the U-boat, the costumes are all very well done and look great.What really makes this movie work is that the pace and action of the story do not disappoint, and the plot never stagnates. The characters are compelling and have competing interests. The plot builds to several crises occurring at once, including a discovery that the crew theoretically might not be able to leave the evolutionary pull of Caprona, that the U-boat has the fuel needed to escape, then a volcano erupts, and an armed play for control of the boat occurs. The final scene is a wonderful blend of intensity and pathos as the U-boat heads to sea with flames and destruction all around. It is a spectacular finish, and it wraps the movie up perfectly.This is a well written, well acted 'Lost World' type movie. I love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on a 1918 novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs. After a German U-Boat sinks a British ship during WWI, a diverse group of survivors make the discovery of a lifetime. A traveled war veteran, a beautiful scientist and a German commander are the core of a group stranded on an uncharted island in the South Sea that has escaped the hands of time and is inhabited by prehistoric creatures and caveman-like civilization. One of the more interesting dinosaur movies. Very good visuals and special effects.A very watchable ensemble cast that includes: Doug McClure, Susan Penhaligon, John McEnery, Godfrey James, Bobby Parr and Anthony Ainley.

		<shortDescription>Weird, Surreal Potboiler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have fond memories of this movie from a VHS copy recorded off the TV, so I was very happy to see it out on MGM's Midnite Movies DVD series. Doug McClure is a reliable everyman, and I like him in this sort of stuff. It helps that he's backed up by dependable character actors who were actually cast to FIT THE PARTS, and yes, I think the acting in this film is good, right down to silly old Ahm... too bad about his pointless death scene, though. Really, the two best supporting characters are Dietz and the Captain... Schoernhortz or Schornverts or something suitably Teutonic. Indeed, after all the dinosaurs and cave men and FX trickery, the movie's two high points are: 1) Dietz on the U-boat shouting ashore "Goodbye Mister Tyler, Goodbye!" and "Auf wittersane(spell.?)" although in his accent it comes out "Gudbye Mistah Tylah, Gudbyeeeah!" and "A-veeterzane!".2) Schoernhortz, semi-conscious in his quarters, crying out "Leavfing? Ve are Leavfing!?" as the U-boat chugs towards freedom... but it was not to be.These two moments alone are worth price of admission, but there's plenty more where that came from.</fullReview>

God, he was so handsome in that leather German Sailor outfit. He looked so young, so cute without that beard of evil, but oh he is so evil. And during the fight scene with the fat guy his shirt almost comes off oh god yes why won't it come all the way off?

		<shortDescription>The Lost World Of Caprona</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of us today who think of Edgar Rice Burroughs exclusively with the Tarzan books and the cottage industry from the film community that those books spawned, Mr. Burroughs did write all kinds of other stories of adventure, even venturing into the world of science fiction. The Land That Time Forgot was taken from one of his stories about a very mixed group of people who discover a lost world. A world inside the hollow of the earth populated with species of animal and man from each stage of evolution.That theory was postulated by any number of folks, most eloquently during the first half of the 19th century by John Cleve Symmes whose cousin Anna Symmes married one of our presidents William Henry Harrison. Burroughs had quite a history to draw from in creating his lost world of Caprona and the strange collection of people who find it.Doug McClure is an American taking passage on a British vessel that was carrying arms making it a target for U-Boat commander John McEnery. The boat is sunk by the U-Boat, but the survivors manage to board the U-Boat and take it over. Those things in World War I were quite small and so were the crews. Through a complicated series of events this U-Boat finds itself near the South Pole and sailing into a frozen harbor, they come out the other end on a lush green world and are attacked by an ancient sea going Plesiosaurus. That's the beginning of the adventure with our intrepid mixed crew meeting all kinds of ancient natural wonders.There's one woman on board, Australian actress Susan Penhaligon and you would have thought with her the only female, a lot more of the stranded sailors would start having thoughts. Her thoughts are only however for Doug McClure.By comparison to today, the special effects aren't really up to snuff. Then again DeMille films which were the last word in special effects in their day are also considered old hat. The Land That Time Forgot is an old fashioned adventure story, the kind that would get revived very shortly by the Indiana Jones films. This film is not as good as any of the Indiana Jones stuff, but still a nice afternoon's viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie! It proves that it is not special effects that carry a movie, but a good believable story. That is proved because most of the effects used in the film are not good. However the acting is and so is the story! None of the characters appear "cartoonish" with maybe the exception of the pre historic man. But heck, we don't know what pre historic men were like so it doesn't hamper the story. Doug McClure is a very solid lead with the submarine captain in a superb supporting role. The other German officer makes a great villain. This is one of my favorites of all time! Even it's sequel, "The People Time Forgot" wasn't bad. **** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fun, entertaining dinosaur/caveman movie based on a novel by Edgar Rice Borroughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite old-time dinosaur movies based on a book that I kind of liked. Doug McClure leads the cast in this motion picture and he did his usual fine job. What a lot of people complain about this movie are the dinosaurs, which are some of the fakest you can find in a 70s dinosaur flick. And I have to admit, they are correct. Heck, the pterosaurs can't even flap their wings and only one of them (the one that snatches up Ahm) even moves its jaw. The Allosaurs are also pretty fake in some scenes, but more convincing in others. One of my favorite parts of the movie is where the men that came onboard the U-boat are firing at the two Allosaurs. And also, the brief, yet bloody battle between a Ceratosaur and a Triceratops is very fun to watch. Also, the scenes with the cavemen are convincing and entertaining as well as long as you don't mind seeing people either get shot or stabbed with axes and blades. What's more, the music score for this movie is entertaining and moves along greatly with what's happening on screen. When the second Allosaur has been fatally shot, it roars a strange elephant-like kind of howl of pain and falls back while a powerful score of music plays. Overall, The Land that Time Forgot is a pretty entertaining 70s movie that I watch quite frequently.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Adventure Story With Some Reflections On War Thrown In</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people seem to criticize this movie for what they call its "poor" special effects. I think if that becomes the basis on which you're going to judge the movie, you have to keep in mind that it was made 40 years ago, long before the computer generated stuff that dominates today's movies came about. Personally, I found the special effects to be fine - especially considering when it was made, and in any event I don't think the quality of a movie depends on the special effects. Much more important, to me, are the storyline and the performances. "The Land That Time Forgot" certainly gets a passing grade on those.The story begins with a German U-boat sinking a British civilian liner. A few of the passengers make it on to the u-boat and manage to take control of it for a while. To me, far more than the special effects, the idea that a rag-tag group of survivors from a sunken vessel could take control of a German u-boat was probably the most problematic part of the story. Having said that, though, there's an ongoing struggle to control the sub which was mildly interesting to watch. I wondered why the American who had taken command (Tyler, played by Doug McClure) needed seven days to figure out that the Germans had sabotaged the compass so that they were heading south rather than west. Somehow, that seemed to me to be something that probably should have been noticed earlier. In any event, out of fuel and other supplies, the u-boat suddenly encounters Caprona - what had been thought to be a mythical island in the South Atlantic, populated by dinosaurs and primitive humans, all of whom exist together. The struggle for survival in a hostile environment is on!This was fun. It['s not a masterpiece of movie making, but it's a fun adventure, and it even includes a little bit of ethical thinking about the morality of warfare - especially as Captain Von Shoenvorts (John McEnery) and Lisa (Susan Penhaligon) talk about why the Germans would have sunk a civilian vessel with women and children aboard. As the captain replied - the way the ship exploded made it clear that there were arms in the hold; arms that would have been used to kill German women and children. Not everything is as clear cut as we want it to be!The performances were fine. Nothing outstanding, but nothing that detracted from the movie either. It comes from a story written by Edgar Rice Burroughs, who's better known as the author who created Tarzan. Frankly, I enjoyed this more than any Tarzan movie I've ever seen. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long before Jurassic Park, there was ... Caprona!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Land That Time Forgot" is arguably the most underrated dinosaur action movie of the 1970s. Good B-movie fun for the kids (and adults) in the family that can't resist dinosaur fare.This Doug McClure vehicle about British sailors who capture a German U-Boat that sunk their ship, then get stranded on a prehistoric island (think King Kong's Skull Island), only to be picked off one-by-one by ravenous dinosaurs and cave men, has pretty high value special effects for a 1970s flick. It is an instant classic, like "Logan's Run," which also featured some of the top special effects the time could muster - until Star Wars changed the whole game. (Of course, I am excluding 1968's "2001" here, a Kubrick film so far ahead of its time that it stands in a special category of its own.)Caprona actually has a plot (unlike the Jurassic Park sequels, for instance), good actors in a fabulous ensemble cast, character development, and a great set-up (Germans and British who want to kill one another, instead have to band together to survive ravaging dinosaurs).The special effects of course are not up to modern CGI, but they are awesome in their palpable physicality: glider planes disguised as pterodactyls that pick up a real actor in their teeth by swooping down; ichthyosaurs that shoot out of the water next to the U-Boat to feed on human prey; prehistoric men that will bash your head in with an ax, but also make dearest friends and love the Edison phonograph music; tar pits bubbling and shooting natural gas flames. We must forgive a scene where two allosaurs (still standing upright and tails down as was the posing custom in 1970s paleontology) have strings attached. Puppetry still beats stop motion, but take the kids to "Dark Crystal" if you want to see it done really well.The band of men and women is eventually defeated by their own infighting. The simple moral is that Nature will get us if we don't work together and get over our differences. As the U- Boat goes down in flames, the viewer actually feels sorry for the doomed characters, and equally sorry for the lone couple that was left on shore to deal with the prehistoric mayhem.This film is good enough to deserve a remake, but also good enough that it doesn't really need one. One the other hand, many modern remakes were made from movies NOT good enough to need a remake, or even to have been made in the first place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During WWI, a German U-boat sinks a British passenger vessel. Among the survivors are American character Bowen Tyler (Doug McClure) and young lass Lisa Clayton (lovely Susan Penhaligon). They meet up with some others, and together they manage to get on board the U-boat and overtake the Germans. After the balance of power shifts a few times, and after some twists in the plot, the ship loses its way and comes upon an isolated island. It's believed that this island must be Caprona, discovered a previous century but never explored. Time seems to have stopped here, and yet it overlaps, as the place is populated by both dinosaurs and primitive man.Apparently this is not that faithful an adaptation of the Edgar Rice Burroughs story, but taken on its own terms it's an enjoyable bit of fantasy-adventure entertainment. The filmmakers are led by director Kevin Connor, who went on to do other entries in this genre: "At the Earth's Core", "The People That Time Forgot", and "Warlords of Atlantis". They create a decent look for the movie (production design by Maurice Carter, cinematography by Alan Hume), but there may be some modern viewers who bemoan the pacing: the movie is more than a third finished before the characters even get to the island. Douglas Gamley supplies an effective music score.Certainly it's well performed by some of the cast, especially John McEnery as the German captain Von Schoenvorts. He's established as an enemy right away, yet is not a man without honour. He realizes that to survive Caprona, he and the British &amp; American people must work together to survive. Counteracting him is the much more ignorant and troublesome Dietz (Anthony Ainley). Penhaligon is appealing as the leading lady, and McClure is a serviceable hero. Declan Mulholland, who plays Olson, is noteworthy as the human stand-in for the Jabba the Hutt effect in "Star Wars".The finale is pretty damn intense. The movie may not be very philosophical, but it IS action- oriented once it gets going. Yes, the special effects may pale next to what was done in "Jurassic Park", but they're not THAT bad for the time that this was made. The somewhat downbeat ending may surprise and/or intrigue viewers.Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a bad movie, it is entertaining and decently done. Doug McClure plays the lead in this one and does an adequate job. He and his group end up cast away on an island. 'At first they believe it is a normal land. Guess what? It is a blast from the really far past. They encounter all kinds of prehistoric animals and even what I guess are suppose to be cavemen. The overall plot definitely has a Jules Verne bent, although it comes from the great Edgar Rice Burroughs. The special effects are not quite up to the era they were done in but they are not that bad. I don't know if pterodactyls could really swoop down on their prey, I guess no one really does, but hey it worked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ram that Tom Forgot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Land that Time Forgot is a likeably goofy and well-directed B movie with a few oddities to keep you watching despite uneven production. I recorded its 92 minutes off the MGM cable channel in 2012, nearly 4 decades after seeing it in the mid-1970s in Piedmont North Carolina at the Graham Theater, which stayed open long after most downtown theaters had fallen to mall-plexes but remained limited to movies of this middling character. I talked some family and friends into going with me. Seeing the title on the way in my little sister announced she thought we had been going to see "The Ram that Tom Forgot." A different title wouldn't make much difference for this film's reception, but no one gave me a hard time even though I probably liked it more than anyone. Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote excellent action sequences, and the initial capture of the submarine by a rowboat is well-imagined and well?executed. As other reviewers point out, the film's direction is fast-paced. The talky parts are helped by a good cast?7 or 8 years earlier John McEnery had played an electric Mercutio in Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet; Susan Penhaligon was both babely and convincing as a femme paleontologist; Doug McClure was born for two-fisted roles; and the remaining cast took acting seriously like good Brits do. The submarine scenes were all convincing enough, especially the exterior shots of the sub entering the Land that Time Forgot via an underground river. Every reviewer justifiably gripes about the puppet-dinosaurs and the board-stiff pterodactyls, but the very first dinosaur shown, the water-dwelling diplodocus hashing on aquatic vegetation, is the best special effect of the whole movie, perhaps because water provided cover for the dino-puppet's manipulations.The science fiction theme, however preposterous, worked for me. Odds are that half the folks reading this note think humans appeared by divine magic in the fairly recent past, but a great gift of being born in the past century or so is that humans can begin to understand evolution, which like God is a mystery to be learned one's whole life through. As I recall, Burroughs's variation on evolution was that, in the Land that Time Forgot, every organism makes a complete evolution from micro-organism to higher mammal, in contrast to normal evolution through a species' genetic variation across generations. When that likable native is captured early in the movie, for instance, he seems to be approximately Cro-Magnon, but by the end of the film he looks and talks (and fights) as homo sapiens?a cool counter-factual thought experiment leading us closer to knowing how things really work, enlivened by action sequences and fair-enough acting on the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... I went and saw this with the family at a theatre which has since been transformed into dental center run by local Koreans. I can't say I remembered too much of the film, until today when I purchased a DVD reissue of this piece of 1975 nostalgia.The marionette-dinos were some of the worst prehistoric SFX ever put on screen, but the film still holds together after a fashion. There's essentially no plot, but a loosely tied together story of survival and cooperation between two at-odds factions.Burrough's source material is lifted out of Victorian England and pushed forward into the time of "The Great War". Whether that's good or bad is up to the viewer. As a kid I really didn't understand the relevance of it, and, as an adult, ... well ... I still don't :-) If you're expecting Jurassic Park like hi-jinx, then look elsewhere. This is 70s B-grade dino-schlock, and an "Oscar" for SFX (much less anything else) is the last thing on the minds of the film makers. McClure's acting is what it is, there, but not much else. The best thesping is done by the U-Boat skipper who adds a bit of intellectual dash to this flick.If you remember seeing this thing in 1975 like I do, then grab a cheap copy and take a stroll down memory lane.Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boatloads (or submarine-loads) of fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've loved this film since I first saw it on late night TV, many years ago. It's a fine B-movie adventure, full of imagination and adventure. The effects are a bit cheesy, but that's what makes it a B-movie; well, that and the quality of acting.The film adapts the Edgar Rice Burroughs novel of the same name. This more than any other of Burroughs' novels owed a great debt to Conan Doyle's "The Lost World." Instead of Prof. Challenger, we have Bowen Tyler, survivor of a U-boat attack, who leads a daring take-over of their attacker's sub. After a bit of back and forth, the German crew and their American and British adversaries find themselves lost at sea. They eventually come across the legendary land of Caprona. Here, they discover a hidden world of dinosaurs, early hominoids, and unstable volcanoes.Doug McClure was credible as the hero. He's likable and capable enough to carry the heroic end, without being in the Indiana Jones mold. McClure was best known for The Virginian and was a decent B-movie actor. John McEnrey was great as the U-boat captain, Von Schoenvorts. Doctor Who fans will notice a pre-Master Anthony Ainley as one of the German crew.The effects were typical for an Amicus film, low budget, but serviceable. The dinosaurs can't compare to Jurassic Park, but they were the equal, if not better, than a Godzilla film. They are kept out of sight enough to be effective.What the film lacks in budget and acting talent, it makes up for with imagination and pacing. The dinosaurs are teased and the mystery of the land is allowed to build, with plenty of excitement along the way. the story is fairly faithful to Burroughs, so there are plenty of cliffhangers.This is definitely a fun family film, perfect for a rainy day or a monster marathon.</fullReview>

That time came after seeing the abomination that was the 2009 SyFy film, and apart from some of the film looking dated and there are poor special effects in places, I thoroughly enjoyed this. Seeing this film was more than just a nostalgic trip down memory lane, it had a memorable and exciting story, fun dialogue and characters, a wonderful score, good pacing and above decent direction and acting.Overall, while the Land that Time Forgot is imperfect it is worth watching and not one to dismiss. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Adventure You will Never Forget!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Land That Time Forgot is directed by Kevin Connor and adapted to screenplay by Michael Moorcock &amp; James Cawthorn from the Edgar Rice Burroughs novel of the same name. It stars Doug McClure, Keith Barron, John McEnery, Susan Penhaligon, Anthony Ainley and Declan Mulholland. Music is by Douglas Gamley and cinematography by Alan Hume. It is the first of four feature films featuring the pairing of director Kevin Connor and actor Doug McClure. Story is set during World War I and sees an uneasy alliance formed between enemies on board a German U-Boat after it drifts for miles and lands in a lost world of dinosaurs and cavemen.Rationale goes out the window, as does any hope of quality thesping, in the sort of cheese laden creature feature that thrilled many a child back in the mid to late 1970's. Film was enough of a success that it spawned three more films of the same ilk; At the Earth's Core (1976), The People That Time Forgot (1977) and Warlords of Atlantis (1978). Of the four, this is the one that arguably has the most about it in terms of plotting and character development. Certainly it's the biggest budgeted of the four. In fact for the first third of the picture it's distinctly un-child friendly, as story focuses on characters from opposite sides of the war clashing on board the U-Boat after the torpedoing of the ship housing the allies. But once the boat reaches arctic climes and wades thru to the sunnier "other side", it's all prehistoric puppets, fisticuffs and square jawed heroics from McClure. Ultimately a fun boys own adventure without sensible trappings. Not as outrageously fun as At the Earth's Core, but a decent launching pad for the 70's creature feature niche created by Connor and McClure. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weird ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a lot of ways, the plot of this film is extremely clichéd. (SPOILER!) A bunch of people discover some weird, isolated place where evolution hasn't gone the same way as it has everywhere else. We encounter all the usual tropical undergrowth, toothy dinosaurs and fierce tribes, not to mention an explosive volcano into the bargain.sometimes is. The mystery element becomes almost compelling at one point, although the revelation is confusingly disappointing; there are also some intriguing two-dimensional characters, particularly the German Captain.The ending really took me by surprise. I was expecting the conventional miraculous escape; I was astounded when the submarine sunk and everyone died. The last shots of the hero and heroine struggling over the mountains, with no hope of ever escaping the island, were actually kind of moving. Mm. Maybe I'm getting soft in my old age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It'll always be my favourite dinosaur movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yay! THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT (forget that sappy cartoon THE LAND BEFORE TIME with which it is often confused) is an ALL-TIME favourite of mine which I first saw on TV when I was a kid. After that, I always made a point of watching it whenever it was on, and now, some twenty years since I last watched it, I got hold of the DVD to find out whether it would live up to my memories of it ? or whether my enjoyment of this film was simply a matter of nostalgia! I'm delighted to report that this excellent fantasy flick from Britain's Amicus studios is every bit as good as I remember it: a surprisingly strong movie that can be enjoyed by adults as well as kids.Of course, this film and those that came after it were the JURASSIC PARKs of their day: fun-filled spectacles of humans fighting dinosaurs in a prehistoric landscape. Comparing the two, I think this film has the EDGE over Spielberg's effort any day: there's no sentimentality here getting in the way of the danger and death. Had Spielberg directed, good old Ahm would have escaped that evil pterodactyl and there would have been a couple of annoyingly cute kids along for the ride, so yes, I think this movie has the edge.Watching it brings back all kinds of great memories and I realise now how much influence it's had on my life. The creepy fog-enshrouded setting is atmospheric in the extreme and has given me a life-long love of fog, I still get a shiver whenever I see it. The early fight scene on top of the submarine is a masterful set-piece of two-fisted action and I'm sure this scene alone is responsible for the huge enjoyment I get from seeing guys slugging it out on screen. Then, of course, there are the dinosaurs. The first sight of that Pleisosaur through the periscope is still chilling and I've loved these mammoth-sized beasts ever since. Yes, the prop and model effects are poor in the extreme ? Harryhausen would have done a good job, but he would have taken too long and cost too much ? but as a kid you don't notice stuff like that. As an adult, I actually enjoy the craftsmanship that's gone into these creatures, much more appealing than a computer-created leviathan.What I loved most about this film was Michael Moorcock's script, taken from the original Edgar Rice Burroughs story. There's no pandering to the kiddie audience here, but instead a surprisingly intelligent story with engaging, fleshed-out characters. The first half of the film has no dinosaurs at all, instead showing the power struggle between the Allies and the Germans and very good it is too: taut and suspenseful, like a claustrophobic sea-bound thriller should be. When the gang arrive at the titular 'land', intricacies are forgotten in favour of all-out dinosaur action and adventure, but it's a fine, worthy pay off. The truly downbeat conclusion is still chilling to this day and the intercutting of the volcano footage is done superbly ? kudos to the editor for his fine abilities. Meanwhile, director Kevin Connor clearly has the right sensibilities and works hard to achieve his aims in this, his best film.Then there's the cast: hammy Doug McClure, excellent as the lantern-jawed hero who fights first and thinks later; this cemented his reputation as a B-movie hero and he's still one of the best. He went on to appear in many other fun flicks, although none are quite as good as this. Susan Penhaligon is the damsel in distress, and lovely with it, but Moorcock is careful to make sure we know she's an intelligent, capable scientist in her own right. John McEnergy is my favourite character in the film ? he could have been a sneering German villain, but instead he's an articulate, sensitive scholar caught up the horrors of a world war. Anthony Ainley, later to play The Master in DR WHO, does well with the 'sneering German villain' duties and it's worth noting that every actor in the supporting cast was established in his own right. Steve James, an American action star who appeared in the likes of THE EXTERMINATOR, is unrecognisable under cave-man makeup.Anyway, this is a lovely little film with great attention to detail. If you've never seen it before, you'll probably find it cheap and twee, but compare it to the other kinds of movies released during the 1970s and you'll realise what a gem it is. Long live Doug!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Our time together promises to be extremely interesting."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is based on the 1918 Edgar Rice Burroughs story and is set during the World War I era. I find it interesting that Burroughs' tales start out in one milieu before transitioning into science fiction fantasy; another example would be "John Carter From Mars" which opened with a narrator during the time period of the Civil War. In this tale, Burroughs opines on a lost world he calls Caprona, uncharted and forgotten for two hundred years and set somewhere within the hidden confines of the Antaractic.The adventure begins with the sinking of the twenty thousand ton British freighter Montrose by a German submarine. Survivors of the Montrose manage to find their way aboard the sub as it surfaces and in a highly unlikely maneuver, manage to subdue the German Captain and his crew. Further suspension of disbelief is required as the Brits, along with American Bowen Tyler (Doug McClure) trade control of the sub with the German Von Schoenvorts (John McEnery) once again before they decide they need to work together as their rations and water supply are at minimum, particularly after Tyler's maneuver of torpedoing a German supply ship that was to rendezvous with the submarine. I thought it pretty convenient that Tyler's father had a hand in designing submarines, which in turn gave him an advantage in knowing the sub's machinery and operating mechanisms. What were the odds? Things pick up once the seamen make it through an underwater tunnel that brings them to the tropical land of Caprona. Encountering a Neanderthal type being that becomes sort of a guide, the adventurers run across a variety of dinosaurs from earth's ancient past, including pterodactyls, a diplodocus, plesiosaurus and a couple of allosaurs that they summarily shoot to death. I always wondered in movies like this why the principals begin firing at creatures that aren't posing any particular danger. Perhaps in an attempt to elicit the viewer's sympathy in this regard, another encounter with a styracosaurus ends with the dying creature shedding a tear. The story line offers an interesting concept for one's consideration when biologist Lisa Clayton (Susan Penhaligon) proposes that the land they've encountered is home to animals and human-like beings that represent the various stages of evolution that Earth had gone through. Surmising that if they continue traveling in a northerly direction, they would eventually come across more advanced creatures, the explorers are waylaid in their quest by warring sub-humans and a seismically active environment that leads to a fiery finale. Volcanoes explode and fissures open in the ground that emit fire due to the presence of burning oil.The story doesn't have a typical happy ending for the principal characters, Tyler and Clayton. Left stranded on purpose by a vengeful German who opposes his Captain, the pair can only look on in astonishment as the submarine is hijacked, but their amazement is tempered when the sub is destroyed during the volcanic eruptions and attendant upheaval. The picture hints an Adam and Eve type of new beginning for them, now left to their own devices to make the best of an unplanned and unimagined future together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Doug McClure stars as Bowen Tyler, who is rescued from his sunken British ship(along with a woman named Susan) by the German submarine who sunk it during World War I. Taken as prisoners, Bowen leads a revolt, but is too late to prevent the U-boat from drifting into uncharted waters. There, they find a land called Caprona, where dinosaurs and prehistoric humans still exist. Both sides forget the war in order to repair and refuel(oil is in abundance)the ship, though they suffer some losses from dinosaur attacks. A volcano also threatens to erupt, so it is a race against time if they hope to escape.Entertaining film based on an Edgar Rice Burrough's story has good direction by Kevin Connor, and a good cast(including Anthony Ainley, before he became the new Master from "Doctor Who") The F/X aren't that bad either, and film holds up reasonably well, despite the pulp elements, and familiar story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After their ship is sunk by a German U-Boat, a few survivors manage to take possession of the WWI submarine when it surfaces in the dense fog. Unfortunately, due to various reasons the boat heads south until the passengers and crew reach a volcanic island in the antarctic. Once ashore they encounter prehistoric creatures and people in which they must contend with in order to survive. But in order to do that both the English and the Germans will have to put their differences behind them and work together. Having said all of that, this film was essentially tailor-made for a family night out at the local drive-in. It contains plenty of action and special effects and there are no risqué scenes or rough language to worry about. However, in all honesty the action was rather standard and the special effects were somewhat uneven. Along with that the acting was also a bit mediocre. Still, it was entertaining enough for the time spent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this film as a child and recently purchased its as part of a Doug McClure box set (with Warlords of Atlantis &amp; At the Earths Core)to see if it had the magic it once held for me. I found that surprisingly the first part of the film aboard the U boat was very strong (as a child your're waiting for dinosaurs) and Doug McClure was a very accomplished leading man. Doesn't over do it at all and is a likable guy you root for. I was praying McClure would not be hammy at all but he really owns this movie. Obviously the dinosaurs look bad compared to todays standards but the story, the direction and the actors are all in place to create a very entertaining film. What i find most memorable about the Land that Time Forgot is the downbeat ending which is most refreshing for a family film. I think its the ending that gives it the added punch when the credits roll. You can have all the CGI in the world but without a story, good actors and sure direction its pointless - The Land that Time Forgot does not have great effects but all the rest is there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that remakes (nearly) forgot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I used to watch this with my friends when it was on TV in the eighties. I'd seen a fair few war films and, back then, the prospect of Germans and Allied forces teaming up seemed pretty freaky and intriguing to me.The Land That Time Forgot follows the exploits of a German U-boat crew who get overpowered by a lifeboat full of civilians who they actually just sank (no, seriously they do? just go with it ? it's worth it). Anyway, the U-boat gets lost and ends up in a secret land of dinosaurs and cavemen. There, they must work together to escape.I'd forgotten how much of the film actually takes place before they arrive on the island. Maybe I only watched the second half with the dinosaurs? But it doesn't matter. It sets the scene perfectly ? displaying the tensions between the two crews.Then they get to the island and generally ravaged by dinosaurs. Only they're not really dinosaurs, they're large rubbery monsters. Hey, it was pre-CGI and Jurassic Park ? what do you expect? But, again, don't let that put you off. If you can get past the dodgy special effects and just immerse yourself in the story, you'll find that it's actually quite a tight and tense little number.What with all the films of the seventies being remade and Hollywood working its way through the latter end of the eighties and even into the nineties, I'm surprised this one never got the remake treatment. It's probably ripe for one, but, once again, that's not a detraction from the original. If you have a couple of hours to kill and can forgive a little bit of ham, just go with it. There's worse about, even with realistic dinosaurs!http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>average salad bowl movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie could have been better if they had overlooked (or shrunk to the very minimum) the submarine hijacking part hogging nearly the first half of the movie. If i were to pay to watch such a film, i wouldn't expect to watch a war or spy movie of any kind. The "submarine hijacking" part is not that bad, although it springs up from laughable premises, but it's not what we want to see: Mcclure for once looks relatively credible in that segment. The "prehistoric land" segment is good and the acting is fair...although we wonder how could the dirty lady dressed in rags instantly turn into a freshly dressed hiker inside a WWI German submarine. Nothing memorable and nothing worth mentioning. SFX are decent, but definitely sub par considering the year of release. Too much of a salad bowl movie to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was about 5 years old, my uncle bought me a video collection of a bunch of old dinosaur film trailers called "Fantastic Dinosaurs of the Movies". It was the goofiest thing and I don't talk about it much these days (too embarrassed), but I have a slightly altered brain and a lot of memories of an odd childhood spent making adventure movies with my plastic action figures about men with guns, fighting dinosaurs. And in short, that was what this movie reminded me of. When I looked at those dinosuars in the film, I felt like I was staring into the face of the plastic T-Rex toy that I spent so many rainy days with as a little kid. And all the British soldiers running around with their bolt-action riles reminded me of the little plastic men that I played with. It was just too weird. I connect too much with this film to give it a low rating. It was so darn entertaining for me. There is really nothing terrible about it. It's just very typical looking of the 70's dino movies. I'd give it 6/10 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting dinosaur adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the first of four sci-fi movies made in the 1970's directed by Kevin Conner and starring Doug McClure.A German submarine blows up a British ship and some of the survivors attempt to take it over. After blowing up more ships, they end up getting lost somewhere in the South Seas and discover an uncharted island, Caprona. They access it through a tunnel and when they arrive, they discover a land unchanged since prehistoric times. While on Caprona, they discover oil and refine it and battle prehistoric monsters including a pair of Allosaurus, a pair of Styracosaurus and Pterodactyls, Plesiosaurs and a Triceratops. They also have to contend with unfriendly cavemen which kill some of the crew. At least one is friendly though. The submarine gets destroyed in the volcanic eruption and earthquake at the end of this movie, leaving two survivors.As well as Doug McClure, this movie stars Keith Barren, John McEnery and the only female is Susan Penhaligon. All play good parts. The dinosaurs look OK, but it would have been better if they were done in stop-motion style. McClure returned in The People That Time Forgot in 1977.I enjoyed this movie and is worth watching if you get the chance.Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the first films I remember seeing -ever. It may well be the first movie that gave me the creeps. I really did not like how the natives used those crude but sharp weapons to off the invaders. Esp chilling is the scene where the German [or Nazi] crew members walk one by one into an ambush. True, the cheap production does it in and what does that mean? A remake. AH. A huge improvement that would be, PG. Otherwise, the film isn't that bad. I haven't forgotten this movie.

		<fullReview>In 1916, Germans destroy a ship off the English Channel, leaving two survivors adrift in a lifeboat. Then, dauntless Doug McClure (as Bowen Tyler) and pretty Susan Penhaligon (as Lisa Clayton) are rescued by British seamen. They go after a German submarine and take control. After additional fighting, the mixed crew is carried along the Atlantic Ocean, into uncharted waters. Finally, the lost group arrives at "The Land That Time Forgot" which they identify as the lost continent of "Caprona". There, they encounter not only prehistoric people, but also living, breathing dinosaurs! This Edgar Rice Burroughs adaptation is fondly remembered by youngsters from the 1970s. In the ensuing years, the special effects have aged poorly, and the once intriguing plot has evolved into absurdity.**** The Land That Time Forgot (8/13/75) Kevin Connor ~ Doug McClure, Susan Penhaligon, John McEnery, Keith Barron</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The special effects that time forgot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this when it was released and I remember thinking that the stop motion dinosaurs were breathtakingly realistic. (I was ten, in case you're wondering) Well, they were! They were state of the art! Yes, really! Anyway, if you've watched this recently, you will know how hilariously awful they are by todays standards. Frankly, Rex from Toy Story makes a more convincing dinosaur!The story itself is your standard "Ripping Yarn". All the ingredients are there. A U-boat full of Germans, a square jawed American hero, a simpering (but ultimately feisty) English girl, an aged egghead to theorise upon their predicament; all pretty corny, but none the worse for it. All in all, it's a good drop of nostalgia for a bloke of my age. Anyone younger will require a well developed sense of irony to enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Land That Time Forgot is a reasonable entertainment, featuring not exactly state of the art dinosaurs, rotten Germans in a U-boat, and Doug McClure's heroic firm chin leading the good guys to...victory? Not exactly, as the film ends on a surprisingly downbeat note...which led, of course, to the sequel, The People That Time Forgot. No classic, but my five year old loved it. I have a soft spot for it, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh dear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A crummy adventure with Doug McClure and company getting lost at sea and ending up on an island populated by pterodactyls on strings, rubber dinosaurs and poorly made-up cavemen. I know I shouldn't laugh at a movie hamstrung by its budget (heck, I'm a fan of 'Doctor Who') but the creature effects are hilarious.The rest of the movie is more boring than unintentionally funny, with appalling performances from everyone bar John McEnery and a plot that keeps the characters away from the island for longer than is reasonable. On the other hand, once they encounter the dinosaurs the characters reveal themselves to be thoroughly unlikeable so maybe it's for the best that they stay away for so long.Rather than expressing any kind of awe or respect at seeing these supposedly long-extinct marvels, our heroes kill and eat them, then shoot the cavemen and spend the rest of the movie pushing one of them around. In one scene two dinosaurs are standing about doing nothing so McEnery's submarine blows one of them up! I was on the side of the dinosaurs throughout this shoddy farrago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheap but Fun Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Land That Time Forgot (1975) *** (out of 4) Set during WWI, a German U-boat sinks a British ship and soon the survivors take over the boat. What remains of the two group end up in some sort of fantasy island where dinosaurs still rule. THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT comes from Amicus who of course were best known for their anthology horror films. During the 70s they turned to the work of Edgar Rice Burroughs and I think for the most part that these films were fun. With that said, if someone is expecting a big-budget, serious monster flick then they're certainly not going to find it here. It's obvious the studio gave the producers very little money and this is easily seen with the monsters. The dinosaur creations are all very cheap and it's clear that they're made out of rubber. At times the monsters don't "move" as they should and especially during some of the scenes where they're being shot yet they really don't show any movement. The most embarrassing effect are the Pterodactyls, which fly through the air without any movement at all. Their wings never move so one really wonders how they can move at all. Oh yeah, we see how they move because the wires holding them are constantly in view. I still really enjoy this film because as an adventure I think the story is good. I found the scenes in the underwater cave to have some nice atmosphere and I liked how the story tried to make the human take over the island or at least adapt to it to where they can live there. I'm certainly not going to ruin the ending but it's really not what you'd expect from this type of film. The bad cavemen make for a good set of villains and the entire German-British-American subplot that kicks off the film was entertaining too. The characters are also quite likable and we're given some good performances with Doug McClure standing out as the hero, John McEnery as the German captain and Susan Penhaligon as the only female. THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT isn't a masterpiece of the genre but as long as you don't take it too serious you should have fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What could have been a decent adventure film becomes a farce due to some of the worst special effects ever. Considering the cast and other attributes, why would any producer/director have considered ANYONE other than Harryhausen for a picture such as this in the 50s, 60s, or 70s? The allosaurus couldn't have been more ridiculous if they'd used Barney the Dinosaur! Lack of animation for the flying creatures added to the hilarity, and Doug McClure's battle with the sea serpent belonged on the WWF! Native inhabitants were not very convincing with contrived language that was in the same vain as One Million Years B.C., and Clan of the Cave Bear. Too bad they hadn't seen Caveman!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was recently on AMC's vibrant movie classics and I had to laugh. I had high hopes for this adventure that follows in the vein of "Voyage to the Earth's Core" and "Mysterious Island". I was sorely disappointed not only in the acting credentials but in the silly story line that reads from a five year old's comic book. Be sure to catch sight of the wires that are holding on to the Pterdactyl's wings when they grasp "Ogar" a half idiot pre-modern man who befriends the lost adventurers. The ending left it open for further rehashing of the same effects in "People that Time Forgot". Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't one of those reviews about poor special effects or technology, or being dated, issues that only the dorkiest people could relate with, but rather a review on the story telling, which most of us are truly interested in.The plot is about a combination of WWII Allied and German Navy members, and two civilians (the hero and heroine), who are thrust together on a German U boat and wind up in a savage land of dinosaurs.The manipulations aren't so bad by film standards, and we know from the plot that realism isn't going to be high. What films like this need are credible and likable characters, along with some semblance of reason in the actions.This film lacks both. For a full length film, only 6 characters are given any time, and 3 of them are barely looked into. McClure's hero is beyond "routine", and doesn't make much sense in any era.The female seems to be looking for an answer to a riddle about the land of dinosaurs they entered, but the riddle is not much of a riddle, and we could care less.A lot of failure in a film that should have been better, even for its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Par for the course but quite indistinguishable from loads of other films where McClure runs away from big monsters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a German U-Boat attacks a British fleet, only a handful of survivors remain but, without food or water, their chances are bleak. Luckily the U-Boat surfaces to recharge, assuming everyone dead, only to be stormed and seized by the survivors. Sailor Bowen Tyler knows his subs and takes over from Captain Von Schoenvorts to lead the sub towards a friendly port. However Schoenvorts will not go easily and sabotages the compasses, sending the submarine heading south into nothingness. With fuel and food running out, the submarine finds an island seeming just one big iceberg. They find an underground river and manage to navigate up it and emerge to find a prehistoric world, perfectly preserved and very dangerous.I'm pretty sure that Doug McClure has done more films with large bits of rubbery plastic than your average porn actress and the problem is that in my head they are starting to run together. So I can never remember which ones I have seen and which I haven't, usually meaning I skip them assuming they have. I realised I'd not reviewed this film so gave it ago while on holidays recently and have to say that it has done little to stand out from all the other films where large plastic things with teeth chase Doug McClure in a torn white shirt. This is not to say that it is terrible, because it isn't, only that it just does the stuff that these films usually do. The plot is quite good at the start but once on the island it is all explained for us in matter-of-fact terms that make little logical sense ("of course, every step up river is a step down the tree of evolution", what?) but by this point the monsters are in so it is alright. The rubbery creations are poor by today's standards but still have a certain retro-charm about them that I quite enjoyed, although I can only imagine what children raised on Jurassic Park etc make of them.The cast are roundly average. Like everyone else I can't help seeing McClure more like his Simpsons spoof than as the man he was himself. He runs around with his wide chest and big jaw and does reasonably well considering. McEnery is so-so but Penhaligon is just the statutorily required "girl in tight sweater" that seemed to be as much of a genre requirement as monsters. The rest are all fodder and bit players although it was amusing to note in the credits that one of them is called Colin Farrell.Overall a typical Doug McClure monster movie that does all that you know it will ? a lost land, loads of monsters and then the whole thing falls apart at the end. Enjoyable on these terms alone but nothing more than all the other films just like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What you'd expect from such a cheap title.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cast List: Plesiosaurus, Pterodactyl, Diplodocus, Allosaurus, Triceratops, Ceratosaurus, Styrachosaurus, Paranthodon.Basically this movie is trashy but anyone looking at the cover can forsee that so why bother? Not only are the effects, or costumes monumentally terrible but the story manages to keep up. Instead of avoiding any complexity by just tossing some random species from various evolutionary stages and continents around the globe in an isolated island and showing people getting eaten alot they try to get scientifically clever but see how this grabs you, It's laughable to bother with this warning but for legal purposes I have to, SPOILERS AHEAD!Get this right, human beings (primitive ones) are actually processing dinosaur eggs by dropping them into the river and when they wash up on shore the animal grows and over time undergoes every evolutionary change within this one land. Forget the skipping of the natural selection and multi-million year factor, Aligators have to constantly adjust thier nests for temperature, because a few degrees can be the difference between life or death for the kid, dropping a brand new reptile egg into water would instantly render the embryo dissolute. On enterring the land the further you head into it the more primitive the animals are. And the same question that can be put on everything from the original Lost World novel to 1 million BC, why are the humans there at all, there are more than 5 dozen million years of evolution between the dinosaur age and the first humans. But really why bother with all this Scientific stuff, the movie sinks itself in every other area anyway, story, acting, effects etc. One of the greatest unintentional comedies of all time. The only question is why did they fail to even surpass the Lost World and King Kong harryhausen jobs from the beginnings of cinema effects, those dinos at least looked like they were alive no matter how pathetic in appearance (stop motion animation), and all the dogma about lumbering mosters was more than a decade before this so whats with the latter depiction. This is interesting however as the last of it's kind before Star Wars revolutionised the effects industry, it is almost impossible to believe that this and Jurassic Park are only 18 years apart, think about it.1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another day stuck indoors, another film to watch. Having finally completed my Christmas shopping yesterday on a cold and foggy afternoon, I had nowhere else to go to escape "The Land That Time Forgot". Or rather, I had nothing else to watch.Doug McClure, that bastion of leading-man actors, leads a handful of Allied sailors sunk by a U-Boat somewhere in the Atlantic in 1916. Capturing the U-Boat (in a scene that defies logic and reason), they eventually find themselves on a strange island, apparently untouched by human hands. Together, they explore the land and discover dinosaurs and Neanderthals! Can they escape before becoming a permanent resident of the land that Time forgot? Despite being made few years before "Star Wars", these films are light-years apart in terms of special effects. The model shots are little better than anything you would expect to see in an episode of Gerry Anderson's "Stingray" and the creatures aren't much better either. When the T-Rex (I'm assuming that's what it was) was killed, it fell in the same way that zombies do when you kill them - frozen in mid-walk and collapsing, arms and legs held out like a sleeping cow that's been pushed over. Granted, the sets aren't too bad but the lousy acting and endless explosion noises (which all sound the same) do their best to ruin credibility and your enjoyment of the picture as a whole. Characters are neither believable or worthy of your sympathy as they fire their guns at seemingly anything that moves. In the end, I just didn't care if they got off the island or not and by the time the end came, I was more relieved than entertained.Costumes are authentic enough until the cavemen arrive and it is bear-skin bikinis and loin cloths all round. And although it was fairly obvious from their actions, you wouldn't have known that some characters were German from their accents. The whole thing just lacked some polish and cohesion, leaving the viewer confused in places and nonplussed in others. Overall, this film barely registers a ripple of excitement these days although you can find some small amusement in trying to work out where Colin Farrell is. I spotted his name in the credits and half expected a baby to appear with an Irish accent and suspect facial hair. Oh well. Nothing particularly great here to see then, but just about OK if you're eating your lunch and the weather is preventing further activity.</fullReview>
