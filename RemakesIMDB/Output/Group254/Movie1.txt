		<shortDescription>Looks like a Sci-Fi channel original movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't say I got too far into this movie. If you've ever seen a Sci-Fi original movie, that should give you some idea of what you're in for.The CGI dinosaurs are laughable; they all look like cartoon cut-outs, which is unforgivable considering the current state of CGI technology. The characters are cliché. The blood looks like raspberry jam. This wreaks of a low-budget production all around, and worse, it wreaks of low effort. The acting was better than the film's other aspects, but could not possibly hope to redeem it.I don't like writing bad reviews when I feel a genuine effort has been made, and/or that there was care for the material, but this feels entirely derivative (even keeping in mind that it's a remake) and hastily slapped together, like a cheap TV movie to fill an empty time slot.Just to be clear, no, this isn't a fun B movie that's aware of itself. It seems to want you to take it seriously, as ridiculous as that request may seem to the viewer. I give it 3 stars to offer the benefit of the doubt, as I was too bored to watch very much of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this -I've enjoyed this story since I was a child, and was looking forward to a more modern telling of it. Sadly, the acting was so forced, so deplorable, that it was actually painful to sit through this. Perhaps the movie actually improved toward the end -I'll never know. I wasn't able to handle watching this sad excuse for shovelware of a movie. I didn't go into this expecting a special-effects extravaganza. I just expected competent acting. I mean REALLY, when they insist on remaking movies, shouldn't they actually try to improve the performances? Sigh. I couldn't give it anything less than a 3 because the story itself is a timeless classic -the writing didn't fail here, the acting did. Not really worth the time. Thats about all I can really say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this movie as I have always liked C. Thomas Howell but unfortunately I can't say that I liked it. I can say that I watched it, but that's about it.I was able to sit through it and that may be the best that Howell can hope for. The dialog was a bit unimportant and even somewhat silly at times. The whole thing seemed like a compromise - which I am sure to some degree (as with anything under budget constraints) it was.There was no effort exhausted in building characters that you could care about or for that matter knew anything about. When someone got killed you just did not care - at all.The more fascinating and cerebral aspects of this story were completely glossed over or avoided altogether; although I did find it interesting that there was a brief discussion on the details of refining petroleum. which I had expected would be ignored (okay in movies I guess).Overall, it barely held my attention and came off as another lame Sci-Fi channel, low budget, bad CG feature.Don't get me wrong, there were some things to like, but I think in this case, Howell probably had his hands tied as far as time/money are concerned and more money/time could have been invested in script, effects and filming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most Sci-Fi fans are prepared to tolerate a movies more notable deficiencies provided that the film has an interesting plot with state-of-the-art CGI. That the quality of the special effects were little better than 1975 movie means that this film has nothing to commend it whatsoever. The 1 point is for the women. They looked good even if they weren't called upon to act. What is the point in Hollywood making films like this with a budget so small that the movie appeared to have been made in one afternoon. Indeed frequent shots of the submarine showed the same seagulls unmoved! If Burroughs weren't already dead I think seeing this film might have killed him anyway. Not even Tarzan in super-CGI could have saved this turkey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jurassic Park gone bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Land That Time Forgot", 2009, a new movie. I liked the sound of the title and the fact that it only came out this year made me anxious for an epic story. I didn't know what to expect else that it would be a adventure film. But oh my, what was I disappointed. At the moment that I'm writing this I'm still watching the movie, for about 25 minutes now. After the first 5 minutes I already saw the most horrible, forced acting I'd ever see. There is no suspense, no build-up to the plot. You're just thrown in between crappy plastic dinosaurs.This movie could've been great, it could've been the modern Jurassic Park if it weren't for a crappy script, even crappier acting and éven worse effects. And looking above my comment you'd see I'm not the only one who thinks this.So to sum it up, we have horrible acting, effects, dialogues and script. But there are two, no three things I can be positive about in this film; 1 - The camera quality is well done This means the quality of the screens, I do not mention the camera work like composition and capturing, those are as lame and uninspiring as can be.2 - The sound is nicely done Though the music is not very memorable, the sound effects of the dinosaurs etcetera are very well done. Really massive.. Too bad they come out of plastic children-toys dinosaurs..3 - The movie ends sometime, and I will never-ever have to watch it again! Woohoo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i think back at the 27 minutes of my life wasted on this movie....so many words come to mind....- Disappointment - Disbelief - Amazement - Shock....Someone financed and paid for this movie! What were they thinking? Who read the script and agreed to make this? If you have a limited budget, go out and make Blaire Witch 3, don't attempt to make a CGI extravaganza!!I love the post by Mark Ross. In my 27 minutes of viewing time, i did love the fact that the guy who fell off the cliff was covered in blood before he even hit the ground! For those who don't want to sit through the whole 27 minutes, just check out the first 5. Watch the people on board look amazed as they wake up from the storm to blue skies and calm oceans. Watch their faces as they scour the waterline for a small slice of hope before one cries out...there is land!! As the camera pans in on their profile as they talk, the island keeps moving. In one shot it is over their left shoulder, and then in the next it is over their right. I guess if you can believe that it has dinosaurs on it, you can also believe in an island that continually hops all over the place. The icing on the cake is the next shot has the boat about 30 meters from the island bearing down on them. I guess their engine was broken and it is easier for things to just happen rather than trying to explain them with some type of 'story line'.Ahhhh a lot can happen in 27 minutes. Watching any part of this movie isn't a wise use of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible update of a classic novel &amp; classic film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Land That Time Forgot starts late one night out on the open Ocean in the Bermuda Triangle during a raging thunder storm, a small boat with some holidaying tourists is caught up in the storm. Captain Burroughs (Timothy Bottoms) notices a strange bright light up ahead which the boats heads straight for... The next morning &amp; the storm has eased but the engine has broken down &amp; all of the on-board instruments appear broken too, stranded in the middle of the Ocean supposedly miles from anywhere the only hope the passengers have is a mysterious island they spot in the distance. They make it to the island &amp; go ashore where they discover all manner of Dinosaurs &amp; Prehistoric creatures, they also find other stranded humans on the island &amp; together they decide to work together to try &amp; get off the island &amp; back to civilisation...Directed &amp; starring C. Thomas Howell &amp; produced by the ever awful company The Asylum this is an adaptation of the Edgar Rice Burroughs novel which had already been adapted into the Amicus produced fun adventure monster film The Land That Time Forgot (1975) that starred Doug McClure &amp; quite frankly is ten times the film that this modern update is or ever will be. C. Thomas Howell is no stranger to ripping-off modern classics having already been responsible for War of the Worlds (2005) &amp; The Day the Earth Stopped (2008) which are also both terrible &amp; were also produced by the rip-off kings The Asylum. This is the type of awful low budget rubbish that regularly turns up on the Sci-Fi Channel as a bunch of bland lifeless character's get stranded on an island inhabited by a few Dinosaurs &amp; spend most of the film wandering around talking &amp; trying to get off th island. The zero budget means that the Dinosaurs get very little screen time &amp; the attack scenes are poor, they are very static as someone runs &amp; a T-Rex chases them, that's as exciting &amp; imaginative it gets I'm afraid. Towards the end of the film the surviving character's decide to escape the island on a submarine &amp; has to leave Howell behind but why didn't they just stop the submarine in the water &amp; wait for Howell? Aren't submarines able to stop? The original 1975 film is full of action &amp; adventure &amp; sure the effects are weak by todays standards it's so much more fun &amp; entertaining than this limp &amp; lifeless bore of a film that should be used as a cure for insomnia rather than for entertainment purposes.The whole production is cheap &amp; shoddy, despite being stranded on an island &amp; fighting off Dinosaurs everyones clothes stay clean &amp; never get ripped, their faces never become dirty &amp; their hair is always perfect &amp; despite being stranded on the island for years some of the character's have perfect teeth &amp; don't seem to need to shave. The CGI computer effects are pretty bad but I will admit they are not as bad as some of the CGI I have seen in films from The Asylum although that's very scant praise &amp; should not be considered as a positive. Despite an entire island there are very few Dinosaurs on show, there are two T-Rex's, a Pterodactyl &amp; something with a tentacle. I say something with a tentacle because we only ever see a single tentacle that one character wrestles with a bit before it lets him go for no apparent reason. There's a couple of mildly gory moments as someone is bitten in half &amp; there's a severed foot.Filmed in California in Malibu &amp; Long Beach apparently the locales don't look intimidating enough &amp; you never feel any atmosphere or danger, I mean where's the erupting Volcano that destroys the island? The acting is bad, Howell seems uninterested, Timothy Bottoms seems lost while the guy who wrote this thing Darren Dalton has a fairly large role as Cole Stevens.The Land That Time Forgot is a terrible low budget sci-fi fantasy film with awful production values, sloppy action &amp; bad CGI Dinosaurs. Stick to the 1975 version as it's tens better than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is simply pathetic. Words can not express how poorly this movie was made. I watched it with my teenage daughter. Here are some of the things we noticed as we laughed through it.1. The Island contains roads. Who built them? 2. Why are the T-Rex's always hiding in the same place? 3. The male character in the blue shirt is always freshly shaved, therest of the men, including the Germans are scruffy. 4. When the team of men went into the cave, their torch apparently lititself. 5. The dinosaurs do not leave footprints, nor do they kick up dirt/dustas they walk. 6. When the first man dies, you can clearly see he is bloody before hehits the ground from his fall. 7. When the skipper fills the water jug, you can see water spilling outof it as he runs. When he stops running, the bottle is corked. 8. The blonde woman speaks about ten words after she is rescued. 9. When the men were hiding in the cave, they had several minutes torescue the blonde women who was tied up. For whatever reason, theywaited behind cover for her captures to return before making their move. 10.The brunette actress has perfect make-up, hair and clothes throughthe entire movie. Everyone else looks dirty. 11.The crew used Christmas lights to test the generator. Where did theycome from? 12.The man in the blue and white stripped shirt was eaten by a T-Rex,and cut in half, though there was no blood during his death scene. 13.The submarine had enough power (in reverse) to un-beach itself and return to the water.That movie was 90 minutes of my life I'll never get back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most boring and ridiculous movies I ever had the pleasure to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't have a problem with low budget movies. Cheap movies can be fun. This one however was ever so predictably and ridiculously brain dead that it made me write my first IMDb comment ever: Be warned. You will not be thrilled. You will not be entertained. You will hardly laugh about a few really stupid, endlessly repeated T Rex attacks. The effects are hardly existent. The scenery is made mostly of stock material cut together in the worst possible way. And the actor's lines sound like they are computer generated. If you should speak German or are a German and watch it in the original version you might have a laugh or two about the stupid Eastern European accent of the German soldiers later in the movie, but believe me, this isn't worth it. Stay away from this crap or you will throw away 90 minutes of your life time. One of the worst and most boring movies of all time!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A quality lost-on-deserted-island flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1975 version of Edgar Rice Burroughs' "The Land that Time Forgot" with Doug McClure featured lame puppet-type dinosaurs, but made up for it with well-developed characters and a huge subtext, which was surprising for such a seemingly simple story.This made-for-TV 2009 version changes everything and I'm sort of glad because we already have the original that followed Burroughs' book pretty faithfully. The only similarity between this version and Burroughs' story is that there's an uncharted island, castaways, Germans, a U-boat and dinosaurs. That's it. This version features some sort of dimensional gateway where modern people and others from the last century meet on Caprona, the island. They try to figure out how to escape, how to get along and how to contend with dinosaurs, mostly a T-rex. Speaking of which, the T-rex doesn't look too bad for this type of micro-budget sci-fi, just don't expect "Jurassic Park" quality (although the story's arguably better and this version definitely has better women).C. Thomas Howell directed the film and is also a member of the likable cast. I appreciate the camaraderie that develops between the Americans and the Germans. Speaking of which, the WWI Germans are pretty convincing.As far as women go, Lindsey McKeon is the highlight as a shapely brunette, but there's also a good-looking blond (Anya Benton).FINAL WORD: Although it doesn't follow Burroughs' book at all, this 2009 TV version of "The Land that Time Forgot" is a worthwhile lost-on-a-deserted-island flick in the tradition of "Mysterious Island (Widescreen)" and others, like "Planet of the Dinosaurs". If you enjoy movies of this ilk, you'll probably appreciate this one.The film runs 90 minutes and was shot in Griffith Park, Los Angeles, Long Beach and Malibu, CA.GRADE: B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A study in how not to do it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watch a movie like this, I become increasingly aware of the filmmaking behind the film itself. I watch chase scenes that have nothing chasing the people and I imagine the director trying to give motivation, "You're running," and the camera bounces around to accentuate the manic running through the trees. Even the score builds frenetically at that point, to emphasize the urgency of the chase.Yet, there was no dinosaur chasing them. There was no attempt at a composite shot of any kind. There was a one-second shot of what may have been the standard Tyrannosaurus Rex, but even that blip of imagery doesn't make it into the chase scene.The animated dinosaurs don't looks as convincing as those the Discovery Channel has been showing for the past decade, never mind the ones in Jurassic Park back in 1993. I think it's been shown too many times in the past that a lot can be made with just a little, but there was no creative spirit behind the effects in this film to bring the scenes to life. Sadly, I think quadrupling the budget would have had no impact on the effect of the way the dinosaurs were used.If you like lame adventure movies, this is watchable as a point of reference along the long history of such movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First the good: This wasn't nearly as bad as Greg Evigan's Journey to the Center of The Earth or 100 Million BC. But it was worse than crap like Transmorphers and Terminators.For anyone who may want to kill an hour and a half watching this, I'd recommend pulling out the 1975 Doug McClure classic instead. That movie you could watch time and again and enjoy despite the dated effects of that film.Matter of fact any of the Doug McClure classics are worth it. Still waiting for Warlords of Atlantis to come out on DVD for US.The only good: a German U-Boat and adding survivors from different time periods on the island which could have provided some interest.I feel bad for C. Thomas Howell, he used to be good but has now been relegated to B-Movie Hell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fails as both an adaptation and remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are worse movies than this, including within the "lost world" genre it is a part of. I suppose that is the most praise I can give the 2009 film adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs' "The Land That Time Forgot".While the previous 1975 film was by no means devoid of flaws, it has a charm that hasn't gone away despite recent prehistoric CGI-enhanced epics like the "Jurassic Park" films. Only the best films of the dinosaur/ lost world movie genre make you feel like you're a kid while watching them, and the '75 film is one of them. It does not possess the kind of technical wizardry of stop-motion classics like "One Million Years B.C." (1966) or "The Lost World" (1925), but it is a very fun movie that is a fairly faithful adaptation of the book (which I have read).The 2009 movie features shoddy CGI effects which make one miss the puppets and men in suits from the earlier film. The effects here are perhaps suitable as "previsualization" FX shots, but generally don't hold up to much scrutiny: the dinosaurs have extremely limited movement capability, and their skin and mouths look extremely fake. I think the best rendered-creatures were the giant dragonfly (cleverly filmed a good distance away from it) and carnivorous Pterodactyls, while generally the T-Rex was pretty hard on my eyes.The original film and book took place on a giant lost continent called Caprona; the interior was lush and tropical. The '75 film was shot at a variety of exotic locales including the Canary Islands, plus utilized Shepperton Studios to realize Caprona on the big screen. This film settles for dry Southern California, and takes significant detours from the original book and film- including no mention I can recall of "Caprona" itself.I don't feel anyone out of the cast particularly shined or slumped, but I do wish C. Thomas Howell had been able to anchor the movie more effectively. He makes a poor successor to Doug McClure, who was far more effective as a protagonist and was too macho to spend over half the movie looking worried or freaked out.There are certainly worse films out there, but this one is really only for fans of Z-grade cinema. Watch it with extremely low expectations and try to appreciate it in a "so bad it's good" kinda way, and you might have an OK time.</fullReview>

Directed and starring C Thomas Howell that tells you all you have to know . Add to this it's produced by Asylum it tells you even more and it's going to be a challenge of meeting the ten line criteria for this site Supposedly based on Edgar Rice Burrough's adventure novel you get the impression no one who had worked on the film had read the novel . You don't think they might have seen the 1975 film version either . Instead you think the production team got invited in to the studio execs office and told "It features a shipwreck with people getting washed up on a strange island that has dinosaurs and a German U-boat crew . Now go and make a movie" . It's fairly obvious that no one was under any pressure to make a good film , or even stretch themselves in to making something ambitious enough to be mediocre . Despite all the faults of the prior film at least it was brilliantly entertaining and the lost land of Caprona did have an unearthly mystique to it . Here we have a film that is terminally boring and a location that never gives the impression that it wasn't filmed on some shoreline in California .

		<fullReview>After watching this movie, I had to critique it, because thats what I like to do. The screenwriter could have built in some more character development, up dating it more than the book and previous movie attempt. Some of the dialog seemed written by elementary school kids. Nevermind that last comment, elementary school children could have been more creative. The acting was as believable as a high school play. Scratch that too! My sons acting was better in his 5th grade play. Now the biggie...the CGI was equal to the effects of the 1974 version of this move. With that said, why couldn't it have been better? Remake the movie with Jason Statham as Frost, Brad Pitt as Cole Stevens and Megan Fox as Lindsey Stevens. Get the people who did Jurassic Park to do the CGI and the producer, screen writer and director from Transformers. That might be a good example of improvements, but don't let that Avitar guy get his hands on it...as it will be over-rated and almost as lousy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A straight to video version of Edgar Rice Burroughs' classic novel. This screenplay is by Darren Dalton, who also stars as one of the shipwrecked castaways that awaken on a strange island after their ship is lost at sea during a storm. The mysterious island is shared by man-eating dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures. Captain Burroughs(Timothy Bottoms)and his stranded mates will come upon survivors from other shipwrecks, that includes a stranded German U-Boat crew that still believe they are fighting a war. Far from outstanding dialog and mediocre CGI should ward viewers away, but for some reason I stuck with it. Other players are Lindsey McKeon, Stephen Blackehart, Anya Benton, David Stevens and C. Thomas Howell, who also wore the director's hat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Land That Time Forgot (2009)* 1/2 (out of 4) The Asylum adapts the famous Edgar Rice Burroughs novel about a group of people who get stranded on an island and soon realize that they're not alone. As with the Burroughs story, there are dinosaurs on this island but an added touch are some Nazis who don't realize that WWII is over. If you've never seen the 1975 version of this then it's best that you start there and leave this one here alone. This film doesn't have too much in common with the previous film or even the Burroughs novel for that matter but instead it's just a cheap excuse for The Asylum to make some cash. While this version is without question a bad movie I'd stop from calling it a horrible one. C. Thomas Howell acts in the film but he also directed it and considering the budget he had to work with I think he did a fine job. I thought the film flowed a lot better than you'd expect and it certainly looks more professional than a lot of the stuff that the studio puts out. Timothy Bottoms also offers up a good performance and the rest of the cast are good enough. With that said, everything else is pretty much a waste but I do think a bigger budget could have helped things. It turns out that the various survivors got on the island after going through the Bermuda Triangle and this includes some U.S. and German soldiers from WWII. I found this here to be an interesting touch and it's really too bad more wasn't done with it. The CGI dinosaurs look incredibly bad and I think it's safe to say that the effects in the 1975 version are much better (even when they weren't that great to begin with). Fans of the novel or the previous film should probably just stay clear of this because there's really not much of a connection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Narrative the Movie Forgot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A boatload of castaways enter a time warp on an uncharted island.I'm curious whether the screenplay was put together in a dark room or by committee, because the narrative is about that coherent. Why bother with segues or motivation or even exposition. The story, such as it is, simply lurches from one occurrence to the next and you get to fill in the blanks. Other reviewers have cleverly detailed the carload of minor missteps, but the narrative itself is about as woeful as guys who don't bleed even when bitten in two. Then again, what can you expect from a production outfit that dubs itself "The Asylum". I've got to admit the best? and maybe only?good part are the two girls traipsing around in their shorts. At least, they got that right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey, it's Timothy Bottoms! And he's not playing George W. Bush! But if I were stuck on an island full of dinosaurs with George W. Bush, he would act exactly like this! Hey, it's C. Thomas Howell! A long damn way from "The Outsiders"! And he looks emaciated! Hey, C.! Have a sandwich! Hey, it's that gal from "One Tree Hill"! She can't act here, either! Hey, it's an Asylum movie! But this time, the story's not so bad! This time the effects are passable! This time the direction is competent! C. Thomas Howell was the director! He still needs a sandwich! Hey, it's better than Will Ferrell's "Land of the Lost"! Hey, slamming my fingers in a drawer is better than Will Ferrell's "Land of the Lost"! Five stars, because the Nazi U-Boat (don't ask) looks pretty cool!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>T-Rex blues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What has happened to C. Thomas Howell that he appears in dreck like this, a remake or a low-budget 1975 British flick? He even directed this thing! A group of castaways on an island in the Bernmuda Triangle must contend with a constantly hungry and angry T-Rex and a bunch of lost Germans and their broken U-boat. The T-Rex is a typical SyFy Channel creation, which means it is very bad CGI. The acting, with the exception of Tim Bottoms as a crusty captain, is second-rate. As bad as the 1975 version is, and it is truly awful, this makes that one look downright Shakespearean. "Land" author ER Burroughs must be spinning in his grave whenever this plays. His last name is even misspelled on the poster/video cover!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that time should forget...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen worse from Syfy/The Asylum, but really is it saying much? This is a very poor film, both as an adaptation and on its own merits. I haven't seen the 1975 film in some time, but I do remember it being much better than this.The whole movie looks shoddy, the scenery looks tacky, the editing is sloppy and the whole picture quality has a rather grainy feel to it. The effects are not as bad as other Syfy movies, but they are still pretty cheap-looking.That leads me to a big problem I had with the film. I did like seeing the dinosaurs, despite not being impressed entirely by how they looked, but not only are they underused there are not enough of them. And because there are little or no thrills and suspense, despite them meaning to be a pivotal part of the story, you had the impression they were just there with no reason to be.Pacing is another issue, again because of the lack of build ups, suspense and thrills and because of the sluggish pace and some pointless and overlong expositions, the whole film feels like a dull affair.Add to that bad direction, a good idea of a story explored very badly, poorly written characterisation and cheesy scripting and you have an even duller affair. I forgot the acting, which was really poor, including a visibly embarrassed Timothy Bottoms.Overall, not Syfy's worst but still a mess. 2/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poor old C Thomas Howell (or "C" as I like to call him). Perhaps his career would have been a little less lacklustre if he'd called himself "Tom Howell". But the "C" always comes across as a bit pretentious, don't you think? So after starting off with a bang - the original The Hitcher - and then dropping into what appeared to be a never-ending series of straight-to-video sleazy sex dramas, usually with Joan Severance, he seems to have dropped into a rut of featuring in rubbishy low budget remakes of sci-fi classics.The Land That Time Forgot is one such rubbishy low budget remake - at least C earns a bit more in his pay cheque, being as how he directs this one.The scenery is nice and brightly photographed.That's it. Nothing else positive to say.And C's face, once so fresh and pretty, is looking a bit lined and leathery these days. Sorry about the career, C.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a fan of cheesy creature features and this ranks right up there, I mean, come on, it IS a cheesy creature feature! I don't expect to be riveted to my seat or witness award winning acting when I rent or buy something along the line of "The Land that Time Forgot". We aren't talking Gone with the Wind here. This is a mindless romp of fantasy, and adventure, something to watch on a rainy afternoon, or late at night when you can't sleep. I enjoyed C. Thomas Howell and the others just fine. I don't know if they were taking themselves too seriously or not, it was entertaining, that's all I care about. I was actually surprised after it was over, it was better than I thought it was going to be.If you are truly a die-hard fan of the "B" cheese, I think you'll enjoy C. Thomas Howell's version of The Land that Time Forgot. I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and sad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really loved the book this was based upon, and will not see the movie based on these horrible reviews. The 1975 version was fairly loyal to the original plot, but was also no match for the eloquent prose. What I found funny and sad was the poster advertising the movie. It said: "Edgar Rice Burrough's The Land That Time Forgot." If the studio doesn't even have someone available to proofread the author's name (Burroughs, not Burrough), you know it's in trouble. Perhaps they could do some other remakes: "Jurrasick Park" by Michael Crouton or "If" by Steven King. Nice to see C. Thomas Howell keeping his crown as king of the B-movies, though. Now that's what I call an Outsider.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst piece of movie cheese I've seen in a LONG time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want back the time I wasted on this movie. I want back the expectation that I was watching a remake of the older classic starring Doug McClure. This movie was so horribly done, I have to wonder why anyone would even bother. Who was pretending to be a director or producer here?I don't even know where to start. Maybe the 1990s Saturday morning cartoonish dinosaurs. Maybe the horrible play-acting and over-acting. Maybe the script and dialog that at times don't even make sense. Maybe the bizarre music that didn't even fit the plot most of the time (I felt like I was listening to an opera while watching a horror movie). Maybe the fake-gravelly-whisperish voice of the boat captain. Maybe the lack of character development. Maybe the insertion of subtle sexual hints at totally inappropriate moments. Maybe the fact that it's obviously the same ridiculous Sci-Fi Channel filler trash that we've come to expect from a channel that used to be a legitimate place to watch classic and new sci-fi and has instead turned into a cartoon factory.I guess what I'm saying is, don't even bother to watch this movie. It will be the most unpleasant lost two hours of your life. Don't even bother. I hate to be a hater, but this really is the biggest waste of remaking time and expense I've ever seen. But then since the expense was obviously minimal, I guess time was only thing really lost here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the worst movies I have ever seen. How do you have a gun fight with 2 groups of people literally 10 feet apart and no one gets shot and then just get up and run past your enemies and everyone stops fighting? It made no sense at all, the acting sucked, the characters sucked, the plot sucked, the story sucked, and everything C. Thomas. Howell does has always sucked, bad.People keep saying it's not that bad and/or a good cheesy movie... no definition of *good* can be added to this movie in any way unless you are being sarcastic or outright lying. It's not even worthy of the title of *B* movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't make it past the first 15 minutes - it was that awful. And then I realized it was an Asylum film. Once I realized that, I actually started finding these other reviews funny. It's an Asylum film. They, by their own admission, only produce crap films that they easily recoup costs for because they hardly spend any money producing them, and they use titles from older films or really similar ones that fool people into thinking it's the same story. And this movie isn't really the same story as the real Land That Time Forgot - yeah its got shipwrecks and dinosaurs, but beyond that, there isn't even a story to begin with (or end with).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Asylum= Thrash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was hoping a few years back that this new Company Asylum was to be a sort of new Hammer Films, for the LA underground scene of the new Millennium: but after watching a few movies, i quickly realized how pedestrian, amateur, and vulgar these non films are! There's virtually no redeeming virtue,no attempt to make anything at least with some visual style or interesting innovative take! It is just a land of despair, where all actors desperately trying to make a living are exploited in characters without any development, the supporting cast is made by stunt players or,if by any chance,there was anybody good (like in another film,called "Countdown:Jerusalem", so bad and convoluted,to make hardly any sense at all,and, where, had sadly noticed that while, most supporting roles were given to experienced actors virtually set up to failure, almost mocked by having to portray with their usual professional intensity,non roles,the leads,instead, were played by some people who looked honestly had never even acted before,or, most likely never even thought to pursue acting at all!) you can be sure they'd almost hide her/his presence, since it seems that any artistic requirement in this new type of filmmaking, is to be bashed and condemned! Art direction,Costumes and especially make up are normally also so wildly bad,ridiculous and just so wrong, that even an Ed Wood movie,by comparison, could get Awards,next to this ugly boredom. I must say that if anybody deserves praise,here, then i should mention the Editors of these 'so called features', since it is obvious they work with material that looks less inspiring than 7 days old garbage, and still always try to cut it with some professional talent, in order to avoid complete disaster! Why making films like this? I hear there are so many talented filmmakers out there, unemployed, and yet, the once fun Sy/Fy Channel, now has decided to give most of their production to this inept,lazy, vulgar Film Company, that gives a bad name to Genre films,and just during a time when such movies had just been rediscovered from the past, and brought back with a new sense of style and creativity by a few interesting new independent directors, who strive instead to get funded. It's insulting to watch such ridiculous nonsense, sad to see money spent this bad, and worrying to think major cable channels have deals to make more of this Z grade standard degraded 'cinema'! Do yourself a favor and spend some money in some older&amp;greater Euro B exploitation flick's in DVD, or in some American campy ones from 20/30 years ago, but leave this deconstructive crap alone! Avoid the massacre of what was once called adventurous filmmaking! There's nothing adventurous here, just desolation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am watching it NOW. Someone kill me please. Either this or Curling on CNBC. I disagree with one reviewer. The acting is not bad. There is no acting. Right now, there is a commercial for Pompton Lakes Shoping. Unfortunately it's almost 10 p.m. or I would be there. I am used to the drek you often get on SiFi. Sometimes it's actually fun. When you get that "tongue in cheek," attitude, it redeems an otherwise bad movie, since you know that the writers and cast agree that it sucks. Case in point, "The Basilisk," It's when they get all serious and "Speilberg," that you must turn away or go blind. Right now, there's a CGI T-Rex, trying to eat someone. "Go get 'em boy." Back to Curling and may the best rock win.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow...Really, no I mean Really this movie sucks. I registered and wrote my first comment because of it. I am really thinking of destroying my computer for making such a crime as putting it on it. The movie contains many and many mistakes. First, What the hell are they doing on the boat ? who are they ? there is no damn information at all, just people on a boat stuck on a storm. yeah, it could work, but they made it in a way I never thought possible.Secondly, Let's just skip some parts and speak about the So called T-Rex. Am I supposed to believe that is a dinosaur ? I mean in compared to the movie and the environment that he is in, he exactly looks like a toy, especially when he opens his big mouth, will you look at that. Another thing is he always in the same spot ? and whenever they go, they stand on the road (Who the Hell Made that Road ?? ) In exact same spot, then through a rock, which fells on the ground, then he appears from nowhere!! One more thing, did they expect to only find one T-Rex ? I mean they were totally sure that If you kill that one, The island is ours to Rule. Which brings me to my third point.The explosives used on the dinosaurs, Wow Is that an explosion ? It doesn't look real at all, Also it's used a lot not in a good way.Fourth and lastly because I can't allow this movie to waste more time from life, The music and the scenes with only background music and they are moving, are too many and useless in many cases. Even the music isn't epic or anything. Last question, WHAT THE HELL WHERE THEY DOING ON THE BOAT !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought "the land that time forgot" was a wonderful movie! first of all, I love dinosaurs,so maybe I am prejudice. The actors in the film were economical with their screen time. there were plenty of t-Rex shots, (although I could have seen a few more of the other animals shown: giant dragonflies, hawks, flying lizards, sea monsters, rats) nice use of dramatic audio, scenery, plot twists and turns, inventive anecdotes, character development. I thought it was great and I cant believe I haven't heard more people talking about it. that's all. just wanted to represent the other side of the scale, since all these "Debbie Downers" have given it such poor reviews. The CG I effects used are becoming outdated, but i read that as a throw-back to the history of the film, since it is a re-do, they were charming actually. I just wish I knew if the submarine or the ship made it out of the vortex, or if they were lost in oblivion. but that leaves it open for the sequel: "Back to the Land That Time Forgot" and I didn't even spoil the ending! enjoy!</fullReview>
