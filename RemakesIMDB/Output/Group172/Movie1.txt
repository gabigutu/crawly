		<shortDescription>Another Pointless Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This perfectly serviceable remake of the 1977 picture raises the question as do so many remakes, of why this was remade. The scene is changed from the Upper West Side to West Greenwich village, but other than that, it looks like the leads worked on their characterizations by looking at the earlier film -- and the originals do it ever so slightly better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a good sweatpants/ice-cream movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a made for TV movie, for goodness sake. If I were home alone on a Saturday night, I would really enjoy this movie--what is wrong with a movie simply being entertaining? I haven't seen the original, so maybe that is why you all hate it so much, but as for simple acting jobs, I thought that the little girl has actually really improved her acting skills and was nice and natural, with good comic timing. And Daniels was quite charming. I wasn't as crazy about P.Heaton as I normally am, but I think that that was a product of the way her character was written. And I was glad to see Alan Cumming do something light, too. Anyway, in general, it was enjoyable, and I would recommend it for a no fuss night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildly enjoyable fluff...but why make it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is almost impossible to watch this movie, without comparing it to the 1970's movie. Jeff Daniels does a servicable job in this role, but to my eyes he seems miscast. He is just not desperate or manic enough in this part. Patricia Heaton is actually an upgrade over Marcia Mason in the female lead.This is just an odd film to remake. The original was not exactly out of date. They did not make any big changes in this version, except very minor mentions of more current events. If you are bored, the source material this comes from is still pretty good. However if you really enjoy this movie, take the time to rent the 1977 version. I promise you will appreciate it being better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have both the 2004 and 1977 versions on my TiVo, and the former is a scene-for-scene remake of the latter. It's interesting to see the small changes in the scenes from the two movies. Like in the "morning after" breakfast scene where the 1977 Lucy's Bicentennial lunchbox (remember 1976? remember lunch boxes), is replaced in 2004 with today's over-sized book backpack. Also, the 1977 Lucy had a Habitrail (TM) for her hampster -- still available today, but alas, not in the 2004 set. Of course, political correctness is evident in the 2004 version -- the 3 black purse-snatchers in 1977 are replaced by 3 white purse snatchers in 2004. In more evidence of progress, the 2004 rooftop dinner has much more Christmas lights than the 1977 version. Similarly, the Subaru in the 1977 auto show scene gets 39 mpg, while the Toyota in the 2004 auto show gets 60 mpg.The best thing I can say about the 2004 version is that Patricia Heaton looks better in the role though 10 years older than Marsha Mason at the time of shooting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the original. This remake was just painful. Try though he might Jeff Daniels could not carry off the roll of Elliot with any degree of charm, humor or frenetic energy that Richard Dreyfuss made work so well in the original. Matthew Perry MIGHT have been a better casting choice for Elliot, but it's hard to follow a classic. And though Patricia Heaton is much easier on the eye than Marsha Mason ever was, she seemed to be phoning in her part as well. Marsha sold the part of a hopeless romantic who'd been dumped one too many times. Patricia seemed to be acting like it was one of her Albertson's commercials. I really tried to cheer for this remake, but it just didn't hold a candle to the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake just does not live up the the original. No chemistry between the leads, and I can't remember the last time I've seen cleavage (obviously silicone) that was too high on the female leads chest. And she wasn't even a pleasure to look at. The male lead, what's his name, seemed invisible to me in the role.Do yourself a great favor and rent the original instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Patricia Heaton is the only reason to watch this movie. The kid in the movie was a bit too old to be so cute, and Jeff Daniels performance was less than his best. The acting seemed a little forced and unnatural especially Daniels and the kid. The movie needed more attention paid to Daniels' and Heaton's sexual tension to make the romantic connection that ultimately occurs more believable. It seems the romantic connection occurs more out of desperation that love. I admire Heaton for attempting this role, but it was only her sexy outfits that made this movie endurable. The often-conservative housewife from Everybody Loves Raymond expanded her role capabilities by showing how beautiful and sexy a middle-aged women can be, too bad it was wasted on this remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining? yes, even if unbelievable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What got me to watch this movie in the first place was seeing Patricia Heaton in something other than Everybody Loves Raymond and to see Jeff Daniels in something a little more serious than Dumb and Dumber.I won't give away any of the plot, but I will say that the movie was entertaining. Although the speed at which emotions changed back and forth was a little too quick to be believable. Some people also might be turned off by the overly mature NYC 10 year old daughter who at times seems to be more of a sister then a daughter to Heaton's character.It was a nice film to end the day with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was dumb.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wish I had a better word than "dumb" for this movie, but it's the one that fits. The modern adaptation of The Goodbye Girl was an absolute joke. Besides being a remake in the most literal (and lazy) sense (practically every camera angle was identical to the 1977 original), it had badly casted characters and, due to the use of a practically untouched script, many highly unlikely situations in the modern world.To start, Patricia Heaton is horribly miscast. Her inability to "find a good man" is unbelievable- with her boob job, she should be beating men off with a stick. In addition, she didn't do anything we weren't used to seeing; frankly, I'm tired of seeing Patricia Heaton play the embattled housewife. Very boring.Jeff Daniels was a slightly better fit (less creepy than Richard Dreyfus), but his slooooooow delivery and lackluster performance left much to be desired.Poorly acted and poorly translated to modern times. Stick with the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why bother?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why did they remake this picture? It was a pleasant enough TV movie if there was not a really excellent original to which it pales in comparison.Jeff Daniels, usually a favorite of mine, is not cut out for this type of comedy. He is neither funny or sympathetic as Elliot. Patricia Heaton is OK, but there is virtually no chemistry between her and Daniels. The daughter is too cute and wise.Oddly, a high point in this picture is a cameo by director Richard Benjamin. This production makes one want to go back into the archives and retrieve the Dreyfuss/Mason version to REALLY see the show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was good but not great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought Patricia Heaton did a fantastic job as Paula but No1 was as good as Richard Dreyfuss. They could have done a better job with the casting of Elliot too. Jeff Daniels was mediocre @ best. I also liked the daughter in this one better. The script was almost verbatim &amp; it was still funny but I wasn't rolling &amp; laughing so hard my sides hurt like I did when I first saw the 1977 version. As my title says: it was good but not great. They could have done a LOT worse. Look how horribly musicals like Best Little Whorehouse in Texas ; for one; the movie totally sucked. The musical was much better. All in all I give this remake of a classic a 6. I like how they modernized it too although it didn;t fit in the original plot. IE: Elliot first tries to use his cell phone . Then he drops it &amp; breaks it. They didn't have cell phones in 1977. They were also talking a lot about revivals &amp; improvs which are much more common now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After I saw a little clip before the movie was shown, I thought the movie was going to be good; however, I guess my expectations were a bit too high. The movie was horrible and it had a mediocre plot line. Jeff Daniels and Patricia Heaton did not connect at all. I thought Lucy was way too smart for her age so it seemed a bit unrealistic. It seemed to me that Patricia Heaton fell in love with Jeff Daniels a bit too fast. One minute they are avoiding each other, and then the next scene you see the two in a bathroom making out. The movie barely had any funny parts with the exception of two events.Overall, the move just seemed stupid after a bit watching it and could have been revised much better than it was shown as a television movie.</fullReview>

She didn't seem to feel her role. She didn't seem very into it with her emotions. Jeff Daniels and her didn't really connect well. I would not recommend this movie to a friend. I thought that it had its good parts. Jeff Daniels had his funny parts and Hallie Kate Eisenberg who played the role of Lucy McFadden also played her part well. She made you feel what it was like to be a young child in this kind of situation. This was not the kind of movie I would go out of my way to watch.

		<fullReview>I found this movie to be both unrealistic and unfunny. Patricia Heaton and Jeff Daniels made for one of the worst couples I've ever seen in a movie. There was poor chemistry between the two. I thought that the idea of these two people falling in love with each other was funnier then the film itself. Having said that, the lone highlight of the film is Hallie Kate Eisenberg as the young Lucy McFadden. She was the funniest aspect of this film. I also found Alan Cumming as the play director to be quite humorous. But the few laughs I had while watching this would not be enough to recommend this to anyone. This movie should not be meant for anything other than a bad Lifetime movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although i found The Goodbye Girl cute and entertaining, I do not think the acting was sufficient. Patricia Heaton plays a character who possesses extreme emotions and she was not able to carry out this role successfully. Most of her feelings looked too fake. Because of this it was very hard for the audience to feel compassion for her. Also, I personally do not like unrealistic movies and I felt the plot was very unrealistic. Two complete strangers comfortable with living together in New York City is just ridiculous. I did, however, think Jeff Daniels fit his character and was funny especially with his awkward body movements and his one-liners.</fullReview>

You could easily tell her actions and emotions seemed to be "forced". I didn't like how she complained about every single flaw in her life and depended on everyone else. I have some advice for her "get some acting lessons". As for Jeff Daniels, he is a much better actor than Patricia Heaton. Though I didn't like his character in the movie, i still think his acting was good. Hallie Kate Eisenberg is a decent actor. I liked how she seemed more mature and in control than her mom at times. I feel that this movie is not recommendable on any level. It didn't keep my attention from the very start.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an awful movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2005 remake of the film "The Goodbye Girl", was one of the worst movies I have ever seen and would not recommend this movie to anyone. I did not like this movie because the actors in this case being Jeff Daniels and Patricia Heaton had no chemistry. The movie didn't flow well at all it was like swimming through syrup. Another reason why this movie was bad is because the plot line of these two complete strangers all of sudden living together and then falling in love is so unrealistic its disgusting. The lone bright spot in this movie was Hallie Kate Eisenberg who played Lucy McFadden. She gave off a good sense of what it is like being a child of a single parent. She played her role very well. Besides that blip of goodness this movie was awful and I would not suggest wasting your time watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was good at first. I loved the beginning of this movie, where Paula is an angry and bitter woman who has just been dumped on by her boyfriend. I loved the whole opposites attract thing she and Elliot had going on in the movie. The movie just took a different turn when Elliot professed his love to Paula. This made watching the movie a little painful with all the love scenes after huge arguments between the two. Lucy was a very interesting character. I liked the way she had the mind of a forty year old woman in such a young body. I also liked the way people talked. It gave you a sense of actually living in New York, where everyone speaks fast.

Especially the buffo part. I liked how fast the dialog went. Not to fast that it was hard to understand but not to slow either.

		<shortDescription>Remake of the 1977 film, falling short of the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jeff Daniels ("Dumb and Dumber." 1994) and Patricia Heaton (T.V.'s "Everybody Loves Raymond") team up in this made-for-TV remake of Neil Simon's 1977 original. Elliot Garfield (Daniels) is forced to share an apartment with Paula (Heaton), and her 11ish-year-old daughter, Lucy (Hallie Kate Eisenberg--the "Pepsi girl" of the late '90s). At first there is incredible housemate static, but as time passes feelings for each other begin to surface.I actually saw the movie premiere in an Ann Arbor, MI historical theater. Daniels himself gave the introduction. Some dialogue seems forced, especially from Eisenberg. And the shared apartment is quite unbelievably luxurious for two, supposedly strapped-for-cash performing artists. Funny scenes and clever dialogue snippets save this romantic comedy, though the original is better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A river running in a deadly desert !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike many, I believe that remaking isn't a prohibited or bad thing. It's only in the way of it. Neil Simon wrote a screenplay entitled (The Goodbye Girl) which became a Herbert Ross movie in (1977). It was a great comedy with great performances. Now there is a new one. A TV one. So, based on the above, why not. However, after watching it, it's only "why" ?! First of all, they remade it with THE SAME screenplay. Regardless of saving the fee of new scriptwriter, that could be quite a challenge for the director to experience a different form in terms of making a creative remake a la Richard III (1995), or Romeo + Juliet (1996). Or it's just the same, yet with higher or ? at least ? as good performance. But you know what? Forget it utterly. Because this one ended up as uncreative and spooky instead ! The glaring touch of wit is so out. It's more like the original movie after emptying it of fun. For instance look at (Jeff Daniels). He does the role with silly flavor of seriousness, missing the extra vitality of the struggling cuckoo actor that (Elliot Garfield) is. (Patricia Heaton) is a major casting problem. Who selected her for god's sake ?! She looks old (older than her co-star), annoying, with no magic. I don't know who's to blame for depriving her character of its ardor, loveliness and desperate romanticism; to be another soppy, totally undistinguished, divorced woman.You heard that dialog before, and here you are hearing it again, entirely, as the same as it was. I don't get bored of Simon's work, but here the soulless deliverance from all the parties forces to. When I see the lead jumps over the fire escape to reproach his love in the street, exactly like (Richard Dreyfuss) did in 1977's movie, I must yawn, moving my head in pity, grieving not understanding "why bothering yourselves making a déj? vu? This is an insult to you guys before being the same to us!" There is nothing new except being dull. Well, to be fair it had 3 new things already; a poster for (Brad Pitt) hanging on the wall, a delicate song before the end, and slightly (Hallie Kate Eisenberg) as (Lucy); she seemed more childish and less sophisticated unlike (Quinn Cummings) in the first movie, not reasons to re-watch this again though!Generally the forever fresh text runs on screen like a river in a deadly desert, with zero echoes. It's barely Neil Simon meets The Bold and The Beautiful. There is no beneficiary of anything, except some people get paid (for repeating poorly a rich thing), and some network gets something to fill out its empty hours ! I believe by now you caught on the reason why this movie is spooky; it's how it indicates insolvency all the way. The same money, which they produced this TV ghost with it, should have been spent over ANY OTHER PROJECT better. But obviously there wasn't ANY OTHER PROJECT in the first place!And when you watch, among flood of remakes, The Omen (1976) being remade into another one in (2006) under the same title by the same script of its original writer (David Seltzer) then you must notice how making movies in America lives in the 2000s a state of resorting to the 1970s, or any other creative decade, through many remakes, spooky ones with nothing new to be specific. The Conclusions : Simon's work fits to be watched many times, and this movie doesn't. Watch (The Goodbye Girl ? 1977), and avoid this TV version, sorry copy. Being a copy is enough pathetic, so how about that there is none to win from it, but appreciating the first movie more, along with detracting the 2000s more as well. It is not the goodbye girl inasmuch as the goodbye movie !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fabulous remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was brilliantly done. I confess that I've never seen the 1977 original, and it is no insult to the actors in that one to say that Jeff, Patricia, and Hallie are a fabulous trio in this film. Take this version as a standalone and you will be impressed! The comic timing is excellent; the emotion is vividly real in almost every scene; the chemistry is actually better early on, when it is more below the surface, than later in the film; and the casting could not have been more perfect.Jeff Daniels is particularly excellent as Elliot Garfield, with his artful blend of dry humor and simple passion. An actor playing an actor on screen is rarely demonstrated so well, but his charm keeps this character utterly believable. I was not a big fan of Patricia Heaton until she took this role, but I discovered a depth in her acting that was not as evident to me from her television work. It helps that she is obviously an intelligent woman, and she brings an endearing mix of tentative hope and cynicism to this character, just as she should. Hallie Kate Eisenberg, in her second role as an intelligent, rather mature child, is the perfect complement to Patricia's Paula McFadden. Hallie plays Paula's daughter in this film, more innocent and hopeful than her mother, but not a stranger to the world and its emotional threats. All three characters are very human, very real; and the intelligent, witty dialogue is so plausible that you almost feel you are being told this story by the characters themselves who are your personal friends.Overall, brilliantly made, perfectly cast, and a real delight! Fans of comedy, romance, and even biting wit, will all be charmed and impressed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the original, so I was very excited when I heard about the remake. I adore Patricia Heaton and being a hometown boy, I like Jeff Daniels. However, there is absolutely no chemistry between Heaton and Daniels. Elliot is supposed to be a struggling actor, which Dreyfus played to a "T". He had that scraggly, avant garde actor appearance. Jeff Daniels is way too clean-cut. Mason and Dreyfus are closer in height whereas Daniels is 6'3" and Heaton is 5'2. Completely awkward. Lastly, with the amazing screen chemistry was between Dreyfus and Mason, not to mention the fantastic performance by Quinn Cummings, I think this remake was doomed from the onset. It didn't help that TNT showed the original before airing the remake. Dreadful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shoulda left it alone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is another example of a movie/show that was perfect or near perfect in its original incarnation, and low and behold, some unoriginal "genius" has to come up with the brilliant idea to ruin it. It's funny, my wife and I just watched the video of the original 2 weeks ago, before we knew this was coming out. It was my wife's first time seeing the movie, and she loved it. 10 minutes into this lifeless remake, and we knew it was a mistake.First of all, you can NOT build upon or act against Richard Dreyfuss' original performance. Dreyfuss' Garfield was as near perfect a characterization as one could find. he was perfect and masterful. Daniels, while a fine actor, does not hold a candle in this role. The rest of the cast too appears to be sleep-walking through the lines. I'm sorry but, it just doesn't work. Patricia Heaton is obviously talented, and I love her on "Raymond" but she is out of her element here and it does not work. Hailey Eisenberg was cute to a point in the Pepsi commercials, but judging by her performance here, she shoulda hung 'em up afterwards. Blame can probably be placed justly on the directing, which is equally lifeless, and appears to not be capable of capturing the magic of the original.The only saving grace is, it's on TV, so it's free. Watch if nothing else is on, but otherwise, forget it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a pretty good remake of a movie that was perfect to begin with. I think Jeff Daniels made his own fabulous spin on the character of Elliot yet was able to still capture some of the original scenes with "Dreyfuss-Daniels" flair. Patricia Heaton also did a grand job. I wasn't as thrilled with the performance of Lucy but then again not everything could be perfect. She did a great job of embodying the character yet overall I'm not sure I took a great liking altogether to the actress. Kudos to Hootie for redoing the song by "Bread", as always an awesome classic. Overall if you enjoyed the original this was film was a nice breath of fresh air. As usual though on a late afternoon I'll always opt for some Dreyfuss meditation anyday.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why was this made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Goodbye Girl was a classic from the 70's starring Richard Dreyfuss,Marsha Mason and an excellent performance by a young Quinn Cummings. Dreyfuss won an academy award for his portrayal of Elliott Garfield a struggling actor trying to make it ,Mason as a jilted single mom and the delightful Cummings as her precocious daughter Lucy.For starters,why would you need to remake it in the first place and then disgrace it with a run of the mill TV movie of the week?. I'm not a big Jeff Daniels fan but even he deserves better ,he should have turned down the role- He is no Dreyfuss and watching him deliver the same lines is painful. Patricia Heaton(another irritating actress)is basically reprising her Everybody Loves Raymond's Debra character which isn't saying much(Why did she get nominated for a SAG award in the Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Movie or Miniseries category?,she was horrible- just goes to show you that SAG voters have bad taste). The little brat who plays Lucy is none other then Hallie Kate Eisenberg - if you don't remember her your excused.She was another sickeningly sweet little girl who did Pepsi commericals when Pepsi was trying to reinvent itself(snore).According to IMDb ,she is just adored by fans and is a regular guest on Leno. I don't watch Leno and could care less. Dakota Fanning could act circles around Eisenberg who has all the cuteness of a wet sponge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not like the goodbye girl at all. I thought it was a boring unrealistic movie. The acting by Patrica Heaton was horrible she did not play her part well and i think that she needs to find herself a different character in every movie/TV show she plays a housewife. I don't think that that is working for her anymore. The acting of Jeff Daniels was much better than Patrica Heaton.I thought Hallie Kate Eisenberg played her part very well as Lucy McFadden. I thought she was the funniest character in the movie. I also couldn't understand why Paula McFadden would let some stranger move into her house well actually his house but who does that. I thought this movie wasn't going to be that good because i knew that it was a TV movie and most TV movies aren't very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bad movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't like this movie. I think it was stupid, boring and unrealistic. The whole movie had a bad plot and a bad ending. There was no humor in the movie. There didn't seem to be any chemistry between the two of them. And so I don't think the acting worked for the movie. It was unrealistic because in the real world, if a single woman with a child had a man come to live with her that she didn't know, i don't think that she would let him in. They didn't know each other for that long, and every minute they were even near each other they were fighting or weren't together or talking. It doesn't seem like they would be able to fall in love that quickly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Goodbye girl was a bad movie. Patricia Heaton should stick to making Acme commercials, and Jeff Danniels should stick to what he is best at; making a fool out of him self in front of a camera with Jim Carrey. When Patricia Heaton's character, Paula cried i thought it looked looks completely unbelievable. Although I thought Jeff Danniels played his part well, i think if you want to see Jeff Danniels at his best, RENT DUMB AND DUMBER!!!!!!!!! He was able to portray his emotions to the audience, and showed what it is like to be an actor in New York City. Personally, I think that because the script was almost identical to that of original movie, that in this version some of the slang and actions of the character seemed outdated. If you are looking for a movie with originality or good acting this is not the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake cause heartache</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Patricia Heaton on "Raymond." When I heard she was playing Marsha Mason's role in the The Goodbye Girl" I thought it was casting genius and I am also fond of Jeff Daniels (his best work is the Woody Allen film: Purple Rose of Cairo) but I didn't see the two together.I watched with anticipation and understood in just a few minutes that they blew it. Every moment ached with mannequin-like performances even the little girl who is supposed to be a smart-Alic, is actually just smarter than the protagonist and her love interest, Daniels. This one made me angry because I kept watching thinking these two would somehow redeem themselves: but they drone on and on. Don't bother with this one: its a counterfeit. The real dollar bill is the Mason/Dreyfus version which is one of the sweetest stories on film. Remember! ...goodbye doesn't mean forever...unless you watch the Heaton/Daniels version of "The Goodbye Girl."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this is just bad....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had I not seen the 1977 picture first, I would have gone into this with an open mind. However, I had, and it was completely dreadful. Somethings in life shouldn't be remade. I love the Dreyfuss/Mason version because it's a bittersweet film, meant for those who love either the actors at their best or the genre. Anyway.....I heard about this being made and I thought it wouldn't be too bad. I mean Patricia and Daniels are quite talented. Contrary to belief, this TV movie was gutter material with second rate acting. They put the actors with the wrong characters, so it all seemed trash. They placed Alan Cumming, a very talented actor, in a very underhanded and under minded role, so we rarely see him use his creative juices. Same with Daniels. Patricia,who one could have done without with her pathetic Albertsons ads, would have been almost bearable in another film. Leave the '77 masterpiece alone, don't kill it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the Hootie song that was made for this remake so i watched the movie because I loved the original so much. This remake stunk though. I love the actors, but they literally did not fit the characters as much as the original actors did. The original characters were so much more believable in the parts. It was like the movie was made for them. I was so bored with this remake. I could watch the original over and over and over. Richard Dryfus' was so much of a believable character in the beginning and then I (the audience) fell in love with him right along with the mother and daughter. I think if the original was released again instead of this remake, it would have been loved by a new genration of people.</fullReview>

The part where he is meditating and going "Whoo boo boo boo" is suppose to sound like god, not Curly from the Three Stooges. There was nothing between Daniels and Heaton, no fire, no attraction, nothing. They went for all of the same lines and got nothing. On a scale of 10 I've never found a zero until now. What a joke. I do not see why they would remake this movie in the first place, Richard Dreyfuss is a very hard act to follow. Not to mention copy, Jeff Daniels should stick to movies he can handle.

		<shortDescription>A very pale imitation of the original film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who felt the need for a remake of "The Goodbye Girl"? The original film was fresh, witty, amusing, touching, and Academy Award winning, everything that this version is not! I began watching this with interest, thinking that it would be a charming version. I didn't finish it, and by the time I turned it off I was putting it in the same category of 'what were they thinking?!', along with Disney's remake of "The Music Man". The principals were at least ten years too old for the parts. Jeff Daniels was too old to play an itinerant, aspiring actor. I didn't check to see how old Richard Dreyfuss and Marsha Mason were in the original film, but, didn't they look fresher and more energetic than these actors? They had great chemistry, too. Daniels and Heaton do not. You have to believe to watch a romance. Hallie Eisenberg was okay as the daughter, but, again, this performance could never match Quinn Cummings, so, why repeat it? I wondered if it was distracting to people to see 'the soda pop girl' in the part. What is wrong with casting an unknown to give it more reality? Maybe younger unknowns or almost unknowns as the leads would have made a better movie. Oh, yeah, it did...the first time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hello, Goodbye Girl</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a die-hard fan of Neil Simon. I've read/seen all of his plays (I think) and know his style and rhythms the way a drummer might know "Ina-Gadda-Da-Vida" (there's no way in hell I spelled that right, but after all, I'm a writer not a drummer). I have recently been severely disappointed by Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn in "The Out-Of-Towners" and didn't exactly have what you might call "high hopes" for the made-for-cable version of one of Neil's most touching screenplays. But, turning it on one Saturday evening, I was met with a pleasant surprise.The script is largely unchanged (save for one or two "modernizations") from the original version and, though this dates it just a little, it retains its charm in this way. Jeff Daniels and Patricia Heaton (who, when I heard they were cast in this thing, I went "Wunhh?") are charming and their chemistry is, let's say, surprising. The strength is really Heaton, and at times Daniels seems a little out of his element, but both handle the Neil Simon patter admirably. And, I gotta say, he deserves praise for his performance in "Richard III." Not a lot of actors would've done that.Okay, complaints: Halley "The Pepsi girl" Eisenberg as the daughter is thoroughly and amazingly mediocre when compared to the original actress (I know I'm getting these names wrong, but you're ON the IMDB, look it up yourself!) and Alan Cumming, one of the funniest people out there right now, is underused as the unconventional director of "Richard."But, overall, it's worth a watch. If you have three hours to spare (that's about how long it plays with commercials) catch it on a rerun. Good though it is, for the true Simon-philes, like myself, stick to Dick Dreyfus.And, for the short attention spans out there: 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent television adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of the the 1977 Neil Simon, Herbert Ross film is effective. The performances are genuine and well done, generally, though not as well realized as those by Richard Dreyfuss and Marsha Mason in the original. While Jeff Daniels' more subdued and slightly more attractive Elliott Garfield is appealing, Dreyfuss' over the top, oscar winning performamce is still superior in many ways. Patricia Heaton is warm, lovely, and appropriate as Paula, but never truly outstanding. Again, a more attractive actress than Mason, but she plays at it with somewhat more vulnurability and less strength than Mason.This production robs the material of a bit of its original realism; the massive New York apartment, with its clean, modern appliances and wide open spaces takes away the charm and immediacy of the tiny two bedroom in the original film. The scene where they repaint and redo the living room does damage, where in the original film the scene was poignant for its improvement on the dusty living space they shared.Pepsi-faced Halli Kate Eisenberg is the most wonderful surprise in the film. She approaches the material with more warmth and understanding than the rather spoiled brat take we got from the child actress in the first film. She is bright, approachable, even when she's angry she's vulnurable and believeable.All around, this film gave me the warm fuzzies. It's well written, well performed, MOSTLY appropriately updated including its pop cultural references. Interesting cameo by director Benjamin as a, well, a director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who doesn't dread a TV movie? But then again, how many TV movies are advertised on billboards on the side of the highway? I read the reviews before I watched this movie, and they weren't kind. I thought it was charming. Patricia Heaton slips comfortably out of the `Raymond' housewife role into the convincing life of a washed-up Broadway dancer. She's incredibly sympathetic as a conflicted woman who has never had a break in her life and seems to just be living in ever-repeating circles and never goes anywhere. Her only salvation is in her young daughter, who is oddly wise for her age. She (Heaton) wants to trust, but hates herself when she finally does. Then there's Jeff Daniels. He's always good. I wouldn't have thought he could pull off this role, but the gay Shakespeare bit and the neurotic outbursts are all well done. As far as TV movies go, this was right on the money. There were some things that were probably hangovers from the original that didn't quite fit in with the present day, such as the incense, nude guitar playing, and bicarbonate for stomach aches, but that just nit-picking. I don't like to over-analyze things just to sound smart, so I'll just say that if you can't make it to the theater, then sit back and enjoy this one at home. I give this movie a little 'handicap' score since it was on TV, and so I give it a 7. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>everything is a little off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paula McFadden (Patricia Heaton) is 36 and a little too old to be a dancer. She is left behind by her married actor boyfriend Tony DeForrest for a job in Italy. She doesn't have any money staying in the apartment with her daughter Lucy (Hallie Kate Eisenberg). It turns out that Tony sublet his apartment to Elliot Garfield (Jeff Daniels) out from under her. She refuses to leave and Elliot reluctantly agrees to let her stay.Patricia Heaton is wrong for this role. She can't pull off even a former dancer. Also I don't think that she's quite right to be Eisenberg's mom. She's much better in a soccer mom role. Daniels is charming. Eisenberg is great as the talkative little girl. The Neil Simon play is still good but everything is a little bit off. The '77 movie is perfectly fine. This feels like a faded copy. The apartment doesn't have quite the NYC feel. I do like Eisenberg with Daniels and their scene together is great. Basically the movie feels wrong but it still has the essence of a good story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 2004 remake of the 1977 version of the goodbye girl was in the least to say awful. Beside from the fact that the actors did not fit the roles very well, everything else was exactly the same. The camera angles along with the words spoken by the characters. It was like the people who decided to redo the movie didn't have enough brains to spice it up a little bit. The character of Paula got annoying as she cried through practically the whole movie. There were some funny moments in the movie and the fact that Jeff Daniels spoke much slower and clearly than Richard Dreyfus. The movie was in the least to say not very good and I would not recommend it to serious movie fans. I give this movie two out of five stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why was it made ? GREED</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many of the previous posts have asked why this movie was made. I can only think of one reason. Greed, pure and simple. Neil Simon hasn't exactly had any recent hits and no doubt he got a bundle for the right to use this again. Warner had made the original and as owners of TNT no doubt had little cost in a remake. The original was a smash hit, insuring a massive look-in audience.The result is a shambles.Pale, thin, imitation "Goodbye Girl" that should never have seen the light of day (or cathode ray tube).The performances of Daniels and Heaton are dreadful, or perhaps "capital P , capital U, capital TRID" says it best. Heaton actually give a better performance in her grocery store ads.There is no emotion, no passion, no energy.There are many reasons to remake an movie, usually because of limitations imposed on the original due to budget or production methods. There were no such limitations imposed on the originaland therefore no reason for a remake, especially a remake that is essentially 99 pct original dialog.The classic play "The Front Page" has been remade many times. Love or hate the versions they at least had something new. In "His Girl Friday" they switched genders. In the Jack Lemmon - Walter Matthau version they had a great comedy duo. In "Switching Channels" is was updated to a TV newsroom. I have no objection to a revival, plays were meant to be performed. Imagine if it was decided that the best performance of a work of Shakespeare was in the 1800s and therefore the play would never be performed again. When you have a classic version of a film, which can be enjoyed by subsequent generations, a remake is unnecessary.Let's face it, Richard Dreyfuss won an Oscar for his performance in the original for a very good reason. Marsha Mason, Quinn Cummings, Ray Stark (Producer - Best Picture) and Neil Simon were all nominated for Oscars.Richard Benjamin, brings nothing new to the table in this production, either as director or in his unnecessarily expanded part as Oliver Frey (Nicol Williamson wasn't even credited for his part in the original). In summary, as others have said before, rent the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never understood the need for remakes period. But when you remake a movie isn't the idea to try to improve upon it? What's the point of remaking a movie when you virtually do it word for word as is the case with "The Goodbye Girl"? The original is a wonderful comedy/romance with terrific performances by all three leads. But watching this remake serves only to remind you how good the original is and how little is being brought to this film.Jeff Daniels and Patricia Heaton are good actors misplaced here. Daniels is totally wrong here. He has none of the charming cockiness that Richard Dreyfuss had. Heaton is far too abrasive and too attractive for the part. Every time we see her in a low cut nightgown we wonder why Daniels doesn't throw caution to the wind and go for it earlier. And Hallie Eisenberg is just terrible as the daughter. Quinn Cummings was so great in the original that maybe no one could top it.The story is exactly the same. Even the odd subplot with our hero doing an off Broadway show as a gay Richard III, which was dumb and out of place in the original, is even worse here. Director Richard Benjamin does what he can (including giving himself a cameo where he is surprisingly wooden) but the miscasting takes away what charm there is in the script.Finally, why remake a good movie? Remake a bad one and make it better. Stay away from the good ones. These remakes can only tarnish the memory of the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the other one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As great a playwright as he is, Neil Simon occasionally goes a bit "overboard." In the movie "Plaza Suite," there wasn't one single likable character among all three stories, and the same was true of the original "The Out-of-Towners" - despite leads you wouldn't think capable of projecting this. And if it were ever possible to become tired of the great Walter Matthau's presence on screen, "Plaza Suite" confirmed it. In the original of this story, Marsha Mason was, in my opinion, thoroughly annoying - and I never cared for her work in anything of hers I ever saw. Patricia Heaton is 180-degrees opposite, and this movie proves it. Her Paula was someone you'd want to be with, stay with, come home to. Marsha Mason was one which you could visualize anybody chomping at the proverbial "bit" to extricate oneself. Further, Jeff Daniels is far more likable than Richard Dryfess as Elliot. Patricia Heaton rates along with Diane Keaton, Ann Heche, Sharon Stone and Sandra Bullock - as someone whom you thoroughly enjoy watching, whether the character is comedic, serious, tragic, or whatever. This movie's a "9," its predecessor about a "5-1/2."</fullReview>
