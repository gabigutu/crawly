		<shortDescription>I LOVE this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best romantic comedies ever. Dreyfuss &amp; Mason generate as much chemistry as I have ever seen on the screen from a couple that was never a couple. Quinn Cummings delivers one of the greatest child actress performance in cinema history -- always genuine and winning. The dialogue is witty and brittle. The direction never strikes a false note. And all the dualities of New York are well exploited. I simply LOVE this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally unbelievable--but LOTS of fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paula McFadden (Marsha Mason) and her 10 year old daughter Lucy (Quinn Cummings) are abandoned in NYC by her married boyfriend. He also sublets the apartment they share to a young actor, Eliot Garfield (Richard Dreyfuss). They agree to live together even though they hate each other. Naturally, they fall in love.Totally predictable but I really enjoyed it! I loved in back in 1977 and I still love it now! Neil Simon's script is basically just a series of one liners--but they ARE funny and Dreyfuss, Mason and Cummings deliver them perfectly. They come fast and furious and the movie moves very quickly--it doesn't seem like it's 110 minutes long. Dreyfuss deservedly won the Best Actor Award for this film--he's 'on' non-stop and is full of energy and fun.Mason was nominated for Best Actress and she's almost as good as Dreyfuss (she was a little too whiny for me). Cummings isn't that good--but she WAS only 10 when she did this. It's just that her character is one of those screen kids that talks and acts like an adult--I didn't think having her swear occasionally was cute or funny. Nonetheless she was nominated for Best Supporting Actress. The movie was also up for Best Original Screenplay and Best Picture. Also there's a GREAT title song written and performed by David Gates over the closing credits (it was also a big hit song back in '77). Also Nicol Williamson pops up (unbilled) in a short but VERY funny cameo.The only debit--the romance scenes were corny (but they do work) and some of the dramatic scenes were TERRIBLY written (Simon was always better at doing comedy). And he has two thunderstorms pop up out of NOWHERE in this movie during a big romantic and dramatic scene. That was pushing it a little too much! Still the acting carries those scenes through and it's a minor complaint.A sweet, very funny, enjoyable film. Just don't think about it TOO much. I give it a 9.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another successful Simon "Odd Couple" story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Neil Simon is consistent. He loves to use and reuse the "ODD COUPLE" plot with variations in one play or another: in the original ODD COUPLE, it's female version (shown in the early 1990s), the sequel film with Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon, the play (and movie) THE SUNSHINE BOYS - where the apartment is a lifelong comedy team partnership, and this one. Here it is Marcia Mason and her daughter, Quinn Cummings, who are always being deserted by Mason's husband or her series of boy-friends who usually are actors. Mason has become determined never again to trust or date an actor. But the apartment happens to be in the name of her last boyfriend, and he has made a subletting deal with out-of-town actor Richard Dreyfus. Dreyfus is determined to stay in the apartment while in New York (he is starring in a production within the city - off Broadway). He and Mason gradually agree to cease their hostilities and to share the apartment, but Mason finds Dreyfus weird: he is only eating special food, and he chants and plays the guitar at night. On the other hand Quinn Cummings finds he's not such a bad guy (he helps her when she has a headache, relaxing her to sleep). The play that Dreyfus is appearing in the lead role in is Shakespeare's RICHARD III. It is being produced by Paul Benedict (a rare big part for that good comic actor), but his ideas about the production are upsetting Dreyfus. Dreyfus is approaching the role in the classical, "Olivier" form - the master, evil Machiavellian monarch. Machiavellian to be sure in Benedict's version, but also gay. As Benedict pushes it, it is the story of "the Queen who would be King". Dreyfus's performance of the play within the film, following Benedict's direction, is an everlasting comic joy.The highs and lows of the two warring suite mates follows a romantic course, as they gradually fall in love with each other. Will this actor prove to be another one of those typically selfish actors that Mason resents, or will he prove to be different to her and Cummings - will he be the real love of her life?A first rate comedy, and Dreyfus' Oscar - a well earned one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gives you a warm glow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply my favourite movie of all time. First saw it with my fiancee (at the time) and it was her favourite also. We saw it 3 times. Whenever it is on TV I watch, and I have two video copies (in case one gets lost or spoiled!).It stars Richard Dreyfuss at his best, and Marsha Mason and the "kid" are excellent too. Perhaps it is one of the best of films because it is able to make you laugh and cry, and sometimes at the same time. Neil Simon's writing is so comic and never allows the pathos to drown you. I believe it won a number of Oscars when first released yet almost no one I rave to about it has ever heard of it. Strange!This film is very much under-appreciated. It is a wonderful tale of of family, of career, of relationships and of love. The rooftop scene is just fantastic and leaves a knot in my stomach every time I see it. A warm glow and a feeling of "this is how life should turn out". Great movie, great script. Fantastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect a romantic comedy. Warm hearted, funny and well, just perfect!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two decades have passed since I first viewed "The Goodbye Girl". I can think of few films that hold up like this Neil Simon comedy. I read in a previous review that the plot is "unbelievable". Am I wrong in recalling that the writer admitted that he got the concept complete from the life of an actor? Just another case of reality possessing more truth than fiction. Richard Dreyfus and Marsha Mason should be added to that rare list of actors whose performances will forever define the characters they portrayed. Elliot Garfield and Paula McFadden belong to them in perpetuity. Played by Quinn Cummings, Lucy McFadden simply made the film work as a sophisticated child who never uttered one cloying word. Bless you Quinn, wherever your are. For someone who has been a friend of actors, and who has adored dancers, every situation in the film rang true. Previous reviews havecovered all the cinematic aspects, so I will just add my accolade: This is a film that rates with the best of Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If they think they can compete with the likes of The Goodbye Girl. It's definitely the best of it's genre, and I don't know why more people haven't seen it. The acting is superb, the jokes are (mostly) hilarious, however many times you see the film, and I have so many favourite scenes I could probably tell you the whole movie.Richard Dreyfuss is excellent as Elliott, the wet stranger that arrives at Paula's apartment, and Quinn Cummings (Lucy) is a perfect example of a 10 year old girl. For once, it's a film that isn't totally predictable and doesn't end with a kiss!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A special edition DVD would be a blast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The greatest romantic comedy of all time, and you cannot even get a "Vanilla" DVD in the uk. This is a movie with a strange history. Originally started in 1976 by Mike Nichols, it was called "Bogart slept here" and starred Marsha Mason and Robert DeNiro.The great thespian is rumoured to of walked out of rehearsals after Mason said that he should respect Mike Nichols more. (Nichols had worked out that DeNiro could not "Do Joy".) No such problems for Dreyfuss. He is amazing as Elliot Garfield. The two leads capture each line to perfection, which is no mean feat as nearly every line in this movie is a gag. Even Quinn Cummings is that rare thing a child actor that does not make you reach for a revolver. Even the now dated Gay King Richard routine works still as it is done in such a sweet, good natured way. So many great lines (my personal favourite..... "Capital P, Capital U, capital TRID") The final shots of Mason are an echo of the final shots of (the vastly overrated) "Breakfast at Tiffanys". Also this is one of those rare Romances that men enjoy, possibly because Dreyfuss is not exactly George Clooney, is an incredible smart arse throughout. and unlike someone like Hugh Grant actually knows when to put the "moves" on (so to speak) Hope for all average looking guys everywhere. A Brilliant, Brilliant movie. Please can we have a DVD release with whistle and bells please Rastar and Sony.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poor Marsha Marson. All of her relationships end in failure. The guy simply walks out. She has a precocious daughter, devilishly played by Quinn Cummings. The latter received a supporting actress nomination and faded from the movie scene real fast. Where are you Quinn darling?Forced to share an apartment with a stranger, Mason may finally be on the right track. Richard Dreyfuss is that man and in a surprise Oscar winning performance (Richard Burton was also up for Equus that year), he is perfect in the role as the charmer.By movie's end Dreyfuss has to go off to somewhere but unlike the other men in her life, will return. How do we know he is coming back? Just see this delightful film and find out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Such a predictable plot. Very strange boy with heart of gold meets bitter neurotic girl with cutesy 10 year old adult daughter. It's hate at first sight, followed by love, followed by hate, followed by love. The end.Such annoying characters. Marsha Mason's single mom is so unpleasant and unstable that it's hard to imagine any man wanting to have a romantic relationship with her. Dreyfuss's character is written to make him a real weirdo, though as the movie progresses all the weird character traits disappear. (For example, he's portrayed early on as a health freak and very particular about what he eats; later, he's eating spaghetti and drinking cheap wine, and I think pizza appears in a later scene.) The 10 year old daughter/adult spouting Neil Simon one-liners is painful.Only saving grace -- the "B" plot with an unwilling Dreyfuss forced to play Richard III as a flaming gay at the direction of crazed director Paul Benedict. Watching Dreyfuss mince and lisp his way through some of the great scenes in Richard III is enough to give this dreadful movie a 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where Did The Time Go?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is starting to feel like another planet when you think about the time that has passed since Neil Simon was cranking out comedies like this one in the 1970's. What makes it feel longer is - Marsha Mason is 70 years old this year 2012 Richard Dreyfuss is 65 years old this year.Their daughter who was a newcomer in this movie is 40 years old this year.Dreyfuss won an Oscar for this one and deservedly so. His character is extremely energetic and in a time before it is fashionable has to play a gay King Richard.As for Mason, she is delicious and bitchy all in moments.Neil Simon is 85 this year and his last writing credit was in 2007. In the 1970's Simon was doing scripts like this, The Odd Couple and The Sun Shine Boys.While the Goodbye Girl is not quite as well done as the others, this is still a pretty solid script for it's era. What seems strange is that this one just was shown on The Essentials on TCM. I am not used to having a movie that came out when I grew up being honored in that Saturday night slot. Still, it deserved the recognition.We need films like this one to remind us people and movies are not perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They can fight; we'll give them that. And for some couples that might be a bad thing but for these two we think it bodes well.This was a super-retro for us. We know there are plenty of older movies out there but we hadn't seen this one in a really long time and had forgotten how good it is.Paula McFadden has been living in NY with her actor boyfriend Tony and her young daughter Lucy. The three are planning to head to LA where Tony has a movie role lined up. But after finishing up some last minute shopping Paula returns home to discover that Tony has cleared out without her and headed to Italy instead. To make matters worse she also learns that he has sub-let their apartment to Elliot Garfield, another actor who arrives that night soaked to the skin and with all of his belongings.Despite her best attempts to keep him out, she has no choice but to let him in and the two agree to a cautious sharing of the apartment. Unsurprisingly this creates friction between them. Paula is already over-wrought, over-protective, and over-emotional, and she is clearly afraid to trust anyone. Elliot is funny and quirky, but comes with a bag full of annoying habits including late night meditating complete with full volume "OMs." We found his desire to irritate Paula quite understandable but his lack of consideration towards her sleeping daughter pretty uncharitable.While the close proximity gives these two ample opportunity to rub each other the wrong way it allows them to see the good qualities in each other as well. Paula can be sweet and sensitive, and she has an open honest relationship with her daughter. She is perhaps too willing to let her feeling show (nobody loves an open wound), but we appreciate her honesty. Elliot is funny, charming and generous - we love the rooftop dinner and the horse-and-buggy after school pickup. And he clearly loves Lucy.The two have great intercourse and not just between the sheets. They fight, they quarrel; they laugh, spar, debate and vent. They exchange and converse. In a word - they communicate, and well. Paula's neuroses may get in the way from time to time, but Elliot doesn't seem to mind soothing them out. We think it will be a long time before these two say goodbye.http://www.reel-couples.com/paula-mcfadden-elliot-garfield/Reel Thing Rating: 4 out of 5 Reels</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never been one for "chick flicks", or even comedies as a rule, but this is one of my all time favorite movies. It is easy to see why it was nominated, and won so many awards. Marsha Mason does an excellent job (I absolutely love her in this role), as do Richard Dreyfus and Quinn Cummings. They play off one another well, and the delivery of the one liners is perfect. Even though the plot is predictable, it is well directed, the story is fast paced, and the acting is incredible. I just finished watching it again for the umpteenth time and came away with the same warm feeling I had the first time I saw it back in the late seventies. If you are the type of movie goer that enjoys watching the actors for the art of acting, as well as for enjoyment, give this movie a chance. I think you will be happily surprised at how much you will enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hysterical and romantic....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Herbert Ross and written by the fantastic Neill Simon this is another comedy classic sticking closely to the winning Odd Couple formula.It's not just a comedy though it's also a touching romance a former chorus dancer and single mum Paula McFadden(Marsha Mason)has just broken up with another boyfriend and is living in an apartment with her young daughter Lucy(Quinn Cummings).One night during a massive rainstorm a close friend of her former boyfriend called Elliot Garfield(Richard Dreyfuss)turns up he's been told he can stay at the apartment.After much arguing and shouting Paula eventually lets him stay and they divide the apartment up into their own areas.Not too similar to The Odd Couple but this ones again about two opposites being forced to live together through unforeseen circumstances and opposites attracting.Richard is just hysterical as the struggling actor who's got the part of Richard the third in a daring new production playing Richard.....as a gay man.His rehearsal scenes are so funny and it's a delight to watch him and Paula develop a friendship and later a relationship.Well worth watching for the performances of the leads and hysterical dialogue courtesy of Paul Simon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was amazing! If you're looking for a great love story, here it is! I loved it so much and "Goodbye Girl" the song is awesome! I love this movie and I can relate to the Charatcer of Ellot Garfield the most, a hard working actor who keeps getting dumped on. This movie is very humorous but has the element of love and compassion that I never saw from Richard Dryfus before, he was actually very sexy in this movie, believe it or not. I LOVE "THE GOODBYE GIRL"! This story originated on Broadway as a musical, but became a movie in 1977. If you love dancers and actors who fall in love, this is the movie for you! It really tugs at your heartstrings and leaves you with that warm fuzzy feeling in the pit of your tummy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When it comes to love, never say never. Better yet, never say good-bye...Paula McFadden (Marsha Mason) is an over the hill dancer sharing an apartment with her daughter, Lucy (Quinn Cummings), and her boyfriend, a married director. She and Lucy are all set to follow her boyfriend to the set of his next movie when they come home one afternoon to find that he is gone, and the only thing he has left is a good-bye note. As unpleasant a surprise as this is, it's not the first time it's happened to Paula. So now she has to find a job to support herself and her daughter. Just when it looks like things couldn't get worse, Elliott Garfield (Richard Dreyfuss) arrives, claiming that he is supposed to sublet the apartment while in town to do Richard III. This is not what Paula wants to hear, and the two of them get off on the wrong foot, but as Elliott has no other place to go, Paula agrees to let him stay in the apartment. As time goes by, Paula's troubles finding work continue, and Elliott discovers that his director wishes to portray Richard as "the queen who would be king." Mutual sympathy and respect develop, which eventually turns to love. Will they find happiness together, or will a film opportunity for Elliot cause a repeat of the pattern that Paula knows all too well? The script is absolutely charming, as is typical of Neil Simon. The original battles between Paula and Elliott sparkle with wit, and their love scenes brim with tenderness brought on by their hard won affection for each other. Paula's growth is so subtly depicted that you don't realize it until she points it out. Elliott's reliability is built solidly throughout the picture. Their ultimate devotion to each other is immensely satisfying.The acting is also first rate. Mason delivers her usual stunning performance, going from hurt paranoia to believing love in a lovely arc. Dreyfuss is equally good in revealing that under the bravado lies a basically good man who only wants to do the right thing for his woman. Quinn Cummings offers a scene stealing performance as a child wise beyond her years, who nevertheless has a child's vulnerability.One of the ultimate feel good movies, it will have you cheering for love at the end.</fullReview>

With Richard Dreyfuss (who won an Oscar for this role), Marsha Mason and Quinn Cummings as Paula's fabulous young daughter they make this a pleasure to watch. The one liners in this will split your sides as Simon's is on top form. I have seen this movie an obscene amount of times we are talking double figures! It still brings me to the edge of my seat when Paula (Marsha Mason) gets that call from Elliot (Richard Dreyfuss) asking her to go with him and her wonderfully joyful and tear jerking (well that might just be me) reply.

Together with Marsha Mason,who is perfect in her role as a divorced woman soured on romance and more concerned with rebuilding her life and raising her daughter, Dreyfuss puts together a blend of wit,charm and sarcastic "one liners" as an out of workactor trying his hardest to "make it " in New York while sharingan apartment with Mason on a "strictly business" arrangement. Neil Simon's script is not only outrageously funny but at times compelling and few in Hollywood can shed tears as only Ms. Mason can.

		<fullReview>It was great viewing this great comedy about a divorced dancer, Paula McFadden, (Marsha Mason) who lives in New York with her young daughter, Lucy MacFadden, (Quinn Cummings) and they are both trying to get over the divorce which greatly upset the family. Paula's ex-husband moved to California and at the same time he leased out Paula's apartment to a new tenant. It just so happens that Elliot Garfield, (Richard Dreyfuss) is an actor who has paid $600.00 to lease this apartment and this is when Paula and Elliot get into a major problem with trying to get along with him living with her and the daughter. This is a very cute and romantic story which is a great comedy by a great director, Neil Simon who was in real life married at the time to Marsha Mason. Richard Dreyfuss won an Academy Award for this film and also starred in the famous film "Jaws". Enjoy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Winning Romantic Comedy from Neil Simon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1977 was apparently the year for neurotic romantic comedies featuring people who look like real people, if "The Goodbye Girl" and "Annie Hall" are anything to go by. Woody Allen's film is obviously the superior of the two, but I have a soft spot for Neil Simon's comedy, and I like it quite a lot.Richard Dreyfuss was on the cusp of stardom after his performance in "Jaws," and his double score this year with "The Goodbye Girl" and "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" launched him into the big time. Marsha Mason was perfect at playing roles like this -- vulnerable softies looking for love while at the same time tough cookies who could make it on their own if forced to. In this film, the two meet cute when Dreyfuss shows up at Mason's apartment, having subletted it from Mason's boyfriend, who dumped her and took off without telling her that she and her ten-year-old daughter would be left with no place to live. Dreyfuss, a struggling actor, agrees to let the mom and daughter stay in the apartment with him, and of course after much bickering, the two fall in love. The movie is at its best when Dreyfuss and Mason are fighting. My favorite line is delivered by Mason after one of their many run-ins over Dreyfuss's bohemian living habits: "I don't know you well enough to truly dislike you, but you are just too weird to live with." Quinn Cummings gives an adorable performance as Mason's daughter. She manages to be both precocious and cute (think Tatum O'Neal in "Paper Moon"), a tough feat for a child actor. In one of the first scenes, while Mason is reading the dear john letter left by her louse of a boyfriend, who's left to star in a Bertolucci film, Cummings, instead of asking questions about what happened between her mom and boyfriend, or what they're going to do, or any other number of things it would make sense for a child to ask about, wants to know instead who Bertolucci is and what movies he's directed. A kid after my own heart.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's OK, but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is sometimes amusing and contains some good acting by Richard Dreyfuss and Quinn Cummings, but it's also very annoying. Dreyfuss is good at doing this type of character but he also seems rather manic; he, Dreyfuss, is in fact bi-polar, which may account in part for this. Dreyfuss also had a rather serious problem with cocaine, and that too may in part account for his frenetic performance. Marsha Mason is totally irritating; no wonder all the men she gets involved with leave her! This movie derives part of its charm from the fact that the two romantic leads are not particularly young, attractive or likable, which is unusual for a romantic comedy. But that makes it harder for the view to feel sympathetic for the two; I quite frankly didn't give a hoot whether or not they got together or stayed together. And although the ending implies that Eliot is so smitten with Paula that he will never leave her, I tend to think that eventually he will get tired of this needy, immature woman. That little speech she gives him towards the end about how she's "grown up" doesn't ring one bit true, especially in light of what she does a little later, that is, standing out on the fire escape in the pouring rain in a sheer nightgown clutching his guitar and screaming "I LOVE YOU"! That kind of behavior you would expect from a lovesick teenager not a 33 year old woman who's "grown up". Overall I would say that this a rather silly diversion of a movie. And Dreyfuss did NOT deserve an Oscar for this. Richard Burton should have won that year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Example of How All the Greatest Films Were Saved For the 1960s and 1970s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Goodbye Girl has a flawless diamond of a script, a quintessential example of how truly effective writing can be if the writer really puts his heart and soul into the work, and taxes his brain on every word. The dialogue is extremely witty, the story is rocking with realism, the characterizations are boldly clear, and it is all played fairly and humanistically for laughs. Neil Simon makes us laugh hysterically at his reflection of a hapless stage in any two people's lives. Even when it comes right down to the smaller elements of the film that would later become aggravating clichés, like the wisecracking young daughter with a mouth much older than she is, every note is hit right.Richard Dreyfuss brings a wonderful, passionate energy to his Oscar-winning performance, fleshing out his character rivetingly. Here is where Dreyfuss truly brandishes his talent as an actor. His performance is seamless to the point where during the first scene wherein he's being forced by his theater director to play Henry V as a flaming effeminate homosexual, there is the subtlest girly shifting of his feet that can be hardly noticed, but Dreyfuss knows that this sort of thing matters to an effective performance.Marsha Mason matches him perfectly. Her role is so painfully real and her portrayal is so painfully honest. Her sensitivity and affection to her character, the harshly sympathetic archetype of a struggling middle-aged everywoman, brings you so much closer to her. She is so lovingly, hilariously, wittily, and beautifully true.This film is one of the finest examples I've recently seen of how all the greatest screenplays and performances were hoarded for two particular and highly potent decades, the 1960s and '70s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time. I recently came across "The Goodbye Girl" on cable (On-Demand) and noticed all the awards it won. I was around in 1977 but was a younger teenager... still, you'd think I would have seen this film by now. The acting was incredible, enormous energy invested by all concerned... script was awesome. I'm not usually that big on love stories, but this one was so entertaining and simultaneously touching that I found myself looking up after two hours, feeling like five minutes had just gone by. An easy classic, 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In many aspects a rather ordinarily made film, it is nevertheless revived by quality acting, a few funny moments and some rather witty lines. That is not to say that it is a very well written film, as the story is drone, lame and predictable. Richard Dreyfuss, who won the Oscar for his very charismatic performance is great though, and Quinn Cummings as the daughter has some fine moments too. Marsha Mason's acting lacks in charm, but the other two main performances compensate. There is a bit of insight into the acting business too, but this is not too great a film overall. However, it is certainly well acted and witty at times, bringing it well above par.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>She'd scare any sane man away...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oscar-winner Richard Dreyfuss exudes lots of kooky, ego-fed charisma and has energy to spare in "The Goodbye Girl" but there's nothing here to keep his character together with Marsha Mason's--except a few plot contrivances. Mason plays a single mom trying to find work as a dancer on Broadway, Dreyfuss is a burgeoning stage actor who has been promised her apartment. They pick at each other until one night he kisses her and that seems to change nearly everything between them. Once their romance begins, almost every scene thereafter is a bummer. Mason harps on redoing her apartment ("Go be a movie star," she tells Dreyfuss, "I'll be here hanging up my wallpaper."). What is her irrational need to find a man and set up house? It's more important to her than finding work. Mason looks smashing in a pixie cut that accentuates her big gummy smile, but her character's insecure, moody behavior is enough to drive any reasonably sane man away. Thank goodness for daughter Quinn Cummings' smart mouth, Dreyfuss may never return. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When former dancer Paula McFadden comes home from a shopping spree with her ten year old daughter Lucy, she finds a Dear Jane letter from her boyfriend Tony. They both had been looking forward to accompanying Tony to California while he films a movie. It seems he's taken a film role in Italy instead and left her high and dry. This is the beginning of her problems. Later that night, she and Lucy are awakened by someone at the door. She opens it to see a soaking wet Elliot Garfield, starving actor. He claims he has sublet the apartment from Tony for three months for $600 and wants to move in that night since he has no place to stay. After telling him to take it up with her fictional police sergeant husband, Paula slams the door in his face and goes back to bed. He calls her a few minutes later from the phone booth down on the corner and tells her he knows she's lying. He convinces her to let him come up and talk over the situation. Paula agrees to let him stay, reasoning that he has a key to the place and she would have to stand guard to keep him from coming in. She begins listing rules for living in the apartment and he responds that he's paying the rent and he will make the rules. Thus begins an unlikely and amusing love story. If you're looking for nude love scenes and bawdy humor, look elsewhere. This is a sweet, funny and smart romantic comedy about two people making the best of a difficult situation and learning to trust again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Romantic Comedy Written by a Comic Genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a precious few writers in Hollywood who have gained name recognition among audience members. Those who have entered the upper echelons of critical and popular recognition include such names as Woody Allen, Quentin Tarantino and Aaron Sorkin. Yet hidden among this elite group is the consistently under-appreciated Neil Simon; a playwright turned occasional screenwriter who along with Mel Brooks and the Zucker/Abrahams team modernized the way we see comedy on the screen. In fairness to those who don't know his name, he was much more of a playwright in the Noel Coward, George Bernard Shaw stripe. My first experience with Simon was reading Lost in Yonkers in grade school, and I immediately fell in love with his sophisticated yet workman-like brand of comedy.The Goodbye Girl starts with Paula (Mason) and Lucy (Cummings) a mother and daughter pair living in a quaint New York City apartment. Paula has been seeing a married actor who jilts her to go to Italy to shoot a movie. Unable to pay rent and struggling with a re- ignited dancing career, Paula's troubles are compounded with the arrival of an unwelcome house guest (Dreyfuss). Elliot happens to be a struggling actor as well and happened to have subleased the apartment out from under her nose. Having the choice between moving out or dealing with the neurotic but kindhearted actor, Paula and Lucy choose to stay. Thus begins an uncommon living arrangement that turns into a budding romance.For every grounded hardship the characters face, Simon is quick to add a one-liner to break the tension and further endear the audience to the characters. The dialogue is so sharp and bursting at the seems with goofy, quick-witted, verbal sparring that it's easy to assume the movie was adapted from a play. Yet the movie is an original. Simon did not adapt one of his plays as he so often does but instead tried to adapt a movie partially based on the overnight success of Dustin Hoffman (starring Robert De Niro). The original script was much darker than Simon would have liked so he tinkered until he came up with The Goodbye Girl's adept mix of humor, romance and pathos.The movie has the added bonus of having three very good central actors who take full advantage of the dialogue. Dreyfuss is truly charming as the scruffy, wayward Elliot struggling to make a splash in New York's stage scene. His natural amiability and occasionally goofy demeanor brings the perfect balance and achieves a high level of energy that Mason and Cummings reach and exceed with aplomb. Mason likewise is a vision as Paula, approaching a similar balance between forlorn neuroticism and strength. The real show-stealer however is Cummings as the young Lucy. At times the dialogue makes her a bit too precocious for her own good yet between two very strong veteran actors at the top of their game, her standing out seems like a miracle. It's important to note that all three actors received an Academy Award nomination for their portrayals, Dreyfuss becoming the youngest winner at the time.If there is one sticking point to be expanded on it's the ending which leaves the relationship between Elliot and Paula a little strained yet hurriedly resolved. Perhaps Simon ran out of material or perhaps I found the characters so relatable I simply wanted to see more. Both adults have managed to survive and even thrive in 1970's New York despite the odds being completely against them; I for one would have loved the 15 minute denouement to be more of a victory lap. I suppose Neil Simon was reminded of the old showman saying "always leave the audience wanting more."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun Dreyfuss Character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After being dumped by her live-in boyfriend, an unemployed dancer (Marsha Mason) and her 10-year-old daughter are reluctantly forced to live with a struggling off-Broadway actor (Richard Dreyfuss).This is Richard Dreyfuss at perhaps his most offbeat. Sure, Marsha Mason plays the lead and the film is called "the goodbye girl", but I think the movie passes or fails with Dreyfuss. For me, it passes, as he is strangely interesting and fun to watch.The film as a whole is not that amazing. It seems to have secured a few Oscar nominations but few wins. Today (2016), it is not one that most people have heard of. Heck, even Mason is not a household name. Worth a look, but not essential.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Neil Simon's romantic comedy helmed by Herbert Ross, stars his wife of that time, Marsha Mason, who would continue to lead three more pictures based on Simon's script, and among those four pictures, Mason acquires three Oscar nominations out of them (including this one, CHAPTER TWO 1979 and ONLY WHEN I LAUGH 1981), but more significant is that it won BEST LEADING ACTOR for Richard Dreyfuss, once the youngest winner at the age of 30 until Adrien Brody would unseat him in THE PIANIST (2002, 9/10). Paula McFadden (Mason) is a former dancer, she and her ten-year-old daughter Lucy (Cummings) are living with his actor boyfriend, one day, she returns to her apartment and out of the blue, finds out that she is dumped through a letter, her boyfriend deserts them because he has nailed a film contract, and what is worse, before leaving he sublets the apartment to one of his fellow actor Elliot Garfield (Dreyfuss), after an unpleasant first acquaintance, they merely agree to temporally live under the same roof. But Paula's world has been torn apart, being 32, she is obviously too old to compete in her old vocation, which is quite a grating prejudice of ageism, Elliot is a budding thespian, just being offer a chance play Richard III in an off-off-Broadway production, yet the requirement from the director of playing his role as "the queen who wants to be king", a stereotyped homosexual style boggles him.However, the from-foe-to-lover plot (which has become a corny norm in the genre now) of Paula and Elliot has been played out magnificently thanks to Simon's witty script with utterly delectable bickers, and the two leads shape a dynamic duo since Paula is juggling her insecure temperament of whether or not she should "trust the man" with her inherent attribute of a sucker for romance, whereas for Elliot, his feelings for her is prone to be a love-at-first-sight type, with a patina of verbal negation. Simon does prove that he has a keen eye to man-woman relationship, both sex carry an equal weight during the process and the equilibrium is maintained beautifully until the romance breaks out, not creative but essentially moving. Dreyfuss impresses with his top-notch elocution and genial spirit, leans on a more natural impulse other than rehearsed theatrics to be credible and engaging, also he looks rather older than his real-age, his Oscar victory would be very difficult to repeat now since Academy has shied away from awarding "good-natured" type of excellency decades ago, Elliot basically is a nice young man who has barely any bone to pick with, he is a bit finicky but never aggravates into the dark side. So does Mason, who possesses an obliging quality and her emotional turbulence is the main allure of the film, she is spontaneously approachable and compassion-arousing, which also functions as a magnet when the same scenario occurs to Elliot, we have no doubt what will happen, but it is Mason's heartfelt investment pulls off the feel-good ending and leaves us not grudge how lame it is. Also Quinn Cummings is nominated for an Oscar, the levelheaded but sensible daughter is always the catalyst between two adults, she is adorable and never a spoiled nuisance unlike nowadays her equivalents in the same breed. After all, THE GOODBYE GIRL is a much well-intentioned and well-executed comedy than another Ross-Simon production California SUITE (1978, 5/10), definitely a crowd- pleaser.</fullReview>

Her married actor boyfriend has moved to Spain/Italy for a movie instead of moving out to L.A. with them for a TV show. He sublets his apartment to another actor Elliot Garfield (Richard Dreyfuss). The girls are essentially kicked to the streets except Paula refuses to leave. A truce is declared with everybody trying to live together.This is a funny rom-com written by Neil Simon. The kid is adorable. Marsha Mason is the sarcastic bitter momma bear. There are some good exchanges with Dreyfuss who is terrific in this. The writing is sharp and funny. The chemistry does take awhile because Paula is so hostile for much of the movie. The lines come so fast that one can get overwhelmed.</fullReview>

Ms Cummins, well what does one say about her, the 10 year old kid was superbly acted, utterly likable. Kudos to the direction as well as the script. I recommend this to all who loves romance that is believable, it could actually happen to you ..... The one-liners from Elliot were great. No matter how many times you watch, they still sound new.

		<fullReview>I hate rom-coms. I really do. I hate their predictability. I hate the two dimensional characters. I hate how dated they usually are (I'm looking at you, "You Got Mail"). I just can't stand them. Every so often, though, a romantic comedy comes along that doesn't keep my eyes rolling for an hour and a half. One where the characters aren't cardboard cutouts of actual human beings. One that's actually able to pull at my heart strings and let out the inner romantic. The Goodbye Girl is one of those movies.The complaint I had with the film was the Lucy McFadden character played by Quinn Cummings. To be fair, I thought she showed a good range of emotions and as the movie progressed I actually started to like her. At the start of the movie, though, she was not a welcomed presence. Her over precociousness made her seem like a Tatum O'Neil wanna be. Lucy McFadden is kind of like taking a dip in a pool really early in the morning. At first, it feels harsh but it warms up to you as you stay a little while longer.The movie does have a lot of the clichés we've come to hate about rom-coms. It has the "strong woman" with the heart of ice. It has the quirky love interest that melts aforenamed heart of ice. It has the wildly unlikely circumstances leading up to the wildly unlikely romance and the big city backdrop, but somehow it just works. I don't know why or how, but it just does. I thought Richard Dreyfuss and Marsha Mason had great performances and I thought Elliot Garfield and Paula McFadden were likable characters. Is it my favorite movie of all time? No. Is it a bit of an Odd Couple rip off? Yes (though I guess that sort of thing works for Neil Simon). Did it give me that warm, fuzzy feeling rom-coms are supposed to give you (but so often fail to do)? Absolutely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A more civilized film, for a more civilized age...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't help but channel another favorite film of mine, "Star Wars" as I compare the outrageous but more comported and more intelligent film of yesteryear to today's offerings. A film made for adults, about adults, acting like adults, with adult problems, and solving them like adults might, and did before the market reshift of the 80s and 90s to a pure teenage audience (or audience with teenage taste)."The Goodbye Girl" is the kind of film I like to see and watch. It's a more comported film about people behaving like mature adults, without succumbing to the urge to be a child with raging hormones. But the theatre of the 70s was a different animal than today's teenage market model.Neil Simon's play, translated to the screen, is full of wit and verve. It is funny without condescending to body functions, nor explicit sex for the sake of shock (which has lost its shock altogether). We're seeing the courting of a couple, both of whom are fighting to hold onto their dreams and stay in the world they know and love without succumbing to defeat.Challenges are made and met, mostly from the couple that fight, vie and come to a state of détente and acceptance. Both Dreyfus and Mason are high energy and outrageous without being stupid and insulting (again, unlike so many of today's contemporary films). Watching this film I'm reminded of the adults that used to pervade society on all levels. I can also feel, see, sense and smell the set of the small apartment in New York; the art direction and lighting design are that good. Throw in some very competent actors, and you got yourself one great photplay waiting to be shown. I used to hate and bemoan the 70s, but this film reminded me that those years weren't so bad. If I had a critique of the film, it's Simon's writing style. It's full of more wit than I think most people can readily absorb. He's almost too funny at times. It's the kind of thing that's both his trademark and his bane. Referencing a non-sexual double entente and political ongoings of the era were zestful. It was an age when information was more filtered, though prevalent, yet delivered at a wiser pace to allow for mental digestion. But Simon bucks the trend of the time by delivering wit fast and furious. It was, and still is, considered great art and genius. Though at times it can be silly.An actor and a former hoofer with a daughter? Can it work? Well, you probably know the answer to that one, but it's the journey that's the actual joy. An old fashioned film for an old fashioned time, when technology, though present, didn't pigeon hole personality types into discreet demographics. In short, this film is made for most everyone.Ah, and I haven't given one of these in a while, there are a couple of marginally racy scenes. After all, it is a PG film, and I would urge the parent or would be parent who's interested in watching this with their children, to pre-screen it first, and then decide.Again, overall an inviting film with some funny, witty and tender scenes. It's also marginally cliché in a Neil Simon kind of way, but it's what you expect, and you love the man for it.A decent watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Goodbye Girl is a well-paced and bright romantic comedy from the 1970's which also reflects the lifestyle and social currents of that decade, sandwiched between 60's idealism and 80's materialism. This might sound glib but for me, it fits neatly in that period when young people were coping with disappointments and heartache as they tried to build lives for themselves.&nbsp;The script and the acting are funny, sad and entertaining throughout.The repartee between Marsha Mason and Richard Dreyfuss sparkles as the two people who are forced to accept each other as roommates, only because of economic necessity. One is a granola-eating guy from Chicago who meditates and exercises as he tries to make it in the New York theatre scene. The young woman is a single mother who has been abandoned by her common-law husband and tries to return to dancing. The music of Bread evokes the soft rock of the decade. We see Marsha Mason working as a sales girl for a Japanese car company in an era before Japanese cars were commonplace. Before gay rights became part of the social agenda, Richard Dreyfuss takes on the role of Richard II in a way that a 1970's audience felt was more like their home decorator or hairdresser. It all seems a bit dated and predictable; however, with the acting of Mason and Dreyfus and the brilliant script from Neil Simon, it still entertains and resonates with audiences. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To watch "The Goodbye Girl" is to watch a special slice of filmography. Never has Richard Dreyfuss commanded his role so effortlessly, relaxed yet so perfect in the part.(Everyone was a jobbing actor at some time.) He really does steal the show, which considering the fine performances by his two female co-stars, is quite a feat! A simple storyline, worked superbly through simple observational craft, weaves a "will they, won't they, should they, can they" masterclass in the art of entertainment. It is a rarity to find a film in which you care, indeed yearn, to follow the cast on their journey. The Genre will not be to everyone's taste(duh!)but the sheer talent shown in front of, and behind of, the Camera is quite delightful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Goodbye Girl' is A Wonderful Film, that is well-written, well-acted, well-directed &amp; even well-executed. It's one of the most involving movies from the late 1970's, as it gets almost everything right.Directed by Herbert Ross, 'The Goodbye Girl' centers on an odd trio-a struggling actor, who has sublet a Manhattan apartment from a friend, the current occupant "his friend's ex-girlfriend, who has just been abandoned" and her precocious young daughter.Neil Simon's Screenplay is top-notch. The film begins well and only keeps climbing the ladder. Also, the diversity between it's characters are very well-defined. The only problem I had with this film, was it's running-time. The film is about 10-15 minutes longer than it should have been. I feel if trimmed, it's overall impact would have only enhanced. Herbert Ross's direction is under-stated. Cinematography is perfect. Editing is alright.Performance-Wise: Richard Dreyfuss is lovable in an Oscar-Winning Performance. Marsha Mason is excellent in an Oscar-Nominated Performance. She delivers in each &amp; every sequence. Quinn Cummings is confidence personified, in an also Oscar-Nominated Performance. She stands on her own and matches up step to step, near senior performers like Dreyfuss &amp; Mason.On the whole, A Romantic Comedy-Drama, that manages to keep you hooked on the screen almost throughout. Worth A Watch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the new one made that had hootey and the blow fish song for it. I loved the song, but hated the remake of the movie. Not only were the wrong actors picked for the parts, but they weren't even believable in the parts. I love Jeff Daniels, but he stunk in this movie; it just totally was not made for him. I kept thinking of the way the original cast did the movie and it was so much better. I could watch that version over and over and never get tired of it. The new version was boring. The way Richard Dryfus acted in the movie was so believable and he had the right look for the part as well. I (the audience) thought his character was such an unlovable person at first and then he made us (the audience) fall in love with him right along with the mother and daughter characters. It would be nice to see this version with the hootey song.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film back in 1978, when I was just 11 years old. I liked it then...But now I like it even more. I must confess that the ending still bring tears to my eyes...even though I've seen it many times on TV. This is one of the most beautiful romantic comedies I have ever seen. The best? "It Happened One Night", which this film resembles very much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pleasant, Innocent Romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's be honest right off the top: no one is going to mistake this movie for a cinematic masterpiece. Having said that, as long as you're not looking for that, but rather just for a very pleasant, mildly funny movie to spend a couple of hours with, "The Goodbye Girl" could be the perfect movie for you. In many ways predictable, the charm of this movie is surely - and I can't think of any other way to describe it - the air of sweetness and innocence that comes across through most of the romance between Paula (Marsha Mason) a former dancer who has to return to show business after she and her young daughter (Quinn Cummings) are dumped by her actor boyfriend and Elliot (Richard Dreyfuss), a struggling actor who sublet the apartment from the ex-boyfriend (except that Paula didn't know about it.) The three (Elliott, Paula and her daughter) find themselves having to live together, and the movie explores the relationship, moving - as I said - in predictable fashionDreyfuss and Mason were excellent in these roles. They worked well together and created a relationship that was believable. In a supporting role, Paul Benedict (better known as Mr. Carlin on "The Jeffersons" TV show) was absolutely hilarious as Elliot's director, who has him playing Shakespeare's Richard III as a limp-wristed flaming homosexual. The air of innocence to the movie (which is really what attracted me to it) was really broken only once - when Paula (in a line I thought grossly out of context with the tenor of the movie) suddenly looks at Elliott (admittedly after a romantic evening) and says "So, are we going to sleep together?" I just didn't think that fit either the character or the movie and it grated on me.But one line doesn't spoil an otherwise enjoyable movie. As I said, it's not a cinematic masterpiece, but it's still worth 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that changed my life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was nine years old and living in rural Nebraska when, instead of getting a babysitter, my parents took me to the movies with them. I had seen children's movies in the theater before, but never a "real grown-up movie." "The Goodbye Girl" was it. Here I was, walking to school from my perfect neighborhood and shopping in the little stores on Main Street and, via a darkened movie theater, I became a "sharp New York girl." (To cop a quote from the film.) I became someone different. I lived in an apartment in New York. (The closest I had ever been to New York City was Kansas City.) I rode in cabs. (I think I saw a cab in Denver once.) I performed on Broadway. (My best experience with theater was watching a high school production of "West Side Story.") I was a quick-talking cool little girl with brown pony tails. (Okay,I did wear my dark hair in pony tails and I was a little girl. But no one could ever in their best day dreams be as cool as Quinn Cummings was in this film.) Today, I am the Rain Man of movie trivia. Oscar Night is like Christmas at my house. (Yes, I tape them. Yes, I can recite the monologues and many of Billy Crystal's opening songs. Hey, it gets boring in Nebraska!) I blame my obsession with film and Hollywood history on "The Goodbye Girl." Richard Dreyfuss is my favorite living actor. I thank Neil Simon in my Oscar speech for Best Screenplay. (And at this point it surprises you I have the speech written...why?) Basically, I love this movie. (Was that over stated or under stated?)</fullReview>

The most pleasant surprise here is the way the role of the "kid" has been handled; this is an atypically smart, non-cute kid. (**1/2)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At their best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are movies that find their respective creators at their best. When that happens, it's magic and we remember why we pay a lot of money to be entertained. "The Goodbye Girl" is one of those movies. Any good movie starts with the script, and in this case, Neil Simon was at his best, right after having finished "Barefoot in the Park" and "The Odd Couple". Dealing with a familiar territory by borrowing from both of those previous movies, he created this magnificent mix of romance and strangers under the same roof. It is, of course, Neil Simon's dialogue that shines, as the main characters seem to come up with some of the wittiest lines you ever heard. Herbert Ross, fresh from "Goodbye Mr. Chips", "Play It Again, Sam" and "The Sunshine Boys", another Simon's piece, was up and ready for dealing with a romantic comedy and created a perfect cast with both Marsha Mason and Richard Dreyfuss. Mason had already proven herself to be an outstanding actress, in more dramatic pieces like "Cinderella Liberty", and a romantic comedy was a perfect change of pace for her. The Goodbye Girl she plays is a heroine but with a more passive and traditional (and maybe realistic) personality than one given to women in the 90's. As any good actor, she knows her character needs to be underplayed to let her partner show off. Because this is a movie for Richard Dreyfuss. Very few people at the time doubted Dreyfuss' ability to be an every day man. He had proven himself in "American Graffitti" and "Jaws". But he was not what you consider a leading man. He had played every single Neil Simon's leading role on theatre but the movie versions always went to the likes of Robert Redford. But with "The Goodbye Girl", he was finally given the chance to shine. And, oh boy, he does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really like Marsha Mason a lot in this movie and felt her role was much more complex than Dreyfuss's often clumsy and irritating one. He's a bit over the top here, but then his character is supposed to be&gt; I just felt he was trying too hard and Mason was the more enjoyable of the 2, specifically because she seems to grow more and has the less manic personality. Plus she cries and screams better and has the better comic timing. A shame her and Diane Keaton were both nominated in the same year for a Best Actress Oscar, delivering as they did, 2 of the richest comedy performances of the 70's.Neil Simon was always rather cutesy with his writing but he found a great trio of actors to round out his story here and they all play well off each other. Quinn Cummings was never better on screen as Mason's world weary young daughter, Lucy, and it was nice to see her nominated, along with Dreyfuss and Mason; Dreyfuss, who beat the odds and went on to nab the Best Actor prize away from movie giants like Richard Burton (Equus) and Woody Allen (Annie Hall). The romance builds nicely, too, so it's not forced, and by the last emotional shot, things have come full circle, and you realize just how sweet the whole thing was...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Neil Simon (Out-of-Towners. Jake's Women) was nominated for best writing, screenplay written directly for the screen for this movie. He has a way with words, and a genius not so commonly available despite then number of writers we have today. He is an original. He does not need to re- write, he just writes it! It is fresh and new material! I appreciate that!Richard Dreyfuss (The Competition, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Mr. Holland's Opus) won the best actor Oscar for the role of Elliott Garfield. Dreyfuss is one of the best American actors of my generation. The number of emotions that he can so brilliantly display in about quarter of a minute is remarkable. Not every actor can do that! He is just wonderful in his craft. Marsha Mason (Frasier, Stella, Nick of Time) was nominated for an best actress Oscar. Quinn Cummings (Family) was nominated for best supporting actress. The movie has rhythm, the matching pitch of words and sounds adds to this classic.Favorite Scenes: Sign on his bedroom door saying: Motel. Elliot leaving a note for Paula to go upstairs for a party. Dinner on the terrace. Lucy, Paula and Elliot 's conversations at dinner table. The "robbery" and running to catch the thief. Poor Elliot can not do anything right!This is one of my favorite movies.

		<shortDescription>First-class romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is that one-in-a-million romantic comedy that expertly manages to be both uproariously funny and genuinely heart-wrenching without be pretentious, heavy handed, or contrived. Famed play-write Neil Simon penned the film's razor sharp script, which ranks among his finest achievements. Unlike other adaptation's of Simon's work such as THE ODD COUPLE (1968) or THE OUT OF TOWNERS (1970), however, THE GOODBYE GIRL is not based on one of Simon's plays, but is rather an original film screenplay penned by Simon himself. Underrated director Herbert Ross wisely chose to film the picture in a simple, straightforward manner that allows Simon's hilarious one-liners to shine brightly and gives the cast plenty of room to let their characterization breathe.Richard Dreyfuss owns the film in a comedic tour de force that won the odd-ball actor a richly deserved slew of industry awards, including the year's Academy Award and Golden Globe as Best Actor (Dreyfuss would remain the youngest Best Actor winner until Adrien Brody took home the award in 2003). Marsha Mason (who was Simon's wife at the time) is also exceptional playing a difficult character who, because she has been burned so many times previously, often reacts unsympathetically to Dreyfuss' affections (Mason also won a Golden Globe and was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar). In shades of Tatum O'Neal, 10-year-old Quinn Cummings is convincingly mature as Mason's world-weary daughter, and was also nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe. A true audience-pleaser in ever since of the word (and a Best Picture Oscar nominee), THE GOODBYE GIRL is a must for fans of reality-based romantic comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheerful, slight.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is divided into two halves. The first half has two themes: (1) the developing relationship between Dreyfus and Mason, and (2) Dreyfus's attempt to establish an acting career. The second half is all about the love story. Already this comment sounds like a term paper. Don't bother saying it. Don't even bother thinking it.The love theme in the first half owes a lot to Simon's classic "The Odd Couple" and it isn't quite as good because the earlier work had characters who were believable. I mean, we all know extraordinarily fussy people and we all know careless slobs. In "The Good-Bye Girl," Mason and her daughter are more or less ordinary bourgeoise. We can believe them, although they're not particularly interesting. But Dreyfus' character has so many bizarre quirks thrust upon him by the script that he's not much more than a cartoon, and not an especially funny one. He burns incense, he meditates and chants, he plays guitar in the nude in the middle of the night. (He ought to have an ugly pet dog too.) Do you know anybody like that?As in "The Odd Couple," two people, he and Mason, begin by irritating one another while forced to live in the same apartment. As their bond deepens, the story gets cute instead of amusing. Simon forces common concerns upon them to get them to know one another. Mason's daughter gets sick (with the flu) and Dreyfus, who likes the girl, sings a tender song to her and accompanies himself on the guitar. I don't know if anyone tears up in scenes like this but I wince. The Simon of "The Odd Couple" would have made chopped liver out of this kind of sentiment. Oscar Madison had a kid too, who lived in California and who showed up on the phone for one scene that was full of genuine affection and equally genuine sarcasm. At the same time, Dreyfus's career worries, which are dispensed with in the second half, are really laugh-out-loud funny. The director (Paul Benedict, who is very good here and in other films) wants to turn Richard III into a fairy in an attempt to internalize his infernal warps. There isn't a hint of this in Shakespeare (who ought to know) or in history either. Dreyfus is outraged and fights against this interpretation but Benedict prevails and Dreyfus winds up mincing around and lisping onstage while the audience walks out. The expression on his face after the performance, when Mason tries to comfort him in his dressing room, is irresistable. If he'd been found crying, it would have spoiled it. Alas, he later returns to the apartment drunk, which isn't funny per se although the script tries to wring laughs from it. Drunkeness played a large part in John Ford's comedies but he had the good sense to leave most of it offscreen.As for the second half of the film, which ends happily of course, I wish we'd had a flashback to Dreyfus's onstage performance again -- "A laugh, a laugh! My kingdom for a laugh!" Still it's a good-natured movie, not insulting in any way, just spotty. The good spots are reason enough to watch it. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely Little Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's difficult to imagine that "The Goodbye Girl" won Richard Dreyfuss an Oscar, though he is very, very good in this romantic comedy, also starring Marsha Mason. Like most plays/scripts by Neil Simon, it is funny and light -- and a very pleasant way to spend two hours with a bag of popcorn in your lap. But a great film, it is not, even compared to other light romantic comedies, perhaps because it lacks emotional depth as does most of Simon's work. The fact that Simon and Ms. Mason were married for a time is an interesting but weightless fact. I'm not one of those who believes that no comedy is ever Oscar-worthy, but in comparison with several Hepburn/Tracy vehicles and Cary Grant's best work, there's nothing really remarkable about "The Goodbye Girl." Except that it won him an Oscar, Dreyfuss will not be remembered for "The Goodbye Girl." As for Ms. Mason, who is also quite good in this movie, she left few tracks in her long career. See it. I think you'll enjoy it. But don't set your expectations too high.</fullReview>

It's often tough to get really good acting from a ten year old. As far as Richard Dreyfus and Marsha Mason, they did very well, delivered all of Neil Simon's one-liners with panache, and played engaging characters, but I'm not really sure either were Oscar-caliber performances.

		<shortDescription>Dreyfuss is adorable, but i cannot be happy with the message of this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS**Let me start by saying I love a lot of things about The Goodbye Girl. The Eliot character is adorable excitable really cute late 70s Richard Dreyfuss. And Quinn Cummings is fantastic. Both their roles are cleverly written. But this film is backwards from a feminist perspective, when other late 70's films like Annie Hall, were showing women as independent and competent beings wanting to change themselves.This is not the case with the Goodbye Girl. While the film can boast witty dialogue, looking at it from a feminist perspective, it is just wretched and boasts no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Mason's character is co-dependent and immature at the beginning of the film and shows herself to be the same way at the end. Mason's initial sass is promising, but once Dreyfuss wins her over, she falls back into her co-dependent patterns. I could not, could not, be happy at the end of this film or feel any sort of contentment with the ending. I can't feel happy at Mason's unbridled enthusiasm; she jumps when Eliot calls and has no reservations about leaving her 10 year old daughter to follow him on a movie set. Even though she doesn't go, it is clear her priorities lie with her man's interests, not her daughter's, providing a terrible message that having a man in your life should be your top priority --and that you should give up your career or any kind of individual aspirations once you find one.Maybe what bothered me is that Mason gave 100 percent of the power in the relationship to Dreyfuss-this is apparent in the end, it seems like the future and happiness of both Mason's Paula and her daughter is hinged on the whether Dreyfuss' Eliot is coming back or not. That doesn't leave me happy and it doesn't leave me satisfied and it doesn't leave me pleased that the characters are back together. In contrast, Annie Hall, with its more complex ending, was more satisfying. Annie had grown and changed throughout the movie. I thought this was more a reflection of the late 70's woman, or what woman were trying to become in that era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all-time favorite films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from Arthur and The American President, this movie is one of my all-time favorite films. Neil Simon wrote a perfect script that really brings out the best in this film. After her boyfriend deserts her, Paul McFadden (Played to perfection by Marsha Mason) is devastated and spends the first few minutes crying over it. In the middle of the night, a mysterious stranger comes along and claims that her boyfriend sublet the apartment to him. This stranger is played by Academy-Award winning actor Richard Dreyfuss as Elliot Garfield, a struggling actor who is frustrated most of the time over Paula's antics. Let me tell you something. Richard Dreyfuss's Oscar for this film was well-deserved. The way he acted out this role was silly as well as serious. Finally, the last player we have in this film is Paula's daughter Lucy (Quinn Cummings). I have never seen such a impressive performance by a child. Lucy almost seems like she is grown up in this film.Although it takes a long while before they eventually fall in love, the path the movie takes is enough to keep you smiling.RENT THIS ONE!! Do not wait. This is a film I highly recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hold on tight, I am going on a bit of a rant. "The Goodbye Girl" was a very frustrating movie for me to watch. While it's clearly a very good film and I liked Richard Dreyfus' character very much, the writing irritated me as it seemed a bit irresponsible.My problem is with Marsha Mason's character. The film begins and her live-in has apparently dumped her--moving out and leaving a 'Dear Jane' letter (nice guy, huh?). You feel a bit sorry for her until you soon learn that this bum was STILL married and she knew it! And, she'd been married once before. Now it's obvious she's not good at making decisions involving guys. BUT, here's what really bothered me...she had a young daughter and seemed to have no problem with her kid seeing all this chaos. And, in a weird twist, the little girl sounds like the mother--dispensing wisdom and rolling with the punches. And, Mason often seemed to expect her kid to parent her--making her feel good about herself when bad things happen. Considering how wildly popular the film was, obviously most folks didn't feel the way I did. I just found her character difficult to like and the film could have been better had she had failed relationships BUT they were not caused by her own stupidity. Sleeping with a married man?! What man would want a lady like this? To me, this does NOT seem to be the makings for a romantic film! It's sad, really, as the rest of the film was excellent. Richard Dreyfus was exceptional and I could see why he got the Oscar--he was likable but flawed and quite charming. Mason, on the other hand, seemed like an emotional basket-case in need of saving--not a woman a reasonable man would want in his life. So, as a result of loving and hating the film, I was left VERY emotionally torn--frustrated and touched at the same time (which is a very strange feeling!). Well worth seeing but I can't help but wonder if folks watching the film internalized this weird message and perhaps thought Mason's parenting wasn't that bad and might have unconsciously emulated this. Kids need a lot more security in their lives than the one in this film got. It sure seemed like a case of child neglect in order for the mother to make herself feel good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose in a way I owe a debt of gratitude to this film-it certainly ranks on my list of "essentials" for cutting my own critical chops. The "essentials" I'm referring to are films I absolutely despised that virtually everyone I knew (and the Oscars) liked. For years the mere mention of "pan-tees-hang-ing-in-the-bathroom" could sent me into a rage. Listen, I like Neil Simon- probably more than I should-but this film is crap. The by-play between the leads that usually makes Simon funny falls flat with these two truly mismatched actors. Dreyfuss overacts shamelessly (it's his m.o. in virtually all his lead roles- like Bette Midler he's really only suitable for supporting roles) and begs the question: If John Simon could call Streisand "ugly" what do you call a guy who looks like a gerbil with whiskers? He's truly grotesque, and not just when he's playing gay Richard III (his best moment) his Oscar for this smacks of self congratulation on the part of Hollywood. Marsha Mason is mediocre also a career best. Fortunately for me, sanity prevailed and Dreyfuss sank to a level more befitting his talents (he blamed coke- I prefer to take the optimistic view that the world just came to its senses).This isn't the worst Neil Simon film- just the most overpraised. I watch what I can bear of it from time to time when I feel like patting myself on the back for trusting my judgement way back when.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Goodbye Girl at times especially within the apartment seems like like a theatrical play probably more or less because of the demonstrative, ,energetic and flamboyant acting of the adult leads Dreyfuss and Marsh. Quinn Cummings deadpans quite a few one-liners mostly amusing because of her age, but she steals many of the scenes from the leads contrasting their loud energy with quiet underplaying. The story seemed a bit run-of-the-mill, however the dialog keeps you occupied, and it's an interesting time-warp getting whisked away back to 1977 auto showroom floors and all the 70s styles. I thought the relationship and romance developed satisfactorily however Marsh's neurotic reactions made the final 10-15 min sort of anticlimactic and annoying. Apparently Dreyfuss won an Oscar for his efforts - not sure he's THAT good, but he holds her attention well....worth a watch if you like older stuff.</fullReview>

He has great lines &amp; well executed. Marsha M. and "Lucy" were superior. He got the Oscar and not them. He should have but all should have. Odd bit, as Richard D. flaked out in other movies and politics, I now find him less believable in this film. I wonder what a then-younger Harrison Ford would have brought? The writing is superior and IMHO, the writing carried it and Richard D. was perfect in execution. Marsha M and Lucy, were naturals. His 'edge' was maintained so he has a complex personality. The machine-gun like delivery of the listed quotes are just that; however, film after film, it is the same. He won a deserved Oscar. He could not be beat that year. I regret the others did not.

		<fullReview>Neil Simon knows how to write stories about quirky relationships and THE GOODBYE GIRL is no exception.The moment RICHARD DREYFUSS arrives on a rainy day and sets himself up as the sub-let tenant of MARSHA MASON's crowded looking apartment, we know we're in for a contest of wills before a rather predictable happy ending.It's sort of like THE ODD COUPLE, but with a change of sexes. Interesting addition is the role of Mason's daughter, the ten-year old QUINN CUMMINGS, precocious beyond her years who gets to liven things up considerably with her outspoken remarks and own eccentric ways.But it's RICHARD DREYFUSS who really nails the character of the struggling young actor who can't abide by common rules of courtesy and is completely self-absorbed (as most actors are). He creates a believable portrait of the man who frustrates Mason (her crying jags become almost too much at times), but always within the realm of reality. I'm not a fan of this particular actor, but do think he deserved his Best Actor award for this role.Summing up: Not Simon's best, but still very worthwhile viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simon, Dreyfuss, and Mason at their Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1977's THE GOODBYE GIRL is probably the best comedy that Neil Simon wrote directly for the screen, filled with his usual razor sharp dialogue and his quirky characters brought vividly to life by a wonderful cast. Richard Dreyfuss walked off with the Best Actor Oscar for his brilliant comic turn here as Elliott Garfield, a small town actor who moves to New York to star in a revival of RICHARD III and, upon arrival at the apartment he has sublet from an old friend, learns the apartment is still occupied by said friend's girlfriend, Paula McFadden (Marsha Mason) and her daughter Lucy (Quinn Cummings)who were not informed that the worm sublet the apartment after ditching them to make a movie in Italy. Naturally, the three end up sharing the apartment and though you can pretty much guess the outcome, the journey is quite enjoyable, especially Dreyfuss' hysterical take on the character of Richard III and his encounter with some muggers who steal Paula's purse. This movie is a delight from start to finish thanks primarily to the genius that is Neil Simon and the winning performances from Dreyfuss and Mason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a fine comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Neil Simon has a way of making a hit movie. "The Goodbye Girl" is a real gem in the comedy world. Here you have a single woman with a 10 year-old daughter who got a mouth that won't let up. Here you have a former dancer name Paula McFadden(Marsha Mason) whose heart been broken when her boyfriend went to Italy instead of California. Her daughter Lucy(Quinn Cummings), does have a thing to say about someone. Believe me she's brutally honest! No way I see any nativity in her. Then there's Elliot Garfield(Richard Dreyfuss), a egocentric actor who gets stiffed by Paula's boyfriend on the payment. So technically they had to share the building under his rules. Paula may not like it, but she should be mad at Tony, not Elliot. Elliot is full of character, and wonder, despite being a health nut, he keeps himself balanced. Except when they were doing the play about "Richard III", that really got his goat. Being the goodbye girl is always emotional, but when Elliot got a movie deal in the West Coast, this goodbye is only temporary. Very fun to watch, a lot of literary quotes to live off."The Goodbye Girl" is an energy filled, emotionally intimidating, and heart warming movie I've ever watched. Plus being from New York myself, it's a real keeper! 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is about 30 years old and yet so modern!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know; the whole set of the movie seems like the thousand other pieces of mediocre films that surged in the movie theaters during the beginning of the "mass production era" (a.k.a. 80's) of Hollywood. But here we are talking about a gem among gravel, "The Goodbye Girl".The script is surprisingly clever and amusing, and the jokes overwhelmingly saucy, like those we have had experienced after the late 90's or so (even if the movie isn't much of a comedy). The temperament of the character of "Elliot Garfield" gives the writer the unique opportunity to unleash his revelations of social intercourse, giving each of us invaluable lessons about the human relationships; all these through the mouth of the middle-aged actor (astounding acting by Richard Dreyfuss).I definitely suggest this picture for a cosy night and a sweet taste left in your mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE BEST ROMANTIC COMEDY IN YEARS!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one movie I regret not seeing in the big screen for reasons that I'm too young to go alone in movie house and that I won't appreciate the movie my age at that time. This really enjoyable and inspiring romantic comedy is by far, for me, the best movie of that genre that outshone the ones shown in the 90's.The movie's success in all fields is mainly due to all the people responsible for this one: from the writer itself Mr. Neil Simon; to the wonderful actors Mr. Richard Dreyfuss, Ms. Marsha Mason and Quinn Cummings,the director Herbert Ross and certainly not the least is Bread's David Gates who sung the theme of the same title.Frankly speaking, I don't expect the film to be one of my favorite films of all times. But since the movie surpassed my expectations because of the wonderful plot and characters, I don't get tired of watching this film over and over again. Storywise, it is simple but it paid off through Mr. Simon's sparkling and witty dialogues. And good to know that the film and actors are given Academy Award recognitions (Mr.Dreyfuss having won the best actor undeniably).Above all, the inspiration the movie brings that one of us has his/her time to be loved once more without ever to be left alone again. And yes, the film manage to move me into tears every time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Richard Dreyfuss Captures the Oscar With This One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Dreyfuss won a somewhat curious Oscar as a struggling stage actor in New York who is forced to live with Marsha Mason (Oscar-nominated) and her young daughter. Based on material written by Neil Simon, the film is definitely funny, heart-warming, and good overall, but just never really accomplishes anything truly special in the end. Smart direction by Herbert Ross is probably the one thing that saved "The Goodbye Girl". Good overall, but far from being excellent. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreyfuss and Mason bicker towards love in original Neil Simon screen comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably the best beloved of all Neil Simon films. It garnered five Oscar noms (Picture, Actress- Mason, Screenplay, Supporting Actress- Quinn) and won an Oscar for Dreyfuss. In addition it WON four Golden Globes (Film, Actor, Actress, Screenplay) and Quinn was nominated. It's a tried and true comedy formula - the couple who begin hating each other's guts eventually fall in love. The premise of both Mason and Dreyfuss playing struggling artists (he an actor and she a dancer)works for them - they both give highly emotional and charged performances that might not have been believable had they been portraying say, a lawyer and a housewife. Mason has the hardest task - she LISTENS to what Dreyfuss is saying even when she hates his guts - and when he strikes a chord of truth, she stops and thinks about it. This happens often enough to effect her eventual change from a distrustful, angry woman to one with an understanding and newly warm lease on life. It IS ultimately her movie - it's ABOUT her. However, as she hands scene after scene to Mr. Dreyfuss, he doesn't play ball as well as she. He holds these tosses, no- clutches them to his bosom, refusing to toss them back and forth and ultimately, hams it up a lot. He gives a bravura comedy performance, but I'll bet it took all the gumption Ms. Mason could muster to keep up with him. All in all, it is quite enjoyable, moves at a mighty clip, and has a happy ending. The precocious child, played by Quinn Cummings, is most amusing. Once again Ms. Mason shows how adept she is at playing with adolescents - treating them with respect and lavishing all kinds of love on them. Certainly a most enjoyable film for the whole family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Goodbye!!! (A Shame About the Crap Before It!!!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"...and the winner is...Richard Burton for "Equus"(!)", is, most unfortunately, a line that has never been uttered. If he had only minced, "...and I don't like the panties, hanging in the bathroom", punctuating each syllable like the drumbeat of a Roman slave ship, he may have won, instead of that other "Dick", Richard Dreyfuss. Then again, Burton had a Paul Schrader screenplay, the luscious Jenny Agutter in support, and a stableful of blinded horses!!! Not exactly the Oscar punch of a Neil Simon screenplay, a limp (is there any other kind?) Marsha Mason performance (Oscar nominated) and the most precocious child performance this side of the little bastard who played "Dondi"(also Oscar nominated, Quinn Cummings, not Dondi). Dreyfuss went on to portray himself again and again in film and television roles. Burton went on to die, without being nominated again. Oh well, with God being dead and everything, it's easy to see how things like this can happen. They shoot good films don't they? Yes they do, so don't say hello to "The Goodbye Girl".</fullReview>
