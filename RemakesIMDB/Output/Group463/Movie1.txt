		<shortDescription>A classy piece of work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget all the explosions, car chases, crazy villains, special effects... The Thomas Crown Affair is not an action movie. It압 not even a thriller. Instead, it압 a well-done cat-and-mouse movie that압 smart, entertaining and very sexy. If you had to use one word to describe the film it would have to be sophisticated. The movie might appeal more to mature audiences as both the leading man and the leading lady are over 40 years old. Pierce Brosnan can obviously do other roles beside James Bond, but the role of Thomas Crown is at least somewhat similar to 007. Both guys "enjoy women" and are very suave. Overall, Brosnan gives a solid performance and is overshadowed only by Rene Russo who simply oozes sexuality and class. She is simply perfect in her role and though she압 twice as old as I am I find her a real knockout. Not only is she extremely hot, but also a very talented and charismatic actress. A perfect combination! The classy dance scene between Brosnan and Russo belongs to the most sexually-charged scenes in history and the following love-making scene manages to be both sexy and stylish. Usually nude scenes in Hollywood movies seem somehow "uneasy", but in this movie the scene is done in real style and with sensual music the atmosphere is sizzling. Who would want a disposable bimbo like Britney Spears when you could have a real class-act woman like Rene Russo? I would also like to mention Bill Conti whose simple yet refined music is simply outstanding. Just listen to the music during the scene in which Crown and Banning go glider flying... You can just close your eyes and listen to this wonderful music. Now I have to find the soundtrack for this film! I guess I should mention that I았e never seen the original Thomas Crown, but now I don앖 even have to bother as its updated version is a true pleasure to watch. I have nothing negative to say about it so just go get this film on DVD and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Thomas" is the "Crown" Jewel for your collection... SEE IT!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This DVD was an impulse buy, pure and simple. My wife and I like Pierce Brosnan, and I have enjoyed Renee Russo's other works, so what did I have to lose? Only my mind! This film was positively one of the most enjoyable, nail-biting, suspenseful romantic capers ever made. A remake of the steamy 1968 Steve McQueen flick updated to the sleek and self-referential 90s, "Thomas Crown" features Brosnan as the title character - a bored billionaire businessman in the business of "acquisitions". For a thrill, he heists an extremely valuable Monet from the New York Museum right under the noses of security guards, cops, and about a thousand unsuspecting museum-goers. Renee Russo is the very sexy, very worldly Catherine Banning, whose insurance company underwrites the painting - and she is determined to get it back at any cost... But the cost just may be her soul as she woos, and then falls under the spell of the enigmatic Crown. Will Russo discover the location of the Monet? Will she rat out Thomas Crown? Or is Crown manipulating her affections like Bobby Fisher manipulates the pieces on a chess board?What we have here is a high-speed chase film whose vehicle is clever dialog, rich and exotic direction, and more than a little sexual tension! Brosnan, as Crown, is ever the cool Brit charmer whose every word and action are as calculated as the movements of a Rolex. Russo smoulders every time she appears on screen. And when the two of them get together, the chemical reaction is pure dynamite.Dennis Leary has a nice bit as a streetwise NYPD detective on the case, who dispenses advice to Russo's Banning, and watches her begin to spiral out of control. His role here most likely resulted in the deserved attempt at a television series on ABC ("The Job").The action in the film moves exotically from caper to cover-up and back with dizzying speed... All the while, we are kept guessing about the motivations of the two lead, and find ourselves eagerly anticipating their next move. When the final checkmate comes, we are left totally bewildered, befuddled, and baffled... which is most-likely the director's intention!On all levels, "The Thomas Crown Affair" will steal the hearts of men and women alike... but for different reasons - Men can enjoy the action and thrill of the chase, and Crown's ability to win over the most beautiful women and his attempt to get away with the ultimate heist... Ladies can marvel at the suave Brosnan and his life of extreme wealth, and all-the-while wonder if he will betray her, or if she will betray him...I will not betray you... I ain't saying!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie - Much Better Than The Original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was wonderful - much better than the "original" The characters were more interesting, the plot more interesting!The entire cast gives marvellous performances, Rene Russo and Pierce Brosnan are wonderful, sexy, intelligent and never boring!I am tired of hearing about Rene's age being a factor, there are sexy talented women of all ages! Her performance is what thrilled me - she gives a multifaceted performance. And its interesting that most of the critical people of her on this site are male. I guess they can't handle a strong- yet vulnerable, intelligent woman.Kudos to Pierce Brosnan for selecting a woman lead who is not only his contemporary but equal in intelligence and moxy!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original reworked right.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obligatory comparison to the first film: The first Thomas Crown Affair really wasn't that great with its split screens that would make even Brian De Palma sick. Like other films from that era of history, it's lost some of its shock with time but unlike true classics, Thomas Crown Affair has lost a lot of its charm. Worth a viewing, but not worth worshipping.Only vague concepts carry over from film to film, really. The same basic plot curve, same basic events, same basic characters, except everything is retold and reinterpreted from a different point of view. And I much prefer John McTiernan's interpretation despite the more glaring plot holes such as 'Why didn't the security tape reveal who set the briefcase in the gallery to begin with?' Theoretically the culprit could've been caught then and there, but then there'd be no movie. The caper's execution is rather spectacular, far more entertaining than the original's, though much less likely to happen. But who cares, really? McTiernan directed this as a film you can't take 100% seriously anyway. This is a fun cat and mouse movie, not a documentary.The premise-an art theft-strikes me as more interesting than the original's robbery; besides, how many films have bank robberies? How many films steal art? It's something different.The characters and their portrayals are colorful and interesting, walking a thin line of camp but never pushing it too far. This movie isn't about 'Everyman' nor is it meant to. It's about a billionaire who gets his kicks out of high stake gambles and wages-how do you do that without a larger than life portrayal? I particularly liked the ending sequence, as goofy, perhaps corny as it is, it's still fun. Especially the music selection, Nina Simone's Sinnerman, a well chosen track. Bill Conti provides the underlying score, which proves quite unique having a slightly bouncy 'piano recital' quality to its first few themes. Very fitting for the museum setting. It's a CD worth purchasing for the sake of variety alone. In the end, Thomas Crown Affair works not because of the film's subjects or its characters . . . it works because of -how- it portrays everything. Its tone is fun and relaxing, and it never tries to take itself too seriously. After all, we are at the movies and not a training seminar . ..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good film, but a very average remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, what can I say after watching this film, being a fan of the original. To begin with, I enjoyed it as it was almost a 90's play by play remake, and I am always pleased to see how a 60's or 70's classic would have looked 20 something years later. The early scenes in the film were very close to the original, with the business deal going through, and then Crown going to observe the heist; although participating this time around, and so, with what I saw I saw a hell of a lot of promise to shine up to the original. The heist seems in both are superbly conceived and very well filmed, with just the right amount of tension about the problems arising. Good stuff.Enter Russo, dressed as a total Dunaway clone (Remember the headscarf?) and with some scenes of total over acting which could have worked well but on the whole didn't. Where Russo seems to let go and enjoy herself is a slip mistake that the character would never have done; Dunaway ALWAYS kept her cool in the original.Enter the cat and mouse thriller element of the film. I have seen a few reviews here that say that this dragged the film along, slowing it down considerably. However, this film, in both versions, is not about a robbery, it is about the chase. The point of the film is the exchanges between the two protagonists, each trying to catch the other out; and this is the brilliance of the film, because it isn't a visual action plot with little in it that so many films are today. This makes you watch, this makes you observe and it makes you think.Moving on to the character of Crown by Brosnan. Some people have said that Brosnan was hollow and one dimensional, with no background to his motivation to the robbery. This is EXACTLY the point and this is why the ending of the 1999 version does NOT work. Thomas Crown only has two things that he cares about: Greed and acquisition. The scene in both versions with the business deal at the beginning is the evidence at this, with the corporate suits joking about "Thomas Crown actually selling something" then we find out that he only sold it because, unknown to them, they were offering 30 million more than anyone else. All Crown cares about is possessing as much as he can, this is why he has been alone all this time. And, with this being the point of the character, that is why the ending of the film is so disappointing and unbelievable compared to the original. Crown desired to own the painting and he would not have given this up for the love of a woman, because, although it is obvious he wants a woman to love him, he cannot love women, because he can only love what he owns, and he wants to own everything. The original version, with McQueen deceiving Dunaway, after she betrayed him and then leaving her on the plane is a much more convincing ending.Another unconvincing aspect is the comparison between the McQueen/Dunaway and Brosnan/Russo relationships. Firstly, the dance scene comes nowhere near comparison to the chess scene of the original; and the dance scene is very poorly filmed as well. The chess scene showed both characters attempts at dominance over each other, their lust to win over each other, and they sexual tension between them as they play with the chess pieces, slowly and seductively. The dance scene is a quick montage of unclear movement with the only piece of sexual tension being Brosnan laying his hands on Russo. All the dominance that Dunaway had in the original was disposed of and Russo caved into to sleeping with Crown very easily. Then, there is the Brosnan/Russo sex scene; which in my opinion was HIGHLY unnecessary. McQueen and Dunaway never needed to do a nude scene together, as the sexual tension between the two was so obvious that it could be cut with a bread knife. However, Brosnan and Russo do not have that touch, the spark was nowhere near as big, and the inclusion of a nude scene still does not bring it anywhere near the status of attraction that the original couple had.This film could have been a classic remake if it didn't try to be so politically correct. The only reason why the remake switched from a bank heist to art theft is because, in today's world, armed robbery cannot be presented as an elegant theft. This is ridiculous, as the reason that the original's heist was so smooth was because of the planning, timing and element of no one of the criminals meeting until midway through the heist; all goes on while McQueen watches from across the road. Where was the planning and recruitment in this remake? Oh yes, Russo mentioned it so quickly, it would have been dismissed faster than one of Brosnan's butler's lines. And the idea of a happy ending, with both of the characters, now definitely lovers, flying off into the sunset with plans for happiness together. Garbage. These two characters are selfish and greedy because they only look at for number one in a dog eats dog world. McQueen's Crown saw this, knowing to drop Dunaway or go to jail; and this PC happy ending is just not compatible with this film; as with a cat and mouse thriller, someone has to lose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thomas/Catherine Love Feast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thomas Crown Affair is an exception to the Hollywood rule that the remake must be true to the original. In 1968, Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway served up a 1960s sexy confection of skimpy clothes and clever heists. John McTiernan turns the flick into a sultry, almost jaded, romance. Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan, slick from practicing seduction as James Bond) is a power-lunching, billionaire robber-baron who gets his kicks stealing art treasures from taxpayer-supported museums. Catherine Olds Banning (played by the tough, but sexy Rene Russo) is the insurance company detective determined to get back the painting he steals at the beginning of the film. If she can get it, she will save her insurance conglomerate a nice chunk of change. The billionaire and the detective try everything to outsmart each other including a highly charged love affair that's a heated mix of business and pleasure. Russo looks very good with her clothes off.The director's attention to the detail of the sumptuous, luxury sets, provides a suitably comfy backdrop for the steamy action. McTiernan also directs the action pieces almost as well as one might expect from the director Die Hard.Brosnan and Russo supply most of the heat for the developing romance. The witty dialog by Leslie Dixon make the film move by with enough grace to paper over the fact that it is the sex we are interested in. Russo is beautiful, stylish, smart, self-possessed, and incredibly sexy.Denis Leary gets a good character role as a police detective smitten with Russo, and Faye Dunaway (the love interest in 1968) gets a wholly enjoyable cameo as Brosnan's therapist, who helps him try to figure out why he is such an irresponsible business man.One wonders now, after Enron, Tyco, and other big payoff corporate heists, just whom Crown is robbing to pay for his high-tech robbery crew. How many of his company's employees will have to give up their pensions or health benefits to keep his company looking good on Wall Street. Who cares? It's just a movie! Actually, it is a great date movie. Pop it in. See if it works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bang-Up Fun Fresh Re-Make</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hooray for Hollywood! The world may be falling apart so like we needed money spent on a remake of "The Thomas Crown Affair." But then heck if Tinseltown in all its unoriginality doesn't do a bang-up fun job of unreality with characters who have no place in the Unreel World, from the classy looking opening credits to Sting covering "Windmills of my Mind" over the closing credits. In the opening scene I'm thinking, wait I know that woman's voice and voila it's Faye Dunaway from the original film as Crown's shrink - I cheered out loud (OK so I was the only one in the audience that got the joke).Pierce Brosnan and Renee Russo are an age-appropriate couple with genuine fireworks and chemistry (with help from director John McTiernan and editor John Wright in the tango and copulation scenes).There's unconventionally good music choices - that tango is from Three Penny Opera of all things and a terrific use of Nina Simone's "Sinner Man" in a marvelous Magritte-inspired ironically tense heist scene. Brosnan's trainer gets a credit, as there's plenty of skin. Russo laughs, a gorgeous belly laugh, unlike so many frozen femmes fatale.The credits also say that no museum was used as a locale, so gosh they really recreated the Met amazingly accurately (and how much did that cost?), though it didn't seem crowded enough Crown goes in at 9 when the museum doesn't open until 11.I would think this is a great date movie.

		<shortDescription>Emotional Chess . . . updated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, it's not a cookie-cutter remake of the original staring Mr. McQueen and Ms. Dunaway - so no comparison required.You might say Brosnan was typecast by Bond, and the idea of a suave player getting one over on yet another woman might be the obvious outcome, but not this time! Instead we're treated to a sophisticated game of cops and robbers, played out in this stylish and seductive entertainment. Mr. Brosnan (Thomas) is at the top of his game and may be involved in something illegal. Ms. Russo (Catherine) is called in to investigate, claiming an office and sharing confidences with the local police department looking for clues. Catherine epitomises sophistication with hair, makeup and fashions styled to perfection. She's an understatement of success; a woman playing a man's game, bounty-hunting life and sex on her own terms and 'enjoying the chase'. Once Catherine is on the trail of Thomas Crown you'll join her in a hedonistic game of one-upmanship. She's done this kind of work before and must stay on her toes if she's going to implicate the wealthy Thomas Crown. The local cops and cultured community believe Mr. Crown to be beyond reproach; an untouchable pillar of wealth and good taste.These two characters exist in their luxurious world through strange circumstance and have made it their own through hard work and some bluffing. The movie provides glimpses into their lifestyles, and at the same time, keeps them both just outside what you'd expect from a wealthy businessman and a woman working for an insurance company.Supporting character Mr. Leary makes a cynical, yet caring detective attempting to save face by nabbing Thomas Crown - however it's quite obvious in a city the size of New York that a bored millionaire looking for thrills by staging a theft is not his priority. Mr. Leary is guilty of a bit of cussing and jaded police behaviour, but ya 'gotta hope he's still on the force.The story races from one clue to the next, and we glimpse a world where time means nothing, and money is just, well, not an issue. The film really sets the tone for the lush life with ultra-posh, elegant sets, millionaire-hobbies and exotic locations. The soundtrack is perfect, giving the entire movie an upmarket, worldly feel that befits a modern romance.This is really a love story for anyone who imagines being whisked away from the mundane into places that you've only read or heard about in glossy magazines. It's a film for any person out there who'd like to have the freedom to do what they want and damn the consequences. Well, either that or have enough money to do anything, then disappear. There is some hot on-screen chemistry between Thomas and Catherine, making the love scenes, coupled with the sexy music and breathtaking backgrounds, erotic. They have a healthy appetite for each other so the love scenes in his apartment and 'island retreat' are the 'stuff that dreams are made of.'Yes, there are little snafus, such as a painting being folded in a manner that would permanently ruin it, and the usual gaffes that serious film-goers will pick over - but heck, it's just a movie and a love story - let yourself go and imagine you're a woman who's just crashed a black tie event in a dress making every man in the room salivate, or that you're the man she's heading for on the dance floor - then have fun with it . . . In the end, for all their cunning, Thomas and Catherine must decide if they can trust each other, just like most men and women must do in any love story. What you may find hard to decide though, is who to root for, and who really wins the game of cat and mouse at the end of this movie.</fullReview>

An anticipation will build on and you will enjoy a climax every 15 minutes or so.This movie is one of its kind, not to mention Pierce Brosnan who looks tailor made for this role.Every few years a movie comes that you remember throughout your life, sometimes it may appeal to one group and detract another, but the people to whom it appeals, it touches their heart and they are deeply influenced by it. It is one of those movies After Clint Eastwood it was Pierce Brosnan who could actually play a real, relaxed , laid back, mature man in Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Those who maintain that remakes never are as good as the original on which they are based should take a look at this film.Pierce Brosnan recaptures the rebellious cool that Steve McQueen displayed in the original film of the same name and adds a further gloss and polish to the character.While the story line remains basically true to the original, it has been modernised and comes across even tighter.As in the original, Thomas Crown is a successful businessman to whom everything comes easily, so much so that everyday dealings leave him bored. Bored enough to strike out in a non-violent way and stage a super art heist, where the thrill of staging the caper and the following cat and mouse game to stay ahead of a feisty female insurance investigator assigned to the case provides the kicks he is missing.Eventually and expectedly, the relationship develops and the viewer is dragged on an interlude of exotic locales besotted with the props of a very good life.The lead players display a sizzling chemistry that propels the film along at a scorching pace, culminating in an ending that is better resolved than the original McQueen edition if you are a sentimentalist.Good support cast, with a cameo by Faye Funaway (who was the female lead for the original), help the film along. If one listens carefully to the background music, the original theme ('Windmills Of Your Mind') may also be heard. It is touches like these that pay homage to the original version, while allowing this renewed edition to have an identity all its own.Overall, a classy and dynamic remake that scores highly on its own.</fullReview>

It is not about the heist nor the painting, though the soundtrack was excellent. It's about love between 2 person who refused to believe that they are capable of being loved.Never a fan of Pierce but this movie certainly cemented his status as an actor. None of his James Bond movie came close to delivering such a superb performance. You can always count on Rene to deliver her best in any movie.You can say I am inlove with this movie and yes you are right indeed.

In an unusual tribute to the original, Faye Dunaway is cast as Brosnan's psychologist with whom he discusses his disillusionment with life and love. Even the normally annoying Denis Leary gives a good performance as the embittered detective who watches Russo's struggles between her heart and her job. Frankie Faison has an excellent supporting role(most may remember him as the landlord in Eddie Murphy's "Coming to America"). The film is dazzlingly shot, the yacht racing sequences are really beautiful. And above all, it's an intense love story that won't leave you disappointed. Very steamy scenes between the two make this a date movie, not a movie you watch with your kids!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without having seen the original version with Steve McQueen, I cannot give an opinion to which I like best. I did however enjoy this Pierce Brosnan remake. At the time of this writing the votes on this site between the two movies were only separated by a tenth of a point. It has mediocre to poor acting, but it is still quite entertaining. As a bit of trivia Faye Dunaway played Thomas Crown's shrink in this film. She also played the investigator in the earlier version, however the name of her character (Vicki Anderson) is different than the name of the investigator played by Renee Russo (Catherine Banning) in this updated version.The story is about a rich thief named Thomas Crown (Brosnan)who steals a 100 million painting by Claude Monet, but to what end. Catherine Banning (Russo) is the investigator working for the insurance company to recover the artwork. The story has some nice twists and turns. I would recommend taking a look at it. However if you have young children you may want to see the film after lights out, because of the nude/love scenes performed by Renee Russo and Pierce Brosnan.</fullReview>

He is utterly convincing as a rich playboy and an entrepreneur. While Faye Dunaway did a marvelous job in the original and I have no criticism of her performance, I am enchanted with the performance of Rene Russo.Brosnan and Russo were a pair that were perfectly matched. The soundtrack was fantastic, even including "The Windmills of Your Mind" from the original. Adding Dunaway as a Psychiatrist was a masterful touch.This is much more of a caper film as you actually saw some beautiful work her. The "other woman" was beefed up and really added to the plot. The ending was much more satisfying, and, unlike the previous version which had to be rated "R" because the bad guy won, this actually earned the rating with some magnificent scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am very fond of the Norman Jewison original particularly for Dunnaway and for the song The Windmills of My Mind. This is a very worthy remake, and almost on par in my opinion, and I thought I'd never say that after seeing far too many pointless ones along the odd truly great one. The story is not quite as convincing here, it does have some great scenes that also some that don't quite work like the dance scene which was not very well filmed and didn't enhance the story as much as the chess scene of the original. However, visually it is very stylish, with striking locations, crisp photography and editing and great fashions. The direction as expected from John McTiernan is very convincing, the screenplay is taut and the soundtrack is memorable. Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo are fine leads, and their chemistry is somewhat steamier than the original's, and there is also some great support from Denis Leary and Faye Dunnaway herself. Overall, a more than worthy remake, loose of course but very stylish and classy. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When stealing a Monet from the Metropolitan Museum of Art is the only way left to get your jollies, how does a brilliant, successful narcissist find greater challenges in the 90's? By matching wits with another brilliant, successful narcissist, of course. This glossy, romantic trifle shares only the cat-and-mouse premise of the memorable, then-innovative 1968 caper film (starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway), but the updated result is still vastly entertaining. What's especially impressive is that this reworking actually features leads who are older than their 60's counterparts when the original was made. Brosnan and Russo, both well into their forties, are an attractive match and convincingly play passionate lovers as well as any WB-network twenty-somethings competing for your movie dollar these days. Especially pleasing in "The Thomas Crown Affair" are plot points that steer clear of developments exhibited in the original; this remake (for a change) is fresh enough on its own terms that any degree of familiarity with the 1968 version is immaterial. Particularly satisfying are the climax and denouement which develop naturally and delightfully on their own terms. The premise is seductive, the romance is appealing and the direction by McTiernan is assured.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Having never seen the original, a fresh review.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen the original Thomas Crown Affair, but from all accounts it sounds like a classic. With that, not in mind shall we say, I came to the new version without any set views of how it should, or shouldn't be.It struck me that it was a very stylish film, the music was bold, unlike many of today's soundtracks that ripple past you, and the whole package reminded me of a sixties film yet with a very modern approach.I, miraculously, managed to forget about Brosnan being Bond for the entire film, although it has to be said that his acting doesn't change between roles. Russo was stunning, and I don't mean for her looks or her lingering topless shots. I thought she made this film with some very believable acting and provided a fantastic interaction with Brosnan.I'd recommend seeing this film, if you have seen the original I'd suggest trying not to make comparisons, if you haven't, enjoy. It's very clever, and yet slightly Hollywood. We all left the cinema agreeing that we'd had a thoroughly good night out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than the original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an absolutely fun remake of a good movie but why remake movies? Simple - In 31 years things have changed a lot in terms of movie skill and technology for the better.Sitting in my ultra comfy seat with my drink holder, hearing the sound track on a fantastic Sony Dynamic Digital Sound System, seeing fantastic footage and camera work on a huge screen, and watching Brosnan and Russo who were made for their roles smoothly cavort through this delightful romantic fantasy was my idea of movie heaven.Of course there was crass commercialism that came with the package. Where have people who complain about this been? Name a movie that doesn't have some kind of commercial in it these days - or maybe you think movie makers just randomly go to some car dealer to buy the cars they use. Don't people understand there are product placement people who make a living putting their clients' products in movies?Yes it is much more of a fantasy than the original, but I personally go to the movies to get away from the steady drum of media reality that pollutes our lives in this day and age.Escapism it is, and one of the best I've seen lately at doing its job! 10 stars!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a problem with the fact that Rene Russo's character was just SO much smarter than her male counterparts. Not in a macho way, just that they were all so dumb and whatever she said, was like, "Huh? Oh, okay." As if they had no brain of their own. I understand that she is one of the principal characters, but no one else did anything to help solve the case except this superwoman who never had to identify herself or be accountable to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacks the Original's Distinctive Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the original "Thomas Crown Affair" stood in roughly the same relationship to real-life crime as the James Bond films do to real-life espionage, the current 007 Pierce Brosnan was perhaps a natural choice to star as the new Thomas Crown. He brings to the role a similar combination of cool sophistication with a hint of toughness as Steve McQueen, the King of Cool, brought to the original. (I have always thought that McQueen would have made a great James Bond if the producers had ever felt they wanted an American in the role).The new film follows roughly the same plot as the 1968 version, with one or two minor variations. The setting is transferred from Boston to New York, and the millionaire tycoon Crown is British rather than American. The most significant change is that the robbery which Crown organises is not of money from a bank but rather of a priceless Monet painting from an art gallery. As in the original, he is pursued by an attractive female insurance company investigator with whom he becomes romantically and sexually entangled. As in the original, the trappings of Crown's millionaire lifestyle are much on display- his expensive cars, his exclusive New York residence (even more luxurious than was McQueen's), his private glider, his yacht. (In this version Crown is a yachtsman rather than a polo player, although he is still a golfer). Even the theme song "The Windmills of Your Mind" comes in at the end and Faye Dunaway makes a cameo appearance as Crown's psycho-analyst.Despite the similarities in plot, I felt that something was lacking compared with the original film. That film is one that you watch less for its plot than for its atmosphere of style and sophistication, the epitome of sixties cool. The remake never really captures this. To take an example, it dispenses with the famous game of chess during which McQueen is seduced by Faye Dunaway; instead the investigator (here called Catherine rather than Vicki) seduces Crown after they have been dancing together. To make a game as intellectual as chess sexy was quite an achievement on the part of the actors and director; it is much less of a challenge to do the same for dancing, an activity which has been described as the vertical expression of horizontal desires. The chess scene is memorable precisely because it is so unexpectedly erotic; the dancing scene is much more forgettable. The director John McTiernan dispenses with Norman Jewison's use of the split screen; that was probably the right decision, as that technique used today would probably have given the film a very dated feel, but McTiernan does not come up with anything equally distinctive to replace it. Pierce Brosnan is good as Crown, but I was less taken with Rene Russo's Catherine, who I felt (surprisingly for an actress who is a former model) lacked the sophisticated elegance of Faye Dunaway's Vicki.I make no apologies for comparing this film to the original version; film-makers who remake earlier movies are deliberately inviting such comparisons. It would be wrong to say that I disliked the newer version. In some respects it is superior to its predecessor; it has, for example, a more coherent plot. There are some humorous touches such as the scene where Catherine thinks she has recovered the missing painting, only to find that it is a fake painted over "Monet's unknown masterpiece- Dogs at Cards". There is also a neat twist at the end when Crown (helped by a number of accomplices, all identically dressed with bowler hats and briefcases) succeeds in replacing the painting on the walls of the gallery under the noses of Catherine and the police. Seen as a romance/comedy/thriller, the remake is not a bad film. It is, however, a routine one. The original was not a great film, but it was never routine. It had its own quite distinctive style and personality, something the remake lacks. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR, in my opinion, is an excellent action movie with a little romance thrown in that has excellent performances. If you ask me, Thomas (Pierce Brosnan) and Catherine (Rene Russo) made a cute couple. As far as I could see, they looked really good in the attire they wore to the ball. I just don't understand why he wanted to rip off a piece of artwork, though. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved in this project did an excellent job. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend excellent action movie with a little romance thrown in that has excellent performances to all you Pierce Brosnan or Rene Russo fans who haven't seen it.

		<shortDescription>OK remake of OK movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a long time since I saw the original, and, as far as a I remember it, this remake is about as good. It is different, but very much along the lines of the original. It's heresy to say this, but the "King of Cool", while being a charismatic movie star, wasn't a very convincing actor--to be honest, mostly a lot of squinting, scowling, and strutting mixed in with some open-faced innocence. McQueen had excellent taste in machinery though, which was reflected in many of his films and, as homage, is repeated here. This production has very high production values, but I thought Pierce Brosnan was way too smug and smarmy and not very likable, Rene Russo came off as a bit creepy, and the plot wasn't smooth and kind of stuttered along. Still it was OK and not a terrible waste of time or anything like that, and, as referenced earlier, being a remake of a Steve McQueen star vehicle, it had some nice stuff in it--a Bentley, racing day- sailing catamarans, a few other hot cars, and a sailplane. So, pretty much average movie, not bad, but not great either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Quick recommendation: Go see it. It's a great movie. It's fun. It's (in a good way) complicate. The main cast does a great job. The direction of John McTiernan is excellent....You wanna wish for more......but...that was back in 1999. Now 15 years later and the long awaited sequel (rumored to be called Topkapi at some point) is nowhere to be seen.Well there is a complicate explanation. Thomas Crown complicate. John McTiernan was accused with criminal charges and end up in prison. He fought for years in courts, so any future project of his got frozen. Brosnan said in 2009 that Paul Verhoeven was attached to direct the new film. Seems like a great choice to me to replace McTiernan but unfortunately he left because of creative differences.The good news are that a few months ago John McTiernan revealed he had written a script for the sequel whilst in prison, called Thomas Crown And The Missing Lioness!!! So there must be hope after all for a good sequel!In the meantime DON'T MISS this movie. It has everything, and the consensus is that is far better than the original..</fullReview>

On balance I enjoyed it especially the twist in the tale which was at variance with the original movie and although I don't feel that it is as good as the original (what sequel ever is) it sure made for an pleasant evenings entertainment. Given that to follow such a classic original as the one starring 'the king of cool himself', this company should be congratulated for a very good effort. Certainly worth watching and far better and slicker than other, more highly publicised thriller movies. Go with open mind and enjoy the show.</fullReview>

The chemistry between the two of them was kind of- lets see- um, boring? Although the robbery scenes were fairly entertaining and you get a few chuckles out of the scene with the Trojan horse, the point of the movie is hard to find and the movie is definitely not unique in the slightest. Its definitely not the first time we've come across a female detective who seems to only care about sleeping with the suspects of crimes she is investigating. By the time the ending arrives, you're not surprised by what happens and its more of a relief than anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thriller? No one under thirty? Surely not...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never saw the original. I have no idea whether or not Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway's chess scene was more erotically charged than Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo's more direct scene-on-the-stairs. I loved this film; I got my ?5.00's worth and I'm happy.It was just so good to see a tightly worked thriller with no-one under thirty in it; having recently seen 'Cruel Intentions' (ie Dangerous-Liasons-Lite with Sarah Michelle Gellar and hip young co-stars making a mess of a perfectly good story), it was good to see that McTiernan and Brosnan had obviously realised that to make a good remake you don't have to half the age of the cast. It was smart, sexy, had a couple of great twists and had my undivided attention from start to finish.Dennis Leary finally played the straight man I've always suspected he could, Rene Russo managed to convey pure sexuality without compromising the 'worthy adversary' aspects of her role, and Pierce... well, I didn't think it was possible for him to up the cool from his James Bond levels, but Thomas Crowne blows 007 out of the water. If you haven't seen this film, go and see it if you get the chance. If you've seen the original and want to tell me exactly why it's so much better than the original, feel free to do so. I maintain, however, that the most important thing is to leave the cinema happy, which I did. Whether or not this is a remake, it's a great movie.Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Half a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of the 1968 film is, during its first half, better than the original. It moves quickly, is well-directed and Brosnan and especially Russo are great. Cool sex scenes too. But halfway through Brosnan takes Russo to his island getaway (and I'm not giving anything away--it's in the coming attractions), and the movie falls apart. It still LOOKS good, but the story gets repititous, confusing, needlessly convoluted and downright boring. There's one good twist near the end but the very end is very insulting to the audience. The only thing that kept me watching during the second half is the excellent direction, great music score and (again) Brosnan and Russo. These two put to shame McQueen and Dunaway from the original (nice touch to have Dunaway play Crown's psychiatrist). Team them up together, hopefully with a better script.</fullReview>

As a 40-Something myself, attending grad school at a U.C. campus and thus surrounded by 20,000 19-22 year olds 24/7, I was comforted and gratified to see a movie that shamelessly portrays hot and desirable physical play and romance between to real life 40-Something actors. Yaay for us! And yaay to Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo. Further, the movie was also a finely tuned, exciting "caper flick." Sure, it may be implausible that a multi-jillionaire would swipe art; the ins and outs of the thefts are also a touch "over the top," but dang it, it's a MOVIE! If it was exactly like real life, I could stay home and watch myself. As it is, the whole thing was meticulously planned and executed-- a nice, satisfying work of art. It was exciting, playful-- very entertaining! And very nice for the pre-Viagra-but-paying attention-to-it-just-in-case-for-later crowd. I suspect that anyone of ANY age, even my 20-Something students and colleagues would also find it great fun. I rated this one a solid "10."</fullReview>

Brosnan and Russo are a clever casting choice at first glance, but John McTiernan's vulgar direction lacks every kind of style this sort of ironic caper stuff needs. It is either too dark or too deliberately tongue in cheek and as a whole therefore completely out of balance. In Mid-section Rene Russo performs whole scenes bare-breasted, which is absolutely unnecessary whereas Brosnan is still too stiff to be a remarkable leading man and far too James Bond to be believable as somebody seriously in conflict with emotional ballast. Denis Leary has the best moments in a surprisingly soft and moving part as police detective with a heart-breaking history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ah, to be filthy rich, and still feel the urge to steal...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pierce Brosnan plays Thomas Crown, one of the most smug rich guys you've ever seen in this romantic drama. I attended a sneak preview of The Thomas Crown Affair along with a sold-out crowd, and I'm not sure anyone really knew quite what to expect. I knew this was a remake, and that Pierce was gonna steal something, but aside from that the film was still a mystery to me. Turns out the plot is that rich boy Thomas, who happens to be an avid art collector, decides to steal a $100,000,000 Monet painting from a large New York museum. Although he gets away with it, an insurance investigator played by Rene Russo shows up to hunt down the missing piece, and quickly realizes that Mr. Crown is to blame. Now while she should be working with the New York cops, led here by Denis Leary of all people, she instead pursues Crown independently, and of course falls in love with him. A similar plot was tried earlier this year with the rather bland Entrapment. But where Connery fell flat, Brosnan excels, at least through the aspect of being convincing in his role. Russo also does a good job with her character, and sets a record for showing off her breasts in a film. Denis Leary on the other hand feels somewhat out of place, especially since he's not sporadically cussing and smoking like a chimney. While the events here are entertaining, some of the romantic scenes go on just a bit long, leaving us to wonder if everyone has forgotten all about why they're here to begin with. Unfortunately there aren't many surprises in this film, in fact you could probably guess the outcome of just about every scene. I long for the day when the female law enforcement officer actually arrests the man she's pursuing, at least it would make for a bit of a different story. I never saw the original, so I can't really compare the two, but for the most part I enjoyed this film, even if it made me realize just how far away I am from living the "good" life. While Brosnan's smug character doesn't offer many socially redeeming qualities, you can't help but want to live the way he does, even if just for a day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great caper movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a difficult experience with the 13th Warrior, director John McTiernan returns to his best form with this simple yet brilliantly entertaining romantically themed caper movie, that relies on the excellent interplay between the two main leads; some clever but simple dramatic set-pieces; clever dialogue; great chemistry between the actors, and stylishly photographed locations. This movie shows that the director can deliver a great film without resorting to action sequences or blowing things up!This film is a clever and contemporary remake of the 1968 Norman Jewison directed, Steve McQueen starrer, and brings the themes very effectively up to date for a modern audience. Brosnan is perfect in the role, and shows that he can play a charismatic leading man that is different from James Bond, but no less interesting or entertaining. Due to circumstances early on in the film, he is pursued by insurance investigator Catherine Banning, also an outstanding performance by the charismatic Rene Russo, who flaunts her sexuality as a weapon to distract Brosnan's Crown character with a view to getting him arrested. However, this quickly develops into an very evenly balanced cat and mouse game between the characters, as each tries to outwit the other, yet at the same time they are becoming romantically more and more involved, which does leads to a major confrontation about three quarters of the way into the movie. This then allows a very clever climax to play out. There are two enjoyably entertaining supporting roles. Dennis Leary and Frankie Faison are two down to earth and streetwise local detectives who work alongside Banning, and as the film goes on Leary's character, who starts off as a bit stereotypical, evolves cleverly into something more sophisticated, and ends up representing the most grown up and adult perspective on the chain of events that make up the film's plot.McTiernan's directing is clever, whether it's the opening and closing set pieces, dialogue scenes or a refreshing and stylish (but not gratuitous) take on sex scenes he melds this film together with real style, bearing in mind that this his first attempt at this genre, and shows his versatility as a director given the right material. Technical credits are all very good, but particular mention has to go to Tom Priestley's photography, which is stylish and with camera-work that has a very retro feel to it (steadicam and hand held cameras is almost entirely avoided in the film); John Wright's slick editing and Bill Conti's atmospheric score. In short a great movie that clearly shows that director McTiernan can handle non-action films with great aplomb given the right script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John McTiernan is famous for the hard hitting, action adventure films, so the remake of a Steve McQueen classic must have been a challenge. This is a different kinds of drama and suspense, based in the world of the very wealthy. Brosnan is up to the task, and perfectly portrays the well mannered, savvy businessman who is bored to death with the society crowd and craves something more from life. Rene Russo is the perfect foil for Crown, the driven, intelligent, and self confident woman who competes and excels in a man's world. Leary has his work cut out for him, bur rises to the occasion as the street detective who has to keep up with Russo, and is always one step behind. The flow of the film is more even than the original, and the photography and scenery is amazing, from the New York City shots to the island that serves as Crown's hideaway in the Caribbean. The homage of having Dunaway as the psychiatrist (She played the investigator in the original), and retaining the original theme (Windmills of Your Mind ? written for the original film and performed by Sting) bring an overall polish to the movie that make it one of the best. Nudity and some language make this a poor choice for the under 14 set, but most teens should be able to enjoy the film with a minimum of giggling and pointing. Definitely a collectible, and one to watch with the wife when the lights are low and the kids are in bed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick, glossy and cool ? just don't expect it to be a piece of art (sorry!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Businessman and billionaire Thomas Crown has everything he wants ? money is nothing to him. One side part of his life is stealing valuable works of art. In an elaborate set-up, Crown manages to steal a painting from a New York gallery without detection. However insurance investigator Catherine Banning suspects him and pursues him. Crown falls for her, realising the fun he can have with a worthy adversary. However as their relationship becomes more serious, Catherine also begins to close the web on Crown ? but which way will she go with him?I ignored this in the cinema due to fairly average reviews and likewise video didn't entice me. However free on terrestrial ? yeah, I'll take that! So I settled down to something that immediately set itself out to be fresh, slick and light with a jazzy credit sequence and a glossy (without being OTT) little robbery sequence. So far so good. The middle section is not quite all it could have been but it is still good. It does get a little heavy and slows the film down and the romance between the two leads doesn't quite wash at every turn, but they toy with each other well enough to keep the interest.The climax is pretty cool and clever and it is refreshing that the film never falls into big action set pieces to win over the audience ? instead keeping it glossy and slick throughout. It is quite something to find a thriller of sorts that is for grown ups and not teenage boys who NEED something to blow up every so often. The plot here is robust enough to meet the film's needs but is a little too slick to be examined too closely. But take this as what it is ? slick adult popcorn seller ? and you'll enjoy it. It is breezy and enjoyable.As Crown, Brosnan exudes charm and smoothness but also is able to put an edge on it to show that Crown is not happy even when he has the world. Russo gives a better performance than I've come to expect from her but is still a little out of place in the film. She isn't totally convincing and I became annoyed by the regular appearance of her tits in the film ? did it really help the film I wondered? Maybe once it was natural in the scene but the rest just seems like a cry for an audience. Leary does sterling work as Det McCann, although he isn't funny he is a strong serious actor and carries the role well. The support cast are all pretty good and Dunaway's cameo adds to the slick feeling rather than standing out awkwardly.Overall this film will please you if you know what to expect. If you want something wonderful or meaningful then this will let you down. However, if you're ready for a slick, glossy bit of entertainment that will engage without challenging then this should be more than enough to pass a wet Saturday afternoon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my all time favorite movies. I completely did not expect to like it (i rented it, and hadn't heard much about it before viewing it). The acting was flawless. The casting was superb (thank god they paired him with Rene Russo &amp; not Denise Richards!). Could Rene Russo be more beautiful/sexy? Ditto for Pierce Brosnan. The music was a perfect fit. The script was clever and unexpected. I can watch it a thousand times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I fell in love with the film the first time I saw it. What is there not to love? I enjoyed the chemistry between Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo, not to mention "bravo!" to the powers-that-be for the great casting. It about time more believable actors were cast for the part. If the age difference has been as significant as Catherine Zeta-Jones and Sean Connery (a former Bond in a similar type of role; much like Brosnan in a similar type of Bond-character), it would not have been as believable. Rene Russo is absolutely stunning in this film (Gotta love her wardrobe!). I enjoy watching this film multiple types, as will you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remakes and cover versions seem to be the done thing at present, even if there is no good reason for it, and there certainly isn't a good reason here. Strangely, in view of the changes in the social status of women since the original, the lead woman seems to have lost power and status since the original. Victoria Anderson was Thomas Crown's match, and some, but Catherine Banning just caves in at the first sniff of pheromones. I thought Pierce Brosnan was a little more attractive than Steve McQueen, but he is not such a good actor, and Rene Russo looked cheap, superficial and unattractive, and I really didn't care whether she got him or not. One was driven to ask what he wanted with her. There was too much unneeded sex, presumably to keep up excitement levels when the plot was flagging, and too much use of Crown's lavish lifestyle. Okay we knew he was a rich man, enough already! The ending sucks. An innocuous way to pass part of a Saturday evening and that's all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>See, the thing about the Thomas Crown Affair is that it doesn't have an explosion every five minutes. Neither does it include some seventeen-year-old girl whose sole purpose is to "entertain" the males in the audience. It is a film that requires you to pay attention, to think a little, and to actually enjoy the movie instead of picking holes in every stupid thing that comes along.I recently sat through the Beach - fine movie, but in the row behind me were a couple of adolescent losers who insisted on making whiny, derisive, pointless remarks for the duration of the film. I bet they didn't like TCA either.Pierce Brosnan shows that he can handle more than just Bond, and is more convincing in his role than Steve McQueen was. Sacrilege, I know, but McQueen never impressed as the bored billionaire.Rene Russo is a talented actress, and I was very grateful to see two actors of similar age involved in a relationship. This was one of the strongest areas of the movie - the love affair / cat-and-mouse hunt between Crown and Banning. This is the best reason to see the movie.The heists at the beginning and end of the film are also excellent (especially the latter) but if you are looking for non-stop action then go see something else instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the remake. . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film amazed me from the moment I saw the Greco-Asian horse being delivered to the Met. I enjoyed it so much that I rushed to the video store to rent the original, but was immensely disappointed. The characters in the original are flat and false. McQueen's Crown has no redeeming qualities and I am still at a loss trying to figure out why he would plan to rob a bank but not do it himself. Vicky Anderson, with her babydoll voice, is hardly believable as an insurance investigator (and the chess scene is barely viewable). It was boring. The 99 remake is a fast-paced and complex film that charms the viewer. Crown actually participates in the burglary, it's not only about the prize; it's about the rush of the action. Russo's Banning is a strong and vibrant woman and her incentive to catch the thief is completely believable. Without giving away too much, it was an absolute delight! The make-over certainly made the difference; this film is wonderful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brosnan and Russo do passable job in McQueen remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's always hard to tackle a remake, especially here in England when the original was shown on BBC TV a week before the remake opened at the cinema and while Entrapment - obviously this film by another name - was still on general release.However, taking all this into account the film makers have made a reasonable effort with this one.Brosnan is Bond, now and forever in the minds of many of the people in the cinema I saw this. You can see that the most famous of roles has had an effect on his acting style, but I thought he was good if a little unimaginitive at times.Russo was the star for me, impressing as she usually does, despite the gratuituous sex scenes with Brosnan on the stairs - debatably unnecessary to the plot, but they no doubt brought in the crowds - with her slick and stylish approach to a challenging role.Definitely worth seeing, if only because Brosnan and Russo is a far more likely combination than Connery and Zeta-Jones in Entrapment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original McQueen movie was terrific and this could never live up to it but they could have done better. Basically, they removed the wit and character from all the players and Russo seemed intent on trying to look a sex symbol instead of the mess she actually looks.Brossman is expressionless and dull and their perfunctory sex scenes were un-erotic tedium. If I want to watch sex I`ll watch a porno they should stick to the plot.The whole point of the original story was that they could not trust each other and Fay Dunnaway played this superbly in the orininal. Russo looked jaded and soul-less and just going through the motions.The ending was dreadful and not at all true to the story line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WOW! This is a fun tickler!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie! Every time I see it on TV, it reminds me that I should go out and buy this for my personal collection. I especially love Faye Dunaway's character as she unreservedly psychologically peels the main character. I prefer the current version to the original as the original revolved around a bank heist, which seems so much more vulgar than art theft. I believe the film was supposed to be based on Tomas Van Der Heijden and his thefts of the Renoirs from the Louvre in 1961 so I found a theft of a Monet in the remake to be more in accordance with the spirit of the original heist. Although, I must admit, the first film used the dune buggy that T. Heijden used to escape in was a fun bit of reference. This film is a bit slow on action but there are so many levels that the actual heist itself becomes just an undercurrent to the more interesting interpersonal relationships and the emotional complexity that manifests in the process. Superbly acted by the three main characters. This is an excellent cat and mouse movie; the best part is trying to decide who is the cat and who is the mouse! If you like a shoot 'em up, crash the car explosion fest, this movie will bore you, but if you like complex character driven movies, this one should tickle your fancy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been awhile since the release of this spectacular cinematic effort. I own the DVD and find myself returning to it often enough. I'm not an incureable romantic, far from it. I'm an observer of life, and this film has a slice of life rarely captured or portrayed adequately...... I'm referring to Thomas Crown himself. Too often we see the baubles and toys of the rich, famous and powerful. They're detailed endlessly on superficial, tightly edited shows that air on television every night. We never see the person behind the toys and what really makes them what they are. In The Thomas Crown Affair, Pierce B. took a little suave from Bond, but added that certain air of confidence and assurance we see in the upper crust of achievers in our society. We're privy to witness that extra drive and risk-taking behaviour the top rung share; while the rest of us clap as the parade goes by. Give McTiernan credit. Those subtle nuances of Brosnan betting huge $$$ for a golf shot, that tremendous splash as he races the catamaran to a wet end, as well as Crown's open friction and flirtation with authority. Pure genius. This film is a five-star effort from stem to stern; but it really is an eye-opening experience for the 95% of the populace content to just eat, breathe and sleep. It shows us the real difference between the rich and powerful and the wannabees.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thomas Crown Affair is a totally superfluous remake of an earlier Norman Jewison film (which by the way I have never seen).The story is good, although it is clearly a Bond spinoff (which at the time of the original were still "en vogue"). After a while the anachronism sets in as you start to miss the whisky glasses and sixties cars and the appropriate hairdoes.Crown (Pierce Brosnan, also producer) is a very successful broker of sorts (he has a huge metal-and-glass building full of well-dressed people bowing and clicking heels whenever he decides to show up between the yachting and lovemaking) who steals works of art. It is clear he chooses crime not for want of money but purely for the adrenalin.And that is precisely where this film falls short. Never at any time do you get that feeling of luxury combined with tension, of elegant crime perpetrated in grand manner. For two hours you see a larger version of a glossy magazine, with Brosnan and Russo as cardboard figures with toothpaste smiles, doing what is probably the most expensive ad campaign to date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Movie Alert!! AOOOGAH! AOOOGAH!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a heist movie. So they claim. All the adverts show Pierce Brosnan nabbing off with works of art, and then being chased by Rene Russo in a cat-and-mouse game of nerves. The adverts LIE!!!To be fair there are two robberies in this film, one at the very beginning which is "quite clever" and one at the end which is "very clever". Neither of them are clever enough to warrant suffering through the rest of this AWFUL film however.You see, Thomas Crown is a billionaire businessman who is BORED. Poor lamb. So he gets his fun by stealing paintings. Rene Russo is also BORED. She enjoys chasing Crown because he's a challenge. He enjoys her for the same reason. And both of them are very BORED and very CLEVER and very IRRITATING.The most part of this movie then, is taken up with a romance between these self-involved, mindless, hedonistic characters. And frankly I couldn't wait for Dennis Leary (playing the cop) to catch them both and send them to Texas for a lethal injection.At one point in the movie Rene Russo throws a Renoir on a fire and the both of them look on like this is a fine old joke. Now I know it's just a movie, and I shouldn't take it seriously but this is not the sort of action that makes me LIKE a character. This just makes me want to get right up there on the screen with them and bang their heads together.Sorry for being so crabby. But this film sucked. And I want the two hours of my life I wasted on it BACK.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had not seen the previews but, had heard about it. Brosnan's role sounded good, really good, so I went with my wife and a friend and we saw it one evening. This movie, was quite a wondrously detailed beautiful painting, emotionally enticing with sophisticated adventure. Truly I can say, it sparkled. This film was like enjoying a fine and expensive dinner with a nice bottle of wine. This just totally satisfied us. I noticed from early on, that the soundtrack was very alluring, almost sensual in nature. The musical artist 'Sting' performed the 1968 title track from the original film. Now remade with a stunning grace. Then at times the music kicks it up a notch and goes into an action mode. We really didn't stop talking about it for quite a while. The characters from, Catherine Banning (Russo) and 'Det. McCann' (Leary) and (Frankie Faison as) ' Det. Peretti' and of course Pierce Brosnan as the lead 'player' Thomas or 'Tommy' as friend to be Catherine would call him. But from an interview that I saw, truly I am of the same opinion that Denis Leary is when he said,"I'm a big fan of Steve McQueen, but I think he was just miscast in the roll of Thomas Crown. I liked this remake a lot more than the original in 68." From the art galleries to Manhattan, the beautiful twin towers and all the city lights, where a tremendous addition to this 'platinum story' directed by John McTeirnan of 'Die Hard' I &amp; III and 'Preditor' etc. was one of those, have to be seen again and then down the line again, movies that just reminds you of style, travel, romance and all centered around Manhattan. This was a truly delicious tale of passion, an art lover, a business baron ...with a magician's talent for the sleight of hand, with a love's twist of fate. This is a movie for couples that I believe truly satisfies romantic cinematic cravings, for a beautiful story and a wonderful ending. I can see this again and again and fall in love with it every time. (*****)</fullReview>

And of course, New York, premium backdrop to the sassiest flicks.It works out as a romantic thriller with a painfully attractive loss adjuster/investigator of Rene Russo opposite the sharp-suited multi-national owner-who-has-everything Crown (Brosnan). The action is occasionally interspersed with therapy sessions for Crown as if to stress the mind games that Crown needs to enjoin in order to spice his life or sustain a relationship - these are rather clumsy interpolations in order to give Faye Dunaway a cameo in deference to her appearance in the (inferior and dull) 1968 original opposite Steve McQueen.Russo and Brosnan make it all worthwhile with some spirited if not totally convincing characterisations, all kept in reality check by Denis O'Leary's moral but moochy cop. It's funny, sexy, dreamy, ephemeral fluff which you'd be mad not to enjoy and boring to take any more seriously. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having spent two hours yetserday evening watching this film on Satellite TV, the only positive feeling that I had was that at least I hadn't spent money renting the DVD, or even worse purchasing it. Although the film is beautifully shot, it lacks a certain element - namely believability.From the moment of the robbery, which is full of inconsistencies, to the point where the insurance investigator decides that Crown is the thief (for no other reason that I could see but it was the only way the scripters could manage to move what remained of the plot forward) right up to the ending the film is laughably inept.As an attempt to make a 'sophisticated' film it failed simply because it treated its audience like morons. Sophistication has to fail when the audience spends half the time wondering where on earth they managed to find a judge to sign a search warrant against one of the richest men in New York on no evidence at all, or why the police didn't arrest the insurance investigator after discovering her illegal activities.The obligatory sex scenes were equally laughable - making love on a marble staircase has to be the most uncomfortable experience ever (I do not speak from personal knowledge).Apart from some good camera work this film has nothing to recommend it and must rank as one of the worst films it has ever been my misfortune to see.This is a definite not-to-see.</fullReview>

Someone wrote here this movie has good dialogue: well, I found it unbelievable and one of many things that detaches this from being a real movie, both for Russo and for Brosnan. The acting is average for Brosnan, but will he ever stop playing that character? You don't need a crystal ball to foresee typecasting. Russo's acting is very, perhaps also due to a character that makes no sense, at least in this script. If they really tried to give it irony it was too gross for this type or movie, and maybe her character could make sense in a different story, some sort of b-movie. But the two major flaws of this movie are the endless sporting sequences and the ending. I won't go into spoilers here, but these two features makes you think the makers had little to say and lots of film to waste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wrong title - This is not a remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "Thomas Crown Affair" showed a cool and disciplined Steve McQueen, a seductive and self-controlled Faye Dunaway and - very important - a really cleverly and well-planned crime. The Story is really like a game of chess, and the dilemma of Faye to choose between love and business is climaxing in the end. Every part of that film could be true.The new film shows nothing of all that. It could be called a "nice film" if they only had not tried a "remake". Pierce Brosnan is playing a rich loser, who gives away 100.000s of bucks for dull bets. And no real lover of art would handle paintings like he does. Rene Russo always seems to be drunk and remote-controlled. Unfortunately even Faye Dunaway accepted a role in this film - as if that could justify this catastrophe. In the end you are feeling cheated - how can all people be so dumb: if only guards would accept wrong deliveries, if only art experts would not recognize water colors instead of oil, if only detectives would follow every step you take but not after obviously your lover committed a crime (and you will run to him), if only monitoring systems would be at the level of the 1950s... anybody could easily become a criminal like Thomas Crown.Very disappointed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this to be a pretty solid re-make of the Steve McQueen-Faye Dunaway film of the early '70s. Actually, a lot of people thought this version was a lot more interesting and entertaining.This '99 re-make was more of a thinking man's crime movie that one normally sees these days in which violence and profanity are way overdone so many times. However, this movie is far from family entertainment with amoral lead actors including Rene Russo baring her breasts a few times and Pierce Brosnan having sex with her at first opportunity.Speaking of morals, one gets tired of the film world constantly making the criminals the good guy and the police as someone to root against. That mentality is so Liberal it's sickening and those messages abound in this story. Neither of the two leads has an ounce of integrity....but we are manipulated into rooting for them.For nostalgia buffs, the let Dunaway play a small role in here, as the annoying psychiatrist.I really liked this film the first two times I saw but was totally turned off at the third viewing. Maybe my conscience was slow to kick in, as this movie is clever story- wise but sick message-wise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the remake and the original back to back for the first time, so this review is more about whether you should watch the original or the remake.Both movies involve a heist, a love connection and a police investigation. However most of the details are quite different in the two movies, and they almost stand alone.The heist:The heist in the remake is much more interesting, detailed, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The original's heist is straightforward and there are no surprises. It is just a plot device in the original, whereas in the remake it is very well done. The item being stolen makes more sense and really helps the story in the remake.The love connection:The remake does not just rely on the two main characters to create intrigue. The original spends most of it's time on this. To me it is quantity over quality. If you prefer the classic 1960s actors gazing at each other communicating via body language instead of dialogue, you may prefer the original. I prefer the remake.The police investigation:The remake has additional side plots which make it much more interesting. The original is very straightforward, there is an edge of your seat moment or two, but they are not as well done. The way the driver is caught is just wrong and unbelievable, not clever. The remake is far more interesting and well done.ConclusionThe remake is more interesting and contains much more action. The original is more of a drama about two people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So it's not high art, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The performances given by Mr. James Bond himself, Pierce Brosnan and by Rene Russo were perfect for this movie. The plot of the original movie has been given a total makeover. Whereas in the original 1968 version, Steve McQueen organized a $2 million bank robbery, in a very 60's blow against the system, Brosnan pulls off an art robbery single handed, walking out a museum with a Monet painting worth fifty times the amount. However, the essence of the original movie has been retained, and revolves around a tough-nosed female insurance investigator conducting an ambiguous love affair (Rene Russo) with millionaire playboy Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan), whilst at the same time trying to trap her seemingly uncatchable quarry.The script by Kurt Wimmer and Leslie Dixon is very good and there is really never a boring part in it. The script develops the characters well and the heist scene in the art museum was really well done. The photography is great so is the jazzy music from Composer Bill Conti. Oh you can't forget the small but funny role by Faye Dunaway who was in the original. Rent this or do what ever to see it. because it has great chemistry between Brosnan and Russo and what is really great is that they are about the same age. But what is the stand out i think is John McTiernan who shows that he can direct other films than just action.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This "Thomas Crown Affair" has its moments, but it's also easily forgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should probably start my review for the 1999 version of "The Thomas Crown Affair" by confessing that I didn't see the original 1968 version starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway. I mention this for the sake of informing my readers that no comparisons between the remake and the original will be made here, even though I do know that another version exists. With that being said, I honestly think that while the 1999 version of "The Thomas Crown Affair", starring Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo, does offer two hours of pure escapism to the audience, it suffers significantly from the fact that it is straight up forgettable. In "The Thomas Crown Affair", we follow a wealthy businessman by the name of Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) who feels bored and is looking for a little challenge in his life whether it would be betting on a golf putt or racing on a catamaran. One day, he constructs a heist to steal a highly valuable painting from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Enter investigator Catherine Banning (Rene Russo) and Detective Michael McCann (Denis Leary) to try and solve his crime. When Catherine catches on quickly that Mr. Crown committed the crime, a game of cat-and-mouse ensues between the two as they fall in love with each other. Now, she must decide whether to turn him in or become his wife. As you can tell, this is the kind of fluffy plot that a great director like Alfred Hitchcock would have had the pleasure of handling. Amongst the positive aspects of this picture, I liked the heist at the beginning of the film in terms of its execution and the way it unraveled itself. I thought Rene Russo in general was physically attractive in this picture, and the performances from Pierce Brosnan and Denis Leary are alright. Aside from that, there really isn't much to talk about with a film like this. It just basically does what it was created to do and that's pretty much it. Because this film is so fluffy and mechanical, it offers very little that would be memorable a week from when it was last watched. Basically, about 90% of this picture has been erased from my memory it leaves so little an impact. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy fluffy entertainment as much as the next fellow. All I'm saying is that if you're going to make quality Saturday matin宓 entertainment, don't be afraid to do your best at making it a memorable enough experience. Give me quality storytelling that's focused and always engrossing, give me an interesting romance that feels real, and make sure the characters actually contribute to the main plot. Instead, this film provides us with a story that has decent potential at the beginning, but then slowly goes downhill as it progresses. I didn't think the chemistry between Brosnan and Russo was that great since I thought they felt too routine and familiar. Additionally, I felt that I didn't really get to know about any of the characters save for Denis Leary's, who does have a good bit at the end about what he really thinks of his current occupation. That's Faye Dunaway as Thomas Crown's psychiatrist, and you could say it's interesting to note that she decided to star in both versions of the same film. Having said that, I thought there was no reason why the scenes with the psychiatrist were needed because those scenes didn't contribute to the plot in any way. There are a few other scenes like this in which I didn't know what was supposed to be accomplished from them. Between that and the lackluster chemistry, this film could have benefited greatly from better story editing. In the end, I think "The Thomas Crown Affair", for all the complaints I've just made about it, is an ideal example of a film that's perfect for rental. It's one of those films that are basically a mixed bag that contains both things to like and dislike. It's good for rental since you can skip over the parts you don't really care about and fast forward to whatever it is you like from it, but just don't consider this film a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thomas Crown Affair ? Stealing high stake loot for fun, then seducing your opponent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thomas Crown Affair is an impossibly rich man stealing an extremely valuable painting with an elaborate scheme. It's your typical gentleman heist story, but with a sexy hard ass insurance investigator romance, and a sensible slightly overreacting cop. It's fun, exciting, surprising, and peppered with action.Good acting, especially on the part of Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo, and Denis Leary. Rich settings, interesting dialogs, captivating story, and nice stimulating score.There's a few small logical flaws in the scenario, but they are easily overlooked.It's good entertainment, watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant And Stylish Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thomas Crown Affair is a heist film that features Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo and Denis Leary.It is a remake of the 1968 film of the same title.It was directed by John McTiernan.When a priceless Monet painting is stolen from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the police find themselves wondering which world-class art thief pulled the job. What they don't know is that the thief wasn't a professional, but an amateur. Thomas Crown was born poor but made his way through Oxford on a boxing scholarship. With his sharp sense for business and ruthless ambition, Crown has become a self-made billionaire; but despite his wealth and power, he still seeks new challenges, and he steals art not for the profits but for the sheer excitement. However, as fun as art theft might be, it's still illegal, and investigator Catherine Banning is brought in to track down the culprit. Certain clues point to Crown, so Banning introduces herself into Crown's social circle. Police detective Michael McCann warns Banning against getting too close to Crown. She takes McCann's suggestion lightly.But she finds herself falling for the suave thief.For the Hollywood remake rule, which dictates that an update of an older film be inferior to the original in almost every aspect, The Thomas Crown Affair stands as a glorious exception. The original 1968 film was a diverting pop confection of mod clothes and nifty break-ins, but not much more. McTiernan's new version, though, cranks up the entertainment factor to mach speed, turning what was a languid flick into a high- adrenaline caper romance. Overall,it was a brilliant and stylish remake with interesting plot twists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romantic remake lacks bite of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fairly enjoyable remake gets off to a shaky start but gets better as it goes along. The intercutting and music at the outset were off-putting and by the numbers.In this version, Thomas Crown ends up in the arms of the woman investigator pursuing him or vice versa. Consequently, he is softer throughout and the story becomes more of a love story. She, in turn, develops more of a love interest in him that challenges her ability to pursue him for his theft.At the outset, her character is clich卜. It's the usual superior woman that is one of the types that Hollywood likes to promote. But then she gradually gives in to Crown's sincerity and charms.He needed challenge. She challenged him. They met their match. They get together. He wooed her and had much to woo her with materially. There was one rather silly and overdone dance scene in which she goes quite wild. Underneath it all were two lonely career people who needed mates.This of course is a far cry from the original McQueen-Dunaway characters, but that is the nature of the re-telling. It is not a pure imitation but a departure in another direction.I felt that the characters ended up being rather one-dimensional. There was not much in the way of developing deep conflicts or serious moral issues. Rather, the whole affair was more a light-hearted romantic triangle between man,woman and stolen painting that required resolution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thomas Crown Affair is a slick remake or the Newman original. There are a few serious flaws. First of all: The sound-track is one of the worst sound-tracks I've heard in a long time. Every time I hear the Jazzy score I cover my ears and cower. This flaw almost ruins the movie. The second flaw, more minor...and even a pleasure to some people, is the abundance of sex scenes in this movie.Now, if I remember right, there are two or three sex scenes, but they never end. I think the script writers lengthened the sex scenes when the movie came out too short in length. Anyway, worth seeing once, but I recommend the frequent use of the mute button.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sherlock Holmes caper with blazing sexual simmer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a rewrite and remake of the 1968 Steve McQueen venue, this rewrite/remake modernizes the general theme with entirely different capers, bringing up the product by a whole 2 points of 10. The tongue-in-cheek humor, innuendo and subtle humor abound, making this a great movie for the reasonably well college educated person. However, the classiness of the humor will surely be lost on the uneducated. The caper is, however, well enough revealed for the average man. This is a great date flick for the less sexually squeamish with the flirtatiousness of sexual innuendo moving to a subtle slow burn, followed by a full blaze, causing this to be uncomfortable for couples not fully involved, but encouraging the couple to become fully involved. The chemistry between the leads is so strong that it cannot be missed by anyone. So, this is not a good flick for couples who don't want to go there. The capers involve Sherlockian imagination and intelligence with wonderful twists. The final caper is a wonderfully imaginative romp to music, reminding me a bit of a more classy type of Monty Python humor, and shouldn't be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was unbelievably good. A genuine caper which I have not seen in a long time. I cannot believe it took me 11 years to see it! There are plot twists and the movie has style. The heists are especially good and thanks to the reviewer for posting the name of the song "Sinner Man" as was played during one heist.There is genuine chemistry between Brosnan and Russo which makes this movie especially compelling- especially Russo's vulnerability when she fears a younger woman. Brosnan is impeccably dressed and comes across as an intelligent handsome lover with style (the inside of his home will just make you melt if you are an art lover!). It would have been easy for the writers to slip and make him into a spoiled rich playboy-- but the movie has far more depth than that.Really wonderful- I am in my late 30s and don't think I would have appreciated it as much in my 20s - for whatever reason. Wonderful acting by all and a great story!</fullReview>

Every scene has a unique vibe to it that it allows the viewer to just experience the movie with enhanced feelings. 4) Ending could not get any better.

		<shortDescription>The Thomas Crown Affair (1999)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Wanna see it?""No.""Sure?"This is the remake of the classic 1968 original, with Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway. And because it is a remake it squarely divides people into three categories: those who loved the original, those who hated it and those who never saw it.Just like the original, the updated version is a mix of heist movie, cop thriller and romance. It has good directing, a very good cast, an excellent script and good music.Director John McTiernan does a great job. The shots are outstanding, the framing is excellent, the lighting and the positioning of the actors is very good. The moments that require the characters to be deep and thoughtful and interesting are very well done, featuring the director's trademark of cutting actor's faces just below the hairline, a shot that he seems to enjoy very much. A shot that if done right works magic. The passion for carefully framing the shots is a trait he shares with Norman Jewison, the director of the original. Unfortunately, both directors tend to abuse this kind of shots and they rarely and reluctantly let the camera show more than a very tight angle, which practically ruins every single shot that involves high speed action. And this is why I think McTiernan's "Rollerball" - the other remake based on Norman Jewison's work - was such a failure.The cast is very good. Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo have powerful performances as leads, and Denis Leary has a very good supporting role. Brosnan does a very believable playboy and when compared with McQueen he holds his ground well. His character is a little more sophisticated than the original, and that has been attributed to his days as James Bond. I think the simple truth is that this type of role fits him like a glove. Rene Russo's character is far better and far more believable than that of Faye Dunaway, her maturity working much better for the role of the sophisticated man hunter. Plus her character has a lot more to do and a lot more dept. Leary is great as a balancing counterweight for the pair, even if his character has much less to do than the original. Nonetheless, he is given ample chance to build and develop and that works very well. Faye Dunaway has a tiny role, in recognition of her work in the 1968 version.The script is far superior to the original and it manages to keep the viewer interested and entertained for the duration, trimming out some of the boring or awkward parts. Nevertheless, there are small passages that are taken from the original, shot for shot, word for word. The parts the two leads play require them to display more passion, to generate more tension and generally show a much broader range of emotion, which makes their story heartwarming and endearing. Were the first movie started strong but then went to sleep, the remake manages to keep going strong, even if it lags somewhat after the introduction. One strong point of the remake was how it dealt with the changes in technology and economic realities. A weaker point would be the problems with script believability, an area where it plays fast and loose but that's OK, because so did the original. The game of chess in the first movie was replaced by a much more sophisticated game of cat and mouse, and the movie is not shy about showing all the thrills, tension, fun and emotion that go with it.The music is good and it complements the action well. It is as much a character as it was in the first movie, only a lot less loud. It could be said that the music and some of the long sequences of empty space in the middle could have been cut down a little, but they stop short of becoming long and boring. Plus they are visually beautiful.The Thomas Crown Affair. A very good remake, that still keeps a lot of the original. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rule number one: Don't get caught</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arguably better than the Norman Jewison film it is derived from, definitely director John McTiernan's last watchable film, "The Thomas Crowne Affair" stars Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo as a couple of thrill-seekers on either side of the law. He steals paintings, she chases crooks. Pretty soon they're naked and in each other's arms.The film is all style, bouncing from sex, to seduction, to smoothly choreographed heist scenes. When we're not watching Pierce and Rene shamelessly flirting, we're getting high off watching Pierce's character get high off the wealth and power he exudes. He's suave, debonair and perpetually nonchalant.McTiernan adopts an equally slick, relaxed tone, complemented well by a jazzy score by the legendary Bill Conti. Standout scenes include Pierce taking Rene on a date in a Schempp-Hirth Duo Discus glider. I bet Steve Mcqueen, who starred in Jewison's 1968 film, is jealous.This genre's grand-daddy is Alfred Hitchcock's "To Catch a Thief", another ultra-lavish film which invites its audience to salivate over wealth, power and cutesy transgressions. McTiernan would be arrested for wire-tapping in early 2006.8/10 ? Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable Chick-Flick But Pales to the Original of 1968: McQueen vs Brosnan is an unfair match</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes the actor makes the movie, and such was the case with the original Thomas Crown Affair of 1968. Steve McQueen was and may still be the unrivaled king of the enigmatic male persona on film. In the original I doubt if McQueen said 15 lines; probably closer to 9 which is what made the original so compelling. You never quite get a sense of who McQueen is, even at the very end. This 1999 remake is certainly enjoyable but I don't know if I was quite sold on the idea of Brosnan as Thomas Crown. Crown is supposed to have both the extra-sensory intelligence and the amoral sensibility to pull off heists in ways which make the Gardner Heist of 1990 seem like it was pulled off by drug-store shoplifters. McQueen in 1968 definitely did. Did Brosnan? Maybe not quite. Despite Brosnan, the ending here is much softer than the original, although there is a kind of "bait and switch" which does work very well and saves the movie.The initial heist is a brilliant piece of workmanship, somewhat akin to the original movie in which the team of perpetrators are all unknown to each other. A famous Monet is stolen from the NY Metropolitan Museum, and the real mystery is how easily the theft was enacted like a 2-year old stealing a cookie from the cookie jar. Alas, we should remember this is a movie after-all. We know pretty early that Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) ended up with the cookie--a $100 million dollar cookie. (Earlier in the scene, some grade schoolers are being shown the painting by their school teacher who can't get them interested until she reveals to them how much it's worth. Somehow very American as the price of something is even more intriguing than the thing itself.) Rene Russo is the art investigator, essentially the equivalent character from the original played by Faye Dunaway, although here she's Catherine instead of Vicky. (Faye Dunaway plays a small part as Crown's nameless psychiatrist.) Russo decides before they've even gotten all the fingerprints that Brosnan is ultimately responsible for the absent Monet by looking at some art auction records and seeing him attempt a death-defying feat at sea. This quick deduction seemed forced as if the script wants to get to the affair as quickly as possible, and I wasn't quite buying into it. Maybe I wanted her to investigate a little more slowly than jumping to a conclusion, like most art investigators. The "affair" begins with Russo and Brosnan engaging in a relationship in which Russo can't decide whether she's pursuing the painting and its thief or pursuing a relationship, which is the same quandary of the original film.As stated earlier, buying into Pierce Brosnan in the role of Crown was a little problematic. He comes off as too much "Mr Nice Guy" to really believe he enacts such a selfish crime. For that matter, he's supposed to be a ruthless financial businessman, buying stock options and other securities for millions less than other competitive buyers. He almost seems too polite and well-mannered to believe he's simply a better-looking Donald Trump type. McQueen for some reason hit it on the money as a kind of well-dressed cookie monster in which millions of dollars are the chocolate chips. Brosnan seems more akin to someone running for student body president, someone who would never dream of getting into the cookie jar without permission. One aspect which makes the original different from the remake is that there is more revealed about the thieves and how they met with their "employer". Hardly any reference is made about about the theft itself once the "affair" gets going.Despite some of its shortcomings, particularly overlong love sequences, replete with lush melodic saxophones, the remake of the Thomas Crown Affair is still largely enjoyable. The twist at the end is quite interesting, and some pieces of the puzzle fall into place. It's good escapist fun, certainly not a masterpiece by any stretch. If you have the option of having an affair versus killing two hours watching this movie, I think you know which one will probably taste better. In several years, I will probably see the original Thomas Crown Affair again. Will I see the remake? Well, don't bet your chocolate chips on it.</fullReview>

Clever, witty story and dialogue, with Pierce Brosnan right on target as a rich, high-rolling businessman turned art thief. Rene Russo is hot, hot, hot, as the insurance investigator out to catch him. With all this though, the movie seemed like the cinematic equivalent of Chinese food; a half-hour later you're hungry again. Or in this case can't quite remember what you just saw. I keep getting this movie mixed up with the other recent caper flick with Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones that suffers from a similar problem. Lack of depth sufficient to raise the movie from the category of just a decent popcorn rental. And that's all it is. I grade it B-.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this version of "The Thomas Crown Affair" before renting the McQueen/Dunaway version. Having seen them both now I can say honestly that I find the remake [surprisingly] superior to the original. As a big fan of Steve McQueen, and as an even bigger fan of nuanced caper flicks of the late 60's / 70's, I have to admit I was flummoxed by my own conclusion here. But so be it. I found the original a bit uneven, a bit tedious--and the relationship between McQueen and Dunaway frankly wasn't as interesting as the Russo/Brosnan coupling, though ordinarily I'm not a huge fan of either actor. The cat and mouse game between the two is nicely orchestrated, and the action is frenetic and slick. The film has a nice visual feel to it, as well--sleek and classy.Not sure Dennis Leary's character added a whole lot to the proceedings (and I usually like him), but overall the film makes for an enjoyable evening's viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Admittedly, this is a loose remake, which usually spells trouble. To take an example, Never Say Never Again (the remake of Thunderball) was a flop, with plenty of cheese and terrible script. It ridiculed those who were in it. But, hoorayhoorah, this is one of the best thrillers I have seen for a while. And what a feast! 3 fantastic actors in the main roles (Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo and Denis Leary), brilliant script, and some of the most impressive scenes to be found amongst all the many crap pictures they seem to be reeling off at the moment. The teasing, cat-and-mouse chemistry between Russo and Brosnan is quite noticeable: she constantly playing games with him, he overly confident that he can get what he wants. Brosnan is a natural, it seems, at playing rich men (see James Bond, Grey Owl, The Tailor of Panama), but he has a certain vulnerability and sensibility which makes him a fantastic man to watch. The most amazing scenes in the film are those in the museum: the way he uses the other robbery to his advantage and makes a ten-second job of stealing the Monet; and the final scene in which he uses 6 different men all in the same attire to completely baffle the police as to his whereabouts. Both will have you grinning like an absolute imbecile!! it's an excellent film, but if you are looking for guns, death and explosions, stay firmly away: you won't find it here.</fullReview>

Not to forget Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo - what a great couple! I kept my breath during the dancing sequence. This is what I call CHEMISTRY! It압 pure MAGIC! In its style "The Thomas Crown affair" reminded me of genre classics like "Out of sight" or "Tequila sunrise" - they belong to my favorites!

Thomas Crown is a thrill-seeking, business-man, billionaire. He is very intelligent and loves to win. Catherine Banning is an insurance investigator who is also very intelligent and loves adventure as much as Thomas Crown does. Thomas Crown has stolen a Monet painting from a high security museum, and Catherine Banning is after him. In the process of the investigation, Thomas and Catherine fall in love. In this movie the hero, Thomas Crown, is seen as the good guy is watchers are sympathetic towards him. This is backwards from most stories and movies where the audience is rooting for the good guy. Thomas Crown is a thief, and already is a billionaire. The audience shouldn't like him. But everyone watching the movie wants him to get away with his crime.Thomas Crown's character in the movie is revealed through indirect presentation. We are not told outright his personality, but see it throughout the movie in the things he says and his reactions. His character is consistent throughout the movie and never changes. Thomas Crown is motivated in the actions he does, and most often, plans them out carefully. He is complex and many-sided, a round character. He doesn't change at all throughout the movie, so he is a static character. Catherine Banning's character is also revealed through indirect presentation. She also has consistent behavior throughout the movie until near the end, when her love for Thomas Crown causes her not to turn him in to the police and instead run away with him. She is also a round character, complex and many-sided. Even though she changed a little in the movie, I would still consider her a static, not developing character.These two characters in The Thomas Crown Affair are very similar in many ways in that they are revealed by indirect presentation and they are round and static characters. Both characters are believable in their roles. I enjoy watching this movie and have seen it several times</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people will like this film because it is slick, and others will hate it for the same reason. I was impressed at how gutsy this film was. It's not often in this day and age when we have a film which focuses on the chemistry between the main players, and weaves the action around it. It doesn't cut right to the chase, and it slowly builds. I liked that. I'm sure others may have walked out in boredom, but I assume they are a younger audience who wanted some shootings or explosions. Brosnan once again shows why he is the king of British coolness, while Russo plays his romantic foil to perfection. Also, big kudos go out to Denis Leary for showing the acting chops we all know he has beneath the angry guy exterior.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sexy movie worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like the original Thomas Crown Affair (the erotic chess scene is one of the best film scenes of the 60s). The remake is different but also very enjoyable. Brosnan and Russo have chemistry, their affair is intellectual, challenging and sexy. (Although most of the nude scenes are shot in the dark, some people here complain about the nudity and call it pornographic, which gives them away as bible belt purists, who do not know what they are talking about. There is more naked flesh in every James Bond.) But the movie does not need the overtly erotic scenes to carry its message (in fact I saw the absolutely flesh free airline version prior to the uncut version).Russo has the sex appeal of a mature woman, who knows exactly what she wants. To match Brosnan with her, instead of a twentysomething blonde bimbo, shows how important her role in the movie is, and is mandatory for us to believe why Thomas Crown is ready to give everything up for her. He could have any bimbo he wants, but that is not what he is after. He wants a soul mate, not a brainless doll.SPOILER ALERT ON: There are some unexplainable parts in the plot (how on earth does the Monet fit into the much smaller briefcase without folding it? How can you paint with WATERCOLOUR over an OIL PAINTING. The paint does not stick to the canvas and the messy result would never fool the experts of the museum. How did he steel the second picture?) SPOILER OFFAll this doesn't really matter. The remake is an immensely enjoyable film for a somewhat sophisticated audience, old enough to remember the original and young enough to appreciate a well made love story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plenty Of Sparks Between Brosnan And Russo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wealthy businessman with an eye for art meets his match in the clever and romantic, suspenseful, `The Thomas Crown Affair,' directed by John McTiernan. Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) stages an intricately planned heist of an art museum, and successfully makes off with a Monet worth millions. Enter the insurance investigator, the crafty Catherine Banning (Rene Russo), and the game is on. While detective Michael McCann (Denis Leary) follows the bread-crumb trail left for him by Crown, Banning sees through it immediately, and zeros in on Crown from the beginning. But how to nail him? Therein lies the heart of the story, as Banning goes right to it. She tells Crown that she knows he did it; Crown responds by taking her to dinner, then proceeds to court her, without ever admitting or denying her allegations. Then it's head to head, as they each vie for the pole position, and the sparks begin to fly. McTiernan shows some style here as he leads his stars through their interlude of discovery. He wisely avoids any showy displays and lets the tightly wound suspense of the story play out through the charismatic performances of Brosnan and Russo. Brosnan fits the part of Crown perfectly; there are shades of Bond, perhaps, and even a bit of `Remington Steele here,' but he makes Crown his own man, a separate entity which he plays with aplomb. Russo has never been better, nor looked better, and makes Banning a force to be reckoned with; there's a worldly sophistication to her, an intelligent confidence that lets you know there's something always cooking beneath the surface. The chemistry between the two sizzles, and how refreshing it is to see romance develop between two mature adults, as opposed to the more prevalent screen pairings Hollywood usually has to offer (Connery and Zeta-Jones in `Entrapment,' for example); it lends credibility to the story and makes the proceedings all that more interesting. There's some memorable scenes here, especially the initial caper, when Crown purloins the Monet, and later on, the `bowler-hat' sequence that takes place in the museum. In something of an homage to the original 1968 `Crown,' Banning is taken aloft by Crown in his glider, which proves to be visually stunning, and adds a placid moment that fits in well with the overall film. The supporting cast includes Faye Dunaway (Crown's psychiatrist), Ben Gazzara (Andrew), Frankie Faison (Detective Paretti), Fritz Weaver (John) and Charles Keating (Friedrich). McTiernan has fashioned a romantic caper that is satisfying to both the eye and the mind; and with an imaginative plot and the performances of Brosnan and Russo, `The Thomas Crown Affair' is a success on all fronts. Compared, especially, to many of the contemporary movies that purport romance and suspense, this one is the real deal. It's like a breath of fresh air that's risen above the prevailing smog of mediocrity. If you're looking for quality, and a film that delivers on it's promise, you've come to the right place. This is one you do not want to miss. I rate this one 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie if you cut the last 30 or so seconds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never submitted comments, but this time I feel so ripped off I really have to say something. Spoiler-free version: stop the VCR or turn off the TV about 30 seconds before the end, if you want to know why please read ahead.** SPOILERS ALERT READ AT YOUR OWN RISK **This movie would have been an 8/10 if it wasn't for the last 30 seconds or so (the scene in the airplane): I really can't understand why a movie has to be ruined for the sake of the typical happy ending.My opinion is that the director wanted to cut the movie with the main female character on the plane, just before the obvious handkerchief appears, but that the powers-that-be thought that such a perfectly logical, consequential and meaningful ending would have been too much to bear for the average movie goerThe director probably decided to try, without succeeding, to not ruin the movie by cutting the following scene short. I wish he just had the guts to stand his ground and let the male character do what most people in his situation would do.My advice: turn off the vcr/television as soon as you see the female character on the airplane, maybe you can wait 5 more seconds if you want, but please do not wait for what happens after the handkerchief magically appears beside her.Vote: first 112 and a half minutes 8/10, last 30 seconds 1/10, average 5/10</fullReview>

The good parts: the film gets a whole lot better the last half hour or so, there is plenty of chemistry between Russo and Brosnan, and the film looks great -- the production design, the cinematography and so on.

		<shortDescription>Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Thomas Crown Affair" is one of the few remakes that I like better than the original. It was quite entertaining, to say the least, and the music, oh, Bill Conti's fabulous piano music is wonderful. Complete with an overall tone that is quite lighthearted and fun little plot twists, "The Thomas Crown Affair" beats the original one because it doesn't take itself nearly as seriously as that one did, and because it's still relatively new, can't be labeled as horribly dated. One treat about this, along with this film having money sprinkled all over it like sand on a beach, was that the actors had actually been through puberty already. They were actually over forty and not playing a mother or father. Granted at times the situations were totally unrealistic and in there just... to be there (i.e. Rene Russo's dancing bit in the suggestive dress in a party she wasn't even invited to), the movie doesn't go too tacky or insult us on things that are vital to the plot's structure. A fun movie, especially if you're in the mood for entertainment and will allow for minor gaps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining But Flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why just about every film on the market today is a remake of a 60's classic. It speaks volumes about the credibility of the film industry 30 years ago and not a lot about it's worth 30 years on. Steve McQueen in particular would have been so honoured that so much of his work is being redone and modernized today. To assess what he would have thought of this piece of re-modelling is debatable.The film's premise is similar but not an exact rip-off. Bored billionaire Thomas Crown steals a Monet just for the sheer challenge. Everyone thinks an inept bunch of burglars are responsible until bounty hunter Catherine Banning comes on the scene. Banning pursues Crown relentlessly in order to recover the art work. Matters get complicated when a steamy affair develops between the two. The stakes have changed; the line between duty and love may or may not be crossed and as expected Director McTiernan makes everything look really cool and entertaining.Brosnan is well able to take on the McQueen role; his efforts to pull off the debonair type sometimes go noticed but overall he fits and suits the bill. I couldn't imagine another modern day actor being able to demonstrate the sophisticated class and elegance that Brosnan can. Russo is another issue entirely. Before I get critical I will say that I appreciated the two leads being in the same age bracket for once in the 90's. I can't get over this obsession film makers have to cast male leads opposite female bombshells 30 years their junior. For once this was avoided. The trouble is Russo projects a dislikeable aura to her character. She is supposed to be Brosnan's equal but her personality fails to win over the viewer; she ends up getting on our nerves rather than impressing us with her wits. Denis Leary is the orthodox policeman who is predicatably made to look stupid, along with all the other cops, by Russo's perceptiveness and skill. He is very watchable, albeit when he is spitting out crude comments, but he is made to look so dense by Russo that his fans get annoyed. Imagine a police detective whose every idea (with regard to the crime)is wrong or insignificant or refuted. Just wouldn't happen!! And then imagine a female bounty hunter who bypasses all police procedure based on gut feeling, and not only gets away with it but mocks the ineptitude of her male counterparts!!! Never happens!!Ultimately, Thomas Crown is an entertaining film because it's demands aren't excessive; we can sit back and enjoy the glamorous sets, slick dialogue, pretty actors, and crafty action set pieces. The finale is especially clever and the film is worth watching for the final heist alone. Dare I say it, but the raunchy dance scene is also a must see attraction because the intended erotic flavour ends up being overshadowed by laughable gesticulations on both the actors parts.This film is hard leave alone; it's good enough but warrants the criticism. If you are not a person who nit-picks every detail, you may well love it. If you are, you may grow increasingly impatient and annoyed. I lie somewhere in between these two avenues; I do pick up on details but not enough for my enjoyment of the film to be marred.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pierce Brosnan &amp; Rene Russo - a sizzling fun time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director John McTiernan (of 1988 "Die Hard" and 1990 "The Hunt for Red October" fame) gives us a romantic 1999 sizzling pairing of Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo, as Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway were matchlessly paired in Norman Jewison's 1968 classy thriller 'The Thomas Crown Affair." Denis Leary turned in a rare low-key performance previously of Paul Burke's role. The plot is practically playful in mood and more glamorous with intimate lovemaking scenes/moments. The love between the two leads is more evident and involving than the McQueen and Dunaway version. Fun is the key. Caribbean locale at Martinique. Rich man's games. Sophisticated pastimes. Museum setting and art/painting appreciation. Playful and clever heist plot using Magritte's famous bowler hat and coat figure plus suitcase! Rene is like a growling cat with zest and spunk. Pierce has his indisputable charm even though with furrowed brows and wrinkles. Together they succeeded in delivering an enjoyable entertaining movie.Veteran director Norman Jewison's McQueen and Dunaway version will always be the definitive first edition, stylish and intelligent in its own right. From the very first frame and the gradual buildup visual intro, to the last moment of the ending, and Michel Legrand's award winning tune "The Windmills of Your Mind", "The Thomas Crown Affair" 1968 is timelessly indelible. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>This new Thomas Crown affair is better than the old one for so many reasons! It seems as though they took everything that was wrong with the McQueen/Dunaway version and perfected it for Brosnan/Russo! Pierce is much more crafty in his art thievery than boring old Steve's bank robbery. And Rene?? Whew! She is at her seductive best. Her costume designers deserve extra kudos for that dress she wore at the ball! If you're a fan of Mr. Brosnan's charm and good looks, this will not let you down either. The cat and mouse game this two play is absolutely captivating. I also much preferred the ending on this one, I won't spoil it for you, but only say that it was different.. and better! I also thought it was very neat to stick Faye in there as Crown's psychotherapist, and enjoyed her supporting role much more than her lead one. Congrats and applause to those who made the changes and brought about this remake and to anyone who did not enjoy the original Thomas Crown Affair, don't bypass this one, it's definately an exciting ride worth taking!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I watched this movie, I was worried hat it would simply be a cheap imitation of Pierce Brosnan playing James Bond while not playing James Bond. After the movie was over I decided that Thomas Crown is all the good things about James Bond plus a few extra. For one, Crown is a lot looser than Bond could ever be. The best part of this movie is the sense of humor that all the characters have. Crown is a very rich individual that still seeks a challenge. When the mergers and acquisitions business becomes boring, he resorts to other means. It was interesting to see someone commit a crime just for the sake of doing it. The only gain that he gets from the activity is the couple of minutes of excitement that it provided. This was perfectly played against Rene Russo's character. She is also the woman who always gets what she wants. In her case it is art thieves. The best parts of this movie are when the two of them are trying to accomplish their respective goals, even though they run counter to each other. Overall this is an excellent movie and I recommend that anyone should see it at least once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching The Thomas Crown Affair, you'll start to wish that your own life could be like the one you see unfolding in front of you. Thomas Crown, bored with mergers and acquisitions, decides it would be fun to pull an elaborate heist. He steals a valuable painting with such ease and panache, you can't help but smile. Enter Catherine Banning, an insurance agent who is determined to reclaim the painting, and get Crown at the same time. What follows is a entertaining cat and mouse game that has one nifty climax. Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo are in top form playing the two evenly matched characters and at the helm of the film, is John McTiernan. McTiernan handles the action well and keeps your eyes on the screen, wondering what the next scene will entail. All in all, The Thomas Crown is a diverting film. It's good for a laid back evening, and it's a good mixture of romance and action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever, exciting, but a silly plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is difficult to judge the remake of The Thomas Crown Affair without continually comparing, and contrasting, it with the superb original which it touches at many points. Yet it is far from being a pastiche. The fundamentals of the plot are the same in both cases: crime as a diversion from extreme wealth and alienation, and the mutual fascination of investigator and investigated. In the original, Steve McQueen's Crown was as serious and professional about the theft of money as he was about everything else in his life. The problem with the plot of this version is that the crime is just too much of a hobby, too much of a silly game intended to indulge Crown's whimsy or to please a girl. His alienation, especially as evidenced in the rather ridiculous sessions with the psychiatrist (Faye Dunaway), seems merely inconsequential, even childish.Denise Russo's Catherine Banning is interestingly different from the Vicky of the original. They are alike in being roles that require little action or acting, but Miss Russo's investigator is an intriguing confusion of the sophisticated with the banal, of the sleek with the tawdry, with none of the dependence of slight gestures to signify major transformations. The central game that made the 1968 original a masterpiece, that defining game of chess, is absent in the remake. It turns out that after a little attention and a few days in the Caribbean, Banning falls for her man. Just like that. There is no tension to it, nor, despite all the talk of it, is there really any sense of a cat and mouse contest. Although Banning is given, and takes, the opportunity to betray Crown, she is not the master of this game - throughout, it is Crown who sets the rules and leads the play. And, in the end, it is he who gets the girl on his terms: the uncertainty and ambiguity, that in 1968 had peppered the relationship of Crown and Vicky right through to the end, is absent in the newer version.Still, this is an enjoyable and clever movie, with good performances from the two leading characters. They completely eclipse the rest of the cast. The final museum scene, with Magritte's derby multiplying exponentially, is well done and tremendous fun. Russo's portrayal of social ambiguity and slightly forced sensuality are particularly admirable. A strange sidelight on her role is cast by her preoccupation with liquids, the consumption of which seems almost a fetish. She consumes, often noisily, a vast quantity and range of fluids during this movie, from vintage champagne to a product most closely resembling sludge. Perhaps this affectation exposes the fundamental absurdity of the plot, an absurdity that is there in the original, but to which we there willingly surrender. Here, in 1999, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, it's just silly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How could Catherine love Thomas Crown? On the island, she says, "Do you think there's really happily ever after for people like us?" What does she mean "us"? She wasn't a person like him until she met him. She wasn't a thief, she wasn't unprincipled. In one scene, he wants her to be jealous to make sure she's not just after the painting. What about him? How did she know he wasn't romancing her just to keep her from turning him in? And how could her trust her? If she didn't turn him in, she was cheating on the company she worked for, not to mention letting him break the law. He also tells her that if they go away with the painting, they'll be fugitives with means? Why do that when he could be a billionaire with his freedom? I just don't understand how Catherine could fall for someone who doesn't even make sense. And why didn't she say, "If YOU love ME, return the painting", instead of letting him corrupt her? In one scene, Catherine says to him, "Do you really think I'm going to sleep with a man I'm investigating?" As it turned out, the answer was, "Yes, and I'm going to corrupt you and break you heart, too." Catherine started out as a self-assured, intelligent woman and then totally fell apart. Crown started out as a manipulative creep and stayed that way. I will never understand what is appealing about these characters or this love story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An 'Affair' to forget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this stylish -- but boring -- remake of the Steve McQueen classic, Pierce Brosnan goes through the motions as Thomas Crown, the bored billionaire who decides to steal an expensive Monet painting from a museum. Rene Russo is the insurance investigator who's out to get Crown but finds herself falling in love with him. The chemistry between the two leads is weak and supporting cast including Denis Leary and Faye Dunaway (from the original) can't rescue this sorry remake. At least the performances of McQueen and Dunaway were convincing. My evaluation: *? out of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While sitting on my friend's couch, viewing The Thomas Crown Affair, I could have sworn I was watching another James Bond movie. But then I would say to myself "no wait, this film actually had a good plot and is somewhat original, at least compared to the Bond films"It wasn't until later that I realized the film was a newer version of an old movie from 1968 also called The Thomas Crown Affair starring Mr. Cool, Steve McQueen.Anyhoo, the movie who's plot isn't the most easiest to follow, but not the hardest either is about a billionaire business man who has a strong liking for Monet and adventure/excitement. He would have had no trouble buying an expensive piece ($100 million) by his favorite artist, but instead he risks everything he has and steals it (in a very James Bond like manner).The rest of the film I will not give away, but it includes some hot and heavy love makin', a sweet-ass police chase through the museum and a happy ending for everybody. Below are some of my highlights and lowlights from the film.Best scene: When the cops are chasing the "Bowler Man" through the museum.Best acting: Pierce Brosnan (Thomas Crown)Worst acting: Rene Russo (Catherine Banning)After thoughts: Pierce Brosnan plays the ideal billionaire. Who wouldn't want to marry this guy; beats the pants off of the Who Wants to Marry A Millionaire guy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, those two theft scenes at the start and end of the movie are just so well orchestrated and clever! They really make the movie. In the middle I would agree with most people that the film dragged slightly, but not enough to make me bored, even on my second viewing. Overall it exuded class, with exotic, beautifully shot locations, exotic and interesting characters (great casting!) and an engaging score to boot.Regarding other comments, I don't know why so many people are comparing it to Entrapment, the connection didn't spring to mind at all for me. Also I don't know why so many people are slating this film, as it seems to have elements that would appeal to a wide range of viewers. Maybe these elements were so well balanced that they cancelled each other out for viewers interested in only one side of the story.I haven't seen the original so can't compare, but I think this is a very good film on its own and voted it a 9.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fairly good caper film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Thomas Crown Affair," on the surface appears to be an essentially formulaic tale of an unlikely romance between a master thief and the female investigator out to nail him. Nevertheless, it transcends its overworked genre somewhat through its concentration on the moral ambiguity of at least one of its two leading protagonists.A remake of the 1968 Norman Jewison film, starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway, this new version features Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo in a cat-and-mouse tale that makes up in style what it lacks in credibility. Brosnan plays Thomas Crown, a multi-billionaire CEO, who, bored with the tedious world of corporate finances, decides to mastermind the theft from the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art of a Monet original valued at over $100 million. Russo is the investigator, Catherine Banning, hired by the insurers of the painting who comes to suspect early on Crown's involvement in the caper.Although the film follows the traditional path on which such tales invariably tread - sexy and attractive antagonists square off, feint punches, give in to their mutual attraction and finally resolve the ethical complications of their relationship -, this film achieves a certain level of depth in the character of the investigator embodied by the dazzling Ms. Russo. Her indecisiveness, as she attempts to resolve her growing love for this charismatic thief with her intellectual understanding of the immorality of his actions, provides an added dimension that piques the audience's interest even during the inevitable side forays into tedious photographic distractions that seem like standard issue requirements for romantic films these days: flights on motorized hang gliders, trips to Caribbean hideaways, heated, passionate frolics on beds, tables, beaches and stairs. Somehow, through all the gloss and glaze on the film's surface, Catherine's wan vulnerability and genuine sense of moral confusion touch the viewer's emotions. Crown is less successful in that arena; despite Brosnan's debonair attractiveness (or, perhaps, because of it), the character really doesn't win the viewer over, for underneath all the self-assured gutsiness and romantic palaver, he is really not a very admirable person. Not only is he willing to take what is not his, despite his almost obscene quantity of personal wealth, but he displays no qualms about setting up some (admittedly reprehensible) criminal assistants to take the fall for him while leaving himself virtually unscathed. Viewed in this cold light of objectivity, Crown does not rate as the admirable romantic character the script obviously expects him to be. Such moral ambivalence works well in serious films dedicated to the study of the complexities of human behavior; in a slick romantic tale such as this, such an attitude makes it rather hard to identify with and root for the otherwise well matched main players.Still, the film does succeed well with Russo's character. It is she who carries this heist film far beyond the bounds of its often stifling conventions. Just take a gander at a similar film from 1999, "Entrapment," as a point of negative comparison. In that matchup, "The Thomas Crown Affair" wins quite handily.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie to be exceptionally enjoyable. As I have never seen the original, I cannot do any comparison; thus, does this movie has enough to stand on its own merits? I say absolutely. Pierce Brosnan puts in a superb performance as the billionaire looking for a little more excitement in his life. And I'll agree with everyone else that Rene Russo adds definite sparkle, energy, and charisma with her performance.What really sets this movie apart for me is the ending. I found the ending to be one of the most satisfying conclusions in some time. It isn't cheesey, for it fits the characters so well and makes sense. It's quite ingenious how we got to this point.Of course, the movie isn't perfect. There are some obvious continuity errors which haven't been posted on this site yet. But beyond that, I feel that the movie should have somehow ended in the museum and not carried on beyond that. I felt the movie was starting to drag a bit at that point. And, believe it or not, I actually got bored with seeing Rene Russo's breasts after awhile! Heaven forbid a man getting tired of nudity!But, all in all, an exceptionally satisfying movie....with a charming little soundtrack to boot!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And why are both so dumb and unrealistic? Ok, I can suspend my disbelief for the sake of a good movie. But this is not one of those times. It's Hollywood escapism at its worst. I guess the message to all the young ladies out there is: If your are good-looking and sassy enough like Rene Russo or Faye Dunaway, some very rich and handsome man will wisk you away to a tropical island, shower you with lavish gifts and expensive restaurants. While all the time being utterly fantastic in bed. That film premise might have worked thirty or forty years ago, but today it's insulting. Come on, this wasn't even a good story! It was so predictable, that I left the movie for a full half hour, came back and knew exactly what was going on. This movie offered very little surprises, save for where the painting finally turned up. So let me get this straight; it's alright for a spoiled rich guy to steal priceless paintings, as long as he puts them back; and in way so he doesn't get caught? A big happy, sappy ending in which you don't mind a criminal getting away because he's good-looking, rich, and loves the woman. This is how Hollywood operates, and I'm getting so tired of it.</fullReview>

It reminded me a lot of James Bond (less action) and it reminded me a lot of Remington Steele (more sophisticated). It also reminded me of another recent movie - Entrapment - however, this was a little more enjoyable than that.Actually, if not for a few absurd holes early on, I might have been tempted to give it a 9. I really have a problem with obvious blunders - things that couldn't have happened. That makes me downgrade it slightly.I thought Rene Russo and Pierce Brosnan had good chemistry. The cat and mouse game they played with each other was (if not classic) at least entertaining. But, I have to confess that I didn't get the whole Faye Dunaway thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good movie, although rather high-tech and elaborate. I have not seen the first one, although it is on my rental list. Russo is a mind-player in this one, she tests him and pushes his buttons, and she does it well. He is even a little scared at times of her motives and inquiries (and that is hard for Brosnan to do!). These two have alot of chemistry and animal attraction to burn off. One complaint: Rene Russo is a highly respected actress in my book, and we could have done without the sex scenes. I enjoy her work, but did not need to see her naked. Recommended if you like crime caper, highly-charged romance with a twist of action/adventure. Rating: 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1999 "high-tech" remake of The Thomas Crown affair is charged with unexpected and delectable bends and twists. It definitely is entertaining and worth adding to your DVD or VHS collection. Pierce Brosnan shows us he can, actually, perform much better than in any of the three James Bond he did so far, but it is Renne Russo who steals the show ! Despite being a much different person in real life (which reminds us of Anne Parillaud in La Femme Nikita), she really lives her character. The story is captivating and John McTiernan, known for his strong action movies (Die Hard, The Hunt for Red October), does a good job directing it.Casting Faye Dunaway as Crown's therapist, and making repeated use of Michel Legrand's Oscar winning wonderful musical score "Windmills of My Mind", of course, reminds us of the 1968 original "affair", and there is no way but to admit that Steve McQueen's performance is superior there, the chemistry between the two is much more intense, and there is more craft and subtlety in director's Norman Jewison's unfolding and revealing it to us.Watch and enjoy both "affairs" ! (rating - 1999: 7.0/10; 1968: 8.5/10).</fullReview>

Although a bit predictable at times, I did enjoy the few twists and turns. I thought that the romantic scenario was typical "Hollywood," but somehow it never fails to work.I enjoyed the character of Thomas Crown. What man doesn't fantasize about being a "Thomas Crown" --abundance of wealth, pulling power-plays with a grin, secluded island hideaway with a sexy woman, etc. Looked like fun to me! Brosnan fit the part like a glove, with his look and ever so cool persona. I was reminded of "Bond" at times, although these attributes are probably the ingredients that favor him as a choice for these types of roles. At first I wasn't sure about Rene Russo playing the part of Catherine Banning. In the beginning Catherine was a little too brash for me but as the movie progressed her character grew on me, as did Rene.I also enjoyed Sting's rendition of an old classic.I say lay your money down, sit back and enjoy a 90's kind of movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Far be it from me to come down hard on an actor like Pierce Brosnan, who has made a career out of being suave and debonair, but that kind of characterization really can only carry an actor so far. This remake of the 1968 film that starred Steve McQueen is about a multigabillionaire investment banker who happens to be an art thief. Well, he's struck again, and it's up to the luscious Rene Russo (as an insurance investigator) to catch the thief.Similarities to the more recent Entrapment abound - in that one, Sean Connery was the suave rich fella with an eye for art, and Catherine Zeta-Jones was the sexy insurance investigator. The problem with that film might have been the romance between Zeta-Jones and Connery, who easily is old enough to be her grandfather. In this film, the two characters appear to rather close in age, so at least that quibble doesn't exist.So let's see what we have. We know right from the beginning that Crown has stolen yet another priceless work of art, so that bit of suspense is gone. And we know that our friendly neighborhood insurance investigator (did you know they can be sexy, too? Who knew?) will nab him not by catching him in the act but by - ahem - pretending to fall for him so she can learn his methods and turn him in as an insider. When you know your 'good guy' is willing to risk it all to get her man, you know her credibility is shot. The chances of her keeping her head above water and not falling for him are incredibly slim, and we know that as the movie progresses we'll see Crown as less of a thief and more of a victim. Ho-hum.Now that I've blasted the script, let's look at the actors' work. Brosnan plays Crown pretty much the way you'd expect him to - aloof, cunning, intelligent - kind of like a James Bond Lite. He doesn't bring a whole lot of excitement to the role, other than the fact that he's Pierce Brosnan. As far as Russo goes - well, she did several inexplicable gratuitous nude (topless, anyway) scenes in this film. Now, sometimes gratuitous nudity is okay in my book - it can distract you from an otherwise dull film. But it seems to me the only reason Russo - an accomplished actress - would consent to showing her breasts is to demonstrate she's not bad-looking ... for a woman in her forties. Other than for vanity reasons, there's no reason in the world for her to get naked. (And for what it's worth, I kind of wish Catherine Zeta-Jones had done the same in Entrapment!)For me, this movie wasn't even good as escapist fare. Quite frankly, a suspense movie with no suspense has little going for it, although the lush production locations did ease the boredom a little.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thomas Crown Affair is one of the best movies I have ever seen and one of the best remakes ever made. There was much talking about comparing Brosnan with McQueen, Russo with Dunaway. I agree that the original '68 movie is perfect, and it is one of my favorites, but '99 remake is perfect and beautiful in it own way, it is perfect in 90s: charming Brosnan, beautiful Russo and extravagant Ester Canadas make the '99 edition different in time. Maybe people who do not agree should see both movies one more time and they should notice the difference, which makes both 'Affairs' unique in its own way. These beautiful people in '99 movie make it unforgettable, all love scenes look like there were shot in Eden, and characters perfectly fit both Brosnan and Russo. And at the beginning of the movie when i heard the voice of Faye Dunaway I did not believe my ears until I saw that it was her and I think it is also one unique touch of the latest remake.To make the long story shorter, this is a 'must-see' movie and I think even people who argue which 'Affair' is better, those who think that new one does not come close to the original, anyway they should have liked this movie more then they talk about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1968, a rather pretentiously showy movie called "The Thomas Crown Affair" was made. It starred 38 year old Steve McQueen, one of the most charismatic actors ever to hit the screen and 27 year old Faye Dunaway, then a sexy hot property after "Bonnie and Clyde". There was real chemistry between these two and you could understand the mutual attraction.In 1999 somebody with more money than sense decided to remake this movie. In the role taken by charismatic 38 year old McQueen we get 48 year old Pierce Brosnan, who always checks his charisma at the studio gate and couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. Worse, the Dunaway role is taken by Rene Russo, 45 years old and looking every minute of it.There is no chemistry between the two leads and, whereas in the McQueen movie you want him to get away with it, in this one you just ache for the cops to nail Crown and wipe the self satisfied smirk off of his face.One of the best things about the '68 picture was "Windmills of Your Mind", which in the new version is murdered by Bill Conti, whose score is execrable.All in all, a woebegone effort by all concerned</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goes where Entrapment wouldn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah, this movie is like Entrapment in about 2,000 ways, but it was a much better movie-watching experience. With Entrapment they would show anything, because they were too busy trying to keep it at PG-13. A lot more effort seemed to be put into this movie. Rene Russo isn't exactly Faye Dunaway, but she delivers a strong performance, as does Pierce Brosnan; Who also proves that his whole career is not James Bond. Lastly, I have no idea why everyone continues to talk about how unattractive Faye Dunaway is in this movie. She looks fine, leave her alone...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rather good remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You may recall the original `Thomas Crown'. Faye Dunaway is an insurance company's investigator, Steve McQueen is the thief she is after. But then they begin to feel an attraction to each other.The original movie has something of a cult following, but it is a cult to which I never belonged: the movie struck me as static and somewhat self-conscious.The remake is a great improvement on the original in every respect. Pierce Brosnan brings a cool sophistication to his role as a New York financial magnate and society figure with a weakness for art theft. And Rene Russo brings a forceful determination to the role of Catherine Banning which makes her the perfect foil for Connery.The film is visually gorgeous, has two strong leads, an interesting premise and a strong ending. However, there are quite a few slow moments in the central portion of the film. These could have been brought to life with the appropriate film score; Bill Conti, creator of many superb orchestral scores in the past, could no doubt have created just the right ambience. But his percussive score often seems inappropriate and distracting.The film is a superior effort, and makes for rewarding viewing. But for an even better film along similar lines, have a look at Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones in "Entrapment".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brosnan and Rene look anorexic; the sex scenes were grotesque; museum scenes were credible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whatever this film needed in the way of atmosphere, drama, intrigue, suspense failed to materialize overall. I found the dance sequence, supposedly a gradual transition from sophisticated interaction to grand passion truly laughable. And the actual "love-making" was embarrassingly unemotional, un-sexy. The scene in Rio with Rene lying on top of Pierce looked like a frame from a PBS special on weird mating rituals. A long shot might have worked....but the close-up made her look like some kind of giant blown-up figure. I think I'll find the original if it's available and enjoy it on my VCR.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classy Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit when I heard this was a remake, I was in some way sceptical because of a trend that re-makes somehow loses most of the quality, we only have to look at Psycho, you can't make a remake of such as great film and hope to achieve anything. However I was lucky to be able to see both the original and the remake and I have to say that for once I thought the remake had more quality that the original. Pierce Brosnan is on top form as Thomas Crown the high flying and extremely rich business man,and Rene Russo it great as Catherine Banning the insurance inspector.  If you've seen the original then you'll still like this film, if you missed the original then I would recommend this version every time.The crime is more elaborate and the overall feel of the film simply feels more classy and suitable for the subject matter. There will be other people who think the original is the better, but what would the world be like if we all agreed. Overall if you want to watch a really well thought out and nicely shot film then you can't go far wrong with this one, a pleasure to watch.</fullReview>

The plot centers around Thomas Crown (Brosnan) who will do anything for fun (including crash a hundred thousand dollar boat for the thrill). When a painting is taken, he becomes the prime suspect. In comes Catherine Banning (Russo), who is there to 'help' the investigators (Leary) capture the crook. And that is how a delicious game of cat-and-mouse comes into being. Brosnan is in Bond-mode for his character, but this is Russo's party. A delight!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thomas Crowne Affair was originally released in 1968 starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway. Although I am not able to compare the current release to the original (having never seen the original), I was able to watch and enjoy the movie without predisposition. To me, one of the most important qualities in a movie is a good story; this movie certainly has that. The stars Pierce Brosman and Rene Russo play their roles convincingly. The dialogue between them is witty and sophisticated; the soundtrack is cool and pleasant. A nice touch in the current release is the return of Faye Dunaway, this time as Crown's therapist. Throughout the movie, I kept thinking to myself that I'd love to be Thomas Crowne, even if just for one day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"How do you get the man who has everything?" Thomas Crown doesn't know what everything is. He has tons of money and all he can do for fun is steal things? Donald Trump bought himself a modeling agency and a beauty pageant. Ted Turner has a baseball team, TV shows and he gave a billion dollars to the U.N. And he married Jane Fonda. I had no sympathy for Mr. Crown. As for Catherine Banning, she is at first disgustingly sexual, then turns into a weepy, jealous wimp. And why did she have to be topless on the beach? Crown didn't even notice. He's known her for less than a week and already the sight of her breasts bores him? Maybe some audience members enjoyed that scene. And what kind of woman accepts an expensive necklace from a man she hardly knows, let alone one she's trying to expose as a thief? All I can say is, those two characters deserved each other.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike the terrible old neurotic version, the new version is much more dynamic and suspenseful, the new soundtrack is much more uptempo than the original. A GREAT DATE movie. I've ordered both the new soundtrack and await the new DVD (pre-orders coming, inevitably). As the press has noted, Rene Russo exudes a "spark" normally found in younger actresses. Or allowed younger actresses, based on the predisposition of the industry casting process toward younger women. Pierce Brosnan gets to be a real man's hero, more rounded than some previous, less dimensional characters he's played. Can't believe it's only 98 minutes. I highly recommend it. Good plot changes from the original. Best to treat them as two different movies. Great kudo to Faye Dunaway to have her in this remake, and I'm so glad she isn't wearing those fake nails anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An improvement on the original. No classic, though.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this better than the 1968 original, but neither of them lived up to the promise of the premise.I like heist stuff; the complex plans, the sneaky execution. This 1999 remake had a lot more of that sort of thing than the original did, which was a plus for me.Then of course, the romance comes along to muck everything up. For some reason, someone thought it necessary to include a great deal of sex and nudity. (And hey, I enjoy a little female skin as much as the next guy, but there comes a point when even I start thinking "Why doesn't she just put her shirt on and get on with the story?")Although I've always liked Rene Russo, her character here is not well done. She's supposed to come across as one of those fictional movie women who is just better at everything than anyone you've ever met. She's more intelligent, more talented, more experienced, more passionate, more daring, etc. But she comes across as over-the-top rather than larger-than-life. It's a screenplay problem, or maybe a directorial problem, not her fault, but it's a shame.Pierce Brosnan is very good for this part, I think, and his character (having a lot in common with James Bond and Remington Steele) is less of a stretch for him. His Thomas Crown is cool, calculating, and sophisticated. He's always one step (or more) ahead of everyone else in the movie, but you don't end up hating him for it.All in all, an entertaining evening for the bargain-basement $2 admission I paid. I wouldn't have been too happy paying full price, though.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the "Thomas Crown Affair" at the theater. I had not seen the 1968 version with Steve McQueen, so cannot compare the two.I found it hard not to look at Pierce Brosnan as "James Bond", because his character in this movie is very similar. But, of course, he is the "bad" guy. He plays his role very well.I never cared for Renee Russo before, but as the art insurance detective and romantic interest, she was very enjoyable.All-in-all a very entertaining movie. No one gets killed, there are only a few swear words, and the nude scenes are very well done. You have to follow the clues to figure out exactly what is going on, and there are some good 'twists' along the way. However, I found the ending a bit hokey and not up to the standards of the rest of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What do you get for the man that has everything? Apparently a mindless remake. John McTiernan's version of the 1968 film starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway falls short of actual amusement and is even occasionally excruciating ? save the brilliant ending that easily one-ups its predecessor. Leonard Maltin called the original `perfect non-think entertainment,' and the remake offers more of the same.Pierce Brosnan plays Thomas Crown, an art-loving multimillionaire who spends his time plotting the perfect heist. Like the original, most of the film's first half-hour is devoted to the theft of a valuable painting from a museum (originally just over $2 million, but here a $100 million Monet). Catherine Banning (Rene Russo, Lethal Weapon 4) is an insurance agent for the museum and, together with NYPD detective Michael McCann (Denis Leary, True Crime), immediately suspects Crown and tries to mount her case against him. The trouble is that somewhere along the line, Banning mounts more than her case.Casting-wise, the suave and debonair Brosnan is a much better choice than McQueen, but Russo is downright horrible in Dunaway's role. She looks awful and acts even worse. Leary seems lost as the cop and the film could have used more of his sarcastic spunk. The score never really seemed to fit the picture, and viewers will have a hard time connecting with any of the characters. Those responsible for the updated script include Leslie Dixon (the abominable That Old Feeling) and Kurt Wimmer (Sphere). Of other note, viewers should now know to be wary of any film that prominently displays a bowler hat (remember The Avengers?).Alan Trustman's original screenplay (he also wrote the superior McQueen vehicle Bullitt) may have seemed invigorating in 1968, but today seems as stale as a cardboard pizza with felt pepperoni ? especially since we all recently suffered through a very similar cat-and-mouse chase in Entrapment. The original, directed by Norman Jewison (Moonstruck), was shot by the legendary Haskell Wexler (Limbo) and included the use of what I like to call Brady Bunch windows ? several smaller multi-image screens that make up the entire frame. Also look for Dunaway, who plays Crown's shrink in the updated version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Basically, a disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a severe disappointment. Nearly every other critic mentioned approvingly that Pierce Brosnan had chosen to play opposite an actress of his own age, and that was one of the reasons I was interested. Only to find that the part, as it was written, ought to have been played by someone just out of her teens. Catherine Benning behaves like some ditsy graduate barely out of college, screeching and giggling whenever Crown lands a surprise or present on her (something he does in best Barbara Cartland style, and this is meant to be sophisticated?!), weeping like an idiot when she thinks herself cheated, as if this were a first romance for her. A girl from the Midwest who made good in Europe, an equal match for a blase millionaire too rich for his own good? She can't convince us, and thus the entire romance fails. But the most embarrassing moment comes when Rene Russo is made to interrogate one of the suspects, pretending to be familiar with German. She cannot pronounce it properly (as a native German I had trouble recognizing the words as my mothertongue), she gets the cadence wrong and she makes it sound as if she didn't understand a single word she was saying. Maybe they should have cast Sandra Bullock for this, she at least would be fluent in the language and she would have been much more at ease with this giggly girlie stuff. There was a good caper movie buried in the script somewhere. A pity it got lost in the most unsatisfactory romance this year. The movie as it is doesn't engage our emotions, and that's partly because the romance doesn't work and partly because watching "silly rich people playing games", as Denis Leary's character put it, is not enough. Compared to this, "Entrapment" was a gem. And as for the oh-so-politically-incorrect May-December romances, if I had to choose between Sean Connery and Will Patton (or anyone else), I'd pick Connery. Any day of the week.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pierce Brosnan stars as the wealthy playboy Thomas Crown who organizes a painting heist just for the hell of it, and Rene Russo is the insurance agent who falls for him while investigating his fishy dealings.Although a surprisingly low action-scene frequency for a John McTiernan movie and a rather slow development it is cleverly unfolding into a very satisfying film. Visually attractive with spectacular vistas and exquisite set-pieces, The Thomas Crown Affair echoes that sense of seductive, old, classic entertainment.Naturally Pierce Brosnan does a standard, cool Bond performance, only this time he squeezes some comedy and sensitivity into the character. And Rene Russo captivates through forthrightness and vulnerability, reminding us how resourceful an actress she is.Not reaching for any depths but exposing laid-back elegance and a shapely, beautiful Russo, The Thomas Crown Affair is well-executed and mature amusement.</fullReview>

It detracted from the movie. I didn't mind the change in the story (bank to museum) but the movie lasted about 5min longer than it should have. I call it the "What's Up Doc?" ending. But it is well worth seeing. Brosnan and Russo were great and hopefully Denis Leary will get more dramatic roles after this.

Worst of all, this is clearly meant to be wish fulfillment by proxy. We are supposed to envy Crown his amazing talent for everything and his astonishing lifestyle. Instead, rather like with Sherlock Holmes, we end up thinking he's a very smug person who needs a good kicking. Perhaps in a country that lionises big businessmen, Crown would seem like a charming man. From here, I just wanted him arrested without delay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie,it was fun and entertaining at the same time!Unlike it's predecessor Entrapment this movie does not deal with alot of action,instead it has a really nice Affair between the two leads Brosnan(Thomas Crown) and Russo(Banning).A neat opening sequence full of suspense and Brosnan plays Crown with his Eyes Wide Shut..(aham) because he fits the role like a glove and Russo gets a rare chance to show-off her really sexy side especially during the Dance sequence with her netted evening gown.Hot!The film involves a Billionnare businessman(Crown) bored with life who in turn steals a 100 million dollar painting (A Monet) and finds out the greatest challenge is yet to be faced....a relationship.Enter Rene Russo who plays a insurance investigator Catherine Banning set out to find the thief.A nice soundtrack with some really cool photography and the perfect ward drobe.Directed by John Mctiernan(Die Hard With A Vengence and Predator) keeps the film engaging on all aspects and delivers one of the most enjoyable movies I have seen in a long time.Good for Brosnan as well who also happens to be the Producer of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An improvement on an overrated 'period' piece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nostalgia is always a good way of distorting the merits of any film. True, with time, works that 'bomb' on release often do substantiate their claim to fame. However, the original 'Thomas Crown Affair' (if severed from the umbilical of Steve McQueen's iconic status as the 'King of Cool') betrays significant weaknesses in both plot and characterisation. (One excellent chess scene does not a great film make!)Pierce Brosnan's remake of the 'Thomas Crown Affair' is a gripping and stylish thriller which justfiably establishes itself as a contemporary thriller rather than as advertisement for the fads and fashions of a particular era. Pierce Brosnan gives a menacingly enigmatic performance in the title role. Where Steve McQueen traded on his image, Pierce Brosnan sells the audience a disturbingly ammoral man who attracts as much as he repulses. Rene Russo, in perhaps her most accomplished role to date, provides a wonderfully aggressive counterpart to this moral dilletante, her own predatorial ethics arousing both lust and loathing in equal measure.The film's only real weaknesses lay with the director, John McTiernan. Although the action sequences are riveting, the love scenes do come across as a little too 'Die Hard'. The eroticism between the two leads may not be the stuff of panoramic beach scenes, but without something for the audience to find genuinely arousing in these scenes - no matter how unnerving - they become almost superfluous.Altogether - a must see. Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1967 and 1999 versions similar and both very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1967 version was viewed on videocassette, and the 1999 version at a local Multiplex, ON THE SAME DAY. I had not seen either of them previously. They were both good (I am rating them an Ebert 3-stars), but should not be compared. The stories were similar but really not the same. For a 1960's film, that version was interesting and very enjoyable; McQueen and Dunaway were good but not Oscar-material (neither are Brosnan and Russo). Camera-work, direction, editing, costuming, etc. were very good for the era. But, those attributes of the '99 version showed the advance of film production in all aspects; this script could not be produced in 1967. Both films were very good for their specific eras; I enjoyed them both.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pierce Brosnan is, without doubt, the handsomest man who ever drew a breath, and Rene Russo is gorgeous too! Yes, as others have commented, his character is icy cold, but that can be VERY exciting and attractive -- and in several scenes he DOES show us, and her, what he feels for her and why he does some of the things he does! I was pleased that Catherine didn't just tumble head-over-heels for Thomas, but maintained her integrity and principles till the end -- even while pantingly attracted to Thomas! The sex scenes, and the dance scene, were awesome -- steamy and erotic. I agree with someone else's comment -- we need to see Pierce Brosnan in a role where he can show his wit and humor as well as his cool, elegant exterior -- devastating as it is! A really enjoyable summer film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thomas Crown Affair (1999) ignites the senses. I absolutely loved every moment of this movie. Renee Russo was not only gorgeous, she made you feel the moment. Pierce Brosnan, what can I say, he was not only gorgeous, he was elegant, intense, vulnerable. He also had his own private cottage on a mountaintop overlooking what looked to be the blue Carribean with private beach.I fell in love with both the cat and the mouse, played by Russo and Brosnan, even the detective, played by Dennis Leary. Who cares that you probably would never be allowed to take a briefcase into a museum.I only just saw The Thomas Crown Affair (1968) shortly before this recent remake while switching channels on the TV one night, although, only up to the chess game and then I fell asleep. Of course, Steve McQueen was darling, but, I just never could see vivid blue eye shadow as a thing of beauty, even in the sixties. Faye Dunaway was lovely, sharp, and a nice diversion in the remake as Brosnan's psychiatrist.My husband and I floated out of the theatre after watching this movie, his arm tight around my shoulder, our passion for each other ignited.....Go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solidly entertaining, if unspectacular piece of entertainment...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The remake of The Thomas Crown Affair is in many ways an old fashioned film, with the pacing and especially the overall feel of the film being very deliberately paced. It's not the wham bam thriller that many may have been expecting to come from John McTiernan, best known for his adrenaline charged films such as 'Die Hard' (and it's second sequel 'Die Hard With A Vengeance'), 'The Hunt For Red October' and 'Predator', but it definitely doesn't suffer from that, and is in fact quite refreshing.Thomas Crown affair manages to rise above being simply yet another remake and actually manages, due to being well crafted and likeably acted, to be remarkably entertaining, especially given just how slight the overall premise (and film itself) is.The main contributing factors to this are a solid script by Alan Trustman, well handled direction from John McTiernan (especially during the films two caper scenes) and most of all a trio of great, fun performances by Pierce Brosnan, Denis Leary and especially Rene Russo. These three performances really do, above everything else, make the film as enjoyable as it is, and in fact I'd go as far as saying that they make the film full stop.The supporting performances are all likeable enough, with Frankie Faison and especially Faye Dunaway notable in providing good, solid support but overall it really is a vehicle for the three leads and they are the heart and center of the film. While it's definitely far from being groundbreaking and would doubtless never be classed as a 'great' film the truth of the matter is that The Thomas Crown Affair is a supremely enjoyable popcorn flick that more than attains it's objective to entertain, and what's so wrong with that? Good, light, entertaining fun.8/10 One Man's Opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Barely tolerable, but only because the first one was so bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marginally less awful than the original for a number of reasons. Firstly, the style. Don't get me wrong, the style here is bland and anonymous, but this is a relief after the ghastly flashiness of the original. That employed dim-witted split-screens, showy edits and ludicrous, unmotivated camera angles, which wearied the viewer with its monotony, like a loud, precocious kid. This remake is filmed like any standard-issue Hollywood film: flatly, without ever daring to waver into invention or cinematic frisson; with rather embarrassing attempts at 'class', but rarely headache-inducing.Secondly, the heists. The second one especially is a little gem of near-wit and surprise, but both, by utilising suspense and focus, tower over the botched cleverness of the original, which drowned any tension in its attempts to be 'formal' and modern.Thirdly, the female lead. Faye Dunaway has on occasion been known to be a reasonable, even beautiful actress, but she is lousy in THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR: like a drag caricature in ludicrous outfits, she is loud, unglamorous, clumsy, smarmy and dislikable. Rene Russo, though saddled with some equally dire outfits, manages to rise above a sketch role of blatant male fantasy (love some of the reviewers' euphemistic praise here of her 'outfits'!), with some real, tough, human, emotional acting, showing up the shoddy shallow enterprise for what it is. And yeah, she also looks gorgeous.One wouldn't have expected it, but the remake also manages to disimprove on the original in two ways. Firstly the lovely, melancholic Michel Legrand score, the only redeeming feature of the McQueen movie, is replaced by muzak variations on it rich theme, with contributions from the detestable Sting (loved the Brecht/Weill though. How on earth did that get in there?).The greatest crime of all, though, is Pierce Brosnan. Never has a man with so little talent been so pleased with himself. Steve McQueen, a real actor, was atrocious in the original, but was Marlon Brando compared to Brosnan. Cosmo Landoman has called his sense of cool 'Ferrero Rocher naff', and Brosnan's smug attempts at cool provide much unintentional comedy. He has simply no personality, no expressive qualities, his breaking into laughter is bovine and grotesque - it is simply unbelievable that a woman as smart, strong and gorgeous as Rene Russo would ever fall for this humorless cipher. Their love scenes were as risible as that awful chess set-piece.This film also retains the original's tasteless fetishisation of wealth (how thrillingly transgressive can a multi-billionaire stealing more money be?), an uncritiqued wallowing in a lifestyle that doesn't offer the humble viewer a vicarious entry into a normally inaccessible world, but rubs his or her inadequacy in his or her face. For such a vanity project, this is a very ugly film.At least it gropes for some seriousness - the obsession with the gaze, identity, reflections, authenticity, forgery, truth, trust, gender are all linked in the film's art heist subject matter. The punctuated visits of Crown to his psychiatrist are meant to show us his depth, pain, emptiness and identity crises, but only serve to demonstrate what an insufferable, self-regarding, spoilt brat he is. Dennis Leary (excellent, by the way)'s final rant about Art being an oppressive rich man's hobby is interesting, and hinted at throughout - there is little sense of the aesthetic or spiritual pleasures of art. However, by the time this speech comes, it seems more like a defence of the film's vulgarity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen the original Thomas Crown Affair, and I was not even aware that this version was a remake until I read the reviews for it. However, I remain firmly entrenched in the idea that I don't need to have a clue as to what the original film was like, just to judge whether or not the current version is worth seeing. I was somewhat surprised by all the criticism this film got, because I considered it to be a very clever movie with an excellent ending. There are not really all that many plot holes, and there is very little need for any suspended disbelief in order to enjoy an all-star cast with good chemistry and charisma. Granted, some of the blatant advertisements are enough to make the audience moan (especially when Rene Russo downs a can of Pepsi-1, making you think it was a commercial), but even that is not enough to dampen a bright spot for Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen the original Thomas Crown Affair as well as the recent one and I have to say that I preferred the remake. Not only is the Brosnan remake much more update (well it would be...) but the idea of switching the plot from bank to art was a great improvement because it wasn't the old cops and robbers cliche and it became a stylish robbery. Brosnan was more suave and sophisticated then Steve McQueen - which is what this role needs - and I thought Rene Russo added a lot of elegance to her role. The bowler hat idea was great and the romance scene was more realistic than the chess idea in the original. The original Thomas Crown needed to be updated to the 21st century and I think that Brosnan has done just that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great-looking and stylish film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have yet to see the original `The Thomas Crown Affair' so my review may or may not be a biased opinion. I really enjoyed this film because it was very stylish, had beautiful photography, beautiful costumes and beautiful actors. I must say that Rene Russo surely flatters the `middle-aged woman' because she is very much a knockout here for someone who is 44, respectively. Her wardrobe also contributed to making her one of the most glamorous looking characters I have seen in year. Now, moving right along? Pierce Brosnan seems to be very comfortable here, and he has reason to be: this is his `pre-James Bond' James Bond role before this Thanksgiving's `The World In Not Enough.' He fits the role just fine, I just don't think he was truly challenged. Having said that, Pierce and Rene had great chemistry together. They seem to massage the words before they say them and they ooze sexuality on the screen. Russo, however, challenges herself in her role for two reasons: she sheds her cookie-cutter image and becomes an engaging sex symbol; and she tackles her sporadic duty of leading-lady status, for she is mostly on screen in supporting roles. I appreciated how this film was more of a light romantic caper than an overly erotic crime thriller; it had a sweetness I didn't expect from this film. Many will compare this film to this year's similarly-themed `Entrapment,' which stars Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones, whom I thought had even better onscreen chemistry. The reason I rate `The Thomas Crown Affair' higher than `Entrapment' is because the dialogue was slicker and the caper sequences had more of a reality check. Director John McTiernan, of `Die Hard,' handled those scenes very skillfully and the twists and turns are extremely clever and inventive once played out. I recommend this for the nice chemistry between the leads, its stylish direction and Rene Russo's wardrobe.</fullReview>

I loved the original and doubted Mr Brosnan's ability to pull off a successful remake of one of my favorites. I was wrong, I feel that Mr. Brosnan and company have succeeded in making an excellent variation of the origianl story-line.Coming out of the theater I felt that I now have two excellent versions of the same basic story. My hat is off to Mr. Brosnan as well as Ms Russo (Wow!).Commenting on some of the details in the new Thomas Crown, I felt that the sound track was very good and contributed greatly to my enjoyment of the movie. Enough of the original music was kept to lend continuity between versions while the new material was excellent. The inclusion of Faye Dunaway in the film was an exciting and amusing touch. There is no way that the cinematography of the original could be duplicated so I was very glad that they didn't try. I was still happy with the cinematography of this version even though it cannot match that of the original.In summary, given that a successful remake is very rare I am very pleased to now have two excellent versions of one of my favorite stories.</fullReview>

It is by turn amusing, suspenseful, clever, and extremely romantic.Pierce Brosnan's cool, suave tycoon and Rene Russo's wonderfully offbeat insurance investigator square off over stolen art, and sparks do fly. Denis Leary does a nice job with his secondary role, and if Oscars were given out to people for giving looks that kill, Ester Canades, in a non-speaking role, would win.I had a lot of fun with this movie, and event though the original was in the back of my mind while watching it, I was still enjoying every bit of it, and curious as to how it would resolve.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Be it Acting, story, cinematography, art direction, you name it, Thomas Crown has it better than the original. Director John McTiernan has done a superlative job at bringing to life the original Alan R. Trustman story which made the 1967 Thomas Crown Affair a valuable addition to the classic Action/thriller genre. His cutting edge direction made every moment of this film a pleasure. Not one scene drags and the characters are explored in exacting detail. I can't imagine a multi millionaire of Thomas Crowns Stature played better than by Pierce Brosnan. The original character creation by Steve McQueen's looked as though his suit were a straight jacket. We have to admit though we cinema goers loved the man, there was no Classic quality in McQueen's face like there is in Brosnan's. Rene Russo was perfect as the investigator Catherine banning. Relentless in her carnality and designs to play Crown at his own game. The tension lasted right to the last minute. Frankie Faison breathed sensitive life into Detective Paretti and and an equally strong cast made this movie experience even more of a pleasure. In my opinion a copy which beat it's original hands down in every manner. What a nice touch to see the original female lead Faye Dunaway as Thomas Crowns psychiatrist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into the Thomas Crown Affair knowing only that there WAS an original and Pierce was reprising a role first played by Steve McQueen. I find it (sometimes) easier to rate a movie when you go in not immediately comparing it to its predecessor (try watching Jurassic Park after reading the novel).The '99 TCA was a slick and highly enjoyable film. I found the plot interesting with a few nice twists. Rene Russo happens to be in my top 3 favorite actresses and this was a very different role for her - she was excellent (and sexy too!)Pierce played his character well but there was not enough character development on him. He went from ruthless business tycoon to in-love mush in about 15 minutes. Not much transition. As opposed to the great job they did with Russo's multi-facted character.On the whole, I found it to be a much better than average film with fitting music, some great cimematography (watch for the island and sailing scenes), and great support work from Denis Leary, who is a great actor that needs to be in more movies like this! Go see it, you won't be disappointed. I have to go rent the original...</fullReview>

I find it really hard to combine all the movie's many good points and many bad points.I'll try describing some good-uns(British coinphrase)to kickstart the review.Rene Russo is a sexy babe.I totally fancied her throughout the whole movie,because she appeared in a number of sexy,scintillating outfits and costumes.It just goes to show as a hard bitten woman detective and object of male desire,it's getting more of a woman's world by the minute(I was actually thinking of putting this in the one line summary).I was also suprised by the style of music.Considering this is from the director of Die Hard,this seemed paced more in the style of a movie like Sabrina in the way it was told and filmed. I was pretty impressed with the seduction dance scene in the middle, which lead to active rumpy pumpy between the 2 leads as well.Now,some bad-uns.Pierce Brosnan seemed to be thinking he was playing James Bond all over again.He was his usual handsome,well spoken leading man,but their was'nt as much conviction as there could have been.And the movie seemed to lack a real sense of rhythem or rhyme. It was'nt incoherent or anything,it just did'nt seem to posess much pace.Also,there was a dangerous lack of conviction or sense of danger when the painting was stolen,thus the movie emerged as ineffective in a way.There was also little logic when you thought of Russo's charecter being in those costumes on such a substantiated wage.I would'nt put anyone off seeing this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but the original is better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie a couple of weeks ago. Overall it wasn't bad. It was a pretty good movie, however it was almost completely different from the 1968 Steve McQueen version. In other words they were two good movies who shared the same name and characters. There were only a few connections between the two. Faye Dunaway, from the original version, does a cameo as Pierce Brosnan's shrink. Throughout the movie you hear different versions of "Windmills of Your Mind", the theme song for the original. All in all not a bad movie, but I suggest you rent the original if you haven't already seen it. I'd give the remake a 6.5 out of 10 (because the movie was also spoiled by making you watch Rene Russo dancing in a see-through dress and then having sex with Pierce Brosnan. Not a movie to take your kids to).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brittle Grade of Steele</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is this a worthy remake of the McQueen/Dunaway film? I can't say; I haven't seen that one. Is it a new film classic? Probably not. But is it a reasonably entertaining high-class caper picture? Definitely.Pierce Brosnan is as elegant and charming as ever as Thomas Crown, though one could wish for a bit more of the impish mischievousness that came through on the Remington Steele series of old. Rene Russo is attractive and clever as Catherine Banning, the high-powered insurance investigator recruited to look into a daring and dramatic museum theft. No one else makes much of an impression -- with the odd exception that the police detective loosely partnered with Banning reminds one of Remington Steele's sometime nemesis, LAPD's Inspector Jarvis.When the film is concentrating on the art thefts, it's crisp and ingenious, though not entirely unpredictable. Elsewhere, it sometimes falters. The sexual chemistry between Crown and Banning is only about 60% "there" -- one can see the attraction, but not quite understand why it's working. And the core characters are not as well-defined as they should be, especially Russo's Banning -- a flaw in the script rather than in the actors' performances.All in all, it's a fairly lively and watchable picture, but it doesn't realize its full potential either as a caper movie or as a Brosnan vehicle. The Bond movies have given Brosnan a good chance to show his "edge"; what's been left largely unexploited is his talent for romantic comedy. The Thomas Crown Affair doesn't give viewers enough of this lighter Brosnan; hopefully, future ventures will do more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suave rich guy meets his match with a sexy insurance agent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a pleasant surprise. Pierce Brosnan was pitched in a role that could be viewed similar to his 007 character, but he played it more than that. His character carried the same cockiness and suaveness, but was deeper and more complex. He made you wonder after a few compromising scenes if he was an appropriate bad guy to root for, which he was by the end. Rene Russo still looking as hot as ever. The fact that she did some nudity in this film, her first time I believe, was a surprise and not necessary I felt. It really didn't contribute to the plot and she was able to be sexy without going topless. Even still after some of her other sexy roles where nudity would've suited her better, I really can't complain on what she showed on screen. She has a great body! Denis Leary did a good job as the detective and is beginning to carry himself well as a good actor in Hollywood. Just like Rene said to him towards the end, "You're a good man." You could look at his character that he portray and actually believe it. Overall, I give the movie a good rating. The story was well thought out and played well by the actors. Not bad at all.</fullReview>

Frankly, I think that Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway in the original generated more heat fully-clothed, with one kiss (AND WHAT A KISS!!!), than Russo and Brosnan did buck naked, rolling around on staircases and desks. The mindboggles at what McQueen and Dunaway could do in a love scene in these more liberal and explicit filmmaking times. Maybe it's just a matter of chemistry. M &amp; D had it.

		<shortDescription>Nothing Special.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Thomas Crown Affair", despite appearances from the trailer, is not a James Bond type movie. It is more of a love story that serves more as eye candy to Brosnan fans than anything else. Brosnan plays a tycoon who makes it a hobby to steal fine art. His latest snag, a rare Monet worth over $100 million, makes him the subject of one of cinematic history's most absurd police investigations. A flashy insurance worker (Rene Russo) decided to infiltrate his life and get back the Monet (her incentive is a percentage of it's value). What develops is a semi-fake romance that turns real as time goes on. All through it, Brosnan is well aware of who she works for, what her intentions really are, and the police that are following him.Entertaining in parts, slow and shallow in others. Brosnan plays a role tailor made for him, as the slick and suave ladykiller, I am wondering if that is the only role he can play well. Russo doesn't turn in one of her better performances, and frankly, Dennis Leary doesn't make himself useful. Whatever suspense there is is confined to the first and last 20 minutes. The time in between is between Brosnan and Russo. There are a few good moments here and there, but as a whole, this movie is very insubstantial and unmoving. Rent "Tomorrow Never Dies" instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thomas Crown Affair - A review...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Do you think you own the building?" Imagine for a minute that you did indeed own the building. With your money you can have anything. A New York mansion full of priceless works of art. Your own private plane, its sole purpose to lift your own private glider into the air. Why the glider? To carry you to your second home in the Carribean, of course. When the thrill of destroying $100,000 sail boats, merely because you like the splash that they make, is gone, what can you do to bring excitement into your life?While most of us dream for such problems, Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) is one billionaire who is beginning to live them. Crown decides to fulfill his sense of adventure and alleviate his boredom by "relieving" a New York Art Museum of one of its $100-million Monet. The crime is seemingly untraceable, leaving the police, headed by Detective Michael McCann (Denis Leary) with few clues and no leads.But only until Catherine Banning (Rene Russo) arrives on the scene as an insurance investigator whose job it is to help recover the painting so her company does not have to write a $100-million check to the museum. She immediately begins picking up on clues, but only after her morning cup of green goo - some mixture which seems to be a cross between a lime-kiwi milkshake and the slime which created a certain foursome of talking turtles in the late '80s.She first sees Crown as he gives his witness testimony, and is instantly sure that he is the thief. It does not take her long to confront Crown with an only slightly veiled accusation, which is answered by an equally veiled confession - but no proof is available. Thus begin the mind games which pervade the remainder of the movie.Director John McTiernan (Die Hard, The Hunt for Red October, Medicine Man) did a superb job of enhancing this psychological thriller with just enough action, romance, and comedic bantering to satisfy, without going overboard by ruining the movie's main purpose. The story shifts between each of these moments relatively seamlessly, employing an unusual method: Based on Alan Trustman's story, the screen play employed two writers.Kurt Wimmer (Sphere) penned the high-action, quick moving heist scenes, while Leslie Dixon (Mrs. Doubtfire, Look Who's Talking Now) gave us much of the carefully worded verbal bantering, as well as scripting the few scenes in which it becomes clear that Crown and Banning have progressed past a purely professional relationship, though that staircase could not have been very comfortable. The cinematography was especially well done during a dance scene - the strength of will of each character is so apparent that it can be seen in their faces.Pierce Brosnan (Tomorrow Never Dies, Dante's Peak, Mars Attacks!) brought Crown to life as he was meant to be; a smug rich man who is used to getting his way. More than that, he is smooth and debonaire, every bit as in control as James Bond ever was. Brosnan's earlier roles definitely influenced his portrayal of Crown, but he did not get carried away. Crown was clearly a businessman, not a secret agent, though little happened which he did not want to happen.Banning was also used to being in control of every situation, and Rene Russo (Lethal Weapon 3 &amp; 4, Tin Cup, Outbreak) made sure that the audience knew this. From her sincere facial expressions and body language, to her often brash and straightforward dialogue, Russo more than held her own. Crown may have stolen the painting, but Russo stole the show.Rounding out the starring cast is Denis Leary (Wag the Dog, Suicide Kings, Demolition Man), filling the shoes of one of NYPD's finest, Detective Michael McCann. McCann suddenly finds himself both outmatched and left in the dark. Leary's detective's visible frustration, confusion, and general lack of control perfectly complemented his co-stars' absolute mastery of every situation.Even Faye Dunaway (the original Thomas Crown Affair, Don Juan DeMarco, The Chamber) as Crown's Psychiatrist does her part, revealing much of Crown's internal turmoil. Though in a minor role this time, it was nice to see a familiar face from the original movie of 1968.Perhaps this year's remake did not outshine its 1968 predecessor, but few remakes manage to. Regardless, Brosnan's second attempt at producing was a successful one. The plot is thought provoking, and contains enough twists to remain intriguing throughout, yet leaves few loose ends by the end.One loose end is Banning's green sludge, which never is identified. That's more than we can say for the rather blatant product endorsements which seem to pop up at random times. What *WAS* a big Lucent banner doing plastered across the sail of an otherwise unmarked boat?Still, The Thomas Crown Affair was a welcome relief from the recent onslaught of horror and suspense thrillers. Yes, the special effects are great, but how many times can you pay $8.25 for visual candy which is gone by the time the credits roll? When you are ready for something different, The Thoms Crown Affair promises and delivers both a plausible and well written story and great acting by some of the best.</fullReview>

I would recommend this film to anyone who has a love for films that just make you feel good about life, This film revolves around a non violent plot, its a very calm movie, worth your while, and your eight bucks!

		<shortDescription>Style over substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie sure LOOKS good, but except for the two very clever art heists -- one in Act One, the other in Act Three -- the story is ultra-slow paced and plodding. From a story standpoint, the problem can be traced to the fact that both the lead characters -- Crown and Banning -- have figured each other out by the end of their first meeting. So where's the suspense? (Granted, there's one nice character revelation in Act Three, but it's a case of too little, too late.)Most potential audience members will have never seen the original Steve McQueen/Faye Dunaway version, so comparisons are pointless. The real question is, does this version stand on its own terms? Yes, it stands, but its legs are very shaky. It's yet one more example of style over substance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You have to be cheered by the gestalt of the whole thing--a return to the days when the sensual pleasures in a middlebrow thriller were expensive hairdos, ageless bottles of Cabernet Sauvignon, and a roomful of restful Monets waiting for the picking. That's as opposed to asteroids, orange fireballs, deafening sounds of glass shattering in a skyscraper. The script of this remake of Norman Jewison's jazzy, modish thriller is a doozy: it keeps you guessing on about four different levels about the game of trust-or-not-to-trust played by a bored billionaire art thief (Pierce Brosnan) and the insurance-company hottie (Rene Russo) who's on his trail.But the director, John McTiernan, doesn't have the style for this journey into swank; he comes across like a middle-management meatball dressed up as an oil heir. And the leads don't make it any easier. Brosnan, though frighteningly, almost preeningly gaunt, looks right, but hasn't got the charm to get you over the character's speed bumps--like selling out his criminal employees and making them face stiff time. And Russo is costumed and lighted to seem like an overbearing drag queen. (McTiernan often showcases the ugly, expensive costumes in static, full-frontal shots that tend to induce wincing.) Neither of them has the personality to make the game both sexy and gripping. Everybody involved in the movie (except the canny writers) seems, as they say, undercast.One distinction: The movie builds to a brilliant, chilling, O. Henry-style finale--then, in what is surely a post-test-screening "adjustment," undoes all that with a slapped-together, dreadful "happy ending" that makes the audience groan. Note to the marketing boys of our city: no more leading questions on those test cards, fellas--the answers can blow up in your face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They dropped the ball half way through...along with the clothes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the movie "The Thomas Crown Affair" last night. I hadn't heard a thing about the movie and went in with no preconceptions. I never saw the original movie. Didn't know it existed. I went just because my friend had heard good things and the movie starred Pierce Brosnan (who I think is absolutely gorgeous. [g])I enjoyed the first half of the movie. There seemed to be two strong, intelligent, and capable characters squaring off. It was shaping up to be a consummate battle between two mental masters. However, I was terribly disappointed by how it played out.First, the girl gets her way only by using sex as a weapon. Message: Girls can't make it on brains alone. They need to distract others with crude and blatant sexual teasing, they have less control than guys and they fall madly in love at the drop of a hat...or any other piece of clothing.Then, you get this overdone, unnecessary sex scene between the two leading characters. Message: as long as you can have amazing sex, you've found true love and commitment. Yeah, right. Whatever. I prefer a battle of wits, not libido. What ever happened to tasteful, graceful, and elegant with the spice of innuendo and implication?Finally, the guy is always one step ahead of the girl! She's the one who gets all emotional and then can't think straight. He's the one who's always in control. He anticipates all her moves but she can't anticipate any of his. Message: Girl's can't keep up with guys. Grumble, grumble.On top of that, I think the whole movie was just an ego trip for Pierce Brosnan.One thing I really liked was following the interplay between the characters and getting inside their heads and understanding their motivations and how they will react. It's an intellectually stimulating and humorous movie (until the clothes start hitting the floor). I much prefer that to simply blowing up several huge items in spectacular red fireballs. I also liked the fact that nobody died or got maimed for once. You need brains to follow this movie, kids. If you're looking for pure adrenaline and visceral reaction, go watch something else.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie...but my interest is peaked for the original. I'll definitely be renting it soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice diversion for an afternoon...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was not a bad film, but also not the film of the year by any stretch of the imagination. Pierce Brosnan plays Thomas Crown, a billionaire who is completely bored with life. As a diversion, he steals a Monet painting worth $100 million from a museum. This results in a cat-and-mouse game with an insurance investigator (Rene Russo).The film certainly has its charm. I never thought a robbery could be so delightful to see on screen, but somehow this movie does it. Brosnan and Russo also have a great deal of chemistry on screen. So, what is wrong?The pacing, for a start. This film is incredibly slow. I am not saying that it should have a few explosions; indeed, it is extremely nice that it didn't. However, a film can be fast paced without incredible amounts of property damage, and this just wasn't.Secondly, the sex scenes somehow manage not to work. Brosnan and Russo steam up the screen while they are fully clothed, but as soon as they take it off and go at it, something is lost and never found again. It feels as though they were put in as filler just so that the audience could see Rene Russo naked.However, the film could have been much worse, all things considered. As it was, it was a pleasant and charming diversion for an afternoon. 3.5/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting at times, slow in others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning, may be some tiny spoilers:What I've always liked about films like this is that you can have fun with the wealth that is on screen. The kind of wealth that is reserved for the likes of Bill Gates or Donald Trump, yet they lack what Mr. Crown has, the looks and the cahrm to be a true playboy. How many of us would love to have an infinite supply of money to go around so that we can wreck a boat if we feel like it just because we enjoy the thrill of the ride? It is small moments like this that are fun. Most of us will never know what it is like to make 30 million dollars in one business acquisition or what it is like to be chauffered around in a Mercedes and then flying off to some exotic island and spend the night at your own private beach house with a beautiful naked woman. So living vicariously through the characters in this movie is half the fun. And fun the movie is. It is not a great movie but it is not boring either.Thomas Crown is a wealthy finance guy in the business world and he also collects fine art. When he sees his opportunity to steal one of the most expensive pieces at the local art museum, he jumps all over it. His plan is rather brilliant as well. But then we meet Catherine ( Russo ). She is hired by the firm that insures the painting to do a little investigating before they decide to shell out 100 million dollars. And it is here that the movie fails. Not so much that it is Russo playing the part, but how the part is written. The character here is a little too head strong and she is a little too confident and she figures things out a little too quickly and she has all the answers a little too quickly. That is my big problem with film. I found that Russo's character to be not believable and seeing as she is one of the two major characters in the film, that possesses a problem. When you can't like one of your stars then the rest of the film has a damper put on it. There are also a few scenes that I found to be much to silly for the Thomas Crown character. Some of what he does is just plain dumb and even though you get to understand that he likes a challenge more than anything in life, I just don't buy the fact that he would reveal some of the things that he does. Also a complete waste in here was the Faye Dunaway character. Her role is useless and it feels like they just put it into the film so they could have an original actor from the first film.But what is fun is some of the cat and mouse that ensues. Catherine is so sure that Crown has the painting that she becomes obsessed with finding out, and in the process she jeapordizes her career, not that you would know that judging by her carefree attitude. Some of what she does in here she would never get away with in real life. All in all, the film had a good beginning, a terrific end but the middle was lacking. It was sometimes boring and slow. But it still worth seeing. And the final conclusion of how he gets himself out of or into more trouble is really quite smartly written. See this film during a matinee and try to enjoy it for what it is, and that is a look into a life that none of us will probably ever have. But it sure is fun to pretend.</fullReview>

In the end though, the museum parts of this are really the only scenes that kept me interested ... the original theft at the beginning of the flick, and another part near the end. But the "love story" between the two main characters left me bored. I didn't buy their mutual infatuation, and was thus unconcerned by whether or not they'd ever get it together. All in all it's entertaining enough for a matinee, but I'd have been upset if I'd paid full fare on this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We went to see The Thomas Crown Affair Saturday night in a packed theater in South Bend, Indiana. Two things were remarkable about that - there are few times that theaters are packed in South Bend and the average age of the audience was probably 48. Everyone seemed to leave happy. This is a smart film for grown-ups. Not quite as smart as "As Good as It Gets", but it was a nice way to spend the evening. I liked all the little twists and jokes, from the Etruscan horse onward. I liked some of the changes from the original - the art heist instead of money (why would a guy like this find taking money any challenge?) The set design was very good. It is a nice movie to look at. Acting. Loved the scenes between Brosnan and Dunaway. No complaints about acting in general. For fans of the original - this is a different Thomas Crown, don't look for McQueen and you will be happy with the Crown that Brosnan presents (a little more character development, done in a more subtle way would have been nice). It is also a sexier movie than the highly anticipated "Eyes Wide Shut". I had forgotten that you can do this in a movie without the pre-teen leer and jiggle. My only criticism are the overlong glider and cat sequences, probably done in honor of the interminable dune buggy sequence in the original. It didn't help move the plot or set much tone. All in all, this is a movie worth seeing and moviegoers over 30 should not wait for video - let MGM know that counterprogramming for grown-ups is a worthy niche market.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An all too rare, superior remake of a fine film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Typically, filmmakers who do remakes are not up to the task. There are a few exceptions and most of us who love movies can come up with one or two. With rare exception, the remake is simply inferior; not so for the 1999 Thomas Crown Affair. This was done with the assurance of at least equal casting, fine writing, superb direction and beautiful production. While it salutes the 1968 original Norman Jewison version it generally surpasses it in both characterizations, denouement and the psychological spirals for which the story is known. The single spot where the producers seemed to have stepped on their own toes is their struggle with the Academy Award winning song of the original, WINDMILLS OF YOUR MIND. Here, Sting and the producers drop the ball. My choice would have been to use it, beautifully, as in the original or leave it out completely and replace it with something, hopefully just as good. Certainly, the budget was there for something else. Instead, the original song is soundly trashed in this version. Is the film worth your time and money? Most assuredly so. The beauty of this is that you could enjoy the original in the morning and still luxuriate in this new version in the afternoon. This is Hollywood fairy tale spinning at its very best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ending to this film was pretty clever, but this can't make up for the over indulgent sex scenes, the "boy, being rich is fun" scenes, and other various annoyances (like, why do we need a black cop and a white detective when both are irrelevant to the plot? How about just one, and let's NOT make the stereotypical casting choice.)Either way, it's a big crowd pleaser. Lots of laughing (in a good way) near the end, and applause when the credits rolled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thomas Crown Affair is an excellent remake of a cult classic. Pierce Brosnan and Renee Russo give good performances in this tricky plot thriller. Faye Dunaway was good natured enough to provide a small cameo relating the latter to the former. Renee Russo has taken the step from a supporting star to full fledged sex symbol. This movie is one of the best of the summer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot has been written, in this forum and in others, about remakes, and people probably feel the same way about them as they feel about cover versions of favorite songs. Though I'm with the stereotype of the film lover in a lot of ways (I hate sequels, hate colorizing movies, prefer subtitles to dubbing), I must admit I have nothing intrinsically against remakes. One of my favorite movies of all time, NO WAY OUT (the Kevin Costner movie, not the Richard Widmark movie), is a remake (of THE BIG CLOCK). And I've seen a handful of good ones over the years (I don't count remakes of foreign language movies because the chances are usually slim that I'd get to see the original).All of this, I guess, is a roundabout way of saying I enjoyed this version of THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR, which is a remake of the famous 1968 version directed by Norman Jewison and starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway. I must admit I don't think the original was a classic. Not to say I hated it, since I liked Steve McQueen, I liked the cinematic tricks Jewison used (like the split screens), and I liked the song "Windmills of Your Mind" (and I'm not a fan of Alan and Marilyn Bergman, two of the songwriters). But I caught the strain at times, and while Faye Dunaway is good in the right role (CHINATOWN, NETWORK), her character was way underwritten, and she was forced to act girlish, which is not her best mode. So ultimately, I found it okay but forgettable.Now the remake. Pierce Brosnan, I must admit, suffers in comparison to Steve McQueen. He's got a movie star presence, and he effectively communicates the joy he gets out of high risk activities, like the boat racing and the airplane flying. But McQueen showed you the boredom which led Crown to pull his heist, and Brosnan doesn't. And McQueen has more depth to him than Brosnan does, so the strong, silent thing works for him better(although Brosnan's scenes with Dunaway, who plays his psychiatrist, are fun, you know it's a plot device to show the feelings Brosnan can't quite access).On the other hand, the remake does improve on the original in some substantial ways. As I said, I liked Jewison's direction there, but director John McTiernan makes it even sleeker and tighter here. When people mention McTiernan, they usually mention he's the director of two of the DIE HARD movies. More appropriate to this discussion, however, is THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, another film he directed with a slick polish. There, I thought it clashed with the good straightforward story and the fine acting, but here, it buttresses the story and the acting. There isn't a wasted moment here, and the two heist sequences are quite cleverly done. Also, while I don't really remember the detectives in the first one, Denis Leary is quite good as the detective here. As in his best work(THE REF, WAG THE DOG), he's able to be Denis Leary within the context of the character, and I liked the fact that even though he played by the rules, he wasn't a clod.But the real improvement comes in the form of Rene Russo. As I said before, when Dunaway played the insurance investigator, there really wasn't much for her to work with. Here, Russo is shown thinking with her brain, and not just her hormones. And instead of acting girlish, Russo acts sexy in a very adult way, which is refreshing in this day and age. And while, as I said, I had problems with Brosnan's performance, I think Brosnan the producer was smart enough knowing a good thing when he saw one and allowing Russo to steal the movie from him(I would like to know what that stuff she was drinking, though).In a summer full of disappointments from the major studios, this was a nice surprise. If all studio movies were as much fun as this, Hollywood wouldn't be in the trouble it's in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't entirely sure what to think when I first saw the commercials for this movie. The first thought was that it was a variation on another 'thief' movie that came out earlier this year - Entrapment. As a result of this attitude, I did not have high expectations. I was very wrong.The plot revolves around a very wealthy business man, Thomas Crown (Brosnan). Like Entrapment, the main character, Crown, steals art more for personal enjoyment than for money. On his latest 'acquisition', an attractive insurance agent, Catherine Banning (Russo), is brought in to find and return the missing painting. Much to the surprise of Crown, he finds that he has met his match in both intelligence and cunning and what ensues is a very smart storyline. I will not reveal much more than this as it will definitely ruin the ending of the movie.From the very beginning, it was obvious this was going to be a very stylish movie. Usually they are if Pierce Brosnan is in it but this movie seemed to take it to another level. There was an unusually large amount of musical accompaniment but it was not your conventional mainstream music. Rather it had a more artsy, jazzy contemporary feel to it, which in the overall theme of the movie, fit in very well. It gave a subtle snobish feel to it and by the end of the movie, there was a line by Denis Leary that seemed to sum it up very well. I won't tell you the line here but you will recognize it when you hear it. There were some parts where the music was a little unusual and slightly distracted from the movie but in general, it was an unusual but very effective choice.Another effective but subtle artistic choice was the vibrant colors used in this movie. In a way, it mirrored the colors used in the art being stolen and I thought worked out very well. Brosnan played his usual dapper, charming Bondish character very well. Rene Russo, however, stepped out of her tomboy type character and played a more sophisticated, feminine but cunning role. Unlike many of her other movies, she wore a dress in much of this one and instead of trading punches with her foe, she matches wits. Her performance was very well done and in some cases, she steals scenes from Brosnan. One other character that was very well done was the role of detective Michael McCann, by Denis Leary. He has proven again that he can make the transition from comedian to actor and I don't think it will be long before you see him in more prominent roles.There were a few rough spots that I did notice though. The beginning is a little confusing but it does become clear later on. In addition, there was a little bit of shameless advertising. In one case, Russo's character picks up a can of Pepsi and very clearly rotates it so that the logo is visible to the audience. There were a few other instances but this one was the most obvious. The story does slow down a bit in the middle but picks up again at the end.Despite those little bumps, I found this movie to be incredibly intelligent. The ending was absolutely brilliant. For any of you who enjoyed Entrapment, you will find this one even more enjoyable. Overall, I think this was one of the better movies of the summer. It makes you think and in some cases, definately surprises you with it's plot twists....9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't want to jinx this movie, but this is this year's Out Of Sight (and I hope it makes the B.O. that Out Of Sight deserved to make). It is one of the most stylish, smart and sexy movies I've ever seen. Pierce Brosnan's role as Crown unavoidably has some Bondish trappings but this works as a plus rather than a minus. Brosnan is virtually perfect in the role. Denis Leary has just the right edge as the cop whose job it is to catch him, but despite these two winning performances the movie belongs to Rene Russo. For the last few years she has been one of the most enjoyable actresses to watch due to her ability to carry off toughness with a smile. Here she moves up several levels in her craft as she intertwines real sizzle with a steel will. I hope Oscar does not overlook her work in this one because she is an early and deserving contender for lead actress. And what about John McTiernan? This guy directed Die Hard, Predator (which was much better than it had any right to be) and The Hunt For Red October then slipped almost totally from memory. Now with this one he is back on the A-List with a bullet (something this movie refreshingly lacks by the way). This movie soars on charm, plotting and style. It knows exactly when to cut from one scene to another. It never drags and it looks great. I'm too young to remember the original movie so this was all new material to me. I'm sure if you look very closely at it the plot comes apart, but I don't care to because I was enjoying the ride too much. Obviously I was taken by complete surprise by this movie. Congratulations to all involved with the making of this movie. I'll be talking it up at work tomorrow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gentleman Thief Movie At Its Epitome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR. John McTiernan's "The Thomas Crown Affair" shows the gentleman thief movie at its true epitome. The film is enjoyable, slick, and sometimes amusing; the lead character also has the same three qualities.Thomas Crown (played by Pierce Brosnan) is "a millionaire with everything." Just for kicks, he decides to steal a Monet painting worth one hundred million dollars. His obstacle: Catherine Banning (Rene Russo), a beautiful insurance investigator who loves the chase her job allows her to pursue. A seductive game of cat-and-mouse ensues, and it's a worthy guessing game as to which one of the two leads is one step ahead in the race.The summer of 1999 began and ends with two enjoyable gentleman thief movies. "Entrapment," with Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones, was perhaps more exciting than "The Thomas Crown Affair," but the latter entry offers more romance and a tighter plot. Rated R. ***1/2 (out of ****)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, I enjoyed the movie. Brosnan is a classy actor, and this comes through. He comes across as devilish and clever. Russo's laugh drove my wife crazy - it's a bit overdone and piercing at times. Also, I don't think she was the ideal pick - just didn't fit the role as someone else might have - seemed like trying to put a round peg into a square hole. The wardrobe people could have done a better job - Brosnan's attire was a bit boring at times - too many solid blue shirts - the only variation was white - boring. The final scene at the gallery was quite clever and highly unpredictable. I'd say it's worth seeing, but don't expect to see anything as good as the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Close, but just missed the mark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thomas Crown Affair was one of those movies that you see the preview of and think blah, but it does surprise. The first theft of the painting was very well done, but a little too slow for the opening sequence of the movie. It took too long to set up and the payoff was in the previews so it lacked a little bit. The next hour was good, but a little slow and a little too commercial. Pepsi, Lucent, and Apple were all over this movie and it was not hidden well. For someone who drinks green gunk every morning, Russo sure did gulp that Pepsi One quite fast. What is not seen is the reason why the movie is rated R. I can put up with a little bit of nudity, but that was a little much. I don't know about you, but I rarely see a woman walking around my house without a top on. The rest of the movie is a little confusing, but fast pace and the ending is the big payoff. It is the one part of the movie that I didn't predict (part of it at least). I won't ruin it for all of those who chose to see this flick.For me, this movie was a little bit too slow in certain parts. It isn't that I don't like slower movies, but I went into this movie thinking it would be a 007 rip-off movie. I mean they even got Brosnan to appear in it, but this movie stands out on its own. I have not seen the original and after seeing this, I'm not really sure I want to. I do know that the first one is about a bank robbing rich guy and that seems a little too low-brow for me. The art theft is more romantic and it really fits in with the flow of the movie. If there is one thing in this movie that was almost flawless it was the music. Each scene got just the right style of music and at the same time, it avoided the fast paced violins that you normally hear during these types of movies. It changed it into a lighter more comical tone because that is what this movie really was. It was a romantic comedy in the disguise of an action movie. You still get the action, but you also get the romance at the same time with just the right amount of humor. I think that if you lost the commercial endorsements and the bare-chested Russo, you would have had a better PG-rated movie.Overall, I give this movie a solid 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

I watched the original a few days afterward, and with the exception of Yaphet Koto's stunning cool, the '68 version has nothing on the '99 vintage.

		<fullReview>Never having seen the original, I went into this one without any preconceptions. There are 2 things I liked about this film: the beginning and the end. In-between was about 1-1/2 hours of a clich卜 attempt at an erotic thriller. Pierce Brosnan gets an "A" for effort when trying to create chemistry with Rene Russo, but she just looks so god-awful *bad* in her close-ups that we can't imagine why in the world Brosnan's dashing billionaire character would find her physically appealing, let alone give chase. Sharon Stone or Catherine Zeta-Jones would have been much better (and more believable) in the role. The art heist at the beginning starts out predictably, then throws in a nice twist. The end similarly has a nice twist of its own, but about halfway through the film I figured out where the stolen painting had been hidden. It wasn't hard -- after all, I had nothing else to do while watching the mechanical cat-and-mouse game between the two leads. All in all, it makes me want to see the original to see how it compares. Finally, Faye Dunaway's character is completely unnecessary and just bogs down the plot. The filmmakers' attempt to be "cute" with her cameo appearance is fine, but then they beat a dead horse. At most, she should have been seen in bookends at the beginning and the end, instead of randomly thrown in throughout the film to no benefit of the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The better art theft film of the summer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thomas Crown Affair: Billionaire financier Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) combines his a penchant for adventure and fine art and indulges in a little larceny. As a result of his escapades - the liberation of a Renoir from the New York Museum of art - Crown meets his soulmate, one Catherine Banning (Rene Russo) an artworld bounty hunter sent to retrieve the painting. What follows is a game of cat and mouse, where we're not really sure who is hunting whom. The second art intrigue film of the summer, The Thomas Crown Affair has the advantage of a better storyline (so good they did a remake) and better acting. While "Entrapment" boasted great locales, "Crown" is more engaging and subtle (the heist is brilliant in it's simplicity). In addition, "Crown" delivers one of the hottest, sweatiest sex scenes I've seen in a long while ("Eyes Wide Shut" should hang its head in shame)Brosnan is his typical suave self and displays a greater range of emotion than we are accustomed to, actually laughing, and losing his cool, whereas Russo's gutsy the-ends-justify-the-means character is reminiscent of her role in Lethal Weapon 3. There is obvious chemistry between the two (something clearing missing between Connery and Zeta-Jones) which gives this film the edge over "Entrapment".Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though this film has a lack of action, which is surprising for director John McTiernan (Die Hard, Predator), and an excess of Pierce Brosnan's aft portions, it was a pleasant surprise and held my interest throughout. It focuses mainly on the romance between Thomas Crown, billionaire art thief and CEO of Crown Acquisitions, and the insurance agent sent to retrieve his most recent "acquisition." The movie does have a few action scenes with some nifty gadgets that I definitely would have liked to see more of, due to their masterful execution and very high coolness factor.

		<shortDescription>A wonderful remake of a great film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway were cautious and charming each other over 30 years ago, is what was one of the best heist film of all time called THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR. It was not only a great suspense film, but also a very entertaining romance film, as both sides of the law were playing with each others minds, and at the same time would fall in love. Now instead of McQueen and Dunaway, it's Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo charming each other in the remake of the Norman Jewison film. And surprising, I put this film with Martin Scorsese's 1991 CAPE FEAR as one of the best remakes of all-time. This is a very entertaining and enjoyable thriller that works on so many levels. The plot has muli-millionare Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) who is rich, wealthy, and living very well off, who decides to rob a Monette painting that's worth over $100 million dollars. After the painting is stolen, a New York City police detective, Michael McCann (Dennis Leary, sporting a Wojo from BARNEY MILLER haircut), and a intellegent and sexy insurance investigator, Catherine Banning (Rene Russo) set out to see who did take the expensive painting. It isn't long when Banning finds out who did take the painting, she's just waiting for the thief to either admit it or until she get's the painting herself. From there on is a romantic game similar to chess of a couple playing with each other's minds, and falling in love with each other. But there's a catch, who could they trust and who's telling the truth? I was very surprised on how well this version was done. It's what ENTRAPMENT should have been: funny, charming, witty, suspensful, and romantic. Brosnan and Russo have excellent chemistry together, and they make a great couple. Brosnan is playing a role similar to James Bond, except that he's on the wrong side of the law this time. But there's nothing wrong with that, it's always fun to see Brosnan playing that kind of role. And I have never seen Russo so sexy, and act so well since GET SHORTY. This was a great role for her, she isn't just a sex object, she throws out witty one-liners and comments that makes her character more enjoyable. The story and pacing of the film is also very good. There are very clever heist scenes, and there are plenty of excellent plot twists that make this a very exciting film to watch. And fans of the original film (like me) will notice the nice homages director John McTiernan shows towards the original film. First there's the casting of Faye Dunaway playing Thomas Crown's psychiatrist. And then there is a updated version of the Alan &amp; Marilyn Bergman and Michel Legrand Oscar winning song, "Windmills of Your Mind" played throughout the film. This is one of the best movies of the summer, and I personally feel that it should make more money than ENTRAPMENT did. I just hope that people will actually get up and see a entertaining suspense/thriller, instead of a silly thriller like THE HAUNTING. Please go see this film! ****1/2 (out of five)</fullReview>

One of the rare occasions where a remake is better than the original and the original was pretty good but not nearly as intricate nor did it have the delicious suprises of the new one. My only criticism and its a small one Rene Russo is not as sexy or seductive as a young Faye Dunaway but she is equally convincing as the determined insurance investigator. What a breath of fresh air to see a terrific summer entertainment film without mindless over the top action sequences and special effects.

		<fullReview>While I thought "Entrapment" was a good movie, "The Thomas Crowne Affair" is far more entertaining. Both feature similar plots (wealthy, debonair art thief and a gorgeous insurance investigator play a game of cat-and-mouse), but all-in-all this movie was much better. Rather than relying on cool gadgetry and spandex, "Crowne" relies more on the on-screen chemistry between Rene Russo and Pierce Brosnan (quite effectively, I might add). You leave the movie feeling as if James Bond suddenly decided to go crooked. And yes, there are some cool gadgets but they aren't featured so prominently that you think the movie is about them. Go see this moive, you won't be disappointed. Oh, and Rene Russo is naked in like 5 scenes, so all you guys out there will be stoked (i know i was.. hee hee)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sneak preview, 1999-07-24 19:00 PDT, Edwards, AlhambraPierce Brosnan stars in the title role of the second art thief movie of the year, making it a match of the first versus the last Bond in that regard, I suppose.And I must say the most recent one is the better, both on the plot and on the charm side, and fortunately, the stories differ, too.Thomas Crown is a successful businessman in New York (in finance, obviously), who loves to go to the museum and watch a particular painting, featuring some haystacks that appear to touch his mind. He takes delight in outsmarting those who like to outsmart him, of course, and apparently trust is something purely personal (or as he himself says it: "I trust myself inherently").Although one could say that the movie isn't particularly original, not in its theme or in its treatment of it, there isn't anything particularly bad with the way it's done. There are a few small mysteries, a few good lines, a few sex scenes, some romance, some action, and some style. But most of all it is amusing in its own, peculiar way.In general, the movie is worthwhile watching, and you don't have to be a Pierce Brosnan fan to enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although not quite as good as the original, "The Thomas Crown Affair" is an exciting addition to the summer schedule for 1999. I saw it at a sneak preview and will see it again upon regular release; don't miss it! Rene Russo is stylish and sexy at 45, and does a better job than Faye Dunaway did 31 years ago. But of course Brosnan can't match Steve McQueen. Several plot changes from the original keep the fun flowing throughout the film. Music is great as expected from the '68 standards, with a better version of "Windmills Of Your Mind" by Sting. Enjoyable all the way through, with 3 exceptions: dance scene left out what could have been a fast paced, intense innuendo; it didn't adapt the "comic-strip" views from the original; and the last 2 mins or so. But almost all others will disagree with me on that last one I can guarantee. Overall, a great crowd-pleaser.1999 version: 0-91-100 or "A" or ****.1968 version: 0-96-100 or "A+" or ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever, edgy, fast-paced caper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pacing, glamor and some wonderful twists make this caper film highly enjoyable. Rene Russo is not an obvious choice to play a high-vamp art detective, and her character's messy hair (wig?)style is weirdly distracting, but against expectations, she occupies the role believably, and delivers certain lines with memorable panache. Pierce Brosnan, always a short step away from self-parody (perhaps a hang-over from James Bond), nevertheless plays the title role of master-financier-and-possible-art-thief Thomas Crown with exactly the right degree of casual menace. Surprisingly, the Brosnan/Russo pairing works, and a couple of their sexy scenes generate real heat.The storyline neatly balances suspense and playfulness, and delivers several supremely funny moments. The film moves quickly - dialog is snappy, and pacing is brisk and effective. Throughout, the look of the film is lush - beautiful people, clothes, artwork, all expensively and attractively presented. In a sly wink at her leading role in the 1968 version, Faye Dunaway has a small but central role as a shrink with a sense of humor.In light of all these pluses, it would be churlish to note that the plot is thoroughly outlandish and cannot be parsed. But who cares? It's a caper, and works wonderfully as such. I was thoroughly, pleasantly surprised. Go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the original wasn't really worth remaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Norman Jewison's 1968 movie "The Thomas Crown Affair" cannot be considered any kind of masterpiece. True, it was a clever look at embezzlement, containing a cool chess game. But in the grand scheme of things, it seemed to go more for aesthetics than plot (although I will admit that Faye Dunaway looked mighty sexy in those outfits).So why remake it? John McTiernan, known for flicks like "Predator" and "Die Hard", changes the setting from Boston to New York and changes the focus from a bank robbery to an art heist. The roles played by Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway are now played by Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo (with Dunaway co-starring as the psychiatrist, and Denis Leary and Ben Gazzara also appearing).The original, despite its flaws, did manage to create a steamy, tense feeling. The remake just can't compare. They could have at least given it a better ending than they did.Also appearing is columnist Bob Novak, a few years before he infamously outed Valerie Plame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thomas Crown affair is such a rarity among remakes, It's a remake that actually surpass the original. Almost all remakes that come out today have one major flaw; They don't bother to think up a different story they just use the old one and changes somethings around and give it the same title. But with the Thomas Crown Affair that doesn't happen, this movies is a movie all on it's own. It's not a remake or reimaging it's a whole new film with a different style, a different story &amp; a different plot. The Thomas Crown Affair stars Pierce Brosnan as The title character. Thomas Crown is a thrill seeking billionaire who finally decides his world is too safe, so what does he do for fun; he robs one of New York's most highly guarded museum's in broad daylight( Who's got he balls to do that anymore!?). Now he has the painting: but before he can bask in his post heist glory. He has to out smart a beautiful and ruthless insurance investigator by the name of Catherine Banning. But can Crown out smart her or will he get put away for good? The Thomas Crown Affair is a sleek and sexy crime thriller that you can't afford to miss, It's a film steeped in great heist scene and is movie making at it's best. This film is an affair you just don't want to miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watch/listen for the moment when he says that... The main theme of this excellent, hugely entertaining and even inspiring film is The Man and The Woman and their relational chemistry. He is a cool and canning individual bent on doing the impossible and confidently planning to get away with it. She is an experienced and skillful investigator bent on pursuing her target and catching him red-handed. Their relationship is the centerpiece of the cat and mouse thriller captivating the riveted and envious viewers. That's how it was in 1968 with Steven McQueen and Faye Dunaway and the very same thing is happening in the 1999 remake with Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo. But what a delicious difference. It is hard to believe that only 3 decades ago we were considering the Norman Jewison technique of split screens a revolutionary invention and were so impressed with it. I watched the remake first and then wanted to see the original. It was so difficult to get used to the slow pace and lackadaisical (as it seemed) unfolding of the 1968 prototype. Brilliant and precise rhythm of Brosnan's Thomas Crown is almost mesmerizing. Rene Russo is a powerhouse of feminine high voltage energy. The attraction and suspiciousness, fusion and clashes between the two grab you by the gut and pull you in. Great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of remakes in general. This movie was a very stylish and seductive remake of the original. I think this is possibly, my favorite pierce brosnan movie. Rene Russo did a superb job of being strong, sexy and vulnerable at the same time. It was an interesting blend of being sort of a guy flick, but sort of a gal flick at the same time. Without giving any spoilers, I would best describe this movie as one big long seduction. Normally, a plot like that could get tedious, but this was very well done and engaging throughout. This is also not the typical type of movie that I like, but it was so well done, and intellectually stimulating, that I really enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some additional observations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contrary to what was said previously, Faye Dunnaway does in fact add a great deal to the movie but what she adds is extremely subtle. As an example: Anyone remotely understand why Brosnan sets up Russo at the end of the movie? If you think back to Crowne's last appointment with his therapist (Dunnaway), she says something that gets his attention. What she says is that since Russo is just like Crowne the only way he would ever really know if she is serious about him is if she loses what she desires most. Crowne engineers the entire last set up to find out how much Russo really cares about him. This was the only way for a man like him to find out. Dunnaway in essence plays Crowne's inner voice; rather have Crowne talk directly into the camera the director uses his therapist and although the troll is a modest one I think she plays it with a great deal of style and panache</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing - could have been good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to like this film. I like art capers (to catch a thief, to steal a million). I like Pierce Brosnan. I know he's typecast - but I like that suave Cary Grant-esquire elegance. I was very pleased to see an AGE APPROPRIATE couple!It started off interestingly and nearly ended interestingly too. I enjoyed the parts that centered on the theft(s). The "trojan" horse bit was amusing. The twists and trying to figure out who is doing what was amusing. The Magritte references - not only to the amusing Bowler man switch but the reference to Thomas Crown himself were all done well.However the "romance" just didn't work for me. I felt like it was all about Rene Russo's character using her body to solve a case and then (stupidly) falling for a crook. There were multiple gratuitous breast shots (I detracted points just for that). There was an overly pointless long sex segment. The "romance" was just boring and overly clich卜. The dialogue wasn't snappy or interesting. The scenes added nothing to the movie. Also, another point was taken off for the soda product placement by Russo in the station.So if you're bored one day &amp; want to see an "almost" good movie caper movie or you're a fan of either actor, go ahead and rent it - just be prepared for it to not be as good as it could've been.****SPOILER***** BTW, at the end did he steal 2 paintings or just the boats one for her? If he did only steal 1 -why is he leaving the country?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too bad that the start wasn't better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing "The Thomas Crown Affair" I had a double feeling about the movie. The beginning of the movie wasn't really good and most of all very predictable, but in the end it all got a bit better and more interesting to watch.A few Eastern European guys try to rob a museum and get in by copying the idea of the Trojan Horse (I guess everybody knows the ancient Greek legend, but for those who don't: they are smuggled inside the museum in the belly of a gigantic statue of a horse). They do some special burglar stuff, cut some wires, get to the paintings,... but than something goes wrong and they are caught by the police. But even though they were caught, one painting is missing. Of course the police immediately starts an investigation and a mysterious lady, Catherine Olds Banning, suddenly appears. She works for some Swiss insurers and she will monitor the case closely and try to find the thief, because her employers aren't very eager to pay. She soon finds a suspect, Thomas Crown. Thomas Crown is a multi-millionaire and successful playboy with a rare hobby: stealing expensive works of art. He finds himself much too clever for the police, but he is eager to participate in the cat-and-mouse game that Banning, in which he sees a worthy adversary, wants to play with him...My main problem with the movie was the predictability, especially in the beginning. Of course she will do anything to catch him and ignore the rules made up by the police. Of course he'll show off with all his richness and seduce her. Of course she will fall in love with him. I can't really say that such a script is very original or even very clever. It has been done so many times before and will be done even more in the future. However, that doesn't mean that the movie didn't have any clever parts. For instance the part where he wants to return the painting and uses a painting by Ren Magritte, a Belgian surrealist painter, as a source of inspiration is absolutely brilliant.What I also liked was the fact that Pierce Brosnan was casted as the classy, elegant and sophisticated millionaire / playboy. He really played that role very well. The other characters however weren't all that excellent. I wasn't really blown away by the performances of Denis Leary, Rene Russo or Frankie Faison. They stood in Brosnan's shadow from the beginning and never were able to get out of it. In the end this was a quite good, entertaining and fast-paced movie, but far from a masterpiece. It had too many plot holes (for example where does Catherine Olds Banning, immediately after the robbery come from when nobody told her what happened or asked her to come to the museum? She just shows up.) and the acting wasn't always excellent. I give it a 6.5/10, but certainly nothing more than that.</fullReview>

I looked forward to seeing what Brosnan and Russo would do with the story.While neither film is strong on logic [I never understood why clever Crown believed he should flee] the 99 version is slicker, the dance routine is good [but not as good as the chess routine] and the locations are superior but otherwise the 68 version is a better told story with more tension and the romantic element between McQueen and Dunaway is far more credible than that between Brosnan and Russo.Overall the '99 movie is mostly clever with a stupid ending.5/10 average viewing</fullReview>

Poor Pierce Brosnan must have wished he was back in the Bond movies where at least he looks a little more comfortable in the role.Maybe if they had called this movie by another name it may have seemed better than it actually is,and why Ms Dunaway made an appearance here is beyond comprehension-the only saving grace of the movie is her performance.The original had style, charisma, and great acting, this is just plain boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw the movie I wasnt as struck by it. However, it was only when I saw it the next time that I realised how entertaining it was - far superior to the original. There are several great things about the movie - the cast was excellent, I thought. Pierce Brosnan is not the greatest actor in the world - but he has the look which is great for doing caricatures such as `secretive spy' or `suave business man'. Being a caricature isnt necessarily a bad thing - most of Dickens characterizations were highly caricatural and very entertaining. The best wo things about the movie were the soundtrack (which was great) and the plot (the twist with the painting at the end was completely unexpected). But what also made it great was the direction - you can tell that the director is enjoying Crown's plot as much as the man is himself. The last sequence of how Thomas Crown replaces the painting shows a complete enjoyment of its mechanics. the physicality of the moevments and even the presence of the characters from the paintings is relished. It was also a treat to see how rich people live - and not just rich people, but those with good taste.</fullReview>

This was essentially like 'Moonlighting'-you are really there to see Brosnan and Russo joust, nothing more or less. I have seen some Van Gough's and Monet's in person, I can't say that I enjoyed seeing even fakes or prints of theirs' being painted over/burnt/defaced/whatever. That was the one thing here I winced at.But the rest-the main performances, the atmosphere, the plotting-I thought was quite good. I also found it to be kinda nice seeing a couple 45 year olds being seen as falling for each other and not being treated as a pair of 22 year olds instead. Grown ups have sex too? Gee what a concept there Hollywood. Russo is Fine even now.You also get to see Fritz Weaver, Ben Gazzara and Denis O'Leary in some smallish roles, all of them adding to the pic.See this for the caper, the 'jousting' and scenary. Sometimes it gets into travelogue terrain(!) too much, and yeah you don't quite believe all the guys in bowlers thingie at the end-but so what?

The intricate plots that unfolded in the museum never failed to hold my interest. I confess, I haven't seen the 1968 original film, so I can make no comparisons. Fay Dunaway's part was somewhat superfluous, but it seems to be a recent fad for remakes to pay homage to originals by casting the original principals into minor roles in the remake. (Such as the remake of Cape Fear with Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum in small parts.) Rene Russo was beautiful and charismatic in this film, but I haven't heard anything from her since. Denis Leary turned in a solid performance also. The direction was a little distracting a few times, but not enough to hurt the film. Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT This movie had a great beginning, a great ending, and a lot of c**p in between. By `great ending,' by the way, I am referring to the bowler hat scene in which Mr. Crown (Pierce Brosnan) returns to the museum to replace the painting. The closing scene in this film, in which Catherine Banning whispers into Thomas Crown's ear, is one of the most ridiculous closing lines I have heard in a movie in years.Pierce Brosnan plays Thomas Crown, a tremendously wealthy businessman who steals tremendously valuable paintings from high security museums to add to his eccentric collection. One of the best things about this movie is that Brosnan plays the part so well. He just LOOKS rich. He could never play the part of a poor man. When an investigation follows his acquisition of a $100 million dollar painting, one of the more prominent investigators (Russo) tries seduction in order to get Crown to admit something, and ends up falling for him. While I am generally against more elderly actors having rough sex and acting like teenagers in movies, I was able to tolerate it here because at least they were approximately the same age, right? It would have ruined the movie if the part of Catherine Banning had been played by a young actress like Denise Richards (the latest and worst `Bond girl').Anyway, after the highly entertaining scene at the opening of the film in which Crown acquires the painting, you get about an hour and a half of an almost boring criminal investigation mixed with a horribly unlikely love story. Banning finds what she is looking for very early on, but she still decides to just sleep with Thomas Crown for a while longer until she eventually falls for him. However, despite the load of garbage that is sandwiched in the middle of this movie, and the fact that even with the big names it was unable to live up to the original, The Thomas Crown Affair is a quality film. It takes an unlikely story and makes it into a fairly well thought out movie, even though it did resort numerous times to excessive nudity to pull it along. Renee Russo looked surprisingly good for her age, it's just that so much of the nudity in the sex scenes (and on the dance floor, for that matter) was obviously thrown in just to get a reaction. Yes! Renee Russo does get naked in this movie! But who cares? Russo AND Brosnan got naked, but it was all just a gimmick. It's just to get more people to watch the movie. That disappoints me, but I still enjoyed the movie, and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in a good action/drama.or just interested in seeing high priced Hollywood actors take off their clothes.</fullReview>

It's listed here -- look under Yeoh -- and is available as an import from Asian Xpress or Poker Industries. (I wish Amazon carried some of the Hong Kong imports.The Chinese film is not a caper flick as much as it is a romantic comedy built around the investigator's efforts to retrieve the loot -- and around his increasing enthralment with the svelte Michelle. Don't expect a big budget Hollywood movie.

		<fullReview>Why? because its great!Need I say more? I've seen both versions of the Thomas Crown Affair twice and this is new one is far better than the original with Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway. Pierce Brosnan's Thomas Crown is suave and stylish with all the sleekness you'd expect to see from his Bond movies. Rene Russo's plays insurance investigator Catherine Banning with sexy self-confidence. Though the new version is centered more on the romance, the heist sequence remains and is much more ingenius than the original. The Affair is filled with exciting and unexpected plot twists making it a incredibly enjoyable film to watch...even the second time around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I am not perhaps the most impartial viewer for this film, being hopelessly devoted to Pierce Brosnan, I can cheerfully recommend it to anyone.Well, anyone who isn't addicted to MTV and so cannot abide films that don't have a jump-cut every 2.5 seconds. The Thomas Crown Affair is not that sort of film. It *is* an intelligent, mature thriller / romance, and it *is* great fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the film that Entrapment wanted to be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thomas Crown Affair - ***Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) is a billionaire Manhattan playboy who has everything a man could desire - fame, fortune, success, even adventure. The adventure is supplied by Crown's risky leisure interests, which include sailing, gliding, and art theft. The movie opens with an elaborate heist of a priceless Monet from a heavily guarded gallery in New York. It is a long, complex, and wonderful sequence which keeps the audience guessing about its eventual outcome. Enter police detective Michael McCann (Denis Leary) and insurance investigator Catherine Banning (Rene Russo,) who join forces to recover the painting. McCann is quickly frustrated by Banning's tactics, which include approaching Crown and boldly announcing that he is the guilty party. What Banning understands, and McCann does not, is that Crown is basically a bored rich kid in search of a thrill. And what better thrill than to seduce an investigator who knows you are guilty, and will do anything to prove it?If the plot sounds familiar, that's because it is. This story was originally told in the 1968 film of the same name, which starred Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway, directed by Norman Jewison. In that version, however, Thomas Crown was a bank robber. But more likely audiences will be reminded of Entrapment, a film which came out earlier this year starring Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones. It, too, featured a rich art thief and a beautiful insurance investigator who conducted an affair while simultaneously plotting against each other. Of the two recent films, The Thomas Crown Affair is the more effective one. The success of this story depends entirely upon the chemistry between the leads. We must believe that they are truly attracted to each other. We do. After all, who would not be attracted to either Pierce Brosnan or Rene Russo? (And what a wonderful decision to cast the female role in the same age bracket as the leading man. Sadly, this is so rare as to be groundbreaking.) We must also believe that each party in the relationship is capable of swindling, even abandoning, the other. While the attraction between Crown and Banning is evident, both actors maintain enough detachment to make the viewer believe they could each lower the boom on the other at any moment. The relationship is like a chess game, where each participant has hidden agendas that play out in the background while the romance fills the foreground.Unfortunately, the screenplay calls for the Russo character to lose her edge fairly early in the game. Previously a hard-bitten investigator, she eventually degenerates into a lovesick puppy. This softening of her character, coupled with the overly conventional ending that it generates, is the movie's greatest flaw. But along the way, the viewer is treated to a well-made film. The locations are picturesque, from Crown's palatial Manhattan office to his secluded Martinique retreat. And the impeccable wardrobe seems to have been provided primarily by Giorgio Armani. Finally, the movie ends with yet another astounding gallery heist even more daring and original than the first. Robberies aside, however, the thrill of this picture is in wondering which of the lover/competitors will win the game. The disappointment comes when we realize there will be a draw.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally watched this movie and the only comment that could be mustered at the end of it was "there's two hours of my life I won't get back". It really was a poor homage to what was a fine original move (Steve McQueen - Faye Dunaway). To begin with - who told Rene Russo that she can act, let alone carry a move on the strength of her breasts alone. The sex scenes were contrived and totally misplaced in this movie. As well, this is way below what we have come to expect from Pierce Brosnan. Comparatively speaking the man deserves an Oscar for Dante's Peak! And what a waste of Dennis Leary - the role for him seems more of an add-on to get another name as a draw, rather than providing him with even one decent line to say. Please, spare yourself the waste of time and pass this one by!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best romantic pairings in recent years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo are electrifying in this clever romantic thriller. They bring a much-needed maturity to their characters as a businessman/art thief and insurance investigator, respectfully. The movie works on a number of levels, but it is a character-driven film all the way.Thomas Crown is a man who has it all. He's wealthy, and has plenty of time to take off to look at the paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan. But one day, while security is diverted by a Trojan Horse scheme, he walks in and takes a valuable piece of art. The cat-and-mouse game begins.The art-thief story takes a back seat to his ambiguous romance with the insurance investigator who was sent to find it. She knows he took it, and he knows she knows. He even plays games with her. He hands her a covered painting he says is what she's looking for, and she throws it in the fire without even looking.Bottom line, it's all fun and games. The closest thing to an explosion or anything is when three men pop out of a Trojan Horse during the actual theft. When all is said and done, you know everyone has had a great time making this film. It reminded me in a few very elementary ways of the atrocious "Entrapment," only done right for a change.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came into this film with high expectations, as relayed by friends who had seen this movie. Perhaps, if you have never before seen a movie, this hackneyed, over-exposed, 4th-grade plot would amuse you. Each character is about as believable as cardboard cut-outs, the dialogue seems so bad ("Do you want to dance or do you want to DANCE?") that it's painful to realize that Dixon also wrote Mrs. Doubtfire and Pay it Forward. The plot is immensely and inexcusable predictable. So much so, that because you can't imagine that you've guessed the ending within 15 minutes, you'll invent a better and more original movie.The acting is decent, but can Pierce play anything but an exciting, older white male? The only thing he ever seems to do in movies is not react to things. If you always play it cool, is that even acting? Rene Russo gets out of acting by continuously taking off her top, apparently to prove that "older women still got it." This was a big deal when the movie came out, but now it seems distracting, unnecessary and forced.Unless you've never guessed the end to a movie before in your life, stay away from this horrid "Affair."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cold, not cool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, it seems to be a requirement of remakes that one of the stars of the original has to be be given a bit part. That's the only explanation for Faye Dunaway's appearance as a psychiatrist in this updated version of the 1968 Dunaway-Steve McQueen film. Her scenes with Pierce Brosnan add nothing to the plot of the movie. But Dunaway's cameo just reminds us how cool the original movie was, and how cold this one is.Dunaway was one of the coolest actresses of the late '60s-late '70s. And McQueen-there was no one cooler than he. He deliberately chose to be cast against type as a sophisticated millionaire in "Crown," and yet we bought it. And the end of the earlier version was way cool.There's nothing cool about this version. Whatever cool had Brosnan had dissipated after Remington Steele. Russo's cool was used up in "In the Line of Fire" and "Lethal Weapon 3." There is no spark between them in this film, no sense that the two characters really care about each other. And we don't care about either of them-neither of the characters as likeable. Russo starts out wonderfully as a strong, smart insurance investigator, but by the end of the film she has been reduced to an annoying blubberer. The movie ends on a predictable note. Go ahead and rent "The Thomas Crown Affair." Just make sure it's the earlier version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thomas Crown Affair (1999): Dir: John McTieman / Cast: Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo, Denis Leary, Faye Dunaway, Fritz Weaver: Pointless remake that is more soft corn porn than a worthy detective caper that the original film succeeded as. The affair in question regards both the execution of the crime at hand as well as the constant sex. There is lots of sex and sweat and as little plot as possible because the budget went to whoever could orgasm the loudest. Pierce Brosnan plays an art thief and Rene Russo plays the investigator who is suppose to arrest him but her handcuffs are for different purposes. Their relationship lacks chemistry. Brosnan is always leaving his briefcase wherever he stops and Russo guzzles strange drinks. Directed by John McTiernan who under some strange miracle directed two stupid films this year. He is also the proud maker of the blood gutty The 13th Warrior as well. To his credit he displays skill in the film's warped conclusion. Denis Leary is cardboard as Russo's boss. Faye Dunaway appears from the original although her work here is merely a reminder that the original is much better. Not nearly as much plot as there is sex. The original examined the crime and how crafty the anti-hero is but here plot takes second fiddle to dumb sex scenes. Perhaps the film would make better material for sex education than a suspense caper. Score: 3 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film where I enjoyed the first half, but just didn't really get into it with the second half. I guess this is a film that most guys and girls can enjoy to a degree. Because there is something for both genders. There is that cool suave guy Thomas Crown played Pierce Brosnan doing what he does best, except he isn't a MI6 agent this time around. It's mostly what James Bond might do if he ever retired. So he is this rich and clever guy that lives on the edge, while attracting just about any women. And steals expensive art works during his spare time for the rush of it. And on his tail is this smart and articulate female detective who Crown has a bit of chemistry with. So the first half is this cat and mouse game with a bit of flare. Which I was really into, because the chemistry just seemed to work for the most part. Plus it was intriguing to watch the interactions between the two characters. But once the actual romance starts up with the rich guy just showing the woman a good time, it quickly becomes boring and started to drag in my opinion. Most women dream about turning a bad boy into a man that is just for her, especially if he is a handsome rich guy. And that is what this movie is, although I didn't really see why Crown would fall for the lead women in this movie. But I everyone has their preferences. So you want to watch a film about a topnotch classy Alpha male than this might be a film you might enjoy, for the first half anyways.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gross: $124 million Cost: $48 million (remember when million dollar movies were exceptional)--inflation.Slickly produced expensive "Roger Moore" style heist film. It was not meant to be taken too seriously--some reviewers complain about holes in the plot--this movie is meant to be a lighthearted romantic comedy.Features an upbeat prettified New York of the rich and famous while also appealing to our antisocial natures.The only part that I could have done without were the sex scenes...both Pierce Bronson at 47 and Russo at 45 were a little too long in the tooth for torpid insatiable sex on marble stairs etc....especially Pierce looked a little saggy with out a shirt on. Ditto the true love angle at this age is unbelievable but is part of the formula. Bronson looked like he needed a few hits of amphetamines and viagra a couple times to keep up his manic behavior...The only part I didn't care for was the ending at the museum with a dozen men with bowler hats somehow confusing a large contingent of the NYPD. Too dumb.Still flawlessly filmed well acted but expensive formula star stuff..a 7 ...I am a tough but consistent grader.... 6 is boiler plate (but decent)...say a Jacqueline Suzanne novel...7 a cut above....I like sleepers and surprises. Also try to grade in context....8 is very very good...10 still looking...Russo is definitely the better half of the duo quite funny. But Bronson was OK.Recommend</fullReview>

While Catherine comes to assist the FBI over who stole a rather high valued painting, she suspects that Thomas may have berns the one behind the theft, however instead of apprehending him, she ends up falling in love with him. One of the aspects that I loved about the film was that Thomas was not really a villain but rather treated As a person that fans cared about and rooting for him to to win and end up with Catherine. I think Rene Russo does a marvelous job playing the Catherine part, since part of her wants to catch Thomas but the other half is in love with him.

I loved loved this movie ever since the first time I saw it . To be honest, the story was old ( it's a remake and not as good as the original one) , the acting was so-so, good but not great, even some stiff moments. But still it entertains me every time I watch. The reason why? That's because the soundtracks brilliantly tuned in and even enhanced the storyline, the acting. The movie will always be one great cat-and-mouse chase, very sexy (yes, for 2 middle aged actors, not a popular choice at all, eh? ), sophisticated, modern and high-end movie. And it was also the beginning of my passion in Modern Jazz. Score : ( I love it so don't blame me for being too generous) 4/5 Stars.

		<fullReview>Rene Russo and Pierce Brosnan play the Faye Dunaway and Steve McQueen characters in the original. Whilst this version is obviously more modern, slicker, more colourful and less implausible, it lacks some of the gentle class of the original. Russo plays the insurance investigator as a hard-nosed woman, who will do anything. She seems more of a loose cannon and less together that her 60s counterpart. However, that perhaps makes her more believable, and her investigation has certainly fewer plot holes and more actual procedural parts. Pierce Brosnan is good in this role; but plays Crown rather smarmy and cheesy, rather than cool like Steve McQueen. I'll admit I don't much like him as an actor, particularly, but this has him as role I think he seems to suit. The film production is excellent, it's an attractive, slick looking film and it plays out less like "rich people montages" as the original does but there is an element of that. The characters have some depth both explicit and suggested and I like the excitement from the few twists so there is a little suspense. I've had trouble reviewing both these films so suggest viewers watch both and compare and contrast but both stand alone as entertaining examples of the heist genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's really the Catherine Banning Affair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thomas Crown Affair is like a jigsaw puzzle with the wrong pieces put together in the wrong order. If you stare at it hard, you can almost make out what it was supposed to be. What is actually is, however, looks quite different.A remake of a Steve McQueen film, it begins with a rich, New York City financier named Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan). He's the sort of man who has it all and still isn't fulfilled. He makes bad bets and takes costly risks to bring some meaning and sparkle to his existence. Now, that drive has led him to steal a 100 million dollar Monet painting from a museum. That brings high society insurance investigator Catherine Banning (Rene Russo) into the picture. She instantly fixes on Crown as a suspect, despite a complete lack of evidence, and the two of them begin playing a game a cat and mouse. Banning tries to seduce Crown to get at the painting, but he ends up more than seducing her. She falls in love with the isolated mystery man and has to decide if love is enough or if she also needs to trust him. Along for the ride are Crown's psychiatrist (Faye Dunaway), who appears to exist in the story just to give Faye Dunaway some screen time, and police detective Michael McCann (Denis Leary). McCann is the straight man to the supposedly sophisticated manipulations of Crown and Banning. He's also the most likable character in the movie and when you find yourself rooting more for a minor supporting character than for either of the leads, that's the mark of a film that's gone plain wrong.There are so many things about The Thomas Crown Affair that don't work. To start with the structure is terrible. It opens up with, I kid you not, a 20 minute long museum robbery where Crown is involved for less than a minute. Which means the first 19 minutes of the film are about characters and actions that have absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the movie. Nothing that happens in those first 19 minutes have anything to do with anything else that happens. Then after the theft, Catherine Banning finally comes on screen and within another 10 minutes, she becomes the main character in the story. After initially alluding to Crown's problems and complexities, he quickly becomes second banana to Banning's dilemma of love and trust. Instead of being about what happens to Crown, or even what happens to Crown and Banning, the movie becomes entirely about what happens to Banning. To recap, the film is called The Thomas Crown Affair. It spends 19 of its first 20 minutes focusing on everyone except Thomas Crown. Then after another 10 minutes, it should really be retitled The Catherine Banning Affair.The pacing of the film is also horrid. The big heist at the start is almost 4 times longer than the big event at the end of movie. There's a long montage of Crown and Banning flying a glider followed almost immediately by a another montage of them driving along an island road. A scene where Banning suspects Crown has brought the stolen Monet along with them to the island ends almost before it begins. I'm not sure what director John McTiernan was trying to do with this movie but whatever it was, it didn't work.The soundtrack is also incredibly annoying. Almost every scene is accompanied by this loud, insistent instrumental music that sounds like something from the 1970s that's been digitally remastered. It's almost as though the music is meant to beat you into submission so you don't notice everything else that's wrong.What fatally wounds The Thomas Crown Affair is that both Crown and Banning are unlikable, self-centered jackasses. These two wealthy, arrogant, narcissists are utterly unsympathetic, something only highlighted by the working man appeal of Denis Leary as Detective McCann. Crown and Banning are the sort of puffed up elites that should be deflated by the ordinary McCann. Instead, McCann is just a bystanding stooge watching his betters interact.Rene Russo look really bad for the first part of this movie, as well. Banning has supposedly flown in from Europe to investigate the museum theft, so she's decked out in the Paris-runway type fashions and is adorned with a very pronounced make-up job. I would guess she's supposed to look high class but the clothes make her look stiff and the make up in harsh and garish, making Catherine Banning look frighteningly like a drag queen impersonating Rene Russo. It's only later in the movie when that crap is stripped away that Russo's beauty has a chance to shine.I haven't seen the original Thomas Crown Affair, so I don't know if this is a bad remake of a bad film or a bad remake of a good film. I don't know if it's bad because it stuck to close to the original movie or because it tried to be too different. All I know is, this thing is pretty bad. Unless you're desperately to see Russo topless, don't bother with The Thomas Crown Affair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, not what I was expecting.No, this story was how rich people getting get away with crimes and how society accepts it.It's really about the man - trying to keep us down and how we let it - as long as the people are smiling and well dressed.Yeah, I knew the ending before it came. The sad part is that I knew it would be like that and I continued to watch this.With slick hair, fancy clothes and a smile that can make us do anything, we will fall for anybody who is wealthy and can manipulate us and then just accept it because they can do it.Yes, the rich people win again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you can accept that the only thing of greatness in John McTiernan's remake of The Thomas Crown Affair is the wonderful end title song, Windmills of Your Mind, sung by Sting, I guess this movie will fill two hours of your life nicely.Don't expect a whole lot of tight plotting and three-dimensional characterization. It's a style-heavy heist flick, with Pierce Brosnan pinching his lips together to look intense and Rene Russo trying to appear stylish (but coming off more damaged than anything else) and revealing to the audience that a naked 44 year old woman can look very, very good.But . . .McTiernan's remake is a far cry from the uber-stylish Norman Jewison original. There, you just had to accept Faye Dunaway flipping and flapping about in one designer outfit after another while chasing Steve McQueen. It was an awful movie.Yet, the original stuck with me to this day for two reasons. McQueen, and that chess-playing scene that has to be one of the most exquisitely filmed pieces of movie-making I've ever watched. There's real mystery with Steve McQueen's Thomas Crown. Here's the King of Cool at his height, and you can sense the mystery about him, a hint of something more than stylish slick. Brosnan's version is just more Remington Steele/James Bond cardboard. Dunaway was a designer toothache. Russo tries valiantly to puff some life into her character, but all she accomplishes is portraying her insurance investigator as dissipated and gloomy.Forget the heist part of the movie. There's no sense in it, and you would be foolish to try to find any. TTCA is not meant to be serious--in either of its versions--but my trouble with it is that, if the original is a fluffy pastry, why do we need another less-palatable concoction? Did The Thomas Crown Affair need to be remade?As with almost all remakes, the answer is no.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Elegant World Of 1999 Rich People In NYC Travelogue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thomas Crown Affair (1999) starring Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo is smoother and more elegant than the 1968 movie, the latter shot it proletarian times which valued dirt under the fingernail people (the "proletarian, war on poverty 60's!").McQueen wasn't elegant in the 1968 movie, and places visited in that movie weren't either. The starting scene of the 1968 movie set the tone.....a dumb plastic fantastic no-architecture hotel of the times, sanitary with no style...and fat Jack Weston as the "Everyman" introducing viewers to the story and it's people.Rich people were doing better in 1999, the Thomas Crown Affair version of that year shows it....Brosnan's version of Crown is smoother, more elegant and polished, almost like a dancer.The museum setting of the two heists in the movie (the NYC public library built by elegant people was used for "museum" interiors, the lobby, etc. etc.) makes the movie cultural and celebrates the world of cultured rich people far more than the 1968 movie did.All this is nice....the way "comedy of manners" movies (and stage plays) about rich people in the 1930's and before were nice.....a look at "the good life" served up in elegant settings, and enjoyed by its participants for good reasons.Brosnan's clothes fit better than McQueen's did. His (Brosnan's) hair cut is better, less deliberate, more understated and elegant than McQueen's.The trip to Martineque in the Caribbean was a good touch (contrast it to the GUYS AND DOLLS [1956] trip to Cuba made by Marlon Brando and Jean Simmons), and the improved glider plane in the 1999 movie was, too (much less clunky plane than McQueen's was in 1968).I could almost taste the smooth, high priced wine served in restaurant scenes Brosnan and Russo shared. Expensive red wine priced at $50/bottle in liquor stores, double that in NYC restaurants.The 1999 version of Thomas Crown is a travelogue showing the good life in NYC enjoyed by people with time, money, good taste, and all the rest of it.Except for the heavy sex scenes (which aren't believable or attractive), the movie is easy to watch, enjoyable, and smooth....just like an expensive bottle of good red wine, served in a nice place by good people doing the serving and nearby as fellow customers.Dinner Rush (1990) is another 90's movie about rich people in NYC, and their night life (about gangsters in part, but gangsters with elegant haircuts!).Sometimes, the best part of movies is the travel experience they provide, and the plot and even the acting isn't as important."Where were you?" is sometimes the question to ask.The Thomas Crown Affair (1999) starring Pierce Brosnan does a good job with that.

		<fullReview>Despite being attractive and sexy, oh and extremely well "preserved" Rene Russo totally ruined this movie. Her character is very unbelievable and basically gets f..ked by everybody. Not literally of course, they just mess with her mind, Brosnan f..ks her. She doesn't seen to get anything right the first time. And the sex scenes are fairly poorly done considering there are about 7 seconds of nudity in the whole movie. C'mon, they didn't even show Russo's ass. But Pierce Brosnan shines in his role and just looks like a slick player the whole movie. Great beginning with great music and a bundle of other nice and smart scenes makes "The Thomas Crown Affair" well worth watching. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From trailers I wanted so much to like this movie. Brosnan is good, the plot is good ... much is good ... but I couldn't stomach the parade of slick attitudes by Rene Russo. I felt the whole time she was not IN the movie but just being a too self confident actor doing a lousy job posing her attitudes. Totally phony and unbelievable. Or maybe it's the fault of the director - by definition!Whatever reason it was revolting acting by Russo and such an agony to watch that I never could sink into the movie and its abundance of other qualities.I saw it on TV and by chance it was followed by the movie "Star 80" portraying an even more too self confident and slick personality by Eric Roberts. What a world of a difference in believability and acting/directional power!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Glossy romance film that is only just worth watching if you havenothing else interesting to do. Cliches abound and you can prettymuch figure out the whole plotline within the first half an hour.***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***Rene Russo plays a self-confident 'always one step ahead of thecops' insurance investigator out to catch rich playboy and art thiefPierce Brosnan, and you just know she will end up falling for him,and at some stage of the movie be a blubbering mess with all herconflicting emotions (..."he's a thief and he's bad but he's reallysuch a nice guy and he makes me feel so good! What do I do!!!"... &gt;yawn&lt;....). Chuck in an unneccesary sex scene, a few breastshots, (must have those breast shots, how can a movie be anygood without exposed breasts???) a lot of 'tough independentwoman' talk, amazingly dull cops, and you can pretty much mapout this movie.If you are interested in seeing a clever movie based around artand the whole New York thing, I would suggest something like 'SixDegrees Of Separation'... but if you want something to just eat yourpopcorn to and forget within hours, this is just for you...Moral message of the movie: Rich guys have all the fun and get allthe girls.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Superstation is giving this film the attention it finally deserves, showing it three nights in a row. So if you want to see a really cool, inventive flick that you probably never saw in theaters, plop on to the couch and check it out. Pierce Brosnan plays the title character Crown, who is suspected of stealing a very rare painting. Or did he? The girl hired to investigate Mr. Crown ends up falling for him. Or does she? It's all very complicated and I won't spoil it for any of you. Let us just say that not everything is what it seems in this movie. Also, do not miss the final sequence involving the bowler hat men. It's really very funny and clever at the same time. Denis Leary's role in the film was basically, "Hey, you aren't in love with the guy, are you? This is a case! Don't get emotionally involved!" This kind of line was spoken many times when Denis was in the room with Rene Russo, who plays the detective. These scenes are kind of repetitive, so in the end Denis' character didn't add up to much for me. Other than that, though, TTCA is definitely one for Brosnan fans who want to see him in something other than a James Bond sequel, those who like involving plots with some mystery and intrigue, or the people who don't want to see another crappy hour and a half of action, explosions, and screaming. This is a thinking man's movie, to be sure. You've been warned Men In Black II fans. Turn on the brain before deciding to watch this! 4 out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hmmm, where do I start. Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo did a fantastic acting job in this movie. Brosnan's Thomas Crown character is both innovative and cunning, and Russo's character, Catherine Banning, turns out to be his match in both departments. Even though Banning is assigned to discover whether or not Crown truly stole the painting from the museum, Banning gets rather `caught up in her work', so to speak; she and Crown end up in a complex love affair.The scenes between Brosnan and Russo are *very* classy, and the climax was very nicely done (that's all I can say without spoiling it). The music is also *very* well composed, and is not something to be overlooked. If you like a good movie, check this out, you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

This film stands in its own right, and needs no connection with the 1968 version.I enjoyed every second of this film, it's beautifully set cinematography and sharp script.Of course, Brosnan plays the perfect playboy, and Russo is stunningly seductive. The plot is intruiging and has a fair bit of depth. As you watch the film, you realise that the story is always one step ahead of you. Happy ending or not, this is not your average predictable Hollywood product.It's a film that unfortunately won't become a classic, partly down to the fact that it's a remake.

		<fullReview>I was not alive in the 60's and had never heard of the original Thomas Crown Affair until the new one came out. I have never seen any Steve Mcqueen movie, so I can't compare him to Pierce Brosnan. What I can say is this is a very sexy and fun movie.Crown is the type of rich, suave character Brosnan was born to play. If you liked him as Remington Steele or James Bond, you will enjoy this character. Rene Russo has been lucky enough to not only get great roles, but to work with some of the top actors in Hollywood. Russo and Brosnan are great together. These 40-something actors burn up the screen in their sex scenes. Russo is totally sexy here, especially when she shakes her behind while wearing a see-through dress. Denis Leary is terrific in a small part as a cop. I wish he'd had a bigger role.The Thomas Crown Affair is a fun movie. At a time when so many teenage movies are being made, it's refreshing to see two sexy older stars who get to frolic and have fun on-screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SMART MOVIE PLAYS DUMB TOO MUCH</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of the original "Thomas Crown Affair," even though it stars Steve McQueen one of the least appreciated actors these days. The opening bank job, done multi-screen style, is well done. And the seduction scene played out with chess pieces shows that very suggestive eroticism can be done with class and wit. But overall, its a very forgettable film (and you can keep the "Windmills of Your Mind"). So, this is not a film that the idea of a remake triggers that urge to go maim studio execs. Considering how dated the original is, updating it made a lot of sense. The casting of the underused Rene Russo with Pierce Brosnan was a good choice. I point all this out so I don't have to pull out my mea culpa when I say it didn't exactly bowl me over (or bowler, if you've seen it already). Mostly, this is a film that wants to be thought of as smart and sophisticated. Overall, the filmmakers succeed in giving us film that is that occasionally. I think what I didn't like about the film is that it never trusts the audience. Any time a point is made, it has to be underscored so that there is no doubt we got it. Early on, Crown (Brosnan) is shown entering a building with a prominently framed sign for Crown Acquisitions. When a Suit in the lobby hurries a new security guard away who doesn't realize who Crown is, not only do the producers have to throw in the guard saying off screen "What, he own the building or something?" but they have to insult the audience even more my adding "Yes, he does." Following a scant few minutes later is a scene meant to show Crown as a top dog financial whiz, but again the filmmakers can't help themselves by pounding the nail on the head to make sure the dumbest members of the audience get that he just bested the other players in the deal. "Affair" hits it's roughest waters once it becomes a cat and mouse game between the trying-to-retain-his-cool Brosnan and trying-not-get-too-hot Russo waiting for the other to make both professional and emotional mistakes. When the central mystery becomes "will she figure out how to nail him for doing it?" versus a standard whodunit an audience expects a lot of intelligence from the filmmakers. Imagine pitching an idea for a weekly TV show about a detective who solves crimes that the audience already knows the culprit of and the brilliance of "Columbo" is much more impressive. Also, instead of a selfish rich man who wants to keep masterpieces all to himself the audience is given the very likable cad Thomas Crown. You want him to succeed. Sort of. Yet, in this period of cat and mouse, "Crown" manages to give us something rare and probably more in demand than studios realize: an adult, mature, frank sexual relationship. Both the producers (of which Brosnan was one) and Ms. Russo should be applauded for once not having the forty-something male actor cavorting around with a twenty-something flavor-of-the-month actress. Reportedly using no body doubles, Ms Russo frolics au naturel giving us more than a glimpse of her forty plus form. Then comes the ending, featuring another elaborate heist. And "Affair's" dalliance with smarts turns around and bites it in the ass. A film can't tell an audience to keep it's brain in "Drive" and then expect them to shift to neutral when it decides to play it dumb. After showing a well thought-out and very plausible purloin-the-masterpiece sequence in the beginning, plausibility goes out the window for the closing art snatching scene. Again and again the audience is asked to buy one preposterous turn after another. Then comes a big blunder by the director, John McTiernan, in order to keep brain-challenged with the rest of the crowd. To describe it would be to reveal too much. Just ask yourself should you see it, did you really have to watch each step of the way as the painting is revealed or wouldn't a slow pan up have worked much better? The way he chooses to shoot it is par for the course of the rest of this not-quite-as-smart-as-they-thought film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thomas Crown, a rich man who has everything, has just pulled off one of the most spectacular crimes. He stole a painting worth some million dollars, I can't remember the amout, but it was valuable. He falls in love with the woman sent to recover the painting. No one suspects Crown of anything, except her. That's all I'll tell you, because you'll have to find out for yourself what happens.I loved this movie the first time I saw it. It had the humor and the the wit that I like in movies. Pierce Brosan was perfect for the role of Thomas Crown. He is one of the only people who could have pulled this off so well. Since he's basically used to the role after his work as Bond.The ending is quite hiliarious, and touching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, weak ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie, maybe I'm biased for Brosnan, but I thought it interesting. Plus the fact a fortysomething Rene Russo bothered to do a rather sexual scene (which is a rarety since a lot of movies go for that, oh so young look). It had a depth of reality to it. However comparing this movie with Entrapment, I'm likely to like Entrapment more. Simply because Catherine Zeta Jones worked so well with Sean Connery, than Rene Russo to Pierce Brosnan.I also didn't think the ending to TTCA was strong enough. (spoiler below)sure maybe we all wanna finish going out on a plane in a movie, but there was something about it that didn't hit me as a movie should.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Serious Mishmash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't know whether the intention of the story was to highlight Rene Russo's breasts or to make you like an obvious criminal. The movie was totally disjointed and difficult to follow. You have an intricate plan to rob an art museum at the beginning that was nothing but a ruse so Bronson could heist a painting that we are never sure whether he wanted in the first place. He seems to like to live life on the edge and is more concerned with the challenge of doing something (betting $100,000 on a virtually impossible golf shot) than the actual result.At the start Russo is shown as a sexy super sleuth that seems to have everything figured out from the minimum of clues. I was totally in the dark as to what she actually was (an insurance investigator perhaps?). I found her annoying more than sexy throughout the movie. Overall I was very disappointed with this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick remake a good film in it's own right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to compare the remake with the original because this film stands on its own. As a matter of fact, the story is probably the weakest element of this film and it was pretty good.This was a slick, big money production that delivered. John McTiernan's direction was excellent, the photography rich, the locations magnificent and the opulent lifestyle nicely portrayed.In the story, a rich gazillionaire art collector, bored with the ease with which he makes his gazillions, decides to steal a Monet that he easily could have purchased if it were for sale. Hmmmmm. A little far fetched, but okay. The heist itself was the best part of the plot. The rest of the story after his nemesis love interest (Rene Russo) is introduced is pretty predictable stuff. The writers tried to throw in a couple of curves but I can't imagine anyone was fooled. Still, it was entertaining and there is a certain feeling of harmony when everything turns out about the way the viewer hopes and expects.Pierce Brosnan was the perfect choice for this role. It was a small transition from James Bond to Double O Seven Figures. He only had to lose the Walther PPK. He was born to play the oversexed, smarter than everyone else, high society loner. With him as the anchor, the film could not go too far wrong.I have mixed feelings about the selection of sex symbol wanna-be Rene Russo, who was looking a bit weather beaten in this film. Russo's (and McTiernan's) decision to bare all was a miscalculation. Rene's sexuality benefits when something is left to the imagination. On the other hand, she handled the emotional tight rope of the character superbly; cunning, smart, and torn between her ambition and her passion. If you could combine Russo's acting ability with Catherine Zeta-Jones' (who played essentially the same character in "Entrapment") looks you'd have the perfect actress for this role.Denis Leary, as the detective, was the biggest disappointment. Here is a guy who has perfected the art of being the insensitive tough guy, trying to play the role as Mr. Sensitive. He was either miscast or misguided in this endeavor. It fell flat as a canvas.All in all, a commendable film. I gave it an 8, and though it may not become a classic, you could do a lot worse. </fullReview>

There is one thing, however, that makes this movie completely annoying. That is Rene Russo. Her acting performance is horrendous. When her acting wasn't so horrible, I still couldn't ignore the fact that she is completely repulsive. This movie could have been spectacular had someone else been cast in her stead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am sure I'm in the minority (I know I am among my friends), but I found this movie long, boring and gratuitous. The fact that the role played by DENIS LEARY is the most likable character (the only other time I liked him at all was in "A Bug's Life"!) speaks volumes. Rene Russo's character was irritating beyond belief and Thomas Crowne himself was flat and stereotypical. To say he was two-dimensional may be a little generous. (No, the scenes with his psychiatrist did NOT help make him real.)With the exception of two wonderful scenes (both involving the museum caper and NOT involving Rene Russo), this movie made me wish I were at home watching televised golf.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Thomas Crown Affair" is a terrible remake of a not-very-good movie, redeemable only for the topless shots of former supermodel Renee Russo.That's it. The plot is negligible, Pierce Brosnan phoned in his part, and Dennis Leary (as usual) plays an annoying Irish cop, but I couldn't take my eyes off the beautiful Ms. Russo. There's an okay love-making scene on a stairway, a terrifically sexy ballroom dance, a topless beach scene, and a roll in the sack. Oh, and there's a painting stolen from a museum and a catamaran gets sunk.But let's hope other directors recognize Ms. Russo's perky attributes and cast her in more, highly-visible roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bond Gone Bad is far from Crown Gone Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must be one of the biggest fans of the Norman Jewison film The Thomas Crown Affair from 1968. With its suave stars (Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway) and its terrific look (thanks to Jewison's direction and the cinematography of the great Haskell Wexler) the original The Thomas Crown Affair is a salute to experimental filmmaking in the 1960s. Now 31 years later I am forced through a remake that would have been better titled James Bond Gone Bad than The Thomas Crown Affair. Very little of the original still remains in this supposed remake. The only things that cause a similarity between the two: the main character is a wealthy trader named Thomas Crown, a robbery causes the interest of an insurance investigator that falls for Mr. Crown, and a fly in a plane over fields. The differences are much bigger and more important like the fact that the bank robbery in the original is now the stealing of a painting. Even the two main supporting (oxymoron?) have different character names. Then of course there is the fact that the two have completely different and opposing endings (I remember a story where some writer changed the final line of a poem and in turn the poem completely opposed the statement it had made before the change; that is pretty much how this change works).This version of The Thomas Crown Affair follows the relationship that blossoms between a white-collar thief (Brosnan) and the insurance officer investigating him (Russo). Along the way, she must meet the problems caused by police officer Michael McCann (Leary) who would rather be busting some thugs than after some painting. As stated before, the robbery involves a priceless painting that Crown steals for his own pleasure and for the thrill of the chase.The opening and closing parts of the film are enjoyable (though the ending is pretty bad), but the rest of the film is near awful. Brosnan and Russo are sub par (and by the way, I do not think that all that Rene Russo nudity was needed; Reese Witherspoon in Twilight: understandable, Rene Russo in The Thomas Crown Affair: no!). McTiernan had proven once again that he cannot direct and making me even more fearful about The 13th Warrior. None of the comic relief really works and neither of the stars show any real charisma (especially Russo). Still there were small moments that I liked in the film, as well as some nice quirky moments, but the film on a whole is a straight out disappointment. Do yourself a favor and rent the original instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this at a preview last night -- wonderful. Rene Russo is incredibly beautiful and plays her role with the right mix of beauty &amp; brains. She's smart, seductive, daring and gorgeous. It took a lot of confidence to do her first nude scene at age 45, and she pulls it off with panache. Pierce Brosnan is equally sexy as a billionaire who steals a Monet for sport from the Met (which also is beautiful). The plot twists are wonderful, better than the original. The New York upper crust life that Thomas Crown (Brosnan) leads is nicely contrasted with the poor slob cops chasing him. The homages to the original are less than subtle, but are in good taste. While the story is not credible, you willingly suspend disbelief to see how this beautiful-people love story turns out, and it does not disappoint. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Tomas Crown affair Directed by John McTiernanI've never had real class and style, but Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) has it all. When Thomas Crown is bored, he likes to visit the Guggenheim museum in Manhattan. There is one of the greatest paintings ever, "the Crepuscule" from Claude Monet on exhibition. On just an ordinary day the painting is stolen. Catherine Banning (Rene Russo) a bounty hunter, who is sent in by a Swiss insurance company, wants to solve the theft. She suspects Thomas Crown from the start. What follows is a cat-and-mouse-game between Catherine and Thomas.Thomas Crown is the reason that I like this movie so much. His extravagant style and class makes me want to be him. For example, Thomas has got a nice car with a driver, a nice house in the middle of New York with his own butler, a very nice yet plane etc. These are not the things which give him style, it's the way he treats his property and servants. He is really easy going and gentle to them. He treats people with respect,that's why people treat him with respect too.Thomas Crown has got his own company: Crown Acquisitions. He is a very wealthy man who likes to enjoy his money. As already told before, Thomas is easily bored. When he is bored he makes up the most exiting things to do. For example he destroyed a 100.000 dollar boat just because he liked the splash. He also likes to play other exiting games, like the game he plays with Catherine. But the question is, can he win this one. The larger theme of the movie is action/romance. This is because of the great wonderful scenes like the scene with were Catherine and Thomas were flying in a glider. They made a wonderful tour through the hills. They landed about four states away from Thomas his car. He called someone to pick them up and they were brought to an airport from were they flew to a very beautiful tropical island. Thomas has a really nice house on the island on the top of a mountain. The view was wonderful they could see a part of a jungle and the sea. Even though the movie is filled with nice romantic scenes, the movie doesn't become soft at all. The movie never gets dull because the cat and mouse game between Thomas and Catherine goes on.This movie from John McTiernan is his best movie ever. If you will take a look at it, you will see a wonderful playful movie about a rich man and his nicely played games. You also will find out if Thomas will ever grow up and if he will end his games.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shows that McT CAN do a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Sting's rendition of "Windmills of Your Mind" compared to Noel Harrison's, this is SO much better than the original, which was all surface and style and flash, with the gloss and depth of floor polish (1 coat). Brosnan and Russo aren't as all-out glamorous as McQ and Faye, but much more apt to their roles and they do strike sparks with each other. The difficulties of these two closed-off people finding each other in the midst of a major theft investigation are clearly shown. The movie does exactly what great remakes should and damned few do because the phrase "great remake" is an oxymoron. It plays off the original, updates it and makes it fit into a different world, entertains equally those who've seen the original (by confounding their expectations at every turn) and those who haven't. The various facets of the plot fit more tightly together and all obey Poe's dictum about short stories--every word bends toward the finale. As an example: the gratuitous "other woman" in the original, seemingly there only for a cool gliding sequence and to make Faye's character jealous, becomes an integral part of the story. Russo's Katherine Banning is given more opportunities to be smart and perceptive than Dunaway's, while Brosnan's Crown is softer and more sympathetic. He actually has a character arc, which is more than can be said for McQ's one-note samba. Dennis Leary's cop is also given a character and an arc, instead of being merely a sounding board and moral finger-pointer like Paul Burke. The music is great, especially the use of "Sinner Man" which began turning up everywhere after this came out. And one more subtle concordance I didn't notice till the DVD came out: the autumn leaves really are turning to the color of Rene Russo's hair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Typical Hollywood Movie Of The 2000s !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The year 1999 nearly defined by its production the kinds of movies which Hollywood will make commercially during the next decade. Regard this well : First the original ones :*(American Pie - 1999) : The teen.. High school.. Gross out comedy with all the outrages sex jokes, all the types of human liquids, toilet humor. It's actually the extreme bad tasting at its most lovable extent or golden age ! *(The Matrix - 1999) : The entertaining movie as a Sci-Fi action saga with a lot of mythical elements, and a lot of C.G.I. It's Terminator meets Star Wars in some trilogy (or trilogies !). *(American Beauty - 1999) : The opposite of the commercials flicks, the nice pastime movies, ..etc. It's the serious movie at its best; there is one case, one pure treatment, one fine message, And no sequels !Then the unoriginal : *(X-Men - 2000) : Yes, It's in 2000 but it was the strong prelude of the comics superheroes' mania at the whole 2000s, so the video games, graphic novels, ..etc. *(The Thomas Crown Affair - 1999) : The remake (of a movie, a TV show, ..etc). Here it's a remake of another American movie whereas there are a lot of other remakes of non-American movies also ! According to this just measure any contemporary American movie from the majors studios at the 2000s and I bet you it'll never be out of this list, this map, or this guide.. Whatever you call it. Truly as a modern remake this version of (Thomas Crown Affair) said it all, especially the new main formula of Hollywood for making such a profitable bargain : the catchy title (to assure the cinematic distribution all over the world by the guaranteed very known story) + the attractive stars (who can blame them if they couldn't act !) + A hot love scene (in the nude sex scene to be specific.. Hey it's the 2000s !) + Some thrill..Action.. crime (the same of what we love about Hollywood.. you know !) = mostly a lousy remake ! That had quite nothing of its original source which would be higher compared to this. Of course there are some exceptions like "Ocean's Eleven" for instance but unfortunately the basic rule here is that this waterfall of remakes which we've getting from Hollywood during the last decade made us so thirsty to the original works despite the remake's good quality or shiny surface. It generally confirms just one thing : the bankrupt of the new good ideas in Hollywood where the story is dead or about to be ! This movie is so bad whether we compared it to the stylish, not genius first one, or not ! Actually the whole defects of the original are here and more. For example, still (Thomas Crown) is the man of non-understandable motives yet with a happy ending too !! Maybe you'll understand it well if only you're a producer and in Hollywood whereas the audience must leave their seats satisfied whatever what, even if the twist is so dull and impossible but who wants us to think ?! And don't forget, it has a real precious opportunity for a sequel too (which is going to be made-as I knew it lately-in 2008 !). So what did we as the poor viewers gain anyway : some good music, some forgettable conflict (had been grounded so weakly), some hot sexy scenes but since the frigid (Pierce Brosnan) and Frankenstein face (Rene Russo) are not my cup of tea or even my cup I didn't care much ! and speaking of which, (Russo) looked here mannish enough so how by any chance to believe her in the role of that Femme Fatale investigator !?? And it's eventually some tasteless pastime movie which had no spirit exactly like its character (and its star !). All in all it's Hollywood bright crap again and again but not that original, amusing nor even well made as we used to have for most of the time. But what can we say ? It's the 2000s !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some would argue that this film falls short of being a masterpiece.But then again, with the plot that they had to work with, I fail to see how any director or group of film makers could make this sort of film into an Oscar showering epic.So let's be realistic here. This is supposed to be a light hearted and entertaining film and I believe they nailed it. The casting was the first amazing achievement. To begin with, they accomplished something that had never been accomplished before: A James Bond playing the lead role in a non-bond film while under contract. Pierce Brosnan is, in my opinion, a highly underrated actor and I couldn't imagine anyone doing a better job in the role of Thomas Crown.Rene Russo was terrific. While this was her first nude scene in a film, it also now appears to be the last major film she had a part in. Since this, her career appears to have slowed, but that could easily be by choice rather than the decision of casting departments.While there were reasonable support roles, all other parts were relatively ancillary to the two main roles.The plot was nice and cute, without being overdone - which is rare for an American film. The script was sharp without being far fetched or absurd and best of all, the 'cat-and-mouse' aspect of the film was intriguing and entertaining. The bowler hat sequence at the end of the film was magnificent as was the final 10 minutes of the film.Overall, very entertaining, clean and highly recommended without being overcooked on any front. Good watch and enjoy it for what it is, not what you expect/hope it to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A supposed matching of wits between wealthy cosmopolitans set in visually rewarding locations. As a remake, it succeeds in adding enough zeros to all mentions of money in adjusting for inflation, updating the 'groovy' 60's look, and generally adding enough detail to the plot in such a way that the original reads like it was made for TV. The gratuitously embellished plot though, leaves a few questions regarding the intelligence of the characters. One example is when Banning realizes that the suitcase was put under the bench to aid the real thief. If she really were so observant and resourceful, why doesn't she just rewind the security video to see who placed the suitcase there to begin with? Nice touch including Faye Dunaway in the remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thomas Crown Affair is a great heist movie. It is clever and original (of course not that original... it is a remake).Pierce Brosnan does a great job as the main character and his acting talents lend themselves to a suave, live dangerously rich guy (I mean, he is James Bond as well).Now the problem. Rene Russo. Her character is not only a huge clich, but she does a horrible job acting out the part, and is relatively unattractive on top of all that. Who wants some apparently over the hill bad actress in a bad role. She wears thigh high black leather boots to work, you know, 'cause she is sexy, but then sits down and drinks sludge in one big gulp. Oh I get it, she is tough too.If only the stupidity of one character did not consistently ruin scenes and annoy the viewer this movie would be a solid 7 or 8. Putting Rene in makes it a 5. And I'm being generous.</fullReview>

But I "bleeped" that so as to let the rest of the movie flow, here were two worthy adversaries - Renee as Catherine Banning and Pierce the Producer and Thomas Crown.His Crown character brought to mind the apocryphal story that Alexander The Great wept when there were no more worlds to conquer, ennui is a terrible thing and creates trouble when there is none ... simply to see if it can be overcome! I love the diversion of a botched robbery, how the air-conditioning was disabled to botch the new cameras then the real painting was there all along?? As a Cezanne or Pizarro, LOL!! By Crown himself, laughing at everyone, in a quiet version of the anonymous businessman that he so loved.Even if he didn't have a glide or a private jet to Martinique, he still would've seduced the sequins off of that dress Russo wore, the film was dynamite carefully timed and dovetailed to create an effect like a beautiful domino display that only is realised when the pegs fall into place.Denis Leary as the wanna-be lover of Banning was all too true in life, meet a chick and she seems like the bee's knees, but she has the hots for someone else! Faye Dunaway back in the remake (after a sultry performance in the original as the 1st Catherine Banning), this time as the snide and sarcastic shrink who was just the tonic needed to save Crown/Brosnan from himself - Peter Pan growing up and carrying away Wendy...As for the very end, when Renee Russo thought she lost him for good - sigh - keep them Kleenex handy!

I like movies that do that.The art, toys and clothing, cars, boats and planes were an added pleasure to this movie.I would have to say that Rene Russo's black dress is what brought Hollywood women back into couture. I think that she did more for the clothing industry than any other person in the past 10 years. You go, girl. Kudos to you for wearing that dress to the Academy Awards Ceremonies!

		<shortDescription>Slick, Glossy Caper Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film stars the perfectly cast, suave Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo as counterparts to each other in this high class, glossy, slick art theft film. It's also a remake of the 1968 film starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway, who appears here as Brosnan's therapist in cameo scenes. There are a number of supporting actors, such as Ben Gazzara, but this is essentially a two person film. The film opens with a fantastic heist scenario and ends with an even cleverer heist. In between, the film alternates between a battle of wits and a romance. The battle of wits is interesting, but the romance is not always entirely believable. The jazzy soundtrack and location shooting add a lot to the enjoyment of the film. There's comedy, romance, and thrills to be had. However, the film would have been even better with a strong third lead as a police investigator that tracks both of them. More surprises, twists, and turns would have been available for the writer to explore. Perhaps that would provide too much intellectual busyness. In most of these art caper films it's the relationship between the characters that gives the films their specialness: To Catch A Thief and How To Steal A Million among them. An enjoyable film, especially good as a date film perhaps, but a better caper film came out in 1999: Entrapment. *** of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That rare thing.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is that rare thing - a remake which is actually better than the original. But then again, let's take stock - the original is all cool moves and 60s split-screen and McQueen being iconic. Fondly remembered but actually not that good.IT hasn't aged well, and the erotic stuff now looks less than that. The remake, however, is less fond of trickery,and the clear chemistry between Brosnan and Russo - and how refreshing is that,to see two main characters of the same age, behaving like adults - makes the screen light up. The plot also has the decency to make the characters act in such a way that the plot is never a foregone conclusion, so that you're always engrossed, and never less than entertained. Ideal weekend movie fare, and a film which bears up to being watched, simply for the pleasure of being entertained, many times over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this. Its a good film to watch with a few friends round on an evening. Easy to watch due to a simple plot. Brosnan and Russo are great together and were one of the best matches on screen I have seen for a while. The one thing that sets the film off is the music which is excellent and really adds to the feel of the film. Its better than a lot of stuff Hollywood pump out. Brosnan produced it.

This is a movie that had messages on many levels, and was an absolute joy to watch. We are in the know as to who did it, but what we didn't expect was to discover why.We suspect it is because someone has too much money and time on their hands. Perhaps, but do look deeper, you'll be glad you did. I cannot say enough about Rene Russo, although it is my opinion that a better leading man could have escalated this movie higher. Denis Leary gives one of his best performances as a lead detective working with Russo's character, and Frankie Faison is not to be overlooked either in this movie. The cameo nod to Faye Dunaway should help bridge the time gap between this movie and it's predecessor, and further update it's setting to present times. A classic, perfect for an impromptu date night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nothing Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring Pierce Brosnan as a wealthy banker who steals fine art because of the thrill of it and Renee Russo as an insurance investigator, this film is supposed to be witty, sophisticated and interesting.There are some cleverly conceived capers which are so unreal as to be comical, a clash of egos between the two lead characters who never rise above their pretentious characterizations, and some supposed sex scenes which show off the photographer's use of creative camera angles but lack any bit of real eroticism. The characters play mind games with each other and that's supposed to be sexy. The degree of luxury is unreal, and although Russo wears a different outfit in every scene, she never seems really attractive. Neither does Brosnan. Basically, they seem like dressed up dolls playing a silly game.Faye Dunaway, who was in the original 1968 version with Steve McQueen, has a small and silly part as Brosnan's psychiatrist. Ben Gazzara also has a tiny part as Brosnan's lawyer.At no time did I identify with or have any feeling for any of the cardboard characters. And there wasn't enough action to call this an action movie. I never got into the story and was bored throughout.Not recommended.</fullReview>

There was an entire hour in the middle of it that could have been scrapped without losing any essential element of plot. It also suffered a major identity crisis, not knowing whether it should be a thriller, a crime caper, a romance or a character study. It turns out that it was not any of these with any degree of conviction. A real letdown!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a remake, this movie is as poor as can be. This is actually a translation of a beautiful movie in to a language of stupid American half-wits who can't read beauty. Let' make everything corny for illiterate yanks. We have all witnessed the downfall of American mainstream cinematography, but for me personally this is too much. Close to the remake of The Stepford Wives. Someone actually tried to fit slimy, spineless Pierce Brosnan into the shoes of all time god Steve McQueen, and drawer jaw Rene Russo into a thong (I wish I've never seen this), dancing to some cheap Latin rhythm, perking her drawer as though in trance. Instead of Faye Dunaway softly meddling chessboard figures, and moistening her lips until she drives Thomas Crown out of his minds. I don't want to be reasonable about this movie, this is a shame.Has general taste really descended this low? Does this movie really stand where the original use to? Instead of an absolute genius Michel Legrand playing one of his greatest chanson sung by Noel Harrison, you've been offered some Latin wiggling, absurd flipping of a trimaran yacht, with one goal only and that is to try (desperately) to make Pierce look cool about it, and in the end Rene's drawer jaw face to convince you that she is an intelligent detective. Pierce Brosnan does not look, for one moment, as though he is bored by his wealth and wants to raise the odds by going against the law; he looks like a show-off with extreme lacking of that Chekhovian stroke of superfluity and wastefulness that McQueen wore so naturally, and what is Thomas Crown all about in the end. Why do they do this to movies, why can't they leave it the hell alone? This is poor. My only regret is the score by Nina Simone</fullReview>

The dialogue and general script are well written, the acting is great, the cast is really well put together.I saw this movie in theaters on a date and we both liked it, and now my fiance (a different man) likes it too, but says it's a date movie (though he watches it alone and thinks I don't know :).Women will definitely like it and guys probably will too.

It is a fast paced movie with a lot of dry humor and sexual appeal (The sex scene is very explicit). You have to watch all of the details in order to follow the movie and it really makes you think! I think that Rene Russo and Pierce Brosnan have an excellent chemistry together and Denis Leary makes a great cop who though starts out bitter, softens up quite a bit to someone you end up liking. The music is excellent especially Nina Simone's "Sinner Man" and the song from the original movie "Windmills of your Mind" The scenery is beautiful the effects are great and it is a movie that you will want to watch over and over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not see the original, so I can't compare, but I found The Thomas Crown Affair to be slick, formulaic and, overall, rather entertaining. 5 stars out of 10.I won't complain about the numerous plot holes where the viewer is required to suspend disbelief (other reviewers have pointed them out, in detail). Suffice it to say that there are many scenes where you go "but that would never happen!" Still, most of the ridiculous events in this film can actually be explained away if you try hard enough.Therefore, if you can manage to suspend disbelief and go along for the ride, it's a decent yarn ? it held my attention from start to finish.Yes, it's way too slick, and way too Hollywood. The background music is awful (at times), the product placements are shameless, the characters are a bit cartoonish. But it's also decent entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't hold up (if indeed it ever did...)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes, your first impression is right: when I saw this film in high school, I remembered thinking, "All form and no substance." Re-watching it last evening not only reconfirmed that, but the passage of time makes its weaknesses even more obvious: when you put aside the great photography and sets (and they are great) and the star power of Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway, there's not much else here. We see how wealthy Thomas Crown is (glider flying, polo game, well-appointed house) and how sophisticated Vicki Anderson is (mostly the wardrobe). But without that form and style, the content that is left is vacuous. Where's the sparring and test of wills? She tells him right away he's the target and he has to prove he doesn't blanch easily. The scene with him and Jack Weston at the police station is a good one because it shows what Thomas Crown is made of: nerves of steel. The film could have used more scenes like that. In real life, of course, none of this could happen anyway (an insurance investigator who went to bed with the target would be out of a job by nightfall). But even allowing for the poetic license of movies, what drives these characters doesn't make much sense: 1. Let's say she DOES fall in love him (and that's a big if ? she's presented as a cut-throat investigator who only wants the 10% she'll get for solving the crime). Still, she's never presented with any options ? like throwing the investigation over and running off with him. Instead, the "crisis" at the end is having her stand by and watch him replicate the heist. Her actions simply serve the plot instead of driving it. 2. Or, let's say he falls in love with HER. If he really loves her, why doesn't he try to tempt her to go off with him? Instead, they spend their time as though they are in a relationship where one person is terminally ill and they know there's only a little time left. 3. At the end, there's a twist ? but since there's not much at stake for either of them (she's not going to run off with him and he hasn't asked her to do so anyway), the twist doesn't hurt. We're not left feeling sad that these characters crossed in the night, but missed. Instead, we watch passively as she is left holding the bag (figuratively) ? and after all, did she really think he would show up and allow himself to be arrested? The split screen photography is terrific and it works. It's not there just to dazzle us: it actually serves the plot. But how well this component works only goes to show how empty the rest of the film is.The remake (1999) is much better: the investigator (Renee Russo) isn't a clotheshorse looking for love. She's tough and driven ? she wants to beat him. The sparing between the two sets off sparks. Granted some of improvement of the 1999 version may be the evolution of the relationship between men and women since 1968. But still, it does give you a feel for some of the lost opportunities of the first version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fist time, it impresses you as a quality thriller. Second time, it impresses you as a quality romantic thriller. Third time, it looks much deeper into the human mind.This movie is not made for general audience. If you advise your kids not to play with fire because they may burn their pretty hands, make sure they don't watch this film. If they don't spoil, they will flood IMDb bragging about how it hurt their sense of morality. For a very few, who live in a league isolated and unmistakable with a common man's, morality takes after a different sort of definition. When you are in their game, and you sense adrenaline flowing through your veins like you never expected it to, the definition of morality becomes abrasive.Thomas Crown is a billion dollar man with many million dollar plans that often fail to rescue him from the quotidian ennui. Katherine Benning is not so much of a an elite herself but more like a hunter of elite criminals who do it just to see if they can get away with it. They see each other, play the cat and mouse game, and don't realize when the game became their life.Wonderful movie. I give it a 7 because at the first glance, it's light in nature. For sure second thoughts, it could deserve an 8. If you don't like the deep stuff, no matter; you will not be bored for a single moment.If you think Brosnan was born to play Bond, then this is his best Bond film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As this movie started I had built-in resistance to the movies premise as little more than the costly diversions of the bored, idle rich. And the movie is certainly guilty of countless crimes against audiences by the time it becomes a much, much better film. Every fifteen minutes or so, a truly interesting, intelligent development occurs. And startling payoffs, that have nothing to do with explosions or screen-writing cop-outs, begin arriving in the 2nd half: The smirk of recognition from the forger. The double meaning of the hotty that Thomas is hanging around with. The "returning the painting" sequence made my mouth hang open completely. How may times does a concluding sequence leave you joyous, smiling, and your hair standing on end?But I still had reservations about the movie. I still resented that Russo had to, as women generally do, cave in the end.How satisfying then to discover on the 2nd viewing that all of Thomas's rejoinders are smartly phrased to provide ambiguous double-meanings, which I missed the first time. The first viewing suggests he is master of all he commands. But upon the 2nd viewing, a new layer of meaning emerges. In every interaction with Russo he tests her to see if she's on board, via the neutral voice. Rather than establishing his superiority, he is trying to yield to her but can't play his hand, and is forced to use neutral language to feel her out. Seen this way, he yields long before she does. What an intelligent film.Small problems: I hate the insipid dance scene. The sex is gratuitous for a movie this intelligent, and it's a crying shame about all those conspicuous Pepsi One, Lucent product placements. Save those for shitty movies please. Russo's irritating witch-cackle is also hard to forgive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always enjoyed this remake. I went back and watched the original with Steve you know who. I would write out his name but when I do, I M D B treats it as a prohibited word. The script was written by a woman, Leslie Dixon. This is clear in the dialog she gave to the character portrayed by Faye Done Away. I know that's not how her name is spelled but then I M D B thinks her last name is a prohibited word. Idiots. Anyway, in the movie, the shrink accuses Thomas Crown of being a Peter Pan. How convenient to forget Jesus saying "You must become like little children". So when men do, women rag on them for being little boys. Also implied in the dialog of the shrink is a reluctance to commit, a common complaint of women about men, completely ignoring the fact that the man HAS committed. And that commitment is this: HE AIN'T MARRYING YOU, PIG. Get that through your thick skull.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tense romantic thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading the summary of the film I was lead to believe this 1999 hit maybe questionable but thankfully after a while I was proved wrong.Pierce Brosnan (Goldeneye, Tomorrow Never dies) stars as Thomas Crown who is a rich painting loving snob who steals and deals paintings for a living. British agent Rene Russo (Get Shorty) is brought in to investigate the mysterious millionaire. Up until the point where Rene was introduced I was lead to believe that this film would be overly predictable and outright boring. The first half an hour or so is extremely dull. Brosnan's character is poor with no personality (not much of a change but still...) and the story is terribly poor.If you want a terrible action scene watch when his agents are underground turning off the alarm systems with atrocious music juxtaposed with bad filming was making me cry for help. It was very conventional and uninteresting and made me want to turn off but I kept at it and thankfully I did because the film remembered it had a purpose, to engage the audience through uses and gratification: Rene Russo.A fantastic performance as she performed brilliantly and steal the show from Brosnan. Her actions are outstanding as she learns throughout the film about her feelings in different frustrating situations as she tries to cope with her job and personal issues. Her likable flirtatious character is always under pressure and is extremely enjoyable.Brosnan to his credit performs acceptably. But he always chooses a character with a boring personality e.g. James Bond, Stu from Mrs Doubtfire and its hard to accept him as a good actor if he continues these types of performances.Apart from the beginning the plot is exciting and tense with many twists and turns at the end.This remake of the infamous 1968 film brings charm and excitement to the romantic thriller genre with an exciting plot but with inconsistent acting there is always a question of verisimilitude.If you enjoy tension and an amazing love relationship then I defiantly recommend this film</fullReview>

With excellent writing, acting and cinematography on all accounts it is impossible to find a hole in the plot anywhere. Rene Russo is in rare form with exceptional emotional moments through out the movie. Pierce plays an affluent Wall Street business man to a perfect T. With meant-to-be on-screen chemistry Brosnan and Russo are truly a pair to beat. The movie also includes fantastic cinematographic views of all scenes especially Manhattan and Martinique Island. It is a movie that will entertain all audiences older than 18. With two rather racy scenes you best put the kids to bed before starting this flick. Overall I give the movie 10 out of 10 stars. It's hard to beat this movie in any Genre. It even has comedic moments and is a true must see.</fullReview>

Russo on the other hand was of an extreme held back tension in her eyes which made her performance all the better. We all know less is better and thats what Renee did.La Russo as we Europeans tend to call her is of extreme capabilities and therefor should she quickly be cast in some Italian or french drama films.

		<fullReview>This film immediately became one of my Top 100 Favorite Films! The Brosnan/Russo on-screen chemistry is up there with Tracy/Hepburn, Grant/Kerr (An Affair To Remember), and Bogart/Bacall. The intricate plot twists are both entertaining and well-done, acting is superb and the ending is perfect. I hope another opportunity opens up to team Brosnan &amp; Russo again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake that is better than the Original!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thomas Crown Affair excels in being far better than the original. The camera-work, directing, music, acting. Almost everything about it has been pushed up at leat a notch from the 60's version.Casting Brosnan in the lead was a good idea, though he does seem to effortlessly move through the film. Almost a James Bond like character without the gun. Russo shines as the insurance investigator sent to trap Mr Crown(Brosnan) using her charm and her lovely figure. I think this role is perfect for her: she is so suductive and sexy. As a male i loved it. My Girlfriend however thought it was only quite good. My comments through the film probably didn't really help (mostly on Russo). And the sex scene certainly caught my attention. It is the first sex scene McTiernan has done.The script was witty, but what impressed me was the superb choice of shots McTiernan used:- the smoothness of the it all, the way everything ran perfectly. It suited it very well. Music was also great by Bill Conti it captured the essence of the glossy thriller.Watch The Thomas Crown Affair then watch the original and make up your mind. I think you will agree with my points. Fabulous film making 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Form without substance - typical feckless Hollywood remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original was not a great movie by any means and looks very dated, especially the 60's types of effects that were so popular then. The robbery subplot is not really that great or unique - there were other clever robbery flicks of the time which noone remembers or remakes. Even the disaffected Thomas Crowne character is also not really that remarkable. What does or I should say *did* set the film apart and worthy of remaking, was the interplay between Crowne and the Dunaway/Russo character culmunating in a wonderfully apt ending. Can she play chess (poker in the remake - an improvement..) with Crowne? Does she dare to risk all to win the ultimate prize, or can take the safe way out and take the sure thing?So what do they do in the remake? Glitz up the robbery - fair enough - even though it's not that plausible - it's not too bad. Add some skin - again understandable from a marketing viewpoint - but it was clumsily and gratuitously grafted into the film, providing no heat and detracting from the story. The actors were fine given what they were given and the addition of Dunaway to the cast was clever. However, the entire conflict between the two protagonists was so watered down as to be meaningless. No longer is it a conflict between two towering but *equal* titans (that's why the cops were there in the original: to show how stupid everyone else is compared to these two - something else lost in the remake). Instead, Russo has been reduced to a wronged woman chasing after the bad boy prince complete with retrofitted test-audience friendly ending. (I'd hate to see what these guys would do to Gone with the Wind or Casablanca...) Maybe Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan were originally supposed to be the leads...It's not surprising that other reviewers on this page found the film to be rather shallow - because without that conflict at the heart of the plot, all that is left is a styrofoam filled husk, though admittedly a nice shiny husk. In summary, not that bad a movie but certainly one that won't be remade in 30 years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is an abomination. I rated it as a two instead of a one only out of respect for McTiernan's "Die Hard" and "Hunt for Red October". It's terrible. Everything about it is terrible. The cinematography is wretched - and I don't think it's just my TV, but Russo and Brosnan frequently look bizarre and hideous. Bad makeup. Horrible wardrobe. Mediocre, at best, set design. The script makes TV, and in particular the WB Network, look smart by comparison... it's truly dreadful. Even the sound editing is poorly done and, well, gross - annoying sound effects (the chewing-with-the-mouth-open effects are always a nice touch) are overly loud while dialogue is frequently muddled. There are long, dreadful scenes of supposed "rich decadence" that are shockingly pedestrian. And, oh my sweet lord, don't get me started on the soundtrack. Oh, god, not the music! PLEASE just let me forget the music! Why do you torment me like this?!?Overall, the whole mess is compulsively unwatchable.In fact, the film is still playing as I write this. I'm making my girlfriend stick it out so she can fill me in on how bad it gets. I know, I know... but usually I *am* a good boyfriend. Honest.The last time I hated a movie this much it had to be the time I went to a test screening of "Nick of Time". Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken - hey, it sounded good. The only reason I didn't walk out of that one was because I was sitting next to a bombshell blonde, who was very interesting and talkative and almost totally ignored her obnoxious boyfriend to chat with me instead. That was fun. If it wasn't for her, I would've gladly walked out on that turkey. But at least "Nick of Time" had Christopher Walken.Well, my girlfriend just called me in to force me to watch the ending. It actually managed to exceed my expectations of how horrific it might be. I wonder if I can go back and change my vote to a one.So: if you enjoy film, don't be tempted to give this "hit" a try. I know what you're thinking... but don't. Trust me. It's not even worth renting just to make fun of. Just rent "Red October" or even "Predator" and pretend that John McTiernan is still making good movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dull, Boring, Overrated Mess of a Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could see that the people that did Thomas Crown Affair were going for a stylish, intriguing, sexy, and classy film. However, it just didn't work. The different "action" scenes (like when Thomas goes to steal the first painting) lacks flair or style - I immediately thought of comparing it to the opening sequence of Michael Mann's "Heat", and I noticed how little flair this movie has in it. Rene Russo's character is amazingly arrogant and snobbish - she did a pretty good job in the role (although it was not all that well written), but it's hard to like her. Pierce Brosnan did an okay job but his character wasn't that likable. The "cat and mouse game" the two were playing wasn't all that convincing - it just didn't seem like they had much chemistry.The sex sequences were overrated and dull, and they were also far too long - they didn't have to be in the film in this quantity. While I guess they were in there to try and emphasize the "cat and mouse" game that Brosnan and Russo were playing, the end result was just that the filmmakers were going for "shock value", because they were simply pointless.This movie was also saddled with one of the worst soundtracks I've ever heard - sequences that were intended to be intriguing and exciting were stuck with some of the worst "jazz" I've ever heard in my life. The music deflated the movie a great deal.In its credit, this movie did pick up at the very end (when Crown deliversthe stolen painting back), and it was enjoyable at the very end (although the music did hurt it a bit), but that doesn't help this too much (although I would have given it a 1 had the ending not been better). This movie lacked a sense of style to call its own, and it ended up being a cheap James Bond ripoff. Not recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not recall the first Thomas Crown film. But this one is bad (although lovely in photography) because of miscast actors. Pierce Brosman and Rene Russo don't belong in this film. They are both fine actors but Brosman lacks the image of a selfish man, and Russo is not a slut actress. Both of their strengths are class and intelligence. Now picture this flick with, oh, say, Val Kilmer and Angelina Jolie. THAT would be fireworks. Here, it's just pathetic to see such fine human beings cast as "take what you can" types. It just don't work, folks.I agree with others who point out the silliness of the plot. But it is hard for me to even consider the plot when I see Russo (or whoever) writhing all over a marble staircase. And what's with that obscene statue in the front hall of Crown's home? Please...is a guy into Monet also into in-your-face pornographic figures? Let's talk class here...at least that marble babe shouldn't be spread eagled in front of incoming guests. And what's with the pouty-faced model cast as the daughter of somebody or other in prison? Her smoldering looks and slinking on and off camera are hilarious. Yeah, like she's able to recreate the soul of Monet; she can't even crack a smile. She looks like a blond Dementor.Hey- I just had a thought: I continue to nominate another "sequal", "Lost Horizon" as the worst film ever made. BUT if the same crew who hatched that singing turkey really wanted to nail the title, why don't they put this "Thomas Crown Affair" to music! That would be the best thing since talkies. Oh, yes, and I agree about the Pepsi One performance. I found it offensive even before that commenter pointed out the ad.Not worth the popcorn, even if you're at home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring, clich卜, and predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't really enjoy this film.Pierce Brosnan plays a stereotypical, rich, arrogant businessman who enjoys art theft as a pastime. Right from the moment he meets Catherine Olds Banning, you can sense immediately that they will become romantically involved, and "live happily ever after", so to speak. You just knew he was going to be on board the plane at the end of the film, and that yet another romantic encounter would occur.Pierce Brosnan's finest moment was, obviously, Bond, but this was just a lacklustre performance which led to a dreary, formulaic film that was just boring to watch. During the first art theft, you knew right away that the professional art thieves were all going to get caught, but Pierce Brosnan was obviously going to get away with effectively "stealing" their crime, leaving them to the mercy of the police and gallery guards.The scenes at the end of the film, involving the many men in bowler hats was purely ridiculous and, in my mind, unnecessary. It was the usual overdone glamour that plagues Brosnan films, the same effects as observed within the Bond movies.On the whole, the plot left nothing to the imagination - most things were far too obvious. The script was full of the usual cheesy clich乶 that you'd usually expect, and everything was too far-fetched to be anything like entertaining.Dreadful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Throwing Money at Something Is No Guarantee of Success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard that they were going to remake The Thomas Crown Affair, I inevitably asked: "What was wrong with the old one?" Nevertheless, I tried to watch the remake with an open mind.The impression I got was that the film makers had decided to make this film different by throwing some extra money at it. Thus the settings are more opulent, and we have the added expense of fine art rather than just a cheapo bank robbery. We have gliders,islands in the sun, even an expensive catamaran capsizing. Whereas, in the original film, we had a genuine chemistry between Steve McQueen and Faye Dunnaway, especially during the chess playing scene, in this film there is as much chemistry between Pearce Brosnan and Rene Russo as there is between Pearce Brosnan and Garry Kasparov!The film should never have been made, and, unless you like looking at opulent scenery, you would be better watching the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a waste of two hours. I never understood the need for remakes and this one definitely gives proof to my non understanding. To say that that this is a bad movie would be to give it a practically a rave. This goes beyond bad, just think of how many starving children that could have been fed with the money that it took to make this tripe. First you have the Bond guy who steals a picture, and a (what the filmmakers thought) sexy investigator, perhaps less close ups so that we couldn't see the lines on her face, would have only improved this sorry excuse of a film. Anyway she's on to him from the beginning and we go through a series of dates, getaways, jealous fits, all culminating in an ending which is even dumber than the rest of the movie, if that's humanly possible. So he returns the painting, (sort of) but steal another in a way that not even Houdini could have done, (no wonder they don't show you how he did it)and they live happily ever after. Movies such as these are infuriating because they steal two hours from peoples lives and not even apologize for it. I think I may want to make a movie, for I couldn't do any worst than this piece of #*%@!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a remake in every sense of the word. ie: they took a perfectly good film and made it again. This film is a cover not a remix and one where all members of the band lack the charisma and talent of the original. The original film is a heist movie about a millionaire industrialist type who runs a very tight art-theft operation, purely for his own enjoyment. The interesting bits are when an insurance investigator is set on him and they spar over the ethics of the "caper, sir". It's light on the surface, but has depth if you care to pay attention. They soundtrack also tells a story and syncs beautifully with the scenes in the film - like the game of chess between the two apparent adversaries and the song "His eyes, Her eyes". The chess game is one of the many innuendos of predator and prey, outwitting and seducing at the same time. The remake fails dismally because it lamely attempts to reproduce the soundtrack and casts the leads as caricatures of Steve and Faye - even down to a terrible impersonation by Pierce Brosnan of Steve's laugh which is so awful both my wife and I hit the floor in hysterics. The dodgy "brand new" sounding 'smooth jazz' sax in the soundtrack is simply awful, any sax player knows you have to go dig a horn out of the fifties if you want the best sound, this film is almost a like one of those dodgy Star Wars spoofs over at ifilm, simply laughable. 1/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR / (1999) ***Starring: Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo, Denis Leary, Frankie Faison, Fritz Weaver, and Faye Dunaway Directed by John McTiernan. Written by Leslie Dixon and Kurt Wimmer. Running time: 113 minutes. Rated R (for sexuality, nudity, and some language). "The Thomas Crown Affair" is a production of clever writing and sly, unconventional twists, with a sneaky and lightweight plot. It begins on a positive note through style, high stakes and crucial events, and concludes with some of the same kind of material. The only flaws in the production are a lot of flat dialogue, a slow moving, non-progressive second act, and unnecessary scenes that only distract us from the true theme of action. If not for these problems, we would have had one heck of a mystery thriller that may have played with our minds like a curious cat with a spool of string.  The movie begins with a rich sense of visual action and enticement. The Metropolitan Museum of Art is the setting, where a filthy rich individual named Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) burglarizes the building of a Monet worth over one hundred million dollars. Within this first rate setup, the producers grant us several twists and turns, unexpected occurrences, but little character development. The official assigned to this complicated case is Michael McCann (Denis Leary), who teams up with an insurance investigator named Catherine Banning (Rene Russo). When Catherine meets Thomas at a banquette, her skepticism arises about this man, who has nearly everything money can accommodate. However, Crown has devised a foul proof heist with the Monet, and it will be very difficult for anyone to prove he committed the crime. Although conviction is not her main goal, she attempts to seduce her way inside the Crown mansion to examine the artifacts there, and possibly convince the thief to return the painting so that her company doesn't have to write an enormous check.  Crown and Banning become closer. She becomes more suspicious. He teases her with clues and temptations along their cat and mouse chase. Eventually, he takes her to his resort in the tropics where they exchange outcomes and gather information about each other. Complications ensue when she suspects Tom to have another mistress, and she reluctantly becomes overly involved in his status, and is forced to choose between the life of an insurance investigator or Thomas Crown's partner.  A lot of the second act includes wasted time through scene after scene consisting of cat and mouse-like material. These wondering sequences do develop chemistry, but really do not move the story forward. There are also segments that clarify Thomas Crown's motives, treating us like slowwitted dummies, through intercut visits with an unclassified psychiatrist (Faye Dunaway). Naturally, these demonstrations are meaningless, and contribute nothing to the story.The casting is perfect, eminently with Pierce Brosnan as the title character, who performs with elegance and style. He presents his character with firm knowledge of the script and scenarios. Rene Russo is also devilishly clever, handling her role with glamorous style, and charming intimacy. Surprisingly overlooked here is Denis Leary's character. He doesn't induce much intrigue here because he is a puppet of the plot."The Thomas Crown Affair" may embody style and allure, but much of the dialogue is flat. Many of the conversations only restate what is already obvious, thus obtain in a dreary, dual fashion. Although, aside from the unsuccessful soundtrack, I did enjoy a lot of the movie's 匐lat, it did have somewhat of a smarty pants tone throughout. It is almost if the film thinks it is better than it actually is. The film is directed by John McTiernan, whose most famous credits include "Medicine Man" (1992), "The Hunt for Red October" (1990), "Last Action Hero" (1993), two of the Die Hard films, and the more recent "The 13th Warrior." Coming from a mostly belligerent individual, I was expecting something more action packed with Crown. Instead we receive more romantic chemistry than action, and more intellect than injury. Whereas "The Thomas Crown Affair" is not a remarkable movie, I even struggle to recommend it, I still enjoyed enough of the overall presentation to call it "good." Actually, if the sex was handled with more discrepancy, "The Thomas Crown Affair" could possibly pass as the next James Bond installment.Brought to you by MGM Productions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thomas Crown Affair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen this remake prior to seeing the original Steve McQueen caper version, and to be honest, I prefer the more fast-paced and raunchy version, from director John McTierman (Die Hard, Predator). Basically Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) is the self-made millionaire with everything he could want, who likes to steal priceless art paintings in his spare time. After a recent theft from the Claude Monet museum it is up to insurance investigator Catherine Banning (Rene Russo) to uncover key suspect Crown in a cat and mouse game. Soon enough it is obvious that she can't resist the charming playboy, and they end up sleeping together, and start enjoying glider rides over country, cruising in his expensive car, and holidaying for three days in Martinique. There is a point where Thomas asks Catherine to go away with him, confessing anything she wants to know to be with her, and he proposes a day he can be caught or left alone at the museum he robbed before. This is a setup though and he manages to arrange many other men to wear the same getup-up as him, and he disappears, only to reappear behind Catherine on her at first sad flight, so it is a then happy ending (unlike the original, no back together there). Also starring Denis Leary as Detective Michael McCann, Anatomy of a Murder's Ben Gazzara as Andrew Wallace, Frankie Faison as Detective Paretti, Fritz Weaver as John Reynolds, Charles Keating as Friedrich Golchan, Mark Margolis as Heinrich Knutzhorn and Faye Dunaway (star of the original) as The Psychiatrist. It might not have the quite sexy chess playing scene, but it has a quite racy first sex scene, and Brosnan and Russo make a very sexy couple, and it has much more modern ways to tell the story. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good try, but ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake can be as good as the original, but its tough to do. After all, if the original was good enough to inspire a remake, the remake has to outdo the original. The 1967 original of "The Thomas Crown Affair" is one of my all-time favorites. I saw a "sneak preview" of the 1999 remake this evening, and it doesn't quite hit the mark. Rene Russo as Catherine Banning is much "harder" than Faye Dunaway was as Vicki Anderson. Denis Leary as Detective Michael McCann is almost a clone of Paul Burke as Eddy Malone. This is the 1990s, and everyone needs a shrink. Casting Faye Dunaway as Thomas Crown's analyst was a cute touch. But where is the Jack Weston character, Erwin? It would be hard to compete with Michel Legrand's soundtrack in the 1967 original (I still keep a tape of it in my car) and, except for a couple of versions of Legrand's "Windmill of Your Mind," the 1999 version doesn't come close. And what about all those commercial references? Pepsi. Lucent. Bulgari. Way too obvious, especially in the catamaran racing scene. If the real Thomas Crown was competing against a boat with "Lucent" on it's spinnaker, wouldn't his say "Crown Acquisitions?" Considering that this is only the second film produced by Pierce Brosnan (and only the first for general audiences), he did an acceptable job. But Brosnan is no Steve McQueen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone around here raves about how great this remake is, how brilliant and smart and witty and sexy it is. I thought the plot was lacking in every possible department and that the overall effect was very un-sexy.Well, the story (as it were) is about gentleman thief Thomas Crown (Brosnan, moon-lighting from James Bond) getting into all sorts of mischief. Russo plays the insurance investigator out to get him, and instead gets into bed with him, or rather in the hallway, the stairs, his office, his desk and everywhere else in his home. Pierce Brosnan is competent enough in his role as the gentleman thief, but Rene Russo doesn't seem to know what the hell she's doing in this film. You know I'm glad that Rene feels comfortable taking her clothes off after age 40 and all that, but it's a shame that she picked such a bad movie to do it in. Plus that had to be the worst sex scene I've ever seen; I was literally on the verge of throwing up. The climax with Brosnan and a group of men who look like him and dress like him trying to distract the "good guys" who are watching from the security cameras is mildly interesting. But overall, skip it.</fullReview>
