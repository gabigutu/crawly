		<shortDescription>Unforgettable 60's cool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is for fans of the 60s era not just 60's movies. It is a vehicle for displaying McQueen's cool and Dunaway's style. Made and set in an age when only the hippest were members of the jet set. Besides the two stars, look for solid performances from a very young Yaphet Kotto and the always disgusting Jack Weston.The film itself is well crafted, beautifully photographed and brilliantly directed, it also has a great score. Jewison makes use of the split screen effect, several places in the film. While not only visually interesting, it also captures something of the essence of the era. Few people today will realise the significance of the split screen effect, as they don't remember Montreal's Expo/67.While essentially a cool heist flic, and one of the first, this film is much more. It is a subtle study of human behaviour and the basic characteristics of man and woman. McQueen is the bored rich playboy and Dunaway is the cool, yet seductive private eye, who is not above using her feminine charms to solve a case. From time to time, the film hints at Crown's inner crisis, he is constantly in need of distraction, to prevent himself from dwelling on the fact that his life is essentially empty and meaningless.Throughout the film, McQueen and Dunaway play a cat and mouse game, both on the professional level and also on the sexual level. The sexual tension during the chess game for example is so palpable, you can't help but be drawn in, dwelling on every stroke of Dunaway's fingers and every twitch on McQueen's face.Unlike the modern remake, which is vapid by comparison, this film forces the viewer to pay attention, or risk missing the whole point. The pace of the original is much slower than the remake, and so might not appeal to those raised on video games.The ending of this film gives us some real insight into the true nature of the relationships between men and women.Overall, this film is a modern masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Favored over the remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The large number of reviews tossing this in the trash bin as an overwrought 1960s period piece, or inferior when compared to the Pierce Brosnan/Rene Russo remake caused me to find the DVD and take another look.The problem with the 1967 film is that, unlike most films made today (including the remake), viewers need to think and connect the dots; and, there isn't always a "right" ending with all details neat and tidy. This is still a classic of the caper films, with McQueen giving the definitive performance of his absolute-cool image, and Dunaway as the Joan Crawford of the Virginia Slims generation.The then-innovative parts of the film, including the multiple split screens and the repetition of the theme song with Noel Harrison look dated (and the split-screen is only effective on the big, big screens of the 1960s-era theaters), but the chess game is still the most-seductive bit of film where all the clothes stay on and nobody talks.Listening to director Norman Jewison's commentary on the DVD is enlightening. The split screens were indeed a timely gimmick (Jewison and the producer saw the technique at Expo '67 in Montreal), and his explanation of the last scene in the cemetery gives a good insight as to how he aimed the film in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tense, stylish, serious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film about games: the defining image, a game of chess; and then, as well, the intellectual game that robbery provides for Crown (McQueen), and the two games, professional and sexual, in which Vicki and Crown stalk each other. For these players, games are very serious and the outcome of each uncertain.The film is of its time, but works in ours, as well and better than the recent remake. Those looking for a fast action "heist" movie will be disappointed: this film is about alienation and attraction, trust and betrayal, about working out what matters - all those eternal themes. It will appeal to those content to focus on personal chemistry unpunctuated by regular gunfire. None the less, the planning and execution of the bank robbery is cleverly done and provides sufficient impetus to drive the rest of the straightforward plot. Crown's motivations, tedium and greed, are readily understandable; Vicki's are similar. As people they are similar and evenly matched. Vicki is stylish and beautiful and, using her sexuality as well as her intellect, she is Crown's equal or better - which is not true of the remake. In the end, it is she who defines the outcome, but what it will be and why Vicki makes the choice she does are left unresolved. So, too, we remain uncertain whether the possibility truly exists, that their alienation might be healed.The focus is clearly on the couple. Eddy Malone's role as the police detective does not extend beyond that of a Greek chorus, providing the conventional and moral reference against which the actions of the principals are to be judged. Jack Weston's Erwin, a very worried getaway driver, simply contrasts the player of the game, Crown, with the instruments with which he plays it.The performances of the entire cast are exemplary. McQueen's clipped manner builds the tension and intensifies the effect of his weakening to Vicki's seductive moves during the chess game. The role of Vicki is perfect for Dunaway, making no great demands on her to project herself, no extended dialogue, which she does not generally manage well; but the disposition of her body, her power of gesture, and her brief, pithy statements all work brilliantly. Jack Weston produces an excellent cameo performance that pretty well had me perspiring as much as he was. Malone plays a straight role straight, the way it should be.The split screen title sequence and passages in the film work well; they do not distract, as this technique can, but are used to capture and compress moments of action that are significant but do not require extended treatment. The Legrand soundtrack is brilliantly effective, including the long passages of real tension, without music.This really is a great classic, a film that will endure, and those who have difficulty with it should see it again and allow themselves the time to be seduced by its low key perfection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Crown Affair is an Under-rated Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to write this comment after reading the other comment about this fantastic film. You must watch this with the anticipation of someone about to relish an intricate and complex dish, with the feel of The Italian Job in mind, with the knowledge that Steve McQueen is the epitome of cool (see the Tao of Steve), and with the desire to see Movie Making as it should be. This is at base a heist movie, but with Steve at the helm as a wealthy businessman who is in it for kicks, you ride along with him and enjoy his every conquest of Faye Dunaway. The "Chess with Sex" scene is very sensual and has been mimicked in many movies (Austin Powers). The soundtrack is fantastic and I think "Windmills of Your Mind" won an Oscar for Best Soundtrack. The multi-split-screen views are, in my opinion, very clever as they tell different parts of the story whilst building the suspense, as well as looking very stylish. The ending is not confusing, it is intriguing, bittersweet, tantalising, and surprising. Watch and enjoy, those in the know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Movie Even If Out of Character for McQueen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot think of anything that I did not like about the TCA. I read some of the other reviews, and I can understand why they might come to their conclusions to the contrary.First, McQueen does look a little out of character being a financier, but as in most of his other roles, he is in control of the situation. He plays the loner outside of the situation and/or system. Even the women that came into his arms are issued temporary visa only as shown by Faye Dunaway left holding the bag at the end of the movie. He played her like a violin.Someone mentioned that they hated the multiple shots used in several scenes, and that it was overused and probably pointless. I completely disagree. I think that it adds dimension and excitement when it used. During the robbery, the viewer can witness several aspects of the caper as it unfolds. The polo shots were fantastic and exciting.To me McQueen was a bit of a mystery. What did he really want? "Kicks" as suggested by Paul Burke the police investigator? He told Faye Dunaway that it was he against the system, which leaves me a little less than satisfied. He certainly seemed to be bored. Everything came to him too easily.Faye Dunaway started out great with the pitbull attitude toward reclaiming the money for the insurance reward. I liked the repartee at the initial meeting with McQueen at the art auction. I felt she showed weakness at their first dinner meeting when McQueen accused her of having a "funny, dirty little mind". The surveillance, "replacing the carpet" in his mansion and IRS audits forever were good blows she landed. McQueen always seemed to be one step ahead. Even before the last robbery when he said he had to know where she stood, I think he already was on the plane to Europe without her. For Faye, it was a lose-lose situation. Whether she ever was really in love with him or not, she got far to close to draw the line.The chess scene in McQueen's den was probably the sexiest scene I have ever witnessed. Everything occurred in the viewer's mind -- no nudity or anything more than kiss on screen.This movie was wonderful, a very good look at a refreshing look at the 60s with wealth and power. Even cigarette smoking had not become a pariah.PS: I saw the Pierce Brosnan version of TCA, and it was zero in my estimation, and that was with the nudity. Don't waste your time on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Affair To Remember</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "Thomas Crown Affair" directed by Norman Jewison is one of the coolest movies ever made and great fun for all of its 100 minutes - a clever bank-heist caper combined with the sensual romance where both participants (the brilliant bank robber and his match, the sultry and shrewd insurance investigator) are sophisticated, quick-witted and oh so cool. The split-screen technique really works well in this movie and I should mention the song "The Windmills of Your Mind" by Michel Legrand that very deservingly received an Oscar - and it does not happen often in the best song categories.The chess game between "King Of Cool" Steve McQueen and 27 year old Faye Dunaway in the most provocative dress possible is one of the sexiest and most exiting without actual sex involved (my favorite kind of scenes - let my imagination work, let everything happen in my mind) scenes ever filmed. IMO, the 60s was one of the best dressed decades ever with the first wave of mini (and I mean it) skirts and elegant suits and dresses. From Faye Dunaway's interview to "USA Today" about working with McQueen, "We had the most magical spark. Our hearts and souls combined. There was no romance off screen but on screen it was like a smack."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Perfect Crime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thomas Crown affair begs the question. What do the rich think of when they are bored? Norman Jewison decided to answer that question with a subtle, but over the top version of cops and robbers. Thomas Crown (suprisingly, but adroitly played by Steve McQueen) is a bored, millionaire who asks, "Who do I want to be tomorrow?" To that end, he decides on 'kicks.' In what seems like an absentminded challenge to himself, Crown designs and implements a down to the minute bank robbery. The plan is fantastic. He selects and hires five total strangers at random, instructs them on their part of the Bank robbery, then sets them in motion. What follows is perhaps the finest cat and mouse crime game between two intelligent and sophisticated players. Faye Dunaway plays Vicki Anderson, a top notch insurance investigator who for ten percent of recovered loot promises the capture of her agile quarry. Standing by to arrest the elusive Crown is Paul Burke, who plays Lt. Edward 'Eddy' Malone. Jack Weston portrays Erwin Weaver the get-a-way driver who could jeopardize Crowns Perfect crime. With the famous, "Windmills of your Mind" theme song, the viewer is hauntingly allowed into the mind of a sympathetic man and one cannot help but root for the thief. This film was McQueen's favorite. *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazing movie. I give movies a 10 when I can come up with no suggestion at all to make it better. The cinematography, editing, dialogue, acting, costumes, locations and most of all direction of this movie are perfect. A definite must see if you are a fan of James Bond or risk taking films such as The Graduate and Rosemary's Baby. After you watch it, make sure to watch the remake which simply pales in comparison. The two together are a perfect example of what we loose from the comtemporary Hollywood blockbuster formula.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best psychopath portrayals ever (spoiler alert!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steve McQueen gives one of the best portrayals of a psychopath ever, whether he intended to or not. Whether it's his game playing with the authorities... his pulling off the crime to see if he can (there is no true profit motive here... he has more money than he knows what to do with), all are classic behaviours. But the TRUE telling is in the scene where... after tormenting the cops... Crown tries to laugh. It's as though he knows he's supposed to be maniacally happy, but doesn't know how to achieve it. And everything he goes through as far as the 'love affair' goes... and sets her up to leave her and escape... pure non-conscious behaviour. The movie may SEEM dated with time... but the portrayal is as accurate as any you will ever find.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bored decadent rich man plays games with ordinary peoples lives for no other reason than he can. A not very likable premise for a movie but it is very popular. Used as an epitome of coolness - with laddish aspirations of greatness gleamed from it for a couple of generations of bored not-so-bright 'Man-children'. I know that many males identify with Steve McQueen maybe because he is your average joe in looks ( verging on ugly ) and his diminutive size ( 5'9 ) is very appealing and non-threatening. His characters drive fast and don't give a damn about anybody - anti-hero pinup boy - an adolescents wet dream. Beneath his supposedly cool laconic exterior, this actor seems to hide a blank interior rather like the character he plays in this film. He is the ultimate lad. Listen to him chortle to himself on his prowess when he returns to his mansion after the heist- some of the saddest acting I have seen in awhile. In fact right up there with his performance in the chess scene - which is laughably bad - but then maybe thats the point ? From the frame within a frame nonsense to that farcical theme tune, it's lame entertainment. The female protagonist/foil is either a sexual object to be won or a non-ethical money scheming femme fatale who is bright but obviously confused by his big kid magnetism. The film ups and turns with a very predictable and ludicrous plot, the film makers made every character one dimensional and dislikable, again maybe on purpose - something for the Lads, budding crooks and capitalists to 'empathise with' ( or is that an oxymoron ? ) In the end the Bored decadent rich man leaves to sunnier climes with all the cash - ( He is bored with everything, cares for nothing and nobody cares for him. ) As the girl cries, caught between an ethical dilemma, her lust and the reward she's lost - he smirks in his getaway plane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thomas Crown Affair on Reel 13</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oddly enough, I had only seen the John McTiernan remake of THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR and while I realize it wasn't a masterpiece, I found it an entertaining and enjoyable caper. I just assumed that the original would be superior in every way and was excited about its airing on Reel 13 last night. After all, Norman Jewison, Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway seem like a late sixties dream team (Jewison was coming off of directing the Best Picture Oscar-winner the year before ? IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT). Instead, the film had absolutely no emotional impact on me at all and left me surprised, bewildered and severely disappointed.At first, I couldn't figure out where it went awry. I kept wanting to like it, expecting it to turn a corner and pique my interest, but then, before I knew what hit me, it was over. It starts promisingly enough with a clever bank heist, but Crown isn't physically involved in the robbery and we never really see him planning it in any way, so he's sort of passive, as heroes go, especially given it's essentially the only heist in the film (the second one at the end is a quickly cut carbon copy of the first). Then, Faye Dunaway, as insurance investigator Vicki Anderson, solves the mystery of the robbery WAY too easily. She walks in, looking young and stunning in several ridiculous overly fashionable outfits, bats her eyes and more or less decides that Crown is the guilty party. So, the two major elements of any crime - the crime and the investigation ? are rushed through and devoid of any suspense whatsoever.It's almost as if Jewison was in a rush to get to the longest scene in the film ? the sexy chess match, which Norman clearly was setting up as the not-so-subtle metaphor of the movie (Did Dunaway really need to suggestively stroke one of the phallic-looking chess pieces? Cheeee-sy). It was around this time that it occurred to me that it's not supposed to be a cops and robbers movie as much as it was supposed to be a love story. That's fine, in theory, but even their relationship scenes are rushed. He gives her a dune buggy ride on the beach and suddenly, they're soulmates? Sorry, I don't buy it.I'm most disappointed in Jewison, who normally is such a stickler for detail and is so careful in his storytelling. Here, he seems more interested in the natural beauty of both his lead actors than in the plot. Even the device he employs early in the film of dividing the screen into boxes falls flat or rather, he doesn't use it to advance the story (like the current television show "24" does a great job of). While he does have several things going on at once ? the robbery comes at the bank from five different angles ? he would instead chooses to use his four of his blocks to show Steve McQueen and the rest are out of focus. Then, when all of Crown's pawns are at different places in the bank, Jewison returns to full frame shooting at a time where the blocks might have really been useful/effective. Stylistic choices like that need to serve the story, not to show off the director's ability to do tricks.I can almost see why McTiernan felt like it was a necessary film to remake. The plot has a lot of potential ? extremely wealthy man plots bank robberies (or in the case of the remake ? art heists) and then meets his match when an attractive, intelligent insurance investigator becomes the first to suspect him. Sounds great, doesn't it? But this original version barely scratches the surface of that juicy plot and invests more time in Michel Legrand's bizarre rhythmless song "Windmills in My Mind" (connecting Crown to Don Quixote). If you want a fun caper movie (I never thought I would say this), rent the remake. Norman Jewison has made a lot of great films, but he really bungled this one.(For more information on this film or any other Reel 13 film, check out their website on www.reel13.com)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit too dated...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw this tonight. Without revisiting the plot, it is very much a product of the 60s. Style is everything, substance nothing. Mr. McQueen is shown variously sail planing, vigorously piloting a dune buggy, playing polo, or tooling around in his Ferrari or Rolls. Ms. Dunaway apparently has an unlimited clothing budget, wearing a new high-fashion outfit and looking suitably glamorous in every scene. The other actors seem chosen for their drab workaday appearances, providing a suitable contrast with the stars.The action is hardly worth speaking of but drags quite a bit in places. There are plenty of stylistic echoes of the James Bond movies of the era, or of the early Pink Panther films (this is a Mirisch production after all), but without the saving grace of humor. The moral message is that it's OK to steal if you steal big and with style. Not the first movie telling us that. Worse, the "chemistry" between the two stars totally fails to work.I'm a Steve McQueen fan, but this is not the best movie for his or perhaps anybody's talents. Three stars at best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thomas Crown is a mysterious gazillionaire who is frankly bored with his life. What to do when you're a thirty something and have all the resources available. For a lark, plan the perfect crime. So in The Thomas Crown Affair, Steve McQueen does just that. He recruits four people at random for the crime, none of whom know each other and pull off a really neat bank robbery.It seems like Paul Burke and the Boston PD aren't getting the job done so the bank brings in Faye Dunaway as an insurance investigator. She does this for a 10% finders fee, not for a policeman's salary. She also doesn't have to follow the rules the way the cops do.Dunaway is smart and she does figure out it's McQueen who's the mastermind. She baits him in some of the same way that Inspector Slimane baits Pepe LeMoko. Of course she really gets up close and personal in a way that Slimane couldn't. All this really does get to Paul Burke, whose performance is unfortunately overlooked in talking about The Thomas Crown Affair.It's a battle of hubris between McQueen and Dunaway and the film does keep you in some suspense as to who will win out.The Thomas Crown Affair garnered won Academy Award for Michel LeGrand's song, The Windmills of Your Mind. It's a stylishly done caper film and I guarantee you won't be able to anticipate the outcome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I caught this movie on TV last night and was so surprised by how much I had forgotten--except for the chiffon halter dress that Faye Dunaway wears--that had been seared into my 13-year-old mind as the height of chic in 1968. The previous comment said she was too distant and cold. Well, she was an insurance investigator, not a daycare provider. This was 1968 when women really had to be businesslike to make their way in the world and this also is the image of the writer of her character. What I loved was the minimalist dialog, the incredible lighting and composition in every frame (Haskell Wexler's genius at work), especially during the best scene ever of a chess match. This was totally film as film--it was a scene that could only come to life in film. It was such a pleasure to see a filmmaker rely on the photography, music and facial expressions of the actors to build a scene instead of another bang up car crash. The camera loved both actors' faces, but especially Steve McQueen's cragginess and leanness. I love witty dialog, but this minimalist approach worked because it fit the characters. And the end was perfect because it totally fit the characters. She was an investigator and just because she fell in love she wasn't prepared or able to abandon the way she had lived her life--within the law. He couldn't abandon his life choices either, because he'd only end up in jail without her anyway. A happy ending would have meant she was an entirely different person than we were led to believe. I think this movie stands the test of time incredibly well and as a piece of how you can film two people in a room nearly without dialog and make it interesting and erotic, well it's a treasure. .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flat as Dunaway's bosom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie clomps through some dated sixties tropes: that women need to use their sex appeal as much as their intelligence; that seducing a man is merely a technique; and that, in the end, women are slaves to their feminine feelings.Both actors are miscast--McQueen because he's anything but suave and debonair (there's only one Cary Grant), because he's unattractive in closeup, showing tobacco-engraved wrinkles and sun damage (there's only one Cary Grant!), and because he plays only one character, that of the smirking bad boy. You don't rise in the Boston Brahmin banking echelon and maintain that persona. His performance started skidding with his faked hysterical laughter and never regained traction.Faye Dunaway delivers her lines with the skill and conviction of a Jackie Gleason chorus girl, swings her miniskirted hips and fondles herself with sixties-era "nude" fingernail polish, but she's out of her depth. Her hairdos recall Princess Leia's cinnamon buns in surreal bulk. It's worth remembering that, like Cybill Shepherd, she was a fashion model to start with, and can't stop composing her flawless features into camera-ready freezes.The plot is sketchy, the motivation unclear, the supporting characters, particularly the heist men, left unexplored with the exception of Jack Weston's sweaty Erwin. Even Crown's motivation is barely hinted at. You don't care that Vicki loses her man in the end, and I actually wished for Crown to get his comeuppance--then, at least, McQueen's bad-boy insouciance would have something to work itself on.Gimmicks like split-screen, slow dissolves, and the psychedelic colors (the costuming is particularly hideous, putting Dunaway in stale-coffee shades of beige and black, and minor characters in the ugliest of lime, orange, and pink) don't annoy as much when viewed as artifacts of a particularly dismal time in fashion and film--they arouse a more indulgent compassion, like what we experience looking at old high-school pictures of heaped-high hairdos, narrow short trouser legs, and garish makeup.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This seems to be one of those flics that garners both fervent adherents and choruses of raspberries. It certainly has its faults, but I thought it was still quite a good movie (7/10) overall.The plot unfortunately is pretty far removed from reality. No amount of money could persuade five men to lay their lives on the line for someone they couldn't even pick out of a lineup. Nor can we really begin to believe that Vicki can so quickly put her finger on Thomas Crown as the man behind it all.There would have been better choices for the Thomas Crown role...most obviously Cary Grant, except I think he had just retired. But McQueen acquits (ahem) himself well.The chess sequence alone is worth the price of admission (hard to believe anyone could miss the erotic tension in that scene...though it is tame enough today), the issues of trust and betrayal are explored in an interesting way, and the ending is clever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disgusting, fraudulent film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is significant that the least cool film by Steve McQueen, King of Cool, is the one in which he strives hardest to be cool. Of course, effort is the antithesis of cool. I had expected to enjoy this film as a frothy 60s pop-artefact in the ARABESQUE vein, but it is tedious and gauchely unchic. Director Jewison has subsequently proven himself to be bereft of interest in his later career, but he confuses ripping off adventurous film-makers with being adventurous himself.The film is NOT stylish, which is its claim to fame - its devices are irritating, its form is not aligned to an artistic point of view, the colour is ugly, the unravelling of plot is insultingly implausible, its use of stars is hopeless. Faye Dunaway, bristling with sexuality in BONNIE AND CLYDE, is an unloveable mannequin in this film, with an appalling taste in clothes. Steve McQueen, one of the great actors, is completely wrong for this film, lacking the necessary dark suavity of a Cary Grant. These characters are ciphers, without history, motivation or even charm: Thomas Crown plans a heist for kicks - at one point he hilariously suggests that he is fighting the 'system' - a $4 million capitalist dealing in property and currency!The film tries amid the inept gloss to make some 'serious' points - capitalism is linked to crime and death; Crown, successful businessman, has a dark, split personality (lots of mirror/frame shots, hysterical laughing, split-screens). The use of this latter device is annoying and uninventive - unlike the complexity of Greenaway's THE PILLOW BOOK, in which multiple images disorient the viewer with unexpected juxtapositions and disruptions of time and space, the images here are all narratively coherent and hence redundant. The flashy direction is so satisfied with itself that it bungles the tension and excitement in not one, but TWO heist sequences, surely an expected skill in the 60s.Compare this film to the amazing CHARADE, a genuinely stylish 60s film, which, while tongue-in-cheek, played its thrills straight; incorporated its stylistic and fashionable elements to visualise a growing desire between its two stars (Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant were invented for this kind of film), who provide a genuine, touching, playful attraction, which evokes enormous audience goodwill, without resorting to gimmicks like the chess sequence, which is possibly meant to be funny, because it's certainly not erotic.Although Jewison probably wanted to replicate the freshness and romance of an early Nouvelle Vague film, he has only succeeded in emulating that egotistical fraud Claud Lelouch. Like that purveyor of insipid, 'significant', romances, the only saving grace is the beautifully schmaltzy score, this one by Michel Legrand (although for real Legrand beauty, check out LES PARAPLUIES DE CHERBOURG).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember the advertising campaign for this film on the big screen: "What do you give the man who has everything?"THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR was an unusual departure for Steve McQueen. All of his characters (even the military ones) were middle class types. Thomas Crown, his anti-hero here, is a very wealthy banker in Boston. He plays polo. He is an art collector. He knows all the right people, and has all the right connections. But he is bored. He has to do something unusual. So he decides to commit the perfect crime: he is going to rob his own bank. And for the first twenty minutes of the film we watch a well planned robbery get carried out. Crown has chosen total strangers as his assistants, and he has gotten first rate equipment for them. The result is that the police (represented by Eddie Malone, played by Paul Burke) are stumped. Enter the investigator for the insurance company who have had to make good on the robbery, and want the money back. This investigator is Vicki Anderson (played by Faye Dunaway). Vicki is a lady who enjoys her job of solving crimes, particularly those that the police can't get a grip on. But she is determined to get a solution at all costs. Although Eddie appreciates her work, he is also appalled at her methods. Here he soon sees the fruits of them. Vicki and Eddie have one slender clue - a flabby nonentity named Erwin (Jack Weston) was identified as driving away from the robbery site. Erwin suddenly has plenty of money to spend, and has bought a new station wagon. Vicki arranges for Erwin's car to get stolen (he is tripped by one of the thugs she hires), and later has his son kidnapped to force Erwin to make a deal with her and the police. Eddie is not happy about this effective but illegal method of getting information.Vicki has also settled on the crime being an inside one, and the most likely candidate being Crown. She decides to romance him into a weak position and then arrest him. When Eddie confronts on the lack of morality in this Vicki defends her actions because the world is immoral.But what she does not count on is herself. Vicki is not all bad (she even apologizes for her high handedness to Erwin), and she is as susceptible to charm as others. And Crown is charming, especially in his milieu of a Beacon Hill mansion with brandy before the fire, or midnight lobster fries on Cape Cod. Soon she is falling for him, and Eddie is wondering if she is still as effective regarding Crown as she has previously been on other cases. And Crown certainly is not totally accepting the situation. He keeps pointing out her operatives to her when they are together. The film is headed to a fatalistic conclusion: will Crown be caught by Vicki and the police, or will he destroy himself, or will he escape? No matter which conclusion, is there a future for Thomas Crown and Vicki Anderson?The film works, despite the odd casting of McQueen as one born to the purple. It is not a real stretch for him, but he rarely came back to it (his role in THE TOWERING INFERNO is his next professional man of any upper class stature). He seems to fit the role well, but one wonders if he felt happy with it. His best known film role for 1968 was not Thomas Crown but Bullitt, his troubled but determined detective.Dunaway (fresh from her triumph in BONNY AND CLYDE) is showing she is capable of performing as an upper class insurance investigator. She certainly shows the slow divisions in her own personality as she sees the immorality of her hunting a man she's fallen in love with.Burke's characterization is between two points: he really dislikes muddying the waters of police investigation by actions that are illegal, but he likes Dunaway (who has worked with him before) and swallows this. But he also notes her changing feelings toward McQueen, and his anger develops a small degree of jealousy. In fact, at one point, he enjoys showing that McQueen has been followed three nights a week going to a call girl. Dunawasy tries to not be dismayed by this.In the wake of the 1999 remake, this earlier film has been pushed out of the memories of most film lovers. It is not one of the greatest detective films, and may not be among the best loved McQueen or Dunaway performances, but it holds up well. It is also fitting to have one of the best theme songs ever composed for a movie: "The Windmills of Your Mind."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sadly, it did not age well...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this on word-of-mouth advice many months before the release of the 1999 remake. Eventually, I found both movies disappointing, but the original was more so.Maybe it's because I was expecting a heist flick, and the heist, while well done, only takes up about the first 10-15 minutes of the movie. The rest is supposed to be romantic drama, but I really just found it dull.Maybe it's because, after the heist bit, we really get to know Thomas Crown, and he turns out to be a chauvinist jerk. Steve McQueen's hep-cat character has aged quite badly. The second half of the movie is pretty much split between Thomas Crown fooling around with his women and Thomas Crown fooling around with his toys. But it's not as fun or as kinky as that phrasing might make it sound. I think there must be 976 minutes of footage of Thomas Crown zooming around the beach in a dune buggy. Somehow, I doubt those scenes were really that thrilling even in 1968.If you're in the mood for a good heist flick, try The Great Train Robbery, which might be the best of the genre. If you're in the mood for some fun suspense and intrigue, 60s style, try Charade (as someone else here suggested). And if you have some burning desire to watch a guy drive a dune buggy, give Thomas Crown (1968) a try.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The entire method of robbery in this film is lifted intact from the 1952 film "Kansas City Confidential"...? Two completely different films in every other respect, the robbery is exactly the same.I like "The Thomas Crown Affair" very much, Faye Dunaway is particular stunning in this highly entertaining film. As much as I have heard it talked about, I've never heard anyone mention the "borrowed" subplot of the robbery.I suppose this is not unusual to film. The entire second half of "Border Town" (1935) is used again in "They Drive By Night" (1942), and yet each film credits different writers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately, the movie's more about striking hip poses than anything else. McQueen shows what a cool guy he is by endlessly playing with adult toys, while Dunaway gets to model every high fashion on the rack. But neither manages to get beyond the posturing stage. In fact the movie's plot?what there is of it?revolves around cat and mouse between greedy investigator Dunaway and millionaire bank robber McQueen. Yet, crucially, the movie lacks what every cat and mouse theme should have?namely, suspense or even a modicum of tension. Instead, we're treated to over-done romantic interludes, tedious chess game metaphors, and director Jewison's split-screen tricks, none of which immerse the viewer. Pity the poor animated Paul Burke who appears to have wandered onto the wrong set..The best moments are the grabber opening that unfortunately proves misleading, and the subtle close that makes good use of McQueen's practiced deadpan. The in-between unfortunately amounts to little more than empty technique, as does the movie itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Badly dated heist flick, with Steve McQueen miscast as a bored, wealthy businessman looking for a new thrill. He gets it in the form of a bank robbery he engineers with the did of several others. But soon enough hot on his trail, is a flamboyant, female insurance investigator (Dunaway) and an intrepid cop (Burke). The film reeks of its period (the late '60s), which is fun to a point. Besides McQueen's miscasting (watch for his seemingly endless, very fake laughing fit right after the heist) and Dunaway's hammy, unintentionally laughable acting (and the fact that she is garbed in increasingly silly outfits more suited to a circus clown), former TV director Norman Jewison apparently decided to photograph the whole thing in a herky-jerky, mod style. It was 1968, remember. The result is many harsh transitions from one scene to the next, and Jewison often favors long shots when closeups would have done better. As a result, it is virtually impossible to watch this movie today. Better to check out the 1999 remake. There are also many other heist films worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Triumph of Style over Substance- but with style like this, who's complaining?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thomas Crown is a Boston financier who organises a daring bank robbery. This crime is not committed because he needs the money- he has made a large fortune from entirely lawful activities- but because he is bored with life and needs excitement. The police are in the dark as to who might have been responsible, but the bank's insurers are determined to recover their money and appoint Vicki Anderson, a tough female investigator, to look into the affair. Vicki soon comes to suspect Crown, but cannot prove his involvement, and so a game of cat and mouse begins between them. Vicki makes contact with Crown, hoping that he will give himself away, but he is well aware of her suspicions and is too clever to betray himself. They find themselves attracted to one another and eventually begin a love affair, leaving Vicki torn between her feelings for Crown and the job she has been assigned to do (in which she also has a financial interest, as she has been promised a percentage of any money she recovers).The above scenario is, of course, implausible, but this is not a realistic film. It is a glossy colour supplement of a film that one watches not for realism or for its plot but for an atmosphere that has been described as the epitome of sixties cool. The trappings of Crown's millionaire lifestyle are much on display- his expensive cars, his luxuriously furnished penthouse apartment, his Cape Cod beach-house, his private glider, his games of golf and polo. (His surname is significantly derived from a symbol of wealth and power). The two leading actors, both iconic figures of the sixties, are perfectly cast. Steve McQueen was known not only as the Cooler King (his role in "The Great Escape") but also as the King of Cool. He was normally cast in "tough guy" roles, but here he broadens his range by taking on the role of a suave, wealthy playboy (although still with a hint of toughness), the sort of man every man wants to be and every woman wants for herself. Faye Dunaway was perhaps not a classical beauty in the style of some other sixties icons such as Raquel Welch or Julie Christie, but few actresses were better than she at conveying elegant, sophisticated glamour.Everyone who sees this film seems to remember it for the same three things. First, there is director Norman Jewison's use of the "split screen" technique during the robbery and in the scenes of the polo match. This has been criticised as a gimmick, but I found that it did help to give these sequences a greater sense of urgency and rapid movement, a sense also heightened by Michel Legrand's driving musical score. (Legrand also provided a similar score for the British film "The Go-Between"). Second, there is the famous scene, full of sexual symbolism and suggestion but without any overt sexual content, where Vicki seduces Crown- or perhaps it would be more accurate to say they seduce one another- over a game of chess. (Faye Dunaway was at her best here). Third is the well-known theme song "The Windmills of Your Mind". The song's rather enigmatic lyrics do not have any direct reference to the plot of the film, but it fits the general mood perfectly, particularly as the plot itself is often enigmatic.The sixties were the golden age of the heist movie with films such as "Topkapi", "The Biggest Bundle of them All" and "The Italian Job", all of which featured daring robberies carried out by a glamorous cast, often in an exotic setting. This genre has been criticised- and there is justice in the criticism- for glamorising crime and dishonesty, and "The Thomas Crown Affair", although it concentrates as much on the aftermath of the crime as on the robbery itself, falls within this tradition and must therefore bear some of the criticism. It is, however, unlikely that it ever persuaded anyone to take up a career as a millionaire playboy criminal mastermind. It is too obviously a fantasy for that- with its visual tricks, its highly stylised acting (especially from Miss Dunaway) and a general atmosphere that seems unreal, at times even dreamlike, it has about as much to do with real crime as the James Bond films have to do with the everyday work of the British Secret Service. Moreover, unlike some of the other heist movies, such as "The Italian Job" or "The Biggest Bundle", which have artificially moralistic endings, "The Thomas Crown Affair" at least has the courage of its own amorality. Its ending may be ambiguous, but it does not try to drive home a "crime does not pay" message.I prefer this film to the recent Pierce Brosnan remake which, although it has its good points, lacks the distinctive style of the original film. The original has, in fact, been criticised for being a triumph of style over substance. Well yes, it is- but with style like this, who's complaining? 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steve McQueen is surprisingly stiff as millionaire playboy Thomas Crown who plots the perfect bank robbery; Faye Dunaway is the agent who (rather quickly) figures his involvement and pursues him, but who may fall victim to his suave charisma. Dunaway hasn't much of a character to play and so relies on externals (and magazine fashions) to flesh out this unbelievable woman; her motor runs either too fast or too slow, and, while her runway-chic outfits may certainly look attractive, they can't compensate for what is missing in the writing. In fact, the whole picture is presentation, with jazzy split screen visuals spiking the narrative, but you simply cannot build a movie on style alone. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a mystery man assembles a five man team to commit a bank robbery it is going to be difficult to catch him as none of them have seen his face and before the robbery none of them have seen each other. The Mystery man is millionaire Thomas Crown and he didn't mastermind a two million dollar robbery because he needed the cash he did it to see if he could. After the robbers get away there is little to suggest who they were; they were all dressed alike and it is the clothes that the witnesses remember. The police aren't happy to fail but the insurers are even less happy to have to pay out. They call in investigator Vicki Anderson who soon suspects Crown who is one of the five people to know the bank well enough and to have made several trips to Switzerland since the robbery. Of course she has no proof so sets about getting close to him; she tells him that she will get him but he doesn't seem too worried, if anything it just makes life more interesting for him. Eventually it looks as if she has got him but he just says that if he did it once he can do it again? This stylish caper movie is thoroughly amoral; the protagonist is a bank robber who just does it for the thrills, like so many other things he does and the person trying to stop him is quite happy to break the law to catch him? yet it is a lot of fun and the viewer is likely to find himself hoping he will get away with it. Steve McQueen, the epitome of cool, and Faye Dunaway do fine jobs in the lead roles and have a good chemistry; they even manage to make a game of chess erotic! As well as having a good story the film looks great; featuring multiply split scenes and fast cuts that work rather than confusing the viewer.</fullReview>

To escape the routine, Crown prepares a perfect shot: rob a bank with intent to then go to Brazil. To do so meets a group of criminals, and gets to perform the robbery without leaving tracks. A researcher at an insurance company (Dunaway) will investigate the case Steve McQueen plays wonderfully to billionaire "Thomas Crown" in this fabulous film that there is little to blame. It is well adapted to the actress Faye Dunaway paper which gives a touch of sensuality excellent film that makes the viewer to enjoy in many scenes.It's an entertaining movie than to enjoy the perfect couple as Steve McQueen Faye Dunaway with a magnificent setting and achievement. It won one Oscar for Best Song in 1969.The times when the couple shared the screen become very interesting as the romance is treated with great freshness, which allows the viewer to enjoy great entertainment thanks to its sparkling dialogue acids. The scene of the game of chess, is the most sensual you get at the movies. No doubt that this duo became one of the most representative pairs of celluloid.The film also has a very neat soundtrack and with a montage of the most original which mixes different scenes in the moments when a robbery takes place. If we add up all the good work of director Norman Jewison, we have a quality film no doubt where his greatest interest lies in the leading duo, who manages to heat the film thanks to its amazing affinity and witty and sexy dialogue. Moreover, the end is clever and unexpected.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take one playboy millionaire, a gorgeous woman, a bank heist and sprinkle with a fabulous though dated soundtrack and you have the type of film that US movie-makers in the 1960's were experts at producing. I look forward to seeing the re-make, but I know it won't be as good as the original. The directing was slick and the characterisations were brilliant, even though you need only to analyse McQueen and Dunaway. The only thing that marrs the film is the split screen direction at the beginning which probably was state of the art at the time, but appears passe now. As you watch the film you notice that the scenes with Dunaway and the detective are fast-paced and strained, whereas McQueen's scenes are drugged and relaxed, a bossa-nova backing tune never far away. The infamous chess scene is a tongue-in-cheek masterpiece that could never be equalled although the fact that recent films love to parody this suggests that it is rather dated. Although Crown is essentially an immoral character, you have to like him - you want to be him. There are certain similarities with The Great Gatsby in that Crown has so much cash that he is after absolute perfection. Unfortunately he can't get it, but unlike The Great Gatsby, this is by no means a tragic film, much more of a romantic thriller with a twist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of those harmless caper films where the only point is how good-looking the two leads are.But with Faye Dunaway as one of those leads, somehow that's enough. Only a year after her luminous performance in "Bonnie and Clyde," she had already begun to lose that gauzy feminine glamour (or maybe she was just lit extremely well in that film) and acquire that sharper, diamond-jawed and intimidating haughtiness that would make her such a great ball-buster in later films (and which made her kind of scary as well), but she was still knock-out enough to make this film easy enough to sit through. And the ladies get Steve McQueen, not too hard on the eyes himself. I wasn't even born when McQueen was at the peak of his stardom, but I have a feeling that if I had been old enough to care about such things, I would have wanted to BE McQueen, because he got to get it on with actresses like Dunaway and Natalie Wood in his films.Otherwise, this film doesn't have much to make it memorable, except for an erotic chess match(!) and its famous theme song, "The Windmills of Your Mind," that plays over and over and over and over again. They had a budget big enough to pay two superstar salaries but not enough to write a couple of additional songs for the soundtrack? Grade: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They've remade a film you remember fondly. OK, let's go back and take another look at the original. Set the wayback machine for the Tet Offensive and dial up "The Thomas Crown Affair".Did anyone notice how they did the bank robbery? According to legend, the film company installed hidden cameras in a real bank and had cast members interact with customers during normal working hours. The bank's employees were in on the gag, but not these folks you see lining up to cash checks. When they act scared, they really are. If anyone tried that today, they'd buy a lawsuit for invasion of privacy.Steve McQueen is said to be a minimalist actor, standing about looking cool and occasionally mumbling a few sentences of dialogue. In reality, he sold this performance hard, given how different Boston socialite Tommy Crown was from himself. The actor put in a number of 80-hour weeks learning polo, often ending the day with hands bloodied from holding a mallet too long.The young Faye Dunaway, fresh off her "Bonnie and Clyde" breakthrough, matched McQueen for poise and cool, scene after scene. This was crucial to the seduction, as they had to be emotional equals for Crown to place any value on the conquest.Thirty-seven years later and I still haven't found any evidence of windmills in this film, but we'll chalk up the musical score as an elegant period piece, well worth its Oscar. The imitation Expo-67/Emile Radok split screens were a breakthrough at the time and are seldom used to this extent today. Only in hand-held camera movement has this film been significantly copied.Somewhere, Steve McQueen is still smiling that faint Porfirio Rubirosa smile of his.</fullReview>

It might be the worst Steve McQueen movie I've ever seen.To begin with, McQueen should not be playing a wealthy businessman. It doesn't suit him.Secondly, director Norman Jewison's use of split-screen tecniques is overdone by a factor of 10. At times there doesn't even seem to be a point to it.Thirdly, the soundtrack music is loud and intrusive, as if the director wants it to be another character. ("Also staring Michel Legrand as the soundtrack.")One reviewer remarked that the chess scene between McQueen and Dunaway is erotic. Soporific is more like it. If any part of that scene drew my attention it was the design of the chess pieces. As for the interplay between the actors... that's when I shut the movie off and went to bed.The premise of a man who had dangerous hobbies to keep him interested in life is a good one. I've done similar things myself. But it was poorly done in this movie. And Steve McQueen was wrong for that role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thomas Crown (Steve McQueen) is a wealthy man. Wealthy ? yes. Satisfied with life ? no. He needs some excitement in his life. He needs a challenge. Crown concocts a plan to rob a local Boston bank. He hires five men who know nothing of each other to carry out his scheme. Things go just as Crown planned ? Crown has the money, no one was caught, and the police are completely baffled. The perfect crime! But Crown wasn't counting on the ruthless, hard-nosed insurance investigator (Faye Dunaway) sent to find the daring bank robbers. And Crown certainly wasn't expecting the insurance investigator to be so beautiful.The Thomas Crown Affair starts off with a bang. The film opens with an intelligent, well-planned, and cleverly written bank heist. Unfortunately, the bank heist only takes 20 minutes of the film's runtime. The 60s were full of these ingenious crime/caper/heist films and had the remainder of The Thomas Crown Affair lived-up to the promise of the first act, it might have been one of the better examples of the crime/caper/heist film ever made. But things fall apart shortly after Dunaway makes her appearance. She's neither very believable in her role nor do she and McQueen have any on screen chemistry. I will admit that the first meeting between McQueen and Dunaway was interesting, but their cat and mouse game soon gets very tiring. Their scenes together feel forced and unnatural. Many of the reviews on The Thomas Crown Affair highlight "the chess scene" and go so far as to call it "sexy". If by "sexy" they mean too long, too drawn out, and too dull, then I guess it's "sexy".Director Norman Jewison seems intent on using every single ridiculous camera trick at his disposal. Split-screens, gel lenses, and psychedelic colors are only a few examples of what Jewison has up his sleeve. Here's an idea ? just tell your story. The camera tricks do nothing but help to destroy whatever flow and pacing the film might have had. A few of these techniques is okay, too many becomes distracting.Other than the opening 20 minute heist scene, the only other real highlight is the film's final twist as Crown pulls the wool over the eyes of the insurance investigator. It's a nice ending for The Thomas Crown Affair and helps to make up for some of what came before. And fortunately for us, it's a signal that we will no longer be subjected to the terrible on screen pairing of McQueen and Dunaway.</fullReview>

He and a handful of colleagues, all strangers to one another, pull off a major bank heist and make off with more than two million dollars. To recover the money, a beautiful and unorthodox insurance investigator, Faye Dunaway, is brought into the case. They fall in love, or apparently fall in love, and McQueen claims he will give the money back, since he already has all he wants.I realized by the end that some important plot points had escaped me. How come McQueen winds up with ALL the loot? Does Dunaway try to outfox him and send him to jail? And where is McQueen headed in that airliner? Does he leave Dunaway with nothing but a free Mercedes? It was directed by Norman Jewison and released in 1968, a good year for movies generally. It's stylish, yes, but the style is of the period and looks a little odd from our current perspective, like watching a 1942 musical featuring Tommy Dorsey and his band, and a lot of men in uniform jitterbugging with the bobby soxers.It isn't until Dunaway's close ups that you understand the impasto of eye make up in the late 60s. And her black eyelashes are the size of window awnings on an ordinary house. They must flap in a stiff wind. The clothes are tres chic. That's not necessarily bad. Dunaway has nice knees, but otherwise, what with hats the shape of flying saucers, she seems a sterile, odorless presence on the screen. McQueen only looks slightly uncomfortable in his three-piece suits, smoking those thin cigars or demonstrating his recklessness on a golf course.The prolonged scene of their playing chess at McQueens manse has been described as extremely sexy, a kind of foreplay or at least thirdplay, and I can see why. That's clearly what the director was aiming at. But if you're not particularly turned on by either Dunaway's or McQueen, or their characters, it turns into an extended chess match, and that's all.The musical score is of the period too. Very sophisticated in a jazzy and romantic way with Burt Bacharach vocals like ba-ba-dee ba-ba-dumb of the sort that were popular at the time. They are even more pronounced in "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid." The score isn't at all objectionable. I kind of like it. But the faddish split-screens, ripped off from Andy Warhol's "Chelsea Girls" and infecting the screen for the next couple of years, is a distraction and a major nuisance.It's not a terrible movie. Some of the supporting players are quite good and the viewer gets a nice tour of Boston and environs. And it must have been successful because they recently remade it, just as Hollywood now remakes every movie that ever made a nickel. Movies are now based on television sitcoms or adventures, cartoon series, comic books, video games, and earlier successes. If we live long enough we should all witness a remake of Porter's "The Great Train Robbery" from 1903.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seldom do I see a movie I cannot look away from but this movie was an exception. I was taken by the two main characters played by Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway at the top of their form, the original story, on-location filming and the twists and turns up to the end. First of all, Steve McQueen is Mr. Cool pulling off a bank heist that has Boston's police stumped. Then, along comes Faye Dunaway, a mastermind investigator who is hired to help the police chief, played by Paul Burke. McQueen flies off to Switzerland to cover his crimes, thinking he has eluded the police but super sleuth Dunaway hones in on the passenger lists of flights to Switzerland and quickly comes up with the prime suspect. What follows is a love affair and police thriller.Director Norman Jewison put together a great suspense movie and period piece. The split screen is one that I find distracting but was a short-time fad in the 1960's and is used extensively here. The theme Windmills of My Mind is sung beautifully by Noel Harrison, who enjoyed some fame for his catchy tunes. The costume changes are frequent, particularly in the case of Dunaway, and both she and McQueen look classy through the entire movie. The filming is superb. I loved the racing scene in the sand dunes, probably on Cape Cod, and the polo match. The cemetery scenes had added suspense with the tolling of bells at critical moments. For a lot of reasons, I would gladly recommend this riveting mystery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>McQueen's young woman with an accent is the epitome of the gorgeous sexy mini-skirt brunette of the 60s. What is her real name? I think it is Astrid Heerenov but I cannot find a photo to verify it. The moment when she steps out of bed in her under-wear has a type of sexiness that is simple and desirable. Again, her figure is pure female 1960s. Simply a gorgeous woman but apparently did not perform in many more pictures after Crown. Her 60s beauty and the mystery of who she is is infatuating. Similarly, Brosnan had a young woman though she turned out to be effectively a step-daughter. McQueen's squeeze I think appears only twice; once picking up the phone in bed and jumping out to dress, and on that day meeting McQueen in the field as he lands his glider. (remarkable how glider technology improved in that 30 year period). Her shear beauty, sensitive female voice with concern for McQueen just makes you want to fall in love with her. Well, anyways can someone offer some details about her background and life?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best of the "mod" 60's movies ever made. Faye Dunaway looks edible, and how could anyone be cooler than Steve McQueen, in the role that defines "cool" for a generation. This is one of the best endings of any movie I have ever seen, with Faye looking heartbroken, and Steve looking, how else, cool. The acting and split screens showing what each is doing help to drive the plot along to its unlikely ending. McQueen and Dunaway make for some terrific viewing, as they are both at their most physically attractive in this movie. With Dunaway fresh off Bonnie and Clyde and McQueen not far removed from The Sand Pebbles, this movie matches two 60's icons at their best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Steve "cool" McQueen. He was a little before my time but his movies rock. In this movie I like the fact that he was such a mystery even when cornered. While I did like the trendy new one with Pierce Brosnan, McQueen added a more "manly" appeal to his role. Brosnan cuts a more elegant figure. In this version McQueen kept Dunaway at arms length but let her believe she was in control. I think in both versions the women fell really hard for the Millionaire and were similar almost to their endings. The 60s version also had lots of angles for some scenes but the plot had more wordplay, no sex (suggestive) but lots of sexual tension. Older movies have better story lines anyway, they don't rely so much on sex to carry the movie. Love the movie and Steve McQueen (he was a hunk too)! I would recommend it for a Saturday night.</fullReview>

In a category of movies rated just for being fun and pleasant to watch, this could be a 10.I didn't like the title track, but I bought the soundtrack, because the rest of the music is great, and really works with the movie, timing and situation. In terms of mid/late 1960s style, they really put it together without getting bogged down in clichs. Music, wardrobe, scenery is about the top for the 1960s. It really does look cool, because it's the best of what was contemporary when the movie was made.Fay Dunaway was in top form, so was Steve McQueen. Both are usually worth watching in most films. The rest of the acting is good too. Refreshing absence of moralizing - it's entertainment. Some of it seemed implausible, yet there are people like this in our society who have it all, and still risk it all to steal for more than they could ever use, so maybe not so implausible.

		<shortDescription>Cool and Clever and Not Quite Heartless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thomas Crown Affair (1968)Cool and Clever and Not Quite HeartlessA clever, precisely controlled, and cleanly stylized caper drama, with a heavy romantic thread that becomes, eventually, all that matters to both us and the two main characters. Steve McQueen's unflappable, detached businessman who loves his pleasures (from liquor to women to dune buggies) is played perfectly. He's not a sympathetic character at first, but you come to appreciate him, if not love him, and want him to get away with things. Success on his terms is a kind of defiance against the dullness of life, so we can relate. Faye Dunaway, when she comes in, is easily his equal, quick and coy in ways that fit perfectly with his.The plot is carefully delineated, and interesting, but it becomes just background after awhile, as does the police investigation. What matters is how the Dunaway character proceeds, breaking rules and breaking through. She's a great paradigm of a "1960s" woman, liberated and smart but still all female in the usual clichs. I suppose McQueen is a kind of 1960s playboy himself, but he comes off as less fun and less elevated (and more selfish) than, say, Sean Connery's Bond character.There are some stylistic things to enjoy, like the sophisticated "split screens." Starting with the opening credits and continued between scenes throughout is a creative dividing of the screen into several frames, sometimes showing two or three scenes, and with a whole range of different combinations and shapes. It sounds distracting or affected, but it works really well for this kind of cool, clean movie. And the music, up front and a hair heavy handed at times (by Michel Legrand), emphasizes style and chic over realism.Norman Jewison, the director, has had an odd career, stellar at moments, but always emphasizing artifice. "The Russians are Coming" the year before this is a perfect example, also empty but perky. Or the musicals that follow (like "Jesus Christ Superstar"). I think all of these are worth watching if you have the slightest interest in the period, in the way movies had to shift to wider moral scopes as well as to an audience hungry for innovation (and tired of t.v.). But if you really want a look at stylized crime movies from this period at their best, you'd be better off starting with "Klute" or "Point Blank" (the first version). Both are terrific. "Thomas Crown" lacks any one great thread to make it click? the script is routine, the acting reasonable but never sparkling (Dunaway does her best). The filming (Haskell Wexler) and the editing (Hal Ashby, yes!) are standouts in their own ways. It's a period piece, odd to say (being that it's so "mod" in its airy 1960s cool). If all this careful, designerly perfection wears you down, that's understandable. While the plot does unwind about an hour in, we are still made to see and think our way through the plot, and not feel it or inuit it. Which is fine enough. A fitting movie for its time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This brilliant 1968 mystery crime caper is absolutely amazing in its direction, pacing, and storyline. The Thomas Crown Affair is akin to one of the greatest mystery books ever written, brought to life on screen, with surprises and tension around every turn. What happens when a self-absorbing millionaire plans one of the most elaborate crimes ever seen on film? How will the female private investigator respond to this? Can law enforcement effectively track him down and stop him? From the very first notes of the film, the haunting and stunning Windmills of Your Mind soundtrack, which you will remember for the rest of your life, to some of the most elaborate muti-action camera shots that you will ever see, along with the dramatic tension that exists at all times during the movie, The Thomas Crown Affair is one of the most incredible movie experiences that YOUR mind will ever have!You will never forget this movie! The only reason that I cannot give this film a perfect 10 is because this is my first time viewing it, and there are one or two minor loose ends that were not clarified for me. However, this took nothing away from a superb movie! I will not say much more about the movie, because it's too good to give away even the subtle developments. The song ALONE, The Windmills of Your Mind, is worth the price of the film, or time to see the movie all by itself! I have never in my life heard any song that ties so perfectly with the mystery and intrigue of the characters in ANY movie before seeing this one!This is a landmark movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No crowning glory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tricksy, very much child-of-its time 60's caper movie which hasn't aged at all well. Director Jewison, caught up in the moment no doubt, throws everything at us, with numerous, fairly pointless multiple screen shots, dissolve fade-ins, soft focus and over-ornate background music, but the story fails to ever really take off.The movie starts with the mysterious introduction of debonair laconic playboy McQueen coordinating like a chess match a daring bank robbery, which Jewison captures and executes crisply enough but then moves somewhat boringly onto the burgeoning affair between the glamorous insurance bounty-hunter (Faye Dunaway) enlisted to catch him and the conflicts of interests this engenders in both.I'm a fan of McQueen but felt here he overplays (pardon the oxymoron) his laid-back persona - he never really comes alive on the screen and is particularly embarrassing when called on to extemporise laughter. No question, as there never is, as to how sharp he looks throughout and no doubt Steve enjoyed all the jollies that the narrative provided, including a glider-flight, boat run, polo match, beach buggy drive and more, none of which really require him to act.I'm less a fan of Dunaway, a showy mannered actress in my book. Besides looking a good deal less attractive than McQueen's erstwhile girlfriend, who fleetingly appears in the background, she wears a succession of hopelessly dated late 60's flapper-derived fashions all topped off by an increasingly ridiculous hat of some kind. As ever, she over-emotes for America, particularly at the less than gripping denouement (you couldn't call it "climax").The famous (or should that be infamous) love scene with a chess match as foreplay looks comical now, even if it was meant to parody "Tom Jones" banquet scene. No one really shines in the supporting ranks as you're made aware that this is very much a two-star vehicle. Unfortunately, neither main character exhibits any charisma or other redeeming features so that by the end I couldn't care less how their affair was resolved.The theme song's nice though...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chess was never this much fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was interested in seeing this film after I saw the remake, especially when I heard so many people say the original was so much better. After having seen both, I'd call it a toss up (both were good!).Actually, the remake was only loosely based on the original. The original is about a rich guy who knocks off a bank, and the remake about a rich guy who steals art.This film is well crafted and though the story is far fetched (as in the remake) it's entertaining. Norman Jewison does a terrific job of directing. His visual interpretations, camera angles and dramatic effects are timeless. He overuses the split screen concept a bit, but we need to remember that in 1968 this was fairly new technology and he was probably enamoured with the novelty of it. Think of how much `morphing' was being used when it was first developed.Probably the best scene involved the chess match between Thomas (Steve McQueen) and Vicki (Faye Dunaway). It was far more erotic than all the scenes where Rene Russo was running around naked in the remake.The acting was excellent, with Dunaway taking top honors as the stop-at-nothing insurance investigator who literally gets her man. Steve McQueen played the rich macho ego maniac to perfection. His only minus was his phony victory laugh, which was overacted and overused. Paul Burke stayed appropriately but effectively on the sidelines as the police detective.In comparing the two films, I'd have to say it's about even. The remake had a more inventive and interesting story, replacing the bank robbery with an art heist, but it was also more ridiculous in the final disposition of the stolen painting. The original had better direction and use of the camera, while the remake was much better in use of costumes, props and sets in recreating the opulent lifestyle. Clearly the remake benefited from 30 years of technological improvement in sound and film quality.The remake was more self indulgent, especially in the sexual area. The McQueen interpretation of Crown was more realistic than Brosnan's conflicted and emotional distraught version. Each reflected their respective times, but McQueen's character was a better representation of the timeless arrogance of the ultra rich. I have to give Rene Russo a slight edge as the investigator. She gave the character more complexity and range. Paul Burke was far superior to Denis Leary as the cop.The ending of the original was definitely superior, though each ending was really true to the characters' personalities as portrayed.I gave this film an 8/10. If you like classic films, and you enjoyed the remake, you will probably enjoy this one as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched both the 1999 and the 1968 version of this movie back to back. So I warn people I might be a little biased in my review. I enjoyed the plot of the movie. My complaint is that the multiple boxes and rapid editing took what could have been a thrilling piece and made it a muddled mess. I understand this was a popular practice back in the 60's. But I think it worked more to make a mess of the narrative than to enhance it. Faye Dunaway was wonderful in this movie. She sparkles with class, beauty and glamour all through the film. She wants to get the job done and pulls all the stops to get it. Steve McQueen I felt was a little miscast for the role. I know some people will kill me for saying this, I couldn't believe him as the suave Thomas Crown. Maybe it's the plaid suits and my mental image as McQueen as the arch typical 60's tough guy. The thing that surprised me was how this movie took old romantic cliches and made them watchable. Such as the beach and the camp fire, ect. Over all this movie a good 60's period piece, but very uneven for a film that's suppost to be a classic. I enjoyed McQueen in Bullitt from the same year for more.</fullReview>

Films like this are usually disected by university film students to un-layer it's many subtle levels...A fun aspect to this film, to me anyway, has always been its obvious parentage to the Banacek television series. Banacek borrowed heavily from Thomas Crowne. George Peppard, as Banacek, is now a less-bored, educated, wealthy Bostonian. He is now the one working the legal side of the law. His job, recovering heavily insured, stolen items from impossibly executed robberies. He works for the same 10% finders fee Faye Dunaway was after. The "Faye" character is there too. She is still working in the same capacity but as Banacek's rival. There is still the same sexual tension as before, although consumation is watered down for the television audience.So take Thomas Crowne, add an ethnic twist and have him work this side of the law, and for all intents and purposes, Thomas Crowne could be Banacek....The inspiration was definitely there......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original Thomas Crown Affair directed by Norman Jewison was praised in its day as stylish and ahead of its times. On a second view, this is far from the truth. The film is a pretext to show Faye Dunaway in about 30 costume changes and little else of substance.Steve McQueen was a strange bird indeed. As an actor he is always the same. Watch him in this film, or Bullit, or any other of his movies, and you'll see him do the same expressions and pretending to be cool all the time, something that in real life, he was not. Steve McQueen was the product of Hollywood. He was more of a presence than a convincing actor who can make the viewer believe he is seeing that character he is portraying come true.On the other hand, Faye Dunaway went from modeling to acting, and she could act, but not in the way the director instructed her what to do in this film. Faye Dunaway is a beautiful woman who at that point in her career cut quite a figure. Unfortunately, her Vicki Anderson is all phony and mannered.Even the title song is sung badly within the movie. Michel Legrand needed someone else to sing it to do justice to it. Frankly, this film would have died at the box office if it were released today!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am going to compare the two movies in this review, 1968 original (this film) and remake, without spoilers. I watched them back to back for the first time with an open mind.The main similarity is that there a heist, a police investigation and a love connection in both these movies.Other than this, the movies felt quite different, with entirely different locations, activities and even the item being stolen is different. With the 1968 version I felt that the pacing was slower, and the plot was more straightforward (less interesting).The love connection:I don't feel that there was more or less chemistry between the characters in either film, it was more the pacing, where the original has more time spent on the two main characters together, and more emphasis on body language than dialogue. In the original, the characters leave you in less suspense as to what they are doing and why they are doing it. The suspense is in the relationship.The heist:The heist premise is entirely different in both movies. The remake version is clearly superior in every way. In the original it feels like a very small part of the film, like a plot device that just happens rather than a major part of the story. In the remake there is much more detail, and you are left guessing what will happen, it feels more on the edge of your seat.The police investigation:The original police investigation into the heist relies more on the love connection. The remake includes more detailed side plots and investigations that tie well into the main plot, which makes it seem so much more interesting and clever than the original.Conclusion:The plot of the original is fairly simplistic in comparison and not as interesting. If you love dramas you may appreciate the dedication to the characters of the original, but to me it felt like quantity (original) over quality (remake).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thomas Crown Affair (1968): Dir: Norman Jrwison / Cast: Steve McQueen, Faye Dunaway, Paul Burke, Jack Weston, Gordon Pinsent: Clever caper film that gets caught up in romantic formula but not without a heavy dose of wit and charm. Title refers to the anti-hero's lifestyle as well as the romance that threatens to expose him. Thomas Crown pulls off a robbery and Faye Dunaway is sent to investigate but ends up in a romance that will leave her with two choices. Director Norman Jewison does multi-split screen to aid points of view but structure needed more of the crime as oppose to the affair. McQueen plays Crown as witty, laughing at his shrewd accomplishment while baiting Dunaway's seductive methods. What works against the film is its willingness to present the criminal as heroic, even though McQueen is pretty much able to disarm us with his charm. Dunaway is intriguing despite her position within the formula romance. The payoff is her placement in the conclusion and the turmoil going through her mind as he merges far ahead of them. Flat supporting roles from Paul Burke and Jack Weston work against the film. This is also an early appearance for Gordon Pinsent although the film pretty much belongs to the leads. Well made caper that doesn't always work but it maintains a sense of fun. It regards how seduction can reduce even the biggest crimes to exposure. Score: 7 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>McQueen, Dunaway, And A Late 60s Romance Of Crime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What does a late 1960s playboy who has everything do with his time? How about pull off the ultimate robbery?and just for the ever-loving hell of it? That's just what Steve McQueen manages to do as the title character in director Norman Jewison's 1968 crime film THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR. McQueen was one of those actors that is depressingly rare in today's high-glamor, hardcore violent Hollywood: an actor where you only have to look at him to know exactly what he is thinking. He's a rich, successful bank executive who's got so much money and leads such a playboy lifestyle; and yet, he is so bored that, perhaps just for entertainment purposes, he concocts a scheme to rob a bank in Boston, initiated by four associates of his. It seems like the perfect crime. But he hasn't counted on a gorgeous insurance investigator, played by Faye Dunaway, finding her way into his life in an attempt to nail him for this huge heist. And at the same time, Dunaway hasn't counted on her quarry's warped nature either.This is just simply one of those films that takes you back on a time trip of sorts to a time when, after the old Hollywood studio system had collapsed and the way of making films got so radically changed, experimentation in editing, cinematography, and plot were the in things. With respect to THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR, that feeling is enhanced by the inventive direction of Norman Jewison, who had directed McQueen on 1965's THE CINCINNATI KID, and had also done IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT. Jewison, together with legendary cinematographer Haskell Wexler (who had worked with him on IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT), combines inventive editing styles and the use of split-screen, a technique later used by Brian DePalma in several of his films (including SISTERS and CARRIE), McQueen and Dunaway really do strike sparks in ways that not even Pierce Brosnan and Renee Russo could in the 1999 reworking of this movie. Jack Weston (one of the vicious heavies in 1967's WAIT UNTIL DARK), Yaphet Kotto (in an early role), Paul Burke, Gordon Pinsent, and Richard Bull also do good turns here, helped out by the original screenplay of Alan R. Trustman (who shortly thereafter co-wrote the screenplay for McQueen's mega-hit BULLITT).The film also features a lush orchestral score by French composer Michel LeGrand that also includes the Allan and Marilyn Bergman song "The Windmills Of Your Mind" (sung in the film by Noel Harrison, but better remembered in the version by Dusty Springfield that was a hit in the spring of 1969). "Windmills" itself won the 1968 Oscar for Best Song, and rightfully so.By our standards, the crime and sex may seem hopelessly tame, especially in comparison to, say, a Quentin Tarantino bloodbath; but with people like Jewison, McQueen, and Dunaway involved, THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR still ranks as one of the best of its genre type and its era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick 1960s crime drama with the King of Cool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The King of Cool, Steve McQueen, plays a wealthy businessman and thrill seeker who masterminds a bank heist for no other reason than personal gratification. Faye Dunaway plays an investigator who is able to connect him to the crime and falls in love with him over the course of her investigation.It's a slick, high gloss production with A list stars and a big time director in Norm Jewison. It's an engrossing plot with some intriguing police procedure, and it's played well by McQueen and Dunaway. 1960s films always look great to me because of the filming technique used at the time, although you wouldn't necessarily be wrong if you said this one looks pretty dated. Our preoccupation with high technology was starting to show even in 1968. There are numerous scenes of big punchcard computers, electronically controlled typewriters and the like, all cutting edge stuff back then but pretty antique looking now. McQueen cruises around the beach in an orange dune buggy, an iconic 1960's image if there ever was one. While this movie has a pretty familiar crime drama at its core, there are some defects. The only reason McQueen gets implicated in the crime is Dunaway's wild guess that the mastermind shipped the money to Geneva in numbered bank accounts. The police don't have a smidgen of evidence that this actually happened, but he fits that profile, making numerous trips there shortly after the robbery. However, several others fit the profile as well, and she only focuses on McQueen because she finds him personally attractive, and her female instinct tells her that he's the one. As the movie goes on, they really don't get any hard evidence connecting McQueen to the crime. McQueen plays it close to the vest and implicates himself only by his silence and evasiveness on the subject- he never says he did or didn't do it. Only near the end does he tire of the cat and mouse game and tell Dunaway to call in and make a deal with the cops. That's the closest thing to an admission we get. The motivation behind the crime is a little uncertain and a little thin. Thomas Crown is a rich businessman who wouldn't seem to have any incentive to pull off this particular crime. He's a thrill seeker-piloting gliders, playing polo, etc., so we're invited to make the inference that this is just another way for him to get off. There's also a subtle suggestion that after his divorce life is empty, and maybe he doesn't care if he risks everything with this. They do set up Thomas Crown as a rich man who's got some disdain for other rich men, but there's no indication that he's punishing the bank for something, and he's got no problem risking his henchmen or the innocent public to pull off his bank robbery thrill. One man does get shot in the robbery, so although you like his character, you could easily argue that Thomas Crown is not a very sympathetic good guy and maybe actually a bad guy. Good guy or bad, McQueen gets the last laugh as another robbery takes place while he leaves Dunaway high and dry and escapes to rich man's paradise on a private plane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie...but a product of its time, like almost all movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few thoughts...some of the ways that they try to capture the crooks are so unethical that truly all the law enforcement and insurance investigators would be up on criminal charges. What a previous reviewer found sexy in the chess game would probably draw snickers from today's audiences...almost as a parody. Lastly, I guess they still felt that the cops and robbers had to wear hats, when this was really filmed at a time when hats were no longer being worn except by old men. It was out of style by then. I hear that the remake was also quite good but over-sexed. Unfortunately, Hollywood likes to remake good movies more than remaking bad movies and making them better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a pleasing and well acted 60s film that has a bit of sizzle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Faye Dunaway is beautiful and well cast in this film where she plays a seductive, intelligent high-end insurance claim investigator out to find a bank robber, played by Steve McQueen. The chemistry between them seemed sizzling and genuine, and I liked how their relationship develops. I liked the film, had seen the modern version first, and am glad the original could stand up still to the latter one. This one's story was less sophisticated, and as such slightly less likely, and the main flaw for me was the HUGE initial leaps of assumption that Vicky (Dunaway) makes in her investigation given absolutely NO clues as to who the perpetrator of the robbery was. However, from that point, her investigation of Thomas Crown was exciting. The chess scene was excellently done, and must classier than the comparable black and white ball dance scene in the modern version which was a bit cheesy. Sexier too.The trouble with the 1968 version is that it's not aged well, and looks very dated. It is well filmed but has amateurish sound/soundtrack and the split screen boxes don't really add a whole lot for the most part but perhaps they were cutting edge at the time. In a few scenes they do add to the action but only a few. I like that the ending leaves the viewer hanging, whereas in the 1999 version the end is more finished and played through and that does add something, I think. The film is a little improbable but enjoyable to watch and worth the time especially given the lead characters, although they weren't so well developed or rounded but given I'd seen the modern one, I could make comparisons and fill in some of the story. Whereas I prefer the actors in the early film, the latter one is a better film for the most part, and one I've seen a number of times. My advice with this film is to see both of them and enjoy the similarities and differences and this film has a lot to offer in the comparison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Billionaire Robs a Bank</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently a movie was made called the Thomas Crown Affair. Obviously that movie was a remake of this movie. Remakes can be good at times, but in numerous cases the original film can be far superior. As I have not seen the remake, I cannot comment, but according to my sister (which I really don't hold that high when coming to movies), the remake has Rene Russo and Pierce Brosnan walking around naked for most of the time.This movie is focused around a billionaire named Thomas Crown. At the beginning of the movie is stages an excellently executed bank robbery and gets away with it. The people are contacted in rooms where they do not know who they are talking to, and then the rest of the time by phone. Nobody knows who is who, except for Crown, and all are paid from a Swiss Bank Account. The question is why does Crown, with all that money, want to rob a bank? It is easy ? it is the adrenalin rush. Throughout the movie he is doing things, such as gliding, riding a dune buggy, and other such things. He doesn't need the money, and even if he doesn't get the money, he still has more than enough to hold up his end of the bargain.The police are stumped and the insurance agency is reluctant to hand over the money to the bank, so they call in one of their more controversial investigators to find out who did it, and she points out Thomas Crown. What this movie becomes is a psychological war between the investigator and Thomas Crown to force him to speak. She knows, and he knows that she knows, but he is very strong and is able to restrain from saying anything.The chess game they play emphasises the nature of the game that they are playing. She is using all of her sexuality to entrance him and force him to slip, but she has no concrete evidence and he is not revealing anything. Even though her seduction skills are good, and he falls to them, he is strong enough not to say anything.What makes this movie good is the psychological games that Crown and the investigator play. Somebody who doesn't understand the intense psychological battle of wills that occurs in this movie is going to be disappointed and find it boring. It is far from that because of the subtly of what goes on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not what I expected. I expected a movie centered around Steve McQueen pulling off a heist. But actually it's a movie where the (brief) heist occurs early and the rest of the movie is about an insurance investigator played by Faye Dunaway trying to snare McQueen. The leaps of logic that allow Dunaway to get on McQueen's trail strain credulity even more than the implausible heist. The plot leaks like a sieve but the flashy direction and charismatic performances by the leads keeps you interested. McQueen and Dunaway definitely had chemistry. Hard to believe that terrible theme song won an Oscar. It's a good film so give it a shot, especially if you're a fan of "the king of cool" Steve McQueen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thomas Crown Affair (1968)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Go."This is the story of the man who has everything. Except... something.The implementation of the story is somewhat ambiguous, somewhere between a heist movie, a romance and a thriller. It is stylish, it is outrageous at times and it is playful. It is also quite slow. The script is OK, I guess, the actors are good, the music is over the top and the directing is way past the top. The costumes play a big role and so do the sets and the design.This must have been one heck of a movie, back in '68. It has style, it has class, it shows the world of the rich and famous like only a few would have seen it at the time. But in the 50 years since, most of the outrageous things the playboy millionaire does have either become common place or extinct. And since he spends most of the movie doing those things, it may become a bit... boring.The script is a little slow, and in fact I became a little more that restless about half way through, and skipped a lot after that. After all, when somebody beats you over the head with the same idea over and over again, it tends to become irritating.The actors are good, Steve McQueen makes a very convincing playboy, Faye Dunaway is pretty, even though a little... I don't know... square jawed, maybe? Their acting is a bit over the top, but perhaps that's how people did things back then, I wouldn't know. The supporting cast is good, Paul Burke is excellent and Yaphet Kotto appears in one of his early (tiny) roles.The music makes a very powerful first impression, but then it is used once too often. It is loud, too.The direction is interesting, it is ingenious, but it uses gimmicks once too many times until it becomes just... annoying. Director Norman Jewison usually has a message to convey, but I don't know if that is the case here. The sets are great and the outdoors scenes are full of color.The Thomas Crown Affair. An interesting movie, even if a little dated. 7/10?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Thomas Crown Affair" is a movie you'll have a good time watching but at the very same time it most likely won't be one that will stick in your mind.In a way you could say that this movie is being a case of style over substance. Not saying that its substance is that bad but the movie still seems more busy giving the movie an hip, unique style, while the story had far more potential in it than gets eventually exploited. In that regard this movie is also being a bit of disappointment, without calling the movie a bad one.Thing is that the movie has such a fine concept and the perfect actors for it but yet there is far too little happening in the movie. It's the story about a rich thief and playboy, who steals just for the pleasure of it, who is being chased by a young pretty and intelligent insurance investigator. At least that is how the story should have been but instead there are only two heists, in which the main character isn't even really fully participating. And the story could have been a story of a cat and mouse game between the two main characters, constantly out smarting each other but the story never really goes there. Instead it focuses on the romance aspects.But all negativity aside, this remains a good and fun movie to watch. It's a slick movie for normal '60's standards and has a great style to it. It shows once more the versatility of director Norman Jewison, who only just before this movie directed "In the Heat of the Night", which couldn't be a bigger contrast really.It's also really a movie that works due to its cast. Steve McQueen is of course really suitable for a role like this but Faye Dunaway impresses perhaps even more. She plays a strong female character, who yet manages to be still very sensual, which gets best shown during the movie its chess scene, which got spoofed in "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me".All in all the movie still remains one good and fun watch.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Style over Substance' is the point of this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the audio commentary for this film Norman Jewison describe TCA as a film of 'style over substance' and he's right, but the style is the very point of this film. As Norman Jewison points out in the audio commentary from the sound mixing, to camera work, to the editing it was all an experiment in style and the final ingredient in this experiment is the acting. First Faye Dunaway is uber, calm, sexy and collected as she openly admits that she's 'immoral and in it for the money' and is not afraid to use her womanly charms to get what she wants. But for me it's Steve McQueen who sets the tone for this film and in my opinion I find it hard to believe that he found this role challenging because as always he is the epitome of playing it cool.Now I first saw the re-make before I saw the original version and I can't say which I prefer more, there are elements of the re-make that made the idea of the film somewhat stronger but then there are the more quite and subtle moments in the original that were somewhat trampled on by the re-make, for example the love scene. In the original it is a somewhat cheeky, humorous, and a quietly smouldering piece of storytelling, but in the re-make it is nothing more than a full blown, out and out, there no need to imagine it affair. Also another thing that the re-make will not surpass is Steve McQueen as Thomas Crown, now I like Pierce Brosnan, but Steve McQueen is cool without trying to play at being cool and that's the difference. Also the original doesn't go for the Hollywood ending of Tommy and Vicki ending up together. As Norman Jewison says in the audio commentary of the original the fact that Tomas Crown, before he's even done the second robbery, has made up his mind that he'll be on the plane and knows Vicki will betray him is wonderful cynical, he never even gave her the chance.But to give the re-make some credit the fact that it has Thomas Crown take part in the art robbery is a nice touch and adds more to the idea that he's doing it for kicks. Also the re-make makes a bit more effort to give the story more substance, and that's something that the original should have had. If the original Thomas Crown Affair had a bit more substance, and a better development of plot, the caper itself and Tommy's and Vicki love affair then I think the film would have a much higher standing in cinema history. But then again Thomas Crown's life is all about style with no substance, a wealthy man who lives in a big house by himself with no other meaning to his life than to play the part of the rich playboy being seen at the right clubs and wearing what's fashionable. No wonder the man was bored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The story of a rich guy who is so bored that he commits crimes...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I tried to watch "The Thomas Crown Affair", I soon gave up. This is because the director, Norman Jewison, was being innovative and featured many of the scenes in multi-pane. In other words, two, three, four or even more things (sometimes MANY more) are going on at the same time on the screen in small screen shots. It's VERY tough to watch using an old standard television. Fortunately, I got to see this tonight on a very large HD TV--one large enough to take away a lot of my frustration. This is a film best seen this way or in a theater--and I would not see it on anything smaller than 42".When the film begins, you are assaulted with a song that was very popular back in the 1960s ("Windmills of Your Mind" by Noel Harrison). It even won an Oscar--but which is severely dated today. My advice--turn off the sound as the credits roll and play whatever song you like or sing to yourself or take a bathroom break. Just do NOT listen to "Windmills of Your Mind"! When the film begins, you see that Thomas Crown (Steve McQueen) is a hugely successful and very rich man. Yet, inexplicably, he's also a man planning an enormous bank heist. And, as far as the robbery goes, it works like clockwork---and nets 2.6 million dollars! But, with no leads, the police and insurance folks are stumped. So, they call in an expert, Vicki Anderson (Faye Dunaway). She is supposed to be an incredibly brilliant investigator--a match for any crook. Can she manage to nab Thomas Crown? "The Thomas Crown Affair" is unique in a VERY crowded genre. While there have been tons of great caper films, this movie focuses very little on the robbery itself and much more on the plan to capture the crooks. And, this plan includes Vicki vamping Thomas Crown very, very, very slowly (sometimes too slowly). Oddly, she announces that she is going to catch him--something that is quite stylish as well as completely illogical.So how does this film stack up with such great films as "Rififi", "Grand Slam", "Bob Le Flambeur", "Le Deuxieme Souffl", "The Asphalt Jungle", "The Taking of Pelham One, Two, Three" (the original), "The League of Gentlemen", "Kansas City Confidential", "Oceans Eleven" (also the original) and "Odds Against Tomorrow"?! The bottom line is that ALL these films I just mentioned are great films--and by comparison, while "The Thomas Crown Affair" is good, it just doesn't stack up as well. This film is very, very stylish (with lots of costume changes and jet-set locales) but occasionally makes logical jumps. How does Vicki KNOW Thomas Crown committed the crime?! She just KNOWS. The same could go for her finding the driver for the caper--she just KNOWS. Also, while the heist is very well executed, ALL five guys are wearing sunglasses INSIDE a bank and this doesn't draw suspicion?! Fortunately, the film does end well and there is plenty to keep your interest. Not great but well done and very watchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thomas Crown Affair is a very good movie, that I do think is superior to its remake. While its remake is although stylish and slicker perhaps, what it lacked was the clever interplay between the two leads. The film does look a little dated and starts off slowly, but there are some nice locations and costumes especially that exquisite dress Faye Dunnaway wears in the chess scene. Director Norman Jewison directs with precision, and the screenplay has an essence of sophistication. The plot is tense in places, subtle in others. The music is outstanding, and the song Windmills of Your Mind thoroughly deserved the Oscar it won for it is a superb song. The performances are brilliant; Steve McQueen plays Thomas Crown with style and intent and Faye Dunnaway looking as stunning as ever was a revelation as Vicki Anderson. What stood out most of all was the chess scene, one of the most sensual scenes in any movie, and the heist itself was cool. All in all, stylish and underrated. It has its flaws, but it is a definite affair to remember. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elegant, Sexy Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The young and rich Thomas Crown plans the perfect plan: use several partners to rob a bank; the stroke of genius is that he invites each one individually for the job, in the course of several months, so that they only meet for the first time on the actual day of the job. If anything backfires, they can't trace their way back to Crown. But the job doesn't backfire and he finds himself a few millions richer. Of course the bank wants the money back so Vicky Anderson comes and through intuition believes Crown is the mastermind. She just has to prove it. So a sophisticated and sexy cat-and-mouse relationship develops between the two.After finishing watching the movie what struck me most was the coolness of the movie: it seemed Faye Dunaway and Steve McQueen were having a great time playing their characters, never taking themselves two seriously. Some of the fun is that each knows the other knows their true purposes, so they're perfectly casual about their relationship. No one is trying to fool anyone in this movie, just trying to see how far their cleverness will take them.Great cinematography and music complements this elegant thriller: I especially loved the way they divided the screen in several smaller screens during key moments, like the bank heist; watching it from several points simultaneously was amazing. I understand it was very innovative at the time and it's a pity it's not very used anymore: in crime movies I think it still could be well used today. Then we had Michel Legrand's score, cool and witty and suspenseful. "The Windmills of Your Mind" is a lovely song, although I've heard better versions.All in all, The Thomas Crown Affair is an enjoyable thriller with two amazing actors who complemented each other.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps I was spoiled by having seen the remake first. I know that fans of older movies (which I generally consider myself one) will scream when I say that this one is not as good as the remake. Steve McQueen was, well, Steve McQueen and nothing can take away from his charisma and star power. Brosnan does not have this nearly as much. However, this film was full of annoying director tricks, which take the focus away from the story and the characters, and place it on the director. In my opinion if one ever thinks about the director during a film, then he or she has screwed up. The remake's device of an art theft, rather than just cash makes a lot more sense than a rich man bored enough to risk everything for cash that he has no use for. Fay Dunaway was very beautiful, although her make-up was a little jarring. Not her fault, just an odd style that thankfully went out of fashion. This is still a pretty good movie and I recommend seeing it. But it doesn't get a rave from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having just revisited this one for what seems like 10 years (oh wait, it is about ten years), the first thing that chips away at me is the overkilling of gimmicks and a need to be art for arts sake. It's such a shame because the sexual tension of the two leads coupled with a deft story should have made for a 60s masterpiece, but sadly I think Norman Jewison (Director) must have gotten carried away like a kid in a sweet shop with the tools available to him in that burgeoning part of the decade.The use of split screens works at the start but come the end of the film one feels like they have been hit over the head with it to the point of nausea. It also takes a third of the film before Faye Dunaway's Vicky Anderson shows up, which is fine if the film was actually another 30 minutes longer, yet the film isn't any longer and so we get a forced hour of blossoming love and passion and it leaves little room for fleshing out of the characters in relation to the crime heartbeat of the film.There is still much to enjoy here, tho, the story is very impressive and it's one that intrigues all the way to the splendid finale. McQueen &amp; Dunaway sizzle on the screen, none more so than during a chess sequence that had me hot under the collar. Some memorable scenes such as our couple in a sand buggy disturbing flocks of birds, and the scenes in Boston are just delightful, but ultimately the film goes down as style over substance exercise, a big chance wasted, which to a McQueen fan such as myself is infuriating in the extreme. 6.5/10</fullReview>

Itis hard to believe that it is the same actor in the The Runaway. TCA is one of the great movies of cool. With the Jazz soundtrack, one can enjoy this movie. Another enjoyable feature is the way the heists are planned. Why a Ford Station Wagon with wood paneling? In the second heist they use the same car but a different color. Another thing, did anyone notice that in the first Hiest the money bags were in plain sight when he pulled away from the bank. I was concerned that the Policeman on the horse could see the money. I loved the two door Rolls Royce. One can see why there was a strong dune buggy phase in the late 60's Very intelligent indeed. As I reflect, the modern version with Pierce Bronson is much inferior to the original. Again the essence of cool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has a lot going for it but it could have been so much more. It's a heist film with Steve McQueen as a wealthy crook, which turns into a game of cat and mouse between Faye Dunaway as an insurance investigator. Dunaway is way too beautiful to be a convincing insurance investigator but she was one of the few leading women, like Jacqueline Bisset, who could play the female lead to McQueen.McQueen's charisma largely offsets the film's faults. Though not a great actor, he was competent and he was a bona-fide movie star, up there in 60's Cool Heaven along with Paul Newman and James Dean.The film uses multiple screen images which was an interesting experiment of the times. The remake of the Italian Job (2003) owes a lot stylistically to The Thomas Crown Affair.It suffers from one of the worst ever songs, Windmills of the Mind, which is so bad it's embarrassing to listen to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard Thomas Crown affair (1999) with Pierce Brosnan was a remake i was curious how the original would be! First of all the remake is very different from the original! So it is not fair to compare them to each other! I do understand that the main psychological game play between Faye Dunaway and Steve Mqueen is the same as between Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo! But I do think this movie is dated! The pace was too slow and not much is happening! The performances of Steve Mqueen and Faye Dunaway are adequate! I don't know if it was intentional but I didn't really like the characters and therefore didn't care for them! When Steve successfully pulls the first heist and celebrates on his own in his study I got some creepy feelings! The way he laughs was a bit disturbing! The second time he laughs like this I was convinced that Thomas Crown has some mental problems! At least Pierce Brosnan in the remake was a very likable character! I must admit there is some chemistry between Steve and Faye and works for the movie! The ending and the betrayal that is a consequence of this relationship for that time must have been shocking! Now it is just nice! I expected much more! Steve Mqueen never let me down in other movies but somehow he seems out of place in this one! This movie is not for me!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A classic "swinging 60's" movie. In fact this is the way in late 1960's cool movies were meant.Compared with today's picture this one may look a little slow, but if you go back into the mood of those years, well the result is magnificent.Thomas Crown is the man every man would like to be and Vicky is the girl every man would kill for.Faye Dunaway's beauty could be the only thing this movie should be seen, but the 60's air you breath along is worth too.Watch it. If you don't fall in love with Vicky in the Chess scene, well, you're not a masculine human being. If you don't fall in love with Tommy at first sight, well, your femme heart is made of steel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>McQueen's favorite movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw this movie again for the first time in awhile. As a long-time fan of McQueen, I liked him in this role because it was different for him. It was said to be his favorite movie because he had to fight for the role, as Norman Jewison, the director, wanted to cast a stereotypically suave actor like Sean Connery in the role.Some comments here say he is miscast, or mumbles too much, or is too arrogant, or all of the other standard knocks against McQueen. That's missing the point - casting McQueen as far away from type as possible is one of the gimmicks of the film. Would Laurence Olivier or Richard Burton, great "actors" - i.e. overactors, been right for that role? Of course not. Nor would Connery, with his growling Irish accent.I'm sticking up for McQueen here, as he brought the role off with a certain jumpiness that made the character more interesting. Crown is also more approachable than most McQueen characters. In contrast, Pierce Brosnan, the star of the remake, is OK but not nearly as compelling as McQueen.The rest of the cast is good. Faye Dunaway's character is there for mostly decorative purposes but she fulfills that need perfectly. Jack Weston, a great character actor, is excellent in his role also, playing it very believably. The police lieutenant, played by Paul Burke, was made far too unlikable, placing the viewers sympathies squarely with Crown - but that is not Burke's fault, he is more than competent.The early scenes are the best, especially the robbery. The romantic parts of the film are good at first but begin meandering, too much time is spent on that. The music score, as commented on previously, is too intrusive. And the split-screen techniques became a distraction.But comparing it to a movie made today is pointless. After all, the movie was made in 1967-1968. I'll take some of the dated aspects of this movie over the endless explosions, special effects, and wanna-be movie stars of today's films anytime. And the previous comment by someone that Looney Clooney and J. Lo were better in a recent film than McQueen and Dunaway were in the Thomas Crown Affair gave me the biggest laugh I've had for some time.While no masterpiece, this movie is entertaining enough. I'd give it a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

In Boston's upper-crust, Beacon Hill Brahmin cultural setting, you can see how both McQueen and Dunaway had characters nailed, while Brosnan and Russo were so sleek, they looked more like, well, Brosnan and Russo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very 1960s affair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jet-setting, modernistic, romantic thriller in which Faye Dunnaway's sexy sleuth plays cat and mouse (and chess!) with Steve McQueen's playboy thief. The editing is really quite advanced for 1968, but the film shows its age in lots of little ways: the garish soundtrack, the clumsy split-screen gimmick, McQueen's smoking and a scene where a minor female character shows us some gratuitous nudity but wearing knickers! - when was the last time you saw that in a film? The film paints a less indulgent view of its characters than Soderbergh's lamentable "Out of Sight", but basically we're on the same ground, and there's little substance, or speed, behind the glamourous front. All that remains in the windmills of your mind is that twee, beguiling title song.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this film good, but I think the first thing that annoy me is the montage on the screen. There were a lot of small shots together on the screen and that made it a little bit obscure / confused. The story was also weak in every way the end. But there are also good points in the film like always in a movie.* The acting of Faye Dunaway was good, but she was just at the beginning of her career but let see she really can do it on the screen (but her work in mommie dearest as joan crawford or chinatown is even better). Her role was to small when she appeared a little bit more it would be better. * Also Steven McQueen tried to make a good film and his acting is very good and worth watching.So when you love McQueen or Dunaway it is a film worth seeing, but when you will have a great classic like Chinatown,... you will be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thomas Crown Affair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew I had seen the Pierce Brosnan remake, so I was interested to see what the original film was going to be like, from director Norman Jewison (In the Heat of the Night, Moonstruck). Basically four men pull off a daytime robbery at a bank, dumping the money in a trash can, and going their separate ways. This money is picked up by wealthy successful businessman Thomas Crown (Steve McQueen), and it is the job of independent insurance investigator Vicki Anderson (Faye Dunaway) to recover the money. She is asking everyone who knows enough about the bank, and discovers Crown, keeping a tight on every move he makes, to the point where they start seeing each other socially. Their attraction becomes pretty strong to the point where when Crown plans another robbery, Vicki is unsure of what actions she will take, luckily, he gets away before the cops get get to him. Also starring Paul Burke as Lt. Eddy Malone, Jack Weston as Erwin, Biff McGuire as Sandy, Yaphet Kotto as Carl, Todd Martin as Benjy, Sam Melville as Dave Addison Powell as Abe and Sidney Armus as Arnie. One of the most iconic scenes of the film, spoofed brilliantly in Austin Powers, is the chess playing scene with Dunaway rubbing her pieces, this scene was number 71 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. As for the full film, McQueen and Dunaway make the most of their time on screen, it's not a bad romantic crime caper. It won the Oscar for Best Song for "The Windmills of Your Mind" (it also won the Golden Globe, and it was number 57 on 100 Years, 100 Songs), and it was nominated for Best Music, it was nominated the BAFTA for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Steve McQueen was number 14 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 49 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 43 on The World's Greatest Actor. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful But Shallow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching "The Thomas Crown Affair" is an experience in stylish '60s chic. Does it hold up, with the presence of Steve McQueen, Faye Dunaway, Jack Weston, and Norman Jewison? Man, I wish it did! Well, it sort of holds up. The first 30 minutes does, anyway, with a bank robbery sequence featuring Weston, McQueen, Yaphet Kotto, and three D. B. Cooper lookalikes. Actually, this is where director Jewison makes his strongest push for a solid crime thriller, in the opening 30 minutes, before Dunaway shows up. After that, through no fault of hers, its all downhill.McQueen is Thomas Crown, a Boston brahmin businessman in a three-piece suit and comfortable living quarters with a predilication for taking advantage of others. "You overpaid" is the way he breaks it to a group of businessmen he makes a deal with at the picture's outset, and that's his style through the rest of the film, whether it's telling bank-robbery associate Jack Weston why he shouldn't wonder about things ("No questions. What you don't know can't hurt you. You or me, Erwin boy") or investigator Faye Dunaway why she should just forego her job of sleuthing out the truth and hang with him in Europe for an extended vacation.I'm a big Steve McQueen fan, but this time around I cared more about what happened to Jack Weston's character. This factored into why I liked "The Thomas Crown Affair" less than I wanted to. Steve McQueen is great when he's a badass, except when he's making too much of that fact. "Thomas Crown" makes too much of that fact.Is it immoral to like a film that celebrates how the well-off take advantage of the less so? Well, I say so. Crown, an already rich guy who wants more, is certainly a questionable hero. So's Dunaway's Miss Vicki, an insurance investigator who maybe falls in love with Crown while trying to figure out whether he's the mastermind behind the big Boston bank robbery with which the film opens. After a while, I was hoping the pair would catch VD. Was I at fault, or them?Oh, and I really don't like the title song, performed by Rex Harrison's son Nigel without the benefit of Daddy explaining where the virtues of "talk-singing" ended. "A circle in a spiral/A wheel within a wheel/Never ending, never beginning, in an ever spinning reel/As the images unwind/Like the circles that you find/In the windmills of your mind". Did that really pass for profound in the '60s somehow? The basis of "Thomas Crown Affair" is that crime pays, at least it did the 1960s, with Jewison directing and Haskell Wexler doing the cinematography. Watching McQueen and Dunaway riding a dune buggy on Cape Cod is to feel intimately connected with the 1960s, in a way no other Dunaway nor McQueen film does. That's not only what's good but what's great about this film.But crime DOES pay, watching this film. Crown is a rascal, but not unlikably so. His relationship with Miss Vicki doesn't suffer from too much hand-holding, just cooking lobsters in the sand and taking the proper measure of one another. I wished McQueen's interest in bank robbery was more in line with the involuntary kind practiced in "The Getaway", but he's not a total bounder, and there's a strong enough suggestion of his taking a different path with Miss Vicki so as not to totally turn you against the zeitgeist of this film.It's just that I wish the film had more going for it than a caper romance. However solidly '60s, it would have been nicer if "The Thomas Crown Affair" made it somehow more enjoyable to enjoy its sumptuous cinematography, its images of Boston in midsummer, its hang-gliding with gorgeous ladies in skimpy underwear."The Thomas Crown Affair" is a fun film, and one of the most beautiful McQueen ever made. But whatever its surface virtues, it makes for only a somewhat satisfying movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steve McQueen Before the Fall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though the 'fractured screen' is used as a matter of course these days, the director was in love with his special effects and bombards the audience with multi-screen images of polo playing, Boston and crooks converging on the crime scene. The kiss is reminescent of Hitchock's 'Vertigo'. You will love the ending with its' quaint old-fashioned message of "Crime Don't Pay".Reading Steve McQueen's biography concurrently with viewing this film, I thought of his John Wayne-style of acting. In other words, he always played himself. Thomas Crown aka Steve McQueen is amoral, tough and a lady-killer.The acting was in the elite manners, the to-the-manor-born attitude of Crown as he moves easily among the auction attendees, the polo players. Since the corporate executive suite is akin to any Bronx street gang meeting that could be imagined, despite the veneer, there is no acting challenge there.The attitude displayed toward the Swiss 'nonchalance toward airline baggage' and the cash it may contain really resonates with today's revelations of the Swiss complicity in the Nazi thievery. How many gold fillings also made it into those Swiss banks, you wonder.The love scenes were quite impressive and had some real chemistry. (Can't wait to read Faye Dunaway's autobiography now.) Naturally, I loved the Boston scenes but hated it when the skyline was miniaturized to fit with all the other scenes compressed into one. Cape Cod was never so lovely, and one thinks of how far we've come with our environmental consciousness, as McQueen careens all over the dunes and their precious sand-holding grass with his dune buggy.The plot is practically non-existent, and Dunaway's guessing of every part of his plan takes you out of the logical...another case of suspension of disbelief required. Just sit back and enjoy the scenery, and the sexual chemistry--which is much more erotic than the 'beast with two backs' you usually see today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Style over story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film begins with a split-screen title sequence that features the catchy 'Windmills of Your Mind'. We then move fairly swiftly into a bank heist, that is both thrilling and inventive...but unfortunately, the film never betters this opening twenty minutes. After those have elapsed, the film moves into a dull, sixties-set, pseudo romance/character study that is neither thrilling nor inventive. It's a massive shame that this film isn't great as it could have been a lovingly crafted tribute to the decade where it was socially acceptable to wear garish clothes and listen to hippy music, but instead it's just another Steve McQueen vehicle. The man himself plays Thomas Crown; a millionaire bank robber that does bank heists for the fun of it. He is joined by Faye Dunaway, who is the police detective sent to investigate Thomas Crown. What then follows is the most boring game of cat and mouse ever filmed...The film falls down on the story side mainly because it's two leads have no chemistry together. Their romance comes off as forced, and some of their scenes together are excruciating for the viewer. Take the chess scene for example; supposedly 'one of the sexiest scenes ever film', is actually incredibly boring. It's massively overlong, and this isn't helped by the fact that the two don't bode well together on screen at all. Individually, this isn't a good day at the office for either star. Steve McQueen has proved himself as a suave screen persona in many films, and you would think that this role would fit him like a glove; but his performance is too understated and he looks bored. I've never rated Faye Dunaway anyway, and this film doesn't do anything to change that. The film seems all too keen to pile on the style as well, and with numerous split screen sequences, that are cool at first but quickly become annoying, this isn't a good thing as it comes at the expense of the story. As mentioned earlier, this could have been an interesting portrait of the sixties, but it fails. See Charade if you want to see something like what this film could have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've Never Played Chess Like That</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And I've never liked Faye Dunaway. But The Thomas Crown Affair is an credibility-challenged bit of heist fluff that captures the wealthy cool zeitgeist of 1967. The best single part of TTCA is Steve McQueen, arguably the King of Cool in this time period. His Thomas Crown, wealthy beyond comprehension, finds amusement in planning the robbing of banks. He's an utterly charming sociopath who enjoys the challenge of slapping morality in the face without his hand being seen.His adversary is Faye Dunaway, an insurance investigator whose character seems to have been written not as a recognizable human being but as a fabricated love-interest/huntress in some of the weirdest designer gowns this side of Star Trek. We simply cannot believe her, but McQueen has some depth.So what do we do with a movie that is almost totally dependent on style instead of substance? We double-down on the style! The dune buggy, the glider, the lean-and-mean cool of McQueen juxtaposed in an ultra-square three-piece suit (with watch chain) all help to paint a cultural picture of the six-and-up figure income set in the Age of Aquarius.And then there's that chess game.I don't know what to think about Norman Jewison's The Thomas Crown Affair. It's fun to watch, but so is the occasional 60s sitcom. It's as tailored as McQueen's suits, but the movie and the suits have nothing much in them.My grandmother used to refer to her favorite pastries as "air." That's what TTCA is, a fluffy nothing filled with calories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thomas Crown: Checkmate!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original is always the best, and so it is with The Thomas Crown Affair starring Mr. Kuul- Hot, Steve McQueen and Ms. Diva Hottie, Faye Dunaway. Lean, rich, and verbally sparing throughout the film, the two leads are the epitome of what the idea of hot sex was about in the aftermath of the hippie movement, women's lib, and with the changing dynamic between men as macho and women as passive hausfrau. Stylishly elegant in fabulous designer dresses of the era, Faye Dunaway is all eyeshadow, eyelashes, and one smart blonde. McQueen in his first role as a suit wearing swinger is so confident he oozes testosterone and has never looked better doing it. Women wanted seduction and men wanted his car toys and his women, but Steve is always just one step out of reach.The Thomas Crown Affair is the kind of late 60s suspense caper that was geared toward a younger crowd who did not find the Rat Pack interesting, but with McQueen as Crown, there was the hook. Thomas Crown, a rich, bored, and enormously public investment banker sets up the perfect crime -- rob a bank of $2.6 million and do it through a series of anonymous encounters with crooks at his direction. Brilliant and taut, this is white collar crime before computers and reality TV. The police led by a hard-nose detective Paul Burke, is outwitted by Ms. Dunaway's smooth, sexual Vickie, a woman who uses her body as well as her brain to get to Crown and figure out his scheme. As Crown wines and dines Vickie, an erotic game of chess is symbolic of the ongoing crime investigation to pin Thomas. Vickie plays for the money but is loosing her heart. In the end, Crown offers to replace the money and the trap is set with Vickie holding a note that offers to change her life, if she'll continue to play along.One of the best cat and mouse films since Cary Grant and Grace Kelly in To Catch A Thief, the 1968 version of The Thomas Crown Affair is ultimately the standard which the remake tried to match. Photography by Haskell Wexler is cutting edge, multi-screen images, and with a sound trak of the wistful "Windmill of Your Mind," this is the film that introduces adult sexuality as theme entertainment with a flare for the notion of contemporary celebrity-heavy personality. The public's love affair with Dunaway after her Bonnie and Clyde performance was in full swing, and the aura of McQueen is legend. A film library keeper and great evening event for a side-by-side comparison with the remake, but compared to McQueen -- Pierce Brosnan who?</fullReview>

On the one hand, it's a good story about embezzlement; on the other hand, it seems like they go a little too far in focusing on visuals, and that sort of dominates the movie. Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway certainly do a good job with their roles, he as the Machiavellian businessman and she as the tricky woman investigating him. As for the sexy chess game and the minute-long kiss, you have to see them to believe them.But like I said, the movie seems like it gets very obsessed with visuals - particularly clothes - and so can't even pretend to be any kind of masterpiece. I wondered why they remade it; this doesn't seem to be the sort of movie that they should have remade. But if we interpret "TTCA" strictly as a story of embezzlement, it's worth seeing.

Faye Dunaway could surely act and, as a drop-dead gorgeous clothes horse with an inexplicable eye for evil seeds, she is fun to watch.There were a lot of wonderful art pictures coming out of Hollywood in the 1960s. This isn't one of them. The script and dialogue are dull and unimaginative. The music, in a style which has become all too prevalent in recent years, covers the drama rather than complementing it. The props all resemble product placements for a picture Sean Connery might have turned down.But for nostalgia's sake, if the color on the print you see hasn't faded too much, you can't beat all the shots of the Charles River in the springtime long ago and Faye Dunaway in a pink straw fedora hat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it's so interesting to watch old films of the 70's and earlier, because they are so different from movies of today. I thought the film was a bit slow, but not unbearably slow. The story was kind of interesting, but nothing spectacular.I saw the John McTiernan remake of this film first and have been wanting to see the original for some time now. I think I liked the John McTiernan film a little better. I feel that the story was told better. In this version (Norman Jewison version), I thought the end of the film wasn't told very well, I am still a little confused as to what exactly happened?I didn't particularly like how at some points throughout the film there would be two or three things going on at the same time and each would be shown in little boxes. Hopefully if you've seen the film you'll know what I'm talking about. It's kind of hard to explain.I thought the actors did a fine job in the film. I think this is the first film I've seen with Steve McQueen. He did a fine job (although I wasn't terribly fond of his laugh). Faye Dunaway looked great in the film! As for the rest of the cast, I've never heard of any of them, they did a fine job though.One little piece of movie trivia that I noticed is that this film was directed by Norman Jewison, as was the original "Rollerball" (1975). The remake of "The Thomas Crown Affair" (1999) and the remake of "Rollerball" (2002) was directed by John McTiernan. Kind of interesting huh?Overall, I thought it was an OK film.

		<shortDescription>What a movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1968 caper/romantic drama paired 2 of the 1960s biggest screen icons: Oscar-nominee Steve McQueen and Oscar-winner Faye Dunaway. The chemistry between them is sensational, as is the split-screen visual effects. My favorite scene is the sensual chess scene. This movie is quite psychedelic in its own way, which film buffs will appreciate. McQueen and Dunaway teamed once again, in 1974's The Towering Inferno, although it was a shame that their characters didn't have as much interaction as they do in this film. This is easily a five-star cinematic masterpiece (and check out Dunaway's very chic apparel!). Oscar-winner for Best Song.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The chess match.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The romantic, sexual and dramatic tension of this movie are all consummated, explicated, kinematically explained in the chess match. In my humble and amateurish opinion, that scene is one of the most provocative and invigorating in film, particularly in the action genre. The pairing of music with movement and mise en scene as well as incorporating subtle corporeal responses finds a new and heightened awareness in Jewison's tour de force execution of human biorhythms and intrigue. In other words, it is a masterful, seductive sequence that is an allegorical expression of the movie itself.See it! The filming and editing are superb and the actors are as sexy as they come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's easy to be hard on 60's films that carry an over-the-top flair that we scorn today. Yet, for all its indulgent tendencies (including a subtle-as-a-sledgehammer soundtrack from Michel Legrand), there are lots of fine moments in this movie. I like Jack Weston's portrayal as the station wagon-driving salesman, Faye Dunaway's eyes (cosmetic wonders), Steve McQueen's insane laugh and the surprise finale. Director Norman Jewison leaves you empty when it's all over but you had fun getting there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect example of how a good movie can age badly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any movie buff knows that later moviemakers borrow scenes, characters or entire plots from earlier great works. Many people can recognize short parts of new movies that are identical to parts from other movies. This practice is so commonplace that in some cases you can see a "classic" movie for the first time and feel that you have seen something similar many times before.?@ Add to this the fact that older movies tend to be slower paced than the newer films, and that they have unimpressive visual effects by today's standards, and you are likely to get disappointment from younger viewers. This movie *was* great. Unfortunately, you would have to exercise your imagination to understand just how great this film once was. Today, let?fs just call it entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood Is Thomas Crown ! (With Only One Difference !)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was 1968. The French movies marked its own mark, the TV became such a tough competitor, the big production companies in Hollywood got merged (Warner Bros &amp; The television company Seven Arts in 1967) or vended (Paramount Pictures to Gulf &amp; Western in 1966), (United Artists to Transqmerica Corp in 1967), 80 % of the majors studios make their movies out of the studios' walls, a new image for the ancient genres has appeared (Man &amp; Woman - 1966), (The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly - 1966), (Bonnie and Clyde - 1967), (Bullitt - 1968), and it was the year of experiment like (2001 A Space Odyssey - 1968), and one year before others (The Easy Rider - 1969), (Midnight Cowboy - 1969) ! Strange days aren't they ?! But whatever the result was, it must be so interesting. Since they wanted back then to make a commercial movie to amuse while there were new corporations to produce, new forms to entertain, and new taste to satisfy. Yet it's the same old rule in the book. The rule which is forever. It's How to make money ?An attractive millionaire + a beautiful woman + a catchy heist + a game of seduction + stylish sets + exquisite backgrounds + sightly cinematography + nice music + romantic mysterious atmosphere = this movie as the new method of making the American commercial ones at the late 1960s but unfortunately with no meaning except to entertain ONLY ! It's the sweetest richest ice cream at the time ! Maybe there were some issues simmering at 1968 but they were always there (and always are !) and this is the perfect way to forget about them, to ease up on your brain a little ! The noticeable thing (and lamentable as well !) is that the same kind of this movies right now became more trite and less sophisticated. Just compare between (The Thomas Crown Affair) the original and the remake 31 years later to grasp it easily !As for me I didn't like all the cold script, the big holes, that 102 min vacation at the Crown's (or at the Hollywood's dreams factor !). I'm not that rich, careless, sly Tommy. Though that could make me the perfect viewer of it as a compensation of all what I miss, however it was all what I miss and not wanting to have also ! Actually the matter of the tranquil millionaire who has more than he wants and goes to stole more &amp; more cleverly is something quite unbearable for me. I love the poor criminal, the miserable crook, but that type of existential rich brat who has his own mysterious battle with the system (what system ?!) is all repellent despite the whole colorful brightness, precise adornment, magically anesthetic ! Because it was so flat, hallow and so frigid. We didn't even know about that real appealing character (for women and for the drama also) who is too desolate (no friends, no real love), too repressed (so his rare laugh was explosive to a creepy extent), too inhuman (his phrases' rhythm belonged sometimes to a talking robot), and too lost (has everything yet does crimes just for the fun of it !). Who is Thomas Crown ? A question this movie didn't answer and didn't ask either ! And I think it's not enough to analyze a personality by a song, even by playing it twice. Still (Windmills of Your Mind) stands alone, having the same problem of its movie; beautiful, but with no depth, running confusingly like a windmill IN your mind, missing any powerful drama to translate or revive it! It's only the last scene that gave us a little clue; Thomas Crown is smarter and "higher" than all the rest, having the biggest kick out of beating everybody's intelligence, and he doesn't really love anyone or anything but feeling that, being the ultimate deceiver; which's even more enjoyable than winning the money, any money. Hence, unlike many things in the movie, the title could be that meaningful, owning a nice pun; whereas the "affair" here isn't the love story or a love story at all, it is eventually pure business or rather a wholly professional matter, standing strictly for Thomas Crown's "job" to do and to pull. But anyway, this movie fell in love with Crown's wealth and colors. So it pushes us to slide into the silly world of people we wouldn't meet, or to have the longest tripe into so many postal carts which were pretty and tasty but inanimate !At the end.. There is no end ! Because Hollywood is Thomas Crown; whereas both are rich, famous and attractive, both can plan the almost perfect crime (for stealing money or attention !), both had a charming world which we simply adore &amp; sink into permanently, and both can delude us brightly and get away with it ! BUT there is one big important difference between the 2; as unlike him sees that "money is not funny"?Hollywood sees, always and forever, that money is very very very funny !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish but vacuous heist flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not surprised that Pierce Brosnan was chosen for the lead in the 90s remake of this film - it has an awful lot in common with the 007 series in which Brosnan made his name. Ian Fleming's Bond stories were written for post-war, depressed Britain, and aimed at an appeal based on materialistic extravagance as well as thrills. Like Bond, Thomas Crown seems to have stepped straight from the pages of GQ magazine: he wears the finest clothes, drinks the best brandy, eats at the best restaurants, plays golf at the most exclusive clubs, and relaxes by flying planes or playing polo. Of course, he also attracts the most beautiful female police detective to hunt him down after he organises the perfect crime as a kind of hobby alongside his million-dollar financial trading company.With the plot lacking real excitement and the film noticeably humourless, everything hinges on the relationship between Crown (Steve McQueen) and his pursuer (Faye Dunaway). They are actors with great charisma but pretty one-dimensional in this film, and it has to be said they compare badly with the performances of George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez in similar roles in the more recent Out of Sight.The outstanding features of this film are the slick direction (very flashy for the 1960s) and the soundtrack, made famous by the song 'Windmills of your Mind'.</fullReview>

The story itself is brilliant, and the (sexual) tension others will report as being present is certainly there, but this movie is dated, so dated. It's made to look good at a particular time in history, and those who made it lost sight of what they should have not forgot, namely that it's a question of just making a good movie that looks good anytime, anywhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steve McQueen and Norman Jewison</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following on from the success of 'In the Heat of the Night' with Sidney Poitier, Norman Jewison went on to direct Steve McQueen in this rather inferior version of 'The Thomas Crown Affair'. The remake of the film in 1999 with Pierce Brosnan had a better score, better ending and far more engaging situations than the original. Its strength is probably down to the fact that Norman Jewison got to work with McQueen on the back of 'In the Heat of the Night' rather than it being a significant McQueen film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's an interesting picture."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fairly routine crime thriller that is almost consumed by its own overcooked trickery.The first third of Thomas Crown is the weakest, where the split screen innovation at one point sees the picture divide into 54 separate images. Things calm down and pick up for the middle third, where Faye Dunaway tracks McQueen in her role as a criminal investigator. She knows he's guilty, he admits it to her, but proving it is what fuels the rest of the movie.Most famously, there's the chess seduction, or "how many masturbation analogies can you get out of chess pieces?" scene. This brings up another problem, perhaps not relevant at the time: the incidental music. Said chess game is played out with inappropriate quizzical jazz, which works against the images. Also notable is the (Oscar-winning) title track, "Windmills of your Mind", which is all very nice, but what is it to do with the film?Of course, it would help matters if there were a genuine spark between the two leads, and maybe a more fully developed role for Paul Burke. But as it is the film's thin premise is played out to its somewhat predictable conclusion. For a classic Norman Jewison film, see In The Heat of the Night. Surprisingly, the '99 remake, despite being more mainstream and less iconographic, was actually someway the better film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic guilty fun, and cunning political artifice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am in complete agreement with 'Jake (filmphilosopher)' on this site.I find O'Donoghue well-informed and interesting; and though I don't agree with her critique of 'The Thomas Crown Affair,' I find her characterization of McQueen's role, and of the film he dominates, in terms of the 'egotistical fraud' (as she calls it) typically perpetrated in the superficial oeuvre of the minor Nouvelle Vague director Claud Lelouch, to be spot-on: Precisely so - I want to say - : For 'form follows function'.In short, the portrayal of two brilliantly brittle power-poseurs produces - at one level - a superbly crafted firework display of dishonestly loaded, narcissistic, cynical late-sixties 'hip.' Classic guilty fun?Instead of the alienated, intellectual popular 'cool' of gallic gangsterism, where human eccentricity keeps subverting ruthlessness, Jewison hijacks the alienating frigidity and control-freakery of high-capitalistic wheeler-dealing to craft the most wickedly icy spectacle of mutual greed, that at once drives - as it drives apart - the two nominally 'romantic', but actually extremely circumspect, leads - who indeed remain wary of each other to the point of hostility.This is precisely a 1968 film, not merely a broadly generic '60's film': It was a year of revolution. It contains as much subversion of Hollywoodized Americanism as a Godard film. There is the same contemptuous mastery of a capitalist industrial art-form, in TCA, that only the more ruthlessly exposes the emptiness and redundancy at the heart of modern, Americanized, culture.So the whole pleasure to be had from this film is stylistic: The a-moral Melvillian suppression of affect reposes the entire burden of responsibility in the sheer technique. This is an alienist's, a Sartrean, ploy. We are seduced into sharing the guilt-free criminal joys of cynical power-brokers. It is this which prompts in us, after fascination, the revulsion which can motivate revolutionary consciousness.The very exercise of wealth-as-power drives out all other significance. The sheer process of the film - such as the bravura split-screen flourishes - are perfectly engineered to demonstrate the existential emptiness, the pure superficiality, of such quintessentially capitalistic world-mastery.Thomas Crown, implied 'King of Crime,' is fatally compromised as a human character by his inability to connect: Flying high at the end of the film - in the pyrotechnic yet ephemeral arc of his split-screen vapour-trail - he is in reality reduced to a cloudy fiction, an irresponsible and evanescent god .He does not even believe in himself. His hollow, cynical laughter had earlier exposed his realisation of a total ennui with the things of earth, a bankrupt materialism.And yet there is in this very emptiness - the anonymous expanse of an empty heaven - an incipient radical sense of a literal flight from capitalism: He abandons his booty in exchange for pure, abstract power, as if to expose to the self-regarding insurance detective her own materialistic limitations. In this, our arch-capitalist who operates on such a god-like level of finance and irresponsible freedom is both like Godard's egregiously self-conscious Olympian film magnate, Mr. Prokosch, and like a sinister super-Raffles who has coldly repudiated the humanity of any emulation of the politically moralistic Robin Hood legend. He possesses more awful dignity than the first, and all the glamour of the last two figures. In terms of 1968, he is Che Guevara without a soul. He is in fact the Miltonic Angel of selfish materialism, who falls.The film works as if it was propaganda for the two amoral leads, but the objective perfection of the medium's relentless gaze eventually transforms our superficial admiration, for the expensively-dressed and produced- artifice, into critical distance. An identical irony is produced in the viewer as has already overtaken the sardonic Satan of McQueen's impeccable criminal mastermind - a man bad merely because he can be, and who is therefore an utterly irredeemable character.Style in the (contemporary) Nouvelle Vague often represents an incursion of honest craftsmanship into repetitive, industrialized formula film-making, thereby transforming the experience in the direction of human and/or political integrity. Style in this particular instance of it, in TCA, is the quintessence of Hollywood's complete mastery of formula and technique to consciously represent the ultimate reduction of the human elements to the sheer mechanical perfection of superficial performance.Such perfect, jewelled machinery steals the heart right out of this film. Even Kubrick might have been proud of it.Style in the French N.V. often acts as the messenger for the director's humanity. Style in the brittle Hollywood vehicle repels humanity - hermetically seals it out. Perhaps paradoxically, but entirely logically, both strategies are connected, in this instance, and operate to the same critical, subversive ends.Perhaps (one reflects) it is ultimately the great Haskell Wexler's film: He habitually employed his superb capitalist, industrial, technocratic skills in the service of radical causes (as may be seen in, for instance, his Vietnam War-era documentaries). Perhaps Jewison's greatest contribution to this film was in just letting Wexler, as his cameraman, parody so coolly the glamorous excess of power by means of his own greater understanding of the uses of such power? Thus are the superficially human character's internal contradictions wittily and drily exposed. Illusion upon seductive illusion begets transparency. The film's disengaged formal perfection exposes illusion, by implying a more analytical light. The intensely intellectual projection of this cerebral film plays best in the back of the mind. The fundamentally cold exclusion of the ordinary from the industrialized dream-world of Hollywood is ruthlessly demonstrated to the extent that our human consciousness rebels. We do witness the fall of a veritable Angelic aristocracy into the pit of mere materialism. The world of the film is at once formally beautiful and morally repellent.Indeed, the film works best as a drily satirical take on the whole notion of Capitalism: Assured poise is really no more than a brittle and pretentious pose. Posing is certainly what both Stars do supremely well, here.Only otherwise in Godard have I experienced deconstruction as such an utterly exhilerating process! There is certainly a creative revolutionary film-maker at work here, whether it is principally Jewison or Wexler. Of course the film does appear dated - the characters are being systematically broken down from the moment they appear. They are being falsified by their defining limitation within a fashionable moment. Their ruthless mechanical stripping-bare, by the film process, absolutely required to be located in the opulent material trappings of their particular zeitgeist, in order for that political striptease to work!Such exposures of false consciousness are by their very nature timeless. The 'dated' element is the discarded husk of 1968. The film, as a cunning political artifice, flourishes the more thereby.In the knowing Brechtian tension between identifying with the artificial whilst simultaneously being alienated from such artifice, we are privileged to engage with a creative dialectic that puts us democratically on a par with the artist - the director himself. Would that more of today's films were constructed, like this, in order to convey experience at the deeper, intellectual level! (But do we not live in a theme-park for the purveying of mere animal sensation?)</fullReview>

All of us like to watch the master con, and especially when it involves a battle of superior wits.

		<fullReview>For the 60s it was an excellent film. I didn't see it then and watched it only after being riveted by the 1999 remake (See my comment there). And, boy oh boy, how slow and tedious it seemed. Took me about a third of the film to get used to the pace.The duo of Steven McQueen and Faye Dunaway is so smoothly interacting. There is the small, comparing to Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo performance, hint of the natural algorithm of man/woman relational mysteries.Another dynamic in common for both these films is the drive of a near omnipotent person to seek excitement in a crime or/and deception of authority in order to prove their ability to succeed in that also.The history of our culture of the 3 decades between 1968 and 1999 is so amply illustrated by the difference in the technique, rhythm, pace and openness of the characters. It is fascinating to anticipate what will bring us the 2010 re-remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, it's flashy. Yeah, Faye Dunaway's perfect acting is neatly tempered by ill-conceived fashion and too much make-up. But Steve McQueen still shines as the dashing yet existential millionaire who confounds the city of Boston with a heist, only to get into a romantic repartee with the investigator brought in to track him down.The movie is noted for its use in split-screen, which are indeed playful and in the best cases show multiple synchronized actions in different areas in a fresh and original way (in the worst times, it's merely a kaleidoscopic curiosity). It's not exactly the first time split screen has been used--heck, I've seen a short film from the 1920s that used two screens, half of the time for an underdeveloped widescreen-like effect and the other half of the time to show the character's mental state at the same time as the character's actions--but people excited by the 90s split-screen techniques of New Cool cinema (Jackie Brown, e.g.) can take note.And, of course, some major fun to be had in the chemistry between Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway. These are two sexy actors who portray some fascinating characters that manage a dramatic relationship with compelling emotional responses. Your eyes will burn, and you will LOVE IT.Plus, I mean, Steve McQueen is a badass. And like always, he's given some mighty neat vehicles to toy around with.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not the best McQueen movie but pretty good, a lot better than the Pierce Brosnan remake. It falls down a bit on storyline but it makes good in other ways, the direction is good and the chemistry between McQueen and Dunaway is explosive. Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 'Cat-and-Mouse' Game Between a Charming and Millionaire Thief and a Gorgeous and Classy Investigator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thomas Crown (Steve McQueen) is a bon-vivant millionaire who plans and executes a perfect heist to a bank. The detail is that none of the four members of the gang knows each other and the robbery has no failures. Vicky Anderson (Faye Dunaway, very beautiful and classy) is the smart insurance investigator in charge to find out the criminals. Although using split screen (a state-of art technique in 1968) and having an old fashioned soundtrack, therefore becoming aged, this full of surprises movie is still very charming. Faye Dunaway is very elegant and together with the handsome Steve McQueen, will play a 'cat-and-mouse' game, with many turning plots along the story. The chess game is indeed an erotic game between them (again, this is a 1968 movie, where the moral values of the society where far distant from today) and probably with the last scene of the movie, is for me the best parts of this movie. It is a worthwhile entertainment. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Crown, O Magnfico" ("The Magnificent Crown")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excellent movie, but just not my idea of a Steve McQueen vehicle. He just doesn't look like he should wear a three piece suit. He comes off as being uncomfortable in it. And Faye dunaway is too tall to play opposite McQueen.However, I bought the tape, and this original is a heck of a lot better than the recent remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original is better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today was the first time I had ever heard anyone claim that the remake of The Thomas Crown Affair was better. I simply do not see it.The original has a higher caliber of actors and it is "original". The newer version spoon feeds viewers who are too lazy to grasp a plot. In fact, not only was today the first day I have ever heard someone claim that the remake was better but it is so in contrast to popular belief that I thought I was actually reading a bad review of the remake.I just watched the original again last evening for the first time in 15 years and I could not stop mocking the remake. Don't get me wrong, I am not against remakes. I recently saw the remake of The Manchurian Candidate which surprised me. It was done very well. Not all remakes are bad. Not all originals are better. In this case however, the original Thomas Crown Affair is the better of the two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It makes Chess sexy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pure 60's chic and very sexy. McQueen cast against type and it works brilliantly and Dunaway is the super sexy ice queen out to get her man in more ways than one. What I love about this movie is that we are presented with two, admitedly selfish and ruthless people and yet we're drawn into the cat and mouse game between them. Which one will prove the more cool and cunning in the end. Add to that brilliant set pieces from Jewison, the stylish split screen (used brilliantly), fantastic cinematography and a great soundtrack from Michel Legrand (and what a title song). OK, I'm a fan of 60's style and this film has it! Shame they had to ruin things with a dreadful remake that misses the whole point of the story and sorry, Rene Russo just cannot hold a candle to Faye Dunaway, who manages to steal every scene she's in, in the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grossly overrated; nowhere near as good as the Pierce Brosnan version.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Australia, this movie was shown on free TV the night before the opening of the remake, so we got to see both versions within a few days. And I found this version bitterly disappointing. The 1960s clothes really date this piece, but of course that's not a fault of this movie as such.Steve McQueen, like (for example) Clint Eastwood, Charles Bronson, Humphrey Bogart, Tommy Lee Jones, only ever plays himself. And while "Steve McQueen as Steve McQueen" works extremely well in "Bullitt" or "The Blob", in this movie it is a total disaster. He may be a very masculine and tough guy, but the suave Thomas Crown he is not. He is so self-conscious that I found myself waiting for him to look into the camera. The part where he has a romance with some other woman only to annoy Faye Dunaway is particularly appalling.Faye Dunaway tries hard to rescue the movie, and she plays her part well. This is a movie that requires two people with acting ability; so she can hardly be expected to carry the entire movie on her own. It's not enough. The movie is very poor. 1 star out of 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Puts the Remake to Shame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, I like Pierce Brosnan, but if any film should not have been re-made it was this film. The thing that was so appealing about it was the lack of technology. This film survived solely on story alone. It wasn't really about how the heist went down, but how the heist wast was orchesrted. The sexual tension between the two leads was unparrelled. The cat and mouse game so paramount to the plot, how could you remake it without the same passion. The score as well as the songs deserved and won the Oscar. The limitations of the time (e.g. special FX) forced Norman Jewison to focus on characters, which made the film all that much enjoyable. If you want to experience the best heist movie, definitely view this one...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No wonder the rich can't fit through the eye of a needle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did anybody else think the theme song was done too up tempo? Good song, though. I think were I as stinking rich as Mr. Crown I would be so appreciative that I would be in a permanent state of euphoria. His warped personality couldn't be satisfied with anything: winning; losing: it was all the same to the ultra bored Herr Crown. Even after he was in jeopardy of going to the slammer for a long time, he continued to foolishly joust against the odds; arrogantly flaunting his smug superiority in front of the authorities. I think the small smile he gave as he was flying to Europe after the big heist spoke loudly about his unfeeling, thankless attitude toward every thing he came into contact with. Good film, but the re-make was quite a bit more exciting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is really interesting. Faye Dunaway looks stunning, and Steve McQueen.. well he's Steve McQueen. The music is as much a classic as the film and worth seeing the film for if for nothing else: "Windmills of your mind". I would have given this movie an even higher score except some of the late 60's early 70's effects are quite cheesy by today's standards and even annoying. But it's worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was one step ahead of plain action movies. It tried to emphasize on the McQueen - Dunaway interaction. I think they (and especially Faye Dunaway) could have done a lot better. Also a more coherent and twisted plot would be a plus. Another point worth mentioning is the directing, which was certainly pioneering.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stars, Casting, Music, Creative Split Screen Imagery All Make For One of the very best Films of the Late '60's and a Unique, One-of-a-Kind Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The big night finally came! The lovely young Lady that was to me the current heart-throb was accompanying meself to see a movie on a real date! It was to be a Tag-Team event, as we went double with some friends; which certainly was acceptable. (He had a new car, as opposed to my, uh, well d'ya 'member Archie's jalopy in the comic books?) So, because this was the days of "1st Run, Exclusive Engagements", the movie we all wanted to see, THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR (Mirisch Corp. /United Artists, 1968) was playing in Downtown, the Chicago Loop.WE went in and saw the picture. A good time was had by all, and then the journey was reversed. We split up, they went their way, me and the Fox went ours. A short time later, it was "Good Night" (in all fairness, it was a Wednesday evening) and "We should do this again SOMETIME!" Although NOT much of a Date, the Film we saw must be numbered among the very best of its era, and high on anyone's "All-Time Rankings!" Jewison was fresh from IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT (Mirisch Corp./United Artists, 1967) and was at the top of his creative game when he signed Mr. Steve McQueen to play the title character.In casting the Female Lead, Mr. Jewison wanted to get someone fresh and asked Miss Faye Dunaway recently in Warren Beatty vehicle, BONNIE &amp; CLYDE (Tatria-Hiller Prod./Warner Brothers-7 Arts, 1967). Starting with the "Beautiful People" couple in the Lead Roles, solid support was sought. Two of the parts were of particularly importance to the success of the story. The assignment as Detective Lt. Eddy Malone, Boston P.D., went to the masterful Paul Burke. Jack Weston manned the chores as the slightly hen-pecked and financially strapped salesman turned conspirator, Erwin Weaver. Among those others who are recruited to carry out their own individual parts of the plan of battle is a young Yaphett Kotto, who would soon see his own Star steadily rising in the Hollywood Zodiac.OUR STORY (at Last!)???..The life of one Boston Financial Tycoon, one Thomas "Tommy" Crown has become ever so highly successful in the Business World. His own personal life is as dull and lifeless as his mercantile pursuits are "hot." Like most Rich Guys, he can afford to lay out a good chunk of cold ca$h in order to get some illicit kicks. So, the very secretive Mr. Crown gets his kicks by masterminding super-capers.One by one, and with his own true identity remaining unknown to them, Crown would hire his conspirators. Secretly giving all instructions to each of the members of the "Gang", who remained unknown to each other, Tommy is the Mastermind; who plots it all out and ultimately pulls all of the strings.Finally the big day comes and each of the 5 hired hands gets his instructions from Mr. Crown by way of banks of public telephones. All of the conspirators are dressed in about as plain a manner as is possible. Every player knows his role and will only recognize the others when they perform their portion of the master play.Erwin (Mr. Weston) has the assignment to purchase a new Ford Station Wagon and to have it positioned to be the receiver of the robbery's proceeds, then to drop it off at the predetermined place. At this spot, he changes his State License Plates from Massachusetts to New York and then to proceed back through the massive road-block; returning home, where he would be later contacted. Like all the others, Erwin performs his tasks without a flaw, but he proves to be the weak-link in this Tommy Crown Caper.A massive investigation is initiated by the Boston Police under the coordination of Detective Lieutenant Eddy Malone; but soon the full co-operation and resources of the insurance industry is added. Eventually the private sector "suits" decide to put their end of the investigation in control of their super femme fatal investigatress (whoops,definitely not P.C.), 'scuse me, I meant the neuter and unisex designation of "Investigator." Enter the intuitive Miss Vicki Anderson (Miss Faye Dunaway).Miss Anderson has her own way of doing things. In addition to the essential elements of interviews and running down any 'tips &amp; clues', she goes with feelings, hunches and her masterfully developed "Feminine Intuition." She takes up the trail on Mr. Crown, strictly on a hunch. She carefully shadows him, secretly films him at play in his Polo Matches. She "just knows" that he is their man. So she zeroes in on him, dialing it up to being a personal thing.It starts out with a simple luncheon, but rapidly escalates to a more "friendly" situation. They start to see a lot of each other, so Vicki the temptress, the seductress gives forth a full broadside of tricks. Using all the tricks and tools at her disposal (including, er-a, s-e-x!) to try to set him up! A trap is baited and set for the suspected mastermind; but, there is, by that time, just one slight complication. She has fallen in love with him.Mr. Jewison took all the finest elements, including the sound track by Michelle LeGrand that featured the extremely beautiful &amp; mysterious "Windmills of your Mind." And now we return to my social life, ca. 1968. Well, as it turned out do to my work schedule on the "Dog Watch" (Police Department jargon for midnight to morning shift) and the Fox's social schedule, my "turn" didn't come around for several weeks. While talking' on the phone about where we could go, the subject of this last film, THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR came up. To which Miss Space Pants replied; "Oh, did I see that with you?" Wait! Did this really happen, or was my mind confusing reality with James Cagney &amp; Rita Hayworth in THE STRAWBERRY BLONDE (Warner Brothers, 1942)?</fullReview>
