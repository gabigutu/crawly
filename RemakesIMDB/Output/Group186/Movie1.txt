		<shortDescription>Best movie I have ever seen!!! thoughtful and sincere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not really a movie, but a play that was filmed. I saw this years ago in my high school humanities class. Gregory Harrison's acting is superb in this -- I have NEVER seen him better in any other movie since. His facial expressions are priceless beyond any acting I have ever seen. WOW! Perry King is perfectly cast. Unlike his stupid TV show "Riptide", it is apparent that Perry King has great acting ability. He will amaze you. I cannot say enough good things about this film. It moved me. I cried. If you are an emotional person (at least inside) this movie will move you like few films will. I think it is TRAGIC that this is long out of print, rare and hard to find. I give this movie 20 stars!! I won't spoil any of it for those of you have not had the good fortune to see it. If only more movies were as thoughtful as this one!! I think John Patrick (who wrote the play) must be brilliant.</fullReview>
