		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Why, Billy Ray, why? It's not surprising that Hollywood green-lighted the Americanization of the 2010 Oscar winner for Best Foreign Language film, El secreto de sus ojos. That original from Argentina is exemplary filmmaking and a thoroughly entertaining and compelling mystery-thriller; a must-see for any true film lover. Even if an Oscar-studded cast is hired (2 Oscar winners, 8 nominations), the guiding inspiration for a remake should be more than losing the subtitles and filming Julia Roberts without make-up.The story balances two timelines spanning 13 years. Jess (Ms. Roberts) is an investigator who works with FBI Agent Ray (Chiwetel Ejiofor), Assistant District Attorney Claire (Nicole Kidman), and a blustering District Attorney played by Alfred Molina. When Jess' daughter is brutally murdered, the investigation is impacted by the suspect's role as a department snitch. When we catch up all those years later, the unrequited attraction between now former FBI Agent Ray and now DA Claire is as strong as ever; Jess' appearance is on par with someone suffering from a terminal illness, and the murder still hovers over these characters as if it had occurred last week.It's a fascinating story that was handled superbly in the original, yet mostly comes across as uninspired in this latest project. At times, it's even a bit confusing in how the two eras are handled. The score from Emilio Kauderer and a couple of fine scenes from Ms. Roberts (although she gets no credit here for appearing sans-makeup) are the best parts of this one. Otherwise, Mr. Ejiofor (usually a fine actor) goes over-the-top, while Ms. Kidman is simply miscast and unable to generate the proficiency required for her position. Other support work comes courtesy of Dean Norris ("Breaking Bad"), Michael Kelly ("House of Cards") and Zoe Graham.Other than lacking the grit and realism of the original, the editing and camera work (so exceptional in the first version) at times come off as amateurish this time around. The soccer/futbol sequence from the original is replaced with Dodgers baseball (Chavez Ravine and Vin Scully) and a link to former Manager Walt Alston. Normally that would be considered an improvement, but again, these fall short and fail to generate the necessary suspense. A weak impersonation of the famous long-tracking shot certainly doesn't help.For anyone who hasn't seen writer/director Juan Jose Campanella's (an Executive Producer here) excellent original, this version from Billy Ray (Shattered Glass) might prove interesting enough; however, those same folks are strongly encouraged to instead track down the original, and experience the emotional depth and filmmaking expertise that made it such a worthy Oscar winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood, go to your room.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood, we spoke about this just last week. I know you're young and I know that sometimes means you want to steal ideas from others and think that by changing language and adding "stars" you will make something better but you know it doesn't work. We talked about 9 Quenns just the other day but now you've done it again. A poetic, heartbreaking, beautifully acted, thriller from Argintinia gets turned into barely watchable mush. So, go to you room, no dinner and don't do it again. And once you have realised the error of your ways we will watch the original and realise that having to read and watch a film isn't the end of the world and even better, opens you up to the idea that the action, the great stories, the films that treat the viewer as an adult, generally, don't come out of Hollywood anymore. Argintinia alone has been steadily putting out gem after gem, maybe we will have a mini fest on that country's output and forget bad remakes for a while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you haven't seen "El Segreto de sus ojos" I beg you to stop reading and go check it out, it is, in my opinion, one of those rare and pure thrillers that keeps you glued to the screen for two hours. Yet, despite loving the original, I wasn't going into this one ready to bitch about it. I am someone who is very sniffy about remakes, but hey if you have an fascinating premise that can be explored through various styles and dynamics I am all for it. Especially in this case, I think that keeping some of the core material and turning other parts completely around could have made for a fascinating narrative, unfortunately the American remake, with the exception of maybe two or three ides, doesn't improve, explore or further the original in anyway and sometimes even edges the shot-by-shot remake treatment.Look, this isn't a terrible thriller, but the emotional beats you are carried through are just the same of the original, it really seemed to be watching a cheap version of it. It is way too reminiscent of the original and at some moments I really felt exactly when I saw it. Whilst at other moments I kind of felt sorry for the remake because it doesn't manage to replicate some of the amazing photography the first one had and actually miserably fails: this film has some really, noticeably cheap cinematography and editing.The performances are all kind of off beat. Julia Roberts is definitely the best one, even though she also has some low points. The rest of the cast is just flat honestly. Nobody even tries to come in and give it some palpable passion. The film is also inconsistent with tone and I am not sure they understood the fascination of the original because a lot of the focus points are just sidelined or shoehorned in.That's also a real bummer, because the film does have just a couple of good ideas that aren't simply built on. They tread too much of the same ground and do it in a way that is simply too familiar. I can maybe think of one thing that was improved upon and that is mainly thanks to Julia Roberts' talent. The score is something that positively sticks out and probably the purest good thing to come out of the film.In the end we are treated to a fine thriller that doesn't live up to its potential and only manages to justify its length thanks to memories of the original and the same emotions instead of relevant improvement and originality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only sensible reason to watch this pathetic disaster is for the students of cinema, cinematography and everything related, and analysts (professional and amateurs) as a study. It is not first neither last time Hollywood butchered great script and created mockery of art. "Abre los ojos" and "Vanilla sky", "Solaris" (though if you never seen the Tarkowsky's original it may appear as not so bad) now the Campanella masterpiece. I can see his name in the credits, wow, is his financial situation so bad ? Was Juan Jose really part of this remake ? If so than this is sad indeed. There is no tension, no suspense and sorry to say it made me realise even more how outstanding was Soledad Villamil and Ricardo Darin. Shame that the non Spanish speaking world may never enjoy their outstanding films. Darin is probably one of the greatest actors of our times. What they created in the original film was amazing. "El secreto de sus ojos" was a revelation to me, watched it several times and after that all the films of Juan Jose Campanella and of Ricardo Darin, that film opened to me the fascinating world of Argentinian cinema. This thing, reminds me of old recipe from the pop music world "simplify then exaggerate". Another Hollywood fail</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Rating: &#x2606;&#x2606; out of 4)This film is not recommended. In brief: The real crime is remaking this remake.GRADE: C+Hollywood rarely improves upon a remake, especially in the foreign film genre. Such is the case, once again, in Secret in Their Eyes. Based on its far better source, the 2010 Oscar- winning Argentine film bearing the same name, this version unduly complicates an already complicated plot with political corruption and a terrorist back-story that does little to enhance the story. Whereas, both films intermesh the crime tale with a love story between its two central characters, the American reboot fails to successfully engage its audience with the latter storyline. &#xfffc;Written and directed by Billy Ray, this film tells the story of an unsolved murder that has haunted its characters for over a decade. The filmmaker takes the essence of the earlier film and unlike that film, raises the stakes by wisely personalizes the murder this time around. Ray Caston and Jess Cobb are two FBI agents who arrive at the crime scene, only to discover that the victim is Jess's daughter, Carolyn. Her death haunts both agents over the years, including the acting DA, Claire, who happens to be Ray's unrequited love. Throughout the past 13 years, Ray continues to hunt for Carolyn's killer and believes he has finally found the culprit. He wants the case reopened and to also reopen his relationship with his object of affection as well.&#xfffc;An interesting premise, but the crime story never builds to much excitement and the love story seems to go nowhere. A capable cast has been assembled with Chiwetel Ejiofor as the brooding detective assigned to the case. Even though the actor tries valiantly to add some depth to his weakly-drawn character, he still comes across as an unhinged vigilante rather than heroic cop. This character never seems realistic or believable as written, nor do any of the characters in this version. A miscast Nicole Kidman plays Claire as an ice princess type and has zero chemistry with Mr. Ejiofor. In fact, the only reason to see this remake is the powerful acting done by Julia Roberts as the grieving mother. The actress downplays her beauty and gives a remarkably nuanced performance that deserves Oscar consideration.&#xfffc;As for the film itself, the script is muddled and the flashback format's choppiness doesn't help matters. One can only tell past versus present events by the hair and make-up aging process (or lack there of with Ms. Roberts). Some of the supporting characters (an unethical officer, the overly ambitious politician, the trusty sidekick, etc.) become stereotypes and the dialog is standard TV crime drama. Secret in Their Eyes is a crime thriller without much thrills. The murder mystery just does not blend with the love story and the moviegoer becomes its final victim. Rent the Argentine film instead to see how to skillfully combine both genres.&#xfffc;NOTE: In my original review (June 3, 2010, go to archives in this blog to read it, if interested), I bemoan the fact back then that remakes are a less quality. Somethings just don't improve with age. Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad quality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie because of the actresses: Julia Roberts and Nicole Kidman. Usually they know how to choose the movie they participate in. With that script they gave them they did what they could. The other actor "Chiwetel Ejiofor" was not good at all. It is fine to adapt an excellent movie (The original one is from Argentina and was a real masterpiece), but at least the adaptation should show that some original work was done. Even if I knew the story, I found it hard to follow at the end. I can only imagine how somebody that did know the story would feel. I do not recommend this movie at all. I strongly recommend the original one: El secreto de sus ojos (2009).</fullReview>

Kept my interest the whole time, all the leads were strong and believable, never a big Julia Roberts fan, she was outstanding in this, I certainly don't agree with the reviewers that said Nicole Kidman was miscast, I thought she was excellent, you don't get to be an A grade Academy Award winner by being a bad actress! Perhaps it's not as good as the original are they ever? But it stands on it's own, and would be in my top ten for this year ,not that it has a lot to beat? Far as I could tell, everyone in the theater enjoyed it! Hey! It's a movie, not brain surgery!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flop In Their Eyes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Secret In Their Eyes is a movie that will break your heart for what it could have been. The best part is the cast. Julia Roberts, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Nicole Kidman have garnered attention for their presence, but we also have doing supporting duties Dean Norris, and Michael Kelly. The film opens with the brutal death of Jess's daughter. The moment Jess finds her daughter and the inexplicable grief that follows is a shattering and powerful moment. The prosecution and how justice will be parceled out to a police officer, a country, and ultimately a parent is the crux of Billy Ray's third directorial effort. This case which transcends from 2002 to 2015 fails to find its center through a milquetoast romance between the characters of Ray and Claire. The unrequited love and smoldering passion these two are supposed to feel is not there, and the film falls through the center. Kidman never settles fully into her role. Kidman, who excels in more offbeat work, becomes a stoic non-entity in the film. Ray does not adequately structure the transitions between time periods, nor do the actors convey any change in demeanor and attitude to assist the audience. This lack of emotional tension restricts the audience into a state of indifference the film does not have the quality or tension to transcend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Run-of-the-Mill Thriller/Murdery Mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When compared to the original film, "El secreto de sus ojos," from which this version derives, "Secret in Their Eyes" is a tremendous letdown. The earlier version, which won the Academy Award for best foreign language picture in 2009 was a compelling yarn with a stylistic flair.At first glance, "Secret in Their Eyes" had unlimited potential due to the stellar cast, including Nichole Kidman, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Julia Roberts, plus outstanding character actors Alfred Molina and Michael Kelly. All of these performers have outstanding range, yet the script left them with few options in interpreting their one-dimensional roles.Another major problem with this film was in the constant use of flashbacks. The two main timeframes were separated by thirteen years, and the attempts made to age the actors were unsuccessful. At times, it was difficult for the viewer even to keep straight which of the two periods was being portrayed.The gist of the story is a complicated reopening of a cold case murder file in which the daughter of one of the police officers was brutally killed. The bureaucratic red tape that stifled the crime investigation was not believable. Nearly all of the plot twists and complications were equally fraught with credibility problems.There is a big "payoff scene" at the end with a surprise ending. But that moment was set up so poorly that it never had the payoff. "Secret in Their Eyes" never rose to the occasion of the well-crafted film from Argentina.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yesterday I have watched the movie " secret in their eyes " starring Julia Roberts and nicole kidman. . The movie is a remake of the Argentinian movie " el secreto de sus ojos " the Oscar winning movie 2010 for best foreign movie The remake was not up to the same standard or emotional impact of the first film .. I couldn't live the same thriller mystery atmosphere I had watching the original film Even they couldn't deliver the whole moto of the movie which was that if you wanna know the secret of a person you look in his eyes as it will reveal his deepest passion and emotions Neither could they deliver the deep intense emotional suffering of the hopeless love of the investigator to his boss In the original movie it was a young woman brutally raped and killed by an old school mate and the investigator could point out who the killer was only by the look of his eyes to her in All her photos which revealed passion reaching the level of obsession And as the movie went on they showed us the determination of her loving grieving husband who dedicated his life just for finding the killer and to punish him by life sentence and when justice failed him he decided to take matters by his own hands and lied to the investigator that he killed him but because the latter knew the husband wouldn't relief the killer by ending his life he followed him to his house to discover he has held the killer captive in a cage for the past 25 yrs feeding and nourishing him to live and rotten in his prison to pay for his deeds When the investigator saw the killer in the cage the killer begged him to just make the husband talk to him .. for 25 yrs he brought him food everyday and never had a word with him to torture him even a more torture than what he would have got in prison That was his revenge and justice In the remake it was a cops daughter " Julia Roberts " who dedicated her life as well to find and revenge for the killer and had also kept him captive in her prison for 13 yrs emotionally torturing him and never talking to him.. they changed the ending by the investigator giving her a gun to kill the man who killed her daughter not to take revenge from him but to relieve herself from the same prison she locked herself into and starting her life all over again so they killed and buried him The ending of the original movie in my opinion was so much more intense and served the whole meaning of revenge even if it meant the husband was locked up in the idea of revenge with his prisoner as already his life ended by the act of murder of the love of his life The addition made in the remake kind of spoilt this meaning and cooled off the intensity of the whole master scene of the cage and suffering of the killer I give the remake 4/10 and I guess it would hardly win any prizes compared to the 10/10 I give to the original version That's the reason I prefer non American movies especially Latin and Spanish movies That was my critic review for the movie and if you are intending to watch this one I advise you to watch the original one " el secreto de sus ojos " It's a must watch piece of art you won't regret to watch MINO</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie with high hopes to have a couple of entertaining hours, but boy was I wrong. The movie starts OK and then shifts towards a terrible plot with unbelievable (in the bad way) scenes. FBI agents trying to capture a man and fail miserably more then once, the mother's victim leaving her best friend tormented for 13 years without telling him the truth, 2 people attracted to each other and both are afraid to come forward. (In which century are we?). Terrible, terrible movie. Oh and I forgot, the mother's victim agrees to make a bust that leads to an agent's death knowing that the culprit is not amongst the busted! A complete waste of time. The only positive thing is Nicole Kidman, she's gorgeous!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stick with the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there was ever a prime example of a harmless yet utterly pointless Hollywood remake of a much better yet underseen foreign film it's Billy Ray's Secret in Their Eyes, a thriller that crashed and burned upon release late last year in the midst of a barely there marketing campaign and reviews that were middling at best, despite an awards friendly named cast and a story that should've been exhilarating only to end up as a sporadically intriguing mystery.Before delving any further into the occasional virtues of Ray's film (who's never really gone the next step from his breakout Shattered Glass from 2003), those that've never seen Juan José Campanella's Academy Award winning 2009 film of the same name from Spain should stop reading right now and seek it out as it's one of the finest thrillers of the modern era with its standout out scripting, frenetic action scenes (a soccer stadium chase is breathtaking in its design), outstanding cast and final reveal that will leave jaws dropping on floors.This Hollywood update of the original try's to relive many of the originals past glories like the incendiary final reveal and even the stadium foot chase, this time transported to a disappointing baseball stadium setting, but the film feels somewhat lethargic overall and revelations and confronting situations that simmered in the 2009 film merely fizzle here despite the best effort of its loaded cast.Filling in the role that was once earmarked for Denzel Washington, Chiwetel Ejiofor is the films anchor as determined investigator Ray Kastan and he acquits himself well to a fairly intense role but struggles to draw out sufficient chemistry with his female co-stars Nicole Kidman and Julia Roberts, who continue on with their recent forgettable efforts with turns that required their experienced skill sets to do a little more with what they were given even though Ray's plotting of the storyline leaves much to be desired with its flash back structure, even the films big finish is somewhat hampered by some sloppy editing that intrudes on the present moment.At its heart, Secret in Their Eyes has an extremely appealing narrative that helps cover up many of this particular incarnation's left wanting deliveries but it can't help override the fact that this unnecessary remake isn't even a patch on its foreign forefather and quite clearly wasn't as appealing to western audiences as the studio obviously thought it would've been.2 ? limping Hank's out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not seen the original, didn't even know there was one until I began reading the reviews and I will definitely be watching the original after this as for this Americanized Hollywood version there is very little redeeming about it. Roberts does a wonderful job as a grieving mother, some of the supporting roles also did quite well. Many of the characters I had a hard time believing, including Kidman who seemed to be sleepwalking through this. The story was so-so, the time transitions and camera work rather confusing at times. Very little if anything really differentiated the time lines and it took a few seconds to realize what time we were in for each scene, especially when all the characters look exactly alike after 13 years. Have i mentioned the bad camera-work? Which goes along with bad directing. I mean honestly how does swinging the camera back and forth for close ups with a box between them make sense for a good shot?Despite the Oscar caliber cast it's not worth your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original, "El secreto de sus ojos" is a masterpiece of cinema and story. Not just the premise but you get to see the justice system of Argentina and Spain. It's pretty interesting since we are saturated with the American justice system.Very much unlike the US and similar to France (Engrenages is a great French police procedural TV series). People either cannot or will not watch foreign cinema or have difficulty with subtitles. I understand that it is a challenge in that your eyes are diverted from the screen, the cultures are unfamiliar or the intonation can be confusing. Cinema and literature is escapism. Step outside of the box. I'm hearing impaired and use subs for all TV programs. I acknowledge that it's easier for me. Hollywood ruins spectacular foreign films. If American audiences want to see less engaging movies, there are films for that. And that's fine. We call them "guilty pleasures" or "no brainers."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a thrilling secret.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood has done it again! They have taken a successful and well made foreign film and produced a second rate theatrical release that has failed to create an impact that would be considered worthy of being mentioned in the same breathe as the original. The only thing that has saved Director Billy Ray's remake is the wealth of talent that he has been able to bring along for the ride. With a cast of prominent Oscar winners involved, 'Secret in their Eyes' should have been much more than what it ended up being - a struggling thriller that failed to boil.I must admit that I am not familiar with the 2009 release of the Argentinian Oscar winning film, 'El secreto de sus ojos' so it would be unfair of me to directly compare the two but by all reports it is a thoroughly recommended thriller worthy of the accolades that it received at the time of its release. Because of its undoubted success, the wise and powerful elite from Movieland, felt compelled to make an English version that has been rewritten for the mass market but has forgotten one important lesson; big names doesn't mean great chemistry. In saying this though, the names of Roberts and Kidman do get the average punter to the box office and into the cinema. With very little time spent on marketing, a film like this is going to rely on the talent at hand but also must live up to expectations put upon it. Sadly it just lacked the atmosphere that puts the audience into a suspended trance whilst being on the edge of their seat.'Secret in their Eyes' centres around a trio of characters that have their lives changed forever following a harrowing crime. Ray (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Jess (Julia Roberts) are young investigators attached to an FBI task force based in Los Angeles not long after the tragic events of 9/11. Their main purpose is to weed out any threats of terrorism that might have a detrimental effect on the citizens of the city. Ray and Jess along with the rest of the task force have been focusing on a mosque that could be harbouring such extremist cells. The new assistant to the District Attorney, Claire (Nicole Kidman) has caught the eye of Ray and a very confusing courtship follows until an unforgettable incident happens in a garage next to the mosque that they have all been investigating. Thirteen years pass and the trio of Ray, Jess and Claire are reunited. Ray is now in private security, Jess is still with the Fed's and Claire is now the District Attorney of L.A. The events of the past have haunted all three but with Ray's determination, he relentlessly pursues the case that had such a disastrous affect on him personally, hoping for justice and to right the wrongs of the past.'Secret in their Eyes' had such potential but it was let down by a story that cannot keep a constant flow. The narrative keeps moving back and forth from the past to the present without building any real tension. Billy Ray gives the audience too much credit in thinking that they are following the events presented to them and on many occasions you could be forgiven for being confused about which time line the film is actually in.Roberts and Ejiofor are quite brilliant in their delivery of characters that are torn apart by a tragic event. Both are thoroughly convincing in their roles, fully engaged and manage to give the film some aspect of authenticity. It just goes to show how good these two actors really are. They are able to bring a solid performance to a narrative that lacks any evidence of a 'wow factor'. Unfortunately, Nicole Kidman cannot enjoy the same positive review for her performance. This is an actor that for too long has been over rated and her lack of skill and emotion comes to the surface alongside two outstanding craftspeople. Kidman struggles to look real. Her presence doesn't have any genuine warmth about it, and because of this, many scenes involving her character do seem a little overworked. Her relationship with Ejiofor's character, Ray, was supposed to create an atmosphere that would compliment the film on a whole. Instead, Ray and Claire seemed lifeless together and the courtship quickly became unrealistic.All in all, 'Secret in their Eyes' is average without being anything special. Argentina's 'El secreto de sus ojos' will feel safe in knowing that it is by far the more superior version. Billy Ray's film simply is void of thrills and chemistry and without them the film suffers to find a pulse. At 111 minutes, viewers will be glad that it doesn't drag on more than it has to but if you want to see how brilliant actors are able to deliver rousing performances on a less than thrilling script then 'Secret in their Eyes' could be a fine example.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When reviewing a remake you cannot avoid to compare it with the original, and the original was damn near perfect, the storytelling, the acting and the scenes. The remake in my humble opinion, lacked the inspiration or the drive to deliver the thrill and emotions the original brought to the viewers.What made the original so good is the powerful scenes and the delivery of it, most of it was missing on this movie, for example in the remake the main protagonist just said "he was looking at her in the photos" it does not actually mention "there was something in their eyes" which for me was a powerful line, also the "passion" scene is not nearly as powerful as the one in the original which is one if not my most favorite scene. The flashbacks are also hard to differentiate from the present time.Over all it is still a must watch for those who loved the original, Julia Roberts, Chiwetel Ejiofo and Nicole Kidman were brilliant and they somehow brought justice to the film, but the original is just so good it will always be the one to stick with me when i hear this movie title.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Leave it to Hollywood to try to take a great original film and jazz it up with their politics and false polish. First let's toss in an interracial relationship and class structure to give everyone a teaching moment. Then lets change other details to make things seem even more compelling, dramatic and extraordinary. That's because the original film, which was great, just wasn't amped up enough.In the original film we watch a detective who has had a friendship with the DA. There are questions about "what if" regarding a current between them but, what drives the film, is the retired detective haunted by a crime he could not solve. A beautiful woman is raped and murdered in a terrible fashion and her lover is overcome with incredible sorrow. His reinvestigation into the murder also connects him with his loose end in his search to answer both questions. And the cast and script is riveting.In this film that doesn't happen. The person murdered is the daughter of one of the investigators, which goes unsolved. And then a team member returns many years later to reopen the case and question about the grieving mother and former team member and her zeal to find the murderer.I give it 1 star because I have to. I give it another star for the fact that I've seen much worse. But it is a tragedy that this film tears down the greatness of the original. On the bright side it isn't as pitifully bad as Spike Lee's Oldboy remake, which could be one of the worst ever. This is along the level of the remake of Spoorloss into "The Vanishing." Rip the essence out of what makes the movie great and try to throw your spin on something that really doesn't need fixing at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty well made film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Secret in their eyes (2015) is a pretty well made film, it's definitely well acted, great performances by all the cast including: Julie Roberts, Chiwetel, and Nicole Kidman, they all have very real powerful performances. The script is pretty good, not the best ever, but it works. The characters are well written too. The tense scenes and situations throughout really made this film, the mystery of not knowing certain things really keeps you interested too. I can without a doubt say that the actors performances were my favorite part of this film, they were just so amazing here! And the ending was my other favorite part, the ending is very clever and unexpected, or at least I didn't see it coming, which is awesome, because anyone who knows me knows how much I love a good surprise ending to a film. 7/10 for Secrets in their eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goes down as a bad remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So this was supposed to be a remake of the Argentinian flick "The Secret in their Eyes". Unfortunately this turned out to be one of the worst remakes ever made. Let us crawl slowly through the direction department: It isn't intense. Doesn't let you connect at all. The office romance of Chiwetel and Nicole lacks the chemistry it was supposed to reach. Billy Ray goes for two parallel story lines which further vexes the audience. Primary reason being, Chiwetel looks exactly the same in both time-lines, (his white beard is the only thing that could have probably pin pointed, and the flick's story, which as a matter of fact, compels you to spend minutes wondering what they are really talking about to grasp which time-line you are exactly in).Moving on to the plot front. So they did change the story a bit with the inclusion of Julia Roberts to the tale. Making her daughter a victim. The initial bits of the movie were quite powerful where she gives a power pack performance whilst grieving. Then she too gets bogged down by the flick's poor direction. Screenplay is sometimes fine, but at most junctures lanced by inappropriate editing. The story also lacks a proper Dirty War backdrop. Here 9/11 terrorism is taken into account for a distraught system. Although the plot of the movie runs directly on the rails of the Argentinian version, you incessantly feel something isn't right. Music of the movie isn't profound and is the detachable kind, not present at most of the crucial junctures. Nicole is pretty much simply there, expressionless yet sensuous. You almost don't figure out if Nicole was bluffing whilst challenging Marzin of his manhood. So poorly made! Even the final bits where everything was supposed to actually matter, things become so hazy and bleak you start thinking if it would end in a different fashion altogether.Chiwetel tries to hold every bit on his shoulders alone, but unfortunately falls in the muck of some weird unfeeling love and looks of his co-stars. A very bad remake, actually. Go watch the original!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'SECRET IN THEIR EYES': Three Stars (Out of Five)An American remake, of the 2009 Argentine thriller 'THE SECRET IN THEIR EYES' (which won the 2010 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film). The movie tells the story of a former FBI investigator, who's still trying to track down the killer, of his old partner's teenage daughter; 13 years later. The film stars Chiwetel Ejiofor, Julia Roberts, Nicole Kidman and Dean Norris. It was written and directed by Billy Ray; based on the Argentine book 'The Question in Their Eyes' (by Eduardo Sacheri), and the script adapted from it (written by Sacheri and Juan Jose Campanella). I saw the original movie, and it's a much better film!Two FBI agents, Ray (Ejiofor) and Jess (Roberts), are investigating the scene of a murder, when they discover that Jess's daughter (Zoe Graham) is the victim. They're able to track down, and arrest, the most likely suspect (Joe Cole); but he's set free, due to the fact that he's a government informant. Ray obsesses over the case, for 13-years, until he relocates the man, he thinks is the same suspect. He comes back to Los Angeles, after leaving the FBI, and asks his old supervisor (Kidman), who he's also long had feelings for, to reopen the case.The original Argentine film was fantastic; I gave it 4.5 stars (out of 5), back when I first saw it (in 2010). This movie is well-made, to a certain extent, and well-acted; but it definitely doesn't live up to the original. Ejiofor and Roberts both give outstanding performances, in the film though, like they always do; and the scene of Roberts finding her murdered daughter, is hauntingly memorable. The movie is worth seeing, just to watch the two of them.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/f4ptmnmXTWE</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grim not quite worth the time investment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With such star power I felt I had to watch this movie. But in the end I didn't like the movie. The grim story involves a cop and his partner, Chiwetel and Julia. He discovers her daughter murdered. The case isn't solved. Years later he returns to try and solve things.Chiwetel is in a lot of roles these days and he is earnest. But he doesn't have much chemistry with Nicole Kidman. She is a bit too glam and beautiful for the role. Out of place if they wanted to keep things believable. Julia Roberts sans makeup looks haggard and grim which suits the sad look for the second part.Yeah there is a partially feel good twist at the end but it feels kind of fake and emotionally distant.This is one of those forgettable movies that makes you ask why did you bother watching it. You don't feel entertained after it's over. It's not quite worth seeing every movie Julia Roberts appears in anymore</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How long one's eyes can keep secret!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My confession is I haven't seen the original film. I had several opportunities, but for various reasons I stayed unwatched till now. Firstly, I won't consider it a remake since both the films were adapted from a novel. Yet no one can stop the people comparing between the two, just to find out which one is true to the book. In my perspective, I think the original source was written keeping the Argentinian society, because that dark tone narration suits them. I have seen many Argentinian films, but for the American kind of storytelling, it does not appeal. Even though it was not a bad film, I somewhat enjoyed, maybe because I haven't seen the other version.The actors were great, but it was Chiwetel Ejiofor's film, He dominated the screenspace, and Nicole Kidman and Julia Roberts were slightly disappointed with their small roles. But overall, they all made it a decent film, particularly the direction impressed me for handling neatly knowing it is already once made a film. The story was suspenseful, yet it feels familiar and lets you predict the each scene before its commencement. Yes, I thought it was holding something big for the end part, and then it gives out all clues leading that way. So I kind of assumed what the end twist might be and that happened, but a bit differently.This kind of screenplay totally works for a Korean style filmmaking, but Hollywood is expert in a different field. Wherever it comes the film, a film is a film, so I won't blame it on a regional ground for lacking of something. But it should have been a bit better, maybe more thrilling and making the characters more stronger with emotionally appealing could have worked, particularly for a certain group of audience. If you're watching this story for the first time, then you might enjoy it, but for the other reasons you might not. Whatever, not a bad film for watching it once.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally a really good movie for a change. A movie that isn't "figured out" within the first 15 minutes. It holds the viewers attention for more than just the actors in it. The storyline is a grab and as the details roll out, twist after ohmygod twist, it holds you. I had no idea how this was going to end. Not a big fan of Nicole Kidman but she was decent in this role. I don't think of her on the caliber as Julia Roberts or Chiwetel Ejliofor are but she was decent at best. Glad to hear that Gwen Paltrow didn't get it, she would have ruined the role completely. I never thought in a million years Julia Roberts could look bad but she looked terrible in this film, and it was explained why from several different directions. She was amazing as always. Chiwetel Ejilofor carried this thriller from start to finish. He was really well casted and well played. I'll have to call this movie the sleeper of the year. Never heard a thing about it in the theaters. So much garbage is being made into movies these days, a shining star like this should have been talked up. A well known secret full of twists and yes...secrets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drama surrounding a 13-yr-old case of murder.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I saw this at home on DVD from our public library. It is an Americanized remake of sorts of a 2009 foreign film. The story presented takes place in 2002 and in 2015. It switches back and forth often. The main characters look a bit different in each period and that is the only way to recognize which year we are seeing. The technique causes minor confusion at times, but nothing critical.In 2002 a team of 3 encounter a murder, it is a body of a young girl, late teens, found in a dumpster near a Mosque. The characters attach a significance to the location, and suspect the perpetrator attends the Mosque.Another clue is a photo of a work group picnic, a young man appears to be looking in the direction of the girl later found murdered. However to me that is a very suspect clue, as you can't really tell in a 2- dimensional photo exactly where someone is looking.Still, in this story it seems that they had apprehended the murderer back in 2002 but he managed to get free. Now, 13 years later, after relentless searching databases for mug shots of criminals one of the team thinks he has found the murderer, using a different name.The movie is actually rather well made with good name actors. It is a worthwhile watch, but I suspect it is not as good as the original. I was always suspicious of the investigative methods used here.The three member team are Chiwetel Ejiofor as Ray Kasten, Nicole Kidman as Claire Sloane, and Julia Roberts as Jessica Cobb.SPOILERS: The big shock in 2002 was the dead girl was the daughter of Cobb. In present time (2015) it appears that she has not handled the 13 years well, one friend comments that "she looks one million years old." Finally Cobb tells her co-investigators "stop looking, the killer is dead, I shot him 13 years ago and he is buried in my back yard. Do what you need to do." But that didn't jive with what she had often said, being shot would be too good for him, so Kasten snoops around her home, goes to the barn in the back, and finds the killer locked up in a jail she made, he had spent 13 years never talking to anyone or touching anyone. Kasten sympathizes but knows enough is enough, he puts a handgun down and leaves the building. We hear a gunshot as the movie ends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While watching I was mostly trying to find a plot twist and marveling at the way Chiwetel Ejiofor was giving his co-actors a run for their money.Apart from the aforementioned Ejiofor and Michael Kelly, the 18 karat casts looks preposterously out of place. Especially Julia Roberts is working hard and failing even harder to look like a policewoman. And Nicole Kidman is looking great and has some sizzling chemistry with Ejiofor. But nothing she does would make you suspect she's a tough DA.The arrogant direction and non-existent scenario finish off this ill- fated production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit of a triumph of (subdued) style over substance, looking implausible overall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bring together high-calibre actors like Julia Roberts, Nicole Kidman and Chiwetel Ejiofor, add in a murder investigation, quite a bit of psychological stuff about interests pursued obsessively and then some pretty important broader thoughts about rights and blind-eye-turning in the post-September 11th USA; and surely nothing much can go wrong? And perhaps indeed not too much DOES go wrong with "Secrets in their Eyes", even more so given at least two plot twists that are worthy of the name. Nevertheless, many things don't go quite right either.Most of all, substance seems to suffer at the hands of style, as all of the aforementioned bright-spark kinds of concept - which we could even wish to see more of - in fact seem again and again to achieve their measure of interest and impact solely by forcing cops, agents and lawyers to behave in ways that you can't quite envision people out in the real world doing.It's not just that they play fast and loose with laws and procedures (let's face it, aficionados of cop movies have been in that kind of territory many, many times before); it's also that they don't even ring true in private-life terms. Ejiofor's Ray Kasten develops a thing for Kidman's Claire Sloane. She comes close to reciprocating, but keeps up her engagement, marries the other guy, and proceeds to make the latter miserable and jealous over a period of more than a decade during which Kasten is living an existence of monk-like abstinence miles away, yet also longing for her! Yet when they are reunited, and when the husband makes it clear that he's fed up of fighting the relationship that obsesses both - even though it's still never come to anything in reality - she still ends a harrowing day by leaving Kasten in the car in order that she can go back home (?!), and yet more holding-back is practised. When are these guys finally going to hit the sack? Surely, surely a scenario of this kind could not actually pertain in the real world? Without giving any more away, that is a question we are forced to ask - big time - at least a couple more times in the course of the film.There are momentary compensations, most of all a scene in which the Kidman character decides to abandon any pretence of distance from the central case, helping Kasten by wrong-footing the villain (nicely done by Joe Cole - no not the England football player!) into losing his cool, and saying and doing more than he would have otherwise chosen to do. This is a great and pretty convincing scene. Dean Norris as Bumpy Willis does more than adequately, as does the typically-satisfactory Michael Kelly as Reg Siefert, the agent whose activities in the name of a secure America set the whole problem up in the first place.Ultimately, if this film does not go quite far enough with its "America after 9/11" aspect, and if it is a little dry as a thriller (lacking much in the way of interesting settings or setups, and relying on endless flashbacks and returns to the present to achieve what it does achieve), then what we are mainly left with is an analysis of what obsession means. And here, to be fair, the film works a little better. Pretty much all of the key characters here (including also a dodgy-accented Alfred Molina as the Chief) are obsessed with their issues and fail and mess up because of them. Perhaps this message is not in fact as emphasised here as it should be, given its salutary nature. But somehow it is just about clear enough to be capable of being "taken home", and that has its value...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different in all the wrong ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems those who like this film didn't see the original first; while the rest of us were cringing with comparison.The Good: Robert's scene when she finds Carolyn in the dumpster. I stopped breathing it was so powerful. That's about it; The rest of movie never lives up to that scene. It's small differences that make the American version not sit well.First, the detective is motivated by guilt for standing Carolyn up. The Argentinean agent is not personally attached to the victim so his motivations are more pure in seeking justice for justices sake rather than atonement.Second, the original character Robert's is based on, had a very very limited role which was a good thing considering the alternative is the dead inside, passionless character Robert's ended up being.Third, I liked the justice served in the American version except that earlier in the movie Jess say's "I hate the death penalty". People who hate the death penalty and imprison a person for 13 years don't just shoot their prisoners. Fourth, and most importantly, The original is a story of love that is weighted down by murder, politics, class differences, etc... But the very last line in the original is "close the door" which gives the viewer resolution concerning the love story. The American version gives us the the love story but never reconciles the relationship between the DA and the detective. Oddly enough, the director went with an abrupt ending and ran credits right after the climax which does not typically sit well with American audiences. Love is stronger than all the negative and the American version failed to demonstrate that which left movie feeling unbalanced. I'm not a movie critic but as a consumer that is what I noticed off the bat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The secret is in the telling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Big name stars feature in a story that in the beginning seems as though it wouldn't fill out an episode of "Hawaii-Five O". However, it does have a twist or two before the end.It is a remake of an Argentinian film "El Secreto de sus Ojos", but the two versions are very different, including a gender change to one of the key characters. Billy Ray's remake, set in Los Angeles, approaches the story as a police procedural and brings the crime at the centre of the story closer to home, eliminating much of the subtext of the original, giving it a different mood altogether.Ray Kasten (Chiwetel Ejiofor) returns to a special police unit after 13-years. He reunites with the team including Claire Sloane (Nicole Kidman) who is now District Attorney, and fellow investigator Jess Cobb (Julia Roberts). Through flashbacks we realize that the team has been traumatized by the murder of Jess's daughter, and that Ray has spent the intervening years hunting for the killer. When he identifies a suspect, Jess wants revenge. Things eventually unfold in an unexpected way with an ending that has more than a touch of ambiguity.The film is rather claustrophobic in as much as not that many characters are introduced into the story, so we suspect that the perpetrator is going to be from a small number of people. Everything unfolds in a fairly straightforward manner, although the cuts from present day to the flashbacks are a little confusing. The rather flat almost pedestrian delivery seems deliberate; when the surprises come at the end, they deliver a jolt.I was amazed that the film starred heavyweight actresses Nicole Kidman and Julia Roberts ? they seem to overwhelm the story. Chiwetel Ejiofor fares best as the obsessed detective, but the relationship that develops between his character and Kidman's has little energy. The remake eliminates much of the style and pacing of the original and leaves the players a little stranded.Even the title "Secret in their Eyes" had more meaning in the original and is a major plot point, but not much is made of it here.Expectations are a lot with this film. For most of its running time it's almost as if we are waiting for the story to lift to something worthy of the star power employed ? it does to a point, but not enough to make it truly memorable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did like the movie but that's because I like Nicole Kidman, and Julia Roberts. I did not know Ejiofor as an actor at least I have not seen a lot of him to judge but he was good. They were all good but then the movie could have been a bit more poignant; it was too much like a B movie on TV were there is not enough money or time and we rush to get somewhere or we keep going on and on in circles;you pick. Also, the chemistry between some of the characters was not believable. If you want a love story between two people who are complete opposites then commit. The end was really weird I did not understand it but I did not see that coming either.So 6/10 may seem a lot but the actors were all good and that counts for something. I would have liked the suspense to be stronger and the movie to keep me interested the whole time but i was able after a while to multitask while watching the movie which I would never do if the movie was captivating. So finally all I can say is watch it it's OK but 8f you expect something thrilling and captivating then...you might be disappointed. It's an agreeable movie to watch so to speak on a rainy day but you can skip the popcorn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well acted thriller that is in desperate need of a better script.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Secret in Their Eyes is an American remake of a 2009 Argentinian film. The remake is written and directed by Billy Ray. The film stars Chewital Ejifor, Nicole Kidman, Julia Roberts and Dean Norris. The first thing that popped in my mind when watching this film was "man, this could have been damn good if this didn't happen, or if that actually happened." It was this speculative nature that made me realize that this is not a great film but it is a good one. This is a mere throw away film that you put on during a rainy Sunday. It isn't particularly well made or directed with any flare, but it is interesting enough to keep your attention. However, this is what makes viewing this as frustrating as it is because this is a film that should have been great. The cast alone sparks enough interest to see what it is about and considering the level of talent behind every aspect of this film, I expected a home run and instead I got a bunt of a film. Not to say this film is a total wash at all, it is a good thriller with great performances but the melodramatic score and uneven pacing doesn't allow the audience to sink its teeth into the film. The original film carried the weight that this film should have brought to the table and even went on to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Film in 2010. The question still remains, how the hell did this film land with the thud it does? Billy Ray is a great writer and a good director but this film has too many narrative issues and technical elements that don't match up to the standard the original set. It falls short but it is far from unwatchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The setup is pretty straightforward but open to turns and developments, eventually leading to a somewhat satisfying resolution. Since little changes from the original "El Secreto De Sus Ojos" (2009), which I watched afterwards, it's Ejiofor's rounded portrayal to make this adaptation worthwhile. He plays it with heart and good measure. While "El Secreto" paints small-town character sketches taken by quiet passions and melancholy, "Secret" makes it metropolitan, somber and tense. Also: while Kidman is still the sexy ginger fox she is, Roberts is still the most overrated Plain Jane of Cinema and a bad casting choice. For something much better of the sort, watch "Prisoners" (2013) instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't hold a candle to the Oscar winning original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Secret in Their Eyes" is a film the #OscarsSoWhite activists would probably rather you didn't see, particularly if you've already seen the Oscar winning "El secreto de sus ojos," as it contradicts many of their premises. ESDSO has very little diversity in the cast, all of whom are presumably Argentine or at least Latin American and predominantly male. SITE made a few changes to the original novel and cast to make it more diverse. Some changes work quite well. Setting the earlier events in the months immediately following 9/11 make the remake more relevant to audiences in the States; however it halves the period between present and past events, which weaken it slightly. Tweaking the final scene added to its impact. An early scene was changed significantly, presumably to cater to mid-American sensitivities. The detectives arrive at the scene of a murder. IN ESDSO, the audience has already seen the victim alive and know she is young, beautiful and vivacious. We've seen a brief flash of the victim as she is brutally attacked. Those scenes establish sympathy for the victim effectively and economically. Next we see the victim sprawled out, naked, her vacant eyes staring toward the camera. Her body is battered, bloodied and bruised, but we can still see how beautiful and sexy she used to be, and how vulnerable she was when she was killed. The detective stares for a long moment and we realize that this murder has acquired special significance.In SITE, the victim is shown in a very brief flashback, but we don't realize who she is. When the body is discovered, it's face-down in a dumpster, so even if we did remember the memory flash, we wouldn't make the connection. She's fully clothed, as if the killer took time to dress her after raping and murdering her and "bleaching the body inside and out," which seems strange and contrived. It's a crime scene, but the police haven't put up any yellow tape. The detective recognizes the victim and realizes the mother is standing nearby. We've seen the scene before, notably in Michael Mann's "Heat." We know the mother will want to rush to the body. The detective should know this. Pacino's Hanna knew it and blocked the mother from approaching or even entering the crime scene, drawing her into a compassionate embrace. The detective should have known this also. But instead of hustling the mother away from the crime scene or enlisting a couple of uniformed cops to help restrain the mother, he actually asks a first responder to step away to give the mother some room, then allows her to rush past him and contaminate the crime scene. This is after dialogue about rubber gloves. When we see the victim, she isn't cut or bruised and doesn't look as if she has been attacked. The scene has about 2% of the visual impact, makes the detective seem bumbling and incompetent and taxes the audience's willful suspension of disbelief. In the early scenes, we learn the detective has spent every free moment of the past thirteen years pouring over mug shots, searching for a suspect and has found one that doesn't really look much like the guy, but might be if he had had some rhinoplasty. The other characters don't think it's the same guy. Movies about novelists are difficult, but having the detective struggle with a novel was much more effective. The handwriting and the typewriter with the broken A were nice touches, if anachronistic. The jumps between the present and past were handled more effectively in the original. The greying of Benjamin's hair and changes in the style of his beard provide simple but effective cues to the time frame.The cast is much more diverse, recasting one of the male leads as a female, a black (played by a Brit, not an African-American) and a Hispanic (played convincingly by a British Itanian- Spaniard). The babe factor was dialed down, eliminating two walk-ons presented as little more than eye-candy and replacing the voluptuous victim with a high school student played by a twenty-one-year-old actress. None of these changes help advance the plot. ESDSO hit the ground running with a lot of conflict between the principals. SITE attempted to present them as a tightly knit group torn apart by events and circumstances. The relationships and interpersonal dynamics between the characters in ESDSO seem more real and authentic than in SITE. The unrequited love between Benjamin and Irene in ESDSO seems very real and authentic, while the analogous relationship between Ray and Claire never does. Ray holding Claire's hand as they approach a crime scene seemed forced. The way the title is reflected in the photographs is more effective in ESDSO. This was bookended in the original; if it was in the remake, I missed it. The letters in ESDSO are more effective than the comic book, as is the way the significance is revealed. Technically, SITE trumps ESDSO. Cinematography is more proficient, with far fewer jiggly- cam shots. But ESDSO has better energy and pacing. Julia Robert's fat suit didn't work at all because her face is still slender. By contrast, the stippling, balding, greying and other aging effects in the ESDSO were quite convincing. The remake has many good qualities, some of which are improvements, and is worth watching, but can't hold a candle to the original. A few of the changes to the script improved the story and made it more accessible to audiences in the United States, but some of the changes that seem to have been effected for the sake of diversity and/or to broaden its appeal weakened the story substantially.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original and remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The guy at my local CD/BlueRay rental store (and yes they still do exist)... recommended the film by Juan José Campanella staring Ricardo Darín, Soledad Villamil, &amp; Pablo Rago about a former investigator who is now writing a novel about a case that still haunts him. The case was about a rapist / murder who was found after a difficult investigation and then released because he was an asset to the intelligence service. After watching it, the next day when I returned the film, he handed me a recent American remake of the same movie by Billy Ray, staring Chiwetel Ejiofor, Nicole Kidman, and Julia Roberts. The American story is essentially the same except that the murder victim is the daughter of one of the main characters, making the pain more salient. I often dislike American remakes because they typically change the story and lose too much of what made the original worth watching. Not this time. In some ways the remake is more coherent and the character's motivation, in particular the main characters sense of guilt, is better developed. Julia Roberts in particular gave a truly phenomenal performance in the remake. I'll leave it as that as to avoid presenting spoilers for either film. Both films were well done and well worth watching.</fullReview>

The crime whilst it plays a major part in the original film is almost incidental, and whilst the whole story sort of runs along OK, the ending does not live up to that love story it is meant to be. The secret in their eyes is about the two main characters and their unspoken intense feelings for each other, not the secrets about the crime or its criminals, not even about Jesse and her secrets. Whatever you do make sure you watch the original which is absolute genius. I have seen it 4 or 5 times and its just a masterful story and a love story so intense it gets you right to the very last scene. This is a good film if it stood alone, but it can never do that because it is a remake. Quality acting is let down by the writers inability to capture what is meant to be a story about a secret love. So guys, watch the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oscars, Oscars, Everywhere...Do Not a Movie (Re)Make</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The biggest Mystery in this Movie is how an A-Lister, a Remake of an Oscar Winning Film (Best Foreign Film 2009), with two Oscar Winning Actresses on board (Nicole Kidman, Julia Roberts), a Director, Oscar Nominee Billy Ray, and an intense Leading Man (Chiwetel Ejiofor) also an Oscar Nominee, can produce such a Dull Movie. It must have taken a Minimum of Effort to make this Misfire.Nothing works. The clumsy Flashbacks bounce in and out of the Movie with nothing but a Confusing Collision with the Timeline. The Action Scenes are TV quality and are as Ordinary as they come. The Chemistry among the Cast is Strained and the Unrequited Love Angle is nothing but Unwelcome and Unbelievable.There is No Atmosphere to speak of as the Post 911 mindset of Law Enforcement of all types is Awkwardly handled and seems Misplaced and added to Spice up the Story but it too is Hum-Drum and Barely Interesting. The Twist or Shock Ending is too Little too Late and falls Flat. Nothing to Recommend with this Deadly Dud. Maybe Stargazers can locate something of Interest. Others can Miss this Misstep without Missing Much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of Secret in Their Eyes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dean Norris has been a working actor for over thirty years. He's not lousy with his craft but when he's in front of the camera, it feels an awful lot like direct-to-video territory. Case in point: Secret in Their Eyes (my latest review) co-stars Norris and highlights Academy Award winner Julia Roberts plus recent nominee Chiwetel Ejiofor. As a remake of 2009's Argentine film with the identical title, "Eyes" is something for the Lifetime channel, a reheated vehicle throwing in two ending twists just for the sheer heck of it. Imagine Zodiac and Mystic River posing as TV movies trimmed down with just enough commercials to fill the two-hour mark. That's the essence of "Eyes" with its systematic grandstanding posing as controlled, Oscar bait.Based on a novel, produced by Mark Johnson (Rain Man, The Alamo, The Notebook), and featuring every trouper aching to give the performance of the century, Secret in Their Eyes doesn't quite have the scope or production values to garner end-of-the-year awards consideration. That doesn't stop it from taking things way too seriously. The story begins by chronicling FBI investigator Jess Cobb (Julia Roberts). It's just a typical day at the bureau where agents shaken up by the 9/11 tragedy, are on the lookout for relegated, terrorist activity. When Jess and her close-knit partner (Ray Kasten played by Chiwetel Ejiofor) are called over to check out a murder scene (a dead body lies in a dumpster somewhere near FBI headquarters), the victim turns out to be Cobb's teenage daughter (Zoe Graham as Carolyn Cobb). Ejiofor's Ray somehow feels responsible for her death (the film explains why very briefly) and becomes obsessed with finding the killer. He veers from his spy-catching duties and turns into a homicide detective by spending many years on the Internet (looking for pictures of every criminal in the U.S.). In terms of additional casting, Nicole Kidman (Claire Sloan) plays a District Attorney supervisor to Cobb and Kasten. Also, the chameleon-like Alfred Molina does great supporting work as Kidman's persona's principal.Now during the majority of Secret in Their Eyes, scenes cut back and forth between the years 2002 and present day. The film does this so often and so unnecessarily, I wouldn't know what time period it was had it not been for a few gray hairs on beards and a side character going completely bald. I read somewhere that a critic deemed this thirteen-year flashback fest as causing "Eyes" to constantly lose its tension. I wouldn't say that's the case. However, the hook featured is more of a gimmick than anything else. If I was in charge of editing, I would just shoot the whole darn thing chronologically. It's the same narrative anyway you look at it.Overall, I don't think of Secret in Their Eyes as a bad film. I mean, I didn't pick up on its gotcha endings and the caliber of acting is at most, adequate (the role Julia Roberts plays isn't much of a stretch for her and Chiwetel Ejiofor emotes to the point where it's overblown). In fact, I'm actually praising "Eyes" for its ability to make you wanna watch it again the minute the credits roll (I started to make a small, mental checklist in my head of all the previous sequences that occurred). Its look and feel however, well that's a different story. What's on screen makes for a conventional, wonted viewing experience. In a sense, director Billy Ray isn't really shooting for the stars. It's more like he's auditioning for an extended contract on USA network. Rating: 2 and a half stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>..Bland but watchable remake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i have seen the original and now this. this was watchable..but watchable is not acceptable with such a star-studded cast. Julia Roberts..i noticed lots of reviewers wrote about how good her acting and how brave to be w/o make-up. who cares that she went w/o make- up?...Roberts acting was like a roller-coaster ride...up and down...at times it was fairly good and at times i wanted to laugh at her. i don't think shes meant for these type of roles and i like her very much. Nicole Kidman was totally miscasted and an even bigger offender..and again..shes one of my favorite actresses. the only main lead who was consistent was Ejiofor..but its not his best work. the original movie made you feel...the characters in the original were so alive..be they bad or good. this remake made you feel blasé...who cares. one of the most important things the remake couldn't hit on was the ache the passion and the longing to be with each other the 2 main leads felt for each other.you could feel that in the original..so...a big miss on Kidmans part..again..totally miscasted. you also couldn't feel the evil of the perpetrator..a bland villain in the remake...the villain in the original was actually scary. this could have been a really really good movie also..but i think i know why it wasn't. blame can be put on the director also...if the takes aren't done right..for goodness sake..keep redoing the takes til its got the right feel. but i think most of the money went to the big name stars so there was probably monetary constraints on the movie..which leads to time constraints..meaning..not enough time to get the takes right. i don't think this movie had unlimited funding..it doesn't even list its budget on here at IMDb...most movies do. so...with limited funding and such a big name cast the film just ran out of time and money. what a shame...it could have been really really good. but don't get me wrong...its still a watchable thriller..it just pales in comparison to the original. thats whats so funny about it...the original probably had 1/20 the budget of this movie an was almost a perfect movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Thrills Here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was inspired by the Oscar winning film from Argentina; sadly, it didn't get enough to produce a decent film, even with the first rate cast that included Kidman and Roberts, both of which are wasted in this tepid film that barely manages to reach its surprising conclusion.We get to see how the lives of three law officers are ruined by the murder of one young woman. Through various twists and turns, the criminal avoids prison time, and it devastates Roberts because she doesn't believe there would be a big enough punishment for the killer, and he's now free. In the middle of this tragedy, another one unfolds as two lovers are unable to come together because there's too much interference and misunderstanding as one pursues a successful career and the other one is obsessed with solving her friend's case..The problem with "Secret" is that the film that inspired this slow, undercooked, and overstuffed movie was beautifully told. We followed the development of events and couldn't be more shocked and satisfied with the eventual resolution. In this new movie, we're exhausted and disappointed as the secondary plot line detracts from the main story. It could have worked in the hands of a better director. It's not the case here.There is a problem with the way it's edited, and the revelations in the flashbacks don't clarify events. There are moments when one doesn't even know which time period one is looking at. Other than some Grey hairs on one of the detectives, everyone looks pretty much the same. Julia's character hasn't changed her drab appearance, and Nicole's outfits got a little better, but she's still a stunner. This is one secret they should have kept to themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The secret is out..."Secret in Their Eyes" could have been so much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood loves to remake foreign language films and it's at it again with an Argentinian film that was made only six years ago. The Secret in Their Eyes received the Best Foreign Language Oscar but there's no chance for this production to be even nominated in any Oscar categories. I haven't seen the original so I can't compare the two movies but knowing Hollywood's track record with remakes, the Argentinian version would have been a superior production.In 2002, a team of FBI investigators including Ray (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Jess (Julia Roberts) along with a newly arrived district attorney, Claire (Nicole Kidman), are based in Los Angeles to prevent terrorists from inflicting more damage to the American way of life after 9/11 the previous year. The agency receives a call about an incident that has taken place in the vicinity of a mosque. Thinking this is terror-related they make the grim discovery of a murdered young lady who just so happens to be Jess' daughter, Carolyn (Zoe Graham). The agents make an arrest but the man is released as he is a snitch for the FBI, providing names of terrorists to the organization. For 13 years, Ray logs onto the criminal database and eventually finds the man who might have been responsible for Carolyn's death. Will justice be served after 13 years?The main problem with the story is the ridiculous number of flashbacks throughout the whole film. There are even flashbacks within flashbacks. The flow of the narrative is constantly interrupted and there are occasions where you have to think when the story is being set. As for the story itself, it is rather lacking in thrills which takes away the dramatic impact of the whole situation. This is rarely edge&nbsp;of your seat material which is a shame as the story should lend&nbsp;itself to a tense and dramatic thriller.&nbsp;What the story does well is provide character interactions and depict why people act and behave the way they do. If you are after a character study then you will be happier with the development of the story. For characterizations to excel you need actors who you can empathize with. Ejiofor is the main star and he performs with distinction while Roberts doesn't have as many scenes but she is excellent in conveying her emotions. Kidman is overshadowed by her counterparts but still manages to bring her character to life. Dean Norris as FBI agent Bumpy Willis brings some humor to his role, ensuring that the tone of the story isn't dour for the whole film. Alfred Molina has several scene- stealing scenes as District Attorney Martin Morales.A movie with two Oscar winning actresses and an Oscar nominated actor should have been better than this. Here is a definite case of the trailer being more exciting than the film itself. The final product only provides a fraction of what the intriguing premise had to offer.&nbsp; http://mlaimlai2.wix.com/magical-movie-review</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dream Cast Fails To Elevate The Film Into Greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Julia Roberts and Nicole Kidman have yet to appear together in a film and this remake of the Argentinian thriller entitled "Secret In Their Eyes" provides us that treat of having the two of these Academy Award winning actresses star in it.Together with Chiwetel Ejiofor,they all star in a thriller about a team of rising investigators - FBI counter-terrorism investigator Ray Kasten, district attorney's investigator Jess Cobb, and District Attorney Claire Sloan - whose relationship are torn apart after the daughter - Carolyn Cobb - of one of its member - Jess - was found murdered.The screenplay also written by director Billy Ray spans thirteen years wherein Ray left the badge and became passionate in solving the case and the rise of Claire from being a DA assistant to her current position and Jess from becoming an investigator to the DA's chief investigator.Added to that, we also get to witness Ray's obsession of locating the primary suspect Marzin in order to find closure to the case which apparently is different from the direction that Claire's office is headed;the pain and suffering of Jess upon losing her daughter; and the attraction between Claire and Ray.No question that it had a wonderful,astonishing and surprising ending wherein Claire,Ray and Jess are able to resolve their differences after Jess admits killing Marzin and later Ray prove otherwise after finding Marzin locked up in the cage by Jess in her home at Moorpark instead for the past 13 years.But the conclusion nor the dream cast are not enough to elevate this film into greatness considering that the film was somewhat boring in the middle part for nothing much happens as the viewer is subjected too much on Ray's passion for searching Marzin and the psychological impact it has had on him with no little or no development happening at the story told back and forth progresses but it will only be brought to an end at the conclusion of the film.Added to that,nothing really happens much in the attraction between Ray and Claire expect that we are treated to a "what if" romance and nothing more.Also,it failed to focus on what message it wants to portray particularly about the justice and legal system in the country particularly the life sentence and the death penalty.The performances of the cast were absolutely delightful but the comparison it will make to the Argentinian original will definitely be unfair considering it definitely is not at par with it.In the end,one would conclude that American remake missed an opportunity of becoming a great film just like the original.</fullReview>

It is a slow moving movie with some strange picks for actress hairstyles and dress. But, the acting is fine, the camera work is fine, and the movie works.If you view it, try not to have seen the original or at least judge it on its merits than what it does not do that the original did. Too many art house critics have weighed in unfairly on this movie.Do not expect a lot of blood or violence. It is not a real action movie, but it is about a parent's loss of a child and the efforts of someone that carries quilt and love to sort out the truth.</fullReview>

If Ray and Jessica were so close they wouldn't have held back all of those secrets.How Bumpy hurt his leg is just ridiculous. That would've never happened.Seifert's death was Jessica's fault because of her secret. If he really torched the van, why would he have even been called for back-up any way.Didn't like the ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First let me preface by saying I have a BA in cinema my mother is from Mexico my father is from Costa Rica my mother's ex-boyfriend is Chilean, my father lives and I lived many years in Venezuela. I am very enriched in Latin culture and then includes film. That being said I saw the original many years ago and I'm still traumatized by the sexuality and violence of it. I don't like to think of myself as a prude but our culture tends to go to far for shock value. I really liked the changes to the film and the dynamic from a husband and wife to a mother and daughter. I like that we didn't have to see what happened to her daughter ( always thought that was unnecessary in the original ) for me what is most important about this film working is keeping the shocking ending and they do and even take it a step further. Saw this film tonight with my mother and aunt and they all agreed it was better than the original. It was much classier, with wonderful performances from dependable actors. Definitely recommended must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very strong ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells the story of four policemen, who reunite after thirteen years in order to solve the new clues that could uncover the murderer of one of their daughters.I watched the original a few years ago, before the results of the Oscars were announced. I remember I was completely blown away by the powerful and emotional plot. From the beginning, middle and the end, the whole plot was very strong.In this remake, the ending is powerful but the way getting there is a bit less powerful. I like Nicole Kidman who is still as graceful as ever, and this time she even puts on a lot of frowns that wrinkles her forehead. She stars in a lot of dramas lately, and I like all of them. Julia Roberts is unrecognisable in here, she is pale and thin and weathered, which fits her role but it is not what people picture her to be! The reason for the lack of support for reopening the case is not so strong in this film, which explains why it resonates with me less. However, the ending is still very powerful and leaves me almost paralysed with emotions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Welcome to the war." Jess (Roberts) is a detective who, along with Ray (Ejiofor) are investigating a series of murders. When Jess's daughter becomes on of the victims everyone's lives are affected. 13 years later Ray thinks he has finally found the murderer. When the case is reopened it once again affects the lives of all involved. This is a movie I was looking forward to. The cast is great and the idea is very interesting. I sat down to watch this with high expectations. I will say the movie is very good and worth seeing, but I was a little disappointed. There was just something missing in this to really grip me. Julia Roberts' acting in this is incredible and one of the best performances I have seen by her but I really didn't feel a connection to this movie for some reason. On the other hand the ending was great and really saved the movie a little. Overall, I had a high expectations for this movie and that may have been why I was a little disappointed. The movie is very good and worth seeing, but my expectations may have been a little high, and it was missing that extra something to really make me emotionally involved. I give this a disappointing B-.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great film with tons of mistakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>for once, i agree with my fellow reviewers;Secrets is full of good stuff, Julia Roberts is fantastic (in some scenes, and not so much in some others, due to how much her character changes halfway through the film), Chiwetel Ejiofor does a great job, Nicole Kidman does the same thing she does in every film she's ever been in, and even the production is great.But unfortunately, as Yahtzee says, this film flows like a river of bricks. The pacing is terrible, there's these great scenes, moods, emotions, and then large chunks of nothing, taking you out of the film entirely. It's a shame, because i loved about half of this film. When something happens, it's masterfully done, but the other half of the film should have been cut out and left on the cutting room floor.note that i did not see the original and i am valuing this film exclusively on its own merits.I would still recommend Secret In Their Eyes, but my advice is, you will come out thinking this could have been so much better; imho, a solid rewrite based on Julia Roberts could have won her an Oscar.My vote: 7/10 - so much good stuff, watered down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A middle of the road remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people write American remakes off before they've even seen them. The reason for this I don't know. Possible there's just been too many poorly done ones in the past, or perhaps people who enjoy foreign versions of things aren't as inclined to enjoy American cinema. I absolutely loved the original 'Oldboy' and was personally delighted when I heard they were doing an American remake. And to me it was a very good film which stayed true to the original while putting its own unique style on it at the same time. However try telling the die-hard fans of the original that the remake is good and they'll lynch you. I can't help but wonder how much of this type of opinion has gone into 'The Secret in Their Eyes', or are people just seeing it for what it really is - a subpar movie.I'd neither seen, nor even heard of the original version before seeing this one so I went in with no preconceived notions or ideas of how the story would play out. It was admittedly a little slow, there isn't a great deal of action sequences and those that there are are brief and pretty forgettable. It's a dialogue driven movie, which is fine, only to pull that off the dialogue has to be snappy and clever. It often lacks both of these things. The story itself is interesting enough to pull it through though and the star power of Julie Roberts, Nicole Kidman and Chiwetel Ejiofor is enough to cover up a lot of the faults.However, you can tell the movie is depending a lot on its "twist" to win viewers over. It's basically saying, "OK we know the first hour and a half has been a bit messy and forgettable, but here's this, forgive us now?" Unfortunately I don't think it was quite enough to make up for most of it. I suspect had this been a lower budget movie that couldn't afford the fine actors it did get on board it would be in real trouble right now because as a film alone it wasn't strong enough to stand on its own two legs. As someone who really likes to see films get the "American" treatment, I hope this film hasn't damaged the hopes of future remakes being done. It shouldn't have. It's not harming anyone, it's just not overly great.</fullReview>

I shudder to think who may watch this film and come away with a justification for vigilante vengeance. I don't want to spoil the ending, but it elicits sympathy for characters who do some terrible things. No matter how terrible a crime, retribution on the same scale can never be justified in my view. This film is a depressing indictment of the criminal justice system which also feeds into racist hatred of Muslims.

		<fullReview>"Passion always wins, right?" Uh, no. The point of Secret in their Eyes is rather the mortal cost of passions irrationally pursued.The plot's trigger is a young loser's sudden passion for a blonde beauty that leads to his raping and killing her. It erupts again when he's taunted by the beautiful lawyer Claire (Nicole Kidman). The killer is freed because he's a snitch serving the police as an insider in a suspicious mosque. The passionate fear after 9/11 leads to the cops' suspension of the law, sense and responsibility. The second layer of misspent passion is the two characters' determination to correct that injustice. Ray (Chiwetel Ejiofor) quits the force to work in civilian security ? protecting the hapless Mets ? but spends 13 years of evenings checking through files of criminal faces to find that killer. The murdered girl's detective mother Jess (Julia Roberts) seems to share that determination to find the killer. But we ultimately learn she already has him. She has kept him in a shed for those 13 years, preferring thus to give him a life sentence rather than the release of execution. But as Ray points out, she has been serving that life sentence with him, as his restricted jailer. Ray's colleague Bumpy still has the limp caused by his chase of the killer. "What limp?" he asks, wielding his cane, in a comic parallel to Jess and Ray crippling themselves by their obsession.Ray is paralyzed by another passion, his unexpressed love for his former colleague, now DA, Claire. He left his "great" wife "Because she wasn't you." Now, 13 years later, Claire's husband Ellis reveals he has always known she loved Ray not him. Her "We blew it" refers to the unrealized love between Claire and Ray, as well as their case against the killer.So some passions lose because they're not followed up, as Ray failed to ask out Claire because she was engaged. "We understand each other" is her description of her marriage, a pale consolation for a failed ardor. As Ray is played by the black Ejiofor his color provides another reason for his failure to have approached her. Her boss warns the community college grad against presuming to the Harvard whiz, but the racial divide was another unspoken barrier between them. But the main losers from passion are the obsessives who can't let go and can't modulate their driving forces. Claire rises through the ranks because of her determination. She's always in control, careful to avoid excess. We see that when she exposes the killer by seeming to release him. Jess and Ray have the discipline of control and the determination to find justice ? noble imperatives both ? but step over the line into obsession, into the irrationality that diminishes their lives.The title comes from the source Argentinian film. The opening shot establishes eyes digging for a secret in files and files of mug shots. Ray's secret is his search, Jess's her successful vengeance and Claire's her drive to power. People may advance a very firm image but their essential secret lies in their eyes. And lies and lies and lies. All this psychodrama plays against a specific political context. The early scenes occur in the wake of 9/11, when America was driven by fears of Muslim terrorists and the rumour of sleeper cells about to erupt. The later are now, when our remains full of fear. The passion to fight that threat at whatever cost, to the point of destroying the values we are supposedly defending, is the national parallel to the personal passions exposed here as paralyzing and destructive. Mania in pursuit of our values is still mania. As the police boss Morales (an ironic name if there ever was one) and bad cop Siefert betray their office and justice, they embody the nation's temptation to compromise its essential values for the putative purpose of defending them. Winning that way is really losing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Julia Roberts is back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An English-language remake of Juan José Campanella's, I think superior Argentinian thriller. The film is intense in its attempts to marry the personal and the political, and not only does it have an amazing cast, but the director knows how to use them effectively. Each one of them brings credibility to their characters. But it's Julia Roberts who owns the movie, as the grieving Jess. Overall, this remake fails to add something new to a film that did't even need a remake to begin with. It never quite captures the intensity of the film it is based upon, making it a common thriller. Sometimes you even think that you are watching an episode of "Law &amp; Order.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story takes place switching back and forth between two time periods. In 2002, Ray Kasten (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Jessica Cobb (Julia Roberts) are investigators in L.A. Claire Sloane (Nicole Kidman) is the new lawyer in the D.A.'s office. D.A. Martin Morales (Alfred Molina) is obsessed with uncovering a plot in a mosque under investigation. Jessica's murdered daughter Carolyn is found near the mosque. Ray quickly zeroes in on car thief Marzin who turns out to be the confidential informer inside the mosque. Ray finds Morales blocking his effort. Thirty years after the case somehow got buried, Ray returns claiming to have found Marzin by visually checking each inmate and that Marzin has just recently let out of prison. He asks Claire who is now the D.A. to reopen the case.This is an adaptation of an Argentinian Oscar winner. Most criticism seems to indicate that this is too much the same as the original. While I cannot forget the memorable ending of the original, I think it's a mistake to punish this movie for repeating it. There are also plenty of changes from the original. The addition of the 9/11 paranoia is very compelling and logical. Putting Julia Roberts inside the investigation has the advantage of showcasing her in a strip-down unglamorous performance. This movie has great actors doing good work. I would like more compelling evidence against Marzin during the original investigation. The interrogation results in him blurting out "what she got" but that's not really enough. He needs to lay out the whole case for it to be convincing. Some may prefer more ambivalence in his guilt but I think this movie needs it to be more decisive. There are also convenient moments like Ray catching Marzin in a Dodgers game. The story is not perfect but I really like the actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 90s called...they want their thriller back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has a helluva lot going for it; Stella cast and superb production values. Unfortunately, it suffers from a screenplay that never grounds you anywhere. It's difficult to align yourself with someone who has disappeared for 13 years. (You just did internet searches that whole time? Really?) If Chiwetel Ejiofor's character is our man then we want to know who he is. Like many a dull screenplay, there's no significant action (that tells us why we'll want to watch this story) prior to the plot kicking in....The film left me with a few thoughts...how brave it was for Julia Roberts to look so dowdy and how Nicole Kidman can actually be okay when she plays herself (being a flirty muse). It's still an enjoyable ride, the cinematography is suitably atmospheric (Julia Robert's husband is the DP), as is the music by Emilio Kauderer. It's just a pity the screenplay didn't get the work it needed to keep you interested.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And what secret would that be?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Secret in Their Eyes is a remake of a well drawn out Argentinian film known as El secreto de sus ojos, so a lack of originality is apparent, but only to those who're aware of it. There's no happy-go-luck tune here; a dark, slow ambiance fits the plot, as ex- FBI agent Ray Kasten (Chiwetel Ejiofor) believes he's found the killer to a close work- friend's daughter. Julia Roberts is sensational as the grieving parent, her expressions more powerful than any dialogue written. SiTE could do with some fining on the editing front, as two timelines (the events after the murder/present day investigation) are a little muddled. As the pieces start to add up (Kidman and Ejiofor's romance however, does not) the endgame is clear but fails to peak when crime/thrillers should. Roberts and Ejiofor unequivocally make SiTE worth watching for their raw performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original versions are almost always better then remakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you never saw El secreto de sus ojos from Juan José Campanella then I guess you could watch Secret in Their Eyes. But then just because it's in English and easier for people that don't understand Spanish or are too lazy to read subtitles. But that should be the only reason because the original is just better. Why they have to make a remake of a movie I will never get. There are so many good books or stories you could chose from to make a good movie so I don't get why you would make a remake of an already very good movie. It's just a waste of time and money. Nevertheless Secret in Their Eyes is a good movie but like I said almost completely the same as the Argentinian version. There are only a couple changes in the movie because this one is based in Los Angeles. The actors are good and the directing is also good. Nothing to complain about. I saw both of them so I exactly knew what was coming in the American version. So I couldn't get surprised by the twists and that's a pity. So if you asked me to chose between the Argentinian or the American version my answer would be very easy. Watch the original one because remakes are almost never better then the originals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>6.5 of 10. While this didn't live up to the 2009 original by the same name, it's definitely not a bad film. The 2009 film wasn't super either despite getting the award for best foreign language film. Both films are worth seeing and both, despite the similarities, are different enough that they could be watched simultaneously without losing interest.The dangerous combination of obsession and power is the main focus here. Although it's more complicated than a film about how a person given a hammer starts viewing everything as a nail or how "the road to hell is paved with good intentions", the allegory as a whole is similar to the combination.Where the direction and the stars get in the way involve some excess acting that results in melodramatic, cliché scenes and the length of the film (not horrifically too long, but too long in some parts, too short in others, and more cuts to the version as it is would help).While there are a lot of eye related shots and focus on the characters' eyes, it's not enough that this should be the title for either film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SECRET IN THEIR EYES (2015) ** Chiwetel Ejiofor, Nicole Kidman, Julia Roberts, Dean Norris, Joe Cole, Michael Kelly, Zoe Graham. Frankly a dull bore adaptation of the Argentenian film 'El Secreto de Sus Ojos' involving a team of federal investigators embroiled in a years on end search for a killer of one of their own daughters that plays more like a Law &amp; Order procedural than a big-screen drama. The ping-ponging back and forth of the 14 year time frame is maddening to say the least. The principals all seem bored with zero chemistry between them and the sluggish direction by Billy Ray (who also adapted the screenplay) only leadens down the production into a grand melaise of 'meh' at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cast in a great plot movie that is unfortunately isn't as good as it's premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Secret in Their Eyes" (2015) has two Oscar winners and one nominee in it's leading roles. It is based on a (probably) great movie "El secreto de sus ojos" which is always in IMDb Top 250 (and which i surely plan to see in upcoming couple of months), features a very descent plot and acting is actually good in this movie, so why "Secret in Their Eyes" isn't a superb flick? Because of not involving script and kinda lazy directing. I liked the overall idea of this movie, i also kinda liked the outcome, but it wasn't really engaging story, nor it was really involving or very interestingly shown to us. Overall, acting in this movie is quite good. It was kinda interesting to see Nicole Kidman playing not some kind of well known person in a poor movie (as she does them a lot recently), and she was well... interesting in this movie, not quite sure was this an OK performance or a bad one yet. Julia Roberts had the best performance in this movie in my opinion, the most difficult one and she did a great job, while Chiwetel Ejiofor was reliable as usual and Dean Norris was just another reincarnation of Hank Schrader - i miss that guy. While the movie itself wasn't bad at all, it wasn't very involving or engaging. More tight script could have been better for this movie, because it tried to many things and fail to achieve one thing - be one of the main ingredients of a great movie. "Secret in Their Eyes" (2015) unfortunately isn't one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did NOT see that twist coming! (although they do drop clues during the movie). This one came and went without much fanfare, but I wanted to see it due to the A-list cast. Julia Roberts, Nicole Kidman, Chiwetel Ejiofor. A stellar cast that managed to take a so-so movie and make it worth the watch. At it's heart, this is a movie about Regret. Regret for actions not taken. For words not spoken, for things you wished you had done differently. The story unfolds but going back and forth 15yrs, from an event that tears a team apart to the impact its had on their lives as they search for justice, each in their own way. Like I said, the performances sell this movie more than anything else. I honestly thought the plot was a bit weak and the 'villain' was pathetic. The idea that he was untouchable due to bureaucratic dealings was maddening and you could understand how easy it could be to cross the line between Justice and Vigilantism. The cons. Well the movie is slow paced (it didn't bother me but some may call it boring). There also isn't much of Julia and considering the pivotal role she plays, that seems wrong. On the other hand, the focus is placed on Ejiofor's character and he's always magnetic to watch. His chemistry with Nicole Kidman was also on point and every time they were on screen together, I was waiting for sparks to fly.If you like thrillers, mixed with a little drama and an ending with a helluva payoff (it's all about the facial expressions in those last minutes) I highly recommend checking out Secret in Their Eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>4 Feb 2016: A great movie with some good twists and turns. Julia Roberts is Always great in any role that she plays. Julia, Meryl Streep, Susan Sarandon and Angela Bassett are my favorite actresses. I liked this movie from start to finish. I never saw the Spanish version of which this movie was based on. Chiwetel is good in all of his roles too. I am not a big Nicole Kidman fan, but she has done some good roles and she is cute too. I first remember seeing Nicole years ago in a movie titled "Dead Calm" in 1989.Very good surprise twist when Julia's {Jess} confesses at home to Ray and Claire that she killed him 13 years ago. I was thinking that it would end in a couple of minutes only to find that she did not kill him, but had him locked up in a self made prison in her home far out in the country where no one can hear him scream. Hum, I wondered after all the years she kept him alive, did she allow him to wash himself up, change his clothes once in a while otherwise he would stink so bad that she would not be able to stay near him.I liked tension and sexual chemistry between Chiwetel Ejiofor {Ray} and Nicole Kidman {Claire}. You really knew that Ray had serious feelings for her after he nearly beats the suspect into a FUBAR. Alfred Molina's {Martin} tells Ray that Harvard law don't date junior college, {great line}. It would have been great to see Martin walk in and find Ray and Claire in a romantic compromise which would have made Martin bitter and envious. That would have shut Martin's big mouth with the quickness. It was disappointing that every time Ray and Claire were in a romantic scene there was an interruption by a cell phone or something to prevent the obvious attraction between them. After they held hands in the car, they should have kissed at least once to seal the deal between them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I went to the cinema without knowing any details about "Secret in Their Eyes", let alone that it was a remake. My initial thoughts towards this picture was that I was seeing a confusing film, given that a lot of times I couldn't realize if the scene was happening or being remembered from the past; therefore, I really think filmmakers have gone wrong whilst editing such aspects of the movie. However, the story as a whole, is simply GENIAL. Jess is a police officer whose daughter has been strangely murdered, so all the plot is related to the consequences such crime has brought to Jess and to her friends in the police. There are GREAT performances throughout the mystery, mainly from Julia Roberts and Joe Cole. But, in fact, what really surprised me was the great twist that my date and me could never see coming; we left the cinema open-mouthed due to the revelation of Jess' real behavior, which was brilliantly written. All in all, ignoring all the controversy involving "is it as good the original or not?", I must say that "Secret in Their Eyes" is just a GREAT movie that deserves to be much more recognized than it currently is.</fullReview>

The whole point of SECRET IN THEIR EYES is that since 9-11, many if not most folks in the American Law Enforcement community are running their Own Private Guantanamos in their backyards. Corrections officials bring some of their work home with them, prosecutors practice persecution in privatized pens, and patrol people operate cop shops next to their woodsheds. Sometimes a segment of The Thin Blue Line gets too sloppy, leaving multiple late wives clogging local waterways in barrels, like Officer Peterson of Chicago, and they're publicly reprimanded. More often, their SECRETs remain only IN THEIR EYES, as they function as the self-appointed judge, jury, and eventual executioner at their compounds in the Boondocks.

		<shortDescription>Above average whodunit flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 2010, Argentinian thriller El Secreto de Sus Ojos beat out Michael Haneke's brilliant The White Ribbon and French gem A Prophet for the Best Foreign Film Academy Award. That's how damn impressive it is. So it's not surprising that it eventually was given the Hollywood makeover. The question is does this star-studded, LA-based remake separate itself from the original and carve out its own place in the crowded crime genre? Sort of, but not really. But kind of. The backdrop has adjusted from Argentina's Dirty Wars to the more familiar War on Terror, planting this update into a messy and uneasy political landscape that creates a suitably tense and morally ambiguous atmosphere for the movie. The details of the grisly case at the film's core have gone relatively unchanged though, which is a shame for those who've seen the original, but should rivet newcomers with its gut-punching twists that span a 13-year time period. As the tormented investigator with a personal link to the victim, Chiwetel Ejiofor owns every second of screen time he's given with his commanding presence, whilst Julia Roberts is emotionally raw as the grieving mother with FBI resources at her disposal. Unfortunately Nicole Kidman drops the ball as the cautious but realistic State's attorney who holds a flame for ex-co-worker Ejiofor, never fully convincing in a steely role that requires more grit than what Kidman can produce. Shot and scored with the sombre mood you would expect, and wisely kept to a taut sub-two-hour runtime, Secret in Their Eyes fails to better (or even match) its forerunner yet elevates itself above the standard whodunit fare with two powerhouse performances and an absorbing central murder case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good murder mystery with a lot of interesting twist and turns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chiwetel Ejiofor was really good. His performance here mimics his performance in Z for Zachary. Both movies have dark themes, with Secret in Their Eyes being about trying to convict a murderer for the rape and murder of a young woman after the case is 15 years cold, when he slips through their fingers the first time. Ejiofor plays Ray, an FBI agent determined to find the killer, and he plays it dark with touches of light humor, that allows us to like the character more, even as he juggles his obsession with the case with his attraction to the new DA, Claire played by Nicole Kidman. The relationship between Ray and Claire was done well and made it interesting to watch. Ejiofor also showcases this balance as he investigates the case with Bumpy Willis, played by Dean Norris of Breaking Bad fame.Julia Roberts gave a great performance in the film as the mother whose daughter was murdered and also happens to be a fellow FBI investigator. She seem unafraid to glam it down in order to fully get into the character of a grieving mother.I understand that Secret in Their Eyes was adapted from a foreign film, but without seeing that film, I thought the overall experience of watching this film was great. It's a good look about what obsession and the need fro redemption can do to you and it was filled with a lot of twist and turns that keep you guessing, like a good murder mystery should.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Writer/director Billy Ray assumed a threatening role when he set about to re-write and direct the superb Argentine film "El secreto de sus ojos" ? the tense script by Juan José Campanella and Eduardo Sacheri - and though the stories do not compare, the film is a strong one, largely due to a cast and cinematographer that would be difficult to improve.2002: Ray Kasten (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Jess Cooper (Julia Roberts) are two investigators in a private police unit led by the DA. When they receive an anonymous tip about a girl raped and killed, they rush to the scene. Ray realizes it is Jess' daughter and the team falls apart due to the grief. In 2015, Ray comes back to LA, and says that after 13 years, he has found a lead and convinces the DA Claire (Nicole Kidman) to reopen the case. They find clues and leads unknown to them, and secrets from the past come to light as they start discovering the real, chilling truth. Meanwhile, Jess, dissatisfied with the law, decides to take matters into her own hands and track down the killer, no matter what lengths she must go to merit her vengeance.The supportive cast is outstanding ? Michael Kelly as a detective on the team, Alfred Molina as a corrupt cop who prefers focus on discovering terrorists to aiding in the investigation of the death of Jess' daughter (Zoe Graham), Joe Cole as the police snitch in the terrorism hunt, and others. The bouncing around the time frames becomes a bit disconcerting at times (the only way to gage the different years of the story is by the color of Eijiofor's hair!) It is rather amazing that some of these actors did not win Oscar nominations??.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Crime thrillers are quite often my favorite genre of film to go see. There's something about them that has always appealed to me. So it's safe to say I was looking forward to how Secret in Their Eyes would turn out. I was actually unaware that the film was a remake, and from what I hear, the original is a lot better. That's usually the case with remakes but once in awhile we get a film like The Departed, which is one of the greatest remakes of all time. Secret in Their Eyes unfortunately fell a bit flat to me.The cast is great. Nicole Kidman, Julia Roberts, and Chiwetel Ejiofor all give formidable performances, specifically Ejiofor. He's becoming one of the most underrated actors working today. He always brings his A-game and this film is no different. It's just that the film around these characters doesn't mesh as well as I would have preferred. The three are a team of investigators trying to take down the man who raped and killed Jess's daughter. Jess is played by Roberts and though she seemed to be the center focus of the marketing, she's very much a supporting character in the film. That brings me to my main gripe with the film, Kidman and Ejiofor share a side story where it's strongly hinted and somewhat revealed that they have a romantic history. I'm fine with romance if it works within the context of the story. I legitimately couldn't find a good reason for this to be in the film at all. Their chemistry is fine, in fact I can buy that these characters would work romantically, it just doesn't fit within the story they were telling.The film is told in a series of flashbacks as well as the present time moving forward. At first, I found it unnecessary and difficult to decipher which was which unless I looked at the slightest hair style differences. But after awhile I grew to appreciate that way of telling this specific story. With that said, the romance does continue to interrupt the increasingly interesting crime drama. But I also don't even think the actual investigation was as intriguing as it probably should have been. Plus, the way the film closes felt like a far stretch, especially considering how realistic the rest of the film was. So in all, Secret in Their Eyes isn't a bad film, it just ultimately ended up being a forgettable one.+Ejiofor+Flashbacks prove effective-Story never popped-Romance5.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The stars do their best to keep the drama intact, but presentation of the thriller feels redundant and the mystery angle barely produces any excitement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the first five minutes, Secret in Their Eyes already delivers several famous faces. It's apparent that the movie invests heavily on the cast, and while they are capable, the investigation story is rather bland and barely able to draw any emotional depth. I'm well aware that it's a remake, but it shouldn't be an issue or affect it in major way, considering that the movie is of average quality regardless.The story might seem complicated at first with the many time jumps it presents, however it's practically the same case of homicide spanning for 13 years, with minute details sprinkled here and there. The daughter of a counter-terrorist agent is murdered, the team then pursues this case with two different agendas, one is justice for the daughter and the advancement of terrorist prevention.Despite having the backdrop of murder, terrorism and rape at the same time, the case isn't complex. It's barely the level of good television drama as the investigation is pretty fundamental and offers little shocking twist. The two timelines are quite refined as audience can easily follow the pace, albeit the repeat story angle does feel cumbersome.This might be an analogy of wallowing on the past, say that it is, that doesn't change the monotonous tone as well as occasional far-fetch development. Fortunately, the cast holds its own. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Ray is the main agent, working on the case at both time perspectives, he appears determined almost to a fault. The focus of his character is more towards drama, especially between him and his colleagues, than endearing cop procedural.Nicole Kidman as Claire is the calmer prosecutor type, she's the love interest role on the subplot while also having some part on the case. She looks good, amazingly for older and younger version alike, a bit of resemblance to her role in The Interpreter. Julia Roberts plays the most emotional of them all, the mother of the victim. As expected she delivers the character well, especially since it's the maternal role she's familiar with.Strangely, even with such high profile line-up, down to the supporting characters, there's low amount of thrill. The characters try to squeeze any drama they can, but the material is too sparse and it lacks the necessary tension to build a captivating mystery thriller.It may have a couple of emotionally stirring moments due to the acting prowess, yet the presentation of the thriller feels redundant and for a nearly two hours movie, there's barely any fascination at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story isn't Very Impressive but the Acting is Phenomenal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a feeling this would be a pretty intense movie from the trailer and the subject matter. I mean, dealing with something like the rape and murder of a daughter is a terrifying situation and I believe the film does an excellent job of showing us how something like this would affect those that were close to the victim, like friends and family. The talent in the movie do a great job showing us how their characters were affected by something so monstrous but there are still some flaws with the plot. The director, Billy Ray, gives us a decent film with some great drama but the story is fairly simple and, despite a few twists, doesn't keep up with the great acting provided by such a stellar cast. Let's get to the story.Ray (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Jess (Julia Roberts) are partners at a counter-terrorist agency that spend most of their time investigating a mosque in LA when something truly horrible happens to Jess's daughter. She was raped and murdered and they find her body while investigating the mosque. This causes Ray to go and find the man responsible while Jess is left to deal with her grief. The plot actually takes place in two different time periods. The plot I just described takes place in 2002 while another part is in 2015 when Ray returns to LA to reopen the case and continue the hunt for the rapist.I have absolutely no complaints about a cast of actors and actresses that are this good. The plot centers around Ejiofor's character and his investigation into the man that committed the crime and the obsession and guilt that he feels for what happened. I'm always impressed by what Ejiofor is able to do and this film is no exception. He does a pretty good job carrying the movie and I didn't even realize that he was going to be the main character going into it. Julia Roberts gives one of (in my opinion) the best performances of her career as Jess. Her personality goes through major changes during the course of the film because of the murder of Jess's daughter. We see her happy, vindictive, meek, and so much more. Nicole Kidman also plays a major role as Claire, Ray's partner during some parts of the film and his love interest. She gives us both a tough investigator and an almost innocent playfulness in her interactions with Ejiofor. However, her accent changes in some scenes which can be a little jarring but it didn't bother me too much. There are so many excellent actors and actresses in this film that I don't have time to go over all of them but let me just say that they all do a fantastic job.The acting is great, but what are the negatives you might be asking? Unfortunately, the story isn't quite as impressive as I originally thought it was going to be. Finding the murderer is surprisingly easy for Ray but we get a whole lot of talk about how they can't arrest him because of how important he is to an investigation involving a terrorist cell. We're led to believe that these people are close friends when the story begins but very few of them actually go out of their way to help Ray catch the killer. Most of the movie is just people talking about how depressed they are that more isn't being done to bring the guy to justice. Also, the film presents its plot in two different time periods simultaneously and I thought that would make it more complicated but it really doesn't. I'm not even sure what the point of doing the story this way was. It's still interesting but the movie is much more of a character piece portraying what the cast is going through rather than a straight up investigation and mystery story.I really did enjoy this film, even if it is a very depressing story. The cast was absolutely phenomenal but the plot could have used a little more work. However, if you want to see excellent actors show off their craft then this is probably the perfect movie for you. I would recommend it but just remember that it's very depressing and not really much of a mystery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An average thriller that could have been much more. The film has some good moments, and decent performances.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Secret In There Eyes, with an ensemble cast of Chiwetel Ejiofor,Julia Roberts, and Nicole Kidman one excepts nothing but a great thriller from these three very fine actors. However before entering the cinema hall I had already read some non flattering reviews of the film, so my expectations were in check.Secret In There Eyes is not a great film, nor is it a bad film either, its your average thriller which is enjoyable parts, and a stellar cast just makes the film more likable. But I most say SITE reminded me of a recently watched Bollywood flick called Jazaba, which like this film tried to manage a balance between realistic cinema, and commercial entertaining cinema. The results for both films could have been better had they both sticked to one direction, but more on that later.Story wise rising FBI investigators Ray and Jess,along with Claire,their district-attorney supervisor, are suddenly torn apart following the brutal murder of Jess' teenage daughter. Thirteen years later, after obsessively searching for the elusive killer, Ray uncovers a new lead that he is certain can permanently resolve the case and bring long-desired closure to the team. But no one is prepared for the shocking and unspeakable secret that follows.Acting wise Chiwetel Ejiofor gives a earnest mature act, and his performance is the best of the lot.Julia Roberts tends to overact, and is too melodramatic at times, but in the climax portion she shows her acting prowess. Nicole Kidman looks extremely beautiful at age 50 I must say, and does a adequate acting job. Dean Norris was good.If I was pseudo intellectual critic I could have shred this film to pieces, the film was over too Melo dramatic,it seemed like a low budget affair, the story had huge plot holes, and it was completely logic less at times, for example finding the serial killer through a picnic picture, like come on. However my criteria for critiquing a film is that was I bored through the film or not,and my answer for this film is no. I mean the film was a remake of a highly critical acclaimed Spanish film so the director Billy Ray does deserve some brunt for messing up. But the film is a decent thriller all in all, there is a bunch of twists and turns like the unexpected climax that was highly commercialized too get a certain reaction from the viewers but thats okay,the film has some really good emotional depth to get the viewers glued into the film, and the acting is very good. But with the material and actors the makers had, a better film could have been made, for a thriller the film was not racy enough, and there many weird comical scenes like when Nicole Kidman blouse buttons rip, what was the need for that, too make the film sleazy, thats commercializing at its best.Overall if your a fan of the thriller genre you can watch Secret In There Eyes, but its more of a DVD watch, because I have a feeling that film might feel a little more appealing when have not spent $11.00 dollars on it. The film deserves a 2.5/5* but I am in a good mood and in my opinion its hard to make a serial killer thriller film because the genre's already been explored a lot,so I'll give the film...3/5* or 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Secret in Their Eyes" has a great premise and terrific performances, but suffers from flaws in its logic and editing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are probably as many different evening routines over the course of an average week as there are people in the U.S. Some go to movies, while others go clubbing or just hang out with family and friends. Some stay inside pursuing hobbies like gaming, reading or even coin collecting, while others prefer to lounge in front of the TV or the computer or just go to bed early to get some extra shut-eye after a long work day. But few do anything like what ex-cop Ray Caston does. Ignoring family and friends, eschewing the simple pleasures of an enjoyable past-time, after his day's work is done, he sits in front of his office computer and scrolls through mug shots, hoping to solve a 13-year-old murder case. It's amazing what strong personal loyalty and an overwhelming sense of guilt can drive a man to do, yet that's exactly what we see play out in the mystery-thriller "Secret in Their Eyes" (PG-13, 1:51).In 2002, single mom and police officer Jess Cobb (Julia Roberts) loses her teenage daughter, Carolyn (Zoe Graham), to a brutal, cold and calculating rape and murder. For reasons we won't reveal here, Carolyn's friend and partner feels personally responsible for what happened. Ray is actually an FBI agent working with Jess on the LAPD's counter-terrorism task force, but he sets out on a mission with co-worker Bumpy Willis (Dean Norris) to find Carolyn's killer. When they think they've found their man, there's a problem? actually, several of them. Claire, the task force's prosecutor (Nicole Kidman), to whom Ray happens to be romantically attracted, doesn't think Ray has enough evidence to prosecute, while co-worker Reg Siefert (Michael Kelly) does everything he can to block Ray's investigation.You see, all this is happening just a few months after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and Los Angeles is certain that they're going to be the next target. Ray's "person of interest" in Carolyn's rape and murder is a man named Marzin (Joe Cole), a member of a local mosque out of which a terrorist sleeper cell is operating. Reg thinks that Marzin is the task force's key to breaking up that cell. Politically-ambitious L.A. district attorney, Martin Morales (Alfred Molina) won't charge Marzin, citing all the arguments that Ray gets from both Claire and Reg. Ray gets Marzin to come in for questioning and elicits what some might consider a confession, but is forced to let him go free. Claire is sympathetic but unable to help, Ray is incredibly frustrated and Jess, who was already despondent, "dies just a little bit more."Ray left the bureau shortly after the unsuccessful attempt to charge Marzin with Carolyn's murder. Claire remained a cop, but moved out to the country. Marzin dropped off the radar and Ray took a private sector job across the country, but never gave up the fight for justice, and his goal to bring some peace to his old friend. Ray's sure that a guy like Marzin would end up in the prison system eventually, so he spent his evenings (13 years' worth!) looking at digital images of every adult white male inmate in the U.S. When he finally found a familiar face, he went back to L.A. to present his evidence. Claire is now L.A.'s assistant DA, but she's skeptical of the information that Ray brings to her. At this point, even Jess seems hesitant to get involved in re-opening the case. Bumpy is still around as is willing to help, but, just like back in 2002, Ray and Bumpy are operating beyond their authority and using highly questionable methods to pursue a suspect simply based on their suspicions of who he is and what he's done."The Secret in Their Eyes" is the second film adaptation of Eduardo Sacheri's 2005 novel "La pregunta de sus ojos" ("The Question in Their Eyes"). The first was the 2009 Argentine-Spanish movie, "El secreto de sus ojos" ("The Secret in Their Eyes"). That film won an Oscar (for Best Foreign Language Film). "Secret in Their Eyes", will not (at least not for the film as a whole). The 2015 treatment is only very loosely based on the source material and has significant scripting and editing issues. The film's strengths lie in its performances, its basic premise and the story's resolution. Ejiofor and Kidman are both excellent, while Roberts gives what may be the best performance of her storied career. The drama is compelling and the plot twists late in the movie are as unexpected as they are shocking, but getting there means dealing with some non-sensical decisions by the filmmakers. The script has cops doing things that would generally ruin any chance for a successful prosecution of the guilty, and telling the story by jumping back and forth between events in 2002 and 2015 was sometimes confusing and completely unnecessary. "Secret in Their Eyes" wants to be more shocking than it is, but partially sabotages itself with fixable flaws. This movie has enough going for it to recommend it to fans of the film's actors and/or movies in the mystery and thriller genres, but it could have been so much better. Go to the movie for the drama of an Oscar-winning actress pursuing justice for her murdered daughter and stay for the wicked twists, just do your best to ignore the film's distracting editing choices and the characters' lapses in logic.

		<shortDescription>Standard Thriller With Good Actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Secret in Their Eyes", starring Chiwetel Ejiofor-The Martian, Serenity; Julia Roberts-Larry Crowne, The Mexican; Nicole Kidman- Paddington, Batman Forever and Dean Norris-Under The Dome_tv, Breaking Bad_tv.This is a mystery/thriller that is based on a foreign language film. Specifically, an Argentina movie from 2009. In the original film, the Julia Roberts character was a man and his wife was killed. In this one, Julia plays an F.B.I. agent in Los Angeles that is on the terrorism squad. This is around 2002, right after 9/11. A suspected terrorist Mosque is being watched when a girl's body is found in a dumpster, out back. The girl is Julia's daughter and, as can be expected, she is overcome with grief. Chiwetel is her partner and feels guilty about the death. It seems that he was supposed to meet the girl just hours before the murder and he bailed on her for something else. Nicole plays the new district attorney and friend of both Julia &amp; Chiwetel that tries to put the killer behind bars but of course, he gets out-he knows certain people that would prefer he not go to jail. Jump 13 years to the present and Chiwetel thinks he has found a lead on the elusive killer and tries to get Nicole to reopen the case. Dean plays a fellow officer to Julia &amp; Chiwetel that is also some nice comic relief. You do have to pay attention because the story jumps back and forth over the 13 year period, between 2002 &amp; 2015 quite a bit, and sometimes it's hard to tell what year it is. The story does show the effects of vengeance and how it can change a person. There is also a twist ending but I saw it coming. You will too, if you pay attention. It's rated "PG-13" for violence, language and sexual content-no nudity- and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 51 minutes. I don't think I would buy it on DVD but it would be a good rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Julia Roberts Changes Her Image</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pretty Woman" superstar Julia Roberts shatters her glamorous image in the grim but surprising police procedural thriller "Secret in Their Eyes," co-starring Academy Award winning actress Nicole Kidman, Oscar nominated actor Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Emmy-nominated actor Alfred Molina. This occasionally gripping but often conventional film is a remake of the superb 2009 Argentinean opus "The Secret in Their Eyes." Scripted originally with a man in mind, Roberts' steps into the rewritten supporting role as a grieving single-mom who happens to be a veteran detective determined not only to take the law into her own hands but also exact vengeance on the suspected murderer of her daughter. Furthermore, the man in the Argentinean movie was not a pistol-packing policeman, but a statistics-minded bank clerk! Reportedly, "Shattered Glass" writer &amp; director Billy Ray rewrote the role specifically for Julia Roberts. Incidentally, Ray is best known for scripting movies such as "Flightplan," "Captain Phillips," and "The Hunger Games." Of course, it remains to be seen whether Julia Roberts' loyal fans will accept the "Erin Brockovich" actress as a plain-Jane, tomboy with a sadistic streak. In contrast, murder mystery aficionados who thrive on grisly melodramas may have a tough time imagining Roberts as such a demented soul. Mind you, entertaining as this formulaic American crime saga is, it isn't as imaginative as its distinguished predecessor that took home the Best Foreign Film Oscar in 2010. Appropriately enough, the director who helmed the inspired original film, Juan José Campanella, served as the executive director for "Secret in Their Eyes." Presumably, Campanella must have conferred his blessing on the Hollywood adaptation by supervising it as an executive director. FBI agent Ray Kasten (Chiwetel Ejiofor of "American Gangster") has been reassigned to Los Angeles. He has been dispatched to assist a special anti-terrorist task force in the aftermath of New York City's 9/11 catastrophe. Ray has grown chummy with two investigators, Jess Cobb (Julia Roberts) and Bumpy Willis (Dean Norris of "Lethal Weapon 2"), but District Attorney Martin Morales (Alfred Molina of "Spider-Man 2") and gimlet-eyed Detective Reg Siefert (Michael Kelly of "Man of Steel") infuriate him. Morales has just recruited a new deputy D.A., Claire Sloan (Nicole Kidman of "Australia"), who is an statuesque blonde. Everybody, particularly Jess, soon realizes Ray is infatuated with Claire. Claire remains as cool as a glacier as she moves around Ray. Nevertheless, she is doesn't entirely ignore him. Meantime, Ray has been conducting surveillance on a mosque when a report reaches him about a Jane Doe corpse in a nearby dumpster. Everybody assembles at the mosque where the police have set-up a crime scene. Ray is the first detective to gaze into the dumpster. Horror overwhelms him when he recognizes the corpse; the dead girl, Carolyn Cobb (Zoe Graham of "Boyhood"), is none other than Jess's daughter. Distraught beyond description, Jess climbs into the dumpster and cradles her dead daughter in her arms.Eventually, Ray ferrets out an enigmatic suspect, Marzin (Joe Cole of "Offender"), on the basis of a company picnic photo. The villain is shown staring at Carolyn in the picture. Later, Ray discovers that Marzin had been hanging around the mosque. Inevitably, Ray clashes with an abrasive Morales about his conduct. Ray is an defiant FBI agent who ignores boundaries when they interfere with his objectives. Launching his own investigation, Ray refuses to share either evidence or leads with the detectives assigned to the case. Ray provokes Morales' wrath because the loose cannon FBI agent has been neglecting his prime directive. He is supposed to monitor potential terrorist threats to Los Angeles. Morales threatens to notify the FBI about Ray's insubordination and have him recalled. Nothing Morales does, however, derails Ray's obstinate search for Carolyn's murderer. At one point, Claire finds herself drawn into his investigation. Together, they expose Marzin as the killer, but events beyond their control prevent them from prosecuting this dastard."Secret in Their Eyes" inherited its flashback-riddled narrative structure from the original. The remake unfolds 13 years after Carolyn's unsolved murder as Ray shows up Los Angeles to convince Claire?now the District Attorney? that she must reopen the case because he has new evidence about the identity of the suspect. Comparatively, in the original, the hero revisited his old stomping ground 25 years afterward because he is using Carolyn's homicide as the subject for a novel. The two films switch back and forth between past and present with nimble abandon. This hopscotch technique could confuse audiences accustomed to straightforward chronological yarns. In this respect, the American version takes advantage of these incessant shifts in time to accentuate the suspense and the surprises. Whereas the Argentinean cop was not personally acquainted with the murder victim, the FBI agent worked closely with the daughter's mother as a colleague. The American remake suffers primarily from the changes that Billy Ray has made with certain characters. First, the incendiary FBI agent explodes like a powder keg and emerges as his own worst enemy. The investigator in the original rarely lost his temper. Second, the hero's partner in the Spanish film mustered greater charisma than the hero's crippled counterpart in the remake. Third, the hero's antagonist boss is neither as eloquent nor as profane as the hero's superior in the original. Fourth, the motive for the hero to return in the remake is more contrived than the hero's reappearance in the first film. Fifth, a "Gone in 60 Seconds" stolen car chop-shop scene qualifies as hopelessly gratuitous with its standard-issue shootout. Despite the flawed characters and the uneven scenes, the remake successfully duplicates more scenes from the original than it wrecks. The best example occurs when Kidman and Ejiofor collaborate to dupe the villain into confessing his crime. Unfortunately, Kidman and Ejiofor generate little chemistry as a couple supposedly attracted to each other. Altogether, "Secret in Their Eyes" doesn't surpass its infinitely superior predecessor "The Secret in Their Eyes." Nevertheless, Julia Roberts manages to broaden her repertoire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Secret in Their Eyes Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FBI investigators Ray (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Jess (Julia Roberts), along with District Attorney Claire (Nicole Kidman) are suddenly torn apart when Jess' teenage daughter Carolyn (Zoe Graham) is brutally murdered. Thirteen years later, after searching for Carolyn's elusive killer, Ray uncovers a lead that may permanently resolve the case and bring closure to Jess and the team. But no one is prepared for the shocking and unspeakable secret that follows.So this film is a remake of an Argentinian film of the same name which won the Oscar in 2010 for Best Foreign Language Film (I was not aware of this until I did a google search for the trailer) so this film has some big shoes to fill. I haven't seen this film so I can't speak to how they compare. The idea behind the plot isn't too overly complex as it involves Ray (Ejiofor) and Claire (Kidman) trying to find Jess' (Roberts) daughter's killer and bringing them to justice. We get to follow this investigation over two timelines, in 2002, the year in which the crime occurred, and in 2015, when Ray and Claire investigate Ray's new lead. For both of those investigations, Ray and Claire are joined by another investigator named Bumpy (Dean Norris) who provided some comic relief and helped to balance out the film's dark subject matter. It was interesting for me to see both investigations and how they evolved with the passing of time but what I didn't like is that it was sometimes hard to tell which time it was since the film often jumped between the two. I could not find anything discernible difference between each time as very little changed. The look stayed the same and the characters did not act too differently. One of the few benefits of the time jumping is we got to see the evolution of Roberts' Jess as her grief seems evident over the course of the thirteen years and has manifested itself as some sort of a disease. But Ray and Claire's grief has also manifested as a disease which has affected them as well and this guides them (but mostly Ray) to try and solve Carolyn's murder. There is also a romantic subplot implied between the two but it was barely covered despite feeling a little out of place with the film's darker subject matter. There was also a subplot about the person they suspected of the crime, a man named Marzin (Joe Cole), being an informant for Ray and Jess' anti- terrorism investigation of a mosque and the government was covering his involvement with the crime in order to continue using him to take down terrorists but that wasn't covered too much either. I was just a little disappointed with the film since I had my expectation set perhaps too high with the quality of actors involved but I was just let down by the story. Yes, there is a twist but it won't exactly come out of nowhere and it probably won't make any sense to you (as it did for me). The story may have let me down but the acting did not. Ejiofor's Ray was okay to me, playing the role serviceably while sometimes being a little over-the-top. Kidman was also okay despite being miscast. This was really Roberts' film despite being more of a supporting character while being advertised as more. Roberts' Jess' range of emotions and her raw, makeup-less performance is to be admired. Overall, this is an okay film which could have been much more. If you are a fan of the actors, than you should give this one a chance.Score: 6/10 keithlovesmovies.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Secret in Their Eyes (2015)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remaking the 2009 Best Foreign Film Oscar winner The Secret in Their Eyes seems somewhat unnecessary and even strange, but whether you wanted it or not, here's Secret in Their Eyes. In 2002, a tight-knit group of investigators is torn apart after one of their daughters is found brutally murdered in a dumpster. The mother vows revenge on her killer while the other FBI agents hunt for the murderer. Thirteen years later, one of them wants the case re-opened after he thinks he has found where the killer has been. The film often switches between 2002 and 2015, and the "past timeline" uses the September 11th attacks to present themes about criminality and prejudice in the country. The issue with the double setting, however, is that poor editing makes it difficult to distinguish which timeline we are watching at any given moment. You'll have to look for the grey in Chiwetel Ejiofor's beard or the length of Nicole Kidman's hair to determine if a particular scene takes place in 2002 or 2015. Despite this one persistent issue, Secret in Their Eyes is a beautifully shot, superbly acted and unpredictable crime thriller . Julia Roberts gives arguably her best performance that will unfortunately go unnoticed due to mixed reviews for this movie. She has some incredibly powerful scenes throughout the film, all of which are helped by great writing. Secret in Their Eyes might be an unnecessary remake, but it's all-star cast and moody atmosphere should make up for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Performances, Compelling Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Other than knowing that the movie was a remake/adaptation of the 2009 Academy Award winner for Foreign Film, I was not familiar with the story or plot line before seeing "Secret In Their Eyes" last Saturday, nor had I seen the 2009 Argentinian film. I found the film very engrossing and suspenseful. I think this was due both to the story itself and to the strong performances by the cast. Roberts and Ejiofor were both riveting and have earned well-deserved praise. However, I thought Nicole Kidman did a wonderful job in a role that was somewhat underwritten. While I can't speak to how well (or poorly) it fares in comparison to the 2009 original, I was completely engrossed and entertained by "Secret In Their Eyes," and am taking some friends to see it this weekend. (By the way, my vote for the worst American remake/adaptation of a foreign film goes to 1993's "The Vanishing", which not only utterly fails to approach the dread and suspense of the 1988 Dutch original but also wastes a cast that includes Jeff Bridges, Kiefer Sutherland, and Sandra Bullock, in an early role.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Julia good--movie not so much, just a midlin' thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mystery-thriller like Secret in Their Eyes should have enough twists and turns that no one's eyes are sharp enough for unraveling. While the secrets about the rape-murder of a cop's daughter are within the usual scope of this formula, the lies count as one big one around which two plot twists are couched.It's just that the admixture of justice and revenge is rather tedious, or rather it takes a long time for the real revenge to kick in, a badly needed portion of a film that lacks energy through at least two thirds of its search for the murderer. As mom Jess (Julia Roberts)lives to revenge her daughter's murder, colleague Ray (Chiwetel Ejiofor) doggedly pursues a suspect for over a dozen years, and his target may not even be the murderer.In the context of the investigation, no evidence is gripping enough to warrant our listening to the constant distress over the death and the blocks in Ray's way, which are many, and rightfully so, because the evidence against the alleged murderer is weak. That also means the plot, too, is weak.Stronger, however, is the undercurrent of lust/love between DA Claire (Nicole Kidman) and Ray, a circumstance going on as long as the investigation and like it, feckless. Given Claire's beauty and Ray's charm, even this subplot is welcome in an otherwise flabby thriller.As for Julia Roberts, hooray for makeup that makes one of film's great beauties look average and worn out. Yet, she acts as well as I have ever seen her. Kidman, on the other hand, is radiant. Because I rarely comment on the looks of any actors, you can infer that I have nothing better to talk about. Like the title, the film is inscrutable, at least as to why it is made in the first place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Completing the triangle character dynamic are Ray and Claire (Kidman), but the shape fails to show its strength. Ray is said to have been analyzing headshots for 13 years, yet we're shown him doing such for less than 15 seconds, while outside the case his obsessiveness is seen in his constant, though refreshingly unsuccessful, advances on Claire. At proverbial tip of this triangle would be the district attorney, her lawful ideals challenged by Jess and Ray's constant, and illegal, pursuit for revenge. But here in lies the crucial flaw of the dynamic's downfall: Claire, despite embodying righteousness, never has a scene to fully question and dissect the combination of relatable thirst for repentance and the legal restrictions that protect the guilty. To that, where the trailer suggested moments in which Jess addresses this, the film basically cuts them in during a final blatantly explanatory montage?providing the previewed content but not the expected substance.FULL REVIEW HERE: indieadam.com/2015/11/20/secret-in-their-eyes-2015-review-indie- adam/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie captivates your attention with the help of actors who individually did a very good job. Ejiofor is an amazing actor, Kidman has a scene where she reminds you how great of an actress she is (less make up and surgery tho, she often looks and acts like a wax figure). Dean Norris creates a personable character with very good acting as well. Last but not least Julia Roberts gives a phenomenon performance. She makes the movie actually. At the end of the movie I couldn't imagine another actress who could have done a better job. It's impressive to see how much risk she took as a movie star and proved herself again as a real actress.In terms of film making it could really have been better with better choices of the use of music and better cinematic production elements. It sometimes makes you feel like you are watching an episode of a TV crime drama, but at least a good one. It is a good movie for people who like mysteries and twist endings. The movie achieved to keep my interest and satisfy me with the ending.</fullReview>
