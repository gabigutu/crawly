		<shortDescription>Mollberg succeeds making a realistic war movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is based on Väinö Linna's novel "Unknown soldier", but the style of the movie differs dramatically from the style of the book. Linna tells his story with bitter black humour and he has war heroes, Koskela &amp; Rokka for example. Mollberg's version has neither heroes nor humour. Instead his movie is starred by blood and terror. Linna awakens, Mollberg silences.In the genre of war movies Mollberg's work is right on top, it has both artistic and realistic merits, for instance The bridge over the River Kwai lacks the latter. The way Mollberg shows his characters is, however, little too straightforward; Everyone is described thru one mental quality, Lehto is always cynical etc. The mythic silence that surrounds Koskela grows to the astronomical. On the other hand Mollberg succeeds in filming the fear and anger.The greatest finnish film ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The antithesis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rauni Mollberg's (from now on referred to as 'Molle') Tuntematon Sotilas has been left far behind in fame to its predecessor, that of Edwin Laine's Tuntematon Sotilas from 1955. This is not surprising as the newer movie lacks the sentiment that is almost omnipresent in the older version. Despite this, is Molle's version more faithful to the original novel by Väinö Linna who was himself involved in making of the new version. Both movies however deserve their place, in Edwin Laine's time there was a need for high national epic but as the times changed a new version was also welcome and maybe even in demand.Molle's version deserves perhaps more praise and attention than it has been used to have, but also criticism. The newer version is no way meant to be 'a better' version but rather an alternative account of the psychological reality of a man. Therefore I call it an antithesis, it is impossible to see the newer version without comparing it to the all too familiar older version. You actually need to watch the film several times before it really opens to you in the way Molle had intended it. Tuntematon Sotilas is a war film, but the highlight is upon the people who fought in there, both Finns and Russians, who are brought to suffer the very same meat-grinder. Parts of it are funny, parts of it are disgusting.What is left to a lesser notion is historicity, the weapons and uniforms are from the second world war but you should not expect them to appear in correct order. For the weapon freaks be it informed that the same KV-1's appear as both Finnish and Soviet tanks. For those who already know everything that has been written about the Continuation War this movie does not offer any historical references, this time it is all literature from the ground view. Nevertheless this is one of the best war films there is, perhaps there is a conscious focus and perhaps there is some message, but the weight of the overall work will just make you silent.If you are going to see this film, make sure you are watching a quality copy. Many dark scenes have become incomprehensible in poor quality VHS transfers. The darkness is essential visual effect in Molle's version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good war-movie about Finland in World War II</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is following a Finnish platoon in Finlands struggle against Soviet Union in the Continuation War starting in 1942. In the beginning the men are conscripts who are sent to the front when Finland attacks SU in hope of getting back the area that SU took from Finland in Winter War in 1940. In the beginning Finland is victorious but then the luck turns... Finland has to start its retreat. The men are just 19-year-old boys when the war starts, but in the end they are heroes who kept the Finland independent despite of the massive Soviet Army.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree in saying it's nothing on the original.One thing I will compliment this movie on is one thing it's criticized for - the fact it was hand-held camera. There is almost no shaky movements within the whole movie - for a fact there is only one shot out of the whole movie that really bothered me.This movie also seems like it is a movie too reliant on showing realistic war violence (a previous reviewer from the Finnish army actually said it's realistic war violence) rather than telling a story - which the original tried to do.For recreations of some of the scenes in this there are sometimes when the reenactments of the original were just the same others when it was worse and there was only one scene out of the whole thing that I thought was reenacted better than the original - The scene where the medic truck was bombed - because of the previous scene where you see wounded soldiers cry out in pain and then you see it being bombed by Russians, Mollberg only made that scene better executed than the one made 30 years prior.In this movie they don't humanize the Russians like in Talvisota but this time they don't really portray the Finns as good kind-hearted saints, there is a bit in the movie where a Finn shoots a Russian soldier taken prisoner.Overall: Decent remake - so that means it's a better remake than most.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1985 version is more true</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes in life you want to experience something true and realistic. Molmberg's Unknown Soldier comes as close as it is possible in movie to experience war. Linna's 1955 version was more theatrical and entertaining. It had it's merits but I like Molmberg's better.In early 1990's I did my military service in Finland and trained a lot attack in the forest and the attack on the bunker line in Molmberg's film looks, sounds and almost smells the same. All details are in place and they really fire Maxim MG's and Suomi SMG's.I think you can't do good war movie without showing the ugly side of war. Molmberg shows the true nature of war. War is totally evil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The evil twin brother of the unknown soldier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rauni Mollberg's version of the Unknown Soldier, the novel of Väinö Linna, has always been the one that has been compared to the first movie version directed by Edvin Laine 30 years earlier. The times have changed between 1955 and 1985 and it shows. Laine's Unknown was jolly and cheerful, almost farce-like when compared to this one. Mollberg's Unknown is grimmer and wants to show the darker shades even darker and deeper than the first one. Laine skips the difficult themes like plundering of enemy cities and the executions of the soldiers sentenced in court-martial quite quickly or doesn't handle them at all. Mollberg obviously wants to dig deeper in them but hasn't left out any of the original scenes either. Hence the titanic length of the film.When one has seen the Laine's version so many times as, for example, I have, it is difficult to form an objective opinion about Mollberg's version. The first impression stresses the darkness and seriousness of the atmosphere. It would be OK, if all the actors seemed natural, but they don't. Of course, all the actors in the first version don't seem natural either, but hey, it's Laine's Tuntematon Sotilas! Who cares!? This one gets better along the way, though. You get used to the "new sides of the characters" and forgive some of their faults compared to the old ones. I have to say I haven't read the novel so fortunately I don't have to compare this film to the book. Fortunately, because the book usually overcomes the movie versions. Because of my illiterate manners, I cannot compare this film to the original novel, and again, cannot say how much this one is more or less true to the novel than Laine's film. Therefore, I can only compare these two films. This version has its strengths. It is in some ways more realistic and brings out the characters more than Laine's version, which is almost like an action movie because of its fast pace and light atmosphere. But sometimes Mollbergs Unknown is almost too dark and grim to believe. This is a nice film but it doesn't compare to the first one, which, unfortunately for this film, is a legend. However, Mollberg's Unknown couldn't make it without Laine's version, because to me, it could not stand alone without the legendary memories experienced with the scenes in the first one. Mollberg's Unknown adds something to the "one and only" but that's all there is to it. I first and foremost recommend Laine's Unknown and after that, if you have some extra four hours on your hands, take a look at this Mollberg's view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a realistic film about the 2 world war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This new version of Tuntematon Sotilas is very different from the earlier one made during the fifties, when Finland still had vivid memories from the war. In Mollberg's version there are less humour, and in addition to this there are nothing left of the nationalism, that we are used to connect with this kind of movies. Tuntematon Sotilas reflects about the situation of the soldier and the front-men as a mass. Instead of pathetic patriotism the film tells about the war without great gestures and bloody action scenes. The director keeps Väinö Linna's very critical outlook on the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Unknown Soldier 1985</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edvin Laine did it first and brought Väinö Linna's Tuntematon Sotilas to the big screen.The year was 1955.Tuntematon Sotilas (1985) is directed by Rauni Mollberg.Linna's novel is a classic, which I read last year.And so is the first version of the novel.They show it on every Independence Day (Dec 6) here in Finland.This year, that marked the 94th anniversary of our country, made no exception.I didn't watch it this year, but instead I borrowed this new version from the library.The cast consists of some known names, and there are also a lot of amateur actors.The more known names are Risto Tuorila (Koskela), Pirkka-Pekka Petelius (Hietanen), Paavo Liski (Rokka), Pertti Koivula (Lahtinen), Kari Väänänen (Lammio), Veikko Tiitinen (Kaarna), Risto Salmi (Korpela) and Yrjö Parjanne (Colonel).This doesn't get too close to the original.The 1980's war between Finland and Russia differs pretty much from the 1950's version of it.The battle scenes look good, but what I missed was the humor of the first movie.There's some, but it's not very funny.Even though it's war, it doesn't have to be so serious.Often, in horrendous situations, such as war, humor is the way to cope with it.The original is a classic, this is just a decent war movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I find the 1985 version superior over 1955 version.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find the 1985 version of "Tuntematon sotilas" far superior over the older version. The new version is much more realistic in its description of the war. The actors are of real age instead of the original movie. Also all the battle scenes really give the feeling of chaos when defensive lines are shattered and despair takes over the men.The film describes continuation war with good accuracy. Also I like how the characters develop over the film. At start the green men who are panicking easily and so afraid of the enemy who they don't even see... To the heroic defensive battles against Russian tank hordes at the end.Many of the since-unknown actors have now become main pillars of Finnish movies and entertainment. Mollberg's idea of using less famous people than Laine did in his version works. When movie was released the faces weren't familiar - and so the characters are much more neutral.All-in-all I consider the 1985 Tuntematon sotilas as one of the best and realistic war movies ever made, close to second is "Winter War" - another Finnish war movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different politics from the Edvin Laine version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm writing this 19 years after I saw Mollberg's Unknown Soldier in Helsinki's Bristol Theatre. However, seeing the original 1955 film somewhat recently, and being comparative to the Väinö Linna historical novel, it raised memories of that 1985 rendition. Mollberg certainly made a far superior film as far as cinematography and aesthetic realism is concerned. He used a familiar technique of confusion in combat by utilizing the cameraman on foot, and running. Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan had these effects in 1998, but I'm not insinuating that Rauni Mollberg invented it. Perhaps Elem Klimov in "Come and See" (Soviet Union, 1985) had these stylistic effects. That USSR film, in my opinion, is the most anti-war film ever made. As far as Finnish war films, I would recommend "Talvisota" (Winter War)(1989), and "Täällä Pohjantähdenalla" (Here Under the North Star)(1968), with a sequel in 1971 titled "Akseli ja Elina". These last three are indicative of the tragedy of the Finnish Civil War, and WW2, and how they affected not only a family, but various social classes of society in Finland. This phenomenon of class hatred exists today in Finland.Rauni Mollberg's 1985 version of the Unknown Soldier also included this biased left-wing attitude towards the soldiers, but especially officers of the Russo-Finnish wars. Essentially, in the theatre and film world of 1970's and 1980's Finland, one had to be the figurative "Communist." Fortunately that has changed since, at least a bit.Having rambled, "Unknown Soldier" (1985) and the aforementioned film reviews, really only interest certain film historians, as well as historians of Soviet-Finnish politics. I hope that I gave you some insight.Respectfully, Timppa</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Holy shaky-camera, Batman!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Essentially the same plot as the infinitely superior version made 30 years prior, UNKNOWN SOLDIER (TUNTEMATON SOTILAS, 1985) provides little new and is very amateurishly made. The camera work is almost completely hand-held and there is little or no lighting or attempt to make any of the visuals even the slightest bit aesthetically pleasing. Sometimes the cameraman just drifts back and forth from subject to subject with little or no reason to do so - it's like a home video made in a war zone! This is a remake in the true sense of the word. All the main episodes from the original 1955 version are redone, with a little exception as to when and where a few characters die. Like the original, it's awfully episodic but it doesn't carry any of the drama. This is the sort of story that needed the stark black and white, the locked-down camera angles, and the larger than life 50's-style acting to bring the book pages to life.The '85 version is overall quite poor and unimpressive as a war drama or action film. I went to some lengths to find it and import it into the states, and I feel as though I wasted my money. But don't let that dissuade you from watching the excellent 1955 original TUNTEMATON SOTILAS, or even better TALVISOTA (THE WINTER WAR, 1989) which is sort-of a prequel to this film... in that it shows what the Continuation War was a continuation of.</fullReview>
