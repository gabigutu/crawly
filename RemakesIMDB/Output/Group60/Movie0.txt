		<fullReview>This movie is of almost generation-defining importance to some of us born in the early post-war years in that (and especially if you were born between 1946 and 1953 and loved spending Saturday afternoons at your neighborhood movie house) you almost certainly saw it. And the memory of seeing it has probably stayed with you. It's style is the stuff of a brief and somehow gloriously exciting moment in our growing up days. It had a modern, space-age storyboard for the audiences of it's time. The set was any town with a supermarket and a movie theater that would be packed for a Friday midnight show. It has hot rods and rebellious youth, but in the 'why can't they let us have fun' way rather than the disturbed, histrionic rebel-without-a-cause way. All characters were identifiable to us - teens, parents, the old man, the doctor, the nurse, the mechanic, the boy, the puppy, even the cops - were sympathetic to us. We could relate to them allIt had a singularly horrifying monster. It's first victim is heard moaning 'it hurts.....it hurts' and we were convinced and frightened. The menace grows continually throughout the story. There are intense periods of suspense, colourful effects, a fabulous lead in McQueen, and moments of humour, both intended and not. It even had an almost over-the-top sad part to make the more sensitive of us feel like crying.I saw it in summer, age 9 or so, double billed with 'I Married A Monster From Outer Space', and was so thrilled by the experience of this particular double feature that I went back a couple more times before it left. Everyone I knew saw it. Everyone I knew loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is wonderful. What separates it from other 50's sci-fi is the fact that the alien has no features, no face, eyes, anything, yet it can't be killed. I especially like the idea that this film doesn't take place over a few days, it takes place in one night, lasting supposedly past midnight.It's also scary that once the blob gets on you, you can't get it off. you're stuck in it, as it dissolves your flesh and slowly devours your body. My all time favorite 50's sci-fi film, and what is sometimes considered the quintessential one. I can see why this rocketed Steve McQueen to stardom. All this and a catchy theme song! How can you go wrong?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smarter than the average horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read many of the user comments and I think that the film is generally not getting credit for being a smart thriller. Why does the monster have to be on-screen to make it good? Hitchcock said that suspense plays better than action and although this film missed many opportunities to be more suspenseful, it's is at least not stupid.In how many horror films today does the hero know the monster and its nature when he should? Steve knows what he's dealing with almost from the beginning and his frustration is not being able to convince the authorities.Yet the authorities act in a totally credible way as well, even the annoying sergeant. Who would believe such a story from a bunch of "kids" (we know Steve wasn't a kid, but his character is).One key example of the movie's intelligence: Steve is yelling to Dave to get CO2 fire extinguishers long after Dave has already gotten the message and dispatched people to get them. How many movies made in the 90s would be smart about this subtle detail?I'm really tired of watching movies and having people behave in ways different than they really would in real life (the most irritating recent example is Tom Hanks falling asleep with the flashlight on in Cast Away). Horror films in particular do this in spades (which is why the Scream films have been so popular), but The Blob, to me, stayed pretty true to its characters, and in so doing made a smarter and better film.Yes there are many flaws, perhaps biggest is Steve McQueen's very uneven performance, but I think they missed key opportunities for suspense that could have turned this above average, kinda scary, kinda funny movie that's a cult favourite into a true classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Blob is a classic 1950s B-movie sci-fi flick. You probably know the story: two teens (Steve McQueen &amp; Aneta Corsaut) see a meteorite hit the ground, and when they go to look for it, they run into an old man with some weird...blob attached to his arm. They take him to the doctor's office, and then go to find out what happened. From there, the blob spreads, eating everyone in its path. The special effects are cheesy fun, as is the story. There are a lot of great touches, like the cop who plays chess over the radio with a cop in another district. It's no masterpiece, but it has a special place in its genre. Steve McQueen is very good. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a fun time can be had watching The Blob! A meteorite with a blob inside it lands, attatches itself to an old man's hand, engulfs the old man, a nurse, a doctor, and so on...until it is a huge mass of jelly-like substance squeezing through small openings and killing anything and everything in its path. A very young Steve McQueen plays the small-town teenager who just can't get any of the establishment(adults) to listen to him. The film was shot with a shoestring budget and the actors, with the exception of McQueen who shows talent and personality even at this youthful age, range from mediocre to downright bad(Doc Hallen for example), but none of that is overly important to the monster itself. Nothing like it had ever been on film before and some scenes stand out as decidedly very original and memorable. The Spook Movie festival in the movie theater and the finale at the diner are such classic scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No hidden agenda. Pure scifi. All fun.I saw the original on TV and was scared pretty bad. I was a kid :)The original one can be appreciated more when compared to the new one which I saw and have forgotten. The original one, starring the great movie star Steve McQueen (BULLET), is by far the better and only version anyone should see.The movie production is dated, but the fx used to make the Blob stands up the test of time. I was convinced that that thing was moving on its own accord. 10/10-Zafoid</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic All On It's Own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I look at this page, and it seems disapproving to me to have to listen to someone ramble and rant at a real classic. Sure, I agree to let everyone have their opinion, but here's mine:This movie should not be missed by any classic horror watcher, and should be seen many casual viewers around the world. Sure, it has lost some of it's flair and greatness with age, especially in todays world of CGI effects, but that's not why you should like it.You should like it because it actually is a scary movie, even for today's standards. It's overall ickyness will creep you out just as much as the original audiences, so don't slam a classic if you haven't given it a chance. Watch it, but not with a critical attitude. Watch it to have fun, how it was originally intended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King of Kool's first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only notable thing about this film is that it was Steve McQueen's first big starring role.McQueen's talent is undeveloped and raw but refreshingly honest in this campy little sci-fi horror piece. Steve shows himself as the anti-establishment, hot rod car loving actor who would become a polished icon of the film industry just five years hence.Later on, McQueen would say he hated this film and that "he was the blob". But everyone has to start somewhere and The Blob is cute, fresh and innocent. Would that we all had stayed that way.The plot is fast paced and although predictable, still an entertaining hour or so. And it's really fun to see Steve McQueen before he became The King of Kool (and Anita Corsaut before she became Andy Taylor's girlfriend). A close friend sent me the DVD a while back and it's a treasured addition to my Steve McQueen film collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who would think Andy Griffith's "Helen Crump" (Aneta Corsaut) had a Steve McQueen movie in her past? But that is only one of several weird and wonderful things about the ultimate 1950s teenagers-battle-creatures movie, which might best be described as Rebel Without A Cause meets God Knows What From Outer Space. The Rebel is Steven McQueen (who would shortly decide that "Steve" sounded less prissy), a good boy with just enough wild to be interesting; the very wholesome yet understanding girlfriend is the aforementioned Aneta Corsaut. It was bad enough when their date was disrupted by teenage hot-rodders, but they are considerably more nonplussed when they encounter a gelatinous, man-eating What Is It that rides down to earth on its own hotrod meteor--and begins gobbling up townfolk right and left. But will the grown ups believe them? Of course not, what do they know, they're just kids!The movie is teeny bopper at its teeny bopping best. The actors take the rather pretentious script very seriously, with many a soulful look into each other eyes, and the "adult" supporting cast probably says "Kids!" very third sentence or so. But the real pleasure of the film its creature, which is well imagined, well-executed, and often manages to generate a surprising degree of suspense. And although clearly on the cheap side (check out those miniature sets, guys!), THE BLOB is actually a fairly well-made film--and there's that catchy little theme song thrown in for good measure. The 40-plus crowd (myself included) will enjoy the movie as nostalgia, but that won't prevent them from hooting right along with the younger set at its whole-milk-and-white-bread 1950s sensibility, and the film would be a great choice for either family-movie night or a more sophisticated "grown ups only" get together. Make plenty of Jello cubes for movie snacking! Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely the very first film that scared me to death. I happened catch it when my older brother(r.i.p.) was watching it. It was on a black and white TV and not really a good picture but it got me interested. Shortly after, my folks bought a color set and, as luck would have it, The Million Dollar Movie was showing it one Sunday.I had forgotten most of the plot, but it did not take long to catch up...and I got so scared I had a hard time sleeping that night! I mean sure it was just a movie but it involved a creature that not only came from space, but you could not hear it, or see it...and once it got hold of you it was too late. Even now, after all this time it still sends a shiver up my spine. A true classic, and even better a classic that I have seen scare the pants off a new generation!Long live The Blob!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pure terror at age ten in 1958</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't aware of Steve McQueen in 1958. I only knew that I was extremely frightened about going to see this film. (I'd been devastated by the movie "Trantula" at age seven . . . but I was ten now). The 1st scene where the Blob crawls up the farmer's probing stick and engulfs his hand was enough to make me want to leave the theater. But I stayed and suffered through each of our monster's attacks. I felt such horror when Steve and his girl barely made it out of the doctor's office (poor doc), and even more when The Blob entered a movie theater and devoured a large portion of the audience . . . so many in fact that IT oooooozzzzzzed out of the front doors, too huge now to fit through just one. It seemed indestructible and unlimited in growth potential, and when it trapped poor Steve in a sieve-like diner, he seemed like a sure dinner to be. To say that the Blob was cold would be a modern day description, but in the end, better icy than scaring and mentally rupturing little kids.I remember walking home that evening with my uncle Nick, trying to act brave. He knew I was in trouble, and when I got into bed that night I could not only feel the Blob in the room, but when I summoned up the courage to look down at the floor, there the red pulsating, heart-like hungry dude sat, waiting for me to try and get up and go to the bathroom. It took months to recover. I'm 57 years old now . . . I've made it.Of course The Blob wasn't destroyed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE BLOB.....a classic pro-society horror film. Ten Stars!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE BLOB is a great horror movie, not merely because of the vividly horrific images of its nearly unstoppable, flesh-dissolving title character, but because it features a real societal message. It is, in many ways, a "feel-good horror film." The clever storyline is helped immeasurably by solid performances from the entire cast. The two romantic leads, Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsaut, bring surprising depth and sentimentality to the proceedings. They are misunderstood but very well-meaning young people, and it's very easy to root for them.This is a pro-society movie, and its juvenile delinquent characters cause trouble mainly out of boredom, not out of some malevolent character flaw. Steve McQueen's drag-racing rival almost appears to be an enemy early on in the proceedings, but quickly joins in McQueen's campaign to save the town from the oozing invader once he sees McQueen's seriousness. In this way, a character situation that at first appears to be cartoonish suddenly develops depth and human realism.The authorities' initial skepticism of the kids' wild claims is proved wrong--and once the threat is acknowledged by all, all conflict within the society disappears. This unification of purpose, and the validation of the "troublemaking" teens, becomes official when Aneta Corsaut's father breaks into the school to obtain the fire extinguishers needed to freeze the Blob. On any other day, breaking into the school would be considered an act of vandalism typical of a juvenile delinquent--on this particular day, it is a necessary action performed by an adult authority figure. At this turning point, it is clear that there are no lines of division between the young and the old.This is an unusual film in that it acknowledges the perception of a "generation gap" but suggests that it is more imaginary than real, and that given a real crisis, people will naturally band together to restore order. "The Blob" is a perfect tonic for the kind of depression that generally comes with a viewing of "Night of the Living Dead" (1968).Much has been made of the film's cheap but innovative (and effective!) visual effects. They are undeniably clever. A lot of the gravity-defying tricks we see the Blob perform were achieved with miniature sets designed to be rotated. The camera was typically attached to the sets in a very firmly "locked down" position (the lights had to be similarly attached so that the lighting remained steady as the room was turned this way and that). These scenes were often photographed one frame at a time as the room was slowly turned--the silicone blob oozed very slowly and its action needed to be sped up. In a way, this was similar to stop motion photography, but utilizing a blob of silicone rather than an articulated puppet. Even today, the effects are startling and bizarre.A very good film with an exploitative-sounding title, THE BLOB is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A meteorite falls in the country of a small town, bringing a jelly creature. An old farmer is attacked by the alien in his hand, and the youths Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen) and his girlfriend Jane Martin (Aneta Corsaut) take him to Dr. T. Hallen (Steven Chase). The local doctor treats carefully the blister, and asks Steve to investigate the location where they found the old man. When Steve returns, he sees the blob killing the doctor. Steve and Jane try to warn the police and the dwellers, but nobody believe on them, while the blob engulfs many people, getting bigger and bigger."The Blob" is a cult and classic sci-fi. It is a low budget movie, with many ham actors and actresses (with the exception of Steve McQueen), awful effects, but also delightful and very, but very funny. This is the first time that I see this classic (I had seen the 1988 remake with Kevin Dillon), and I really recommend it to fans of Steve McQueen and sci-fi B-movies from the 50s. The film subject of my review number 1,400 could not be better. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "A Bolha" ("The Blob")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This hugely entertaining b-movie starts off with an insanely catchy rockabilly song that perfectly sets the mood for what's to come. This movie never makes the mistake of taking itself seriously, which is what made it such an effective thriller. The acting was actually pretty stiff, and the main characters aren't that interesting, but the director is really good at keeping this viewer in suspense. The blob was pretty ridiculous, but I still tensed up whenever I saw it on screen. And like I said in the summary, this movie has a sense of humour, which is important in low budget science fiction.I also found the special effects to be clever. The Blob slithered under doorways, through vents, and up people's legs. It was kind of obvious how they did a lot of it,but I personally think that's part of the charm of pre-cgi effects.Bottom Line: If you're expecting great acting and character development, skip this, but if you like b- movies, it's a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A giant amoeba-like alien terrorises the small community of Phoenixville, Pennsylvania.Jack H. Harris, a cheapo producer of such fodder like Schlock and Dinosaurs! couldn't believe his luck when Steve McQueen's popularity finally got his goo starring movie noticed. The Blob is not, as some 50s sci-fi lovers want you to believe, a quintessential movie in the pantheon of creature features and B movie sci-fi's. It's a silly movie that is nothing more than a teenager drive-in movie made to pass the time away necking with your respective partners. There's some value in McQueen's performance, who at least has an aura of believability about his character, but he's almost submerged and lost to the audience on account of being surrounded by bad actors and even worse writing. There's a groovy title tune to enjoy, where the names of Bacharach &amp; David being involved opens the ears and raises a pleasing eyebrow. While the location work and colour photography is technically agreeable. But really there's not much else on offer here. No it isn't an astute movie about the looming threat of communism, and no it isn't a movie ahead of its time. It's campy fun for sure, but ultimately it's disposable at best. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cheesy horror flick that happens to be very well done!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey, I know all about the campy horror flicks of the 50's, with the women screaming at the cameras while the monsters carry them away. A spoof of that genere was made into the movie "Matinee", which was inspired by William Castle. But, if any one of those flicks stands out as something actually very good, it would be "The Blob"! The performances, including Steve McQueen's, really give the film life, instead of a mindless junk fest for teenagers. The blob itself, is a really scary monster, because it has no shape, no face, no reactions to anything. Nothing! Just an ooze of slime that crawls along, looking for more things to eat. Things like "The Fly" just look hilarious, with big bulging eyes, and a helpless woman screaming at the top of her lungs. Suprisingly, "The Blob" has very little of that. You will have fun with this flick! Oh, and take my advice, STAY AWAY FROM THE REMAKE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young couple out for a night of fun get more than they bargained for when attacked by 'The Blob'. While taking a drive with his girlfriend Jane, Steve see's an old man in the road with something on his hand, begging for help. It all begins when something mysterious lands on Earth, a giant blob which resembles a jelly latches onto an old man's hand. When the couple take the man to the clinic, they think it's all over. But it's only the beginning. The blob completely consumes the man as well as the doctor and therefore grows bigger and bigger. Pretty soon it rolls around the little town, killing anything in sight. It's up to Steve, Jane and the police force to put an end to it's reign of terror before it consumes everyone.Watching 'The Blob' in 2013 made me realize that this 1958 film actually dates pretty well. The fashion and acting isn't all that different (or over the top) than what we see now. It's well acted with Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsaut leading the way, and I'm sure was genuinely creepy at the time it was released. There are quite a few tense moments in which the giant blob attacks the doctor and nurse at the local clinic, and then goes after movie-goers at a theatre! It was very well done, the director did a great job at creating panic and the sense of fear with the people in the town. It can get a little slow around the middle frame after a strong start, that's probably the film's biggest weakness. However, the ending scenes when it attacks at the theatre and the diner are worth sticking around for. I also liked that the entire movie takes place on one night, it helps it not drag on and on too much. Highly recommended "old time" monster movie.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw "The Blob" on TV back in the '70s when I was about eight years old and it scared the unholy crap out of me. (I was a nervous type kid.) Seeing it again as a grown man, I smiled a lot at how relatively mild-mannered it is by today's standards, but "The Blob" is still a ton of fun. A young Steve McQueen (billed as "Steven" here for the first and only time in his career) plays the plucky, square-jawed teenage hero (despite the fact that he was 27 when he made the movie) who battles valiantly against the usual group of unbelieving grown-ups (who's gonna take the word of a teen-age hot rodder?) in order to save his small town from a man-eating alien hunk of goo that crashes to earth inside a meteor and begins absorbing townspeople at an alarming rate overnight. The title creature may resemble a wiggling, chewed up hunk of bubble gum, but you gotta love those attack scenes shot from The Blob's point of view (did they use a "Blob Cam?") and that oh-so-catchy theme song ("It creeps! It leaps! It slides, it glides across the floor!"). Admittedly "The Blob" suffers a bit from a few slow patches in the middle of the film where Steve and his fellow teens do more talking than anything else, but once the third act begins and the creature oozes into a sold-out midnight horror movie show at the local theatre, causing mass panic, it's golden. "The Blob" is an iconic piece of 50s sci-fi/horror, no doubt, and it's just as much fun to watch today as it must've been "back in the day." "The Blob" was remade in the late 80s by "Nightmare on Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors" director Chuck Russell (I like that version as well), and now I'm hearing that Rob Zombie's next film project will be yet another new version of "The Blob." What puzzles and worries me is that Zombie says the first thing he's going to change in his remake is that there won't be "a big, red Blobby thing. I hate that." Now, how the hell are you going to make a "Blob" movie WITHOUT a big, red Blobby thing? Blasphemy!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic 58's original in one of the first roles of Steve McQueen as intrepid young man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This original version with Steve McQueen is a camp classic that was shot in low budget. It deals about a small town besieged by an enormous, man-eating amoebic mass and fast-growing that land over earth from exterior space. As a meteorite is the origin a strange substance that devours anything it finds.Our hero is a rebellious youngster who saves the damsel in distress and taking on the impressive blob. The picture terminates with an interrogation ¨? ¨ on the Antartic.This short budget film contains noisy action, suspense, grisly murders and emotion. This flick provides great load of screams, terror, creepy atmosphere which becomes pretty sinister with the mound of glop appearing. It's a sleek production with genuine thrills, tension, chills and regular special effects, making an exciting slimy jello invader and frightening and horrifying to the audience by that time . This moving movie packs astonishing scenes as when the large blob exploding through the theater screen(meanwhile the spectators are seeing a film starred by Bela Lugosi, the mark of the vampire) and people stampede from cinema, furthermore when the Thing invades the Downing Town Diner among others. The film packs an atmospheric cinematography with ominous camera angles, colorful atmospheres and moody woods. The motion picture is professionally directed by Irvin S. Yearworth Jr. Rating : Acceptable and passable, well worth watching. The producers wish thanksgivings to people of Downingtown, Phoenix, Pennsylvania where the movie was shot. It's followed by ¨ Beware, the Blob(1972)¨ in which a technician brings a frozen specimen of the original Blob from the Pole and is directed by actor Larry Hagman (JR) with Robert Walker Jr and Dick Van Patten ; plus ¨The Blob (1988)¨ by Chuck Russell with Kevin Dillon and Shawnee Smith that is cool tribute to the original movie and contains better FX and lots of blood and gore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of the Atomic Age monster movies I saw on television as a kid- and some of them, THE BLOB included, scared the daylights outta me. Movies like INVADERS FROM MARS made it all too clear to us "small fry" that kids just weren't to be trusted when it came to things like things invading the Homeworld; THE BLOB just reiterated that fact. I recall, fondly, late evenings spent stretched on the floor watching as Body Snatchers and Martian Invaders and Blobs seeped into an unsuspecting society. There was a summer, in the early 1980s, when a local science museum (in Richmond, Virginia) ran an Atomic Age classic every weekend. These were 16mm films, and most were black and white (and the projector was noisy), and the "color" print of THE BLOB had faded to a faint pink- but, man, was it fun. I dragged my mother along, and she enjoyed it as much as I did. It was there, at that science museum, that I truly fell in love with THE BLOB. The filmmaker's intent was, of course, to make money- but it was the sincerity of all involved, from the filmmakers to the "talent" (the players), that made me fall in love with this movie. Corny? You bet. Cheesy? They don't get any cheesier. But, man, what a movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I hadn't seen "The Blob" since I was 7 or 8 and viewing it as an adult was an incredible experience. Pages could be written on its influence on horror films even today. And even more could be written on its social subtext with the 50s "fear of teenagers". But this simple little tale of interplanetary horror is still a damn fine scary movie if you let it be.Sure, it looks cheesy as all get out in our modern world. But "The Blob" packs in some genuinely frightening moments as a band of kids track the unstoppable creature when then adults don't believe them. In fact, there are even some pretty bleak moments in its candy-colored world. And Steve McQueen gives so much more than the story deserved on paper that we the viewers really get caught in the moment and believe in him.To sum up, if you can take off your postmodern irony filter, there's a lot more to love here than meets the eye.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fondly remembered "classic"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mention the words "The Blob" to most people in their 40s and 50s and you'll get a knowing grin in return. Treated by the critics at the time of its release as just another teen monster movie (which it pretty much is), this film struck a chord among teens of the time that most other films of its kind didn't. It's difficult to say exactly why. While Steve McQueen's good lucks and charm are much in evidence, his performance isn't much different from those in other films of its type. The effects are good, but not great. The plot is pretty much your standard alien-life-form-endangers-Earth story. So what is it about "The Blob" that makes people remember it so fondly?For one thing, it's in color, where most films of its type were in black and white. For another thing, it had some great old hot rods in it, something a lot of teenage boys (and boys whose teenage years were far behind them) could identify with. Also, the teenagers in the movie didn't act like teenagers at the time were so often portrayed: wise-ass, smart-mouthed punks. There were no false heroics, either; the kids--and the sheriff and the other authorities--got together once the danger was recognized and banded together to fight it.Probably the main reason people like it, though, is that it's just so damn much fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Blob was quite a good film expect for two faults I will get to later. The premise of the film was interesting-a meteorite lands on earth and a strange red substance comes out of it. This substance devours people and gets bigger and bigger-and it cannot be destroyed by conventional means.The late Steve McQueen does a great job as the hero Steve Andrews and credit must go to the rest of the cast, particularly those playing the three policemen who didn't believe Steve Andrew's story at first.Back to the minor faults of this film-I think it was a bit too short to realize it's full potential. Some of the scenes did seem wasted particularly the drag race. This film would have been better if it had been close to two hours.Secondly, I found the ending a bit rushed and a bit of an anti-climax. I won't spoil it for you but after watching what I thought was a reasonable film, the ending kind of spoilt it. It was like watching an exciting soccer match that ended in a draw.But, The Blob was decent enough for it's time and worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Danger, The Blob has come to town</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen The Blob several times and is one of the better low budget alien invasion movies from the 1950's.A strange meteor lands just outside a small town and an elderly man goes to investigate this. A strange jelly like substance then attaches itself to one of his arms and a young couple who saw the meteor land arrive in time and take him to the local doctor's, where the old man then gets completely absorbed by the mass. The doctor and his nurse are the next victims and the mass is getting bigger. When these incidents are reported to the police, they don't believe the young couple and accuse them of making all this up. They finally believe them when the mass, now huge turns up in the town's cinema and everybody runs into the streets screaming. It then attaches itself on a diner with the young couple and some others inside. The Blob is stopped by spraying a load of fire extinguishers at it and it freezes, which is its weakness. It is then transported by plane to the frozen wastes of the Arctic and disposed of there. But it is only frozen, not dead...This movie has a typical setting for its period: teenagers and a small town. The Blob has a good rock and roll style theme song at the beginning and the movie is atmospheric throughout.The sequel, Beware! The Blob followed in 1972 and a remake came in 1988 but this is the best of The Blob movies.The cast is lead by Steve McQueen (The Great Escape)and is the movie that made him a star and Aneta Corsaut plays his girlfriend. I'm not familiar with any of the other stars.The Blob is a must see for all sci-fi fans. Fantastic.Rating: 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Campy Sci-Fi Classic with an Unfortunate Love of Lingering</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A small bubble of jelly tumbles dramatically from the sky, landing in the woods just outside Main Street USA, and swiftly begins absorbing and digesting the town's population. Naturally, the only ones to understand this predicament are a small tribe of no-good teenagers, and the crusty old grown-ups don't listen to a word until it's almost too late. It's a classic sci-fi trope, from the heart of Hollywood's cheap, silly, sci-fi boom, and that's always fun to watch? to a certain extent. After jumping right in with a first-scene asteroid crash, though, The Blob loses its way fairly quickly, dragging its feet through all manner of slow, dry, window-gazing scenes while the monster gets busy somewhere decidedly off-screen. The attraction is a blob of man-eating goo, but the film seems more concerned with the history of kid-cop-parent relations in this sleepy little borough. It drags on forever, until it's suddenly time to wrap things up and then we rush through all the good stuff in a quick, delirious blur. It's in that quick, vibrant sprint that we enjoy all the best shots - a stampede to escape the theater, a fully-engulfed diner - but they're mere glances, and none seem blessed with the right amount of gravitas. The history books tell us that this was never intended to be a hallmark of the genre, and that much is clear. The studio didn't think much of it because, apart from a brilliant title and a far-leftfield concept, there really isn't all that much to think about. It's an empty, abrupt, stupid, yet inexplicably magnetic, time capsule. A short, simple novelty at the best of times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"There's always room for Jell-O..." Vintage ad copy becomes end-times prophesy when a growing globule takes on a small American town, and it's up to a few teenagers to raise the warning. But will the adults listen?"The Blob" is a fun nostalgia ride that tells a good story, less about the horror than about the struggle of young people trying to do something about it. The title monster has some chilling scenes, though its slow movement and the cheap period special effects make it more a curio than anything frightening. Where "The Blob" succeeds is as a portrait of small-town life, and of young people trying to come to grips with something they don't understand.Or as the story's hero puts it: "How do you get people to protect themselves from something they don't believe in?" Two 1960s icons check in here. Burt Bacharach provides the catchy title melody, his first of many hit songs for movies. More significantly, Steve McQueen shows up in his first lead role as the hero, Steve Andrews. He plays the role with many of the practiced ticks and mannerisms pioneered by James Dean, but like Dean also showcases real screen presence and charisma.The same goes for the rest of the cast, consisting largely of regional stage actors and bit-part movie actors. Even though they are far from polished, they work to sell the homey nature of our setting and its characters. Credit director Irvin Yeaworth, a maker of religious films who made this to help fund his other endeavors, for giving his players the room to work their own personalities into the production, rather than trying to turn it into another Hollywood spectacle.As someone with a fondness for the Eisenhower years, I get a kick out of the cool cars Steve and his buddies drive, the sense of ready community spirit, midnight movies, kissing under the stars, and the corny, good- spirited humor. Sure, everyone seems to be white here, but it was shot in Pennsylvania, so even that kind of works.The monster does have its moments, too. The opening scene when old-timer Olin Howland finds the meteor and the thing inside it still packs a punch, as does his later demise. When "The Blob" came out, 40-year- veteran screen actor Howland might have been its most recognizable player, but that doesn't stop Yeaworth, like Hitchcock in "Psycho," from giving his star an early exit.The middle is where it gets too fuzzy. Having made his big entrance, the monster disappears for a long interval, perhaps to field press questions or sign an endorsement deal with some cooking-spray company. The focus draws more on the kids, which is okay in that you care about them and enjoy their company (especially that of McQueen and leading lady Aneta Corsaut) but debilitating in terms of building on the early suspense. While the disbelieving-adult angle is worthwhile, too much energy is spent on non-credible elements like a police sergeant who insists Steve is pulling a "gag" when talking about seeing the town doctor killed. As a McQueen fan, I enjoy seeing the star playing a more sympathetic version of what would become his trademark man of action rather than words. Sure, he wasn't a teenager like the character he played, but he's effective all the same. He has a couple of terrific scenes with Corsaut, where he tries to convince both of them of what he saw. I also get a kick of a bit where the future "King Of Cool" is coronated by his teenage buddies for beating them in a drag race. They even crown his head with a hubcap, like they traveled forward in time and saw "Bullitt" before shooting this scene."The Blob" is padded in other ways, but fortunately its only 82 minutes, and a harrowing conclusion manages to overcome sloppy animation as well as the wobbly build-up. Mostly for the nostalgia and McQueen, but also a few other things, "The Blob" is worth your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Opening with a saxophone-punctuated, little jazz/pop ditty (penned by Burt Bacharach) containing lyrics that go like this - "Beware of the blob! It creeps and leaps and glides and slides across the floor...." - You can bet that this super-schlocky, 1950s, teen, Sci-Fi/Horror flick is guaranteed to deliver (in all of its dead-seriousness) a literal score of priceless, unintentional laughs from start to finish.And laughs it certainly does produce - Even before the big-bad blob, in all of its gelatinous, cherry-colored glory, makes its first gooey screen-appearance.From its hilariously dumb dialog, to its totally wooden performances, to its goofy, low-budget special effects - The Blob is sure to please any hardcore fan of 1950s, B-movie junk. You can bet on that.I mean, how can you possibly go wrong with such wacky highlights that include the blob (growing bigger by the minute) attacking a petrified nurse in Dr. Hallen's office and the blob (now even bigger and meaner than you could ever imagine) invading the local movie theater during a midnight movie show, causing the piercing screams of sheer panic and horrified mayhem to prevail at full-throttle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tailor-Made for the Local Drive-In on a Saturday Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two young adults named "Steve Andrews" (Steve McQueen) and "Jane Martin" (Aneta Corsaut) are star-gazing late at night on the outskirts of town when they see what appears to be a meteor hit the earth not far from where they are parked. An old man living out in the woods also hears the meteor impact and goes to investigate. He finds what appears to be a large spoor of some kind and upon further inspection happens to get a gooey substance from the spoor on his hand. As the substance begins to grow the old man runs screaming into the road where Steve and Jane just happen to be driving. Realizing that he is in a great deal of pain they put him into the back of their car and race to the doctor's office in town. But even there the substance continues to grow and has now developed an insatiable appetite which threatens the entire town. Anyway, rather than divulge the entire story, I will just say that this was a movie produced back in the 50's which was tailor-made for the local drive-in on a Saturday night. Obviously, the special effects are extremely primitive by today's standards and the script was a little corny at times. Well, maybe more than a "little" corny. But this is still an entertaining movie all the same and I recommend it to those who are capable of making allowances.</fullReview>

A typical story of 50s SF... a meteor falls down in... America of course, it is actually a protoplasmic blob and it's hungry! And guess what, blob's favorite food is human flesh, wow... Of course, police would not believe a bunch of young kids, so the blob will spread and made a disaster in the small town. I found this film entertaining, funny and unusual. Why is that? Because it is pretty rare, the rare idea for a large jelly mass to spread all over and eats everything in it's path... We usually have monsters, giant insects... all that stuff... but a large jelly blob? No way! It's interesting that the sequel was released in 1971, but, it didn't do any good. This one is better.

One of the main ones here is due to the consistently irritating efforts of the film to stay with the teens and their lifestyle that serve almost no entertainment value since I don't enjoy that lifestyle at all, leaving the beginning to feel way too slowed down and convoluted, having to jump back into the plot almost an after-thought the way it's so clumsily handled because they're showcasing the teens rather than keeping the story moving. The attacks, though, are a lot of fun and generate some good suspense and action, particularly the finale in the diner where it seems to spread everywhere and resulting in lots of ways to go at the being, so it does save itself some particular points that way, but it could've had a lot more with a bit of reworking.Today's Rating/PG: Violence</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jello Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A horror film that is both goofy and strangely terrifying. One has to wonder about what the Creator/Deity was thinking when The Blob was made. What kind of world did it come from? When it's in it's normal habitat what does The Blob feed on? When you think about it The Blob is your ultimate doomsday weapon.The soon to be legend Steve McQueen got his first starring role in The Blob, a 28 year old playing a teen who is out getting down to business with Aneta Corsaut when a passing meteor lands, cracks open, and out pops this Jello like creature which just absorbs whatever is living around it on contact and just grows. In the end it is covering your average greasy spoon diner with McQueen, Corsaut, and others inside.Most of the film is McQueen trying to warn folks about it with the help of Corsaut. Of course the adults, especially law enforcement don't believe him after all he's a typical Eisenhower era teen with girls and hotrods on his mind. In fact in the middle of a mission, he takes time for a little drag race.But it's Steve who actually discovers the secret of if not killing The Blob at least rendering it helpless and inert. McQueen was paid $2500.00 for the film, in two years that might have paid for one of his entourage.The Blob was the farewell film of character actor Olin Howlin who usually played rustic types in a couple hundred films. He's The Blob's first victim that McQueen and Corsaut discover.After over 50 years still an interesting and camp film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is difficult to work out if this movie is an anti-communist movie or not but what I do get out of it is the theme of beware of the invisible enemy. The blob does not deal with an alien intelligence taking control of people's minds and forcing to the work against their will, but rather with a sleepy town that does not realise that a monster has descended upon them.The blob opens with a meteorite hitting the earth near a town. A vagrant finds it and is attack by a blob. He is taken to the hospital where the doctor tries to work out what it is only to be killed by it as well. The only people who see this creature are a couple of high school kids which nobody really wants to believe. The movie mostly involves with the kids trying to make the town aware of this creature before it is too powerful to be destroyed.I was wondering what the small town symbolised and realised that it is an unprepared America. America has sworn never to be unprepared like it was in World War II. As such they are making sure that they are ready for any assault. The town here symbolises America in that it is asleep and it needs to be woken. The blob is the communist threat. It begins small and insignificant and quicklt grows to a point where it is unstoppable. In the end it can only be halted and not destroyed. It must be sent to the Arctic where it will grow no bigger and be monitered.America is warning the people to be prepared for if they remain asleep the communist threat will be too big for them to deal with. The blob is red, which is the traditional colour for communism. Whether this is purposeful or unintentional I do not know, but it is interesting that the monster is of a reddish colour which would make people think instantly of communism. The traditional colours of freedom are red, white, and blue, for liberty, equality, and fraternity (stolen from the French Revolution) but for international communism, which the United States feared greatly, is red.The Blob was a reasonable movie but the whole propaganderous ideas that sink through this movie really cause me to turn from it. I don't hate it though because I like movies where I can pull things out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a pretty well known one so i won't get too deep into it. The basic story is about two teens who find out about a slimy alien blob of goo that arrives to earth via meteor. Human contact with this slime ball burns through flesh like acid. It also absorbs human bodies making it grow bigger. Nobody believes the teens (Steeve McQueen and his girlfriend) and when they finally do it seems that the blob can't be stopped. It's really well done for it's age and unlike a lot of other 50's flicks the pace is pretty fast. The story is very unique making it and a must see for any fan of old sci-fi and monster movies.

		<fullReview>I just watched "The Blob" for the first time, having been too young at the time to catch it at a local drive-in or movie theater. Holy cow, what a blast, owing to the goofy pseudo sci-fi horror effects and Steve McQueen in an early starring film role. Although by 1958, he was well past being a teenager, and it showed in those close-ups with crease lines already showing up on his forehead. Then to top it off, there was a fairly entertaining 'Blob' theme song to open the picture which made me wonder why it wasn't ever released as a single. It was the same year after all, as Sheb Wooley's 'Purple People Eater' and the tune seemed to be just as catchy.I got a kick out of the theatrical trailer on the Criterion Collection DVD that mentioned the film 'starring Steve McQueen and a cast of exciting young people'. All throughout the flick it drove me crazy where I might have seen Steve's girl friend Jane before, until I discovered that she was Andy Taylor's girlfriend on the 'Andy Griffith Show'. The rest of the exciting young people didn't make much of a dent beyond the opening scenes where Steve seems to upstage a trio of hot rod buddies, then has to talk his way out of a jam with Lieutenant Dave. Funny, but I remember seeing Olin Howlin in a picture a while ago, noteworthy because he played Roy Rogers' sidekick in a Western called "Apache Rose". He was an old timer in that flick too almost a dozen years earlier. He got things rolling as the Blob's first victim, looking a bit like a disheveled Lloyd Bridges and setting the stage for all the rest of the gruesome fun to follow. Besides the story, the film is a great time capsule reminder of life during a simpler time, when watermelon cost four cents a pound, and twenty nine cents got you two bottles of catsup (today it's ketchup). Then there was Tony lamenting that he just wasted eighty cents at the all night spook show, but was that for one ticket or two? Either way, it makes you long for those good old days when all seemed right with the world when you weren't battling space monsters or doing 'duck and cover' drills.If you remember the ending, the Blob was frozen and whisked away to the North Pole to remain in permanent hibernation, 'as long as the Arctic stays cold'. Although there was a 'Blob' re-make in 1988 and sort of a sequel with 1972's "Beware! The Blob", today might just be the right time to put together a follow up; what with all the global warming hysteria it would be a natural. As an added bonus, maybe they could film it in a way that might have made the original even more camp - in glorious black and white.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far one of the most likable monster flicks I've ever seen. Whenever I'm feeling down, I can always count on "The Blob" to cheer me up. People complain about the film being too campy and not seeming to make enough attempts to scare the audience. So? This is film isn't meant to be taken too seriously and is in turn one of the funnest films ever made. Up to this day, "The Blob" remains one of the greatest cult classics of it's era.The legendary monster is a mass of jello that comes from outer space on a meteorite. It lands in a small town and is witnessed by a pack of teenagers. The monster proceeds to kill several residents and grow in size which each death. However, the authorities take little note. The hero of the film, Steve, and his girlfriend are the only ones who seem to be worried about the monster and attempt to warn the ignorant townsfolk of the beast. They ignore his warnings until it is too late and the Blob has grown to massive proportions.Is it a masterpiece like "Citizen Kane"? No, but that's because it isn't meant to be such. It's supposed to be a goofy drive-in flick, and it succeeds admirably as entertainment. Several aspects show this to be a smarter flick than it may appear on the surface. Some folks don't seem to be able to understand the sense of humor that wasn't prevalent in most films from the era. The goofy theme song by Burt Bacharach and the references to other films show this was ahead of its time. In addition to the humor, it can be quite chilling occasionally. The scene at the beginning of the death of the old man, even though tame by today's standards, is quite graphic for the time.What ultimately makes the film work for me are the likable characters. Sure, they aren't well developed in the slightest sense, but you start to root for them as opposed to the monster (which is often the case). Also, the teenagers aren't presented as delinquents or idiots which is often the case with films like this. The idea of the teens saving the day in the end has become a common element for horror films ever since.It's easy to criticize a film like this as there are many flaws present. The acting and the screenplay are obviously done by inexperienced folks. However, this film is fast-paced and entertaining despite the inanity. Criterion recognized this as an important film and gave it a DVD treatment most highbrow films will never see. This is still one of the greatest cult classics, and an all around fun film.

I tell you the people, I watched the main screen repeat in this one about 35 times. It was awesome. A cinematic tapestry of cascading brilliance that had me from where it was, which was the very beginning. Many times the sum and Bam! I was hooked. Over and over and over. And over."Doot de doot, de doo de dodedo." And that's just the soundtrack! I is laid aside in the bed, curled up with my Vaio. The rain is in the flat roof and tonight soft is again soft. The cat is comfortable and my ankle which crosses in me, is already rested. I popped in the DVD. I was mesmerized. Through the night. "doot de doot, de doo de dodedo."The Blob. See it. Steve Queen, two cops, and one girl in a dress. Two thumbs way up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here's another Horror classic in the books!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Old horror movies are interesting, plenty of screams, plenty of shouts, and plenty of humor to go along with it. "The Blob" is a classic in it's own work. Steve McQueen(1930-80) plays a teen who tries to be a hero in his town. Going out on a date with his girl is rather typical for all teens. But when the old man discovers the same falling object form the sky, he ends up being the victim, and Steve helps him out the best he can. When its up to teen power, this movie really provides it. I know most teens have had their hardships when they act up, when danger comes around, they must learn to forget the past and start doing something good to save humanity. When the adults in town ended up learn the hard way about "The Blob" running amok, they must learn to trust teenagers and not let their behavior get the better of them. The oozing juggernaut was rather cute in the day, and in my opinion I think it was JELL-O! When everyone pitches in to stop the menace, the town is once again safe, thanks to good old cooperation. I still eat Jello and watch this movie all the time, if you don't like Jello, TOUGH! RATING 5 STARS</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no issue so big I cannot straddle it.Like a previous commentator I too saw THE BLOB as a double with MARRIED A MONSTER just before Christmas 1958. A sensitive child even at thirteen, it scared the hell out of me, and more so my younger tag-along brother. Ten years later I saw it on television -- understanding the marked difference in setting -- and wondered, bemused, why my early adolescent self found it so terrifying.Part of the effect, as one Hitchcockian commentator said, was not knowing when it would "jump" out at one, what it was up to. Yes, suspense is more potent than always having the horror rubbed in one's face. See ALIEN (1979). Some of the "action," as it is politely called to-day, was shown indirectly, indistinctly. All of the banalities, the drag race, the fussing with parents, somehow heightened my fear. (Yes, a timid boy.)I make no judgement about the "effects," not being an "effects" zombie. The acting was serviceable for a 'teen movie of the 1950s, at least to my recollection from 1967 or '8, but at that latter day Steve(n) McQueen definitely did carry it off as a teen-ager.THE BLOB is a good period piece, a horror film with a s.f. gloss to give it legs. In recent decades the very last scene would have been a naked pitch for a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, corny, campy fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic of science fiction, and probably the most original monster to appear on film, The Blob continues to entertain today over forty years after its release. No explanation is given as to what the blob is actually made of (other than being from a meteorite) or how it moves, but this isn't necessary to enjoy this film. We see the creature grow from about golf ball size to large enough to cover a diner after devouring a large number of persons, many of them off screen. The teenagers trying to get the police to believe the existence of the blob and an increasing number of people vanishing makes this seem like almost a detective story at times, which makes for a nice variety in the movie's theme.This is not a movie to be taken seriously; the film is well made and not a parody, but there are no hidden meanings or major social commentary here and it is simply a good piece of science fiction. Sit back and enjoy it for what it is - you'll like it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grab some Jello and settle down with The Blob.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You remember The Blob (1958), it's the movie that you mom and dad told you scared them so much at the drive-in theatre. This is the film that starred the then-unknown "Stevie McQueen" in his first starring role. This is also the film where they do battle against a swelling chunk of cherry Jello and try to prevent it from taking over the small town. Well, it still is very enjoyable. From cardboard cutout movie scenes to little boys in pajamas shooting capguns at the girth, The Blob still rocks and it's worth a spot in your horror collection. This 86 minute classic also had Burt Bacharach doing the funky opening song that you'll find yourself humming days after you've rewound the tape. Our recommendation is simple; if you didn't get a chance to see this film years ago (or when it was new) grab some Jello and settle down with The Blob.</fullReview>

Then in 1970, I found myself working the very same county as a rookie PA state trooper. I have always enjoyed checking out the different places where scenes were filmed. I knew the owner of the Downingtown Diner well, and he had a road sign out front which told all passing motorists that this was the "home of the blob". The theater scene was in Phoenixville, near Valley Forge Park and it is still showing films today!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good idea that was done well,............for it's time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Blob" is an interesting creature. It's not like any other creature cinema history has ever seen. It doesn't have a skeletal structure. It doesn't have a face, and it doesn't have a body (a specific figure). So the question in mind, is how does a group of filmmakers and special effects artists make this idea a reality. The answer was just being innovative and creative. And for the amount of technology that was available at the time, it was an astounding feat.Starring as the hero (if that's what he really is) is Steve McQueen. McQueen plays an ordinary teenager who ends up running into The Blob and notices the horror that it causes. Honestly, calling McQueen's character a hero or an ordinary teenager is hard to say. The plot of this story runs at a slow pace and much of it is focused on how McQueen tries to convince people that he's not hallucinating. There's not much of any character development at all really. As for the other characters involved in this story, there isn't much to talk about because much of the dialog is bland and sluggish.What stands out from that however, is The Blob creature itself. To watch this creature on screen is intriguing enough to wonder how the film crew could have gotten this to work so well. The Blob truly does slink and slush its way around in this film. It's almost like Jell-O but filmed in slow motion. Unfortunately, the fun really doesn't begin until the film enters its finale. The way that "fun" is used in the previous statement describes what it's like to watch The Blob move in every scene, not the death scenes of its victims.What was most disappointing about this film was how little The Blob was in every scene. Sure it's fun seeing what it can do but wouldn't viewers want to see more? They probably never did. Adding to this was the fact that the death scenes did not even last long on screen. It is to the assumption the reason why the film was no graphic was due to the generation it was released to. This can be understood but it still can be frustrating. Surely someone would be thinking, "So what happened to the victim? Can't we see what happened?". As for the musical score, which was produced by Ralph Carmichael, has a nice tone to whatever scene is currently happening. The only song I have in question is the one at the opening credits. Why so jolly sounding?As the first of a couple "blob" films, this one isn't a masterpiece but it is something worth admiring for even if the part worth admiring is relatively small. Somehow though, if this movie wasn't about The Blob, this story ultimately would have been left in the refrigerator where it belonged.</fullReview>

Notice how much fun this man-made booger is, very tactile, sticky, and a smidge icky. I think that's why 1958's The Blob is such a fun B movie, along with lots of earnest performances (although Steve McQueen and his girl friend, who I remember from The Andy Griffith Show, are supposed to be high schoolers, and are pushing thirty very hard), a genuinely ingenious and gracefully simple plot, and a feeling that here's absolutely nothing inappropriate to watch here, unless you find dumping a deadly space organism at the North Pole to be environmentally irresponsible.At which point you should lighten up and go play with some boogers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>interesting ... not just for the early appearance of an icon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Several major stars and directors began their film careers in the mass of sci-fi and horror B-movies churned out in the 1950s and early 1960s. Clint Eastwood was featured as a lab technician in "Revenge of the Creature" (1955) and as one of the pilots zapping the vast spider with napalm in "Tarantula" (1955). Jack Nicholson's early credits include "The Little Shop of Horrors" (1961), "The Raven" (1962), and "The Terror" (1962). Early appearances of cinematic icons are always fascinating, but "The Blob" not only features Steve McQueen's third screen role, and second as a star, but remains one of the great cheap horror films. The smallness of the budget is betrayed by the few special effects sequences and their basicness when they do come, featuring an amorphous mass of red jelly. It is a horror film of enduring charm, and one that almost entirely neglects to be horrifying. McQueen's quiet, slow-burn performance is already formed, but he is also clearly mimicking the screen techniques of his late contemporary, James Dean.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Teen Squad Jam Sandwich.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw THE BLOB as a young kid, it was terrifying. I didn't care about the tepid acting, the simple, linear storyline, and especially didn't notice any subtexts of Sex=Death, or Not All American Teen Hooligans Are Bad. And who the hell was Steve McQueen? Now, well, the pulsing strawberry jelly representing the inexplicable entity from outer space looks like The Horror From Pepperidge Farm. And while somewhere, an acting coach is weeping inconsolably, the message of Not All Teens Are Bad can be embraced, considering the "teen" leader was the King Of Cool in his first starring role, 28-year-old Steve McQueen.A meteorite plummets to Earth in the countryside; an old codger pokes at it and a gelatinous gloop covers his hand. "Teens" Steve (McQueen) and Jane (Aneta Corsaut, beyond bland) find the delirious old man when the gloop has overtaken his arm, and rush him to a doctor (Stephen Chase) who looks uncannily like George Reeves as Clark Kent. Unfortunately he ain't no Superman and is swallowed by the blob after some menial overacting.And in respect for his body of future work, we pretend we don't notice young Mr. McQueen's Acting School Terrified Look as he sees the doc get blobbed.The growing blob of matter slimes around town undercover of night, swallowing various extras and growing with each kill, while the town "teens" (Steve and his hooligan buddies, all dressed neatly in collared shirts and high pants) cook up dangerous stunts like driving backwards, sneaking out of their bedrooms at night, investigating an abandoned house and going to see a "spooky movie." Those crazy kids! The special effects of the day are rudimentary, yet effective; though relying heavily on quick edits and process shots, director Irvin S. Yeaworth Jr. creates a very plausible horror with Bobby Blobby's soundless subsuming of sweetmeats.As hard as it may be to fear something with the texture of strawberry jam, THE BLOB could have been a truly terrifying thriller, rather than a breezy cult novelty, as the formless, mindless eponymous entity is never explained, and therefore scarier than any axe-murderer or scientific experiment gone awry. It was not consciously malevolent, just trying to find energy sources, although I know the simple-headed movie makers were not trying to be that subtle, and painted it as a basic evil villain. We imagine but for cooler heads prevailing, they would have put a twirling mustache on it.But the ominous tone is shunted aside to cater to the social mores of the day - the Teen Movement; the blob itself becomes merely a device for the Teens to overcome. THE WILD ONE (1953), REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE (1955), DADDY-O (1958), THE REBEL SET (1959), THE BEATNIKS (1960) - the plots of these movies (and scores of others produced during this period) revolved around Wild Teens as the simultaneous outcasts and drivers of society. This synergy informs THE BLOB and its portrayal of mid-American society as a hapless bunch of inbreeds with Teens Saving The World.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK science fiction, has good atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is camp science fiction, and unlike what people are led to believe, that wasn't really a sign of the times. There has always been a mixture of this sort and the serious sort. Nowadays, people just readily accept vampires and other creatures as "fact". A blob lands on Earth via meteorite, beginning as a small one celled creature, but it becomes an ever growing amoeba that just digests every organic creature it comes across. It isn't intelligent. It just rolls along and eats people. Certainly the basis for an entertaining low brow movie. Fortunatelly, the director doesn't overkill the boring drag race scenes. Instead, he focuses on the camaraderie between the young hooligans who try to convince the authorities that there is a blob. The McQueen character is not really an outcast. He is even respected by the leaders of the authorities, and no doubt they expect him to join their private clubs some day. He is no outcast by any means. The other juveniles, most of whom breeze through rather anonymously, are more likable, and give the movie the amiable atmosphere that makes it enjoyable. It would not make sense to have such an atmosphere of people working together in today's world. And I wouldn't expect the stubborn mule heads of today's America to learn from it. Be honest. Our society prides itself on the same stubborn, non compromising qualities of eighteen hijackers of 9-11. The same qualities of these fanatics is what we call "leadership" in Americans. There is no working together, and the B movie science fiction of pre 1970 thrived on this atmosphere. Today's atmosphere is not worth any atmosphere. That it is the problem with making such a movie in today's time. To witness the loyalties of people from another time is heartening, and gives this movie an edge. That said, the remake was a good movie, and compared well with this. I'm not sure I can call one better than the other, but many people will have an opinion. I'm not so sure that either one will overwhelm the other in popularity. You'll probably like this movie somewhat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Caught this last night - having not seen it in years. Again this hails from a time when there was not much critical demand for perfection in acting, f/x and storyline. But this adds to the more creepier aspects of the film. The earlier scenes are the best with the old man, the doctor/nurse and the general hysteria Steve McQueen generates. When you watch the film you can see where the remake (in true remake fashion) pulled from the story and characters. The little boy is present, the diner and the of course Dave the chief of police. A pleasant and innocence drive-in movie from a by-gone era.Enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Take This Film Too Seriously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read many comments on this site criticizing The Blob for being cheesy and or campy. The movie has been faulted for amateurish acting and weak special effects. What would you expect from a group of folks whose only experience has been in the production of low budget, locally produced (Valley Forge PA) Christian Shorts. Let me tell those overly critical reviewers that this film never took itself all that serious. That fact should be evident from the mismatched theme music complete with silly lyrics played over the opening credits. For what it was meant to be, this film is excellent. I have seen a few of the recent ultra low budget attempts, Blair Witch Project was one of them, that have absolutely no entertainment value or intelligent thought behind their plot. BWP was pure excrement. The Blob, on the other hand, was well thought out, well scripted, and thoroughly entertaining. The scene where the old man comes across the meteorite and pokes the mass contained within with a stick was excellently done and genuinely creepy. The scene in the doctor's office with the Blob slowly moving under the blanket on the gurney while it consumed the old man was a cinematic horror masterpiece. Bottom line is, I love this movie. I challenge anyone out there to take $120,000.00, inflated for today's dollar value, and make a film anywhere near as entertaining and or as successful as the Blob. It just can't be done. PERIOD!

		<shortDescription>The Blob</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard the title of this cult classic many times, I knew it had a big star in the leading role, and I knew a little about the concept, it became a big hit in drive-in theatres, it is even shown at a drive- in in the film Grease, so I had to see what it was all about. Basically teenagers Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen) and his girlfriend Jane Martin (Aneta Corseaut) see a meteorite crash nearby and go to investigate, an Old Man (Olin Howland) finds it first, he pokes it with a stick and the small rock cracks open, releasing an alien jelly-like blob, which attaches itself to his hand. Steve and Jane find the Old Man and take him to the Dr. T. Hallen (Stephen Chase), he has no idea what it is, he sends Steve and Jane back to the crash site to gather more evidence, before the doctor can amputate the man's arm with the unknown lifeform, it has already consumed the man and grown bigger. The Blob also consumes Kate the Nurse (Lee Payton), and Steve and Jane return in time to witness the doctor's death, they dash to the police station to report what they have seen to Lieutenant Dave (Earl Rowe) and Sergeant Bert (John Benson), but there is no evidence of the creature or the victims, Bert dismisses Steve's story as a prank. Meanwhile the Blob grows every time it consumes something, it next consumes a repair shop mechanic, Steve and Jane have snuck out and want Tony (Robert Fields) and other friends to warn the people about the menace. The townspeople and police refuse to believe Steve, but the Blob soon appears again, entering the Colonial Theater, consuming the projectionist and members of the auditorium audience, Steve is vindicated as people flee the theatre and the alien ooze comes out. Steve, Jane and Danny hide in a diner, and along with the manager, waitresses and customers are trapped by the Blob engulfing the building, a fire begins and the manager gets a CO2 fire extinguisher to put it out, Steve notices that the Blob being caught by the cold air makes it recoil. Communicating to the people outside, Steve on the radio tells the police that the Blob is vulnerable to cold, so people head to the school and get many more CO2 extinguishers to spray onto the creature. In the end the Blob has reduced in size due to the cold of the CO2, the Lieutenant requests the Air Force send an aircraft to transport the Blob to the Arctic, the Lieutenant says it presumably cannot be killed, but the cold temperatures will stop it returning, Steve replies "Yeah, as long as the Arctic stays cold" (very relevant in today's world where global warming is a big issue). Also starring George Karas as Officer Ritchie, Elbert Smith as Henry Martin, Hugh Graham as Mr. Andrews, Vincent Barbi as George - Cafe Owner and Audrey Metcalf as Elizabeth Martin. McQueen obviously became a big star following this, he gives an alright performance as the concerned teenager, this is a quintessential 1950s film, it is taking everything completely seriously, you cannot deny the script, acting and overall premise is absolutely lame, and the opening Burt Bacharach and Mack David written title song is a little psychedelic, but it is unsettling cheesy fun, and it spawned a successful 1988 remake, overall its an alright independent science-fiction drama. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blobbing along</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic of a long forgotten era. I remember watching this a very young boy on a tiny portable TV later than I should have been awake. I watched this film as I was developing my love of horror films and I think I was lucky because the films of eras gone by were still remembered with fondness at your local video rental shops - which saying alone makes me feel old. Films like this may only be available on a tiny handful of satellite horror TV channels now, once in a blood moon, but as a young boy I remember been drawn to the front cover of the VHS alone while perusing the video rental place. When I actually got around to watching the film I was awestruck and amazed at how tacky and rickety it was, and I loved it. The acting was wooden, the set was questionable and the effects were far from special, but I respected this film. It was from an era that produced some of the finest classic black and white films and compared to other horror movies of the time it holds it's own. By today's standards it's an embarrassment but I'm remembering this with rose tinted glasses because I respect the time it was made, I respect what it looked like and you know what, it's one of the originals. Let's face it, you recognise Steve McQueen and he is in fact the central vehicle to the film. While out with his girlfriend he stumbles across a meteorite which has crashed to earth and has unleashed a dangerous killer blob of alien (or alien goo). The blob manages to makes it's way through town, eating (or disintegrating) the populous. Nobody believe Steve McQueen because he's one of the small town's young cool(ish) men with a car. As events unfold the town slowly begin to believe him and the other cool kids but will they be able to save themselves and the town in time? This B-Movie Horror film has probably been watched millions of times and it's survived remakes and it still stands the test of time as an all time classic. If you haven't seen or heard of this go and find a copy... in fact no, if you haven't seen this just shame on you sir, shame on you madam.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pedestrian direction does nothing to mar a monster movie classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This cult '50s classic has many things to recommend it, not least a leading man in Steve McQueen, here appearing before he was famous. This is everything you could want and expect from a monster movie, and although it follows a strict formula, that formula was still fresh and exciting when this movie was made. Any disadvantages of the low budget are dispelled by the glorious Technicolour that this movie was shot in, giving it a colourful look. Although the direction is pedestrian, the script has an appealing air of the tongue in cheek about it to keep things entertaining and a fair smattering of out-and-out comedy also helps.From the moment we here Burt Bacarach's opening theme song "beware of the blob!" we know we're in for a good, solid, campy and light hearted movie and this is refreshingly free of the scientific investigation/jargon that tended to bog movies of this era down. The leads are all teenagers, meaning that those stuffy officials are kept to a minimum, and those that do appear are pretty good too - for example, Jim the cop, who has illusions of persecution! McQueen is refreshingly brave in the leading role, even if his acting is a bit erratic and unconvincing at times. The supporting actors are excellent, especially the guy playing Dave, a sympathetic policeman. The only exception to this statement is the annoyingly cute boy whose acting is atrocious.The special effects of the blob rolling down the street and eating people are well done, with even a couple of moments of horror (like when McQueen sees the doctor being dissolved through his window) thrown in for good measure. Sadly the animation used at the end is highly unconvincing, ruining what could have been a solid ending and instead making it look a bit rushed and weak. It would take nearly thirty years for them to remake this movie (again as THE BLOB) and improve upon the effects here, although I'll stand by what I've said in that they more than hold up for this type of movie! Fans can also enjoy a witty bit of self-referencing in which the blob attacks members of a cinema audience (a year before THE TINGLER did the same) who are themselves watching a schlocky horror film. THE BLOB may be predictable but it's a lot of fun, and the solid acting keeps you watching. It's a rare film from the '50s that actually WANTS you to laugh at the title menace instead of the humour coming unintentionally. Altogether, this is a childhood favourite of mine that thankfully stands up as good fun at an adult level, is very nearly on equal with the excellent remake and is one of the most campy movies I've seen. Check it out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Today, this movie is still entertaining enough to watch during a cardio session in the gym. One watches classic B horror movies movie knowing that one can't possibly be scared - not after the gore we have been fed over the years. The only tingle down my spine was just sweat from the exercise. What really spoiled this movie for me was that Steve Mc Queen looked way too old to play a 17 year old ( I checked he was 28). He looked utterly ridiculous saying 'Yes Pa' when he was grounded (!) and needing a window to go out of the house. The 3 policemen in the station must the friendliest bunch in the history of American movie making. If policemen were that friendly in those days - we must have taken a wrong turning somewhere. The blob itself looked as menacing as a frisky puppy bobbing up and down - all it was missing was a tail to wag. When extruding through vents and under doors it was more creepy - I think that would have definitely have scared me if I was younger.I suspect some people did get injured during the crowd stampede scene, which seemed to escalate out of hand into reality. Watch it for historical reasons: the 50's cars, teens and suburbia, Polio posters, proper girls, crooked teeth, chess games, black &amp; white movie theaters . . . different planet!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe because McQueen went on to be such a big star, perhaps because it was seen by many as kids on afternoon T.V.; but "The Blob" has become a favorite of many, the defining film of it's type. And that really too bad, because "The Blob" really stinks. Tedious, amateurish, poorly executed at every level. In one scene (due to the connection to producer Jack B. Harris) the audience is laughing at John Parker's fascinating "Daughter Of Horror" and one wants to gag at this derision for a vastly superior film. It's like watching every cliché of Drive-In teenage movies, and no doubt that is also why people like it. But it's like watching those clichés played in slow motion with no with and style. Which makes me suspicious this is the favorite of this sort of thing for people who really don't like this sort of thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Blob has been described as an allegory for the creeping influences of communism during the cold war by high handed critics but it's probably best appreciated for what it is; a low budged 1950s B movie. Hollywood tough guy Steve McQueen is cast here as an 'aw, shucks' teenager who tries to warn his sleepy town elders that a carnivorous blob from outer space is on the loose, devouring anyone who gets too close. The catchy Burt Bacharach theme song was a minor hit and The Blob was followed by Beware, The Blob in 1972 and a remake in 1988. The Blob has a lot of charm and appeal even after all these years and the special effects are fairly good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated but worth watching for Steve McQueen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those classic sci-fi films from the 50's which is unusual in that it's lead actor turned into the biggest star of his generation. In fact without McQueen this film would probably be long forgotten. It is clear that he is head and shoulders above anybody else in this. The story is standard and you don't exactly get any surprises. The blob is pretty laughable though bearing in mind how old the film is, this is to be expected. For me the film doesn't really garner enough tension to be really memorable though to be fair the later scenes do liven things up. I suppose if I were watching this back in 1958 it would be considerably better however even allowing for this, The Blob isn't a great film just merely decent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An alien life form consumes everything in its path as it grows and grows.All in all, the film has pretty decent special effects for the time. Maybe it is just silicone or a weather balloon, but the blob is a convincingly frightening creature...Steve McQueen was said to be a jerk to work with, a real pain in the butt. If he was anything like the character he plays, I would completely agree. I love that although this is one of his earlier roles, he already looks middle-aged and rough...According to Jeff Sharlet in his book The Family, The Blob was "about the creeping horrors of communism" only defeated "by freezing it ? the Cold War writ small and literal." This is an interesting bit of intellectual baloney -- a metaphor that works but was clearly never intended by the people involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Blob</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I need more, as I like to call them, "fluff" in my life. What do I mean by fluff? I mean movies that are cheesy, fun, a project that may not be a Citizen Kane or a Return of the King or a Empire Strikes Back, but something that was made to do what I believe movies are ultimately made for,to entertain. The Blob is that fluffy entertainment.I went into this movie, only with the knowledge that this is a "cult- classic" and is part of the pretty prestigious, Criterion library. So, what a surprising treat it was to see Steve McQueen as the star of this flick. If anything is a guaranteed plus in this movie, it's his performance. He plays, kind of, the typical teen that you would see in every horror movie. But this is Steve McQueen, he brings a realness and a believable presence to his character. He tries his hardest to warn his small town from the horrors of the title monster and really take his side. The rest of the cast is pretty decent for what they bring, but let's talk about star here, The Blob itself, or as it's referred to in the film, the mass. The film is over half a century old, and the gloppy SFX look as awesome as ever. Again, this isn't Avatar, but the blob effects mixed with the overall look of the movie give this film, a timeless look to me. From the costumes, to the color scheme of the town the movie takes place in. It's a very simple story, but the ride it takes you on is quite the roller coaster, all the way up to the classic climax which has me grinning from ear to ear. Taking place in a theater and seeing this massive group of extras running away from the slow moving terror, surprisingly, keeps replaying over and over in my mind. It's so B-movie, so campy. The score and especially the opening tune are also little pluses in one of the most fun movie experiences I've had watching a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steve McQueen plays Steve Andrews, who, along with his girlfriend Jane(played by Aneta Corsaut) are on a date when they find an old man who has come in contact with something on his hand. They take him to a doctor, but the thing on his hand has now spread, killing him. This thing(Blob) then proceeds to grow and kill, threatening the whole town. Only Steve and Jane, with the help of their fellow "teenagers" can warn the authorities, and save the town. Though this isn't a particularly good film, it is still a lot of fun, representing a sort of innocence in filmmaking that is long gone, a real time capsule picture. McQueen is good, and you can see why he became a star. Lots of nostalgia here!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1958's "The Blob" is still a quasi-classic of the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Blob" is chiefly remembered now for launching Steve McQueen's career. Soon after the release of this film, he was offered the role of Josh Randall on the hit TV series "Wanted: Dead or Alive," and super-stardom was only a few years away. Here, billed as "Steven" McQueen, he leads a pack of teenagers who are determined to stop the Blob from devouring their small town. The main problem is that the authorities (i.e. the local police) refuse to believe their story about a "monster" killing people and think it's all a "gag." Hatched from a meteor, the Blob itself (with the help of about $100 worth of Special Effects) is a magnified slab of Jell-O that looks like it's been leftover from yesterday's desert menu. As the film progresses, it gets bigger and bigger and is soon eating up whole buildings. The 28-year-old McQueen, who's supposed to be a teenager himself in the movie, is smart enough to figure out that this evil hunk of space glob can't stand low temperatures. In no time, everyone in town is bombarding it with CO-2 Fire Extinguishers and putting it into the deep freeze. The best scene in the film is when the Blob attacks the downtown theater during a midnight showing of monster movies and the panicking and screaming (actually smiling and laughing) crowd comes running out into the street."The Blob" was distributed by Paramount Pictures who quite rightly figured it would be a smash hit with teenagers and it certainly was all of that. Broke at the time, McQueen settled for a $3000 flat fee for his services although he was also offered 10% of the gross profits in lieu of any upfront money. That turned out to be a mistake. Also in the cast is Aneta Corsaut who later had a long career in television with co-starring roles on the "Andy Griffith Show" and "Matlock." McQueen, one of Hollywood's biggest movie stars of the 1960s and 1970s, died at the age of 50 in 1980. He was a one-of-a-kind actor and personality who marched to his own beat,to say the least. Late in his career, McQueen was asked about having any regrets and answered "I should have taken the offer for 10% of "The Blob."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lot Of Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's serious - but it's not too serious. In a way, this is a bit of a deep breath after many of the VERY serious alien invasion movies that were so common in the 1950's. The Blob is serious - it does have a scary alien creature that does in fact kill people - but it's also the quintessential example of what makes a movie "campy" - right from the very start with the very 50's and therefore very appropriate theme song, which gives it the dated, campy feel right away.The story is about a meteorite that falls to earth, and when it breaks open, out pops - well - a living blob of some sort that consumes people. As it consumes more and more it grows bigger and bigger until it's almost out of control. The heroes in this are a group of local teens (headed by Steven - note the "n" - McQueen) who encounter the blob but can't get anyone to take them seriously. So there's a bit of a "boy who cries wolf" theme going on here. I also thought there was perhaps a bit of a subtle political message about McCarthyism (this was the 50's after all) - as the blob swallows more and more people up (for no reason except that it exists to swallow people up) it grows bigger and bigger and gets more and more out of control - kind of like McCarthy? Maybe I'm reading too much into this, but the thought occurred to me.The story is pretty good, the cast is decent (although McQueen was a bit old for the part - he's playing a teen, but he was close to 30 when this was made) and it's wonderfully short (not even an hour and a half) and therefore very fast paced, making it even more enjoyable to watch. I know it was remade in 1988. I haven't seen the remake of it. I might be willing to take a look at the '88 version, but the thing with campy movies like this version of "The Blob" is that while you can recreate the story, you can never really recreate the campiness of it all. I'd highly recommend this. It's a lot of fun. (8/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This shoddy teen-age horror movie is done so ineptly in every respect that it's immensely entertaining.It isn't a question of what's wrong with it but of finding a short list of things that are right. I can't really make that list because it's precisely the wrong things that make it as interesting as it is.Everybody belongs to the Partridge family. In this small town, Dad runs the store while Mom stays home and keeps house and take care of the children. The high school gang we see are a little rambunctious but tidy and committed to the welfare of their community. The girls wear those flouncy skirts that have multiple petticoats. Extensive footage is lavished on the glossy period cars, especially McQueens sea green convertible. Nobody believes McQueen and his girl friend when they find an old man gradually being consumed by the blob from outer space. The blob grows and consumes other victims as well, as in "The Quatermass Experiment". But why go on? Here's an example of wasted footage or, if you like, wretched screen writing. McQueen and Girl have just dropped off the old man at the local doctor's office, after speeding him there in their convertible. Seeing McQueen's car zipping down the main street rouses the testosterone of some other high school jock types and they challenge McQueen to a race, driving backwards along one of the streets. The police chief, Dave, stops McQueen and questions him sarcastically. Just exactly what did McQueen think he was doing? McQueen squirms in the driver's seat. He purses his lips, looks puzzled while trying to cook up a plausible excuse for driving at full speed backward. He squints, he rubs his forehead. The cop continues with his interrogation. "Do you realize you're in the wrong lane?" And so on -- for five full minutes, while back at the doc's office the blob is eating everybody in sight but has been completely forgotten for the sake of a few 1958 chuckles from the teen-aged audience it was aimed at. When the cop releases the couple, they are stopped by the other tidy high schoolers and thoroughly joshed by them -- for another four or five minutes, while back at the doc's office the blob consumes the doctor himself, the nurse, the medical equipment, the Norman Rockwell painting on the wall, the left-over Chinese take out, and a chilled bottle of Michelob Lite in the refrigerator. All of it forgotten. It's as if, for ten minutes, we're watching an entirely different movie, some kind of teen comedy. But what the hell, who cares? Let's see. There's a pitiful little puppy that must be rescued now and again. Then there is McQueen's Girl's little brother who runs out into the streets in his PJs, shoots at the monster with his cap pistol and must be snatched out of harm's way.McQueen had yet to develop his acting chops. He was 27 when this was shot, though he could have passed for a high school kid or at least a young man in a community college. When scared, his jaw drops, he gulps and stutters. His co-stars and supporting players have already reached the zenith of their talents, still leaving them low on the horizon.It's a terrible movie -- derivative and amateurish -- and I get a kick out of it when it's on the telly, as long as it's not on too often. Otherwise it's liable to eat your brain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would imagine that if Steve McQueen knew he would go on to become an icon and start "Wanted: Dead of Alive" the same year this film came out, or be in The Magnificent Seven two years later, he would not have done it. But he did, and we are the richer for it.Sure it's a camp classic. Horror the way it was meant to be for the drive-in theater. It's fun and nostalgic.It is interesting that the last lines of the film were:Lieutenant Dave: At least we've got it stopped. Steve Andrews: Yeah, as long as the Arctic stays cold. They never would have imagined 52 years ago that the Arctic would be thawing. The Blob will soon return.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Vintage Sci-Fi/Horror with A Star in the Making!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Blob" qualifies as a cult sci-fi film not only because it launched 27-year old Steve McQueen on a trajectory to superstardom, but also because it exploited the popular themes both of alien invasion and teenage delinquency that were inseparable in the 1950s. Interestingly, nobody in the Kay Linaker &amp; Theodore Simonson screenplay ever refers to the amorphous, scarlet-red protoplasm that plummeted to Earth in a meteor and menaced everybody in the small town of Downingtown Pennsylvania on a Friday night as "The Blob." Steve McQueen won the role of Josh Randall, the old West bounty hunter in "Wanted: Dead or Alive," after producer Dick Powell saw this Paramount Pictures' release. Meanwhile McQueen's attractive girlfriend Aneta Corsaut went on to star opposite Andy Griffith in "The Andy Griffith Show" as Sheriff Taylor's school teacher girlfriend Helen Crump. Of course, neither McQueen nor Corsaut were teenagers, but then rarely did actual teenagers play actual teenagers. Director Irvin S. Yeaworth, Jr., made his directorial debut with "The Blob." Linaker &amp; Simonson's screenplay synthesized four genres: first, the alien invasion; second, teenage delinquency; third, a murder mystery, and fourth; a horror chiller. Moreover, while the gelatinous substance assumes various shapes, it remains largely anonymous. In other words, the eponymous Jell-O neither talks nor communicates by telepathy. Instead, it kills without a qualm and discriminates against nobody. The tone of "The Blob" is fairly serious in spite of its somewhat campy nature.As the filmmakers point out on the Criterion DVD release of "The Blob," the movie opens uncharacteristically for a sci-fi horror thriller with our hero and heroine in a remote rural locale making out and kissing. Jane (Anita Corsaut) and Steve (Steve McQueen) see a large meteor fall to the earth and drive off to find it. Meanwhile, an old man finds the meteor and prods it with a stick. The meteor cracks open and a slimy bunch of goop clings to the stick. When the old timer (Olin Howland of "The Paleface") gets a closer look at it, the goop attaches itself to his hand. The old guy runs screaming from the crater and Steve nearly hits him with his jalopy. Steve and Jane pick the guy up and take him to see Dr. Hallen in town. Hallen is poised to leave town for a medical conference when Steve and Jane bring the old guy to his office. Hallen phones his nurse to return since he may need to perform an amputation. Of course, Hallen has never seen anything like the substance on the man's forearm. Hallen sends Steve and Jane to find out what happened. Our heroes run into another group of teenagers that ridicule Steve's fast driving. Steve fools him into a reverse drive race, but the local police chief Dave (Earl Rowe) lets him off the hook. Steve and the teenagers visit the site of the meteor crater and find the warm remains of the meteor. After they visit the old man's house and rescue a dog, the teenagers split for a spooky late night movie while Steve and Jane return to Dr. Hallen's office. During the interim, the blob has entirely absorbed the old geezer, killed Hallen's nurse and attacked the doctor. Neither acid thrown on the protoplasm nor Hallen's shotgun have any effect on the blob. Steve catches a glimpse of the blob absorbing Hallen. When Steve and Jane go to the police department to report the incident, Dave is frankly incredulous, while Sergeant Bert (John Benson) believes that it is a prank. Bert has an axe to grind with teenagers because his wife died when one struck her car.Steve and Jane take them to Hallen's office, but they can find neither hide nor hair of anybody, but Dave admits that the office has been vandalized. Against Sgt. Bert's advice, Dave turns the teens over to their respective parents. No sooner have Steve and Jane fooled their folks into believing that they are snugly asleep in bed than they venture out again. They drive into town and spot the old man's dog that got away from them in front of a supermarket. When they go to retrieve the mutt, Steve steps in front of the electric eye door of the grocery store and it opens. They find nobody inside, but they encounter the blob. Steve and Jane take refuge in a freezer and the blob doesn't attack them. Later, after they escape, Steve persuades the teenagers that challenged him in a street race to alert the authorities because he is supposed to be home in bed. Police Chief Dave and the fire department arrive at the supermarket. Steve tries to convince Dave that the blob is in the store. About that time, the blob kills the theater projectionist and attacks the moviegoers. Suddenly, a horde of people exit the theater and Dave believes Steve. Steve and Jane wind up at a lunch counter that the blob attacks. The proprietor and our heroes hole up in the cellar and Steve discovers that a fire extinguisher with its freezing contents forces the blob to back off.The authorities collect every fire extinguisher in town and manage to freeze the blob. The Pentagon sends down a team to transport the blob to the North Pole. As the remains of the blob drift down to the polar ice pack, the end credit appears with a ghostly giant question mark. Producer James B. Harris obtained stock military footage of a Globe master military transport plane depositing the parachute and its cargo."The Blob" proved to be a drive-in hit and Steve McQueen's surge to stardom gave the film added momentum. Unless you are a juvenile, this little horror movie isn't scary at all, but Yeaworth and his scenarists create a sufficient amount of paranoia and sympathy for our heroes. They never show the blob actually assimilating its victims and leave this to your imagination, so "The Blob" isn't without a modicum of subtlety.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an awesome classic monster flick from the 50's! I just love the look of the 50's in general like the cars and the music. Anyway, I love the way the blob looks. I love when the everyone is at the late night horror flick at the theater and the blob comes in and crashes the party. Another thing I love about it is that it takes place all in one night, just like Halloween II.When Steve and Jane are making out, they see a meteor fall from space. Inside the meteor is the blob. Whenever the blob consumes a person, it grows bigger and bigger. They try to convince the people of the town about the blobby monster, but no one believes them until later.

The trouble is that there is the category of "nostalgia", still anchored to the past that can not see the newer versions and then criticize harshly. Then there are just horrible comments under my own, if reject this movie should automatically reject the other 3 is a mechanism. What is the standard series. You can not compare to John Rambo and Rocky Balboa as are two different kinds. Indiana Jones is very comics while Stallone adheres more to reality, trying to be as close to reality. The latest Rambo is a beautiful film, but America ultrapropaganda to be much more realistic than those of the 80s. Violent scenes and events that unfortunately show the terrible ethnic cleansing in Myanmar married with a desire for revenge of the viewer and the same Rambo.</fullReview>

This one is the version with Steve McQueen, not the other one.Now then, on to actually reviewing this movie. This movie is Science Fiction at its purest. There are no cheesy special effects here, no computer generated graphics. Steve McQueen does a great job in his portrayal of Steve Andrews. I thought the special effects with the blob itself were particularly impressive considering the technology available back in 1958. This movie is a must-see for Sci-Fi buffs and anyone else who enjoys a good old fashioned horror flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like KING KONG VS GODZILLA (read my comment), I always wanted to see this film. People advised me to see the 1988 remake. I saw it, and it was terrible. When I saw the original on Fear Net On Demand, it was nothing but pure fun entertainment. The opening title song is very catchy, "Beware of the Blob that creeps and leaps all over the floor..." The special effects were simple. The shapeless beast is nothing but a bag of methane cellulose, which is the ingredient that makes milkshakes and jello. According to the commentary of the EQUINOX DVD, it was the brainchild of Jack H. Harris. His studio wasn't getting enough money and they were distributing independent westerns and Jack said, I'll come up with a monster that no one has ever thought of. The result was this movie. It got spoofed many times such as THE SIMPSONS episode, "Married to the Blob". I loved this movie. It rocks! Screw the 1988 remake. It is full of unnecessary gore. Here is another fact, this movie was shot entirely in Philadelphia! True. The Colonial Theater where all the people ran out is a Philidelphian theater! MYSTERIOUS PLANET was shot in New Hampshire (read my comment). Here's another fact, after the film was made, a sequel was to made called SON OF THE BLOB (a.k.a. BEWARE THE BLOB), but it wasn't made until 14 years later. At the end of the film, you see the "The End" text appear and the letters merge together and form a question mark. That technique got applied in other films like DINOSAURUS (1960), EQUINOX (1970), Dino Dellaurentiis FLASH GORDON (1980) and that TOM AND JERRY cartoon where the duo are in the future and they blow themselves up and the are in the prehistoric times and they chase each other. Back on the subject on THE BLOB, I highly recommend to watch this movie and compare and contrast it to the 1988 remake because the original is pure Americana.Not rated, but a good PG will do for all the violence and scary moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...Maybe. This small town seems to have a lot of respect for each other, despite illusions. Maybe it's the small-town warmth, but even when breaking major safety laws, Steve McQueen's charm has its toll over even the chief of police.Said charm is the bread and butter of this classic schlock horror picture from the 50s. He and his lovely young beau costar do their innocent fight against an indescribable alien form in the best way possible: being absolutely cute to the adults, and being absolutely cool to the younguns. In a land of midnight horror triple features and warm family diners, its hard not to watch this movie and not end up with a huge heapin' of the old nostalgia.As for the horror itself... I've never really cared for this movie for that. The blob is at its best, though, when it's seeping through some small space. Some of the best effects and tension are created during those moments.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Molten Meteor from Space is really...a Blob!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This monster picture can lay claims to producing one of the ultimate monsters of filmdom. It began screen story life as something like 'The Molten Meteorite' and then the filmmakers were tossing a bunch of names around, like 'Glob.' We all know what they finally settled on and it turned out to be fortunate - as if always destined to be "The Blob." Like "The Thing," it's a very effective and straightforward title for a creature feature. It's now a fairly archetypal monster movie of the fifties and possibly the most famous from that era. It's got all the right elements of the time: menace from outer space, small town paranoia and generational conflicts, and a memorable creature which can't be stopped. Its strengths include sharp color (rare for a monster pic of that time) and nice, clean photography (especially evident with the latest DVD version from Criterion). It also has Steve McQueen in his first starring role; he supposedly plays a teen, tho he was in his late twenties at the time.The drawbacks have to do with a low budget: despite the good cinematography, most scenes are restricted to static medium shots of the 3 or 4 characters in the scene, with no cutaways. In other words, the camera stays on these 3 or 4 people as they talk and the scene plays out for several minutes. This results in a slow, draggy tone for most of the movie, though there are moments of tension during sequences in the dark, where the Blob may roll into view any second. Whenever the Blob shows up, of course, the energy returns, as it begins right from its 1st appearance as a small globule, latching on to its first victim, the old man in the woods. Most of the actors are in their first roles or amateurs, though it's not that glaring a problem. They actually manage to capture the ambiance of fifties small-town Americana quite well. The threat of the Blob creature can be quite terrifying, especially for kids. It absorbs victims in an obviously painful manner, made clear by its first victim, and tho certain restrictions of the era did not allow the filmmakers to graphically depict this painful process later in the film, our imaginations did the job for them.It's kind of a shame no better sequel surfaced than the lame "Beware!the Blob" from actor Larry Hagman many years later; the ending here, complete with a literal question mark, was a great set-up for another monster mash - it should've happened in the early sixties. The remake in the late eighties upgraded the way the creature moved around due to a bigger budget and new special FX, but I still prefer the very basic circular creeping Blob of this original. Also, writer Dean Koontz upgraded the concept for his monster novel "Phantoms," also made as a film in the late nineties.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Blob (1958) is a great 50's sci-fi film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up with this awesome movie and fell in love with it the first time I saw it. I just can't get enough of that homicidal pile of goo. Me and all my friends used to watch this over and over when I had it on VHS. And now that I have it on DVD, we can do that again and bring back a lot of good memories.The film starts with a catchy title song called "Beware of the Blob" by Burt Bacharach then cuts to Steve Andrews (played excellently by Steve McQueen) and his girlfriend Jane (Aneta Courseit) making out in his car on top of a mountain. Suddenly, a small meteor crashes near them and is discovered by an old man who finds a tiny gelatin substance inside of it which engulfs his whole hand (!) and starts to grow bigger. Steve takes him to the hospital, where the mass of goo devours the old man's whole body then eats a doctor and a nurse. The blob escapes and oozes around the town eating everything and everyone in site growing bigger and bigger with each person it consumes! It even attacks a movie theater and a diner before being frozen alive by a bunch of CO2 fire extinguishers in the film's thrilling climax.This movie truly is a classic and has some great special effects for a 50's film. The blob looks truly great and realistic. It does move kind of slow though and if I saw it, it would be very easy to get away from but I was still a happy camper upon viewing this sci-fi masterpiece. There was a few other things I didn't care for like some of the acting which was very bad (that irritating little kid, errr...) and the blob probably could have done more damage, but this is still the best Blob film by far and was followed by a 1972 sequel and a 1988 remake which are both very good.</fullReview>

The special effects were great, even by today's standards. The Blob has just enough scare to know you're supposed to be scared yet without all the blood and gore that horror movies today have. Think Tremors.Fantastic movie! I'm adding the sequel(s) to my Netflix queue right now! Maybe I'll even see the remake.. This was so much fun..This is also my first Steve McQueen movie, and I can't wait to see more! Walt D in LV.. 11-6-05.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You've probably heard the theme song. But whether or not you have, you still gotta see "The Blob". It's truly a classic sci-fi movie. The acting isn't exactly top-notch, but this is a movie that you're bound to like.The plot goes like this: one night, teenagers Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen) and Jane Martin (Aneta Corsaut) are making out, when a strange mass from outer space attacks a farmer, and slowly but surely starts taking over the town, getting bigger with each victim. Sound simplistic? Well we shouldn't expect '50s sci-fi movies to be anything else! The movie is just plain cool. There are some things that we sort of know are going to be in a '50s movie about teenagers - namely that the stubborn adults won't believe them, and the kind of dress that Jane wears. Steve McQueen is cool as always, and it's sort of surprising to see Aneta Corsaut (aka Helen on "The Andy Griffith Show") in this movie. Actually, a number of people who later became famous on TV shows started out in sci-fi/horror flicks from the '50s and early '60s. Frances Bavier (Aunt Bee on "The Andy Griffith Show") starred in "The Day the Earth Stood Still"; Alan Hale (the Skipper on "Gilligan's Island") starred in "The Crawling Hand"; Russell Johnson (the Professor on "Gilligan's Island") starred in "It Came from Outer Space" and "This Island Earth"; and Robert Reed (the "Brady Bunch" dad) starred in "Bloodlust". It's surprising that Dick Van Dyke never had to battle 20-eyed gorgothoids from Planet X.But let's not get off the subject. If "The Blob" is a B-movie, it's one of the neatest B-movies out there. And the 1988 remake was actually quite good also.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Blob (1958) was one of the bigger name films from the fifties. The movie has become a part of Americana and it spawned a sequel and a big budget remake that was made during that bastion of film making era "the eighties". Steve McQueen become a movie legend. Despite the cheesy special effects and suspect acting, the movie has become a big name in the horror/science fiction lore.A meteorite crashes outside a podunk town. A homeless drunk finds the space rock and touches it with a stick. Something that resembles a twenty-five cent plastic container of neon gloop becomes stuck to the wino's hand. He freaks out big time and seeks refuge at a doctor's house. The kind doctor takes him in and tries to get a hold of the hospital. By the time he comes back, the derelict has morphed into a giant size pile of goo. That's when the fun really begins. Steve McQueen stars as a local rapscallion who becomes a reluctant hero. How does he save the day and becomes a respectable citizen? Find out when you watch THE BLOB!! Followed by the a bizarre sequel.Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pay Very Close Attention (possible spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently attended a screening of "The War Of the Worlds" at my University and was astounded and disappointed at how the students proceeded to mock the film for it's weak acting and unrealistic visuals, completely discarding any deeper value because of an unfamiliar surface. I would expect a similar reaction to "The Blob," and the students would be missing out on just as much substance.Other than an awful title and some obvious (although trivial and inconsequential) plot holes, the film suffers from two key drawbacks. The low budget hurt the film in that they had to settle for some highly inexperienced actors to play important roles, Earl Rowe as Lt. Dave is the most easily recognizable. The film also fell into the normal 50's Hollywood plot/narrative structure which, due to the concept material, relied on sloppy acting and poor writing to educate the audience.However, the consistent and applicable self-reference, along with fabulous chemistry between the two lead characters makes this film worth watching. There's the obvious self-reference in the movie theater, but we are also given a fantastic child performance who captures the plight of the town in his simple comments. My personal favourite scene of the film occurs with Danny's parents finding him downstairs and when they find out that he is guarding them, they as him what it is he's guarding them from. He responds, quietly and innocently "I don't know." Brilliant!My second favourite scene is the interchange between Steve and Jane about whether Steve even believes himself. At least these two actors knew how to be both impactful and believable; a rare occurrence in 50's sci-fi indeed!A science-fiction film which lacks both good acting and good special effects doesn't seem to have much going for it, and the current IMDb rating for this film would be a testament to that. However, the material which this film deals with is portrayed smoothly and competently. The film could have benefited from some alternate narrative techniques and a bigger budget, but the end result is still a satisfying and respectable effort. Just don't pause the screen during the multitude's flight from the movie theater to see the numerous extras laughing while they're supposed to be fleeing for their lives.3 out of 5 - Some strong elements</fullReview>

When the blob rolled under a car and absorbed the mechanic working on it, I'd had enough! I got up from my seat and left the theater by a side door, letting sunlight shine through into the patron's eyes - I didn't even take the time to close the door behind me! I went home and when my brother and friends saw me later they laughed and called me a baby. I was worried about getting a nightmare. Well flash-forward about 20 years or so. I saw that it was going to be on TV on a saturday afternoon on the local show known as 'Dr. Shock' (with a man named Joe Zawislak as the doctor). He specialized in showing b (and even c) grade horror movies on channel 17, a UHF station here in Philadelphia desperate for programming. So I finally saw what I'd missed as a kid.

		<shortDescription>A fun little chiller; a great example of that classic "drive-in horror" style of filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE BLOB is a timeless horror classic, enjoyable by viewers of all ages and interests. The plot involves an indestructible, man-eating ball of goo that increases in size with each kill. The origin of this blob and the motivation for its killing are never really made clear; all the viewer knows is that it hatched from a meteorite after smashing into the Earth's surface.The story is actually rather unsettling, somehow managing to make your skin crawl while still maintaining an effective, tongue-in-cheek sense of humor. Besides following the blob's trail of victims, we are also privy to the disbelieving community's reactions. They simply dismiss the endless warnings of a "man-eating blob monster on the loose" as a prank being played by neighborhood teens. The special effects used to depict the blob and its various attacks are silly and primitive, but they do succeed in getting their point across quite efficiently. Viewers will never forget the scene where an unsuspecting cinema audience is terrorized by the gigantic creature.THE BLOB's cast is likeable and decently acted, and the script offers (for the most part) surprisingly detailed character development, helping to provide reason for the characters' somewhat eccentric actions. Steve McQueen's portrayal of Steve Andrews may be a little wooden at times, but he's a convincing protagonist nonetheless.If you haven't seen THE BLOB yet, do yourself a favor and get ahold of a copy. Refrain from watching it until you are alone during a dark, stormy night, and you'll experience just how thrilling old, B-grade horror flicks can be.</fullReview>

But that it was a great story, put to film, that is as engrossing today as when it made it's first appearance. This film along with others:(Caltiki- The Immortal Monster, The H-Man, X-The Unknown) are all from a time period when scares &amp; scaring people was a great thing to do. Even if you've seen this film and the others listed, they all give back their value as pure escapist fun, each &amp; every time you watch them.

		<fullReview>I've always liked this movie because when I was ten I saw it as a double feature with "I Married a Monster from Outer Space." I remember the bouncy theme song and the eerie quality of the beginning. A meteor lands and an old man finds it. Poking it with a stick, a taffy like substance makes its way down and suddenly swallows up his arm. He, of course, is absorbed and the fun begins.This fun flick, is one of those many fifties' teenagers are misunderstood movies. We have the nice cop and the angry cop, who has it in for the local teenagers because of something that happened to his family. McQueen has a bad rep and his credibility is constantly in doubt because of his hot rodding. Aneta Corsaut, Helen Crump from "The Andy Griffith Show" is his female companion. She is misunderstood as well. McQueen is suspect and her father, a prototype fifties take no hostages father, forbids their seeing each other. Some things haven't changed and it fuels the fire. Meanwhile, the blob is soaking up the locals at an alarming rate. There is my favorite where a mechanic, lying on one of those creepers, is pulled under the car, his legs twitching. Then there's the strawberry jam, oozing out through the openings in the projection booth. But like all good teen movies, the kids know more than the adults and save the day. They even get to break the windows at the high school. The movie is pure fun and not to be taken so seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't have to tell you that this one of the best alien/monster movies of the 50s and still remains a classic! This was Steve McQueen's first movie, earning him $3,000. Much of the film was made in Phoenixville, Downingtown and other parts of Chester County. The film cost $240,000 to make and grossed $4 million. Yeah BABY!The diner is being taken over and not by the BLOB this time, but by John DeLuca. DeLuca claims he will be the one to finally kill the Blob and the diner's B-movie image. He recently purchased the Cadillac, as it was last known, plans to turn it into "Yuppyville", with a country atmosphere to boot and call it Chefs. I don't think a CO2 cartridge will work here folks!The scraps of movie memorabilla have been placed in storage. The pink booths and teal walls gone, in favor of soft earthy tones. The food will be replaced, no more blob burgers! : ( Just help yourself to good ol healthy american cuisine.The diner is set to open this fall with the staging of a mock Blob funeral. DeLuca claims that the Blob will always live on at the diner. It's just that now the Blob will have a pair of docksiders. ALL BLOB FANS ARE CRINGING! How can you yuppify a lethal lump of blood-red jello?BIG MISTAKE! The only thing that John DeLuca is killing is a "piece of cinematic history"! Downingtown is well known for this diner and it should be perserved as a Landmark.I guess Wes Shank should just eat the gelatinous silicone substance that he bought from the movie director in 1965, cause it's all over for the Blob. That slop in the 5-gallon bucket doesn't amount to much now.......or does it?In memory of the Blob, please do send flowers to the diner and please do see the movie again for the 50th, 100th, or for you new kiddies on the block, see it for the first time.Flags at half staff, come this fall!Long live the Blob!</fullReview>

The cops headed by the very kind and understanding Let. Dave, Earl Rowe, and his assistant the hot headed and hawkish, when it comes to teenagers, Sgt. Jim Bert, John Benson, at first think that Steve and Jane are either drunk of high on pot and are seeing things like pink elephants or walking giant strawberry Jello mixtures. It's not until the "Blob" break into the projection booth, thus eating the projectionist, of the towns movie house that the cops and citizens of Phonixville finally wake up in knowing their they as well as their loved ones lives are in immediate danger. But by now the "Blob" has gotten a head start, in eating dozens of people, by growing to the size of a tractor trailer!***Spoilers*** Life and death struggle between the people of Phoenixville and the attacking "Blob" that culminates in George's Vincent Barbi, "Dowingtown Diner" just outside of town. Steve trapped in the diner together with Jane finally figures out what to use against the "Blob" when everything else, bullets electricity flame throwers and even nuclear weapons, becomes useless! Good old Co 2 sub-freezing cold air! Being the super Cool cat that he eventually became Steve McQueen used his coolness, together with dozens of fire extinguishers, to put an end to he "Blob" in freezing it stiff and sending it on a one way trip to the frozen Artic circle where it can't harm anyone. That's, as Steve says a the end of the movie, as long as the Artic stays cold!P,S Steve McQueen's first major role that put him on the road to become the highest paid actor of his generation that lasted until his untimely death of lung cancer, at age 50, twenty two years later in November 1980. Despite the success of the film McQueen did't, like its critics, think much of the mega million dollar hit by accepting a flat $2,500.00 for his role in it. In McQueen by turning down a 10% cut of the movie's overall profits which were well over $4,000,000.00 McQueen, a struggling and almost unknown actor at the time, threw away as much as 20 times the cash-$4000,000.00-then what he ended up getting by the films producers. This must have haunted McQueen, who was extremely tight with his money, for the rest of his life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Blob" could have been a little better in places. That's not to say the film is bad-not at all. One thing that brought my rating down is the acting from the teenagers aside from Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsaut. There was a noticeable drop-off, especially when they are in a scene together. Another was that there was too much time spent on trying to get the town to believe them about the Blob. I would have liked to have seen a little less time with that aspect and more time given to deciding how to destroy it. A bit of editing could have helped. OK, now for the positives. Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsaut have good chemistry and are very likable. Ol' Steve is cool-as-a-cucumber. The rest of the acting is good and the idea for the monster is pretty original. I liked the scene where it is attached on to the old man's arm and engulfs him slowly. Another great scene is where it attacks the Doctor and nurse. All in all, a decent Sci-Fi film that could have been a bit better than my rating suggests.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Blob starts off with a theme tune for the titular space blob that goes like this: "Beware of the blob, it creeps, And leaps and glides and slides, Across the floor, Right through the door, And all around the wall, A splotch, a blotch, Be careful of the blob". I was immediately won over.This much-loved 50s sci-fi classic stars a young-ish Steve McQueen (he was 28 at the time) as the unlikely, and reluctant, hero when a strange blob begins to absorb the creatures and people it comes into contact with and grows bigger and bigger and bigger. It takes a while to convince the older, sensible folk that something is majorly amiss so it's up to the youngsters to try and come up with a solution.I enjoyed The Blob but I didn't love it as much as many other horror fans do. There certainly is a lot to win you over though (that title song being the first) but the whole film is dragged down by some poor pacing in the first half of the movie and some bad acting and characterisations. The youngsters aren't at all memorable, with the exception of McQueen and his main co-star Aneta Corsaut, and the older characters are really just there to realise that maybe they should listen to the kids every once in a while.That's where the fun comes from. It's not all that special, although the titular creature is a fantastic and fun creation of blob-tastic blobbiness (not to be confused, ever, with the dire Mr Blobby), but it has a pleasing core of minor anarchy that sees a bit of vandalism and youthful energy being put to good use to offer a possible solution in a very strange situation.The effects also hold up remarkably well considering the film is now over 50 years old so that's another plus point. I wouldn't rush to watch it again but I wouldn't gouge my eyes out to avoid it either, by any means. It's a fun, light horror that I don't see as a classic of the genre but it will always hold a special place in the hearts of many.For now, though, let's end with that opening number again: "Beware of the blob, it creeps, And leaps and glides and slides, Across the floor, Right through the door, And all around the wall, A splotch, a blotch, Be careful of the blob".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A meteor crashes to Earth in a small American town and its inner mass of a sticky, protozoa-like substance begins a slow but steady killing spree. Nothing really substantial here, but not a disgrace: "The Blob" is a fun, fast-paced B-flick made for teenagers circa 1958. It features beautifully saturated colors and at least one stand-out amongst the cast. Attempting to rally the disbelieving town police and the city residents to his side, Steve McQueen is very effective in his youthful seriousness; he later made jokes about the movie, but it's a solid performance. The picture has been directed with a sure, even hand, the script has some intentionally funny passages, and the cinematographer manages to get some great shots (and one iconic image of a large crowd of people--possibly too many people for this late in the evening--fleeing a movie theater). Followed by a sequel in 1972, and later remade with heavy doses of hysteria and gore, this "Blob" is a little light on nightmarish scares, but its white-bread innocence is both naive and simple--and perhaps reassuring. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK. Let's get over the notion that Steve McQueen was a grown man when he played a teenager in this film. The rest of the film was very enjoyable. The Movie Theatre scene was by far the most impressive of its' type. The screaming kids running in a panic from the monster blob.....well, that couldn't happen today. The police were nearly "Mayberry Mellow" and the rest of the characters just seemed to be overly tranquil. I thought I was going to see Ward Cleaver appear next at one moment. The casting just seemed a bit low budget. The Blob was the star of the show, and only got about one minute and a half of screen time. One idea still rings loud and clear about modern times. No one believes there is a problem to solve until they see it for themselves. I guess that today, we would need to see the Blob on CNN before anyone believes we have a Blob to kill. The Remake of the BLOB had a chance, but blew it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Freaky 50s Fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 50s, the US economy was booming (hence the term "baby boomers"). So much so that many kids could afford their own cars, go off to college, hang out with their friends at the drive-in theaters, and just be carefree. The movie biz knew their audience. Teens wanted action, intrigue, romance, and adventure with just a hint of danger. In answer to their demands, the 50s saw the rise of the monster movies. In the films, a group of teens would usually team up and battle a gigantic monster of some sort. While most were pretty laughable (but fun), some stood out as iconic. THE BLOB is, without a doubt, one of the best to emerge from the horror/sci-fi genre. In a typical small American town, Steve (played by Steve McQueen) and Jane are on a date. When they spot something streak across the sky and crash land. Upon investigating, they discover an old man with a blob attached to his hand. Being clean-cut, well-meaning kids, they drive him to the local doctor. But things take a turn for the freaky. And soon, terror seizes the town as the blob grows bigger and bigger. Absorbing everyone in its path. But how can they possibly stop it? Acting is top-notch, with a young Steve McQueen giving his role a down-home sincerity and boyish charm. Overall, the film is entertaining. Though it's obvious that the blob is nothing more than a pile of gelatin, it adds just the right amount of camp to everything. And that's the reason why teens often packed the theaters when these movies came out. To best enjoy it turn down the lights, make some popcorn, and get taken back to a simpler time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who asks why Steve McQueen was so good, here's a great answer. Even in his first feature, an ultra low budget affair with a red gelatinous mass in the title role, Stevie Mac gives an unforgettable performance in an otherwise forgettable movie. And while he already seems too old to portray a semi-delinquent juvenile, McQueen miraculously pulls it off.There are other good performances. Aneta Corsaut, best known as Andy Griffith's squeeze Helen Crump, is excellent as Steve's put-upon, slightly frantic girlfriend. Robert Fields also stands out as Steve's drag-race rival Tony. And the plot is really not bad, particularly by '50s monster movie standards. This movie was the first for him too, while some older character actors fill out the cast admirably. And again, the film was shot on a minuscule budget, so if you're expecting great editing or special effects, don't.Just expect to see a great actor at the beginning of a very successful, albeit dilated, career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure, it's a 50's drive-in special, but don't let that fool you. In my little book, there are a number of intelligent touches with unexpected dollops of humor. Catch the redoubtable Mrs. Porter who's supposed to keep an eye on the doc's place. She not only steals the scene, but darn near the whole movie. And where did those indie producers come up with the bucks to film in color, a wise decision, since the blob would not show up well in b&amp;w. Yes, the result is ragged around the edges as the number of goofs illustrate. But except for several of the teens, the non-Hollywood cast performs well. Then too, the byplay among hot-rodders and cops comes across as lively and entertaining. Pretty darn good for a couple of directors more at home in a pulpit than on a sound stage. Apparently, they wanted to portray teens in a positive light at a time when the screen was filled with "juvenile delinquents". Then again, the 27-year old McQueen hardly qualifies in the age department, but manages the hot-rodder attitude anyway. The movie was a hit at the time, helped along, no doubt, by the catchy title tune that got a lot of radio play. And except for the unfortunate final effects, the movie is still a lot of fun, drive-in or no drive-in. Meanwhile, I'm awaiting the blob's return now that the polar icecap is turning into, shall we say, refrigerator water.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Night in Fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sure is an interesting little horror movie in the line of the many that were released in the 50's in the genre.A sort of a creeping eating-man blob that grows constantly falls from outer-space and menaces the lives of the people of a small community somewhere in the USA. A couple of teenagers (a young Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsaut) konow about the menace but adults don't take them seriously. The whole story takes place through a single night.McQueen's presence raises this product; though he wasn't a star back then, you could tell he was on his way (he got his real kick right after this one as Vin in the successful "The Nagnificent Seven").Not very prolific director Irvin S. Yeaworth does it acceptable here with a most simple and prolix handling. Though the special effects that give life to the monster would seem perhaps funny for today's computer standards I remember they worked well for kids like me when I saw "The Blob" when it was released in theatres. A color and an unusual and sticky -for this kind of films- main song also helps the product and its originalityAll in all, this is an unpretentious horror/sci-fi movie worth a watch at least and an example of what the genre had to offer back then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Blob was a 1950's drive-in movie aimed at the teenage audience. Some people consider it a sci-fi classic but it is pretty corny. It does have Steve McQueen in his first lead role. If you are a McQueen fan (me!) you owe it to yourself to see him in this. He's pretty wooden but you can see his charisma. The plot is simple. A meteor lands which contains the Blob, an amorphous mass. The Blob rolls around the town and gobbles up people. The teenagers in the movie try to convince the authorities (the local police) but no one will listen to them (typical 1950s message movie.) There is a remade version but it's not near as good, which isn't saying much. The Blob is something to watch late Saturday night with popcorn and wise-cracking buddies.</fullReview>

Since then I have watched it probably 2000 times at least. I know it backwards and forwards. Well about the movie, it may not have had the best acting in it, but it was not them that I was watching, I was interested in what the monster was doing. This was a good movie for me because it made my imagination work over time to figure out how this thing moved. I also was very interested in how the people acted back then.

		<fullReview>I was there for the filming of the scenes at the Downingtown Diner. I often wondered why they did not film at the Vale Rio Diner in Phonexville as the "Blob" came out of the Colonial theater there, down the street and to the diner. As I often have breakfast at the Vale Rio I asked one of the long time waitresses as to why not. She explained the Vale Rio diner has no basement. As we know they retreated from the "blob" into the basement and were rescued from a basement window. Another note is: the steps leading up into the Police station (Downingtown) no longer exist as they have a new station and the Building has been made over. That side of the building no longer has exit or entry to/from the Lincoln Hwy. The Downingtown High school still exists and looks the same where they broke into the school to get C02 cylinders. I have a photo of the car used by Steve Mcqueen in the movie, as I was asked to make a "dupe" in my darkroom many years ago for the brother of the local fellow who let them use his car in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remembered "The Blob" as a creepy, scary movie when I was a kid. Seeing it again recently I marveled that it had become a cult classic. Except for the last few frames, it has not stood the test of time.I know this was Steve McQueen's break-out movie, after which he was a hot commodity in Hollywood. Yet he seemed so miscast here -- a 28-year-old man playing a teenager was not believable at all.In addition, the Blob was puny, slow-moving, and not at all threatening. The fact that it managed to kill not only the doctor but his nurse as well was laughable. And the old geezer who is the Blob's first victim -- why did he touch the goopy glop, anyway? I'd like to mention those last few frames. The scene of the Blob being deposited at the North Pole managed to be compelling. (Yet the Blob seemed tiny and impotent even there!) It was indeed prescient of the makers of this film to find an early tie-in to global warming. I loved how this movie ended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly good movie within its genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though this is one incredibly simplistic and cheap made '50's monster movie, it's still one that works out surprising well.It really has all of the ingredients in it to be a bad movie. Some lousy dialog, some incredibly stupid and unlikely situation and one of the most unlikely monster villains out of movie history. Yet when it all gets brought together it works out surprising well and above all things as very entertaining. Even the bad dialog and acting and the awkward unnecessary long sequences that add nothing at all to movie its story, all help to give the movie a great kind of atmosphere and style all over it. It's hard to take a movie like this very seriously and it's clumsy film-making only adds to this, which in return makes this strangely enough a very entertaining one to watch.Perhaps it's actually being due to the fact that this movie has such an unlikely but original monster in it that it works out far better and more entertaining than just the average genre attempt, from around the same time period. It's a faceless monster, without any motivation and without any back-story. It came from outer space and it consumes everything in its path as it grows and grows and that's all we need to know about it really. It makes it also quite unpredictable, which makes the movie original to watch as well.Another reason why this movie has become sort of a cult-classic over the years is because it features Steve McQueen in his first leading role. It's definitely kind of surreal seeing the great Steve McQueen acting in a type of movie like this one. He did the best he could with the awkward dialog but he still couldn't prevent that the acting in this movie came across as lazy and silly. It's nothing more than a fun fact that this movie features Steve McQueen but just don't expect him to shine in this, though his charisma and sort of bad boy look and behavior is already very notable.For a B-monster movie from the '50's, with science-fiction elements in it, the movie definitely has some surprising good effects in it as well. It doesn't feature 'the blob' as prominently as you might aspect but the effects used for it are simply convincing. It actually used different effects for it throughout the movie but all of them blend in well with the entire movie and make it actually a very threatening and convincing movie monster.About as good and as entertaining as the genre can get.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Blob</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Within a small meteorite houses an alien gelatinous substance which consumes and absorbs humans, growing in size as it feeds on the citizens of a small town. It'll be up to teen couple Steve(Steve McQueen)&amp; Jane(Aneta Corsaut)to get others, including the disbelieving police, to believe them or else the monstrous blob could threaten the entire country. One weapon our heroes might have to stop it's surge is cold, such as when the blob attempts to seize Steve and Jane in a meat locker only to leave the premises altogether.It's value as a classic questioned by many, there's no doubt that I've seen many homages and influences to and from "The Blob". How many movies I've seen regarding a circular meteorite, cracking open releasing an alien menace of some sort. Is it schlock, no doubt, a blob monster eating humans and growing larger as the 50's teens speak their hip lingo, race cars, see "spook shows" and stay up all night with McQueen method acting as if he were in a Rebel Without a Cause attempting to portray a really confused and frightened teen trying to convince the olders that what he saw(..a doctor getting absorbed by the blob)is not some false joke. McQueen was already cementing himself as a cultural icon right from the beginning, here in this film, as the young hero working the late shift trying to find traces of the blob monster he's sure he saw, with Aneta Corsaut(..the school teaching love interest for the sheriff on The Andy Griffith Show)by his side as they race against time to halt the terror before it consumes an entire community. Like many films afterward, the theme of a generational gap between adults and teenagers regarding a type of cultural divide is displayed in "The Blob" as Steve spends an endless amount of time trying to get others to believe him. This is especially the case regarding the sheriff's deputy who firmly believes throughout that Steve is merely pulling their leg. The blob is a hoot, like an ever-flowing pudding which squeezes through cracks and crevices seeking man-food. Such as the blob's entrance into a matinée. There is a degree of the "ick-factor" in this film(..which will be further exploited to a superior degree in the remake)regarding the creature's slow-devouring of the first victim(..we see how it starts with his fingers, covering his arm before we see the blob in complete form for the first time) who cracked open the meteorite which got the community into the entire catastrophic mess. I think the remake, made in 88, is better on practically every level, although Kevin Dillon is a rather poor substitute for McQueen(..not that anyone else could slide in that role and not pale in comparison). Just enjoy the campy nature of it all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this movie was shown in the 50's, it was a much better fit, than by todays standards. Universal theme of adults don't understand teenagers is overused and not done well. Generation gap of the 50's that accelerates in the 60's, makes tension look trite.But that being said, of the 2 actors that showed any acting ability, Steve McQueen and Anita Corsaut, the movie at least makes sense. The special effects are decent,the Blob at the theatre is a watered down version of the shower scene in "Psycho", it made you think twice when you go to the show. Unfortunately, the Diner scene looks like raspberry jelly smeared on a postcard. Too many early scenes rely on strange dialogue to carry the film, but they do not work. The Blob was an interesting project that could have been a lot better. This is one of the few films where I recommend the 1988 remake with Kevin Dillon and Shawnee Smith. So see then both and make up your own mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE BLOB (Irwin S. Yeaworth Jr. and, uncredited, Russell A. Doughten Jr., 1958) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had first watched this several years ago on a now-defunct Sicilian TV channel; amazingly, the film emerged as a heftily-priced DVD from Criterion: not being sure what I had made of it initially (despite having attained cult status over the years, the achievement proper is clearly viewed with modesty even by genre buffs), I opted not to make the purchase ? as I did with the similar and, to me, unfamiliar FIEND WITHOUT A FACE (1958). Recently, however, I managed to acquire THE BLOB via a copy of the Spanish DVD which, interestingly, ported over the two Audio Commentary tracks from the Criterion "Special Edition"?but, regrettably, I could not switch off the Spanish subtitles during playback of the main feature! Anyway, looking at the film anew, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it (despite many a narrative flaw, which I will get to later) ? as a pure example of 'B-movie' schlockiness (atypically shot in pleasant color) and a time-capsule illustrating late 1950s social attitudes. The male lead was an early role for Steve(n) McQueen and, though the actor may have subsequently looked at it with disdain, his sole contribution to the genre proves fairly engaging: not averse to juvenile kicks but still essentially a decent (and, more importantly, altruistic) kid. The special effects depicting the slimy and expanding creature are not too bad of its kind and period; the film itself rises to a good climax ? beginning with the monster's invasion of a cinema (showing DAUGHTER OF HORROR [1953/7] as I mentioned recently in that film's review but being curiously screened 'flipped' and which sequence, incidentally, would be featured at the opening of a satirical Italian program actually called "Blob"!). As to the admittedly minor quibbles I have with the film: the monster is not shown traveling ? it just turns up at a variety of places, never being seen by anyone!; there is a baffling over-emphasis (tantamount to padding) on the kids' scrapes with Police; it is silly to have the town doctor shoot at The Blob ? as if fluid, whatever its proportion, can be destroyed by bullets!; equally nonsensical is having the teenagers alert the townsfolk of the danger by making door-to-door visits (especially when considering that, at that stage, only McQueen had actually seen the monster in action)! An inferior sequel emerged in 1972 called BEWARE THE BLOB!; the original was then remade in 1988 ? I watched this not too long ago but it seems not to have made a lasting impression on me (though I know Micheal Elliott loves it). For the record, I will be following this viewing with two more collaborations between director Yeaworth and producer Jack H. Harris, namely 4D MAN (1959) and DINOSAURUS! (1960).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1st watched 2/4/2009, 4 out of 10(Dir-Irvin S. Yeaworth, Jr.): OK, but lacking thriller about a blob of jelly coming from a meteorite and terrorizing a small town in mid-America. Steven McQueen(as he's credited here) is OK in his first movie stint as the naive youngster who finds an old man with the goo stuck to his hand and escorts him to the doctor. Of course, the blob then takes over the man entirely and gobbles up the doctor and Steven's character is the only one who sees this and is left to try and convince local authorities and the townsfolk. A lot of the major section of the movie involves this convincing issue, which kind of slows down the movie. Once he finally convinces an authority figure, the blob shows itself to everyone for the final scene. The blob is kind of scary, but mostly just gooey and the cast takes things just a little too lackadaisical for a horror/thriller movie. Sure, when this first came out it was probably unique but it really just doesn't stand the test of time. The movie would be OK as a time capsule phenomenon but nothing else. So, beware viewing public the blob's not that good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I might as well get it off my chest right from the beginning...I'm not a big fan of this movie. Evidently I'm in the minority, for THE BLOB is still often considered one of the best of all fifties monster flicks. This "cult classic" begins splendidly, as a soaring meteorite crashes to Earth one evening just as over-sized 28-year-old teenager Steve McQueen is making out in his car with The Andy Griffith Show's Aneta Corsaut. They drive off into the night to investigate. In the meantime, old man Olin Howland leaves his wooded shack in the forest and finds a nearby crater where the smoking meteorite has landed. Poking it curiously with a stick, he is horrified when it cracks open to reveal a gooey parasite, which instantly slithers its way onto his hand and won't come off. In a panic, the old man runs off into the road where McQueen and his girlfriend nearly hit him with their car. The two "kids" exit their vehicle and place the nervous victim into the back seat and proceed to rush him to the nearest doctor.Thus end the best moments of THE BLOB. While Dr. Hallen prepares treatment for the unfortunate old patient with the gunk on his arm, our leading couple is out playing car racing games with some other juveniles, even coming close to getting a ticket from Police Lieutenant Dave. This bit of nonsense seriously mars the suspense that was building regarding the elderly man and the Blob, which starts to consume him and grow.And this is basically why the movie degenerates: boring stretches of inactivity in place of what should have been more marauding monster madness. The Blob grows larger and larger as it devours townsfolk, but while these rare sequences are well-staged and the special effects are first-rate for the era, they're weakened by too many padded incidents, like McQueen endlessly trying to convince leery adults who look younger than he does that there is a deadly creature oozing around town. There is far too much discussion, stalling, thinking and then re-thinking of everything without acting on it. Ho-hum. If not for the film's color novelty, I doubt fans would think as much of it as they do. Truth be told, I'd rather watch the 1972 "sequel" BEWARE!

		<fullReview>Whoever thought that something as simple as a blob could gain so much popularity? This the film that launched the career of Steve McQueen. What's unique about the movie is that it's in color, unlike most other 50s creature features. Is it good? Well, let's jump right in.The plot of the film is pretty simple: Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen) and some friends were doing some silly teenager things like racing backwards when they notice that an extraterrestrial man-eating gelatinous mass is going around consuming countless victims. Like a typical boy cried wolf story, none of the adults believe them until the blob makes a riot at a movie theater. They soon find the creature's weakness (extreme cold) and use it against it.The whole movie is decent. While McQueen's performance is okay, the real star is the blob, who unfortunately has very little screen time and it's not very threatening considering how slow it is. If you want some good old 50s monster fun, be my guest. Just don't expect much from it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have wanted to see this movie for a long time now, as I liked the 1988 remake of The Blob and I expected the original, as tradition has it, to be better than it. Well, it wasn't, but it was something that I've not seen in a long time.Steven McQueen plays this serious kid who finds out about the blob and tries to make everyone believe him and rather failing. It takes a theater of screaming people to wake the people up and make them fight the monster. Maybe one of the first horror movies to place teenagers in a position where they have to convince close-minded adults.Now, the starting theme song is the funniest song ever for a horror movie. I've hummed it obsessively since I've heard it, making me look ridiculous. The blob itself looks like marmalade and Steve's girlfriend seems to have acted well only when he lied the directors that she was an actress. However, the film does have a fresh feeling and the story is fluent and watchable. The end kind of spoils everything, but afterward you can boast you have seen a horror classic.Speaking of the remake: it brought everything the original narrowly missed: the death of the annoying shop owner, the actual special effects showing people dissolving, the attack in the theater, the phone booth, not to mention a cutey like Shawnee Smith who can actually act a little and a Kevin Dillon that really looked like the rebel Steve was supposed to represent. And then the masterpiece of bringing the corrupt and greedy American Army to get slurped.I would really love to see a good remake of The Blob, but I wouldn't wait until 2018 for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Early look at The King of Cool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An interesting note: this year (2004) The Great Escape is being re-released. By coincidence, the film that made Steve McQueen famous is based on a true story-the allied POW officers' escape from Stalag Luft III, which took place on the night of March 24, 1944. March 24 is Steve McQueen's birthday. THE BLOBExcept for one thing, this is a forgettable flick, even in a sea of forgettable 1950s sci-fi flicks. The one thing notable about this film is that it provides an early look at an undeveloped talent in the form of Steven McQueen; later box office mega star Steve McQueen.Many biographies of Steve McQueen note his early career attempts to follow the styles of the late James Dean and Marlon Brando. Like others who tried, McQueen fails badly in this movie. The only young actor to come out of the 1950s using his own unique style from the beginning was fellow Actors' Studio grad, Paul Newman, McQueen's internal personal rival. The Blob gives us a unique view of a young man as he struggles to find himself as an actor. In spite of the film and himself, a number of scenes show the truly great actor that will emerge within five years. Once McQueen learned to just play himself, The Magnificent Seven and The Great Escape (along with a number of other excellent, but lesser publicized, films) established The King of Cool as a box office heavyweight who would ultimately outshine all his rivals. This inner character, McQueen as McQueen, has made him as strong a screen star 24 years after his death as he was in his heyday.Only Clark Gable and John Wayne had stars that continue to shine year after year as McQueen's does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It creeps. And leaps. And glides. And even, you know, slides. Across the floor. Or so the jazzy theme tune by Burt Bacharach and Mack David would have us believe. When I was younger this film had gained a notorious reputation as a horrific shocker, largely by people who were confusing it with the pretty good '88 remake. The original actually turns out to be a rather mild and campy B-Movie. Or is the whole thing a send-up of B-Movies? With its studio recreations of exteriors, dated Technicolor and ropy dubbing, it comes across as a television adaptation. It's quite interesting watching this one side-by-side with the 80s version as both are products of eras that retrospectively lack good taste. Some of the acting here is hokey, but not more so than the mullet-bedecked efforts in Chuck Russell's take. The special effects are dated (especially the cartoon blob on the diner) yet in their own way no more dated than the Dream Quest Image sequences. Differences between the two aren't actually that many, the Kevin Dillon movie being a fairly faithful upgrade. Perhaps this is most notable with the Scooby-Dooish notion of teenagers saving the day, a hot concept in 50s America, a dumb one in 1988. Though the major difference is that this Steve(n) McQueen picture wouldn't have the nerve to present an anti-authoritarian stance. Here the police are loveable guardians, on first-name terms with "the kids". The remake saw the blob re-imagined as a man-made biological weapon. Here there's no such subtext; the creature is merely a murderous parasite from outer space. If there's any commentary to be gleaned, it's seeing all-Americans hiding in a cellar from a growing red menace. The Blob is a curiously middle-aged and exploitative attempt to ensnare a newborn audience. This was the decade where Rock ?n' Roll emerged, the term teenager was invented, and youth was about to find its voice. To this end The Blob finds it target by not just being a movie, but a veritable pop-culture phenomenon.</fullReview>

Trouble is, what can you go on about after the plot? The blob is basically a radical idea, deemed scary on paper but hysterical on film. That's it.

		<shortDescription>The Monster That Almost Ate Steve McQueen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In their small-town "lovers' lane" for an odd "sit up" make-out session, older-looking teenagers Steven "Steve" McQueen (as Steve Andrews) and Aneta Corsaut (as Jane Martin) see an object fall from the nighttime sky. Thereafter, "The Blob" begins to eat veteran actor Olin Howland's hand. Soon, it attacks entire people. As the danger worsens, Mr. McQueen tries to warn authorities, but most people treat him like he's a dumb high school kid. Local lieutenant Earl Rowe (as Dave) is sympathetic, however. You'll have to see if McQueen can stop "The Blob" before it eats everyone and everything in Downingtown...In hindsight, something special is noted by the fact that the starring role is played by 1960s-70s super-star Steve McQueen, but he's one of the film's most obvious liabilities; miscast thus unconvincing in an underwhelming and inappropriate role. Others fall in line, with the other actors faring similarly. The script wisely favors youth, considering the film's indented audience. The poorly realized story combines the "communist menace" subtext with the "generation gap". The Bacharach/David novelty theme song was a minor Top 40 hit and remains catchy. The monster special effect works okay for the genre, and it is in color.**** The Blob (9/10/58) Irvin S. Yeaworth Jr. ~ Steve McQueen, Aneta Corsaut, Earl Rowe, John Benson</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blob, The (1958) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Cheesy but classic sci-fi tale has two teenagers (Steve McQueen, Aneta Corsaut) trying to convince the police and their parents that the meteor that fell to eat was carrying the title creature, a monster that absorbs people. Being a decade for teen movies there were quite a few that had them seeing a monster yet not having anyone believe them so on that level this film isn't too original but on an entertainment level I think this is one of the best out there. The film has an ultra low-budget but that doesn't hamper the film at all as it looks very good and professional. The special effects of the blob are pretty good for their time even though some of the longer shots are obviously fake. What makes the film so much fun is that "no one will believe us" mentality that the kids must battle along with the parents not believing them and the fact that they have to figure out a way to kill the monster. Added fun comes from seeing McQueen doing a movie like this. I've read he wasn't too thrilled with doing a movie like this but he certainly gives it his all and manages to turn in a good, if somewhat over the top, performance. He was 28 at the time of filming so having him play a teenager is a bit of a stretch but again, it doesn't take away from any of the fun. Another plus is that the film is in color, which was a rather rare thing for this type of movie, which were usually in B&amp;W. Yet another strong aspect is the ending, which is just downright classic as the blob goes after people in a movie theater, which just happens to be showing a horror double feature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I'm not particularly fond of cheesy old horror or petticoats, and I've never thought Steve McQueen was worth watching. But this small film has a special place in my memory. Like the superior `Tingler' of the following year (which I experienced in `percepto') it is a horror movie which features a climax at a horror movie. This idea would evolve into many folds until it hit the complexities of `Blair Witch 2` or `Ringu.'It didn't start here - the notion traces back to Keaton's `Sherlock Jr.' But as a horror device, it is in its purest form here, almost as pure as janeygirl.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I checked out this little flick from the library not expecting too much since it was made before good special events were even a blip on the radar. Granite, at the time these were good effects, but compared w/what can be done now, they aren't very good.Well, if you don't know, a meteor lands on earth and when an old farmer finds it, it breaks open and "The Blob" takes an attraction to his hand. Think about that sticky stuff on the back of insert cards in magazines that when you roll it up looks like a booger and you can't get it off. Anyway, a couple of kids find him and take him to a doctor where the space "being" begins to take over the town getting bigger as it kills.The movie honestly wasn't that bad I have definitly seen worse. Especially ones that were made in that time period. My next mission is to check out the remakes and see how those hold up.My recomendation: Go to your local library and check out as many horror DVDs as you can find. You don't have to spend in money and you get to see some you wouldn't normally watch. Or of course you could just rent them.I'll give 2 1/2 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Believe it or not, this is one of the really great ideas of science fiction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a nice trifle by Robert Sheckley called `The Leech' (published 1952) which handles the same idea rather well, and I'm sure the same could be a dozen other stories. Consult a science fiction historian and watch the list grow.Basically, the idea is that there is this THING, preferably from outer space, that grows and grows and grows, and does precious little else. It never seems a threat at first. (This particular `blob' is the size of a tennis ball when it lands.) It eats whatever items are used to try to defeat it (in this case, human beings), and usually humanity is just one step behind in the arms race. `When it first arrived a flyswatter could have killed it. Now it's just a little too late for the flyswatter: we'll have to use machine guns. As it turns out we used the guns a little too late. We'll have to use a tank. No, we'll have to use nukes. Or is it too late even for them?'But anyone who thinks this film is a classic simply because it makes use of such a powerful myth has rocks in his head. It makes such POOR use of the myth. To be blunt: it doesn't have a clue what it's doing. Far too much screen time is devoted to the local teenagers (headed by Steve McQueen, these teenagers have to be seen to be believed). The blob itself sits in the background for so long that one starts to wonder if the screenwriters have forgotten about it. Then there's a long and pointless dispute with the police over something or other ... And what's with that title song? It makes the blob sound positively jolly.Anyone selling copies of the video ought to place a sticker on the cover: `of historical interest only'. Still, it's hard to be too harsh on bad science fiction of the 1950s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple little horror film is earnestly acted and quite effective...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I concede that this little horror flick gains distinction from being one of STEVE McQUEEN's earliest acting efforts, it's amusing to note that at IMDb it has attracted more comments than other much worthier films from the 1950s which are left with something like two pages of comments at the most.I guess its strongest appeal is to the teens and young adults who crave a good scare now and then even if it is on a shoestring budget and the whole project strains credibility.It does hold the attention throughout, but the ending is somewhat of a letdown and much too abrupt. Without going into plot details, let's just say it's an uphill struggle for McQueen and his teen friends to get any of the townspeople to believe their story about The Blob until the monster brings his menace to a midnight horror show in the heart of town.All of the supporting actors are competent enough although there are no names in the low-budget cast. Steve McQueen shows his characteristic spunk and determination and rivets attention with his intense blue-eyed stare.Summing up: The kind of early sci-fi film that inspires kids (and some adults) today to use the word "cheesy" when describing its special effects.</fullReview>

The dialog in this movie is ridiculous at times, and will make you laugh or cringe...Not much gore in this movie, compared to the remake.

		<shortDescription>See the world's oldest teenagers battle a monster from space!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very famous 50s sci-fi film that was indifferently remade in the 1980s. It stars Steven McQueen (age 28) and Aneta Corsaut (25) as teenagers(!) who discover a strange blob-like thing from outer space. However, when they go to the police, the cops mostly think it's all a teenage prank and there is no obvious evidence that the monster has already eaten the doctor and his assistant. While McQueen and Corsaut (who played "Helen" on THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW) did fine jobs acting, they looked nothing like real teenagers and it make me smile every time the panic was being blamed on "those crazy kids"! This is a very simple story idea and has been repeated many times--an alien lands and the "kids" see it but no one believes them, such as in INVASION OF THE SAUCER MEN. However, this low-budget film worked better than most because somehow everything worked well--the monster was simple but effective, the acting better than usual and somehow they had enough money to afford to actually film it in color. A very effective and fun film--though one that fuddy-duddies and ultra-serious people should avoid.By the way, the title song is very, very catchy and goofy and was written by Burt Bacharach. I heard it for the first time at the Sci-Fi Dine-In restaurant at the Disney-Hollywood Studios in Orlando, Florida. At this amazingly cool retro restaurant, you sit in fake 50s cars with tables and these "cars" all face a giant screen on which old fashioned sci-fi clips are shown. Among the many clips and cartoons is a music video of sorts featuring this catchy song. If you ever get to the park, try this place. The food it okay but the atmosphere is amazing and perfect for people who love this genre.Also, this film was part of a double-feature with another great 50s sci-fi film (and one of my favorites) I MARRIED A MONSTER FROM OUTER SPACE. What a terrific double-billing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm still avoiding the 50's and the 60's because that's an era for me that bored me with out of date effects and a lot of blah blah horrors. Strange because I like the old school a lot, my collection starts from the first movies and I mean the really first ones from the 19th century. If you watch closer you will find a gap between the 40's and the 70's. But now and then I suffer myself to watch a classic from that era. I am familiar with Steve McQueen but he couldn't convince me in this flick. Sometimes he is just acting so theatrical my God, you should see it. Also for that era is the cheap editing. Watch the beginning, you see a 2 shot, when they cut to the close up the head is in another position, due my work I notice those things. Also typical is the night sequences shot in brought daylight with ND filters before the lenses. The effects used at the diner and the cinema is pure cardboard, those old classics were better done, remember Nosferatu raising from the grave...And those conversations, man, the city is in deep trouble and they are talking to Steve who is captured by the Blob by phone in an easy talking, nothing happens. I will stop now, as said, that era is surely not my cup of tea, sorry</fullReview>

While the concept behind the movie was a natural vehicle for a classic teeny bopper sci-fi flick, the director counted too heavily on it to carry the movie. It's clear he was working with no money, because the entire movie is loaded with bloated dialogue that goes on and on forever. I have *never* seen so much time-killing in a movie.There are probably less than 60 seconds of "blob footage" in the entire movie, and most of the rest of it is people engaging in a lot of poorly-written, run-on dialogue.

Most of the acting is really hammy and the dialogue corny but this only adds to the amusement.Steve Mcqueen is not bad though,although i did hear that he hated this film.I was watching the Blob on the Sci-fi channel the other day after having a few drinks and i found myself really laughing out loud at it.I highly recommend this film to any one who wants a good laugh at an unintentionally funny film.</fullReview>

I'm sorry, but it doesn't hold up (if it ever did at all) and is a boring and mostly "Blob-less" chore to hang around with.It's a pity that it starts off so superbly and quickly lapses into endless talk and non-monster dullness. The whole idea is brilliant, with a meteor crashing to earth to reveal an oozing mass of gelatin that eats people. Our interest peaks immediately with the old man's discovery of said meteorite, and his tragic rush to a town doctor for emergency treatment...but then things get tedious in a hurry.If this film hadn't been shot in such vibrant color I doubt it would be so revered today. It can't hold a candle to dozens of far worthier 1950's monster flicks. The Blob itself is quite menacing for what it is, but the overall effect is one of a sadly missed opportunity. Ultimately, THE BLOB is a creeping bore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a pretty high standard now for garbage-y movies. A movie has to be especially bad to knock off any of the current despised movies on my list. The Blob is positively awful for anything but inspiring you to insert vulgar lines between the bits of dialog. Although it's also possible that the movie is actually an ingenious tool to bore the living crap out of your date in 1958, so that making out with you seems like a decent alternative. As far as "bad" goes, I don't think I've ever seen a less artfully made movie. I also don't think it's possible to make a less artful movie in the future.A gelatinous space-turd grows as it eats the members of a town, while a cast of actors tries to outrebel 'Rebel Without a Cause.' Characters are so dense they can't even figure out they can stroll leisurely away from the largely immobile title organism. You'd actually have to watch an episode of Mr Ed to see worse writing than on display here. The plot progresses at a snails pace while characters process their thoughts at roughly the speed of a lumber flow. The movie is oddly obsessed with minutia; no one makes a move in this 'movie' until they announce it four times, discuss it twice, and have another character authorize it.Anyone in this movie, or anyone who went to see it and was entertained, has too much lead in their diet. If people were this dull and dim-witted in the 50s it would have single-handedly caused kinky sex to be invented. Somehow you can't buy a DVD of Zentropa or The Magnificent Ambersons but this dreck is available from the Criterion Collection!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The interstellar pudding's night on the town!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never once before in my life thought I would say this, but there's actually an 80's horror remake that I enjoyed more than the original! The 1988 update for "The Blob", by director Chuck Russell, widely surpasses the 1958 original and that's not exclusively because it got released in a decade when visual &amp; special effects had remarkably advanced. The original simply isn't a very good film, despite being considered as a minor genre classic by several critics and fans. The script suffers from severe pacing problems from start to finish, the character drawings are very implausible and overall the atmosphere completely lacks the typical 50's charm that other Sci-Fi milestones featured. As you probably know by now, "The Blob" revolves on a meteorite that crashes down in a remote American town and its substance ? a thick and funky red kind of jelly ? consumes the villagers in order to increase in size. Teenagers in love Steve and Jane face huge difficulties when trying to convince the rest of the town of what exactly is happening. One of the many reasons why I'm such a sucker for old (50's ? 60's ? 70's) Science Fiction movies is because of the sublime portrayal of mass hysteria and paranoia. Titles like "War of the Worlds" and even "Day of the Triffids" were great because the fear on people's faces looked so real! "The Blob" doesn't feature this tension, mainly because the intergalactic pudding takes over the earth so damn slow! It pays a visit to the doctor's office first, moves on to a cozy little restaurant and continues his journey to the local theater, but it pretty much avoids all the obvious public places. That's why it also takes too long before the teenagers can convince the rest of the population of the danger. The blob in the aforementioned 80's remake follows the same path but its threatening presence is much clearer. The blob here appears to be on a sightseeing tour instead of on a conquest to invade our planet. Another negative element here is the casting choice of the hero. As much as I like Steve McQueen, he simply can't pass for a rebellious teenager who spends his Friday nights on lover's lane watching the stars. McQueen was 28 when this film was shot and he already looks older, so his youthful behavior wasn't very convincing. In the 80's remake, Kevin Dillon's character was a social outcast that constantly was in trouble with the law and thus much more plausible. Is there still anything left to recommend? Yes, of course! The basic idea of an alien monster looking like shapeless blubber, and thus different than the usual spaceships or Martians, was quite original and special effects are rather engaging. It's not much, but I hate to be entirely negative about an influential movie like this.</fullReview>

The ending was pitifully trite; obviously the producers were leaving the door open for a sequel....and there were many. Thumbs down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the least scary film i have ever seen. How the blob manages to eat anyone is the biggest mystery of the film. The blob moves so slowly that an o.a.p in a zimmerframe could escape it. The blob has a large slice of luck coming across a typical horror film woman who instead of running away stands still for half an hour so that she can be eaten. If you havent seen this film i recommend you do, its far too funny to be taken seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Blob starts with one of the most bizarre theme songs ever, sung by an uncredited Burt Bacharach of all people! You really have to hear it to believe it, The Blob may be worth watching just for this song alone &amp; my user comment summary is just a little taste of the classy lyrics... After this unnerving opening credits sequence The Blob introduces us, the viewer that is, to Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen as Steven McQueen) &amp; his girlfriend Jane Martin (Aneta Corsaut) who are parked on their own somewhere &amp; witness what looks like a meteorite falling to Earth in nearby woods. An old man (Olin Howland as Olin Howlin) who lives in a cabin also sees it &amp; goes to investigate, he finds a crater &amp; a strange football sized rock which splits open when he unwisely pokes it with a stick. Laying in the centre of the meteorite is a strange jelly like substance which sticks to the stick, if you know what I mean! It then slides up the stick &amp; attachés itself to the old man's hand. Meanwhile Steve &amp; Jane are quietly driving along minding their own business when the old man runs out in front of Steve's car, Steve being a decent kinda guy decides to take the old man to Dr. T. Hallan (Alden 'Stephen' Chase as Steven Chase) at the local surgery. Dr. Hallan says he doesn't know what the substance on the old man's hand is but it's getting bigger &amp; asks Steve to go back where he found him &amp; see if he can find out what happened. Steve agrees but doesn't come up with anything &amp; upon returning to Dr. Hallan's surgery he witnesses the blob devouring him. The town's police, Lieutenant Dave (Earl Rowe) &amp; the teenage hating Sergeant Jim Bert (John Benson) unsurprisingly don't believe a word of it &amp; end up suspecting Steve &amp; his mates Al (Anthony Franke), Tony (Robert Fields) &amp; someone called 'Mooch' Miller (James Bonnet) of playing an elaborate practical joke on the police department. However as the blob continues to eat it's way through the town Steve sets about finding proof of it's existence &amp; convincing the police about the threat it posses not just to their town but the entire world!Directed Irvin S. Yeaworth Jr. &amp; an uncredited Russell S. Doughton Jr. I was throughly disappointed by this, the original 1958 version of The Blob. The script by Kay Linaker as Kate Phillips &amp; Theodore Simonson is an absolute bore &amp; extremely dull not making the most of it's strongest aspects. The Blob focuses on the tiresome dramatics &amp; conflicts between the teenagers &amp; police, in fact the majority of The Blob is spent on Steve trying to convince the police of the blob's existence. For most of the film the blob itself almost seems inconsequential &amp; somewhat forgotten. It only has two or three scenes for the fist hour &amp; a bit until the less than exciting climax when the adults &amp; teenagers have to work together to defeat the blob &amp; have a new found appreciation of each other afterwards, yuck! Why couldn't the blob just eat the lot of 'em? No explanation is given for what the blob is or it's origins other than it came from space, how long did it take them to come up with that? The dialogue is clunky &amp; silly as well, as are people's actions &amp; decision making, I love the part when a nurse named Kate (Lee Paton as Lee Payton, did anyone use their real name in this thing?) is confronted by the blob, she throws some acid over it &amp; calmly proclaims "Doctor, nothing will stop it!", how does she know 'nothing' will stop it exactly? There's no blood or violence so don't worry about that, the special effects on the blob itself aren't too bad considering but it barely has any screen time &amp; moves very slowly, a bit like the film in general actually. The acting is terrible, McQueen is supposed to be a teenager when in reality he was 28 years old &amp; it shows, he looks old enough to be his own dad! Same thing goes for most of the other 'teenage' cast members &amp; everyone generally speaking are wooden &amp; unconvincing in their roles. Technically The Blob is very basic, dark static photography, dull direction &amp; forgettable production values. The Blob is one of those films that probably sounds good on paper &amp; is well known as being a 'classic' but is in actual fact a huge disappointment when finally seen. This is one case when the remake The Blob (1988) is definitely better than the original. The original Blob is slow &amp; boring &amp; the remake isn't, the original Blob contains no blood or gore &amp; the remake does, the original Blob has incredibly poor acting &amp; casting decisions &amp; the remake doesn't &amp; the original Blob itself gets very little screen time eating only three or four people throughout the entire film &amp; the remake features the blob all the way through &amp; it virtually eats an entire town. The choice is an easy one, the remake every time as it's a better film in every respect. I'll give the film two stars &amp; give that wonderful main theme song one on it's own. Definitely not the classic many seem to make out.</fullReview>
