		<fullReview>Rico Bandello, a petty crook nicknamed LITTLE CAESAR, plots his rise to become crime boss of the Big City.Edward G. Robinson made a tremendous impact in this star-making saga of a thoroughly detestable little man who bandies his way through society's underbelly for a short time until fate brings him his just reward. The evil spawn of a deplorable age, Rico cares for neither booze nor dames, only pure raw power. Even loyalty &amp; friendship are weaknesses to be deplored since no one can be ultimately trusted. Robinson, with his frightening eyes and large ugly mouth, makes this human scum fascinating to watch - a cheap little monster in expensive suits, a moral nonentity with a big gun.Douglas Fairbanks Jr does a fine job with what little the script gives him as Rico's longtime buddy; the bland nature of his performance contrasts nicely to Robinson's florid acting style. Even more compelling is Glenda Farrell in an important early role as Fairbanks' girlfriend - this talented actress would soon become one of Hollywood's premiere tough talking brassy blondes.Stanley Fields, Sidney Blackmer &amp; George E. Stone all deliver vivid portraits of crooks &amp; criminals that Rico must intimidate or use. Special mention should be made of William Collier Jr who gives a touching portrayal as the mob's getaway driver who loses his nerve and attempts to go straight.Movie mavens will recognize an unbilled Lucille La Verne as the old crone who intimidates Rico near the end of the picture.With LITTLE CAESAR and PUBLIC ENEMY (1931) Warner Brothers established themselves as the Studio that could produce topnotch, gritty crime dramas. The reputation was well deserved and the films were appreciated by movie viewers already enthralled by the headline exploits of real life Depression desperadoes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Is this the end of Rico?" - Yes, But the Start of My Favorite Genre - Mob Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LITTLE CAESAR was made at a critical time in U.S. history. Prohibition was in, the depression was overwhelming, and mobsters were running rampant. I don't think the filmmakers realized it, but they have made a movie that paints the "Mafia" as glamorous and flashy. A message appears before the flick, telling the public how "we" must stop gangsters like Tom Powers (James Cagney,PUBLIC ENEMY) and Rico, (Edward G. Robinson, LITTLE CAESAR). The movie probably had youngsters and adults alike wanting to live the life of a man who had a city in his grasp, and no one who was anyone was "yellow". All seriousness aside, this blueprint of a long history of mob pictures is silly, dated, and damn watchable. You can't take your eyes off the screen.A film with dialogue like the ultimate cliche "Go on. I'm...done for" must be a waste of time right? Not if you appreciate pre-historic cinema and the Vitaphone films of the early talkie period. Actors like the great Edward G. Robinson were born to talk and deliver lines at machine gun pace. This is what the audiences of the time were looking for. And that mug. Audiences would not see such a face on a gangster until Brando's GODFATHER. If you love GOODFELLAS, THE GODFATHER, Cagney and Bogart films, and even PULP FICTION, this is a must see. Experience an American original - the first potent "La Cosa Nostra" movie.

		<fullReview>Technically it is not the first gangster movie. D.W.Griffith's MUSKETEERS OF PIG ALLEY was, and after that there were films in the silent period dealing with gangs and crime. But the cycle of anti-hero gangsters began in the sound period with LITTLE CAESAR (1930/31) followed by THE PUBLIC ENEMY (1931) and SCARFACE: SHAME OF THE NATION (1932). Each made a movie star out of the lead actor: Edward G. Robinson as Enrico Bandello in LITTLE CAESAR; James Cagney as Tom Powers in THE PUBLIC ENEMY; and Paul Muni as Tony Carmonte in SCARFACE.The interesting thing about these three sound classics is that the central anti-heroes are not the same (except in their willing use of violence). Cagney enjoys the violence as much as Muni, but Cagney has a great sense of loyalty to his friends and a deep love for his mother. Muni respects his mother, but his family love is centered on his sister (Ann Dvorak), and his loyalty to friends ends the moment he suspects they are no longer obeying him or are threatening him. And Robinson? He has no close contact with any family in the story (his last words are addressed to the Virgin Mary ("Mother of mercy"), not his own mother), and never has a girlfriend (a fact made more clear in the novel). However, he has very strong feeling dealing with his close friend Joe Massara (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.), and actually hesitates only once in killing anyone: when he might have to shoot Joe to get at Joe's girlfriend Olga (Glenda Farrell). Suddenly his eyes get teary - one wonders how close he felt towards Fairbanks. His loyal associate, Otero (George E. Stone) does not hesitate to try to shoot Fairbanks, and he wounds him, but they are forced to flee before Otero can finish the job. Interestingly, Rico/Robinson is not as moved when Otero, fatally wounded, tells him to flee a scene or two afterward.The gangs in PUBLIC ENEMY and SCARFACE are successful and organized, but we never fully see this. Not so in LITTLE CAESAR. One critical approach to the film has likened it and the rise of Rico to Andrew Carnegie's advise to young businessmen at the turn of the century. And we do see the organization going from Joe and Rico and Otero to Sam to Diamond Pete Montana to "the Big Boy" (who lives in a mansion with accoutrements). Interestingly when the gang is destroyed, the news of the trials and executions do not include Montana (who has always kept a low profile - he never has his picture taken), or "the Big Boy". The ones who learn the rules of corporate America, as applied to crime gangs, survive: the Lucianos and Costellos, not the Siegels or Anastasias or Schultzs.The film set stardom for Robinson, although (like Cagney, but oddly not like Muni) Robinson was stuck mostly in crime movies in the 1930s. It wasn't until the later 1930s that he was able to show he could play other types of characters, although even when not a gangster he was cast as the villain (THE SEA WOLF). He never did win an Oscar for this part, still his best known), but he did have a long distinguished career in movies, capped (after his last film, the under appreciated SOYLENT GREEN, with a life achievement Oscar. Not bad for a man whose best known character died in a gutter wondering why he was ending this way instead of on top.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated, And Some Acting Suspect, But Still Good Viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boy, is this gangster movie dated but Edward G. Robinson makes it so entertaining! Robinson, like James Cagney, can dominate a film. He certainly does that in this movie, and is sure fun to watch as "Enrico Bandello."Everything about the movie, including the DVD transfer (although a lot better than the VHS) is dated-looking and sounding, but that helps make it interesting. The dialog is so passe that it's almost weird. I put on the English subtitles so I could understand everything because the slang of those days is something foreign to us nowadays. The different expressions of the day are fun to hear (and read).The acting by the man (Thomas Jackson?) who plays the main cop is also strange, very wooden-like. He just didn't sound natural. Some of the other actors were likewise, others were fine. It was one of the early "talkies" so maybe things were still needed to be smoothed out, film-wise and acting-wise. In other words, some of the actors sounded professional and others amateurish.The following year, James Cagney's "Public Enemy" came out and was much better, production-wise. What a big difference in the camera-work, for one. This film may not be the caliber of "Public Enemy" but it's still good and one to have in your collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still holds up very well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seminal gangster film about the rise and fall of Enrico Bandello, a Chicago hoodlum, based on the novel by W.R. Burnett. The prototype for Enrico was, like so many other gangster heroes, mobster Al Capone. If you know a little bit about his life story, you got your basic gangster plot for practically all films that followed, like Tony Camonte in SCARFACE.This film was the first of "the big three", together with PUBLIC ENEMY (1931) and SCARFACE: SHAME OF THE NATION (1932) and provided the blueprint for the modern gangster crime flic. It was the first gangster film to reach a wide audience and launched Edward G. Robinson to stardom. The story is simple and straightforward and might feel a little overly familiar to modern audiences, but the film lost little of its power and still holds up pretty well. It's a tough movie, but mostly tough talking with not much violence on screen. But the film would probably be instantly forgettable without Robinson's superb performance. Whenever he's on screen, his presence is incredibly menacing. The rest of the cast is so so, but Thomas Jackson as Flaherty, Rico's nemesis, gives a wonderfully cynical performance, mocking Rico and all the other gangsters. Like most other early gangster films, it lacks the real emotional depth and complexity that came with later films, like the French gangster films of the fifties or THE GODFATHER and was made primarily as popular entertainment. Pleasant entertainment nevertheless with Edward G. Robinson portraying the first classic gangster role in screen history.Camera Obscura --- 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: This review may reveal some scenes of the movie!In the film that made Edward G. Robinson a star, we get to see one of the nastiest, meanest characters ever put on film. As "Rico," Robinson plays a no-holds barred gangster. As an example, at one point he believes one of his gang is feeling guilty and going to the priest to confess...so he guns him down on the steps of the church.I first started watching the film simply because I'm a bit of a film buff and felt that it should be a film I see, regardless of how good (or bad) it might be. But by the end of the film, I had been pulled into the story. It revolves around a small-time thug and his buddy who go to the city to make it big. Soon Rico is muscling in on the "big guys" turf, taking over his territory with his own brand of shoot first, ask questions later. I could tell you more, but you should see the movie instead.Robinson is great in the film. Toward the end of the film there is an amazing shot of just his face, staring into the camera -- no words, no other characters, just Robinson as Rico, and you get a chance to see truly great acting! Just the mood he creates with his eyes alone in this one shot is worth seeing the entire film. Throw in a good storyline, an entire gang of thugs who are terrified of the chief thug, great direction, and you wind up with a great film. And don't worry parents -- this is still a film from 1930, so there is no sex, no language, and even the majority of the violence (which is minimal considering this is a film about the mob!) is hidden from sight. Even the ones you see have no blood involved -- just the sound of a gun and a person slumps over to die.When you see a film like this on a station like Turner Classic Movies, you get the added benefit of additional trivia. According to the introduction, the book upon which this movie was based was written after the author, listening to a friend of his sing on the radio live from a local club, was gunned down on the air when the mob broke into the club with Tommy guns blazing. Imagine the shock of hearing your friend killed live on the radio...Finally, during the introduction of the film it was also stated that at the time of release, complaints were made that the film glorified the mob and their violent ways. I disagree. If Robinson's portrayal doesn't turn you off of violence and the mob, then you probably aren't human -- which is probably exactly the point of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mother of mercy, is this the end of Rico?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With those words, Edward G dies in a hail of bullets, a man who has fallen to the gutter from the hierarchy of the crime boss. This is the essential gangster film which set the standard for those that followed. The film is now 73 years old and still never fails to amaze you because of the performance by it's star. Robinson, a former player in the Yiddish theater, certainly wasn't physically attractive and his voice and mannerisms begged to be parodied. It was those very things that made him the premier gangster of the 30's.....and as his career matured he tempered his performances.The story revolves around Rico and his compatriots as they move up in the world......some are left behind either by choice (as with Fairbanks) or they simply are "rubbed out" as Little Caesar climbs the crime corporate ladder. His downfall is rapid and extreme and his final home is a flophouse.The supporting cast is strong and includes two of my personal favorites, the ubiquitous George E. Stone and the sassy Glenda Farrell.It must be said that some of the performances are a bit overdone but we must remember that this was 1931 and sound was new to the movies. Actors had not quite adapted to the more restrained acting needed for film. Nevertheless, Little Caesar is the touchstone of the crime film. It merits repeated viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rise and Fall of Cesar Enrico Bandello</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LITTLE CAESAR (First National Pictures, 1930, released early January 1931), directed by Mervyn LeRoy, from the novel by W.R. Burnett, is not a movie dealing with the history of the pizza franchise, but a pioneer gangster melodrama of an underworld thug who rises to the leadership of a powerful gang. Although not the first gangster story captured on film nor the first gangster role enacted by Edward G. Robinson, the film set the standard for gangster films to come. As one of the few movies released during the early sound era to still hold interest today, the true success of LITTLE CAESAR is the casting of Robinson in the title role, referred to on many occasions as Rico, or his full name of Cesar Enrico Bandello. There's no question that Robinson, a fine actor with the "bulldog" face, is the ideal choice when it comes to playing gangster-types. Within a year, Warners produced another legendary actor with another underworld story, THE PUBLIC ENEMY (1931). His name, James Cagney.LITTLE CAESAR, usually compared with THE PUBLIC ENEMY, would become companion pieces when reissued later in the decade each intact with a forward introduction that reads, "Perhaps the toughest of the gangster films, LITTLE CAESAR and THE PUBLIC ENEMY had a great effect on public opinion. They brought home violently the evils and associate with prohibition and suggested that necessity of the nationwide of house-cleaning. Tom Powers in THE PUBLIC ENEMY and Rico in LITTLE CAESAR are not two men or are they nearly characters. They are a problem that sooner or later, we, the public, must solve." Unlike its rival, THE PUBLIC ENEMY, Rico is ambitious and power hungry from the start, and kills those who betray or stand in his way while Cagney's Tom Powers character is a cold-blooded killer who does away with some of his victims for the fun of it.Aside from Robinson's memorable performance and his occasional repeated catch phrase, "You can dish it out, but you can't take it," LITTLE CAESAR is full of classic scenes: Rico's introduction to "the boys" through the use of high range camera angles; the New Year's Eve robbery of a Bronze Peacock Night Club where Rico's best pal, Joe Massara (Douglas Fairbank Jr.) works as a dancer, and selected as a lookout for the gang by standing by the cigarette counter at the stroke of midnight; Rico's termination of a cowardly Tony Passa (William Collier Jr.) in front of the church steps after wanting to break from the gang and to seek help from his parish priest, Father McNeil; Rico's near machine-gun assassination attempt by a rival gang ordered by leader Little Arnie Lorch (Maurice Black) after purchasing a bundle of newspapers headlining his honorary banquet event; Rico's confrontation with Joe for betraying him for the sake of a woman, Olga Stassoff (Glenda Farrell), only to find he is unable to gun them both; Rico's reaching bottom by sleeping in a flop house, appearing dirty, teary eyed and in need of a shave; Rico eluding his capture by Flaherty; and the most famous closing line in movie history, "Mother of Mercy, is this the end of Rico?" While portions of LITTLE CAESAR may appear primitive to contemporary viewers with its early use of sound technology, such as echos from spoken dialogue between the two main characters (Robinson and Fairbanks) in a diner, and others either in office or police station; or Vitaphone orchestration (by Erno Rapee) commonly heard in early talkies; or the lack of the sight of blood following the shooting of intended victims. The real topper comes from Glenda Farrell's little girl sounding voice as she shouts, "Happy New Year" to Joe Masarra. Her brief dancing segment with Joe to the underscoring of "If I'm Dreaming, Don't Wake Me Too Soon" (from the 1929 motion picture musical, SALLY, starring Marilyn Miller) is performed in long shot camera range. It's possible that doubles were substituted for Fairbanks and Farrell, considering the fact they aren't quite believable to be taken for professional dancers.With a fine cast of supporting actors, ranging from gang members to crime bosses to police commissioners, include Stanley Fields as Sam Vetorri, gang boss who keeps his office at the Club Palermo; Armand Kaliz as DeVoss; George E. Stone as Otero; Sidney Blackmer as "Big Boy"; Ralph Ince as Diamond Pete Montana; Maurice Black as Little Arnie Lorch; and Noel Madison as Peppi. Look fast for character actress Lucille LaVerne, appearing without screen credit, in an extended cameo as "Ma" Magdalena, as tough old hag of a woman (plus a minor touch of an Italian accent), who makes a lasting impression as the only character in the story to stand up to Rico with fierce eyes and get away with it. And speaking of memorable impressions, top acting honors also goes to Thomas E. Jackson as Inspector Tom Flaherty with his distinctive snarling or nasal-tone voice supplying funny one liners ("Why didn't you come to Sam's neck stretching party, Rico? It was a BIG success!").At the time of production, Edward G. Robinson probably thought LITTLE CAESAR to be just another movie assignment for him. Never in his wildest dreams did he imagine this was to be permanently linked to him. The continued success of LITTLE CAESAR and Edward G. Robinson, which began playing on commercial television during the late night or mid-afternoon hours for several decades, continues to find a new audience whenever broadcast on Turner Classic Movies (sometimes as a double bill with THE PUBLIC ENEMY), where it was selected at one point in time as part of its weekly showcase, "The Essentials." Also distributed on video cassette and later DVD, LITTLE CAESAR is one vintage crime story that has stood the test of time. (*** machine guns)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Little Caesar" is worth seeing, but I should warn you all, it seems pretty silly by today's standards. Chronicling the rise of Enrico Cesare "Rico" Bandello (Edward G. Robinson), there's everything that one can expect in a gangster movie: a lot of shooting and a lot of hot "dames".The movie isn't a zero or anything; it's just that the whole thing is a little cartoonish. The actual plot sort of seems second to Rico's nasal accent, sometimes beginning and ending his sentences with "eh" and "see?", respectively. It essentially began the gangster movie as we know it today. But we have come a long way since then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Gets Lonely at the Top</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Little Caesar which popularized both the gangster film and Edward G. Robinson is a great study in the criminal mindset and the ruthlessness it takes to get to the top of that world. After all in White Heat look at the epitaph James Cagney gave to his career.We meet Robinson and a friend Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. in some greasy spoon in the middle of nowhere. Fairbanks wants to go into dancing, but Robinson knows exactly what he wants. He wants to rise to the top of the criminal world. Not for riches or fame, but simply raw naked power. As he says to have a bunch of guys working for you who will do ANYTHING you say. The more men you have doing that, the more powerful you are.And the film is a study in the rise and fall of Robinson in his chosen field. But the top is a lonely place.It's been said there's an undercurrent of homosexuality running in Little Caesar between Robinson and Fairbanks by some critics. I've never subscribed to that point of view. In doing what he's doing Robinson essentially cuts himself off from all kind of human contact. His only other attachment is the fawning George E. Stone from his gang. Robinson needs Fairbanks as a friend and confidante. We all need that, someone we can unbend with and show our true feelings, even if it's confiding our criminal ambitions. But as the plot develops Fairbanks who's been on the fringe of Robinson's activities, meets Glenda Farrell and they fall in love. And through her partially Fairbanks develops a conscience about what he's seen. How Robinson deals with it and what becomes of everyone involved is for those interested in viewing the film. But after over 70 years, Little Caesar holds up very well because of its universal theme.Loneliness at the top is an occupational hazard for all ambitious people. It's never expressed in such raw terms as in the gangster film genre. But it's still used. Used in fact in both the Paul Muni version of Scarface and in Al Pacino's version as well.Mervyn LeRoy did a fine job in directing this groundbreaking piece of entertainment. Robinson's portrayal once seen is never forgotten.</fullReview>

The rise and fall of Rico and his dealings with rival gangs and pushing his way to the top makes for a classic. Very good supporting cast featuring:Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Sidney Blackner, Glenda Ferrell and George E. Stone. Robinson makes this role memorable for the ages.

		<shortDescription>His Glory Was Fleeting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the first mobster to make a big dent in cinema, Rico "Little Caesar" Bandello deserves respect. But does he make for a great movie? I say no.After a final gas station hold-up, Rico (Edward G. Robinson) and pal Joe Massara (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.) breeze into the big city to score with mob boss Sam Vettori (Stanley Fields) and his crew. Soon Rico is the one running things, but will his itchy trigger finger and habitual line-stepping run him afoul of police Sergeant Flaherty (Thomas E. Jackson)?"The bigger they come, the harder the fall," Rico boasts. "I ain't doin' bad in this business so far."The problem with "Little Caesar" is obvious from the start and more so as the film progresses: Rico is an idiot. He only makes it as far as he does because all the hoods he messes with, like Sam, are even dumber. When he takes over Sam's gang, he just tells Sam he's through and that's that. When he wants to make a statement about running things, he throws a party and invites the papers. When he starts shooting, he zaps the new crime commissioner and then tells everyone to mind not to say nothing about it.Maybe if the film showed this to be dumb behavior, I'd feel a little different. But instead this is suggested as being the typical road to hoodlum hegemony, and highly effective if not for a human foible or two that slip Rico up.Robinson stands out in the flawed proceedings almost as much by default as by his considerable talent. He's great with his rough banter, and his flourishes with his cigar, but he is playing a Snidley Whiplash caricature and it shows.It reminds me of another Romanian-born actor who made his big splash in movies the same year, Bela Lugosi in "Dracula." Both films are atmospheric potboilers focused on a single over-the-top villain. Both are sadly diminished by time with their formulaic conventions, weak supporting cast, and creaky early-sound production.When "Little Caesar" wants to project menace, we see Rico warn people "my gun's gonna speak its piece," only he doesn't really do much with it. Fairbanks is lost as a lamb in a hurricane playing Joe, especially when he hooks up with Glenda Farrell and tries to make his break from Rico, a matter the film pushes into the background until the last 15 minutes. Watching Fairbanks and Farrell have their clinches reminds you of what was so wrong with early talkies: Even in a clinch, the lovers always shouted at each other.Though a Pre-Code film, "Little Caesar" makes strange concessions to regional censors. When someone is shot, director Mervyn LeRoy is careful not to show Rico or anyone else actually pulling the trigger. There's no mention of booze, or vice, or any other illegal activity. Apparently these guys make all their money holding up each other's parties.Critics looking at the film today scrape for matters of interest such as Rico's possible homosexuality, and the matter of how mob activity might be seen as mirroring big business. But in the end, what you get here is a thin story featuring a character who defies gravity and convention without doing very much of anything interesting.Maybe I should be more grateful to "Little Caesar" for paving the way to other, better gangster films of the 1930s. By itself it is a curio more than anything else, testament to one big talent who left a lasting impression but would make his mark on better films to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First of the founding trio of gangster films at the dawn of sound</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Little Caesar" was the first of the three movies that founded the gangster film as an art form during the age of sound. The other two were "The Public Enemy", released three months after Little Caesar, and 1932's "Scarface". The movie itself may only rate 8/10 stars, but it is Edward G. Robinson's performance that rates 10/10 stars.The film starts out with a distance shot of a gas station robbery in which the attendant is gunned down. You see the lights in the station go out, you hear the shots, you see the getaway car speed away. You can guess the rest. Such a scene would have not been nearly as powerful before the advent of sound and helps establish the ruthless nature of Rico. Later, Rico (Edward G. Robinson) and his partner Joe Massara (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.) are talking in a diner. Rico has designs on heading to the big city and getting in with a gang there. His partner is only interested in this life from the financial security angle, since he actually wants to go straight. Rico, though, believes in the gangster's version of the American dream and wants to climb to the top of the gangland power structure.Although "the big city" is never named, it seems to be Chicago from the various neighborhoods mentioned. Once there, Rico joins up with Sam Vettori's gang. Joe, however, is more interested in being an exhibition dancer at a local night spot, although he "moonlights" as a gangster just for the extra money and perhaps out of the habit of doing Rico's bidding. At first Rico seems content to take orders from Sam, but he is just biding his time. Once he realizes that Sam is weak he takes over his gang. Rico quickly climbs through the ranks until he is at the top of the criminal heap. Rico is interested only in power and status. To Rico, the money is important mainly as a symbol of this status. Rico has only one "soft spot" - his fondness for Joe. When he can't bring himself to shoot Joe to keep him from talking, Rico finds himself on the run and his fall is precipitous. His violent end comes when his overblown pride won't allow him to leave a local police chief's bragging to the newspapers about Rico's downfall to go unanswered. Ironically, and somewhat too coincidental to be believable, Rico is gunned down behind a sign advertising one of Joe's upcoming performances.Strangely enough, there isn't even that much direct violence in this film and absolutely no mention of prohibition. "Little Caesar" would probably not be so well remembered if it was not for Edward G. Robinson's star-making performance. Dialogue had not yet reached a very sophisticated level at this point in talking pictures, yet Robinson artfully portrays a ruthless gangster for which power and status are everything through his gestures and expressions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"There's a rope around my neck right now, and they only hang you once"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even four years after 'The Jazz Singer (1927),' Hollywood was still adapting to the "talkies." Mervyn LeRoy's 'Little Caesar (1931)' ? along with 'The Public Enemy (1931)' and 'Scarface (1932)' ? was one of the pivotal films in the development of the gangster genre {popular in the 1930s, and later a considerable influence on film noir}, but it also suffers the pitfalls of many early sound films. This rocky transition between mediums is still seen in the film's occasional use of explanatory intertitles, a vestigial remnant from the silent era. However, despite exhibited the drawbacks of its contemporaries ? limited use of sound, unremarkable visuals ? LeRoy's film could never have succeeded as a silent film, for the bulk of its power stems from the remarkable performance of a young-ish Edward G. Robinson. Though seemingly unintimidating as a short, plump petty criminal, Little Caesar has a nasty scowl, and a cocky drawl that shows that he means business. This might be the earliest case (that I've come across) of an actor using words to create a truly memorable character.'Little Caesar' is about a man who, tired of being a nobody, strikes out for the top. Less sinful characters in cinema have used this premise as a springboard for success in noble political, sporting, and artistic endeavours, but not Rico (Robinson) ? he's a small-time crook, and his dream is to be the biggest crook in town. Rico's ascent to power, probably modelled on the real-life rise of Al Capone, has served as a template for countless subsequent gangster films, including 'The Godfather: Part II (1974),' 'Scarface (1983)' and 'American Gangster (2007)' {indeed, "Little Caesar" novelist W.R. Burnett also worked on Howard Hawks' 'Scarface (1932)'}. As Little Caesar, Robinson completely dominates the film, and fortunately we rarely stray from his footsteps. Douglas Fairbanks Jr., as a reformed criminal-turned-dancer, does adequately in an uninteresting role. Thomas Jackson, as Sergeant Flaherty, invents a offbeat, ignoble sort of law-enforcer, speaking with a sarcastic, contemptuous whine that suggest utter disdain for his quarry.Many of W.R. Burnett's films involve characters who are ultimately brought down by their all-too-human weaknesses: Tony Camonte in 'Scarface (1932)' is brought down by his (incestuous) jealousy over his sister; Raven in 'This Gun for Hire (1942)' is too proud to abandon his planned assassinations; the heist thieves in 'The Asphalt Jungle (1950)' each have their respective vices. Likewise, Rico is toppled by a moment of compassion towards an old friend. Alcohol and women ? the two most popular pitfalls ? hold no regard to Little Caesar, who dismisses both as mere distractions from his power. But what I found most interesting is that, unlike the other examples I just mentioned, Rico is brought down by his only lingering morsel of virtue. This helps breed a sliver of audience sympathy towards a man who had formerly exhibited little but contempt for humanity, converting Rico's rise to power into a fully-fledged tragedy; of a man who wanted it all, but ? to his disbelief ? couldn't quite wrap his fingers around it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mother Of Mercy, Does This Suck!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:Yes, though this be relegated to the back, who gives a crap? Philosophers tell the truth, this is an example of it. Like Hawk's Scarface, which DePalma admitted he thought was a piece of crap, this movie had candles put around it and now it is blasphemy to whisper the truth: It sucks! Please, apply the best test of a bomb: Are there scenes that are supposed to be serious that are funny and vice versa? If you answer yes, to more than one scene, you have a movie that has been canonized beyond its actual value. My favorite is in the diner, at the very beginning, Rico's partner says he wants to go back to dancing. Rico looks disgustedly at him,"Dancing? Women? I don't have time for that, I'm gonna be somebody, see?" Here is a tip for gangster movies: people under four feet tall shouldn't play them, it renders the delineation unintentionally comic. If you read about this movie, you will discover that painter Robinson had to put tape on his eyelids because he kept making funny faces when he fired his weapon, which is about the same size as he is. Fairbank's scenes are painful, who talks like this? The cadence sounds like his undershorts are too tight, stop already. "Well, boys, I forgot to wish you a Merry Christmas," every syllable is over-enunciated and the movie is filled with dreadful anti-Italian racist stereotypes. Good Heavens, I was raised by Italians, my aunt and mom really didn't walk about in old world clothing like they just got off the boat from Torino, please!!Robinson did make some great movies like Scarlet Street but this overrated turd-ball was not one of them. Please, be honest, if everyone didn't tell you this was a classic, like Scarface, would you really like it? He overacts badly, if I hear, "you're getting weak, you're getting so you can dish it out but you can't take it no more," one more time, hand me a Thomson, please. He must use the adjective 'yellow' more times than a urologist. In fairness, this was an early talkie and the dialog is awkward and stilted, like Public Enemy, but look how superior that movie was and it was concomitant with this one. He looks like most of the other men could have picked him up and thrown him out the window like a javelin: the world's smallest bad-ass. When I showed this to a room full of guys, there was laughter and chuckling all through the movie. It is oddly symmetrical, Fairbanks is as bad a cop as Robinson is a tough guy. Who refers to the boss as 'the Big Boy', come on? Of course, he only eats spaghetti, you know, we Italians only eat that. Like The Sopranos, it is filled with WASP racism towards Irish and Italian people. The shooting of the crime commissioner is painful, he never even makes a reaching motion for a piece. Robinson blasts him after about a minute when it was clear he wasn't doing anything. We have some kind of union hall gift ceremony that belonged in Hoffa, apparently, this is how the clueless screenplay writers think gangster's sachems are like, Teamster Meetings, no, not really. Masseria and Maranzano really did not hold get-togethers that look like union hall watch giving crap. This is the main criticism, besides the bad acting, casting and directing. The people who wrote this know nothing about Organized Crime and it shows. Please, read Gangbusters by Volkman or other works on the Mafia. What is tragic about American Cinema, is that certain movies are worshiped by the older generation. When I read these reviews, the best are from young people who are coming into this with their eyes wide open, free of predilections to break out the hymnal. My favorites, on these pages, are from young people utterly confused why this is held up as a classic. You are right, my friends, it is not, but nobody dares say the emperor has no clothes. Please, it sucked when it was made over eighty years ago, guess what? It still sucks. Q.E.D.

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** First of the great 1930's gangster movies that set the standers for the hundreds that followed it over the next 70 years. Basically a rag to riches,if that's the word for it, story about a local hood Cesar Enrico "Rico" Bandello, Edward G. Robinson, making it to the top of a big city crime syndicate only to fall from power and back into oblivion, and eventual death. All this more because of his own arrogance and stupidity then that of the police and D.A's office.Starting out in life as a petty hood and stickup man Rico decided to make it big by becoming a member of the Sam Vellori, Stanley Field, Mob as a combination muscle &amp; hit-man. Making waves in the crime world by his brutal actions in getting the job done Rico is given the honor to rip off the Bronze Peacock nightclub on New Years Eve run by Vellori's biggest mob rival Little Arnie Lorch, Maurice Black. Rico get's his former partner in crime and now song and dance man at the club Joe Massara, Douglas Fairbanks Jr,to reluctantly get him and his hoods into the place to rob it. Inside things go terribly wrong when it turns out that the state Crime Commissioner Alvin McClure, Lenders Stevens, was there ,with friends, and gets shot and killed by Rico during the robbery. With Vellori panicking over the fallout of Commissioner McClure's murder Rico is anything but shy about his action and ruthlessness takes over Vellori's Mob knowing that the only person who can finger him in is the one person in the world he can trust with his life and freedom his best friend Joe Massara. Going for the "Big Boy's", Sidney Blackman, job as the top mobster in town Rico quickly consolidates his power and is about to make his move only to have his best friend, Joe Massara, stymie his grandiose master plan. Joe being the only person Rico can trust is a bit hesitant to join him as his second in command of his criminal organization and that drives Rico almost out of his bird. Having become an entertainer and becoming romantically involved with his dancing partner Olga Stassoff, Glenda Farrell, has made Joe soft in the head weak in the stomach and unwilling to leave Olga for a life of crime, with Rico &amp; friends. Rico coming to Joe's place with his fellow hood Otero, George E. Stone, to talk some sense into Joe and get him to leave Olga for him and his crime syndicate. This all leads to a wild shooting, by Otero, that leaves Joe wounded and Olga, who got the eye-witness account from Joe, later spilling the beans to the police about Rico being responsible for Commissioner McClure murder. It was interesting to see that Joe wouldn't implicate his friend Rico in the McClure murder and at the same time Rico didn't have the nerve to shoot Joe when he had the chance to. This showed that the two were still very close with each other even though they went, a while ago, their own separate ways. On the run from the police Otero ends up getting shot and killed but Rico escapes laving him the most wanted man in America. Being on the lamb and living in a skid row flop house Rico is goaded into coming out into the open by his nemesis in the movie "Little Caesar" Police Sgt. Flaherty, Thomas E. Jackson. feeling insulted by Flahertys remarks Rico stupidly, like Flaherty hoped, calls his office threatening to get even with him for putting down the "Big Man". Having Rico's pay phone traced has the police rush over to the flop house within minutes with Rico checking out from his .15 a night bed before they could put the cuffs on him. Trapped with nowhere to go or hide in an alley Rico shoots it out with the perusing police and gets plugged with a hail of lead falling dead in the streets. It's then when Rico utters his famous last words "Mother of Mercy, Is This The End Of Rico?". P.S Cesar Enrico Bandello was shot and killed behind a giant poster of his best friend Joe Massara and his dancing partner Olga Strassoff advertising their latest song and dance act at the Grand Thetaer "Tipsy Topsy Turvy".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robinson's Performance Highlights A Good Production That Still Works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edward G. Robinson's memorable performance in "Little Caesar" is rightfully one of his best-remembered roles. While he deserves also to be remembered for his versatility in many other performances as well, it's easy to see why this one in particular is still remembered. Along with James Cagney's role in "The Public Enemy", Robinson's portrayal here helped to exemplify the kinds of characters that for some time defined the genre.The story is not without interest in itself, as it follows the rise and decline of various gangsters and their followers. The fragile nature of their form of 'power' comes across quite clearly, and of course there is plenty of action as well. It's not especially subtle, but it wasn't supposed to be. The supporting cast all give solid performances, but Robinson's character is always the center of attention. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. has the most interesting character to work with among the supporting roles.The story moves at a good pace, especially given its release date, and is over almost before you know it. Even aside from Robinson, it's one of the better features of the earliest years of sound movies, handling the dialogue and sound better than most. Like "The Public Enemy", it was set in its own time, but it's a good production overall that still works rather well decades later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that made Edward G. Robinson's career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't the best film Robinson ever made, but from a historical point of view, it is THE film to see considering it made him a well-known and A-level actor. This is pretty much what also happened with Jimmy Cagney's THE PUBLIC ENEMY--which also came out the same year. Both films are "pre-Code" in style, as they show a higher level of violence than gangster films of the late 30s--though both pale in sleaziness and violence to Paul Muni's SCARFACE!The film begins with friends Robinson and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. as small-time hoods. They both decide they've had enough of this life so they move to "the big city" (though WHICH one is never said in the film). Robinson wants to move up and eventually control organized crime, while Fairbanks wants to be, believe it or not, a professional dancer! Both become very successful, but their lives are also inextricably intertwined. Exactly what occurs and how it all ends is really something you should see for yourself. It's an excellent ganger film--much better than average. However of the three gangster films I mentioned, my personal favorite would have to be THE PUBLIC ENEMY, as it's acting isn't quite as "over-the-top" and features a little more action and excitement.FYI--For an interesting error, watch Robinson's arm when he is shot towards the end of the film. Despite clearly being shot in the right arm, later the left arm is in a sling! I assume this was just a mistake and wasn't done as an inside joke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic gangster film that set a template for the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Little Caesar, the 1931 gangster film is something of a crime cinema classic. Name any gangster movie from the later years and you are bound to find something that was inspired by it, for in its short running time of a mere seventy four minutes, Little Caesar established several clichés that would stick with the genre for decades.After all, everyone is familiar with the 1970s version of Scarface which sees a penniless hoodlum rise from the gutter to become a major underworld crime figure due to ruthless ambition and sheer arrogance, but Little Caesar (and to an extent the original version of Scarface) did it first. Edward G. Robinson as the titular character is brilliant, his macho swaggering and grizzled features making him the very antithesis of the clean cut, square jawed Hollywood heroes of the era. Like Al Pacino would do decades later, he is the perfect anti-hero.It isn't just Scarface where you can see Little Caesar's influence however. As Rico (the character's actual name) is a squat but incredibly hard-nosed and violent gangster with a seriously aggressive temper, it is easy to see where Joe Pesci got so much inspiration for his role as Tommy Devito in Goodfellas.If there is a complaint that can be levelled at Little Caesar it is that it is too predictable, you can trace Rico's career even before it has begun but it must be considered that the clichés it employs were not clichés when it was made. It may be something of a one man show for the charismatic Robinson, but it encapsulates the genre at its very best in a gripping hour and twenty minutes and is very useful for understanding where just about every other gangster movie pinched most of their ideas from.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Caesar's rise and fall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caesar Enrico Bandello, better known as Rico, was a product of America's slums of the first part of the twentieth century. A lot of youths went to make names for themselves in crime. Existing conditions made the basically new generations of Americans of the immigrant class go into the areas their hard working parents would not have dreamed of. In part, being connected gave these aimless individuals a role in life and a style they could never achieve doing what their parents did.Rico, a man without scruples, and his good friend, Joe Massara, begin as small time hoodlums. Rico, joins the gang of a man involved in extortion. "Little Caesar" as he is known, decides to prove he can do what is expected of him by showing he is not afraid to deliver. His good friend Joe, takes a different path when he is hired to perform with the beautiful Olga, a night club act. When Rico kills Alvin McClure, a police commissioner, during a New Year's Eve celebration, he makes a name for himself, but he also attracts the attention of Flaherty, who is determined to get him. Rico sees opportunities in which to get Sam Vettori out of the way to become the most powerful man. His bold approach gains him the notoriety he was looking for with the unexpected amounts of money his criminal activities gave him. Unfortunately, like with other men involved in this type of life, his luck begins turning as the police closes on him. Joe, on the other hand, goes in the opposite direction from his friend. Rico's empire comes crashing down and has to pay dearly for his sins.Mervyn Leroy, the director of "Little Caesar", was responsible for creating a genre that started it all. Working on the adaptation of novel by W.R. Burnett, he gave the American public a portrait of the way the criminal element behaved. The way he conceived the Rico character comes clearly in the film. This man had no redeeming qualities. He was ruthless and egotistical. Power was Rico's drug of choice. The casting of Edward G. Robinson as Rico was crucial for the success of the film. Mr. Robinson, who made a career playing a lot of the strong men on the other side of the law gave the performance of his lifetime for the director. The sequence where Rico realizes all is lost, and the close up of face registering what his life has turned out to be, has to be one of the best examples of acting in a motion picture.Douglas Fairbanks Jr. has nothing to do. His character is too bland, perhaps to make Rico a stronger man. Glenda Farrell's Olga is only seen briefly. The other supporting members of the cast, notably, William Collier, Sidney Blackmer, Thomas Jackson, and the rest, contribute to our enjoyment in watching the film.Mervyn Leroy and Edward G. Robinson made a great contribution in a film that stands as a rare achievement in movie history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first in a long, amazing line of Warner crime films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Little Caesar (1931)In many ways, this is where it started, and it gets judged against the better Warner gangster films that followed (including some truly amazing movies with Cagney or Muni). So if you want the original Scarface or want to find the later great one, White Heat, you'll have to understand that Mervyn LeRoy set the standards for the genre here. And Edward G. Robinson sets up the idea of the ambitious and ruthless mobster, part class act, part egomaniac.Not that this is at all a bad film. It's pretty wonderful at times, and clips along steadily, with a little too much talk. The filming is good, and the range of bit parts gives it all a convincing air. Most of all is Edward G. Robinson's presence as Little Caesar himself, making his buddy, played by Douglas Fairbanks Jr., look like the amateur he sort of was. The common roles we expect in later gangster movies aren't fully here yet--the woman on the side, the priest giving guidance--but other aspects really are, including a mother for one gangster to return to, the ruthless detective, and the shifting hierarchy of thugs.This is actually where the action lies, this rivalry between gangster gangs and even within them. It's great stuff, the opening door for a decade and more of great crime movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He came, he saw, he conked out...!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhat dated but still watchable early gangster classic which announced the considerable talent of Edward G Robinson to the big-time in Hollywood. And no wonder - he easily out-acts everyone else here starting from a small-time hoodlum, his stature in the film grows exponentially with his ambition so that at his zenith, he no longer seems so "little" and dominates the film frames. One great scene where Rico advances threateningly on Fairbanks only to retreat when he realises he can't shoot his childhood pal, amply demonstrates this point. Robinson's acting contrasts with some old-fashioned mannered acting of the remainder of the cast, particularly the detached drollery of his nemesis on the police force who eventually guns Rico down thus extracting one of Hollywood's most famous dying lines. There are some interesting undercurrents at work, principally a possible homo - erotic streak in Rico, evidenced by his misogynistic outburst at his early buddy and cohort, Fairbanks Jr. when the latter goes straight, for the love of a good woman, as the cliché has it and even more so in the strange scene where Rico preens at himself in the mirror, all tuxed up, in front of his new too-adoring sidekick. Supposedly based on the rise of Al Capone, the movie would have worked better if there had been more blurring of the edges around the lawmen, particularly as Capone had most of the Chicago police in his pocket (the film obviously made some years before the real - life Elliot Ness created his "untouchables"). Although it plays less well than many of the gangster greats that followed it, "Little Caesar" is important in introducing the gangster genre to 30's Hollywood and with it the talents of Cagney, Bogart and Raft to name but three. Nevertheless, Robinson stands comparison with any of them and there's ample evidence why right here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Little Caesar" opens with a diner scene (spaghetti and coffee?) in which Caesar Enrico Bandello (Edward G. Robinson) and Joey Massara (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.) wonder what it would be like in the "Big Town". Small town hoods, Enrico fantasizes about making a splash as a big time mobster, while pal Joey wants to put the criminal life behind him and become a dancer.Rico's first break comes when he convinces the Palermo Club gang leader Sam Vettori to take him in. The group includes characters with colorful names like Killer Pepe, Kid Bean and Scabby. Early on, Rico is hot tempered and quick with the trigger finger, and Sam needs to reign him in when a no nonsense boss like Diamond Pete Montana (Ralph Ince) comes to town.Rico cannot be controlled however, and crosses the line when he shoots and kills Crime Commissioner McClure at a New Year's Eve Party. Now a man to be reckoned with and seeing an opening, Rico makes his move on Sam Vettori. But one wonders why a man like Vettori simply rolls over and allows Rico to take over; Vettori's own men don't back him in the power play. Even more unconvincing, Vettori remains loyal to Rico as they trade places, honoring him at a testimonial dinner. Rico's next target is rival gang leader Little Arnie Lorch, owner of a gambling house and the next rung on Rico's ladder - "If you ain't out of town by tomorrow morning, you won't never leave except in a pine box". Impressed by Rico's ambition, city boss "Big Boy" (Sidney Blackmer) offers him full control of the city's North Side, replacing Diamond Pete Montana. By this time, you know that Rico's lust for power won't end there, and that his ambition will eventually focus on Big Boy himself.All the while, long time pal Joey uncomfortably maintains his friendship with Rico, attempting to find his break in dancing and show business. He falls in love with show girl Olga Strassoff (Glenda Farrell), and the relationship causes a strain between him and Rico. Wanting her out of the picture, Rico forces a confrontation between himself and the lovers, and for the first time he backs down when Joey challenges him to shoot.As the law closes in on Rico, his fortune suddenly reverses drastically. On the run, he winds up in a flophouse, appearing tired, dirty and pathetic, taunted by a newspaper account that essentially describes him as yellow. In a tirade, Rico phones his nemesis Sergeant Tom Flaherty. Fittingly, Rico meets his end under a billboard featuring Joey Massara and Olga Strassoff - the title - "Tipsy Topsy Turvy" - just what Rico's world had become.As one of the earliest gangster films, "Little Caesar" set a tone for the genre and led to other successful movies, most notably James Cagney's "Public Enemy". It's acting though seems over the top and forced at times, and as mentioned earlier, one should watch with a critical eye for plot holes. Rico is never realistically challenged in his rise to the top of the mob world; contrast that with both the subtle and conspicuous rivalries in a more modern film like "Godfather". And wouldn't a mob boss living in luxury have a car to make his getaway from the police? Finally, it doesn't seem fitting that a man with Rico's sense of self importance and grandeur would allow himself to descend into the squalor of a ghetto flophouse; surely he had enough money to maintain some dignity in exile if necessary.All of this aside, "Little Caesar" merits viewing for it's impact on early film making and the creation of the criminal/gangster genre. It established Edward G. Robinson as a rising star, and if nothing else, created some of the better remembered and repeated clichés to remain till this day - "The bigger they come, the harder they fall".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Powerful portrait of the rise and fall of a nasty mobster extraordinarily performed by Edward G Robinson . A heinous and villain hoodlum named Rico (Edward G. Robinson) moves from the country to the big town and joins Sam Vettori's gang along with his fellow Joe Massara (Clark Gable was originally considered for the part but Jack L. Warner decided that Gable's ears were too big, and the role went to Douglas Fairbanks Jr. instead) to rise up through the ranks of the city underworld . Soon he becomes the boss of the mobsters and known as Little Caesar, and gets closer to the great gangster Pete Montana (Ralph Ince) and Big Boy (Sidney Blackmer) . The character of Cesare Enrico Bandello is not, as widely believed, based on Al Capone. Instead, he is based on Salvatore "Sam" Cardinella, a violent Chicago gangster who operated in the early years of Prohibition . And the role of Joe Massara was based on actor George Raft, who was associated with Owney Madden, the man who organized the taxi racket in New York City. The movie results to be one of the great mobsters pictures , and an expertly directed film that made Edward G Robinson a superstar . Despite the film's huge success, the book's author, W.R. Burnett, was furious that no actual Italians were cast in the film . Classic gangster movie contains top-notch performances , intense drama , thrills , fast-paced , action , and a shocking final . Magnificent Edward G Robinson in the title role as a snarling and ominous gangster . In one scene, Edward G. Robinson had to fire a pistol while facing the camera , try as he might, he was unable to keep his eyes open each time he pulled the trigger . Producer Hal B. Wallis originally auditioned Edward G. Robinson for the supporting role of Otero -played in the film by George Stone- before deciding he was perfect as Rico . Although The Doorway to Hell(1930), a gangster film released by Warner Bros. in 1930 was a big hit at the time, most sources consider Little Caesar to be the film which started a brief craze for the genre in the early 1930s. The "Forward" that now appears on the beginning of the film was added for the 1954 re-release of Little Caesar and The public enemy (1931) as a combination package.The character Diamond Pete Montana was modeled on Jim Colosimo, who was murdered by Al Capone; and "The Big Boy" was based on corrupt politician William 'Big Bill' Thompson, Mayor of Chicago. The underworld banquet sequence was also based on a real event - a notorious party in honor of two gangsters, Charles Dion O'Bannion and Samuel J. "Nails" Morton, which received unfavorable coverage in the Chicago press. This First National Vitaphone early talking picture was well directed by Mervyn LeRoy and ready for release in December 1930, but Warner's brass felt it was not a Christmas picture , it officially debuted at the Strand Theatre in New York City on 9 January 1931. It ranked #9 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre "Gangster" in June 2008.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its Reputation Blurs the Fact That It's a Mediocre Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edward G. Robinson plays the OTHER iconic gangster in that OTHER iconic gangster film from 1931, "Little Caesar." But Mervyn LeRoy's film, though released before "The Public Enemy" by about four months, feels like a less remarkable rip off. It has none of the visual audaciousness of William Wellman's film, and there are no images to remember. It's pretty static and by the numbers film making.Robinson deserves credit, though, for creating a completely different kind of gangster from Cagney. His Rico is actually a bit of a born loser. He's an ugly little bulldog of a guy who wants the status of the criminal elite but isn't comfortable in that world once he gets it. Most critics seem to think that the film wouldn't be anything without Robinson's performance--that's true, though I don't think it's all that much even with it.Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. plays Rico's best friend, providing the film with a much-discussed homosexual undertone. I have to agree with the professor who provided commentary on the DVD release--whether Rico's crisis extends from repressed homosexual feelings for his buddy, or whether it's a more general rejection of humanity, is pretty much irrelevant, because either interpretation brings the film to the same conclusion.Glenda Farrell gets the thankless gangster moll honors here.Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fascinating 1930 early talkie with Warner Bros astonishing gramophone sound system: Vitaphone. For any student of early sound films (are there any left?) Little Caesar is the original recipe for mob gangster movies of the modern era. It is not full of clichés because like 42nd STREET did for musicals, it invented the scenes and plot points and behavior some persons so cleverly belatedly label 'cliches'. In the early 30s these films were astonishing new state of the art technology.. all wood, wires and magnets and as a contraption it all worked... in fact so well, that 3500 seat movie palaces were constructed to house them and their eager customers. Today in 200 seat featureless curtained boxes at the multiplex with zillion volt DVD sound we are fed Adam Sandler and Hostel and we are supposed to believe we have progressed. Like most films of the early 30s we are able to stick our head through a portal and incredibly, actually time travel to see and hear and even almost experience another time and age, recorded for the very first time in per-fect hear-mo-ny. Thanks to Vitaphone. Yippee. See WHOOPEE and FRANKENSTEIN for equal 1930 sound on film (photophone) type thrills.</fullReview>

Rico is as tough as Tom Power (Cagney) in "The Public Enemy", but probably more criminal than Power. The plot of "Little Caesar" is similar to "The Public Enemy". Rico wanted to be powerful and famous, all his life was for that, and he got it for a while but not for long. In that world of mafia, the bosses are replaced quickly and everything moves according to the interests of different groups. Rico did not understand that, and this was his failure, he considered himself a kind of Zar, untouchable, he really was it but lasted for a while. Technically the copy of this film seems to be much better than the one of "The Public Enemy" (1931). "Little Caesar" is a jewel of Robinson's acting and perhaps his first success in his cinema career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mnyeah! I ain't doin' s'bad -- so far!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this movie for the first time, you may get the feeling that you've seen it all before. The reason for this is that you have. All the iconography of the gangster film is presented here for the first time. It would appear in later films of the genre, even unto "The Godfather" and beyond. That's more than sixty years of being hit over the head with the immigrant who rises out of the gutter before toppling like a ship's mast destepped. The fierce bark of pistols. The insults and contempt of the honest policeman. The squad cars roaring out of the underground garage of the police station. The first tuxedo. The solemnity of the flower-bedecked funeral. The assassination attempt and the revenge. The quarrels over "territory." The disruptive blond. The banquet honoring the protagonist's apotheosis. The sirens growing in the background at the crime scene. The traitorous snitch. The stuttering chopper. And the dialog! So filled with single entendres. "Ya can dish it out but ya got so's ya can't take it no more." "Some day you and I are gonna take a little walk, Rico." "Whatsamatter with you? Ya yellow?" "Nice to see all you gents with your molls." "My gun's gonna speak it's piece." "Screw, mug." And the immortal, "Mother of Mercy, is this the end of Rico?" I won't bother to describe it in any detail. If you're familiar with "Little Caesar" you already know the story, and if you haven't -- you still know the story.However, I'd like to direct your attention to a scene that always has me in stitches. It's after Rico has lost his lofty position. He winds up in a flophouse, boozing out of the bottle. In the foreground are a couple of bums reading aloud from a newspaper about Rico's rise and fall. Edward G. Robinson, as Rico, is lying on his bed listening intently. He's disheveled, filthy, drunk, and greasy with sweat. When the bums read about his rise to power he snarls and bares his teeth in a smile, nodding savagely. When the bums read about Rico's being yellow and taking a powder, Robinson goes absolutely ape with rage, growling and spitting, carrying on like some animal in a zoo no more than a few feet from the bums -- and they pay him no attention whatever.This was one of three gangster films that came out at about the same time and established the conventions of the genre. The others were "Scarface" and "Public Enemy." All three carried the same armature -- the immigrant kid rising to power and being shot down. But, curiously, two of them had paraphilic undertones. "Scarface" had a healthy dose of incest. And "Little Caesar" came about as close to an on-screen portrayal of homosexual jealousy as you could get in 1931. Robinson is, after all, unable to coax its gun into speaking its piece when he tries to kill his buddy, nor does Robinson seem to stimulate the glands of Molls. (There's an execrable anatomical pun in there somewhere.)That Edward G. Robinson went on to a long and fairly distinguished career in the movies is something of a surprise. His acting here is so stylized and his appearance so unprepossessing that it would have been perfectly understandable if he'd given this one outstanding performance and then disappeared in a puff of smoke. Instead, he played leads and character parts for the next forty or fifty years, almost always giving good performances, sometime fine performances.I don't know if this observation belongs here or on the message boards, but we notice several times that Caesar's ambitions are perfectly normal as far as his goals are concerned: power, respect, and money. ("Ahh, money's okay but it ain't everything.") Caesar's problem is with the means he chooses to achieve these goals. They happen to be illegal, whereas Joe's, for instance, are not. The sociologist Robert Merton suggested that you could (1) accept both the means and the goals of society, which makes you a conformist; (2) you could accept the goals but reject the means like Caesar, which makes you an innovator; (3) you could accept the means but reject the goals, which makes you what Merton called a "ritualist," the kind of mousy bureaucrat who keeps his head down and plays CYA. There is a fourth cell in the typology. (4) You could reject both society's goals and the means to achieve them. In that case, you're a lunatic or a revolutionary. I wanted to add this because it's an interesting and unusual way of looking at the difference between Caesar and Joe. Thank you for your indulgence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scene Chewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was my first time seeing Robinson on film. He's fantastic. I'll watch anything with him in it. He's intense, fluidly expressive, carries a film with ease and chews scenery like no-one else I've EVER seen!The movie itself was, in my opinion, an interesting study in power, in the idea that power depends not only on intimidation, but also on love and loyalty; and that leadership is part inspiration, party intimidation and part entertainment.Also interesting: Little Caesar has two parts. There is a prologue which takes place in a diner in the form of a conversation between Robinson and his crony, Douglas Fairbanks Junior, which really is a short film in itself, a beautiful short film in fact - a perfect little film. One really doesn't need to watch the rest of the movie, which basically reprises the themes of the prologue, throws in lots of Robinson scenery chewing and features production values not up to the quality of the acting and writing (unlike the prologue, which is perfectly set and filmed and where Fairbank's more restrained acting plays off Robinson perfectly).All in all, quite an outing at the (home) theater!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The rise and fall of a gangster.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a well made and entertaining early gangster movie about the rise and fall of an ambitious criminal played by Edward G. Robinson.OK so this movie may not be "The Godfather" or "Scarface" but its a good gangster movie on its own nevertheless. The movie has a solid story even though the storytelling itself is lacking at times. The movie often takes jumps in the time-line and some moments feel rather hasted. But this is sort of fitting for '30's cinema standards.It's a movie that is mostly carried by its characters and actors rather than its events. The movie has many characters in it, which does make the movie seem well constructed and written. Most of the actors go extremely over-the-top in their roles, it's perhaps the only reason why the movie does feel quite dated. The only one who seems to play his character in the right way was Edward G. Robinson. He really was superb. He also went over-the-top but in a good and positive fitting way for its character and story. He carried the movie mostly on his own and makes the movie worth seeing for his performance alone. Douglas Fairbanks Jr. also plays a good role but his role is limited down a bit too much to really leave a lasting impression.The movie features most of the typical gangster clichés. The movie is filled with a whole bunch of tough backstabbing wise-guys, who each want to profit from another and go up the criminal ladder. The movie follows one of those characters. It provides a good and entertaining look into the organized crime of the 20's/30's, during the infamous prohibition. The movie has some good and typical violent gangster moments, complete with shootouts and tough talking and looking gangsters.It all in all makes the movie a really good early gangster movie that obviously inspired many other later genre movies. For that reason alone it's already a bit of a must-see.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warner Bros. Finds Its' Niche</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1931, Warner Brothers gave birth to a new genre, and in doing so secured it's place among the top Hollywood studios. The releases of "The Public Enemy" and "Little Caesar" gave rise to the gangster movie, which has proved, over the years to be one of the more powerful, successful types of film to be produced.These films also gave us two new "MovieStars". James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson. Both of these men went on to have long careers and succeeded in many different kinds of roles. But it is the gangster film for which they will forever be linked."Little Caesar" is the story of a Chicago hood who is not afraid to seize control from his criminal boss, and fight against the law to get his way, and rise to the top of the mob. It is also the story of a friendship that lasts even during times of adversity, and when seemingly, two friends' lives go in opposite directions.Obviously, since the film was released in 1931, it has many of the pitfalls that other films of the time suffer from. Unbelievable plot developments, over-acting secondary characters and shootings that do not produce any blood or torn clothing.But we accept and sometimes embrace these shortcomings, because: 1. We accept that film making was in it's infancy, and 2. Because as long as the premise, story, and characters are interesting, nothing else matters."Little Caesar" isn't a classic because it was a great movie. It's a classic because it was the first of it's kind, with a very good story and a break-through performance by Edward G. Robinson7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Occupational hazards of being a gangster...Robinson's tough guy snarls his way to stardom...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the obvious drawbacks of being an early talking film with a mostly silent background for the soundtrack (except for the bullets) and some snappy dialog ('30s style), LITTLE CAESAR holds the attention like a magnet because of EDWARD G. ROBINSON's tough guy persona as he snarls his way up the rungs of the gangster ladder. And snarl he does with most of his terse dialog, "yeah!"Most of it is played in the sort of acting style common to films of this period, but it still fascinates and demands attention with a plot line outlining the rise and fall of a ruthless and arrogant gangster who looks somewhat like Al Capone. Robinson vividly gets across his character with a snarl in his voice that seems a little melodramatic after awhile (almost a parody of a gangster) but suits the style of this lurid underworld melodrama directed with style by Mervyn LeRoy.DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS, JR. (before his trademark mustache), is a sleek and debonair presence, offering a handsome contrast to Robinson's rather homely mug. Any inference of a homosexual relationship between the two is strictly in the mind of certain viewers and certainly not implied by the script. Robinson's inability to shoot Fairbanks because he "likes" him is all we need know.GLENDA FARRELL, before her tough girl image was fashioned, is rather ordinary as "the girl" loved by Fairbanks. The standout in the supporting cast is Thomas E. Jackson as Flaherty, the police officer who has some humorously sardonic lines. His sarcastic quips offer a truthful commentary on the proceedings.Enjoyable as an early gangster film, but limited in quality by the primitive sound recording. It certainly benefits from Anton Grot's interesting sets and the stark B&amp;W photography of Tony Gaudio. Well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...Is this the end of Rico?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Little Caesar" is generally accepted as the movie that began the Warner Bros. gangster films of the 1930s and turned star Edward G. Robinson into a major star. Although a bit dated, it still holds up 75 years after its initial release.Rico (Robinson) and his pal Joe Massara (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.) are a couple of small time hoods. Rico has big ambitions. They move to the big city where Rico joins the mob headed by night club owner Sam Vetton (Stanley Fields) while Joe hooks up with Olgs Strassoff (Glenda Farrell) and forms a dancing act in a rival night club. Rico becomes known as Little Caesar as he manipulates his way to the top. He takes over Sam's mob and has designs on other mobs, wanting to be the top guy.We watch Rico's meteoric rise through the ranks until it all begins to unravel.Robinson chews up the scenery as Rico, so much so that he became identified with the part for the rest of his long career. I'm not sure, but I don't think he played another gangster until his similar Johnny Rocco in "Key Largo" (1948). He did play in many other gangster movies in the 30s but mostly as a crusading crime fighter. Fairbanks, who was only in his early 20s at the time seems miscast as the good bad guy. It is mentioned in the DVD commentary that Clark Gable had been up for the role (probably a better choice) but producer Jack Warner and director Mervyn Leroy thought that Gable would never make it in movies because of his big ears. Hmm,,,he who laughs last.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Little Caesar' is the first in a run of gangster films made by Warner Brothers in the 1930's. It made Robinson a star and established a new genre.Robinson is 'Little Caesar', a gangster with Napoleonic ambition (and stature)and brutality. He quickly rises to the top in the East, but his stronghold on organized crime is threatened by equally ambitious rival criminals, his friend Joe's doubts, and the cops who want to nail him.Robinson gives a terrific performance as Rico. It is unfortunate that the rest of the film does not hold up so well as Robinson's performance does. Fairbanks is miscast in his role and looks uncomfortable in most of his scenes. The love angle between Joe and Olga (Glenda Farrell) gets tiresome quickly, with Farrell displaying all the personality of a lump of wood placed in front of a camera.The moralizing also becomes tiresome, as the only character displaying a hint of charisma is, you bet, Rico- Little Caesar himself.It is an early talkie with some severe dialogue problems. Actually, no, the dialogue itself is fine (Robinson spits out quite a few choice lines), it's the delivery that is the problem. These characters are meant to be tough gangsters, right? Well, with their letter-perfect diction and rounded vowels they sound like New England college boys. Films at this point were still hell-bent on showing off the new toy (sound) in all it's glory, so the adjustment of speech for the character and sound for the situation was ignored. Long passages of dialogue seem to drag on needlessly throughout this film- shoot it out boys, don't just talk it out! There are some terrific sequences here- most memorable is Rico's death scene ('Mother of Mercy...Is the end of Rico?) LeRoy also makes good use of lighting and shadows in an Expressionistic mode.Not the best in the gangster cycle by any means, yet still very important. Watch it for Robinson and the history behind it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay More than just a little bit....Early sound pictures could be pretty ugly at times-the actors not quite sure what they're supposed to do, directors allowing them to chew the scenery or get away w/ absolutely Awful wooden performances, depending on who you had. Here 'Sam Vittorio' or whatever is pretty bad, for example, but certainly Edward G is tops.It's usually compared to 'Public Enemy', and while I think that one holds up better, certainly this one has it's good points. Robinson was terrific(if such a cartoony performance that everyone aped him ala Shatner or Brando later on)George E Stone, Glenda Farrell and the Crone at the end all affective, along w/ the mood and pure sombre air. It's not a pretty picture LeRoy paints of Little Caesar's rise.I enjoyed the sardonic cop too, quite funny.One flaw, well--just exactly What happened to all of Rico's money, how did he wind up being broke and at the mercy of the haggy lady at the end? That just didn't seem to jibe w/ his pseudo-Capone like level of 'Mugsy-dom', you know? Surely he would have had $$ stashed around the city, safe-houses, guards, cars, etc at his disposal. I didn't quite buy that.Overall, see it for what it is, landmark film-making that creaks and shows it's age at times, but holds up pretty okay still.*** outta ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horribly unimpressive and unoriginal gangster film. It's amazing that this movie is often put in the same class as William Wellman's Public Enemy. Like all gangster pics of the time, they both cover the rise and fall of some criminal tough guy. Aside from that, however, the two films could not be more opposite. Wellman's picture was a gritty, artistic masterpiece, while this clunker is nothing more than a stock gangster film with barely a good quality to speak of. The writing is horrible, the acting is worse, and it seems like director Mervyn LeRoy wasn't even trying. It's hard to hate iconic star, Edward G. Robinson, as the title character, even if he does overact his way through every scene. It's easy to hate everything else, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Little Caesar is probably the critically least highly regarded of the trio of films,--Scarface and The Public Enemy being the other two--that kicked off the gangster cycle of the early thirties. I don't know why. The script is sharp, to the point, and hasn't an ounce of fat, and Mervyn LeRoy's direction is energetic and at times highly imaginative. The movie is best-remembered today for the dynamic, no holds barred performance of Edward G. Robinson in the title role of Rico, the little gutter rat who climbs his way to the top of Chicago's mobdom.Rico scarcely has a personal life. Even women don't seem to interest him. His one true friend, Joe Masara, played by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., is a good deal younger than Rico, and a lot better looking. The script hints at a homosexual attachment on Rico's part, but this is never fully developed. What he really lusts for is power. Since we are never told anything of Rico's earlier life his power hunger seems unmotivated,--the one major flaw of the film--but there's so much to appreciate in this tidy little classic there's really no cause for complaint.</fullReview>

Not to mention the fact that the chief piece of anti-organized crime legislation was named after the lead character of this film... it has sealed its place in history.I will say that time has not necessarily been good to the picture. The sound is poor at times, the video fuzzy, and it really needs a better restoration than the DVD that Warner Brothers produced. Also, it has moments that may have been good for 1930s viewers, but come across as unintentionally funny now.</fullReview>

I'm not keeping track of the Italian references in these, the other one, Scarface, is 10 times more unpleasant and awful, and perhaps even more removed from its cultural reference. Universal had their three monster designs, Frankenstein, Dracula and the Mummy. Warner Brothers had two gangster designs, The Public Enemy and Little Caesar. Every film mentioned here features a spectacular lead actor star performance. There's nothing nostalgic about the film-making. Little Caesar reflected the current events of the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robinson is dynamic!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film along with "The Public Enemy" started the gangster cycle. "The Public Enemy" was concerned with a young thug (James Cagney) and his rise up the ranks. It's story was mainly about prohibition and Tom Powers alienation from his family (especially his older brother Mike.)"Little Caesar" is about organised crime. The absence of a music score adds to the gritty realism. Edward G. Robinson gives a dynamic performance. He is not wholly evil - at the end he cannot kill Joe. He is a cold blooded killer - but has a "little kid in a candy store" gullibility about him. He is suitably impressed by the trappings of wealth (the paintings and furnishings of his gangland boss, "Big Boy" (Sidney Blackmer) - when told that the painting cost $15,000 Rico remarks "boy, picture frames sure cost a lot nowadays!!". His commemorative dinner where he is given a diamond and platinum watch - later he finds it has been stolen from the chief of police. Towards the end of the film when he is in need of money, he finds that the old crone (Lucille La Verne, looking and sounding like the Wicked Witch from "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs") that he has left his money with will not give it to him - so he is left penniless. Another interesting point is that it is only after he hits rock bottom that he starts to drink - before that he only drank milk.From the first scene in the diner Rico Bandello feels life holds big things for him. He tells Joe Massara (Douglas Fairbanks Jnr., in a role that was modeled on George Raft, or so I read) that he wants to quit this burg and try his luck in the East."Shoot first - ask questions later" that's Rico's motto. Joe wants to go back to his old profession of dancing and he does at the "Club Palmero" where he meets Olga, (Glenda Farrell) his partner who believes in him. There is to be a robbery at Joe's club - he has to be a decoy - there is to be no shooting. Rico gets trigger happy and shoots the crime commissioner. Tony crashes the car while disposing of it and runs away. "If anyone is going to turn yellow my gun is going to speak it's peace" says Rico.By the films end Rico is hiding out on skid row but a taunting editorial by Flaherty forces Rico out in the open. He is shot behind the billboard advertising Joe and Olga's new show "Tipsy, Topsy, Turvey".Thomas E. Jackson, who seems to have been typecast throughout his career as a policeman, has a great part as Flaherty, the laconic and sarcastic policeman. He is a master of dry wit. William Collier Jnr. plays the luckless Tony, who is shot on the church steps by Rico. George E. Stone is Otero, Rico's right hand man. Maurice Black, who seemed very busy in films in the early 30s, has the small part of Little Arnie Lorch, the owner of the dance club.I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Odyssey Review #049: Little Caesar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>049: Little Caesar (1931) - released 1/9/1931; viewed 5/11/06.President Hoover goes before Congress and asks for ideas for a $150 million public works project. Gandhi leaves for Britain for negotiations. Thomas Edison submits his last patent application.BIRTHS: Robert Duvall.DOUG: As we come off one unbearably slow year of films (10 movies in 9 weeks), we open up what will hopefully be a much quicker and more immersing year with Little Caesar. With this, we see the beginning of the gangster film, a genre that flourished greatly with sound thanks to gunshots, screams, and sneering villains like Edward G. Robinson. It was a lot of fun to take in one of the original entries of the genre, mostly thanks to Robinson's performance. If you look up "gangster movie" in the movie dictionary, you will see a picture of Edward G. Robinson (I have). Having seen The Public Enemy and Scarface, it seems that the plot of most gangster films, even the best ones, are essentially the same: A gangster starts out at the bottom, wheels and deals and shoots his way to the top, and then violently comes back down, where he dies horribly. Such are the days of genre pictures in the Golden Age of Cinema. What is interesting about this and other gangster films is that at the time, not only was this genre new, but it was extremely current; with the Depression and the Prohibition, guys like Al Capone and Sam Cardinella were at the top of their game (the St. Valentine's Day Massacre had occurred just two years before).KEVIN: We open 1931 with the seminal gangster classic Little Caesar. I loved this movie. I didn't think it would hold up so well as it's probably the most imitated gangster film ever made. I noticed that in terms of the cinematography, this film doesn't have as much contrast. It uses a lot more grays than previous films we've watched here. Maybe that's just the excellent restoration. The story was obviously unique for the time, as it's credited with popularizing the anti-hero. We can't help but root for Rico (Edward G. Robinson) as he climbs the criminal underworld, only to suffer an equally meteoric plummet. I love the moment when he takes over Vettori's gang just by telling him he's taking over and Vettori (Stanley Fields) can only agree with him. We also try to root for Rico's good-natured friend Joe (played by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.) but it's hard for him to compete with Robinson. One of the more interesting performances in the film was Thomas Jackson as Sergeant Flaherty. The way he turns up the slime factor when he deals with these mob bosses, he could just as easily be one of them. My favorite scene in the movie is towards the end, after Rico's had his fall from grace, he listens to some guys reading the paper with an article about him full of insults. The shot holds on a tight close up of Robinson's drunken face as he slowly but surely takes the bait.Last film viewed: Soup to Nuts (1930). Last film chronologically: The Criminal Code (1930). Next film: Cimarron (1931).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie that started Warner's gangster-cycle has dated a lot since it came out over seventy years ago.The acting is perhaps a bit too hammy for modern tastes,but the performance of Edward G.Robinson still retains its power.Some of director LeRoy's storytelling devices may seem as cliche after being used in countless movies dealing with organized crime,but in the early thirties there had never been anything like it. It's fun to watch Thomas Jackson's laconic cop. Pretty good show after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great showcase for Robinson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film established the great Edward G. Robinson (né Emmanuel Goldberg) as one of the great gangsters of all time along with the sublime James Cagney and the immortal Humphrey Bogart. I cannot praise Mr. Robinson enough. My favorite role of his was the insurance investigator in Double Indemnity. His role as the jilted father (much like King Lear) in House of Strangers is also particularly strong. But Little Caesar is what first put him on the map. Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (né Ullman) is good in the little screen time he is given. Since the movie is only 80 minutes long, I think his role could've been expanded. The supporting roles were also nicely played. The reputation of this gangster classic is justified. It is a must for Robinson fans, 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget scarface, forget Goodfellas, this is the first and still the best gangster film ever made.Edward G Robinson floods the screen with his excellent presence. The little tough guy, the daring one, the one brave enough to step forward and move up in the gangster ranks.To me, this film is what the term gangster is all about. Drinking milk and being firm and tough. Since the dawn of scarface gangster films have been doing it all wrong. Little caesar is really the archetypal gangster movie. The 30's was the gangster era. The cars, the attire.The film follows little caesar as he gradually climbs the gangster ladder, all the way to the top. Duping his friends and taking control, being daring and rough.A grand film which barely seems dated. Don't say you've seen a GOOD gangster film until you've seen this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robinson bumps it a notch above mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Warner Bros' prototypical gangster flicks, released the same year as The Public Enemy that still stands out for Eddie G's bold and in-your-face turn as the vicious mug of the title. The film itself though shows and sounds its age more than most from the era and at times is a slow moving bore. This came very soon after the transfer to sound pictures and most of the actors show it, suffering from a languid, ponderous delivery that holds the picture up in several scenes but never seems to hamper Robinson.The short statured star bulls his way through the unassured cast just like his character bulls his way to the top of the criminal empire - determined, abrasive, cocksure, miserable and not to be denied. It really is an early tour de force for Robinson, eminently quotable and much imitated. Forever a cinematic icon.But it's far from a perfect picture. The structure is flimsy and Rico has no depth coming from the direction or script, just what Robinson gives him. Douglas Fairbanks Jr. will have probably written his performance off in this out of embarrassment by 1933, and ditto for Glenda Farrell who did much better work later on.The film's strengths are its visual style, at times very inventive, and Robinson's performance, culminating in his dying words stolen no doubt at gunpoint from Nero 'Is this the end of Rico?'A famous picture and worth seeing, but Cagney and Harlow in the Public Enemy is probably your best bet of the two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ambitious criminal Rico (Edward G. Robinson) moves from the country to the big city in the east and joins Sam Vettori's (Stanley Fields) gang with his friend Joe Massara (Douglas Fainbanks Jr.). Sooner he becomes the leader of the gangsters and known as Little Caesar, and gets closer to the great mobster Pete Montana (Ralph Ince). In a robbery of a night-club, he kills the Crime Commissioner Alvin McClure (Landers Stevens) and his pal Joe witnesses the murder. When Rico orders Joe to leave his mistress Olga Strassoff (Glenda Farrell), she takes a serious decision.Nobody can deny the historical importance of "Little Caesar", the movie shot in the American Great Depression that started the genre of movies of gangsters. However, the linear story in the present days is totally predictable and the performance of Edward G. Robinson is actually exaggerated and quite silly. I did not understand why Rico orders Joe to leave Olga, and I have already read some comments that give a homosexual connotation to his act, which sounds very reasonable. But the explanation based on the sexual preference, although explains many attitudes of Rico, is never clear in the story. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Alma no Lodo" ("Soul in the Mud")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historic film, but still a gangster film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think anyone who enjoys classic films has heard of this film. And, probably has seen the scene where Robinson says, "Is this the end of Rico?" But I had always avoided the film because I am no fan of gangster movies (or for that matter Hollywood's other obsession of the 1930s -- the lives of rich people). But, I also enjoy Edward G. Robinson, so I make occasional exceptions for his gangster films. My most basic conclusion is that while this is a very good gangster film, it's not a 4 star film, as TCM classes it.I always had the idea this was Edward G. Robinson's first film, which it's not. But it certainly was his breakthrough performance. I wouldn't quite class it as a truly great performance, but Robinson sure does strut his stuff.I won't praise any of the supporting actors because they seem very stereotypical, although the writers and director do develop some of the characters to a depth that was not typical in 1931 (particularly in regard to ethnicity).Warner Brothers obviously some money into this film. The sets are quite impressive.The question has come up many times regarding whether or not there are gay overtones to this film. It's subtle. Would I have noticed it without reading about it...perhaps not. But, once I was looking for it, it was obviously there.Better than the average gangster pic? Absolutely. Great acting by Robinson? Well, memorable, at least. It put Robinson on the map, so I'm grateful for that. Recommended for film history buffs and those who like gangster films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having been released in 1931, this movie has to be the first REAL on screen depiction of a gangster. Edward G. Robinson turned in a performance here that should definitely be seen by modern gangster movie fans. The way he dominates his competition and rises to the top is purely in his attitude and speech. He has a way of addressing people throughout the film that makes you cringe. You have no doubt about why they are intimidated. It's not mad like Pacino in "Scarface" or meek, like Brando in "The Godfather..." It's pushy, bold and cocky; something like Cagney in "White Heat." This is truly the predecessor of all gangster movies and, though a little predictable in plot, has a powerful story. Only problem is that it seems less powerful and more predictable now after having seen too many rip-offs.8 out of 10, kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The rise and fall of ambitious hoodlum Enrico Bardello is given classic interpretation by a snarling Edward G. Robinson in the first celluloid sound gangster bio Little Caeser. With vicious unbridled enthusiasm the ruthless and misogynistic Bardello spits bullets and threats as he claws his way to the top of criminal ladder. Nearly eighty years after he created the gangster archetype Edward G. Robinson's Caesar blueprint has been countlessly imitated in film, on stage and in casual conversation. Loosely based on the career of Al Capone film audiences in 31 had never seen outside of Universal horror films a monster of this type before. Audacious and unrepentant Robinson is vividly all bluster and ego without an ounce of sentimentality save his poorly masked homo erotic feelings toward sidekick Joe Massera ( Douglas Fairbanks Jr.) who wants out of the gang. Director Mervyn LeRoy does an economical job of blending action and posing mobsters in creating a vivid world of illicit gain and bloodshed. There's some wonderful tough talk inflection offered up by the good fellas( Ralph Ince, William Collier, George Stone) and cop nemesis Sgt. Flaherty (Tom Jackson) whose low key sarcasm elevates Rico's rage . Robinson's Caesar however holds center stage from start to finish. Whether being feted in a tux or bedraggled in an alley no mug ain't gonna take this picture away from him. See?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First True Classic of the 1930's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LITTLE CAESAR is the kind of classic you can watch a dozen times without having it grow stale. This film was "outdated" when it was re-released paired with Public Enemy circa 1950. Today it's newer and brighter than 60 years ago. From the opening scene with Edward G Robinson and Douglas Fairbanks Jr in the diner, before either gets involved in crime, this film grabs you and will keep you interested till the end.They knew how to make a picture in 1931 (but have obviously forgotten in 2007). A great movie doesn't take much money to make. Take a great performance like Robinson's and run with it, keep the story going, and get to the point in something under 90 minutes.Having endured in theaters for over 50 years through numerous reissues, until VHS videos made reissues obsolete, LITTLE CAESAR will continue on DVD, on cable, anywhere classic movies are shown. The New York Times gave it a mixed review in 1931; showing how little they know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where all the parodies came from</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Little Caesar" is over-the-top, silly, and even campy. That's what makes it so entertaining however. This folks is where all the parodies came from. The film is inevitably dated and clichéd, but this was the original, the one that all the other grade-b mob movies took from. Viewed today, its not as good as "The Public Enemy", but its still just as entertaining.You could complain that the film is plagued by problems typical of early sound features. Its obvious that many filmmakers and actors weren't used to the new medium. Therefor, there are some awkward moments of silence, unsure delivery, and a lack of a music score when it is sorely needed at moments. Some of the acting is wooden and silted. Not Edward G. Robinson however. He is gloriously over-the-top, delivering every line of his with much manic energy. I can see Pacino idolizing this guy, and with good reason. Its a fantastic and memorable performance. For him alone, this is a classic. "Little Caesar" is delightfully goofy and over-the-top and is certainly never boring. It has a place in film history also as being the first mob movie.An interesting side note is the alleged homosexual subtext. Whether this was intended or not, it certainly comes through in moments and is amusing. The relationship between Rico and Massara is what people often cite as the most obvious example. However, the character of Otero seems to be the most homoerotic in my opinion. A fascinating layer to the film to say the least. (7/10)</fullReview>

Set during the depression it tells the blood soaked story of Caesar 'Rico' Bandello and his ascendency from just another mug on the streets to a full fledged hoodlum.This is probably one of Robinson's most outstanding performances, and one would have to have been hiding under a rock to not know the expression 'Mother of mercy, is this the end of Rico?', a line worthy of being the *subject* of discussion. This movie is a wonderful example of film noir for those new comers to this wonderful era, or for fans.One thing that clearly stands out is the relationship between Rico and *JoeMassara*. The communication they have is particularly pertinent to the story. Without some of the exchanges between these two *Gangster MAILs* its unlikely the story would move along at the pace it does. The hardship of their relationship beautifully sums up the hard nosed gangster style of those days.This movie is a must see for all fans of film noir and true cinema.

The high drama of "The Godfather" isn't altogether missing-- gang takeovers, drive-by shootings, and other points of reference to mob activity are portrayed in realistic manner here, and it DOES draw you in. I think I might actually like this movie better than Godfather because the characters are more likeable, even if somewhat goofy.

		<shortDescription>Little Caesar, That's Who!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie that made Edward G. Robinson a star. He plays Rico, a small-time hoodlum who rises to power in the criminal underworld. Little Caesar is perhaps the most parodied of all the gangster films of the 1930's. Bugs Bunny cartoons especially had a field day with it. Whether it also was the inspiration for the naming of the pizza franchise I don't know. Robinson does a great job and he's backed up by a solid stable of supporting actors. Douglas Fairbanks is a little weak but not enough to drag the film down.The gangster drama is still around today, although much less prominently than its 1930's heyday. 1931 marked the beginning of a rich genre that would provide some of the best films of the 1930s and 40s. Little Caesar is part of the trinity of groundbreaking gangster films, along with The Public Enemy and Scarface. Most other gangster flicks would take their cues from these movies. Little Caesar is a strong, exciting film that's just fun to watch. It's one of those seminal films everybody should see at least once. Please check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hail Caesar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warner Brothers released a slew of gangster movies in the early 1930s, films like "The Public Enemy", "Little Caesar", "Scarface" and "White Heat" laying down the template for virtually every gangster picture that followed.Born in an age of urban poverty, overcrowding, and disease, these flicks immediately proved popular with audiences. More importantly, they were fairly cheap to produce, requiring relatively simple sets and small casts. And whilst the makers of modern gangster flicks routinely spend millions recreating period details and elaborate cityscapes, these early film-makers simply stuck a camera outside and filmed the naked streets. Indeed, some of the biggest pleasures of these early gangster films can be found in their simple establishing shots, which allow us to eavesdrop upon 1930s traffic jams, shops, pedestrians and cities. These establishing shots, banal capsules hanging free from their respective stories, offer a nice contrast to the more romanticised period details of modern gangster movies. Compare, for example, how nostalgic Leone and Coppola's street scenes feel in "Once Upon A Time In America" and "Godfather 2".What's most striking, though, is how little the gangster genre has changed over the years. Thematically the genre has charted no new territory. There's nothing in "Goodfellas", "Public Enemies", "Once Upon A Time In America" or "American Gangster", for instance, that you can't find in any of these early Warner Brothers features. The differences are only cosmetic: more swearing, more violence, more blood, faster editing, more nudity etc. Though the genre has evolved aesthetically, technology progressing and attitudes toward sex and violence relaxing, it still conforms to old narratives, content to reinforce the existing order of things.Juxtaposing modern gangster films with early WB machine gun operas, one is also immediately confronted with how superficial the typical "rise and fall" gangster narrative is; young kids or hoodlums join a gang, rise through the ranks, become powerful and then lose all their power or violently die. This has the double effect of both highlighting the infectious allure of criminality, whilst also pointing out that those who partake are ultimately doomed. A film like "Goodfellas" is itself peppered with nothing but scenes hijacked from these early films, albeit jazzed up with frenetic editing and countless rock and roll tunes. Indeed, the message of "Goodfellas" is itself the falsity of "Goodfellas"; a kind of postmodern renunciation of truth.But what's more interesting is the way all these gangster movies make a connection between the success of the criminal and the success of the businessman. This romanticism continued throughout the 60s and 70s, with gangster flicks like "Bonnie and Clyde" and "The Godfather Saga", all films in which the criminal becomes representative of a very capitalist ideal.The result is that, far from being stories about anti-establishment heroes bucking the system, gangster movies began to reveal themselves as being quaintly conformist. Rather than subversively undermining it, Hollywood's gangsters are in gleeful acceptance of the status quo, these films stressing that gangsters are no different from the corporate criminals whom they rob. Criminals, in other words, are merely engaging in an alternative method of business. Don Corleone, Henry Hill, Noodles, Tony Montana, Bonnie and Clyde, like any business, ultimately all want money. And why do they want money? Simply to better enjoy life.During this period, a few iconoclastic directors - Godard, Fassbinder, Kubrick, Altman - played against convention. Altman's "Thieves Like Us", for example, is explicitly about the dreary conformity of the gangster; like any ordinary homemaker, they simply want enough cash to refit their kitchens and pay off their mortgages. Also offbeat was Kubrick "Clockwork Orange", a film which never gets branded a gangster flick (it's hero was modelled after gangster regular James Cagney). Here, a criminal called Alex and his gang of droogs exist almost entirely outside of capitalist logic, committing crimes for no financial purpose. They rape, pillage and destroy, but have no desire to accumulate. Oddly, Alex's gang only falls apart when his droogs get greedy and desire to rob a woman purely for financial gain. They later become police officers.But such films are oddities. When "The Godfather" was released it forever cemented the romantic comparison between the gangster and the American businessman. In these films, organised crime is rendered as nothing more than another family business, subject to profit and loss, risk and calculation, promotion and firing. "Goodfellas" continues this point of view, but brings the business down to the blue-collar day-to-day workings of the organisation. Scorsese's gangsters are workers whilst Coppola's are the owners, but both viewpoints serve to covertly appeal to megalomania and power. Compare with Brian De Palma's brilliantly nutty "Scarface", which turns power and accumulation into something pathetic. There, all gangsters are castrated, impotent goofs, each bent on fulfilling what is really an unquenchable, existential Lack (be it with penises, money or machine guns). The crime movies of Altman and Fassbinder are even more subversive.Today, free from the Hays Code, modern day gangsters now also have the luxury of much happier endings. Directors are no longer obliged to tack on a "crime doesn't pay" ending, and so we have Brando dying gracefully of old age, DeNiro waxing nostalgic for the golden days and Henry Hill getting to live in the suburbs rather than die. These films are all brutally nostalgic, mourning the loss of a time when anti heroes regularly bucked the system, perhaps because we secretly want to ourselves.8/10 ? Each new corporate scandal further dissolves the lines of separation between criminals and big business, both groups, be they owners, middle management or lower level employees, ultimately in ruthless pursuit of the same thing: the acquisition of wealth and the accumulation of toys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The end of Rico that started it all ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1930, Prohibition was still depriving the lives of American citizens from one of their most beloved leisure: drinking. At the same time, Hollywood started to make talking movies, as to satisfy the thirst for a new kind of entertainment. While technology is more responsible for the talkies' success, is it really a coincidence that the most preeminent genre of the 30's was the gangster film, that the first sounds people would hear in theaters would be horns, screeching tires, firing machine guns, screaming women, and gunshots, or that the most memorable bits of dialogs would speak thought- provoking statements about American ideals? "Little Caesar" is a landmark that can't be analyzed outside its historical context: the climax of both the Prohibition and the criminal violence it generated. The Volstead Act was responsible for the rise of emblematic gangster figures such as Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky, and naturally: Al Capone, probably the only criminal to become a cultural icon, an ambiguity that is the very essence of the anti-heroic figure. And when you think of it, from Michael Corleone to Tony Montana, the most memorable movie gangsters have never been totally evil, amoral or spiritless. And all these underworld's icons owe something to Edward G. Robinson's performance as "Little Caesar", an Italian-American criminal who wants his share of the American Dream, and wants it badly. Little, as the title suggests, the character is remembered for his short stature and a "cat-fish mug" according to IMDb, while I perceive more more of a baby face, especially in the unforgettable close-up in the scene when he confronts his friend, Joe Massara, played by Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Anyway, as ingrate as his appearance is, Little Caesar embodies the syndrome of another famous emperor, Napoleon, the little guy who wants to conquer the world, which makes his Italian background more significantIndeed, whether Italian in Coppola and Scorsese's epic crime films, Cuban in "Scarface" or Jewish in "Once Upon a Time in America", there has always been a strong dichotomy implied between the growth of a new demographic category: young, male, eager to grow and to live the American dream and the subsequent rise of criminal activities. Little Caesar totally embodies the most pervert side of the American Dream, as if the status of emigrants was a sordid alibi for their ruthless ambition, as if America was a virgin land waiting for newcomers to make up for their lost years, when the WASP took all the legal areas, well, quoting Tony Montana's anatomical metaphor about Miami would be eloquent enough.And as a foreigner, Little Caesar knew all the tricks of the American Dream and lived his life as if he was trapped in a jungle and moved by a sort of survival instinct where the fittest is the one who gets bigger than the enemy and kills him. Maybe "Little Caesar" reveals the Darwinian impulses of criminal, surviving in an environment that maintains the 'good' citizens in a state of slavery while only the outlaws can free themselves, by being strong, tough and not undergo the unfair decisions from the Law, starting from the Prohibition itself. Rico's defying attitude is the driver of his status as a hero from the wrong side, hence his place as one of the first cinematic antiheroes.And we take him seriously because he doesn't enjoy himself; he's never gratuitously sadistic or violent. Forget about women and booze, cigar is his only weakness. And since cinema is more an art of imagery than ideas, the cigar became a synonym of toughness, leadership and Alpha-male charisma, which is also at the same time the very symbol of the capitalistic figure. The power of Robinson's performance is to supposedly base a performance on a figure like Al Capone, with whom he share similar facial features, yet still carry some respectability of its own, and become a landmark in terms of influential performances, only equaled by James Cagney in "The Public Enemy", who plays a totally different character.There's even more to say about Robinson's performance which is more three-dimensional than most of today's criminal portrayals, his attitude towards his friend's romance betrayed a more ambiguous personality, slightly hinted by the interactions with his effeminate sidekick. But what the 'seemingly' homosexual undertones show is a man so diluted in his own ego he wouldn't let himself distracted by a relationship, a man who tries so much to play it tough that he can't hide the fact that he can become as soft as his enemies were, and it's the film's pivotal moments of the film, when he realizes he can't kill his friend, to which the sidekick retorts by calling him "soft": the Emperor started slipping. Like Tony Montana in "Scarface", Little Caesar's weakness is his heart and his demise is as immediate as his rise was swift. And as a man who succeeded by the ego, he'd perish by it, by calling him a coward, the Irish Detective Flaherty brought him back from the slums to the spotlights, for the ultimate confrontation. And I'm sure that for the first time, viewers rooted for the villain and not just because the better actor played him. Through the unforgettable "Mother of mercy, is this the end of Rico?", we can feel that Rico had such a high opinion of himself, he couldn't even believe he would die, and that's what his eyes betray: disbelief. That's what most gangsters are: big egos, we admire first and feel sorry for at the end. And the end of Rico coincided with the birth of the antihero, and if by many aspects, the film has dated a little bit, some parts are grainier than others, and many performances, including the histrionic cop leave a lot to desire, there's no doubt that "Little Caesar" carried by a bravura performance from Edward G. Robinson, planted the first seeds of the gangster film ? see?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Small-town gangster Edward G. Robinson (as Enrico "Rico" Bandello) and attractive companion Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (as Joe Massara) leave east for the "Big Town" where Mr. Robinson wants to move up in the criminal world. To Robinson's chagrin, Mr. Fairbanks wants to go straight. Fairbanks gets a job dancing at "The Bronze Peacock" and gets romantic with beautiful blonde Glenda Farrell (as Olga Stassoff). Robinson becomes a successful mob chief, but finds it difficult to keep Fairbanks in the fold.The New Testament verse Matthew 26:52, wherein Jesus says, "for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword," may open the film with a dead giveaway. "Little Caesar" is a creaky classic, with Robinson and director Mervyn LeRoy working hard. The sound of violence made it a box office hit. This film made Robinson a big star; although, he was obviously going to be one in any case. The access Robinson gives George E. Stone (as Otero) to his boss' bed and waistline should raise more than a few eyebrows.******* Little Caesar (1/9/31) Mervyn LeRoy ~ Edward G.

		<fullReview>Rico Bandello quickly rises thru the gangster ranks, earning himself the nick-name of Little Caesar. As he sets his sights on the top boss job held by Pete Montana, Rico knows the heat is closing in, fast.Tho not the first gangster picture to hit the big screen, Little Caesar is undeniably one of the genres landmark pictures. Adapted from W.R. Burnett's {High Sierra} Al Capone inspired novel, Little Caesar would go on to influence many of the genre highlights that followed this piece. While in the process typecasting its star and icon, Edward G. Robinson. What is perhaps the first striking thing about viewing the film now is actually just how un-violent it is in context to what would follow it, but it never needs to be because this is not just about a violent rising. With the advent of sound proving to be a winner with depression jaded cinema goers, director Mervyn LeRoy exploits this by utilising the fact that it's set outside of prison walls. The gangster genre by and large up to this point in 1931 consisted of mob characters behind bars, the sight of Rico about town amongst the noisy hustle and bustle surely would have opened the eyes and ears of the paying public.I wasn't around back then so have no on the spot frame of reference, but the professional critics point to many allegories that reside within Little Caesar's structure. Talk of paranoia's and conformity's during economic collapse, which are for sure points of reference for those so inclined to analyse and dissect Caesar as a whole. But to me it's a gangster picture first and foremost, outlaying the rise and fall of a very dubious man with big ideals above his relatively small social standing. Rico has ruthless violence constantly itching to burst out, and definite hints of sexual ambiguity make him a worrying, yet most intriguing character. That it works so well obviously is down to Edward G. Robinson's portrayal, big bulging eyes and snappy slang phrases {this themselves must have really hit a chord with the viewers}, Robinson gives the performance that so many have imitated over the years, probably defining the archetype in the process.It does look a little dated now, but that is surely only natural?, but it's a powerful film that rises above merely being a hoodlum piece. Producer Darryl Zanuck wanted something different for this burgeoning genre, and with the might of Warners revelling in the power of the talkie movie, they all crafted one hell of a picture that enthrals as much as it has influenced, things most definitely changed with Little Caesar. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps when Chaplin avoided stepping into the talking picture era, this is one of the movies he was thinking of. An example of a good cast and story being overwhelmed by technical limitations. It's more like a filmed play than a cinematic movie, but the actors aren't projecting to the audience or even to each other. They always seem to be addressing a hidden microphone. The film's one real asset is introducing the gangster genre and Edward G. Robinson to a large audience. ** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very offensive, moronic, flawed, and with outdated notions.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edward G. Robinson, under five-and-one-half feet tall, plays a tough guy who talks rough and is always reaching for his heater. He likes to kill people and even guns down the good guy Irish police commissioner in front of many witnesses. Little Caesar even takes over the mob. Possessing little intellect, he can barely form words into sentences at a gangster convention. Ludicrous! Not one actor who played a gang member in the motion picture was a real Italian. But the actors who did surely gained and lost their flawed accents throughout the movie. At least Robinson did not try to use an accent. And the Italian women - why they are not morally high either. To continue the director's purpose of degrading an entire group of people, they are made to wear clothing from the late nineteenth century! Even Little Caesar's last days and ending do not ring true. The diminutive Robinson was Jewish, but fattened up by playing Italian gangsters with a relish (without any redeeming characteristics whatsoever) throughout the thirties and forties. The movie directors included folks like Lewis Milestone and Mervyn LeRoy, and today, Sidney Lumet. A problem is that Robinson does not have the guise; he looks like a Jewish fellow acting as an Italian. The whole stereotypical genre got its offensive beginning in "The Racket" (1928) with Louis Wolheim, and continued with "Scarface, the Shame of a Nation" (Paul Muni, 1932), Robinson again and again and culminating in "Key Largo" (1948), Lee J. Cobb in "Party Girl" (1958), and Harold J. Stone in Mitchell (1975). Note that even Caucasians who played the oriental role of Charlie Chan were good guys who exuded nothing but patience, intellect, and virtue. But not these other folks, no sir! For those characters were always one-dimensional. No wonder Italian-Americans are ticked off. But we have come a long way in the 21st century as Italians played the now defunct Sopranos. Oh goodie! What a tired cliché!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kindergarten Cinema, A Victim of Its Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nobody can deny the historical importance of Little Caesar, Mervyn LeRoy's miniature bioepic shot during the Great Depression that initiated the wonderful gangster genre. Nevertheless, the story in the present day is completely unsurprising and banally familiar, the bare bones of what has been given flesh, blood and life force in many years since.Edward G. Robinson, though not nearly at the top of his form, still knocks and kicks his way through the insecure cast, including Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., just as his character Rico steps on heads and cuts throats to reach the top of the unlawful kingdom, gritty, aggressive, enormously narcissistic, miserly and tyrannical. It may not quite be the early tour de force for Robinson that many say it is because the film on the whole is ultimately forgettable, but he paints a clear-cut picture of his quotable and much imitated character. Little Caesar's construction is insubstantial and Rico has no depth coming from the writing or LeRoy, just what Robinson accentuates.Little Caesar is unfortunately really a victim of its time. What satisfied audiences in 1931 changed so rapidly that even in the 1940s, this film would have been just as dull.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original Big Shot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just less than a year before Cagney's "Public Enemy" and a decade before Cagney made his own version of a similar story with "The Roaring Twenties", Edward G. Robinson played the bootleg King of Chicago, a fictional version of Al Capone. Slithering up the ladder of the mob and quickly taking over, his decline was just as rapid with enemies made not only of the cops but other mobsters as well. This Chicago version of Napoleon is a little guy who bullies everybody along the way, so it is obvious as to why his own mob soldiers will grow to hate him.Slow-moving and even a little creaky, it explodes every time that Robinson is on screen, but slows down to a snail's pace when Douglas Fairbanks Jr. comes on as his protégé. It is also memorable for a cameo by veteran actress Lucille La Verne who made ugliness an art form with her hag like characterization in two epics concerning the French Revolution: the silent "Orphans of the Storm" and the original (and best) "A Tale of Two Cities". She is best known for the face of the crone in Disney's "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" which she also provided the voice for. A close-up of her profile is totally unforgettable.Robinson went on to many similar roles (even spoofing this character many years later in "Robin and the Seven Hoods"), and the saga of his rise to fame and fortune shows the ego-building so fast that you know it will be so much fun to watch his downfall.</fullReview>

Robinson), a small-time criminal who moves to the city, along with his buddy Joe Massara (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.). There they join Sam Vettori's gang. After Rico guns down the police commissioner during a robbery, his reputation grows, and he rises in the ranks, creating a monstrous ego. But with the rise of power and fortune comes betrayal, deceit, and the inevitable demise.After the wall street crash of 1929, it was inescapable that the gangster film would become a huge box-office success. After all, these were men that took what they wanted, and lived in luxurious homes, and adorned with expensive jewellery. But with the glamorisation of crime, comes the moral paradox - and even here, in a film almost eighty years old, the message that a representation of good and evil is never that clear, and the concept is filled with grey areas. In the great depression, people instinctively mistrusted authority. After all, they were as corrupt as the gangsters that paid them.With an electrifying performance by Robinson, he spits the snappy dialogue out as if he "were" the charismatic street criminal. He sneers at the camera, and is utterly magnetic. As Rico's relationship with Joe splinters, - Joe begins a love affair with the delectable Olga Stassoff (Glenda Farrel) - it soon turns nasty. But, soon the reality of the situation catches up to Rico, and, probable to a Hollywood movie, morality becomes its climax. Essential early talkie genre cinema. "Yeah! sho get-it watched.

Decades before the supposedly "ground-breaking" flick BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, the same plot pervades LITTLE CAESAR for all to see, if they care to really look. If you subtract this meaty gray subtext from LITTLE CAESAR's scant 78-minute running time, is there even anything worth noting left? One might argue that the remaining coherent thread tying parts of this tawdry tale together is its vehement pro-Prohibition message. Crime czar Alvin McClure seems hell-bent upon a night of illegal drinking himself at the Bronze Peacock when he's gunned down (perhaps because his ale-addled reaction time is no match for then Tea-Totaller Enrico's). So what's the first thing "call-me-Rico; R-I-C-O" does when he finally lets himself fall under the influence of Demon Rum? He rings up his chief persecutor, Flaherty, of course, and "LITTLE CAESAR" is soon history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As things started to settle down after the sound revolution, new kinds of picture and new kinds of star began to emerge. One thing that producers and directors quickly realised was that in the talkies a performer's voice could be just as much an asset as anything else they had to offer. This was particularly true in the gangster genre, which boomed in the early 30s, and relied on wisecracks just as much as it did on gunshots.Like James Cagney, a gangster star who would appear on the scene a few months later in The Public Enemy, Edward G. Robinson has a distinctive and characteristic voice. He was unlikely to have made it as a major player had he come along in the silent era, but he took the talkies by storm, thanks to his sharpness in delivering snappy dialogue (of which there is plenty in Little Caesar, thanks to ace screenwriter Francis Faragoh), which encouraged the audience to look past his squat build and beady eyes, and be enthralled by his commanding presence. Robinson is quite a joy to watch, a whirl of eye-catching gestures, pointing with a cigar or jabbing with his thumb. And yet he can also show an emotional depth and make the most of quieter moments, especially towards the end of the picture. Little Caesar, his debut in a lead role, remains one of his most captivating performances.In the director's chair is Mervyn LeRoy. LeRoy had a knack of spotting potential stars and putting them in the limelight, and this is more or less literally what he does with Robinson. He doesn't give the actor an especially grand entrance, but allows him to gradually impress himself upon the audience as his character rises to power. Take the scene where Rico first meets Arnie Lorch. Everything is shot fairly formally, and Robinson isn't even that prominent. Then Lorch demands to know who this guy is, and why he's here. Rico snaps back "You ain't giving me orders!" for which Leroy shoots at a new angle, with Robinson staring straight into the lens. It's a great little moment, and it represents Rico's true entrance. LeRoy's tack is to give Robinson the opportunity, through framing and foregrounding, to become a force within the scene, something which Robinson lives up to superbly. Like his subject matter, LeRoy's style is sassy and fast-moving. He often opens a scene with an attention-grabbing close-up or odd angle, such as the downward shot of Lorch's roulette wheel. He was still a young director here and he sometimes overdoes things, but he would learn subtlety in his subsequent features.Of course pictures like this, along with The Public Enemy, Scarface and the like, ostensibly set out to denounce the gangster way of life. I say ostensibly, because that is not how they came across, and producers knew this as much as audiences. Edward Robinson's Rico may not be good looking, but he has charisma by the bucket load, and whether or not we approve of what he does it is him we route for. By contrast, the cop played by Thomas E. Jackson is a slimy, unpleasant character, and very definitely the villain of the piece. And yes, Little Caesar may open with a biblical quote denouncing violence, but in a picture like this it is the images ? and that sharp and searing dialogue ? that speak the loudest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All Hail "Little Caesar", Edward G. Robinson's ticket to the bigtime. Eddie doesn't miss an acting trick in a stellar performance as Rico, a ruthless small town punk with big city dreams. There an element of homoeroticism with Rico, such as his curt dismissal of "Dames, dancing. What'll that get ya?" to his erstwhile pal Joe. Another such incident occurs when Rico is getting dressed up in a tuxedo to go to the "Big Boy's" house. Rico is lying on his bed with Otero at the foot of the bed. As the scene fades out, Otero can be seen moving closer to the smiling Rico. But primarily "Little Caesar" offers up one of the best of the early gangster film - plenty of action keeps the plot rolling right along. Rico moves from gas station stickup punk to gang member and finally gang chief and even underboss of the crime syndicate. Of course, 1930's sensibilities brought Rico down at the ironic ending</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First National must have spent all of ten bucks on the production. The sets are spare, the "streets" ghostly, while the gloom hangs heavy. Looks like the main expense was the nightclub scene that really comes alive with crowds and lighting. Good thing there's Robinson, otherwise the film would be thoroughly forgettable. As the snarling Rico, he delivers tough guy in spades, while climbing the ladder of criminal success. Actually, the violence totals much less than you might expect. Mostly it's gangsters dropping in on each other to size up the competition.Okay, the biggest reviewer issue seems to be whether Rico is gay or not. Mark me down in the affirmative. As others point out, there're simply too many hints to ignore. Besides it makes his tough guy all the more interesting, especially when he would jeopardize his criminal empire by making the decidedly non-tough Joe (Fairbanks) his "trusted" companion.Anyway, the movie creaks with age, has a ton of sometimes silly dialog, plus too much wooden acting (e.g. Fairbanks), but still showcases a central performance that remains a classic of its kind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Little Caesar is a good example of a film that is historically important but which has dated very poorly. The camera work, by cinematographer Tony Gaudio, is mediocre, the spare soundtrack, by Erno Rapee, is garbled, and the acting very wooden. Even Edward G. Robinson, who became a star in this role, is merely OK. What makes this all the more amazing is that, just a few months later, in 1931, Jimmy Cagney would burst on to the screen with The Public Enemy, a film that holds up cinematically- technically and aesthetically- far better. Directed by Mervyn LeRoy, and written by Francis Edward Faragoh and Robert N. Lee, adapted from a novel by W.R. Burnett, the 78 minute, black and white film, limps along, despite being nominated for a Best Adapted Screenplay Academy Award. So unsure of its narrative power is the film that, like its silent era cousins, it makes extensive use of intertitle cards to convey plot points quickly, and also obscure the narrative fact of its indeterminate chronology.That's because there is a general awkwardness to this film that many early talky pictures had, and the acting style is unconvincing. There are scenes which simply make little sense, diegetically or not, and clank along in stereotypes. Aside form The Public Enemy, and the Paul Muni vehicle, Scarface: The Shame Of A Nation, one might also compare it to German Director Fritz Lang's film M, released the same year, which made a star of Peter Lorre, another rather un-movie star-like movie star. In that film, Lorre plays a pedophile child killer done in by a trial brought by local gangsters, enraged that his killings have brought the wrath of the cops down upon them. That film, like The Public Enemy, is far more realistic in its depictions of crime, criminals, and their motivations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had seen many clips of this film, and I knew it was a classic gangster movie, it was great to know that it was the first ever to have spoken dialogue, and I was definitely going to see it because it was in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, from director Mervyn LeRoy (Mister Roberts). Basically Caesar Enrico 'Rico' Bandello (Edward G. Robinson) and his friend Joe Massara (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.) are small-time criminals who are seeking their fortunes in Chicago, and while Rico, also nicknamed Little Caesar, joins Sam Vettori (Stanley Fields) and his gang Joe is more interested in becoming a professional dancer, and he gains a partner and girlfriend with Olga Stassoff (Glenda Farrell). Joe tries to get away from the gangster lifestyle and any involvement in their schemes, but he is made to participate in the robbery of the nightclub he works in, along with Rico who was given orders from underworld overlord 'Big Boy' (Sidney Blackmer) not to open fire and create bloodshed, but he kills Crime Commissioner Alvin McClure (Landers Stevens), his shocked friend witnessed it. Gang leader Sam is accused by Rico of being soft, and he is allowed to take control over the crime ring, and with this happening an assassination attempt on him is organised by rival boss 'Little Arnie' Storch (Maurice Black), but it fails and he is only grazed, so they visit him and his gunmen, after the men quickly leave for Detroit, and Rico gains control of Chicago's Northside as well. With Joe gaining a good reputation as a dancer and hardly seeing his former friend, and he is visited by the now gang lord who is concerned he knows a lot, he is told to forget about Olga and return to the life of crime, and he is threatened if he does not accept, he refuses anyway, and following this Olga calls Police Sergeant Flaherty (Thomas E. Jackson) so he can talk. Rico and his henchman Otero (George E. Stone) shortly after the call come round, Rico aims his gun to kill Joe before he can spill about the crime activities, but he cannot bring himself to pull the trigger, and when Otero tries to kill him Rico wrestles to take his gun, and in the scuffle Joe is wounded with a gunshot, this is heard by Flaherty who chases and kill Otero running out. Joe provides the information to the police and Flaherty is determined to bring down Little Caesar and his empire, and knowing that he is a wanted man Rico disappears to a life on the streets, and sometime later he sees the news that he is branded a coward, enraged he foolishly calls the cops to announce he is coming back, and the call is traced, Rico tries to escape but is gunned down and killed behind a billboard by Flaherty, and ironically it has an advertisement poster featuring Olga and Joe. Also starring William Collier Jr. as Tony Passa, Ralph Ince as Diamond Pete Montana and Armand Kaliz as De Voss. Robinson gives a fantastic leading performance, he may not look like the typical kind of character that will climb in the crime world to become the kingpin, but he proves a sly and ruthless criminal and steals every scene, the other cast members such as Fairbanks Jr. and Farrell are good as well. The story is pretty easy to follow, a lowlife crook slowly becomes the most wanted man in the city, based on the real life mobster Al Capone, there is a great script with witty dialogue, and many memorable moments with guns shooting and criminal schemes, and of course the final catchphrase, this is absolutely a must see classic crime drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Adaptation. Caesar Enrico Bandello was number 38 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains, and "Mother of mercy, is this the end of Rico?" was number 73 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Edward G. Robinson may not have been a real pretty boy or large in stature but he made up for that in a big way by having a memorable mug and a very large presence on screen. When he's talking, you want to listen. Here he takes a juicy part and runs with it, in this prime example of tough and gritty Warner Bros. crime melodramas. Robinson plays Caesar Enrico Bandello - otherwise known as "Rico" - a small time thug who lusts for the power that befits the crime kingpins of the city. He works his way into the mob by offering his services to mobster Sam Vettori (Stanley Fields). Soon, his influence is growing stronger and stronger until Vettoris' underlings are taking orders from him instead of their original boss. He rises to a high enough position that he becomes a popular figure in the media, and comes to enjoy all the trappings of his status. Naturally, after such a rise there must inevitably come a fall, as Rico finds things eventually unravelling; his main Achilles heel is his affection for childhood friend Joe Massara (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.), even though he comes to consider Joe a personal liability. Joe has his own problem: he doesn't really want the thug life, and tries to leave it behind and follow his true passion of being a dancer. Director Mervyn LeRoy keeps the action moving right along; one key robbery / murder set piece is particularly well edited. The cinematography is moody and stylish, and the story, based on a novel by W.R. Burnett (and inspired by a real-life Chicago gangster named Salvatore "Sam" Cardinella), is overall familiar but fundamentally well told. The supporting cast also includes feisty Glenda Farrell as Olga, Joes' love interest, William Collier Jr. as regretful mob flunky Tony, who has a change of heart and tries to go straight, Sidney Blackmer, Ralph Ince, and Maurice Black as various mafiosi, and the highly amusing Thomas E. Jackson as Ricos' police detective nemesis. Clocking in at a trim 79 minutes, "Little Caesar" is often credited, along with "The Public Enemy", as successfully kick starting the crime drama craze of the 1930s, and holds up well today as a very solid and believable little film that remains riveting throughout, all the way to its resolution with a stunned Rico wondering how things could have ended up the way they did. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The rise and fall of Little Caesar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Little Caesar is an archetypal gangster film from the early 1930s, a early example and it offered a breakout performance for Edward G. Robinson whom distinctive voice has been copied for Chief Wiggam in The Simpsons.Rico (Robinson) and his friend Joe Massara (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.) are two small town hoods who move to the big city to make a name for themselves in the criminal underworld. Rico quickly raises up the ranks, earning the nickname "Little Caesar" and shows a skill for planning heists. Rico overthrows his boss Sam Vettori (Stanley Fields) and becomes one of the leading gangsters in the city. But of course with notoriety he becomes a target of other gangsters and the police, led by Sergeant Flaherty (Thomas E. Jackson), as well as alienated his old friend. g The best aspect of Little Caesar was Robinson, a very talented actor who was able to give his role real menace, someone who is willing to be very ruthless, willing to use violence and has a Machiavellian personality who will do anything to gain power. He is smart but has an ego which is his downfall. Robinson embodied his character, a rags to riches to rags story out a small time thug making it big. It is very much like Scarface in story.Director Mervyn LeRoy was able to some nice camera movements, particularly for the time where the camera was often stasis. He also made a very quick film, it is only 76 minutes and the pacing lightening fast. If anything the film was a little too quick, we do not get to establish how some events happen, like Rico and Joe just going to he big city, easily meet a gangster and then overthrow himself in the first 30 minutes. I would have like to have seen a little more background, a little more detail, like what where these two people like in the small town, what was this small time like, wouldn't they need to prove themselves to a major gangster to show they were worthy and committed to the crew before joining it, what was the internal politics of the crew and that wouldn't there be more of a challenge to Rico becoming the leader seeing he was a nobody a few months ago. LeRoy also uses some text screens to skip over long periods of time instead of showing up. But Little Caesar does everything it wants to put across in its short running time very well and I expect that it was made as a part of a double feature.Whilst Robinson was very good in his role, it was the role that made his career, the rest of the acting is typical of the early 30s, over-the-top with the delivery, very melodramatic and speaking in that 1930s hard boiled way. Still it was the standard of the time and I have seen a lot worst acting in films.Little Caesar is a good film, but it is not a gangster film that we know now. This film is a more a character study and a story how someone could rise to top just so they could fall even further. It is a solid piece of film making for the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Grand-Daddy of All Gangster Epics!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In director Mervyn LeRoy's landmark crime thriller "Little Caesar," actor Edward G. Robinson typecast himself as a snarling, cigar-chomping, tough-guy gangster without a trace of compassion. Reportedly, the eponymous character that he portrayed was based on the real-life crime czar Al Capone. Robinson played variations on his gangster persona in subsequent films like the lightweight "A Slight Case of Murder" and the heavyweight "Key Largo." "Little Caesar" was based on W.R. Burnett's novel. This urban shoot'em up generated quite a bit of controversy when Warner Brothers released it. Some censors claimed the film served as a primer for hoodlums. Now, "Little Caesar" seems tame, even compared with other crime classics such as "The Public Enemy" and "Scarface." Although it was produced before the Production Code Administration acquired teeth to enforce its agenda in Hollywood, "Little Caesar" rarely depicts violence in all its savagery. We see Enrico "Rico" Bandello (Edward G. Robinson) blast innocent bystanders in two scenes. Never do we actually see him pull the trigger. LeRoy edited the action so the violence seems illusionary. In the opening scene, when our protagonist knocks over a gasoline station, he extinguishes the lights, plunging the place into darkness and then a couple of shots erupt. Later, at a night club, a similar incident occurs when Rico blasts Crime Commissioner McClure without realizing who he is shooting. He believes the crime commissioner is reaching to a piece when he blasts him. Nevertheless, all we see is the crime commissioner writhing in agony from Rico's bullets. Even when the violence occurs against Rico, we see no physical manifestation of it. Rico is walking along a city street in broad daylight when a milk wagon cruises past and a fusillade of lead slugs pours out of it and wounds our protagonist. We are never shown the gangsters inside firing the machine gun. The Code expressly forbade scenes of gangsters wielding machine guns because it glamorized the hoods.Basically, "Little Caesar" chronicles the rise and fall of Enrico "Rico" Bandello. Rico and his best friend Joe Massara (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.) are robbing gas stations in the sticks when Rico decides to clear out for the bright lights of the big city. A newspaper article about Diamond Pete Montana as the guest of honor at an underworld banquet catches Rico's eyes. Secretly, Rico dreams of being like Pete. Rico assures Joe, "I could do all the things that fella does, and more, only I never got my chance. Why, what's there to be afraid of?" Rico and Joe head off to the big city. Rico joins Sam Vettori's mob. Meanwhile, Joe lands a dancing job at the Bronze Peacock gambling club. As it turns out, Rico couldn't have chosen a worst time to join Sam's outfit.. Sam clamors about gun violence and urges his men to exercise self-discipline in the face of provocation. Rico doesn't espouse Sam's ideology. He states, "And when I get in a tight spot, I shoot my way out of it. Why sure. Shoot first and argue afterwords. You know, this game ain't for guys that's soft!" "If anybody turns yellow and squeals, my gun's going to speak its peace." Rico is both fearless but reckless. Rico creates chaos when he guns down Crime Commissioner McClure (Landers Stevens) as the latter appears to be procuring a pistol at the New Years' Eve celebrations at The Bronze Peacock. Not only does Rico kill the commissioner, but he also usurps his boss Sam after the job. Rico has nothing but contempt for Sam. "Sam, you can dish it out, but you're getting so you can't take it no more. You're through." Afterward, Rico's rise is meteoric. Along the way, after he topples Sam and the Big Boy gives him a boost up the ladder. Before long Rico has changes is residence and now it resembles the sumptuous interior of the Big Boy's office. Before long Rico is so big that the opposition tries to rub him out as he strolls down the street. Miraculously, the gunmen riding in a milk wagon try to strafe Rico into stitches with a machine gun.Robinson's performance is superb, and Mervyn LeRoy never allows "Little Caesar" to bog down. Ultimately, "Little Caesar" is a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A few expressionist sets were the sole interest I found in this. It's very dated as is nearly everything from the thirties. Rico is a pretty flimsy character, and dumb psychology is threaded through each scene. It's amazing how inarticulate people/scripts were in the thirties. Whether it's Rico standing up to give a speech and having zero to articulate, but nonetheless yammering on; or Fairbanks criminally-stoooopid girlfriend who doesn't understand the meaning of "Hurry!" Or, even dumber, she gets him shot. (Um, just leave the damned idiot behind, and let her take a bullet.) How does a guy put himself in danger to save such a dummy, when she can't even figure out rudimentary survival? After Rico goes into hiding, the movie realizes it doesn't have an ending and comes up with the weakest climax I've ever seen.Edward G. Robinson has such a narrow range ('sneery' and 'extra sneery') that his performance is unintentionally funny. All the clichéd gangster lingo makes an appearance; in my favorite scene characters toss projective tough-guy escalations at each other ("Maybe it's like this... see!") until I was laughing out loud.</fullReview>
