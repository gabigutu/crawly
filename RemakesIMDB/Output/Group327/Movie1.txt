		<shortDescription>"Ocean's Eleven" could never be made again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only real pleasure in "Ocean's Eleven" is being let into the Rat Pack circle for a couple of hours... The film stops all too frequently for guest spots and in-jokes, with a slow first hour... Compared to Jules Dassin's 'Rififi,' or to Phil Karlson's 'Five Against the House,' it pales considerably... 'Ocean's Eleven' is a weak heist film with the emphasis firmly on light humor, and few diverting escapades, but nobody cares because the cast includes the biggest stars of the day (Frankie, Dino, Sammy etc...), burning the motion picture into the collective memory of the public as the first to showcase Hollywood's notorious Rat Pack...'Ocean's Eleven' is a buddy movie made with real buddies, and it's fun... It in't supposed to be very good... It is supposed to be cool... A playground for legendary entertainers, these guys knew how to get the job done, to pause only to knock back innumerable Whisky sodas, wear their tuxedo, hang out in bars, talk the talk, belt out a couple of classy little numbers, and have a great sense of fun together on screen... And this fun filtered off the silver screen and into the audience like a tasty appetizer before the main course...Old Blue Eyes is the mastermind of the heist... He is carrying out a plan originated by racketeer Spyros Acebos where five gambling casinos (Sahara, Riviera, Desert Inn, The Sand and The Flamingo) will be robbed simultaneously at midnight on New Year's celebration...During the week before Christmas, the 'special combat team' (all experts in one thing and another) arrive in Las Vegas, for the job-of-a-lifetime... The scheme of the robbery is ingenious, requiring military precision and perfect timing... An electrical tower will be blown up to black out the whole town... The swag will be deposited in garbage cans outside the casinos, and the cans will be collected by a disposal truck... On New Year's Eve, the hold-up goes off beautifully, exactly as planned... Only one of the men has a heart attack on the street and collapses... The gang cannot get the multi-million loot out of Las Vegas but they manage to hide it in some place, unknown to them, however, that 'someone' was preparing for them all a nice wry outcome... Dean Martin, the eternal essence of cool, is the entertainer who sings "Ain't That a Kick in the Head,' and Sammy Davis Jr. is the perennial icon of cool who sings "EEO-Eleven.'Peter Lawford is the playboy with one objective and one mission: To hit Las Vegas, Nevada!Angie Dickinson is the understanding wife, discreet, feminine and chic... Unfortunately the camera does not especially flatter her looks...Richard Conte is the master electrician dying of cancer, who needs to leave some cash for his kid's college...Cesar Romero is coldly menacing and very amusing: 'They shouldn't have done it while I was in town. It's embarrassing!'George Raft is the mob with the best deal to get the money back...Akim Tamiroff is hilariously neurotic as the master planner...Buddy Lester wants to get his wife out of stripping...Shirley MacLaine is the drunk gal in urge for a little kiss in a critical moment...Red Skelton is the unlucky player, arguing with the casino cashier how to raise his gambling limit..."Ocean's Eleven" could never be made again... The new 'Ocean's Eleven,' 2001 is considerably different in the details.. After all, there was only 'one' Rat Pack, and if the Ocean's Eleven of 1960 is anything, it is certainly a Rat Pack movie... So if you still have a strange fascination with this gang of friends, and like to watch essentially a these guys playing around on screen, and to watch Las Vegas as it looked in 1960, well... check out this nostalgic trip back... You'll never see its like again...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimate Rat Pack Outing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ocean's 11 never tries to be brilliant and is only sometimes good. The thin plot is a set up for the "boys" to look sharp (and they sometimes do), sing songs (which they do well) and to show off 1960 Las Vegas (which by today's standards looks pretty shabby).  This is a second rate heist story with a few gangsters thrown in. But after all, we have Sinatra and company. You can see that the excellent film, The Rat Pack, was very right on. Sinatra is his arrogant self. Martin is relaxed, Lawford is suave and the singing by Sammy Davis Jr. is great.Ocean's 11 is a snap shot of what was "cool" in the ultimate era of coolness. It's all here, the clubs, the Marilyn Monroe look a likes, the flashy clothes and lots of money. It's better than imitations such as Swingers since Ocean's 11 is the source. Of course it includes the legendary bad treatment of women and African Americans. The actresses are either add-ons or pathetic martyrs (Angie Dickinson). As for Sammy, he puts up with the garbage man part, a racial slur (all in good fun of course!) and the self centeredness of these guys. I just admire him because he had to do it, so he could perform.Back to the "fun". The boys get to be clever, then there's a surprise ending and finally we see them shuffle hung over in front of a casino. Every few years I check out Ocean's 11 not just to watch this silly movie but also to see the rats (or brats?) and chuckle (and wince) at an amazing time in the USA, baby.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fun snapshot of the Rat Pack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version of 'Ocean's 11' hardly needed a plot, did it? Just an extended ad for the Rat Pack's Vegas shows and the enormous ego of Frank Sinatra, here strutting his stuff as Danny Ocean, leading his war chums in a plan to rob numerous casinos in one night.So we get Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Peter Lawford, and Joey Bishop (did they play characters in this? can anybody remember who?) and a fun romp to the pay off - still getting referenced in films being made today. George Clooney's remake was nowhere near as much fun. There's music in this movie, of course (with that cast you'd be disappointed if not), plus appearances from Angie Dickinson, Shirley MacLaine (uncredited but noticeable), Cesar Romero, and Errol Flynn's widow Patrice Wymore.This really is a lightweight lark if you're in the mood. Is it a good film? Probably not. Is it good entertainment? Absolutely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Heist of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember back in the day when the commercials were out for Ocean's Eleven it was described as the heist of all time. It wasn't exactly that, but there is a spirit of camaraderie that is present through out the film. Frank Sinatra had signed a picture deal with Warner Brothers and was beginning a long term commitment to the Sands in Las Vegas. What better way than to combine everything at once. A film on location in Las Vegas. So Frank got his pallies together and they filmed Ocean's Eleven in between shows at the Sands. They also managed to get into another film, several of the principal players in Ocean's Eleven did guest shots in Pepe while at the Sands.Ocean's Eleven has a lighthearted insouciance about it, a group of former Airborne Rangers get together in Las Vegas for a heist of the big casinos carried on with military precision. Why waste all that good airborne training now that they're civilians.Sinatra doesn't sing in this, I can't imagine why he didn't give himself a song here, but Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, Jr. did sing two numbers suited to their talents. Ocean's Eleven marked the first time that Richard Conte worked in a Sinatra film. He became a Sinatra retainer in his later years, appearing in several Sinatra films. They parted when Conte appeared in The Godfather against Frank's wishes. After Ocean's Eleven came Sergeants Three with the main cast members appearing again. After that the Rat Pack broke up with these guys going their own way, though many of them did have joint projects together over the years. The quality of the films went down hill, except for Robin and the Seven Hoods. That was a musical and not something to be done in your spare time.The remake of Ocean's Eleven that George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and several other name players of today did was a far more serious film. Good in its own way, but just not the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1960 Ending / 2000 Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Ocean's 11 will always remain a classic because of the Rat Pack. It is unfair to compare both Ocean 11's movie because of the different cast, different stories, and completely different endings. Still, looking at both films, you can make a case for both why each is better than the other. Frankie, Dean, Sammy, Peter and Tony are all gone now, making the cast of the original legendary. The remake is more realistic as it answers many if not all the questions that the original failed to answer. Even for a Rat Pack movie, the original turns out to be more campy that the remake. The ending alone is worth discussion. In 1960, how wrong is it to have the criminals get away clean? For 2000, it is not only welcomed but rewarded if the "little guy" can out do or cheat the big system. For 1960, the ending of Ocean's 11 advertises that crime does not pay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's your drink?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While other movies try to induce the willing suspension of disbelief, this movie goes the entire opposite direction and never lets us forget that these are entertainers putting on a performance. In case you weren't entirely sure, the closing shot leaves no doubt. As one reviewer perfectly describes it, "The blurred boundaries between showbiz and private life seem to have vanished for good." That's quite an accomplishment!The stars aren't acting, they're partying down in an elaborate role-playing game and inviting you the viewer to play along with them. Join the party and for 2 hours you too can be a swinging, sophisticated member of the rat pack who can simultaneously handle a martini and cigarette in one hand and doesn't have to pause for even a second when somebody asks "what's your drink?". "Ocean's Eleven" is the "Pulp Fiction" of the Kennedy era - a movie that makes you feel hip just to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Kings of Old Vegas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ocean's Eleven is the definitive Rat Pack film. I have not seen the remake, but it's hard to imagine a new crew who could pull off a Las Vegas heist like old Frank, Sammy, Dean, and all the rest. Ocean's 11 represents a period of time when the Rat Pack were at the top of their game. I really liked the simplicity of the film, that snappy and campy Rat Pack humor. The film has a great score by Nelson Riddle and the intro/opening credits of the movie were very imaginative for its day. Watching this movie, I was almost rooting for the guys to pull off the heist and get away with it. The movie also features Angie Dickinson, who plays Sinatra's long-suffering wife, Cesar Romero as a shady character who is engaged to Peter Lawford's mother, and Norman Fell (who went on to play Mr. Roper in Three's Company) as one of the Eleven. Shirley Maclaine also has an uncredited cameo. It's definitely a must for any Rat Pack fan!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good old fashioned well humoured heist flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen the new remake of this movie yet, but they have some pretty big shoes to fill. Technically Ocean's Eleven may not be a great film, but whatever minor plot shortcomings that exist are made up for in spades by immeasurable style.I'm not going to explain the plot, as I'm sure that 50 other people already have. It's been a while since I've watched an older movie, so I found the loose-yet-confident chemistry and acting of the brat pack members to be very refreshing. They seemed so natural around each other, which is no surprise considering that they were buddies in real life. Sammy Davis Jr. was his usual charismatic self (why didn't he take off with the money??), Dean Martin seemed to be playing himself, a bit tipsy and sweaty with a drink in one hand and a smoke in the other, as he does in most of his films, and Frank Sinatra was also good as the understated womanizing organizer. However, I thought that Cesar Romero (known for his manic portayal of the Joker in the 60's Batman tv series) really stole the show right out from under the overly confident brat pack...I found his performance to be very commanding and impressive. A nice surprise to see comedian Red Skelton and Norm Fell (Three's Company's Mr. Roper!) in there as well!A few things hilariously go unexplained, like how they all managed to get casino jobs virtually overnnight, but it hardly seemed to matter. You know this movie is basically just a vehicle for the brat pack, and it's pure entertainment to just watch all these legends hamming it up, especially during the couple of musical interludes where you get to hear Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. croon a few really catchy songs, like E-O Eleven!At the same time it's also a window into another era, a time of larger than life Hollywood stars. Another thing that really jumped out at me was how unabashedly politically incorrect this movie is, showcasing a dramatically different mentality than what we see in movies today. Ocean's Eleven is a pure guy flick, where all the women are no more than window dressing and are treated as such by the male characters. As dated as the macho attitude of the film may seem nowadays (and even already by late 60's standards), I found it to be a fascinating glimpse into the past when guys were guys and women were umm, dames! As ironic as it is, I found seeing this old movie without the typical modern day contrived politically correct preaching to be very refreshing, and somehow strangely rebellious!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two years ago, when I was twelve years old, I watched a video called On the Town.Uneducated little dunce that I was, before that I'd known only vaguely of Francis Albert Sinatra. And after spending half the movie trying to figure out which of the three sailors WAS the Sinatra of whom I had heard vaguely, I finally decided correctly on the adorable, skinny one with blue eyes. And promptly after that, I announced to several uninterested audiences that I was a fan. I am now fourteen. I have read 60 or 70 biographies on him and his contemporaries, have seen approximately 25 of his sixty movies, have heard and memorized a sizable amount of his complete discography, have written quite a few essays and reviews, and would be more than happy to recite to you a detailed account of his career, life, and the tremendous gossip and legends that followed it about.I think those uninterested parties are starting to believe me.In any case, I am a definitive Sinatra adorer writing a review for one of his movies, so I'll warn you before hand: it may be a little bit biased, but I'm going to be as honest as I can. All right. You've been warned. Carry on then.The main problem I've read about in these ''instructive criticism reviews,'' is that this movie moves much too slowly, meaning that for the first hour or so the picture is about Frank and company, not about eleven guys holding up a couple of casinos. I readily admit that, and so much the better. If you expected to see the latter when you saw the posters proclaiming FRANK SINATRA!! DEAN MARTIN! SAMMY DAVIS JR.!!, you are extremely dense and certainly deserve your disappointment. Yes, believe it or not, this is a RAT PACK movie, and as such it happens, by a strange twist of fate, to be about the Rat Pack. Elementary, my dear Watson.Another complaint involves severe lack of plot.(See above inscription.)Yet another of the whiners has pouted that none of the cast appears to have much interest in what they're doing. I would like to mention here that, like they themselves modestly pointed out in a gag used frequently on various Vegas stages, they could do this kind of stuff anytime they wanted to. At this moment in time Frank Sinatra was the #1 singer in the country, the #1 box office attraction in the country, one of the highest paid individuals who ever won an Oscar or a Grammy, the biggest draw in Las Vegas, or anywhere else for that matter, had more power than all the Harry Cohns and Louis B.Mayers put together, and was on his way to Camelot with Senator John Fitzgerald Kennedy. The Rat Pack playing at the Sands was such a gigantic draw they were having to turn down thousands of reservations, and when Ocean's 11 was released it immediately made the list for the biggest box office smashes of all time.In other words,even if the whiner's complaint is true, (and I don't think it is) it's laughable to imagine that the Clan's not especially caring whether or not they won Academy Awards would stop either the success of the movie or (ha) their careers.Anyway, if they are blasé in the picture, they are the coolest not-caring actors in show business. There is also a much more serious accusation that many people actually believe. And I honestly believe that this accusation is not true. This rumor involves the color conscious sixties, some allegedly racist jokes, and Sammy Davis Jr.Yeah, the Rat Pack told some jokes about Sammy. On the Copa Room stagemany an audience would roar at stupid gags like ''Keep smilin' Smoky, so everyone knows where you are" and '' Nat King Cole was a merry old soul.A merry old soul was Nat King Cole.... A merry old COLORED soul,'' and ''Have you noticed how much better it sounds when he does his own people rather than our people?'' And, of course there were the times when Dean would scoop little Sammy up in his arms, waltz forward, and say ''I'd like to thank the NAACP for this trophy.''Sam, for his own part, would come on after Dean sang ,''Did you ever see a Jew - jitsu? Well, I did.'' and complain on cue ''How would you like it if I said,' Did you ever see a wop-SICLE!!!''It didn't mean a thing. It wasn't cruel. It was corny, hilarious chatter between three grown-up boys who treated each other - and kidded each other- like brothers. It's only since then that the situation has been contorted into a racial injustice by idiots who are looking for a fight. That's all.I guess that about sums up the Defence's case, unless the Prosecution has anything it wishes to add. No? All right then.I love this movie. I'll admit that. I know there is probably a grand total of 3 critics out there who agree with me, but I'm not a critic. I'm a fan. I'll never tire of watching Sam dancing on garbage cans as he sings Ee-o-eleven, or be bored watching Dean, with his nonchalant cool, croon about you-know-what being a kick in the head, and I can't watch that last scene enough where Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis Jr. stroll past The Sands' sign that advertises.... I'd better not give it away. Watch it yourself.There are plenty of better movies out there- but there was only one Rat Pack.And, no matter what anyone say's- They were magic. This is magic.Ring-a-ding ding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rat Pack in a pretty amusing heist romp movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The picture talks about the biggest robbery of all . Spyros Acebos (Akim Tamiroff) pulls off a scheme introducing the plans for a new business venture : simultaneously burgle five casinos in Las Vegas as Sahara , Flamingo , Golden Nugget , Riveira and Desert Inn . He agrees with Danny Ocean (Frank Sinatra) backed by a motley and eclectic gang to execute it , formed by 11 pals ( Dean Martin, Peter Lawford, Sammy Davis, Richard Conte , Norman Fell, Richard Benedict..). The crew back in action , now veterans , after fighting in Second World War at 82nd Airbone division as paratroopers . We wouldn't call it a special group just Danny Ocean and his buddies , the night they blew up all the light , shutting off the electricity in Las Vegas . Millions dollars are taken from the casinos . But the elaborated plan itself goes wrong . They encounter complications when an investigator (Cesar Romero) discovers the tracks . This adaptation achieves one of the greatest entertainments of the history of motion pictures . We never met a band like Ocean's eleven .From the beginning until the end the comedy and giggles along with moderated action are continuous . Besides , it has got an intelligent script and an extraordinary final surprise . Significant portions of the movie interactions between major characters were ad-libbed . The actors playing the leading roles all knew each other well and improvised dialogue as well as or better than the script . For comic relief in charge of the various relationships among several characters and their numerous jokes . Splendid songs by Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr and sensitive ending song by Frank Sinatra . Appears uncredited Shirley McLayne in an agreeable comic performance , Red Skelton and George Raft as invited actors . Superb and stunning musical score by Nelson Riddle (author of Batman TV music). Enjoyable and glossy cinematography by William H. Daniels (Greta Garbo's usual photographer). Director Lewis Milestone's masterpiece of the amusement and entertainment . The movie was remade by a funny and stylish remake with George Clooney and director Steven Soderbergh and several sequels . Rating : Good and nice . Worthwhile watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The exception of what rule? The Rule that says (at least as listed in most books) that the original (movie) is better than the remake. Well here comes this movie, to show you, that that isn't the case. A shame then, because the stellar cast (after all you get to see the Rat Pack at work here!) promises so much more, than you actually will get out of it! Although it seems to be more the fault of the script than the cast, I can assure you that I did watch this movie before I watched the remake (which is crucial, to not be afflicted by the impact of the movie) and it just doesn't sustain the comparison with the remake! That's how I felt!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie stinks but looks cool.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when I was a little kid. Being a big Sinatra fan and a lover of 60's and 70's movies I watched it again last night. I remembered loving it as a kid but now I have to say that this movie stinks.Sure it looks all 60's cool and has Sinatra, Martin, and Davis but honestly it was Cesar Romero who stole the show. Romero housed every member of the rat pack. This guy was on a different level from the rest of the cast and it showed. Sinatra was phoning it in as was Martin. The only guys even trying to act were Davis and Lawford. After the film was over I had a new found respect for Cesar Romero.Okay now that I've crapped on the acting which was mediocre with the exception of Cesar R. I really have to crap on the writing, but this is more like something after eating five black bean burritos with chiles and a quart of Mexican tap water.Who is the Greek guy? Why is he even in the film? It looks like Sinatra has the thing planned out what did this guy do? I guess he was there for comic relief but not only was he annoying but his purpose is never really explained. Why would the 11 cut him in, he didn't do anything.Next, you mean to tell me that there is no security in the money room at a casino. I mean basically these guys turn off the lights and only have to subdue one or two money counters before getting to the safe at each casino. I can suspend my disbelief as much as the next guy but you'd have to be brain dead to buy into this part of the story.Finally, the Ocean's 11 gang are spread out from Phoenix to Salt Lake, to San Francisco and Los Angeles. The gang descends on Vegas to pull the heist but then as a matter of coincidence everybody's mistress, mom and fiancé also decide to go to Vegas for the New Year's festivities, to throw a monkey wrench in the heist and put Cesar Romero on the case. The script is weak. Decent story but the execution is lame from the get go.After seeing so many rave reviews for this flick I just had to chime in. Giving it a 9 out of 10 because this "isn't supposed to be a good movie" is a sorry excuse. So is the lame excuse "hey these guys are just being themselves and goofing off like they do when the cameras aren't rolling." To my eyes the Rat Pack weren't having fun. They looked bored and like they were all mailing it in. Looks more like they had a contractual obligation to make this flick and they didn't put any effort into it. Like I said the only guys trying were Sammy Davis Jr, and the scene stealing Cesar Romero.As a heist film this movie stinks. Rating 1/10 Good premise, that's it. Acting stinks for the most part: 3/10 (Cesar gets an 11/10.) Script: 0/10 Style Points: 8/10 pretty cool display of 60's cool. Needed more exteriors and cars to bring it to 10/10 the sets were cheap too.Overall a 4/10 for me. Sinatra and gang normally cool but are borderline lame in this movie and it's the script that should have been put in that casket with Richard Conte, not the mony.</fullReview>

It was still great to see the likes of Donald O'Connor and Red Skelton as the headliners and see the elegant lounges where thery would all perform,up close and personal not for 100-300 feet away. You could walk up to them after a performance and actually chat with them as they left the stage. Everyone was dressed in suits,tuxedos, and formal dresses, wearing furs and everyone smoking. If you remember the the days of no cell phones, using the operator to make long distance calls, no computers, walkmans, cassette and 8 tracks tapes, then this is one movie you should love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unpolished gem; a Mission-Adventure Comedy With Characters and Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please, forget whatever you have heard about this film. It is a very interesting adventure-comedy, very-well directed, decently-acted and intelligently presented. The "Rat PacK' whom singer Frank Sinatra had gathered about him in the late 1950s and early 1960s included singers Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin, comic Buddy Lester and Joey Bishop and actor Peter Lawford. This is the best film this group of friends ever made together, one absolutely filled with interesting character revelations, old Sinatra songs used as background and fine co-stars including Ilka Chase, Cesar Romero, Angie Dickinson, Akim Tamiroff, Richard Conte, Henry Silva, Patrice Wymore, Norman Fell, Richard Benedict, Jean Willes, Clem Harvey and George Raft. This effort has very good dialogue, many interesting confrontations between characters and the best portrait of Las Vegas 1960 available anywhere. It also has that rare achievement, style,, and a fascinating plot-theme. Danny Ocean's old outfit from WWII have been home 15 years-- and they are finding there is no place in a corporate-government bureaucratized United States for independent minds--they are all facing a "system" that wants no part of men who think for themselves or want justice and are willing to work to get it. Enter Tamiroff, who plays an idea man--Acevos--who with the help of Sinatra and Lawford concocts a daring plan to rob several Las Vegas casinos on New Year's Eve of millions of dollars. The plan requires commando-like precision and skills--so Ocean recruits his hungry war buddies, ranging from Conte with a serious heart condition who wants to do something for his son, to Lawford who just wants to recapture the wartime sense of purpose, to bright, talented Sammy Davis, stuck on a garbage truck. The plan is initiated and set into motion step-by-interesting step; but even when it comes off flawlessly, the outfit is not home free. Chase's fiancée, Romero as Duke Santos, a man who plays the percentages and has gone legit is hired by the casinos' owners to find the money for a finder's fee; and he puts two and two together--and comes up with eleven. The surprise climax, as the money, secreted for out-of-town delivery in the coffin of a dead Richard Conte, ends up being burned in a cremation ceremony as the group are present for the funeral is a classic of its sort. Of course, this disaster robs Ocean's team of their proceeds, but keeps Santos from profiting and makes sure they do not go to jail. At the end, the eleven wander into the sunlight, to ponder perhaps another scheme to get the justice that seems to be nowhere for them. The film has a very-special look. with Nelson Riddle's music, Lewis Milestone's veteran direction and a good script as its main underproppings. This is a storyline so strong it can be a mission film, an adventure and a satirical comedy at the same time. its authors can digress, make a joke at their own expense and deliver a telling one-liner with powerful effect. It has characters, warmth, and much more. An unpolished gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great opportunity wasted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contrary to many other reviewers here who gave the film a poor rating, I'm not complaining about the plot. In fact, the plot of the film is not so bad, and certainly not weaker than that of the 2001 remake (which I liked much more than this original). It's just that this work doesn't develop the plot very well: The first half of the film is wasted on people talking other people into participating in the coup (which, in the end, they do, of course). The planning stage is virtually non-existent - Frank Sinatra simply pulls out a handkerchief with a "map" of Las Vegas and lays out the plan in detail, anticipating and refuting all possible objections. The preparation stage goes on smoothly, with the team's electrician simply walking into restricted areas of the casinos and re-wiring key electrics of the houses without being bothered by security. Too implausible for me to believe. Then the execution of the plan, which is almost a minor sub-sequence of the film to which the director did neither devote much time nor love for detail. The rest of the film is wasted on an overly extended plot about the gang trying to escape capture and get the money out of town. The setting of priorities could have been better, I dare say.Clearly the film draws some bonus points from its all-star cast, but it does not employ them very well. The dialogues are mostly wooden - even sequences where there would have been an opportunity to intersperse some witty lines are handled rather unlovingly and with dull, flat dialogues (there are some exceptions to this, such as a nice little sequence with Dean Martin and Shirley MacLaine in a cameo as a drunken casino guest, but gems of this sort remain rare). The rat-pack stars don't even get much chance to display their talents in full, with only Sammy Davis Jr and Dean Martin getting one rather short song each.To me, it seems that this film was just another step in Frank Sinatra's ultimately unsuccessful attempts to establish a noteworthy film career. An opportunity wasted, since with a setting and a cast like this, something much better could have been produced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic best left in the 60s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know it's unfair to judge a historical piece from a modern perspective, but I can't help but throw in some of my own personal bias against this Dino quote: "(If I were elected in public office) I'd repeal the 14th and the 20th; take the vote away from women and make them slaves." That quote was enough to ruin my illusions of the movie. It was hard to believe that even in the 60s it was OK for men to say stuff like this in the mainstream. *Sigh* Another thing that sucked was the end -- how is it that after all they went through, they didn't get to keep their loot? Once again, I suspect they had to appeal to the (unfortunate) white and self-righteous general public that would've just been up in arms about the thieves getting away with their crimes at the end. It just wasn't satisfying to watch all of these cool cats walk away from Vegas empty-handed. Again, I suppose at the time this film was made, such ending would never have been accepted. (But still!)However, it's a fun movie and nothing takes away the fact that this is was the "IT" movie - super cool, suave and Rat-Packed! Dino and Sammy Davis, Jr. make this film so smooth with their numbers. It was truly awesome to watch them perform. I wouldn't call it a musical, however, because their numbers were brief and scattered, rather than often and organized. I think that's what made it fun: you never know when they're going to belt it out for the audience.This is what makes me think that this movie was made primarily to get the Rat Pack together in a film. It was fun to watch all of these debonair gents strut down the Vegas Strip on New Year's Eve, but if watched for anything other than this angle, you may be slightly disappointed. Good thing I'm something of a Dino fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could this film be any dumber???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a bad movie. A bad premise, a bad plot, bad actors, bad script, bad camera work, I bet even the catering was bad. I'm too young to know of the Rat Pack in their "glory" days, but this movie would make a terrible legacy.Set in the tinny, gilded era of Las Vegas, the members of the Rat Pack conspire and (somehow) rob five of the casinoes on The Strip. With a see-through thin plan, they manage to rob these casinoes of millions. Were it so easy! Obviously the casinoes didn't have the security today's casinoes have, but it stretches my suspension of disbelief much too far to believe that the security was so lax. One of the eleven runs around playing with the wires in all of these casinoes without anyone so much as seeing him, all in broad daylight! If the casinoes were this easy to rob, people would be robbing them by accident!Another problem with the movie was the motivation of each of the characters to rob these places. The only guy who had any motivation at all was Anthony Bergdorf (Richard Conte), the one who had terminal cancer (who happened to "suddenly" die from it moments after the heist). The rest seemed to be doing fairly well financially, judging by their expensive clothing and their posh digs. I suppose Josh Howard (Sammy Davis, Jr.) had a motivation as well, being a poor black trashman (who owns a pretty expensive suit that he wore to the organizational meetings). But this was at the end of the Fifties, and Howard was barely allowed to hang out with the rest of them, and probably would have gotten screwed out of the money in the end anyway.The funniest problem was the dialogue. That script used more similies and metaphors than a dog has fleas. At some points in the movie I was never quite sure what the characters were saying because of the archaic euphamisms being used.All in all, this film was one big throbbing pile of cheese. It's a caricature of the Fifties, the Rat Pack, and of itself. I've heard that these people were playing themselves in this movie. If so, the Rat Pack seems to be a group of self-absorbed, arrogant, greedy, base, immature little boys, riding around in the lap of luxury and bemoaning problems of their own making. If you're still wearing your bobby socks and poodle skirts and are disgustingly in love with this group, I suppose you could suffer through it, otherwise keep your conception of the Fifties and the Rat Pack pure and avoid this horrid movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best times I've had watching a movie. Not having grown up in the era of the Rat Pack, I'm just now discovering the films made by this legendary bunch of guys. I watched Ocean's Eleven with a combination of laughs and suspense. It's a great idea for a story because it keeps you guessing but it's also got a bit of a campy feel to it. Like when everyone keeps saying "Duke Santos!!" whenever they hear the guy's name. It quickly became a favorite catchphrase at our house! The camp factor in no way detracts from the film, however. I won't give anything away about the end, but I seem to recall my jaw hitting the floor during and after the funeral scenes. I really felt for those guys! I'm anxiously awaiting for the 2001 remake just for comparison's sake. I don't know how they could do it justice but I'm just curious enough to check it out. The original is a movie buff's dream. Just knowing that Frank, Sammy, Dean, and the rest were in Vegas having the time of their life makes it all the more intriguing. For anyone looking for good solid entertainment, Ocean's Eleven delivers!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Danny Ocean (Frank Sinatra) and Jimmy Foster (Peter Lawford) have gathered war buddies to pull off a new commando raid. They plan to rob five Las Vegas casinos on New Year's Eve. Beatrice (Angie Dickinson) is Ocean's ex. Sinatra's playmates Dean Martin, Joey Bishop and Sammy Davis join him to have some fun.This was a great excuse for Sinatra to gather his Rat Pack and party in Vegas. The script is surprisingly pedestrian. The setup meanders in an endless series of boring scenes. The cinematic style is stiff. The performances are nothing to write home about either. It may be that the best performances happened off screen as the buddies drank the nights away. The saddest thing is that this is a waste of good talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ain't that a kick in the head? Ironically those words sum up my exact feelings on this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Running with the general consensus that the original is better than the remake, I decided to sit down and watch the 1960 'Rat Pack' original version of Oceans 11 and words honestly can't express how disappointed I felt after watching it.The film starts OK and has a light comedic approach and starts to build its foundations pretty well. I'm prepared to accept that Oceans 11 needs some build up in order to establish the players involved in the heist; whilst it starts out fun, it quickly becomes arduous and generally very tedious to sit through the over-long introduction. Was the soap opera aspect with Danny Ocean and his wife really necessary? Oceans 11 redeems itself slightly in the second half when we finally get to the heist which I'll admit was quite clever and imaginative. Despite this though, the original version of Oceans 11 just seemed to be missing something; it lacked any sort of spark, it lacked fun and any real excitement. It's been a long time since I've seen the remake so I'm not really in a position to give a 'blow by blow' analysis of the two films, but I do remember enjoying the remake much more than I enjoyed this film.The film throws in a plot twist later involving heads of the 5 Casinos and Duke Santos (who figures out that Oceans gang have stolen the money). The Casino bosses offer Santos 30% of the total money that's stolen if he's successfully able to recover the full amount. This twist perked my interest, but it never went anywhere and seemed pointless when we then learn what direction the film took at the end (I'll admit it was surprising, but not in a good way - I actually found the ending a bit dumb and anti-climactic if I'm being totally honest).I had high hopes for this film and figured that because I enjoyed the remake that I must surely enjoy the original. However, despite a strong start, the odd bit of light humour and a relatively clever middle section, the film is counter-balanced by an over-long set-up, unnecessary soap opera and for the most part it just lacked fun and excitement. Mediocre and not worth bothering with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that the movie went along at a fast enough pace. It gave us time to get to know the characters--their personal lives and their backgrounds and Ocean's connection to each of them. And, of course, it seems "dated"; it was made in 1960, for Heaven's sake! I loved the singing of Sammy Davis and Dean Martin, and I happen to think "The Rat Pack" just had a special magic. That's not to say I'm a big fan of all the movies they did together, but "Ocean's Eleven" is fine! I love this movie and think it's much better than the remake. It was much funnier and much more entertaining. But, again, I think you have to be a "Rat Pack" fan to really appreciate it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sinatra and co in their first real rat pack outing and in the most appropriate place...Las Vegas. Its fun, its clever and its full of in jokes. Its not really for those that dont like Sinatra or the clan, as a lot of it will be over the head. However it shows the ease of the relationships, they are having a laugh and you can see that, making the idea of these men being a close nit ex-army group all the more realistic.Ok its not the greatest film in world and has been criticised for its sexism and the fact that no one seems bothered. The sexist remarks are tongue in cheek, the kind that would be heard in many a Gin-joint between a group of men. Take Martin's comments about taking the vote away from women and making slaves of them, a comment made in front of pals and a dream that I am sure many men would dream...oh come off it lads you would!Sinatra is cool, confident and hard. When he is called a rat he takes it with a vulnerability that shows that deep down he really isn't but he knows he acts that way. Martin is his witty, drunken, sexy self and Sammy is simply cool.Its not a film that will set the world on fire, its simply a chance to see a group of fine performers act together. Its a gem for anyone who has ever loved a rat packer and the famous ending sequence illustrates just how cool the guys really were as it was emulated in the classic 'Reservoir Dogs', proving sharp suits and attitude never go out of fashion.This is the most serious film made by the packers and its amazing to see them all acting together. The chemistry between Sinatra and Martin is magical, just as it is in may other films like the ultimate classic "some came running" in which the pair really shine, however in oceans eleven they have extra back up.Its a shame no more films were made, maybe a nice serious film for the critics, but thats not what it was all about, it was about fun, laughs and having your buddy's with you. So grab a martini and a cigerette and live live till you die.</fullReview>

The Rat Pack, interestingly enough, launches an attack on the hand that feeds them, Las Vegas. If that doesn't cue the viewer that it's time to suspend belief and hop on the rollercoaster of 1960s high living, this film is not for you. Of course it's unbelievable. It's meant to be as realistic as the proverbial paper moon. Those who can only look at the unpolitically correct past through 1990s lenses need to leave this film alone. However, if you find a certain fascination in the bad old times of the rich and famous Rat Pack, jump on board. It's a great ride!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like others, I decided to see this because of the hoopla for the 2001 remake. What a waste of time, but fortunately, I cut my losses after the first hour and started switching back and forth between the movie and war coverage on the news channels. I didn't miss anything. The pace was about as fast as frozen fudge dripping off an ice cream sundae: slug-like, in other words. Maybe 40 years ago, a story about a bunch of ne'er-do-well World War II vets was still relevant, but now the characters just seem like a bunch of boring losers. Presumably, whatever appeal this movie ever had was because of the novelty of the Ratpack celeb cast. Nowadays Ocean's 11 might serve as a curiosity piece showcasing the things Hollywood used to be able to say and portray in movies without a second thought: Chinese and blacks portrayed as stereotypical servants and servers (even Sammy does a Stepin Fetchit turn), women portrayed as occasionally necessary but mostly resented accessories (did the Taliban get their ideas on how to treat women from this movie????). And how annoying was Akim Tamiroff in his role? Skip this piece of dreck - spend the time cleaning out your refrigerator or something - at least the fridge will live up to its "cool" reputation.</fullReview>

The film is fast, fun and totally satisfying, all the way to its O. Henry-type ending.Besides having an interesting plot and actors who don't take themselves too seriously, "Ocean's Eleven" provides an interesting glimpse into the Rat Pack era, when being cool was really hot.

		<fullReview>Dull movie. Really just made to cash in on the fame of the Rat Pack - Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr, Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop. If anyone else had made this movie nobody would have watched it.As mentioned, it is all about the Rat Pack. So, more style than substance, and the style hasn't aged well. While a misogynistic, cheesy-dialogue-cracking, smooth-operator swagger might have worked in the 1960s, it just seems lame now.Despite all the attempts at smoothness, there are heaps of faults in the plot and performances. Editing too. Eg When Dean Martin meets Angie Dickinson for the first time in the movie, he says "Good day, Mrs Oceans", when her surname is Ocean. Would have been nice if Dean Martin had bothered to read the script and the director had bothered to do another take...So, very rough around the edges, as if Sinatra and co made the movie in a rush and didn't bother too much about the finer details.Performances are pretty weak. In fact, the only good ones are from non- Rat Packers, Angie Dickinson especially.The 2001 remake was much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there are any fans of this movie out there I'm sorry, but I didn't think this movie was very good. At all really. The plot was very hard to follow, the acting wasn't that good, and the soundtrack basically consisted of two songs. Ain't That a Kick in the Head by Dean Martin and Eee-O-11 by Sammy Davis Jr. , both of which were played over and over though out the film. By the end of the film, I was so sick of those songs I wanted to scream. And Frank Sinatra didn't sing at all which was kinda the main reason I watched the movie in the first place. To hear him sing. Big disappointment there. But Sinatra was the highlight of the film anyway. I always enjoy his performances, no matter how bad the film itself is. If I were a viewer, I would watch the remake of this film instead. It's made much better and the acting is better as well. I'm sad to say it but this film was kind of a flop.</fullReview>

Frank Sinatra is discrete, his character who does not have the charisma that he did have the singer-actor. Dean Martin, who also had a good voice, his character can not be credible and Sammy Davis Jr with that indelible smile perfect for a front stage with the audience, but not so appropriate in a film.From the beginning until the end the comedy and giggles along with moderated action is continuous . Besides , it has an intelligent script and an extraordinary final surprise . For comic relief in charge of the various relationships among several characters and their numerous jokes . Splendid songs by Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr and sensible ending song by Frank Sinatra .

The movie took 40 minutes of introduction before even hinting at the sting operation. Meandering (supposedly improvised) dialogue, useless characters (there were many!), and throw-away scenes. Who knew it would be good source material. What's great about the remake, the actors look like they're having fun making the movie. Not to say that there was no fun on the set of the original, but it seems any bit of fun was captured off camera. You can make a drinking game and take a shot at every shot where one of the actors looks like they've just been through a drinking game. Any high class movie that can't shoot 11 people talking without breaking the action axis doesn't deserve viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** "Ocean's Eleven" is an enlightening movie about eleven war-time buddies who get together to pull off the multi-million dollar heist of the century. It was a slow paced movie. The glamour and glitz of Las Vegas, casino heists, and the `Rat Pack' made the movie almost like a Disney production. Almost like a pure fantasy. Between the song and dance and the whiskey, it takes a good hour for all these war buddies to gather together in the same place to get the show on the road. Once the introductions were made, the movie finally started rolling. It seemed that none of the characters had a real reason to knock off these casinos, except for Danny Ocean who is trying to win back his estranged wife. It was really enjoyable to watch these cool cats put this heist all together. Their hipness was ironic when taking into consideration the technical aspects of the operation. The explosives and the timing they had to get together was again fantasy like. They were to cause a power outage in Las Vegas and blowing up the vaults at precisely midnight on New Years.The ending was a total surprise. It was the last thing I expected to have happen. All this work they had done and to have it all go up in smoke. `Ain't that a kick in the head again?'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Heist movies are by nature slow, but the pace on this one is positively glacial. Frank Sinatra is Danny Ocean, ringleader for a squad of paratroopers who figure on striking it rich by hitting five big Las Vegas casinos on New Year's Eve.It's a great concept, and using it as an excuse for a Rat Pack summit meeting promises a lot. Those guys had talent to burn, and charisma, too. Unfortunately, "Ocean's Eleven" never really delivers. Sure, it's amusing in parts, but never funny enough to qualify as a comedy. It's too logically challenged to work as a caper flick. Worst of all, the film builds no real suspense for most of its two-plus hours of running time. As many folks have said already, it just took too long getting started. Obviously, "Ocean's Seven" would have been a better idea, focusing on three casinos, or even just one or two.I liked Dean Martin in this one a lot. His performance of the terrif "Ain't That A Kick In The Head" is a real charmer, and he fills out some other scenes nicely. But most of the gang is strictly surplus cargo. And Sinatra, well, he's great in a lot of movies, lending them the right mixture of vulnerability, range, and surprising self-effacement, but here he plays that same smug, hepcat hard guy that dragged down his Tony Rome movies and other lesser vehicles. Sure, the Chairman was cool and looks swell in those sharkskin suits, but I didn't like his character, and when he's the central figure, that ties down everything else from the get-go."Ocean's Eleven" is one of two '60s films I'd call "Happening pictures," the other being "Casino Royale," where the big reason for its existence seems to be simply to bring a lot of show biz talent in one place and let all else take care of itself. "Ocean's" works better than it otherwise would only because of nostalgia, for its view of the old pre-theme-park Vegas and a time when men were men and preferred unfiltered cigarettes and dames who blended well with the wallpaper. "Casino" was just stupid from the start, but "Ocean's Eleven" had a chance to be more, if the screenwriters plotted it out better, developed some focus, and crafted characters you could care about.One dynamite thing in the film everyone notes is the ending. There's two, and they are both good, the resolution of the story (alright, the writers had one inspired moment) and the final shot of the characters walking out with the names on the marquee behind them. That last shot has been recreated many times, from "Buckaroo Banzai" to Quentin Tarantino, but never surpassed. It's one moment of style that has some substance to it. Too bad substance is something the rest of the film is so desperately wanting.</fullReview>

The DVD is worth a look, especially for Frank Sinatra Jr's narrative track. Frank Jr (who refers to his dad as SINATRA throughout the discourse), did his homework - he does a most professional background story, pepperd with Angie Dickinson who didn't bother to watch the film first before adding her comments and thus stumbled with bad memories), really goes into a lot of detail that is refreshing. Also, the short pieces on five of the old 50's Casino's used in the film was a great look back 40 years ago. I loved the 2001 remake - it was truely suspenseful. If you do go back to the original, definitely check out Frank Jr.'s audio commentary which is superb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess that in 1960, if you brought Frank, Dino, and Sammy together in a movie, you could be skip a certain number of formalities. You could do away with character, with suspense, and with pacing. You could leave plot holes the size of Texas. You could have a half dozen major cast members without any dialogue at all, in fact. Because all you had to do was let Sammy and Dino sing a little and let Frank sweet talk the dames. Toss in some Rat Pack regulars (like Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop), a few friends (watch for Shirley MacLaine's couple minutes), a few cameos (Red Skelton) and there you have a movie. Today, viewers may be intrigued by the stars and amused by the appearances by TV mainstays Norman Fell and Caesar Romero. But it's easy to look at Ocean's Eleven from a distance and wonder what the point was.The plot is barebones. Danny Ocean (Sinatra) is getting the men of the 82nd Airborn unit together again for their latest mission. They're going to take out five Las Vegas casinos at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve. Ocean is a bit of a womanizer whose wife (Angie Dickinson) still loves him. Jimmy Foster (Lawford) is a rich playboy who wants out from under his mother's thumb. Josh Howard (Davis Jr.) is a garbage man who likes to sing. The rest of the gang includes a slow talkin' Texan, an ex-con who just wants to put his kid through college, and a bunch of other guys who seem to be mostly along for the ride. Ocean's gang is being aided by Spyros Acebos (Toch of Evil's incomparable Akim Tamaroff). And somewhere lurking on the outside is Duke Santos, a self-made millionaire with designs on Foster's mom and the gang's loot. In a perfect world, hilarious and suspensefully cool hijinks would ensue.But for a long time, nothing really happens. Getting the band back together takes nearly an hour of screen time. And it's impossible to watch that hour without thinking, "Gee, I'm no editor, but I know the movie would have worked better without that scene..." nearly a dozen times. This is made all the more disconcerting by the amount of talent at work behind the scenes on this movie. The editor who left the plot sagging was three time Oscar nominee Philip Anderson. The frequently bland (though at least blandly colorful) cinematography was by Oscar winner William Daniels. And directing the whole thing was Lewis Milestone, whose proficiency with comedy (The Front Page) and pathos (All Quiet on the Western Front) make him one of the great unsung directors of the early Hollywood Sound period. But the focus of the film seems to have been letting the Rat Pack get away with whatever they want, for better or worse.But why, oh why, doesn't Frank Sinatra sing? Dino gets to sing "Ain't that a Kick in the Head" over and over. And Sammy Davis Jr. gets two times through "E-O-leven." But Frank doesn't sing. He doesn't dance. He doesn't romance any of the dames. He doesn't punch anybody in the face. The remarkable thing is how Frank and most of the gang are able to retain their aura of Cool while doing absolutely nothing. They don't really act either, not that anybody embarrasses themselves, but they only rarely seem to be having fun (perhaps looking like you're really enjoying yourself isn't Cool). A late scene in which Sammy expresses amusement at the blackface the other robbers must don gives a hint of the kind of fun we're missing.There's some fun to be had in Ocean's Eleven. In the climactic New Year's Countdown, for example, Milestone makes use of the first recorded "balloon wipe" to cut between the five casinos. And even if Frank, Dino, Peter, Joey, and Sammy don't really seem as cool as you may have heard, or remembered, they're still a heck of a lot cooler than the people you hang out with. Still Ocean's Eleven is only good for 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The way I figure it is like this: the eleven of us cats against this one city...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "Ocean's Eleven" is an enjoyable, if starchy, romp through the decadent era of 1960's Vegas -- both literal and metaphorical. The Rat Pack make the experience an affable, stylish, smooth and sultry one -- but when don't they? It is their presence that largely serves to carry the dead weight of this relatively unremarkable film. The problems with "Ocean's Eleven" are many: clumsy editing, pitiful lighting and skimpy and incredulous plotting. The film lacks the ingredients necessary to stand out as a classic. Yet, in some senses, that's exactly what it is. And it does have its better elements lifting it to greatness: the opening title sequence is snazzy, the two tunes -- "E-O Eleven", sung by the irreplaceable Sammy Davis Jr, and "Ain't That A Kick In The Head", sung by the equally irreplaceable Dean Martin -- are classy and elegant, the acting and scripting is solid (if, like much of the film, unremarkable) and the ending is a corker. But there's something very limp and ineffectual about the whole thing as a piece of cinema.Perhaps the best thing to be said about "Ocean's Eleven", and it is something that works in synergy with the presence of the Rat Pack, is the journalistic quality of the film itself: this is 60's America, however idealised here, captured as a snapshot in time. There are lurid and shocking things (even if the film itself is neither), just as there are graceful and admirable things. It's an interesting sociological piece. In this respect then, because of the era and the cast itself, "Ocean's Eleven" manages to outstrip its remake. The remake might be a superior film -- but is it a superior experience? This film is relatively free of pretense and doesn't take itself too seriously. The photography is simple yet colourful rather than sophisticated yet dour, the original here has actual singing in it and the Rat Pack are just more fun because of their genuine chemistry. Also compare, for example, the ridiculous ease with which the casinos are robbed here -- with Rat Pack members spraying door handles in plain sight -- versus the Mission-Impossible-SWAT-Team approach in the remake. This version just seems more rapscallion, like Sinatra's Danny Ocean, and a little more, well... cheeky. The plot is served up with a brightness and breeziness befitting the glint in the eyes of Dino himself. Plus: there's just something impossibly cool about the way both men, Frank and Dino, hold their glasses and cigarettes. This film isn't ashamed to be manly if it means being incorrect."Ocean's Eleven" ain't a classic -- but, in its own special way, it manages to be a keeper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Oh So Boring, Casino Robberies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this horridly slow paced film, the Rat Pack, which consists of Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Frank Sinatra, Peter Lawford, and Joey Bishop, all fabulous actors, plus six other actors not in the rat pack, act as World War II veterans from the same war unit titled EO-11. They all reunite post war in Sin City, the City that Never Sleeps, (or as I call it Las Vegas), to scheme a wonderfully boring plan to heist all the cash in five of the largest casinos in one short ten to fifteen minute power outage. As you may guess for a dramatic finish, all goes well until the end.Dig deeper into this film and ask yourself: 'what is this film trying to achieve? What is the director trying to tell us? And did this movie accomplish what it was supposed to accomplish?' are questions the viewer should ask themselves. Since we can't know the mind of this director, we must come to our on conclusions. This, mind you, may change with each individual who watches this film. What the director portrays is when people bond in such a way that their life depends on another individual; there is nothing that can separate them. Not race, moral ethics, family issues, and other interesting things. Once we have trusted people with our lives and theirs with ours, we can never break that bond. Do I think that this movie accomplished this? I would say it did. Even though the movie itself was horrible, it still showed the bond between individuals that made a whole group of eleven people who were there for each other whenever there was a need, even if it came to money and robbing casinos. I would personally never watch this movie again. It was very slow moving, had a grim dialogue. Even with all the great performers, it was still a non-stellar movie. Then again who can pass up performances by Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., and Dean Martin all in one movie?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a difference a few decades make. When this movie was made, these were the coolest guys in the world for anyone over 25. They were cool because they thought so themselves and everyone believed them.At least we did then. Now we see not only a particularly bad caper movie, we see how uncool these guys really were. Frank was merely a selfish bully, the skinny kind who paid others to rough people up. So we see many stories here. We see the caper story.We see the story about 5 guys who pretended to matter and did for a while, long enough to make lots of money and have a lot of sex.But there's a bigger story here, one that this movie evokes more than any other I know. Its the story of America, the America defined by entertainers, the one the French New Wave thought was real. You can research it quickly by seeing "The Ocean's Eleven Story," a poorly made documentary, but one that hits most of the buttons.These guys, at this time, were behind making the Mob bigger than they ever had been before. They married the Mob with presidential politics, even pimping to the president. This was where Marilyn's suicide was made inevitable. And Mob hits on Castro, and the embarrassment of the FBI by RFK, and subsequent rage by Frank at being jettisoned.There is suicide and assassination behind their misogynistic prancing, their assumption that all they had to do was show up, and we would swoon.This is an important film, if you think film is important.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It really wasn't that great an idea to begin with--a remake of "Gunga Din" with Sammy as the "waterboy."As a matter of fact, the "Rat Pack" always seemed a rather low point in Sinatra's career. Here was a genuine vocal artist, who proved his mettle many times in his classic LP recordings, both at Columbia and Reprise. He significantly elevated the medium of popular song to an incredible level of respectability. When he toured, he utilized a full string complement, replete with horns and harp. And his choice of both repertoire and arrangers was exemplary.Thus, in this viewer's opinion, his entire Vegas period was a misguided enterprise, diminishing this great performer's ultimate legacy. Likewise for over half of his routine film choices."Ocean's Eleven" was one of those mistakes, as he did his near-Rat Pack-parody with sidekicks Martin, Davis, Lawford, and Bishop. Oh yes, they're fellow piasanos Conte 'n' Romero in the along the way, plus a few cameos by MacLaine, Raft and Skelton (and who was that unidentified "mystery man" seen from the back as Mr. S. strolls through the Sands?)Vegas always impressed me as a "Land for Loosers," glitzy as it may be. Those one-arm-bandits lining the casinos have built-in house-odds, no matter how much silver may gush out from time to time. "Ocean's Eleven" bears the Vegas aura of superficiality and the sorrow stemming from a "bad roll."Certainly Geore C. Johnson's and Jack G. Russell's story and script doesn't help matters. Nor does Lewis Milestone's slipshod production-direction (this director's total works record being around 50:50).So, "Ocean's" is a bit of a puffy red-eyed flick, which had best remained with those 3 am Pack sessions: banterings which revel in the night, but take flight at dawn.</fullReview>

It could have been better if the pace had quickened and they had limited themselves to fewer casinos. Hitting five casinos with eleven guys isn't just overextending your crime spree, it's overextending the movie. Like I said in the summary, the cops in this film are slow and useless.

		<fullReview>I originally saw this movie with my folks as a baby boomer kid of eight. My parent who were in their late 30s seldom went to movies but went out of their way to see this one. This was a big deal at the time, everybody's favorite celebrities in Vegas, wow! This was at a time when few could afford to go there and it was considered a far away exotic world for adventurous or special folks. I remember we had only NBC and CBS black and white television for regular entertainment essentially from 7pm to 9pm for the real stuff. For us Vegas was a dream land. We didn't really know what it was all about. Frankie and Dino acted like it was their personal playground, knew the ropes, how cool.From that time on my folks had it in their heads they someday would visit Vegas, when they had raised the kids and retired. And that's exactly what they did although it took another 20 years. Fank and Dino weren't there but they didn't seem to mind, they made it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Viva Las Vegas, the old one, that is...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was never meant to be a good film, much less, serious filmmaking. To get Lewis Milestone to direct the Rat Pack was a hopeless task. We don't believe for a moment these characters are none other than Frank, Dean, Sammy, Peter, Joey doing their shtick. Having watched the other night this original version on TMC, I can state that it was more fun to see the Las Vegas of yore than the "bore" of the new remake with all the high tech and highly paid "so-called-stars". The new version uses actors that pale in comparison with their older predecessors.The DVD that was shown on TV had very vivid colors and it looked more vibrant than Steven Soderbergh's own treatment. The new hotels might be more spectacular than the old ones shown here, but there was a certain glamour attached to them and a certain innocence, even though they all dealt in the same business they do nowadays. Perhaps because those hotels were for adults only, the old Las Vegas was much more fun than the present mess with theme hotels that perhaps were created for children who are allowed to bring their parents to gamble. The whole plot of the 1960 Oceans Eleven is absurd, but viewed right after the new remake, it made more sense, especially the end, which holds an ironic twist. Mr. Soderbergh's film implies a different outcome than Milestone's surprising end. Well, perhaps he knows better, or is he trying to tell us that crime, indeed does pay?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 2001 version of Ocean's Eleven is one of my personal favorite movies. I had put off seeing it for a while because I tend to be a bit biased against remakes. But after seeing and liking it, I was eager to see the film it was based on. I don't really know what I expected going in to see the 1960 version, but it definitely wasn't what it turned out to be. Frankly, the remake far surpasses the original. I've talked to some people about it and they have said that it is unfair to compare the two films. If you can't compare an original film to its remake, then there is something seriously wrong.The two films bear little semblance to each other, even in terms of plot. In this movie, the protagonists all conspire to rob five Las Vegas casinos at the same time. Believe it or not, this is far less complicated than the plot of the remake. The idea here is that they cut the power to Vegas, enter the casinos, take the money, and leave. That's it. It's almost an hour before they even start planning the heist, and the sequence itself lasts only about five or ten minutes. Even if the thieves in the remake targeted only one casino, the heist serves as that movie's centerpiece; in the original, it feels like an afterthought. And there's nothing really interesting about how it's done. Some gimmicks are introduced, but they don't play any major role in the long run. For example, the Eleven put infrared paint of some kind around the casinos so they can easily navigate it in the dark. Considering how small the casinos appear to be, it seems like a flashlight would have sufficed.Another problem with hitting five casinos is that the Eleven are split up into five teams. In other words, we don't really get to know them very much. In the remake, every character had some kind of unique personality or ability. In this version, only a handful of the Eleven are memorable in any way. Peter Lawford plays a ne'er-do-well wealthy mama's boy. Richard Conte plays a Walter White-type who wants to provide for his family in the aftermath of his impending death. But that's pretty much it. When the heist is being planned, the arrival of a cowboy named Jackson is made a big deal of. The guy is then completely dropped from the story and makes no further appearances of note. Does anyone honestly remember the nuances of Henry Silva's character? How about Buddy Lester--how did he distinguish himself from the other actors? Characters should be the crux of a film like this--it's kind of implied in the title, after all.The movie is also incredibly dated. Most of the "humor" is years past its sell-by date--kind of like the actors. Most of the actors in this film are in their 40s; by modern standards, they look at least 55. Despite this, they are constantly surrounded by horny women who ogle and suck up to the main cast, something that is only in the movie to show how attractive its main characters supposedly are. Frank Sinatra, who also looks far beyond his 44 years, is cheating on his wife with a dissatisfied mistress. The subplot is only mentioned a couple of times before being quickly discarded; it only seems to exist to show that Ocean is a philanderer and therefore cool by the movie's standards. The portrayal of women in this movie was silly in 1960 and is arguably the funniest thing about it now, even if it's unintentional. Most of the actors aren't given any kind of challenging material, so trying to grade their acting is futile; it doesn't offer anything memorable good or bad. But Akim Tamiroff does have something to work with: he plays the perpetually nervous man organizing the heist. He's probably the worst actor I've ever seen. Maybe he just couldn't work with the script, but he bugs his eyes out at every opportunity and whoops and hollers like a rabid chihuahua at the slightest provocation.By the end of it all I was left wondering what the point had been. A lot of questions remained unanswered. Why did Richard Conte's character die in the middle of the heist after experiencing no symptoms in the few hours prior? What's going to happen between Danny and his wife, especially considering Angie Dickinson is given such high billing? Why did they choose to leave all the money in the garbage, where it could have been found by the police or lost? Why did they hide the money from Santos in the coffin, where it could have easily been discovered by church staff? Why are nubile 20-year-old girls mindlessly throwing themselves at 40+ men, with faces like road maps of Manhattan, within seconds of meeting them? I really wanted to like this movie. The remake is one of my favorites and I was hoping this could match it. It made me realize, however, why remakes should exist: to take sub par movies with interesting premises and make them actually deliver. This is the perfect example of that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty average caper film if not for the Rat Pack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess I should confess at the beginning that I'm an avid Dean Martin fan. But even having said that, this is hardly my favorite Dean Martin film. Oh yes, it's a clever little movie, but to me, the problem with the film is one major flaw -- we're supposed to root for thieves. There are no good guys in this film. They're all crooks. They blow the power going into Las Vegas, depriving everyday people of electricity, some in hospitals, some on oxygen machines, whatever. Yet, again, we are expected to root for them. Sorry, but for me, that's a bit of a problem. If there is one character that you can have a little empathy for, it's Richard Conte's character.Of course, the film also seems very dated today. Not because it's the Rat Pack...they seem almost timeless. But this is the Las Vegas of yesteryear.. Which is okay. It's just dated.And I also dislike the premise of this film -- we're swingers...aren't we just the coolest thing ever? Now I know you're thinking that hey, that guy just doesn't like the Rat Pack. Actually, that's not true. "sergeants 3" is pretty decent. "4 For Texas" is okay. I very much like "Robin &amp; The Seven Hoods".Another problem is that for much of the film, it drags., particularly in the middle of the film.And my final complaint is that much of the film moves kind of slow with too much talk and little action.As to the cast, pretty good. Frank Sinatra is fine here as Danny Ocean, but this is about as far away from his best performances as can be; and I do think that Sinatra was a darned good actor. Dean Martin plays Dean Martin, which is pleasant enough. Sammy Davis, Jr. certainly does better here than he did in "Robin &amp; The Seven Hoods" (where he was little more than a supporting actor); but of course, the Black guy drives the garbage trucks and picks up the stash at the dump). Peter Lawford was quite good as the spoiled rich boy. Richard Conte has the more serious role of a loser who is preparing to die and wants to leave his little boy enough money to go to college. Joey Bishop is interesting in that he plays against character -- a very self-assured cog in the machine. Angie Dickinson is here as the somewhat love interest for Frank Sinatra; not a very impressive role, but she does fine. I always enjoy seeing Cesar Romero. Akim Tamiroff is somewhat interesting as the financial backer of the effort.So, what's interesting about the film? Well, Dino singing the once banned "Ain't That A Kick In The Head". A funny cameo by Red Skelton trying to gamble. And an even funnier cameo of a drunk Shirley MacLaine flirting with Dino. It's also interesting to see a cameo by George Raft.It's a pretty average film that is less than its reputation. But it's worth watching...once...or more if you're a fan of any members of the Rat Pack.Simply because it's a Dean Martin film I recently purchased the Blu-Ray version. It's a very nice transfer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though I had only seen Steven Soderbergh's remake, made shortly after Frank Sinatra died, in the interim I had achieved quite an appreciation of Sinatra's work, first as a game-changing jazz vocalist and, more recently, as an actor. I picked up the 4-pack of both Milestone's original and Soderbergh's trilogy, and, having both dedicated myself to some of Milestone's films and Sinatra's appearances, decided to give the Rat Pack's version a spin. The coolness and fun of the actors rubs off nicely on the proceedings, and it's extremely enjoyable to breathe in. Both Angie Dickinson and Shirley MacLaine are great fun too, as are the Vegas mainstays that make cameos. The extras on my DVD, especially Dickinson and Sinatra talking about making the film, years later when he guest-hosted The Tonight Show, were also splendid and mad my enjoyment even more profound. I highly recommend it to anyone who thinks the remake is great. As fine as a filmmaker as Soderbergh is, it pales in comparison, because as fine as today's stars are, they just aren't The Rat Pack! Also, the ending is one of the greatest. I have always felt that comedy is the hardest genre to do, and it dates so badly, but this holds up quite nicely...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth making the reboot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't blame Steven Soderburgh and company one bit for remaking the story of this crime bunch. The idea is great: rob three Vegas casinos by killing the power of the whole city for a few minutes. However, this original didn't deliver much on the idea outside of bringing together what was apparently the most star-studded cast of the decade. The problem with that is that most of the eleven look too similar to differentiate. At least eight of them wear the same suits and have basically the same hair styles. The only people I could tell apart were Danny Ocean, Josh, the guy who dresses like a cowboy, and sometimes Jimmy Foster. But, I guess that's conformist fifties values for you. The remake in 2001 learned from this by making all of the members of their eleven distinctly different and giving them each a memorable introduction. The story is similar to most crime movies with assembling the team and then getting through the heist, but everything moved pretty slowly. The scenes are long and there isn't that much that happens in most of them. Besides that, there are a some tangent story lines that get a little too much attention. The most prominent of these is Jimmy Foster's relationship with his mother and step-father, followed by Danny's strained relationship with his ex-wife Beatrice. All three of these minor characters got more exposition and attention than many of the eleven, which is kind of a problem considering the size of their roles in the overall plot. We don't actually meet most of the gang until the scene when they all gather around the pool table. This is one of the better scenes in the movie. Then there is the entire third act after the heist that deals with the aftermath of one of the team member's deaths and Jimmy Foster's fifth stepfather trying to catch the team for robbing all the casinos. There is a bit of a twist at the end when the remaining ten discover that all of their money has been cremated and they all walk off regretting the cost of their crime.It could have been much better in a technical sense. The acting was nothing special in any sense even if it wasn't overtly bad. The script was poorly paced, as I've stated before, and didn't give the characters much personality, which was too bad because the actors didn't either. It also spent more time showing what happens within the casino during the robbery than it did showing the actual robbery. I probably don't need to state why this is problematic. Any other problems I might have had with it were a result of late-fifties culture and style. I guess I've made it sound like there is nothing good about the execution, which isn't true. There are certainly things that the director and his crew did right, but it's not more than we've come to expect from any movie. It's like what you would get if you made a cake with slightly but noticeably unbalanced ingredients.If you're a fan of any of the 2000's Ocean movies, know that this is not an older version of the reboot in story or style. The same goes for those who liked this and are considering the reboot trilogy. If you like the "Rat Pack", then I guess this is a good pick, because I can't see many other reasons that people might like it. Overall Rating: 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ocean's 11 (1960): Dir: Lewis Milestone / Cast: Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford, Angie Dickinson: Too many characters introduced too quickly that can likely cause confusion. Setup is inspiring and details a structure regarding eleven men planning and robbing five casinos on New Years Eve. The ending is priceless and director Lewis Milestone does a fine job at keeping viewers interested. However, the cast stumble about with little to do but follow a plan. Frank Sinatra plays Daniel Ocean who heads the scheme while screwing over any chance at true happiness. He is joined by Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford, and a whole slew of others who felt the need to get rich quick. Not one of these individuals come across as anything other than a famous person trying to make this overrated film more important than it is just by having their name stamped on it. It is a well crafted film in terms of production and direction, but too many characters leave for little development. There is a strong theme dealt with rather amusingly regarding how plans can easily go astray and not exactly turn out as hoped. That is perhaps why the ending is the best aspect of the film. That, and it allows viewers to exit this travesty. Production made out better than the role call of actors where it has become apparent that three is no longer a crowd, eleven is.

		<fullReview>The writing and the technical stuff make the 2001 do-over a better and flashier movie to watch, but you can't beat the original for the star quality - Sinatra, Dino, Sammy Jr., Lawford, Bishop, Angie - all the original Rat Packers in full glory. It's an OK movie, but even as a caper flick, the emphasis is more on the real-life camaraderie of the players than on the story itself. My summary line pretty much tells the story; all these guys were in a class by themselves at the top of the heap in Hollywood and the entertainment industry of the era.It was kind of interesting to catch the names of the headliners appearing at the five casinos targeted for the big heist in the story. None of them, except maybe for Danny Thomas and Red Skelton, were as big as the principals in the flick. And since I mention Skelton, his cameo was written very poorly I thought. He was made out to be a boorish dolt and a slug when his real persona was just the opposite. What a wasted moment.Now if you think about the story to any degree, a whole lot of things don't make much sense. How for example, did Dean Martin show up as a lounge act at one of the casinos? That was never explained unless I missed it. The back and forth intrusions by Richard Conte's character into secure areas to rig the wiring at the various showplaces relied on a lot of coincidental timing with his co-conspirators and nothing really ever interrupted his progress. Nothing ever goes that smooth. And then, as far as blowing the whole thing with the money in the coffin gimmick, since when does a coffin get cremated along with the body? If anything, that could have been written with Cesar Romero and the undertaker figuring things out and splitting the big pot between them.But in the end, how much of that really matters? This was the Rat Pack in full battle mode and they pulled it off without really pulling it off. They all had a good time, and probably even a better one off the set while trolling Las Vegas for real between filming. Sammy Davis Jr's. self-effacing comment probably said it best to sum up the feel-good camaraderie between himself and the rest of the Rat Packers - "I knew this color would come in handy some day."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but could have been---</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This original version of OCEANS ELEVEN is good but could have been better. Nice plot, good cast and nice looking "old" Las Vegas are a plus. The caper itself is almost non-existent as not too much time was spent on it. It's after the caper that things get interesting with a nice twist ending.I found it inconceivable that some of the men got jobs in the Casino's within two days of the heist. How did THAT happen? These guys would have had to be checked for security and back ground checks. All this in such a short time? And how could the Dean Martin character get a lounge act job in the same amount of time with no rehearsals yet!! One must really suspend disbelief when watching this movie.The DVD has a nice commentary by Frank Sinatra Jr. and Angie Dickinson who of course have nothing but good things to say about the making and the film itself.The remake was quite different and good/bad in its own way. See them both and compare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vega$ and the Rat Pack, 1960</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love time capsule movies. Something that takes you back to an actual place and time, that is shot on location, not a studio?so you actual feel your you are experiencing a certain time and place, with authentic clothing, hair styles and hearing the colloquialisms used at the time. "Oceans 11" does 2 things well. It takes you back in time to Las Vegas, 1960, that has little resemblance to today's Vegas of monumental skyscraper resorts, owned by multi-national corporations. 1960 Vegas was only about a decade after Bugsy Siegel had his vision of turning the Flamingo Hotel and consequently the LV strip into a vacation mecca for adults to drink, dine, catch top entertainment and above all legally gamble, in comparatively plush surroundings.O-11 also lets you in for a look at the dichotomy of Frank Sinatra's Rat Pack in 1960, when Sinatra was the king of cool and entertainment and the Pack, the Clan, whatever you want to call them, were at their pinnacle and Vegas was their playground, courtesy of the mob, who knew Frank, Dino and Sammy would bring in the high rollers. Less than a decade earlier Sinatra looked like he was washed up. He was having trouble with his voice, MGM dropped him and he had abandoned his wife and 3 kids for Ava Gardner. Sinatra's voice came back and he made some critically acclaimed albums, plus a number of excellent movie roles, displaying his versatility in musicals, comedy and drama. Dean Martin had gotten tired of being Jerry Lewis' straight man and had made a successful transition to a solo act, as had Sammy Davis who had left the Will Mastin Trio earlier in the decade. Peter Lawford had been a contract player at MGM, usually getting a lead in their college musicals. He was dumped by MGM in the early 50's and probably headed to career oblivion until he married into the Kennedy family in 1954. He was no pal of Sinatra's, having been one of Ava Gardner's many lovers. But "brother-in-Lawford" would allow Frank an access to hang out with JFK, who was about to go out on the biggest stage of all in 1960. Which in turn made Lawford a member in highest standing at the time and he may actually have the largest part in O-11.Sinatra is Danny Ocean, who was a Sergeant in the 82nd Airborne. As for the rest of his background, we know he likes to gamble and he likes danger, as we are reminded by Angie Dickinson, playing his estranged wife Bea, "There's only one thing you love, Danny: that's danger. Cliffhanging. You could never love a woman like you love danger." O-11 is loaded with plenty of terrible dialogue, similar to this. Lawford is playing a spoiled rich kid, who was an officer in their unit, although he is clearly subservient to Sinatra's Ocean. Dino is a Vegas lounge singer (he knocks out a great version of "Ain't That Kick In the Head") and Sammy is the world's most talented garbage man. As for the rest of the 11, with the exception of Richard Conte, playing an ex-con who just found out he's terminal with lung cancer ("look Doc, give it to me straight-is it the big casino?") their roles aren't really too important. Although Buddy Lester, playing Vince who is now an MC at a strip club does have an entertaining bit. After we see a rather fleshy stripper named Lolita dancing with a boa constrictor, Vince introduces his wife, another dancer named Honeyface. After Frank and Lawford let Vince in on their plan for the heist, he expresses some concern about the feasibility of it. "Think of me dead." To which Sinatra actually replies -"Oh stop talking like a kid." Indeed, even when Dino expresses concern about how sensible it would be to rob casinos run by the mob (in an era when pit bosses would routinely have card counters hands broken) this is ridiculed by Lawford, "some guys grow old without turning chicken." Of course, eventually everyone is all in on the heist. They pull it off without anyone getting hurt, except for Conte who falls over dead on the strip from a heart attack. And after Frank and Lawford witness this, Frank gives some orders to Lawford, telling him to do this, etc. Peter turns to Dino and says in another bit of unintended bad dialogue "He's taking it very hard." O-11 also has a good bit by Cesar Romero, as Duke Santos, a reformed mobster who is squiring Lawford's rich divorced mother. Duke gets hired by the casinos to recover their stolen loot. There are also cameos by George Raft (who was a close friend of Siegel) Red Skelton (playing a himself] and Shirley McClaine has a cute bit with Dino as a drunk on the town on NY Eve. As for the Rat Pack, who were also doing their act at night while filming in the daytime, they have one thoroughly unfunny scene standing around a pool table that sounds like a routine from their act. Made a famous photo though. In any case, if you can tolerate the silly dialogue, it is fun to revisit the Rat Pack at their peak an era when tobacco was considered a vegetable and a cocktail went with anything at any time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kind of slow but never boring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I admit that this wasn't the fun movie, I expected it to be but it still was a good watch and you of course also need to put it in perspective.Back in 1960 this movie was really something new. You have to give the movie credit for breaking some of early film-making patterns. This movie definitely feels more modern than the usual 1960 production and must also be part of the reason why this movie has become sort of a classic.But really, the movie is not as slick or fast paced as you perhaps would expect. I was actually surprised how long the movie took to set things up. 30 minutes into the movie, it is still busy setting up its characters and the heist hasn't really come into play yet. Not that the movie ever becomes boring, after all there is always something going on but it does let the movie drag at parts and also takes away some of the fun.And it's not like the actual heist is being all that spectacular to watch either. It's fun to see how it plays out but it actually is more fun to see what happens afterward. This was when the movie really started to take off and became a truly good and interesting little crime-comedy.It's all still good to watch. I mean, it's an harmless, enjoyable movie, made for simple entertainment purposes only, that besides got well made and acted out.Frank Sinatra never had been the most impressive actor but he plays simply a good role in this movie! Other well known actors such as Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Angie Dickinson, George Raft and Cesar Romero also show up, as well as Red Skelton in a small and pointless cameo appearance.It's not a smooth, fast paced movie but it still offers plenty of entertainment and therefore also remains perfectly watchable today.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The "Ocean's 11" franchise started in 1960 with Lewis Milestone's "Ocean's 11", a glossy heist thriller which saw a gang of thieves pulling a daring operation in which several Las Vegas casinos are simultaneously robbed. Milestone was a bit of an auteur, known for several fairly good war films, but his "Ocean's 11" remains an anonymously directed affair. Instead, crooner and mega-star Frank Sinatra seems to be the one pulling all the strings, playing the titular role of heist-master Danny Ocean within the film, and the star and money-man calling the shots outside the film. The production was reportedly wrapped around Sinatra's lengthy stays in Las Vegas, where he performed various concerts at up-scale casinos, hotels and theatres.While Milestone's "Ocean's 11" made ridiculous amounts of money back in 1960 ? everyone wanted to see its big name cast: Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr, Peter Lawford and Angie Dickinson ? today it's a hugely dull movie, with large chunks of exposition, unnecessary filler and a heist that's been bettered by countless heist films released both before and after. With notions as to what is and isn't "cool" constantly changing, "Ocean's 11" also looks completely neutered, its "smooth", "relaxed" and "cool" cast now positively lifeless. Half a century later, only Sinatra comes off looking well, though precisely because of him the film plays like one of those bad crime movies by modern African American rappers, designed to show off the star's "riches", "bling", "money", "rule breaking", "flashy accessories" and "bad boy criminality" (Sinatra had close ties with the criminal underworld ? both the Italian mafia and US government). It's a white bread version of such mega-celebrity egotism. Milestone's best scenes? A colourful Saul Bass opening and a wordless ending shot, much imitated by Tarantino, in which our suited gang of heroes walk down a pavement. Everything between these scenes can be missed.Steven Soderbergh would release a remake of "Ocean's 11" in 2001. It's a much better film, featuring a cast of photogenic mega stars (Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Matt Damon, Elliot Gould etc), smooth operators, bad boys and likable character actors. "I owe you for the thing with the guy in the place," is the line which gets the plot rolling, a slice of dialogue which epitomises the film's comically nonchalant attitude. If Milestone's film strove to be cool, Soderbergh goes for a kind of meta-cool, our cast both too cool for cool and playing uncool with coolness, mega stars Brad Pitt always chomping down on food, Matt Damon bumbling with style and George Clooney perpetually basking in his own silly magnificence. As the heist movie is intrinsically formulaic ? first act: assemble the "samurai", second act: plan the heist, third act: escape or get captured ? Soderbergh indulges in a kind of postmodern devil-may-care attitude. Meanwhile, the film's aesthetic is retro cool, with European/French touches, glossy locales, eye popping lights, sparkling surfaces/bulbs, lush cinematography, romantic editing/music, liquidy shapes and a camera that salivates over its suave actors, smooth villains and expensive locales. It's all about the money.Soderbergh describes his "Ocean's 11" as a "big wind up toy", and while its designed to be "just entertainment", it does fit in with a number of the director's "heavier" films ("King of the Hill", "Che", "Traffic", "Eric Brockovich", "The Girlfriend Experience"), which have focused on economic inequality, economic depressions, Marxist revolutionaries and violent corporate muscle. Indeed, the casinos where Soderbergh's heists take place, the Bellagio and several other mega-casinos on the LA Strip, were built in the 1990s by entrepreneurs and corporate raiders like Steve Wynn (the real life model of Benedict, the film's villain, played sexily by Andy Garcia) with junk bonds and help from organised crime lords. With its art galleries and upscale restaurants, the Bellagio was then part of a diversification strategy in LA to earn profits from non-gaming sources. Yet the appeal of all these amenities, like gambling itself, is fuelled by a drive to offer consumers escape from a reality of diminished opportunities for upward mobility (within an American economy of diminishing wages, outsourcing and continuous lay-offs). Within a postindustrial, globalized economy, gambling, and even crime, increasingly appears to offer the best way, in the words of Jackson Lears, "to get ahead in a world where work no longer seems reliable". Indeed, each of the film's robbers comes with some indication that they embody the disaffection created by the increasing division of American society into "haves" and "have nots", whether it be a criminal past, lack of work, or entrapment in a job they find to be unrewarding. Even the bank-roller behind the heist, a former casino owner named Reuben Tishkoff (smoothly played by Elliout Gould), wants revenge against a new economy in which corporate moguls like Benedict can use their financial muscle to push him out. On the flip side, such readings are contradicted by the film's need to work as a big budget wish-fulfilment fantasy, and the fact that the crime genre has always portrayed the criminal as Soderbergh does here: cinema's lovable criminals may live on the outside, but they're still perfect conformists, chasing money in their own way because of capitalism's failings.Soderbergh would release a sequel, "Oceans 12", some years later. This one takes the form of a "con movie", its narrative bending giddily in all directions, mercilessly toying with both convention and audience expectations. The film wasn't well received, despite being as good as its predecessor, which led to Soderbergh releasing the dull, and far safer, "Oceans 13" in 2007. The villain's name is literally "Bank" (Al Pacino) in this outing, but the film is mostly dumb.6/10 ? Some overlooked modern heist films: Mamet's "Heist" and Neil Jordan's "The Good Thief", a remake of Melville's genre defining "Bob The Gambler".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am usually a guy who likes originals to retreads, classic to modern, etc. Yet, the original Ocean's Eleven I think is inferior to the remake of 2001. There, I said it.It has the same flavor of hipness. Perhaps I am too young to appreciate it all. Yes, Sinatra, Dean, Sammy et al. are cool. There just seems to be something lacking here in comparison.No, this was never intended to be a masterpiece. It was the Rat Pack having fun in their playground. It shows. There is singing here, that thankfully the new guys refrained from. I wasn't terribly impressed with the lip syncing.The Red Skelton scene was funny.The heist was and build-up to it was less exciting.Nevertheless, it was fun to see Vegas from 50 years ago. It was different. I always enjoy the vibe of the early 1960s films and that was very much on display here. I am sure in its day, this was cool.Fun for nostalgia's sake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Las Vegas translates as The Meadows, meadows are green, so is all US paper currency and so, it appeared in 1960, was anyone who thought they could hit five Vegas casinos on New Year's Eve and get away with a young fortune.It's true that there have been and probably will be again better heist movies - check Le Cercle Rouge if you don't believe me - but it's equally true that there has never been a better collection of talent than Sinatra, Davis, Martin and Bishop in one movie or a better definition of the word 'cool'. Sinatra and his pals made four movies with numbers in the title, this, the first, and Robin And The Seven Hoods, are light years ahead of the other two, Sergeants Three and Four For Texas but Robin was conceived as a Musical and had a feature-length score whilst this one was conceived as a Ball and played accordingly. I haven't seen and have no desire to see the remake or to engage in ultimately pointless debate on the relative merits of each. Movies began as pure entertainment, nothing more, nothing less, and Ocean's Eleven adheres to that spirit, made to entertain it succeeds well beyond the scope of its conception.</fullReview>

I have always been a fan of the music of the Rat Pack and these guys were the royal spoiled movie stars of their time. Singers are notoriously not very good actors, who cares, the movie is still fun and entertaining. The casinos, the cars, the hair, the clothes, and the strip are awesome. the music in these old movies is a gas too. I love to look back at old Las Vegas. The other comment made about this movie obviously came from someone that does not watch movies today. There are so many steaming piles of cheese put out today, this old one is not. A reminder for those that watch this, is was good enough to be a remake by todays Hollywood spoiled brats, it made them more money than the originals could have ever thought of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sure the critics have their reasons for giving the film four stars, and saying it is underrated (kinf of like Timothy Dalton as James Bond or something), but I can't personally see why to like it all that much. Basically (singers) Frank Sinatra as Danny Ocean and Dean Martin as Sam Harmon along with their old World War II pals plan to rob five of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas in one night, all at midnight. To be honest though, I wasn't paying that much attention to all the film, and the only highlight for me was Dean Martin singing his classic song, "Ain't That a Kick in the Head". Also starring Sammy Davis Jr. as Josh Howard, Peter Lawford as Jimmy Foster, Angie Dickinson as Beatrice Ocean, Richard Conte as Anthony 'Tony' Bergdorf and Batman's Cesar Romero as Duke Santos. I'm sure other people will like this classic version or the two singer stars, but I much prefer the 2001 remake. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well we all know that money is spelled with an "E", But it was truly comedic when Sam Harmon (Dean Martin) had to remind rich boy Lt. James Foster (Peter Lawford). This was truly one of the greatest films I have ever watched. I prefer it over the new version. Any movie with the Rat Pack (Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford, and Joey Bishop) is a outstanding film, but add in actors like Angie Dickenson and Cesar Romero and you have a winner. This movie has comedy, love, adventure, and some of the best music to date! The 11 men involved in this perfect crime are paratroopers from the 82nd airborne that meet together in Beverly Hills, ca. The date is set, on January 1st at exactly midnight one of the power towers is to be blown down to shut out power to five Vegas casinos: Flamingo, Sands, Desert Inn, Riviera, and the Sahara. Sgt. Danny Ocean (Frank Sinatra) presents the map to his troop of paratroopers in a magic trick. All goes smoothly till Tony Bergdorf (Richard Conte) passes away in the middle of crossing the road after all five casinos discover they have been robbed. The deal was that each of the men would have $1,000,000.00 out of this operation. Turns in the end all of the money went to Bergdorf. a great Ending to a fantastic movie, but don't take my word for it. ~Megilina aka Piromedic</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie never attempted to be more than what it was: a chance for the Rat Pack stars to have a party on the screen, and invite their fans to drop in for the antics. Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Peter Lawford all had several good movies of different genres to their credit; this one was just a chance for their fans to see them assembled together. Joey Bishop, Sammy Davis, Jr. and many more of the group's friends join in for this romp around their adopted home, Las Vegas.It was the era of "cool," smoking, fast women, staying up all night, gambling, and drinking booze. It's a story built around showcasing the actors--the characters don't matter. What plot there is entails a bunch of guys setting up a major heist at five Vegas hotels simultaneously (where several cast members regularly performed their famous shows of course). Some "Mission Impossible" type hi-jinx go on, but mostly comical situations confound the operation. There are some interesting twists that affect the outcome that keep the plot interesting. Don't compare this to the George Clooney remake--they're two different ideas, focuses, and results. Only the name was not changed to confuse the innocent moviegoer. The Ratpack was all this original was ever about (note the final visual joke as evidence).Enjoy the nostalgia of a bygone era; it's entertaining in that context. It's a great vehicle to see the talents of some great stars that are no longer with us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take another gander at the dames...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In several ways, not quite what I expected. For one thing, although it's an early example of the comic heist movie, most of the time it never tries be very funny. There are some witty or racy zingers tossed off in the dialogue, but most of the comedy comes from Akim Tamiroff's dyspepsia and befuddlement at the behavior of Danny Ocean (Sinatra), and that element just doesn't work. Red Skelton's cameo is hardly a howler either. Most of the situations and dialogue are surprisingly serious, especially between men and women, and also as the guys look back ruefully on how they haven't made much of their lives since the war.It's been said that women are decorative background characters in a misogynistic film (see the scene of Dean Martin's massage), but what surprised me is how serious most of the "dames" are. They are mostly depicted as the grown-ups to the men's children, not as infantile themselves. (I'm not counting the cameo by Shirley MacLaine, Sinatra &amp; Martin's co-star from "Some Came Running," although she injects that hint of pathos into her patented hooker character.) Angie Dickinson adds nothing to the film's often non-existent plot, but she comes across as a smart, weary woman who's long since given up on Danny and isn't waiting for him any more, in contrast with the bitter Adele character, who resents being dumped by Danny once the good times are over. (Adele is possessive and insecure and resents the fact that Danny expects her to act like an adult who had her eyes open the whole time, and he's dismissive when she doesn't; she's really responding to the contempt with which she thinks he's unceremoniously dumped her, but it's a misunderstanding he doesn't bother to explain. He really hasn't dumped her, she just jumped to the conclusion when she spotted Angie.) Most importantly, Angie and Frank are NOT engineered by the script into re-uniting and you sense that's never in the cards--which is mature for 1960 Hollywood. This also mirrors the situation between Richard Conte's character and the wife who felt compelled to divorce him because she's facing adult responsibilities.The other example is Peter Lawford's mother, a wealthy matron approaching her third marriage. She is not at all a dominating woman, only an accommodating one. He never sees her unless he wants money, and she asks nothing of him. Lawford resents the fact that he lives off her, but that's his decision. When we see her, we like her. She sees her son and her new husband clearly. Her last scene is where she expresses her hurt and disappointment with him over his behavior--and she's right! In other words, she is never some screeching, unflattering mother stereotype.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Summit meeting the way it should be conducted!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ocean's Eleven is not for everyone. There are no big special effects. As far as heist movies go, it's a nice idea, but there are movies that have better and that actually stay focused on the heist. It's still a wonderful movie, though, because it very simply is the best representation of that classic pop culture phenomenon usually called the Rat Pack. If you lived during that time, I don't have to explain that to you. I did not, and I find that many of my generation don't understand what Ocean's Eleven is as a result. Ocean's Eleven is not so much a heist movie as it is a glimpse of the magic chemistry created by the coolest and very talented entertainers of the time. It is also a window on the lives they lived offstage. As those lives were imperfect, so are the characters and story in the movie. We see Frank Sinatra's Danny Ocean with both mistress and wife, all three carrying wounds from the association. It's a true reflection of the time in the attitude that there were the kind of women who were wives, and another kind who were mistresses, and mixing them up was very confusing and heartbreaking to all involved. Whether we agree with that in our modern sensibilities is not the point. It's not as if we've got all the answers when it comes to defining the role of women, anyway. Thus for those used to a traditional romantic story tied up in a bow, Ocean's Eleven doesn't make sense. For anyone who knows that Frank Sinatra had both wives and mistresses, and the story of them had rocked Hollywood and the country for years prior to the making of the movie. I've always been very impressed that Mr. Sinatra was willing to expose himself in such a vulnerable light where we the fans might not think he's perfect. That's what Ocean's Eleven really is. For those of us not privileged to get to see a meeting of the Summit, on the stage in Vegas or in their homes with one another, the movie serves as a glimpse, a fancy kind of home movie. Not that every character is on screen completely what he is off screen. Dean was not so much the womanizing lush you might think if you take the performance literally. Sammy Davis and company say seemingly un-pc things about race that might give one the wrong idea, too, if one does not realize it's a jab at the reality of the times. The portrait of the friendship, the entertainment skill, and many of the personal details are ripped straight from reality, though. Thus I was shocked when whatever creative powers that be made the choice to remake the movie because they could improve on what I read them dismiss as the ridiculous elements of the movie such as the merry band breaking into song during a heist. That's only ridiculous if you take this as a heist movie. Those moments weren't beside the point; they were the point! They show us the magical talent each member of this board brought to the table and give us a hint of the relationships they shared on that high Summit, which aren't so different after all than the human relationships all of us have. Love it or hate it, it is an invaluable reflection of the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ocean's 11 is a surprisingly fun film. It takes its time in developing the plot, but once it's there, it is extremely watchable and interesting, not to mention inspiring (it's hard not to consider knocking off a few casinos after watching Ocean's 11).Sinatra and Martin don't do anything spectacular to re-invent acting, but that's just fine, because they really don't have to. The storyline is peculiar enough and the script is witty enough to keep a viewer interested.If nothing else, this film is worth watching just to see Cesar Romero as something besides the Joker. Not that this makes him any less evil, mind you.If I have one problem with the film, it's buying the fact that these 11 men all managed to be paratroopers. There's not a pound of muscle on anyone besides Dean Martin.So if you can overlook that, it's well worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie, Great Actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now here is 1 great movie with some of the all time best actors. Sinatra, Martin, Davis Jr., Bishop, Lawford, Dickinson, Silva, Conte, Romero. That alone spells success. Throw in a great story line, a great plot, and one of the best ever endings, and you have yourself a great classic.Unlike the remake, Danny Ocean is hired by an ex-convict, who hires his old Air Force buddies to raid Las Vegas. Old Las Vegas. Hit 5 casino's in 3 minutes. How hard is that? Think about it. Even back then it must have been hard. Sinatra, and the rest of the Rat Packers displayed their "Pallie" ways. Only true Sinatra fans can enjoy this movie. I see a lot of people disrespecting this movie. I bet this is the only classic movie they have seen. Technicolor was before the color we have now, just for your information.This movie is one of the best films possibly ever, and I suggest you see it as soon as you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original Ocean's 11!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a doubt, the best film for any ratpack fan! The best of the Vegas jet seters of the 1960's pull off the heist of the century by ripping off the biggest of all rip off artists; Las Vegas. It may pale in comparison to the new Soderberg Ocean's 11 film with George Clooney, but it is the original! If you like this film look into the history of the Rat Pack as they made the film. There are some great stories that only guys like Frank, Dean, Sammy, and Peter could pull off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rat Pack shines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay this movie was no oscar winner. But it was fun to watch. At times this movie seems badly passed. It still shines. The story is about a couple of old buddies from the war. Deside too rob five casinos in Las Vegas led by Frank Sinatra. Half the time while im watching this movie I feel that Frank Sinatra, Peter Lawford, Sammy Davis Jr, and Dean Martin are pretty much playing themselves. E.O. eleven was well sung by Sammy Davis Jr. If you love the remake of Ocean's 11, then check this movie out. The original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terribly Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a film that is supposed to be "Action", this film is really boring. Nothing happens until about halfway through, and even then all that happens is a small punch-up where you can tell they are not really hitting each other and there is no blood or anything so it looks totally unrealistic. It was very '60s and all the characters had the same clothes and looked exactly the same which made it hard to tell them apart. Women were always inferior which I took offence to. Also, the characters said weird things such as "hey-hey!" and "hot damn, howdy!" all of which I found hard to understand. Eventually the film started to reach an end, but it just continued, even after the mission had been successfully accomplished. Basically, at 123 minutes long, the film was far too long. They should have cut out superfluous scenes and edited it better. It did have a funny ending but that completely wrecked the rest of the film and made it pointless. Also the characters promoted promiscuous sex and there was no warning of this on the Australian censorship classification (although there might have been for other countries). A very boring old film, but it's okay to watch if you're a history student.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this subsequent to seeing the George Clooney version, which I enjoyed. The original is nowhere as fast-paced, entertaining, or well-conceived. Highlights do include Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. singing and "authentic" Vegas casino life. It surprised me how much it differed from the remake - almost like two different movies. I gave it a 3; I don't have any desire to see it again - all the same though, I wouldn't leave the room if it were on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oceans 11 could be defined in dictionary-boredom to the max</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Oceans 11 was a bore in the 1960s, and it is boring now. The reason is because the film was just plain boring. Sinatra, Martin, Lawford, Silva, Romero, they've all been in exciting, well made movies-"The Pride and the Passion", "Rough Night in Jericho", "How I Spent my Summer Vacation", But this movie supposedly had a plot about eleven war buddies planning a heist, but nothing makes any sense. A lot of stars parade around and talk, but none of the talk makes any sense. None of the sequences are logical, and it is quite impossible to know what is going on without reading the scenario. The characters all seem to have superiority complexes, and aren't interesting, but then you can say the same for soap operas, and somehow some people can stay awake through them. I haven't seen the remake, but its a good movie to remake, because you can't do any worse than the original. You won't be able to stay awake through this movie. And if you want to torture someone, or get rid of guests, put this movie in the VCR.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First Ocean's Heist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr., and Peter Lawford play former World War II, 82nd Airborne Army paratrooper pals in Lewis Milestone's heist classic "Ocean's Eleven" who knock off the top five casinos in Sin City on New Year's Eve. This elegant, amoral, but indulgent robbery saga spends its first hour assembling the principals and doping out the plan much to the chagrin of criminal mastermind Spyros Acebos. Our heroes concoct an elaborate scheme to rob the Sands, the Riviera, the Sahara, the Desert Inn, and the Flamingo during an electrical blackout after a key transmission tower is blown-up out in the desert. Electronics wizard Richard Conte wires everything so our heroes have an easy go of taking millions. They rely on some pretty sophisticated gear in this early 1960s opus. For example, they mark everything with an infrared spray gun so they know precisely where to go during the blackout. In fact, when they wear special glasses, they can literally see the markings either around the doors or footsteps on the floor to guide them to their destination. Sadly, the Rat Pack never had a chance because Hollywood frowned on thieves enjoying their spoils. Our guys pull off the ultimate heist but they lose the loot in the last scene. Nelson Riddle's orchestral theme music is quite captivating. Red Skelton has an interesting cameo where he plays a player who cannot limit his gambling. George Raft plays one of the casino managers. Cesar Romero is splendid as a calculating character named Duke Santas hired by the casinos to ferret out the robbers. The characters are sketched with enough detail to make them interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Was Fun,Fun,Fun But It Falls Short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ocean's 11 is a heist film starring five Rat Packers: Peter Lawford, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr., and Joey Bishop.The plot is centered on a series of Las Vegas casino robberies.Angie Dickinson,Cesar Romero,Richard Conte,Akim Tamiroff,Henry Silva, Ilka Chase, Norman Fell, Harry Wilson,and Buddy Lester co-stars. Shirley MacLaine, Red Skelton, and George Raft appear in cameos.It was directed by Lewis Milestone.During a Los Angeles Christmas, a group of veterans assembles under the leadership of gambling man Danny Ocean to rip off five Las Vegas casinos just after the stroke of midnight on New Year's Day. Jimmy Foster joins in the scheme because he's sick of needing his oft-married mother's money, especially now that she's about to wed Duke Santos, a self-made man with all sorts of underworld ties. After he receives the news that he could die at any time, newly released convict Anthony Bergdorf reluctantly agrees to participate so he can leave some money to his estranged wife and young son. Ocean's own wife, Beatrice doesn't think much of her husband's promise of a big score to come, but her quiet protests don't dissuade him. With Las Vegas garbage man and fellow vet Josh Howard and several casino employees among their number, the titular band of thieves have just a few days to get ready for their caper. When Duke Santos, Jimmy's mother, and one of Ocean's discarded paramours all show up in Vegas at the same time as the veterans, the crew's perfect plans face some serious hurdles.The movie is dated but still remains fun and watchable.Also,with the iconic status of all ensemble cast involved, the result is disappointing as it does not become a classic.Sinatra, Davis, and Martin performed their club acts at night and worked on this Las Vegas-set film during the day, and the good time they were having fairly jumps is visible to the screen.It was fun,fun,fun but it still falls short.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back when the first of the new Ocean's 11 movies were out, they were showing this on TV and I could not resist in having a look at the original before going to see the new.Despite the slickness of the new one, I much prefer this. It is slower, as people have said but remember this is before the blockbuster (Star Wars and Jaws started that in the 70's) so you have to sort of go with it.Now for the ending, which years after seeing it still has me shaking my head at it's cleverness and simplicity. Putting the money inside the coffin and later finding out that it was cremated, CLASSIC! It's a good thing the last part of the film just has Sammy Davis Jnr. walking along singing to himself as I just couldn't stop laughing.The music is good in this film too, particularly if you like swing like I do. Dean Martin and Sammy Davis sing, but not Sinatra which is a bit of a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film when I was a kid in the late sixties and I thought that it was the coolest thing since slice bread. I watch it now and I cringe at the soft porn, racist, slow moving heart of this picture. This was obviviously a vehicle developed to keep the Rat Pack busy between Vegas gigs and all-night orgies. There are no song and dance numbers in the newer version (I'm not sure if I'm happy or sad about that fact). The war veteran element is missing from the mewer one also. I think this gave the original alot of heart (soldiers using their instincts to make some cash a la Three Kings - another Clooney film) In a sense, it is no different from the newer version. Granted the newer one is more high tech and better acted but it lacks the darkness that the original's ending has. In the 60's crime didin't pay. In the new millenium it does.</fullReview>

It is what it is-time capsule, good time flick, what have you. It is too long, but conversely I would also have liked seeing more of Angie Dickinson and Shirley Maclaine. Have them there in real roles or don't bother. Some of the intro stuff was not needed-maybe more Shirley and Angie instead of the hepcat stuff? It is what it is. I liked the remake better, but this was fun too.**1/2 outta ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very Good, but fun to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has alot of flaws, but it is fun to watch Frank and the Rat Pack have fun with this at the height of their popularity. The plot is a little hard to believe, some of the acting is amusing, some of the dialogue is ridiculous, and what is up with the sound? Some of the noises and talking did not seem to be in sync with what was happening on the screen. That was annoying. I know this movie is woefully dated, but where did they get that Sheriff's Department? This was a bumbling crew that didn't even follow the basics of robbery investigation. How do they let Sammy Davis drive a garbage truck through a police perimeter? Didn't anyone think "Hey, we should look in the truck and see if there is any loot in there, or maybe the perpetrators are trying to sneak out of town in the back". I'm nitpicking here, I know. You're not supposed to look that hard in this movie, I think. It is fun to watch Frank, Dean, Sammy and the boys swagger ultra-cool through this. That's the best part of it. If you're actually looking for a movie with a plot, good dialogue, good acting, you should probably look for something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spirited Time Capsule of a Swinging Style of 48 Years Ago.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah, I know...this film has been made over and then some by George Clooney and his pals into "Ocean's Eleven", "...Twelve", "...Thirteen". All pretty successful films too. And in the forty eight years since the heyday of the "Rat Pack", technological wizardry has improved, so that the story can be made even more fascinating. But we cannot forget that before there was Mr. Clooney and Brad Pitt, there was "the Chairman of the Board" and "Dino" and "Sammy". Sinatra and his pals made this film (the first of several) for the fun of working together, and frequently when they were jointly headlining in Vegas. It is a monument to Sinatra's friendships with the guys who ran those casinos that he was able to get them to cooperate with him on filming this caper.This history lesson is almost finished. It was a period when the public loved movies about complicated and intricate robberies. Think of John Huston's "The Asphalt Jungle". Think of Jules Daissin with "Rififi" and (slightly after this - and also with co-star Akim Tamiroff) "Topkapi". Also the spoofing of Marcello Mastrioni and Vittorio Gassman's "Big Deal on Madonna Street". Also the idea of ex-servicemen turning their military conditioning and expertise into a meticulous criminal enterprise was done in the contemporary 1960 British film (starring Jack Hawkins and Roger Livesey) "The League of Gentlemen". So the genre and its variations were there for anyone to take notice of. Sinatra and Co. just added their cool style to the proceedings.Danny Ocean (Sinatra) has been approached by a wealthy criminal (Tamiroff) to take a plan of his to knock over the five casinos of Las Vegas on the same night (New Years Eve). The plan is foolproof, and requires meticulous timing. It also requires a bunch of men without any criminal records (as the Mob and Police make it clear that known criminals are carefully watched in Vegas). Sinatra, a gambler who likes excitement, does get his old unit (ncluding Martin, Davis, Joey Bishop, Henry Silva, Richard Conte, Norman Fell, and Buddy Lester) together. They were commandos in World War Ii, and worked military miracles together. They also were human enough to wish they could get away with some unauthorized activities (at one point Sinatra and Lester recall when they were on a beach near Oran in North Africa with 6 million in gold bars, but had no shovels available to dig a hole and bury any of it).The plan is to blow up at midnight the power cables to Las Vegas in order to get into the casinos' collection room and collect the millions in them. The rooms will be dark for nearly 15 minutes in their plan, and they will be able to see due to using ultraviolet light paint while wearing special glasses. The circuits in the hotel (which connect to an auxiliary power source) will be tampered with beforehand by Conte, an electronics genius. And the money will be collected from strategic (but uninteresting) spots by Davis with a getaway vehicle.The scheme is pretty good for the film (in reality, the odd comings and goings of Sinatra and his gang would be quickly picked up by the surveillance cameras of the casinos...but then with reality, you have no movie!). Here though there are three problems that may derail the plan:1) Sinatra has been seeing Patrice Wymore, and she is serious about continuing this relationship. But he wants to get back with his estranged wife Angie Dickinson. Wymore threatens to make future trouble, and she notices him in Vegas and decides to do her damage.2) Lawford's mother (Ilka Chase) is about to have her fifth husband, retired gangster Duke Santos (Cesar Romero, in a nice supporting role - you get to like this clever gentleman). Lawford does not like Santos, so the latter is more than interested in Lawford's movements and his friendships.3) Conte does have a police record - he got involved in a burglary insurance swindle. But he's just left prison, and he wants to try to win his family back. But he has learned he is dying of heart disease. Will he be able to complete his vital contribution to the crime?It's a nicely told story, with many bright spots (Red Skelton getting upset about not being properly served in the casino; Shirley Maclaine meeting a chance encounter with a romantic stranger; George Raft trying to coordinate the casino owners to find the thieves). And in a free and easy spirit of that swinging, distant, possibly doomed era. I liked this film...it's as much history and legend now as it was a breezy adventure film in 1960.</fullReview>

The cast also includes Angie Dickinson and several cameos from George Raft and Shirley Maclaine. Nobody has much to do and the first hour of the movie you are basically introduced to the cast. The movie is much better in the second hour when they plan to rob five casinos in Vegas. It's a pretty good movie that didn't deserve a remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The classic 'Rat Pack' flick is surprisingly a very good movie. Dont believe the stuff about it being a vanity project for the leads (Ok maybe it is) but it is a fine and well orchestrated film with colorful and hugely watchable performances all round. Frank and Dean are better actors than they are reputed to be, Sammy's role wasn't too flashy (he plays a garbage man!), Peter was nearly absent and Joey was solid but needed some one liners. The film drags in scenes but shines in others. The films highlight is it's hilarious and unexpected twist-IF YOU DON'T WANT IT RUINED, LOOK AWAY NOW!!!!!-Well, I'll sum it like this-they don't get ANY money in the end! The films twist leads in the opposite direction to the remakes twist (which was also very cool)After watching this, my first thought was 'I WISH THEY DID A SEQUEL'. Oh well, at least Sodenbergh's flick is getting one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scrapes above average! (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS in this review.'Ocean's Eleven' is the first film I've bothered to see with the famous rat-pack in it- Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jnr and Peter Lawford! I wanted to see 'Ocean's Eleven' ever since I heard of the new version being made with Steven Soderbergh at the helm- so I wanted to see the original. The truth is, unless your a huge Sinatra fan, this isn't a very good film! Actually it's just above average!The plot is simple- it's basically a heist movie! Danny Ocean (Frank Sinatra) has to recruit 10 of his ex- WWII platoon men to pull off a heist by robbing five casinos in Las Vegas all at once on New Year's Eve. It's a big job and Danny's employer/idea man needs 11 men who have no criminal records. The thing is, everyone loves Danny Ocean and will practically do anything for him, after all he's got principals yet he's a thief. Nevertheless, I didn't mind that- ex WWII veterans would presumably have a strong bond and Danny Ocean was their leader, and five million dollars may be worth the risk!The problem with 'Ocean's Eleven' is like the style of most films of that era, it consists of a polite protocol and dialogue based narrative to explain the plot. These guys seemed more like playboys rather than ex-WWII vets- especially Danny Ocean! 'Ocean's Eleven' was released in 1960, but it is very much a 50's film in style and structure. Unfortunately, the whole story could've been done in about an hour instead almost 2 hours. There is too much time spent showing how suave, sophisticated and mysterious Danny Ocean- he is essentially an enigma to his wife (Angie Dickenson) in a very pointless scene! And in most scenes he remains calm and cool in his dealings with everyone! Some of the dialogue is very bad and purposeless, especially during the recruiting and planning stages before the heist! Even during the actual pre-robbery set-up where the 11 characters are in the Casinos, every action is paced slowly so therefore it takes ages to get to the actual heist itself! It isn't even suspense-ridden, and I had no idea about a few of the minor characters who were part of this team- because the focus was mainly on Sinatra, Davis Jnr, Lawford and Martin.However, things get more interesting when Caser Romero's character comes into the picture, and the ending was great! The very last shot was extremely cool and the whole way it ended was abrupt and very unexpected! It wasn't like a huge twist or anything but I didn't expect it to end that way, so it wasn't as predictable as I thought! Some of the songs were not bad as well-especially the last song! The camera-work was okay but nothing spectacular, and the charm and appeal of Frank Sinatra was evident in 'Ocean's Eleven', as was his co-stars Sammy Davis Jnr and Dean Martin although each of their characters was slightly annoyingly righteous, polite and trusting for thieves. Red Skeleton has a funny cameo as a gambler. 'Ocean's Eleven', in general, is better than average, although slightly too long, hopefully the re-make will have it's plot totally re-structured to suit a 2001 audience! The original 'Ocean's Eleven' is not bad for an early heist film, it gets a *** out of *****!</fullReview>

His character is nothing short of a mama's boy.Sammy Davis Jr. spends most of the film infatuated with number eleven. He sings about it to his fellow garbage collectors in an annoying number and then belts it out to himself later.

		<shortDescription>Frankie Goes To Las Vegas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The long and constantly-mutating career of Frank Sinatra was entering another new phase in 1960. He was gravitating away from LA and towards Nevada. Ava Gardner was finally behind him, and the Cal-Neva Lodge was the new reality. The 'ratpack' was in place around him, the court of King Frankie. Flashy neon credits at the start of this, the first of the ratpack movies, seem to herald a new decade and a new Sinatra.Lawford, Martin, Davis - the gang's all here, and the blurred boundaries between showbiz and private life seem to have vanished for good. This is the world of martini machismo. Handsome 40-something guys who've been around the block a couple of times wear 'broads' like scarves, and discard them just as easily. Every woman in this film is a pushover, from the miserable wife Bea (Angie Dickinson) to the easy lay Adele (Patrice Wymore). Girls eagerly massage Peter Lawford's shoulders or lounge around the apartment looking silently decorous, until Frank summarily orders them out - the boys have serious business in hand, so 'no dames'. The film cracks some sneering, humourless jokes at women's expense. Frankie reminds the petulant Adele that she was tolerated only so long as she remained sexually interesting. The stripper at which everybody leers turns out to be Vince's wife.Martin's line "Take the vote away from women - make slaves of 'em" is no more than a crude enunciation of the film's undercurrent. The cynical, irreverent Sinatra sets the misogynist tone. Burlesque dancers peel off their clothes to "The Tender Trap", Sinatra's allusion to the female pudendum. As Adele tells Frankie, "You really are a rat".Sketchy and virtually irrelevant, the plot concerns a bunch of paratroopers-turned-playboys who, craving money and thrills, mount simultaneous burglaries of five of Las Vegas' big casinos. The slackness of the plotting is part of the film's relaxed, tongue-in-cheek style as Sinatra and Martin indulge themselves in what is almost a home movie.The 'blocking' of the actors is often clumsy and occasionally looks like an amateur dramatic society's production. That Dean Martin should, within 48 hours of the hatching of the plan, obtain a cabaret spot in one of the target casinos stretches credibility to breaking-point. His three-piece backing combo absurdly produces a big band sound. When Vegas is suddenly deprived of electrical power, Martin's microphone curiously keeps on working.The ratpack are given perfunctory characters ('Danny Ocean', 'Sam Harmon', 'Josh Howard'), but nobody attempts to act. Ol' Blue Eyes doesn't sing at all. Martin breezes through "Ain't Love A Kick In The Head" and the marvellous Sammy Davis knocks out a stylish, swinging "E.O.Eleven". The film is a little too slow and a little too long. Quite why eleven conspirators were needed isn't clear, and the excessive number is cumbersome. This is probably the best of the ratpack films, but that isn't really saying much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent even if it was a vanity project.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something about heist pictures. Nearly all of them are very good and exciting and of all the genres, it's one of the most consistently good. Think about it--with films like "Rififi", "Grand Slam", "The Italian Job", "The Killing" and "Topkapi" it's easy to find a great heist film. Well, despite my trepidation, it turns out that "Ocean's Eleven" is also another dandy heist film. I say trepidation because I always assumed it was just a vanity project--an excuse for Sinatra and his friends to get together and make a film. Well, while this is true, the film also was quite nice--with a dandy script and nice acting all around.The film's title comes from Frank Sinatra's character's name--Danny Ocean. Danny is organizing a bunch of his old war buddies to commit the ultimate robbery--to simultaneously hit the five big casinos in Vegas. The planning is meticulous, the heist comes off without a hitch--but you KNOW with a film like this SOMETHING will go wrong, and by the end, that's exactly what happens. See it for yourself and you'll know what I mean.I really liked the movie. Although this WAS a bunch of friends getting together to make a film, they obviously cared to make a good one. The great twist ending sure helped but it also was nice that they gathered such an amazing ensemble cast. Well worth seeing--particularly so you can hear Sammy Davis deliver the line: "I knew this color would come in handy one day". Watch the film--you'll understand why it's so funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Lewis Milestone's penultimate film. He directed "All Quiet on the Western Front," perhaps the greatest anti-war film ever made, 30 years prior to directing this. While, that film has half a dozen powerful and memorable scenes, this film has none.Still, this film is likable in numerous ways. For example, instead of focusing just on Sinatra and Martin, Milestone divides the screen time pretty evenly, with Richard Conte, Caesar Romero, Sammy Davis and Peter Lawford each getting a few good scenes. This makes it feel very much like an ensemble piece. In fact, Conte is so intense and Romero so relaxed and having fun, that they steal a lot of attention from Sinatra and Martin. Which is not to say that Sinatra and Martin are not good, they're fine. However, neither of them carry the film, but they simply go along with the flow. They often disappear for five and ten minute stretches while other characters develop.The cameos are also fun. Shirley Maclaine, and Red Skeleton appear for a minute or two and light up the screen. Angie Dickenson does a nice ten minute turn as Sinatra's ex-wife.Las Vegas is also nicely highlighted in the film. We get glimpses of the five major casinos of the time. It is amazing how small the city was in 1960. Knocking down a single electrical tower blacks out the entire city and the casinos apparently had a single unguarded wire connecting the lights and vault door.The dialogue is sometimes vapid, but sometimes amusing. At one point, Peter Lawford talks about becoming a foreign ambassador. Sammy Davis makes the sharp observation, "How about to Little Rock". That is where a battle over school desegregation took place in 1956. On the other hand Dean Martin talks about repealing women's right to vote and turning them into slaves. Instead of rebuking him, the other cast members urge him to elaborate on his plan. It shows how chillingly sexist the times were.The ending is easy to guess now, but it is still amusing and clever. I have never been a fan of Nelson Riddle's lush orchestrations. They seem too tame, too "Hollywood Strings" to me. Still, the incidental music is generally appropriate, if unexceptional.That is generally my feeling about the film, unexceptional, but with enough wit and pleasant moments to keep a viewer interested and entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Defines what "cool" was in the early 60's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watch this movie on the big screen when I was young and have watched it several times since on TV. This movie is about the 'Rat Pack" (Sinatra, Dino, Lawford, Sammy and Bishop) and others attempting to rob no less than five casinos in Las Vegas in 1960. These guys are ex Army (82nd Airborne, World War Two) and decide to use their talents in their former skills to knock over five of the major Casinos. There are eleven of these former paratroopers led by Danny Ocean (played by Frank Sinatra-hence the title of the movie-Ocean's 11). Casear Romero has an interesting support role in this film also.As you might speculate (and you would be correct) things don't go quite as planned.Sinatra, Dino, and Sammy are the definition of "cool" (at least as it was defined in the early 1960s). The way that Frank and Dean treat their women is something that probably would not be currently "polically correct" under today's rules.I just relocated to Las Vegas a few months ago and rented the video. It contained special features in which Frank Sinatra JR and/or Angie Dickinson (who had a minor role in this movie) comment on each scene. Sinatra JR not only gave interesting information about some of the scenes and actors, but also how Las Vegas has changed over the years (and not always for the better).I enjoyed this movie, and thought it was very entertaining and highly recommend it.</fullReview>

This is a case where the Ed Wood 'that shot was perfect, next shot' style works. In some parallel universe Sammy, Dean, and the rest were indeed old paratroops who liberated swinging money from hopeless squares. And in that parallel universe, funeral homes cook the lucky stiff at the memorial as part of the show instead of as a plot device.</fullReview>

This movie I thought was going to be the dumbest movie ever, but after watching it for the first time, I found out that since the Production Codes were a lot more strict back in the 1930-1960s that there was only one way to make certain movies. If the other person had taken the time out to read the Production Codes then maybe they could've written something more important instead of wasting their time. I enjoyed this movie, for one, it shows you how times have changed with how movies are made, and for two, it shows you how well the movie was done. Who would've written about eleven guys wanting to rob several Casinos? By watching this movie it gave me a better understanding for why some adults prefer the older movies instead of the newer remakes. This original movie was very good and I really enjoyed watching it. If you don't like older movies then this isn't for you but if you're welling to try it then go for it. As to the other person, you shouldn't write about things that you don't like because someone like me is going to put you down.

		<fullReview>Of course, you'll love it cause you get to see sinatra, Shirley McClain, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr (without the patch), Peter Lawford and that no-talent nudnik, Joey Bishop. Silly plot, unless we really are less naive since 9/11. The security in those Mafia gambling casinos is nilch, and either it was laughable then as well, or we definitely have come far in our suspicion of others and institutional paranoia.Best lines in a poorly-written movie come from the heart, you suspect: Peter Lawford, Pres. Kennedy's brother-in-law, speaks of wanting to go into politics. By buying a senator, they tell him, it will be cheaper and easier. There are similar comments on the corruption of politics and government which in this nightmarish time where the Attorney General is stomping all over the Bill of Rights, the Supreme Court has appointed an illigitimate president, using their powers when the Uncle Tom on the Court should have recused himself for conflict of interest.....etc., etc., is quite refreshing. Refreshing, because we seem to have forgotten that we are a country that is based on the Bill of Rights and the US Constitution, but instead are quite lawless insofar as the leaders of our government are concerned.See it and grieve for a country that once had a conscience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Sinatra is Danny Ocean in the 1960 original. But besides being the mastermind of the heist of the Las Vegas casinos, he really isn't given that much to do. Despite its rather lackluster script and/or dialogue, the film, overall, is very upbeat and fun, giving the viewer the thrill of so many talented and groovy stars in one picture: Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr. some surprise cameos, and a solid supporting cast of non-singers, which include Richard Conte and Cesar Romero. You don't really expect much of real noteworthy acting from such an example of flashy entertainment as this, but it's Cesar Romero, as the movie's "heavy" and a real "Mr. Big", who's got a lot of money, influence and kahunas, blackmailing the guys for his cut, who really stands out among the crowd. With Dean Martin singing "Ain't That a Kick in the Head" and the added plus of Sammy Davis, Jr. performing, this is one film with no thinking involved. Just kick back and enjoy the film with the coolest cats around!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't get the appeal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected this film to have some appeal as a "Rat Pack" flick with all these great legends, but I was quite disappointed overall. The story is a very thin, with these guys somehow knocking off 5 casinos in one night and making it look ridiculously easy. The dialog is full of clichés, the usual references to dames and drink, and even the music is bad. It is not quite jazz, not quite pop, but just a kind of bland Las Vegas mush whose appeal I don't get. Maybe you have to stay up all night drinking and smoking and then it becomes cool. The most incongruous sight is that of Sammy Davis Junior hanging out with his buddies singing the "blues" -- except the music comes off like a number in a Broadway musical. Well, I guess that's show biz. Maybe you had to be there, before the rest of the wild 60s eclipsed Sinatra and this whole Las Vegas genre. I originally caught the tail end of the movie on TV -- there is a twist at the end that intrigued me enough to want to rent the entire DVD. But the earlier scenes don't really live up to the finale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ocean's Eleven (1960) *** (out of 4) Classic film about a playboy (Frank Sinatra) who gathers up ten of his Army buddies to pull a heist in Las Vegas. The plan is to rob five different casinos within the matter of minutes on New Year's Eve. I've been wanting to catch this film for quite sometime and it actually turned out to be just as I expected. I really can't call this a good movie because the story is so incredibly stupid that it's very hard to take anything in it serious but I think that's probably the key to having a good time watching it. The whole plan to rob the casinos is so incredibly dumb that if you did decide to take the film serious then you wouldn't enjoy a thing about it but if you're willing to turn your brain off then you might end up being entertained. There's no suspense to speak of and there's not too much comedy so what does the film have going for it? The cool cast, which is constantly trying to act cool in front of the camera. Not only do we get Sinatra but we've also got Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr., Joey Bishop, Peter Lawford, Cesar Romero, Richard Conte, Henry Silva, Angie Dickinson, Ilka Chase, Buddy Lester and cameo spots by Shirley MacLaine, Red Skelton and George Raft. The wonderful cast really makes this film worth watching and that's really the only thing the movie has going for it. I wouldn't say the direction was overly good but that is mainly due to the screenplay that really doesn't allow anything great to happen. The first hour is a long introduction to all the characters but we really don't learn too much. When the heist finally takes place it's very well handled and fun and I only wish more time could have been spent on it. In the end, this is a nostalgic film that works its magic due to the cast having fun. If you don't take it too serious then you should enjoy it too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Danny Ocean's idea man has come up with an idea ? an audacious robbery that would see a group of men hitting five Las Vegas casinos simultaneously on News Years Eve, making off with millions. With known felons easily identified and removed from Vegas, Ocean gets his old military unit back together in order to ensure clean records and an ability to work to tight schedules. With the gang together, the job is on.A big star-driven piece of its time this film and maybe it does suffer by way of comparison with the modern Ocean's Eleven. The latter was slick, airy and brainless fun that had a great sense of fun in the material as well as having lots of beautiful stars enjoying themselves. The original film is less appealing because it doesn't have this mix and it doesn't all fall into place and click as it should. The thing it does have is lots of stars enjoying themselves. For Sinatra and others it made sense to be able to make a film while also working in Vegas, so it was easy to get lots of big names involved. They do all seem to be enjoying themselves as well, with plenty of charisma and style floating around.This does produce the risk of laziness at times though, which is why it is important that the material is also slick and breezy so that the narrative keeps moving and it never feels like we are watching friends making a movie for their convenience as much as our entertainment. Problem is, the material isn't here. It takes almost an hour before the job is even discussed in a group, with introductions and hanging around filling the time. Even after this the pace doesn't really pick up as there is too much talking (and talking providing little forward motion) and too little action. Even the robbery fails to be exciting and the aftermath is nowhere near as interesting as it should have been.The starry cast is high on quantity but there isn't a huge amount of quality there. Sinatra does a solid lead role; Martin smooches around (but to my mind he hasn't quite got the slick air that Clooney has); Davis Jr gets a song and that's about it. Conte and Romero are both pretty good but after them the rest of the cast are a blur of faces who don't have that much to do (Dickinson, Lester, Lawford etc). Like I said though, the sense of hanging around and having fun with their mates is not transferred to the audience in the way that I thought the remakes did when they were clicking (although O12 didn't really click for me).Overall then, a disappointing star vehicle that is a bit like driving in a Mercedes that someone put wooden, square wheels on ? it looks plush but it clunks forward slowly and a little painfully. Fans of the cast might get something out of it but outside of that it has little to recommend it for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 2001 remake improved on the 1960 original in many ways, but lacked one essential ingredient - The Rat Pack. I wasn't bothered whether George Clooney and co. pulled off the heist or not, but I wanted The Clan to succeed. Sinatra, Martin, Davis Junior, Lawford, Bishop are in sparkling form, and as a result the film is tremendous entertainment. Lewis Milestone knew he wasn't making a masterpiece, but directs briskly and efficiently. There's a fantastic supporting cast including Cesar Romero, Norman Fell, Angie Dickinson, and Richard Conte. Who cares whether the actual heist is exciting or not? Just inhale that wonderful early '60's Las Vegas atmosphere. Nelson Riddle's musical score gives the film drive, and Saul Bass' credits are a masterpiece in themselves. At the last count, I have watched this film 500 times, and the remake only once. I think its fair to say that the original will prove more durable with the passage of time. Even Quentin Tarantino loved it! The best 'Rat Pack' movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original "Ocean's Eleven" is one of those slow-moving films that tries to finish big and does, but by the final act it is hard to care what really happens. Legendary director Lewis Milestone uses a snail's pace to build tension and wonder throughout the film's running time, but the pay-off just is not good enough to raise up the rest of the movie. The film definitely does have a criminal feel with Rat-Packers Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Jr., Dean Martin and Peter Lawford. To be honest the film just never did really engross me and it just seems old and really dated. The remake just puts this version into a lower class of obscurity. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ocean's Eleven is a highly entertaining film with lavish style and the Rat Pack to add to it. The plot is simple and also easy to follow. Basically its just a fancy effort to rob several casino's and run off with the money. Ocean's Eleven gives a very good view of how Vegas was back in those days. There were few casinos and they weren't considered resorts at the time. Vegas was also a place of glamour in those days, today it has been replaced by a family destination with rather lavish, very big hotel/casinos. I first saw this film on TCM (turner classic movies) in widescreen format and I was suprisingly impressed by the performance of the actors and just overal satisfied with the movie and it's on of those films I will watch again. Sinatra who plays Danny Ocean is the head of the gang. With Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr appearing later on.The beginning was a little slow, it took quite awhile for all the characters to come together and unite. I liked Sammy Davis Jr's performance as the fake casino garbage truck driver who is involved with the transportation of the money. He always looked very calm and cool which is the reason why I was impressed. I really liked when he sang the title them e while driving the truck. In one single scene the men all organize in a meeting, then the actual plot occurs. There scheme to rob the casino's was actually not so complicated. I won't discuss how they did it because it would spoil the film. Unfortunely the ending wasn't so good but it still was suprising. The music used in the film often was the Oceans 11 tune and some other instrumental music which changed according to the action. Overall It's a impressive film and very entertaining and different from Vegas films made today.</fullReview>

It helped to give Las Vegas its glamour, and establish the legendary swagger of the Rat Pack. The movie is enjoyable, and makes good use of the wide screen area. This is no movie to watch without letterboxed format! The best sequence is the balloon wipe as the five casinos count down to midnight. No real reason is given as to why Danny Ocean and his partners in crime want to rob five casinos (in contrast to the new remake with George Clooney). Yet you want to see these Robin Hoods pull off their caper. I haven't seen the remake as of this writing, but I'll certainly be in a position to compare the two. For now, content yourself with Frankie's Vegas classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This should have worked a lot better than it did. It combines what sounds like an entertaining enough storyline (a group of 11 ex-military buddies get together to plot a series of casino heists in Las Vegas on New Year's Eve) with a great cast (primarily the 1960's "Rat Pack" - Sinatra, Martin, Davis, Lawford and Bishop) but turns out a plodding movie that never really gets interesting until the last twenty minutes or so - a problem in a 2 hour plus movie.It isn't the cast's fault. Most of the performances were quite good. I thought Frank Sinatra put on a surprisingly low key and subdued performance in the title role of Danny Ocean, the leader of the bunch, which allowed the rest of the cast room to manoeuvre. Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, Jr. were able to perform a few songs in their usual entertaining fashion (Davis playing a singing garbage truck driver!) But the movie was full of lame attempts at humour, and the one character whose purpose seemed to be to provide humour (Acebos, played by Akim Tamiroff) quickly became irritating.What saved the movie from being a complete waste was the last of what were essentially three parts. The first part (the planning of the heist) - which takes up probably 75% of the movie - was really quite dull; the second part (the heist itself) - which is only a few minutes - struck me as unrealistically easy to pull off; but the third part - dealing with the disposition of the loot - saved it all. I had thought of two or three scenarios for what might happen to the money. All were wrong, and what ultimately did happen caused me to laugh at the irony.Overall, it's not a disaster, but it's very disappointing. Why anyone thought to put out a remake of this is beyond me.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, for such a classic film it's amazing how badly so much of it was made. The lighting is atrocious, the acting wooden, the scene structure is like your standard sitcom template, and the editing is childish and uneven. The lighting during the blackout scene, for example, was awful, as was the lighting during the robberies of the actual safes. Someone lights a match and the entire set lights up like daytime. A guy shines a flashlight into a safe and a stage light hits him in the face so brightly that he literally has to squint. Lights were reflecting off of people's faces when it was supposed to be a blackout. Kind of like how in The Great Escape when all the prisoners are crawling out of the tunnel, they're lit so brightly that it's almost impossible to believe that the German guards didn't see them. They might as well have pulled off the escape in the middle of the day. Then again, this was during the time when filmmakers were transitioning away from day-for-night photography and learning how to actually shoot at night. Also consider the scene were the red balloons floated in front of the camera to show the five casinos simultaneously, seconds before the stroke of midnight. Those balloons floating in front of the camera were edited so badly that it's astounding to me that it made it into the final cut like that. Taking five frames off the beginning and end of each clip would have smoothed the sequence out perfectly. Even so, this is an outstanding film, although I have to say it is one of the rare cases where I liked the remake better than the original. It is also one of the rare cases where the extensive changes made in the remake are justified, because Las Vegas was an entirely different world in 2001 from what it was in 1960. You couldn't, for example, go into a casino and start spraying a mysterious substance onto various door handles in plain sight and with wide, swooping arm motions. Security must have been either extremely lax or bordering on incompetent back then, because you wouldn't have even needed surveillance cameras to see what some of these guys were doing. All you would need was to be awake.One thing that I definitely liked better about the original film than the remake, however, was the love story involving Danny Ocean, which was spectacularly botched in the 2001 version of the movie. The difference in the endings of the films is also one of the bigger differences, I tend to prefer the original ending, although I can understand why it was changed for the remake the way it was. How could you make a movie with George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Don Cheadle, and Matt Damon and not design the ending to be conducive to a sequel?If you get this movie on DVD, make sure to check out the Map of Las Vegas videos in the Special Features. There are some cool little short videos about the casinos in the movie in 1960 and the same casinos today, the ones that are still standing, at least. I found it particularly interesting because I took a trip to Las Vegas a couple weeks ago and stayed at the Sahara. It's amazing how much the town has changed. Also, if you look around a bit you'll find a 30 second clip of the destruction of the Sands hotel. Fascinating and heartbreaking at the same time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Were the casino bosses mobsters in the original?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Neither the original or the remake were really worth seeing more than once so I'd suggest renting, not buying. But do see them once. The first part of the original was so boring that I had trouble staying awake, but once the story got going, it was entertaining enough. The "kick in the head" song alone makes the first one worth watching. It could have used some serious editing -- a 50% reduction in the caper planning would be nice and the removal of some of those annoying cameos! The remake is more interesting and more action packed, but the story is still a bit silly. The sequel to the remake -- Oceans 12 -- was dreadful -- don't even bother renting it.The ethics of all of these movies are rather questionable. Is it OK to rob a casino? The best casino heist film I've seen is without a doubt, Lady Killers -- "casino are dens of inequity". To allow for the happy / getting away with crime ending in the remake, the casino boss is depicted as a ruthless man with ties to the mafia. This is particularly manifest in the sequel.Question: In the remake, the casino boss is shown as having mob ties. In the original as far as I recall, there were no hints that the casino owners were crocks. (However the insurance agent was a crock). Can anyone confirm my impression? Perhaps I snoozed and missed something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever and entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as I quite like the remake with George Clooney and co. I have a softer spot for this film. It is a very clever and entertaining film, and also underrated, I know this film has its fans but when it comes to talking of the best caper movies, the 1960 version of Ocean's Eleven is rarely mentioned which I think is a shame as it deserves to be mentioned as such. It may be a tad overlong, but what I love about Ocean's Eleven is its story. It is very sleek and audacious in its structure and entertainment value, and while one might say the ending is derivative in a sense it is also a clever one. The film looks great too, with slick cinematography and interesting sets and locations, and the music fits with the period very nicely. The direction is smart, the script is witty and I think quotable too, the characters have a lot of likability and charm about them and the film is superbly cast with Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra especially impressive and it was really nice to see Angie Dickinson, Peter Lawford, Sammy Davis Jnr and Cesar Romero as well. Overall, a very entertaining movie. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool vs uncool.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cool was The Rat Pack and the era this movie was made, when both men and women dressed up to do the town.Uncool is Julia Roberts.Cool is Las Vegas during it's heyday in the original.Uncool is what this city is turning into (kid friendly).Cool is George Clooney's aunt Rosemary. Uncool is her nephew, George Clooney.Cool would have been to leave this movie alone.Uncool was the above warning not heeded.Cool is not making a sequel to the original. Uncool, again, is not heeding the above warning, by making a sequel of a remake.Cool was Hollywood during this same era. Uncool is Hollywood now, not even bothering to make anything original.Cool was the studio system, flawed but still successful. Uncool is the so-called Independent film groups who realize they still need to make movies with the same money the studios needed. Cool were actors who realized their success was in acting. Uncool are actors who do not realize opening their mouths about anything other than acting and trying to sound intellectual are only displaying their vapid lack of intellect.Cool will forever be the Rat Pack. Uncool will always be today's pretty boy actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull dull dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definitely see the remake--this is a long, dull, unfunny, racist and sexist film. The Rat Pack get together to rob 5 casinos in Las Vegas. That's about it for the plot. Also Angie Dickinson (looking stunning) pops up for a few unnecessary scenes as Sinatra's ex. The script is all talk--it's a full hour before the plot actually starts--the performances are incredibly wooden, the jokes are bad and sick (Dean Martin takes about making women slaves; Sammy Davis Jr is asked "how do you get that black stuff off your face?") and it's just very dull. Davis has one good song at the beginning, the film looks fantastic and there's a great twist ending but that's it. Purportedly, back in 1960, just having that cast together in one film was enough to satisfy some people--who cares about a plot? It was just to see them all look good and act "cool". Over 30 years later though we need something else. This ages VERY badly. Avoid at all costs--a really lousy film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't get but 45 minutes into this sea of sewage before deep six'ing the wreck. More boring, empty dialogue has, to my knowledge, never been written. These guys are going to rob a series of casinos? When? They weren't even into the planning stage when I took to the oars: just walking around smoking, fighting, boozing, sweet talking the ladies, and blathering about the good old Army days. Don't bother dropping anchor in this ocean of rotted seaweed.</fullReview>
