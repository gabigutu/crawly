		<fullReview>Simply put, some movies should never be remade. "Oldboy" serves as a stark reminder with only a few exceptions: Americanized remakes of beloved and admired foreign films inevitably result in disappointment. For viewers unfamiliar with the history behind Spike Lee's "Oldboy," the 2013 film is a remake of the cult-classic 2003 South Korean film of the same name, directed by Chan-wook Park. The Korean masterpiece possess a highly stylized, gritty sensibility while providing an emotional depth to its characters. Iconic director Spike Lee's "Oldboy" is as a handsomely shot piece of genre entertainment, but it fails in its attempt to define itself, resulting into a completely pointless, watered-down underwhelming thriller.An alcoholic whose life is falling apart, Joe (Josh Brolin) is far from the ideal father who is willfully neglecting his three-year-old daughter, Mia. Drugged and kidnapped one night, Joe awakens in a small room with a television, only to learn that he's been framed for the murder of his ex-wife, and will spend the next 20 years trapped in this cell where he is held as a prisoner. During the duration of his imprisonment, he trains his mind and body for escape attempts while pouring his heart out to Mia in letters. After two decades of torment, Joe is suddenly set free, seeking out an old friend Chucky (Michael Imperioli), and meeting Marie (Elizabeth Olsen), an advocate for the homeless who helps him in his cause. Hunting for the individual who locked him away, Joe spares no one as he works his way to Adrian (Sharlto Copley), a deranged man masterminding the mystery Joe and Marie are now determined to solve.Director Spike Lee, working from a screenplay by Mark Protosevich "I Am Legend" (2007), chooses to simply rehash the plot for his American remake, and quickly rushes through the unusual and unique storyline unable to establish an emotional connection with the audience which the original film develops so well. Lee's picture clocks in at a lean 104 minutes, 16 minutes shorter than Park's "Oldboy." As a result, the storytelling is rather straightforward, and it forces Lee to rush through crucial sequences which are not given the adequate time to develop. Subtly goes by the waste side, and almost abandoned completely early into the third act in favor of expeditious explanations.The remake remains largely faithful to the story of the 2003 effort, but seriously lacks in intensity and a sense of meaning. The original film achieves a sublime blending of ultra-violence with extreme art, while the remake feels bogged down in its copycat status, and its overall lighter tone hampers its enigmatic, disconcerting story of revenge. My advice is to avoid this altogether, pull up the original on Netflix, and deal with the subtitles America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a movie but an insult to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THIS WILL BE A SPOILER FREE REVIEW! (Except for the ending, but don't mind, i will warn you) First of all, excuse me for my writing, i'm not a native English speaker.So, i got the "chance" to see the oldboy remake yesterday in a sneak preview. I left the cinema shaking of anger, and i wasn't the only one. Maybe my rating of 1 is a bit to harsh, maybe i would have given it a 3 if i didn't know the original, but i did, and i had to compare the 2. And in that comparison the movie is just an insult.The original was incredible poetic (especially in its visuals and its dialogue)and had an incredible good script. The characters were super plausible and likable. In the remake everything that was special about the original got lost.The poetic overall tone from the original is absolutely lost and got replaced by pure clichés. So there's nothing to win on the aesthetic side The plot twists where also changed from the original, but here is the big problem: They don't work!! The characters are totally unlikeable and their relationship feels so incredible forced and constructed. The final twist is so incredibly dumb because the motivation of the bad guy to do the things he does just doesn't seem to be anywhere near realistic (and is a shame if you know why the original "villain" did the things he does). I will explain this later, but i have to spoil the hell out of it to do so.Another thing that made this movie bad where the action scenes. Some of them were pretty brutal and seemed a bit out of place. But the worst are the scenes that they took from the original (if you know the original i think you can guess which one i mean). I couldn't get rid of the feeling that they wanted to satisfy the fans from the original by "adding" classic scenes, but they just do it way worse. Especially the one legendary scene from the original feels so brutally out of place. They forced it to be there cause they thought it HAD to be there.So, if you don't know the original movie, just go watch this one instead, even as a standalone film oldboy isn't good cause it builds on relationship and charactermotivations that totally felt forced and driven by clichés.If you're a fan of the original avoid this movie at any costs cause it will only make you angry... i even shouted a loud "F*** YOU!!!" to the screen and got applause for it. Trust me, its healthier for your blood pressure to not watch this movie.And now some little extra explanations with BIG SPOILERS!!!He knows about his daughter the whole time!! He sees a TV-show about his case where they interview his daughter, so he knows how she looks. But once he is released they tell him that they captured his daughter so his biggest motivation is to find his daughter (they only tell him if he can explain why they imprisoned him)!! So his major motivation is to find his daughter and not just to solve the puzzle!! Well, not my kind of change (i don't know... it kinda felt pretty cliché the villain really felt like a bad villain, while in the original he was just one mysterious, but kinda human, guy), but okay why not. At least i wanted to know the ending, so there was a reason not to leave the cinema.Now the twist: The TV Show was staged and the woman he fell in love with during his revenge was actually his daughter. Not a bad change, but the real problem is that NO ONE is actually interested in their love! The whole story point that they fell in love with each other was so incredibly bad executed!! It just felt like the biggest cliché of the movie, they absolutely wanted a love story in the movie (cause hey... there must be a love story in every movie, must it?!). But it absolutely doesn't feel real!! So just nobody seemed interested in that plot twist!!! And why did they do this? Cause the whole family of the villain got raped by their father! And Josh Brolin saw how his sister had sex... he didn't even knew that this was her father. He just told a few people that she had sex!! And then the father decided to kill the whole family... WHY?!!! No one knew that it was her father... no one could knew!!! So the villain is not the loving brother from the original, its a sick guy that got raped and now want josh brolin to feel the love he felt!!! REALLY?!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!!!! In the original the whole thing was an incredibly sad story build around a small fault with a big impact the main character did once... And the whole story felt human and realistic! And now we have a dehumanized psychopath with weird motivation that forces us into a final plot twist we are absolutely not interested in!!This is not a remake, this is a disrespecting insult to the original. I hope that people will not associate oldboy with this movie and will instead go watch the original</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though i went in to the movie pretending i was watching an entirely original movie, this remake was awful. The plot was ALMOST the same but he changed things that shouldn't have changed but kept small things exactly the same. The ending was a "fairy tale" type ending to please the audience. SHarlto i usually love his acting but in this movie he was almost like a cartoon character villain. Lee also overemphasizes the blood and gore. The fight scenes almost look all way too choreographed. Overall the plot changed made the movie less believable for me and ending definitely was a way of "satisfying" the audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Woody acting and product placement ruined this movie for me. i'm not sure how he did it, but spike lee even manged to make 20 years in captivity feel rushed and uneventful. to elaborate further, there was ZERO character development, everything felt pushed along, including the 20 years in the room. he was just a pitiful alcoholic for YEARS, then "EPIPHANY", a five minute montage of getting clean and getting in shape annnnd he's out. there was no passion to it, there was no empathy that you get from the original, you don't feel sorry for him. he's just a sociopath on a revenge spree. although, i think the big ending twist was done well, the overall movie was a snooze fest. they even managed to make a pivotal scene, the hallway fight, BORING and pushed along.everything the main character is, is because of that room, his life, his persona, his transformation, and his realizations. it had no heart. the subtlety and nuances of the original are just lacking. like i said, you you don't care about the characters, you're just waiting to see what happens next...and what made it even worse, is that i KNOW what's going to happen next, but dammit, i wanted my money's worth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why would they remake a film by the master? The whole idea behind remaking films is to remake something that was maybe a good idea but had bad execution. The original Oldboy is a 10 top to bottom, story, script, action, actors, direction, why did they try to remake perfection. Josh Brolin is good but when you start comparing him to the pain and anguish Min-Sik Choi convaed in the Korean version there is no way to compare the two. Also I like Spike Lee and some of his work but he was the wrong choice for this. Still not sure who thought this was a good idea, it's like eating a McRib when you can have Korean BBQ, which one sounds better to you. Watch the Korean version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should of been called "How to solve all your problems with Apple products"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Went to see the Oldboy remake last night, although a more apt name would have been "How to solve all your problems with Apple products".Product placement was horrific. He just gets out, doesn't know technology so the female lead was like "ohh we find stuff out on this device called a mac book, let me show you the inner workings of it. Are you getting all this camera and folks at home??" He remembers the restaurant he ate at had a Dragon in the title "Oh we can just use this app here on my iPhone to find all the restaurants in the area with Dragon in it. Are you getting this camera while I go on apple maps and scroll down the list" *camera is over their shoulder showing everything* He knows that song that keeps playing but can't remember where it's from "oh there's an app that lets you play a song and it tells you what it is. Here let me show you and the people at home how to find it on your iphone" *literally holding the phone up to the camera* EVERYTHING they needed to find out, they either ran to a Mac or used their iPhones. Not to mention the 8000 phone calls made each with a lingering shot so you first get the apple on the back and then see the caller picture ID picture then a shot of them swiping to answer it. I honestly half expected him to be swinging a Mac around instead of a hammer in the hallway scene.And Sharlto Copley was just dreadful as the guy who set it all up. Totally hammed it up. His British accent didn't sound cockney like Dick van Dyke but it was as over the top and bad. It was just a sh!t, hugely inferior, dumbed down remake. Meh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neither imaginative enough to stand on its own nor inspired enough as a successful remake, Spike Lee's 'reintepretation' is unlikely to find much of an appreciative audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spike Lee's 'reimagining' of the Park Chan-Wook cult classic 'Oldboy' is a queer creature despite the notable absence of the original's iconic octopus-slurping scene. Those unfamiliar with Park's original, which itself was based on a late 1990s Japanese manga, will likely find it bizarre and even off-putting; and yet those who have seen and loved Park's 2004 Cannes Gran Prix winner are likely to dismiss this as mild and underwhelming compared to the original. But most of all, there is something distinctly Asian in the tale's themes of revenge and solitude that feel an odd and therefore unsatisfying fit for an Americanised "reinterpretation".Yes, to call Lee's version a remake will be ? if you take the filmmaker's words for it ? akin to blasphemy. According to Lee, he and his writer Mark Protosevich had not sought to remake Park's movie; rather, they have returned to the manga by Garon Tsuchiya and Nobuaki Minegishi to shape a similar yet somewhat different story that keeps the essential baroque details intact. And so the setup is the same ? a cold- blooded businessman is drugged and held captive in a windowless hotel room for 20 years, before being let out in a suitcase in the middle of a field.The ever dependable character actor Josh Brolin plays the titular character named Joe Doucett, which we are introduced to as a boozy advertising executive who blows a make-or-break deal by propositioning his client's wife at the very meeting. His sentence for the next two decades while in captivity includes watching a ripped off version of 'America's Most Wanted' where he is held as the prime suspect for his ex-wife's murder, in between being fed the daily news as well as Chinese dumplings. The question upon his release is not who, but why ? as 'District 9's' Sharlto Copley plainly puts to him after revealing himself very early into the movie as Joe's captor ? which forms the core of the mystery behind his unusual circumstance.Joe is aided in his subsequent quest for punishment and redemption by a bartender friend (The Sopranos' Michael Imperioli) as well as a kind- hearted social worker (Elizabeth Olsen). He has a timeline too ? Copley threatens to kill his daughter in the next 48 hours if he fails to figure out his identity as well as the reason for his imprisonment. Neither should be unfamiliar to those who have seen Park's version; indeed, despite what Lee and Protosevich claim, they have only sought to vary the details from their predecessor.So instead of an exercise in dentistry when Joe confronts the caretaker of his prison (Samuel L. Jackson), we are treated to an equally grotesque sequence where he slices bits of skin from off the man's throat. Instead of gobbling an octopus live and whole, Joe merely stares hard at the animal in a restaurant aquarium. And perhaps most significantly, Joe gets to restage the original film's iconic extended sequence where his character takes on an entire army of thugs with no more than a claw hammer and pure rage - a three and a half minute scene rehearsed for six weeks which to Lee's credit, loses none of its predecessor's visceral thrills. Notwithstanding the distinct sense of familiarity with the proceedings, there is just something lost in translation. Park's original was the second and perhaps most famous instalment of his "Vengeance Trilogy" whose exploration of redemption and salvation was firmly set against a unique cultural context; unfortunately, the motivations for Joe's imprisonment lack that dramatic heft when yanked out of that context, especially since the inherent familial concepts make much more sense within an Asian setting. Lee also does himself little favour by undermining an otherwise grim and thoughtful story with cartoonish elements, most notably Jackson's garish performance (complete with blonde ponytail we may add) as Joe's chief jailer turned tormentor.Thankfully, Brolin anchors the titular role with his compelling presence, built on a single-minded embrace of his character's vengeance. His transformation from self-pity to determination is a testament to his prowess as an actor, not to mention his dedication by having gained and then lost a lot of weight. Olsen provides a surprisingly warm emotional centre to the movie, especially in portraying the love angle between her character and Joe - which happens to be one of the ancillary additions Protosevich has brought to this adaptation. Copley is similarly excellent as the demented mastermind behind Joe's depravity, in particular when the two finally confront each other's demons in the operatic climax.Yet call it what you may, but Lee's "reinterpretation" can never quite dissociate itself from Park's festival cult classic. Not only do the key elements remain similar, Lee also retains the iconic touches of the South Korean original. But beyond the graphic brutality, there is just something too culturally specific about the story's twists on revenge and redemption that defy a cross-cultural interpretation. It won't satisfy fans weaned on Park's version, nor for that matter is it likely to win over new converts with its uneven mix of fantasy and stylised naturalism. They'll be baffled, they'll be astonished, but it is unlikely if you are encountering this tale for the first time that you'll be impressed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spike Lee should be ashamed of himself. This movie took an amazing concept, script and an already amazing film, and took a big dump right on top. Not that I'm all that surprised, Spike Lee has been churning out sh*t movies for the last 20 years. As pretentious as this cat speaks, I would hope that he would at least make an interesting movie once a decade. It's been awhile Spike. Just sayin. We all loved the 90s from you homey, but you have been turning dookie out for too long!Go to the original source (goes without saying), and while you're at it, watch all of Park Chan Wook's films, he's an amazing filmmaker, unlike this once original voice turned hack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPOILER ALERT! If you have not seen the original (which I pray that you do) or you want to see the remake then DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With that being said let's get to the point.There is a MAJOR lack of character and plot development in this movie. Major lack of attention to details. Much of the plot is left out.The majority of the plot rested on Joe Doucett in the beginning to make sure everyone knows he is a jerk. Where the original allowed you to actually feel sorry for the main Character, Dae Su this remake does not allow for this. The main character Joe Doucett is an alcoholic bumbling buffoon of a man that does not even have decent street smarts. He manages to get out of the prison and out into the world, But you do not want him to win, you do not like him he is a JERK. This was a major mistake in my opinion. You can't go into the movie hoping the protagonist drops dead.You don't get to the imprisonment until about minutes into the movie. Then you get Josh Brolin's naked booty forced into your face (no it wasn't pretty), and watch him work out for minutes. The infamous fight scene that everyone loves in the original is badly hacked in the remake. Choreography was TERRIBLE, You watch certain people swinging at the air with a bat for 2 minutes before finally getting hit.Also The Antagonist in the original was shown as suave, cool, calm , collected. Very smart and VERY calculating. From the hypnosis to the bug in the shoes, he was everywhere at once and you knew by the end that everything that everyone else did just played into his crafty little hands. In this remake the antagonist comes off as a High Society sniveling snob, who is getting back at Mr. Doucett because his family was ruined.Now for the kicker. In the original the major twist is prolonged at the end. Giving it major emphasis to the point of Dae Su crawling on the ground barking, and begging to be Woo Jin's bitch In the remake they tried to make it a little more twisted. But the delivery was almost comical while the Antagonist, Adrian sniveled about his "Happy family being ruined" The ending is very short and much left to be desired. While the original left you in doubt in the end wondering if Dea su actually still remembers, this remake takes the easy way out.This movie falls WAY short of the original for what I feel is one main reason. The small details. Where the original took time out to tell you things (IE the gas, the School mascot, etc) This remake fails to do any of that hoping that you will catch on. But it was that attention to detail that made the original the classic that it is.At the end of it all I give this movie a 3 out of 10. Unlike other remakes of recent days this movie can't stand up as a remake or on it's own. It is mediocre at best. Wait for it to hit VHS before watching it. (Yes you read that right VHS not DVD) -DediDFDFW</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake that's just about adequate on its own merits, but is hardly a patch on the film on which it was based.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood remakes of Asian films are always an iffy proposition. How will the nuances and culturally-specific references translate across oceans and continents? Generally, however good the remakes, they rarely ? if ever ? eclipse the original films. In recent memory, perhaps only Martin Scorsese's The Departed, based on Infernal Affairs, has managed to find a life of its own. Other remakes, like The Lake House and Shall We Dance?, have sunk into ignominy. Spike Lee's Oldboy isn't completely terrible, but it does lose quite a bit of the dark, bruising, ambivalent flavour of Park Chan-Wook's 2003 Korean classic.Josh Brolin takes centre stage in Lee's version. He sinks credibly into the abrasive, drunken skin of Joe Doucett, a slimy guy whose wife and daughter Mia have left him. Nevertheless, Joe continues to merrily offend everyone around him, until he is abruptly kidnapped and trapped in a hotel room for twenty years. During his arduous time spent in solitary confinement, Joe ponders the mystery of his captor. When he finally gets free, he resolves to seek revenge and re-connect with Mia ? a mission that becomes increasingly fraught with complications as horrifying secrets from his past are unearthed.On its own merits, Oldboy ? the title as obtuse as ever ? is passably gripping. It entertains and horrifies in equal measure, packing in a great deal of bone-crunching violence and torture that runs the gamut from physical to psychological and everything in between. The relationship that develops between Joe and charity worker Marie (Elizabeth Olsen) is well-acted, if a little forced. Lee even cooks up a pretty disturbing face-off between Joe and Chaney (Samuel L. Jackson), the guy in charge of locking up people for his clients ? no questions asked.What works rather less well is the deliberate dilution of the twist in Oldboy's tale, presumably because American audiences can only handle so much moral and emotional ambiguity. Where Park's version sees the revenge mission warped with a horrifyingly emotional dilemma, Lee's film shies away from the conundrum. As a result, the film becomes far less subtle and considerably more melodramatic. There's a flashback sequence towards the end of the film that's ridiculous enough to make audiences laugh rather than gasp, even as blood splatters across walls and families are torn apart.The cast assembled is impressive, even though they're not really given a lot to work with in the frequently stilted, over-blown script. Brolin anchors the film with admirably stony determination, but his Joe never seems to really feel the weight of his twenty years without human contact. Olsen, too, stumbles around a bit, as if never quite sure how to play her part, and Sharlto Copley comes close to overplaying his hand when he emerges from the shadows to drop a few hints about the reasons behind Joe's ordeal.There's enough on display in Oldboy for the film to jog by at a fairly quick clip. Lee pays tribute along the way to a few iconic elements of the Korean film ? an octopus in a tank, a prolonged battle in a corridor ? and the cast tries its hardest to make it all work. But it's hard to shake the feeling that something a little deeper, richer, sadder and weirder was lost in translating the film into a vernacular more pleasing to Hollywood audiences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1993, the alcoholic Joseph "Joe" Doucett (Josh Brolin) is a loathed man with basically one only friend, Chucky (Michael Imperioli), who owns a bar. Joe neglects his three year-old daughter Mia and is estranged of his ex-wife Donna. Out of the blue, Joe is kidnapped and locked alone in a room for twenty years. Along the years, he learns that Donna was brutally murdered and he was accused of the crime and Mia was adopted and raised by a family. Unexpectedly he is released without knowing who arrested him and why. He meets the humanitarian social assistant Marie Sebastian (Elizabeth Olsen) and his old friend Chucky and together they try to find the identity of his kidnapper."Oldboy" is a poor remake directed by Spike Lee of the South Korean masterpiece. It is sad to see Spike Lee so decadent wasting his talent in a garbage like that. I was reluctant to see this remake and unfortunately I spent my Friday night watching this crap instead of watching the South Korean movie again. Spike Lee should do the same. My vote is three.Title (Brazil) : "Oldboy: Dias de Vingança" ("Oldboy: Days of Revenge")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Remake That Will Divide The Audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the original version of "Oldboy" has a perfect 10 out 10, this one has a mixed 6 out 10.At first, I just came back from the theater and I found this movie a very poor remake if I compare it with the excellence, the complexity and power of the Asian film. That film was purely brilliance. So this new version was really promising but had the bar raising too high.From Spike Lee we could expect a truly mesmerizing movie or a very weak one. And in this case I say that this one is not so bad as it looks like here. It's obvious that some people is apparently going too far. It's a disappointing movie, but not a bad movie. It focuses too much in blood and gory instead of the script and the complexity of the characters and situations. The ending can be a bit upsetting for some viewers.Josh Brolin is one of the better things of this version. His performance is as good as he always do his roles. The rest of the cast is between average or good. Nothing remarkable under my watch.So, this "Oldboy" is not a brilliant movie or a powerful remake but it's an entertaining one. It's weird and bloody. Be prepared for that.</fullReview>

F! the only good part was the cute little pet mouse in about 30 seconds of the movie. at one point, Spike lee has his characters allude to the revenge of the classic tale Count of Monte Cristo and its protagonist Edmond Dantes... at that point, i wished I were watching Count of Monte Cristo instead. If you want a tale of murder, seduction, revenge, battles, and a mysterious plot, don't watch this movie. watch monte cristo instead. Oldboy sucked. not a good movie at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entire point of view and concept is changed - invalidating it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The worst thing is reading all the reviews that think the movie is "close" to plot line of original with "slight" changes. What the hell are they talking about? The ENTIRE point of the written piece was REVENGE and INCEST, voluntary and involuntary by entrapment. Violence? just a part of an amazing thriller and stylized. This film has removed more than an octopus and a tongue - it removed the entire foundation of the story. I'm pretty angry actually - if you're going to remake a story, then remake THE STORY. Man locked up for 20 years by fellow student who had incestuous relationship with sister, which was exposed, leading to her suicide and his broken heart, thereby explaining his insane revenge plan. This mess seemed like maybe he copped out because Americans can't handle the real plot without outrage. The ending thereby makes no sense at all given everything else. I will say that the technology in this remake makes it a bit more believable as a story, and I appreciated some plot clarifications that the Korean were hard to understand because of sloppy subtitles. I'm just mad, and disappointed. If you are a fan of original, stay away. If you just want to see these good actors do an OK job of a watered down thriller, it's about a 5.6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly, I wish I could give this movie a zero or less. I have never written a movie review before but the level of disgust and pure ridiculousness of this B movie inspired me. I like both Josh Brolin and Samuel Jackson but I'm guessing only financial gain could have got them to star in this movie after reading a screenplay! The trailer is very intriguing and made me want to see what happens to this poor guy and his beautiful daughter. The actual movie was idiotic. First off, how does an alcoholic loser hustling lecherous salesman that is locked up in a room by himself with very limited TV for 20 years come out on day one a fierce karate expert! Did the only meal he ever receive over and over again of Chinese take out automatically turn him into Bruce Lee? How nonsensical is that? The movie continues into a sick incestual pointless mess. I have never felt so moronic for wasting so much of my time on pure deficiency!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why (re)make this? Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watched an edited theatrical version, in which all nudity and lovemaking sequences are completely chopped, with some/most of the violence as well (specifically, the Sam Jackson torture sequence) and they stand out as obvious gaps over the course of its running length. Though Josh Brolin performs (mostly) well, he also seems to be one of the weakest link here, with expectations from the character both at the beginning and at the end of the movie proving too much for him to handle, and both Lee and he have elected to go for camp on both the occasions, and (I think) it proves to be a major mis-step. His performance in the middle part of the movie though, keeps the movie afloat. Jackson's perfect, Olsen's weak, as is Copley (miscast?) and not for lack of trying. Lee's reverence is in evidence, but this take needed to be something else, since the original pretty much was the definitive version of this Japanese Manga adaptation. Imperioli is also wasted, and that's sad, since it's a strong character otherwise. Quite a comedown for both Lee and Brolin, though I'm sure their future work/collaborations might try to make up for it (Sure hope so). Though I'm sure this one's better than the version that Will Smith and Steven Spielberg were gunning for. I had hopes for this one, but ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Remake Unworthy of Association With The Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this film with the intention of keeping my mind clear and open by judging this movie in and of itself instead of comparing it to the original. That proved undoable. The main question I have is why did they deem it necessary to remake this Korean film? Was it to bring it to a wider American audience? If so they failed. Was it just to make a few bucks? If so, they also failed miserably at that. I think the main problem with this film was that it seemed to have no heart put into the making of it. It looked cheaply made, the actors did not seem invested in their roles and the severity of the circumstances seemed to have little emotional effect on them. They slightly changed the plot in an attempt to make it their own but it was nothing close to an improvement. The action was awful especially the attempt at creating the iconic hammer hallway fight scene. The big twist had little effect on me since I already knew what was coming, but even then it lacked all intensity. And talk about a terrible ending. About the only thing they did well was Doucett's 20 years in confinement. Overall a horrible disrespect to the original film. Not worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>well... Massive disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to know where to start, so maybe let's point out the few pros of the film, before listing the principal flaws... Directing is efficient, the way the characters move through the flashbacks is interesting. Josh Brolin is good, although not exactly at his best. Showing briefly how the world change in 2 decades (the main character not knowing a thing about search engines or apps, and wondering where are public phones and yellow pages books) works fine. Alas, these fews bright spots can't mask the lack of understanding of the original piece, and the general mediocrity of this remake. Every character outside Brolin is almost empty. Elizabeth Olsen should look like a being of pure compassion, not a simpleton who just follows a strange wounded man for no reason. Sam Jackson? well he does a classic sam jackson part, no more, no less... Sharlto copley? OH COME ON!! he can (and has done) so much better than that!! He can be fun, witty, lost, cold, vicious, and here he's just... a parody of an European decadent snob... missing his old days of incest with his sister and father. the story? BLAH. (yes, BLAH.) Seriously, Spike lee either did not understand the korean original, or let the producers wrote whatever they wanted just to cash his check. I mean, how can the Director of inside man, a smart, well thought movie, let this piece of nonsense make it to the screen?? the end is void of meaning, and quite the opposite of the original. And where the gore of the original was used with caution and purpose, blood is here splashed with no reason except maybe getting sure the movie got rated R.The choreography of the fight scenes is a bit more challenging to rate : I'm not sure if the very... well, choreographed, unnatural looks of the fights is a result of poor stunt training and filming, or at the contrary a way to give it a surreal look, since the "hero" learn to fight on TV action flicks... I can give Spike Lee the benefits of doubt on this, he is (or was, maybe) a great director</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>People hate when a classic is remade, but this one is great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oldboy is a remake or reimagination of the 2003 korean movie Oldeuboi. This new version has been badgered by both critics and viewers as a poor, shallow remake, that soils the memory of the original. I disagree. This one was great. The premise is the same as Oldeuboi, a man gets impriosoned for 20 years without knowing why, and when he gets out he seeks out vengeance. But its not that linear. The story is filled with mysteries, and keeps making the viewer asking questions, the same questions as the protagonist, despite him not being the most likable man. Why was he impriosioned, who did it, why was he released? Also the story is dark, twisted and leaves a bad taste in your mouth. A great story, a great mystery. The acting was very good, Josh Brolin does a very nice job, as does Sharlto Copley as the main antagonist. But the movie isn't without flaws. In my opinion the 20 years feel a little bit fast-paced, and don't feel like 20 years but maybe as 20 months. And some product placement was unnecessary. But overall great movie, unworthy of all the hate it has received. On a personal note, I have watched the original, and I liked this one very much. Everyone is comparing this one with the original, and I think that's a mistake. This is a new movie, a new take on the same premise, it has some homages to the original, and that's it. The original was brilliant, but it wasn't without flaw, and neither is this one.If you hate when someone makes a remake of a cult classic you love and you're not open to a new vision on that movie, stay away from this one. If you just love movies, and if you want to watch a great remake, a great reimagination, I think you will enjoy this very much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit, I watched this film with half a mind on the original and hence it should have been doomed before the opening credits had rolled by. Reading various other reviews, the film was never going to be a hit with the so called "connoisieur" However, once I got over my own pomposity, I was pleasantly surprised and, admittedly with a nod to the original, don't think a much better job of a remake could have been managed.The remake is not as good a film as the original. That out of the way - as a stand alone and to the viewer who does not know about the 2003 film, this is very good viewing.The fight scenes were entertaining. Acting good. Good pace. Story good. Basically,nothing bad. I actually thought the photography better than the original. (I also liked the nod to the original's octopus).In summary, if you have seen the original you are always going to be judging one against the other and Korea will win. Also dismiss me as a Philistine but I don't enjoy subtitled movies as much as English speaking ones. I don't have the intellect to understand every (or indeed any) foreign film without having to miss half the cinematography reading.If you haven't seen the original, watch this. It is good. It's just that some critics have got there heads so far up their .............!</fullReview>

I believe due to this and my concise writing style my reviews in the future may be useful and provide some valuable insights.With that said, I am writing this review for one purpose only: IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE ORIGINAL OLDBOY (2003), PLEASE GET A COPY AND WATCH IT FIRST! PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD AND CINEMA, WATCH THE ORIGINAL FIRST!Yes, I am caps-lock yelling at you! This is one of the few times where you would truly lose out on a beautifully tragic experience. This isn't the typical foreign language to English port where some things are lost in translation, yet despite a few missing scenes or poor acting the story is still conveyed. This is practically a complete rework, however, it still manages to (almost) come to the same conclusion. Consequently this ruins any chance you have of watching the original and being able see the story unfold the way it's meant to, because the whole time you know how it will end (even as the other 99% will be new to you).Do yourself a favor and watch the original, it's really worth it this time.</fullReview>

It seemed that the movie was trying to relive Mr. Glass from "Unbreakable" which Mr. Jackson nailed in that movie.The movie does not stand on its own merit. Period. There is NO character growth, most of the action scenes are shoddy at best and all seemed misplaced. The action scenes were simply added to have action scenes.It was still a movie that should have never been made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While you do have "Hammer Time" and a couple of other things that might remind you of the Korean original movie (haven't read the comic the story is based on yet), this is far inferior to it's source film. But it's not Brolins fault, who does a great job to say the least and might be the closest match to any character in the original (though Sam Jackson is always great in any movie he does too). It's not even the fault of Olsen (not one of the twins, the other sister), but there is a very big issue with our main villain.There are things that translate different and a sense of cultural clash, that works better in Korea than it does in America or Europe for that matter. While this is based on a comic book, the original never felt, like it's main villain was a cardboard/comic villain. This one treats him like a fool, which he shouldn't have been. It takes a lot of impact out of the movie and leaves more than a sour taste behind ... a shame, because it did have some interesting updates on the original ... but could never nail it (even more so when you know the "Hammer" scene got cut down, because the studio thought it was too long) ...</fullReview>

The major fight scene seemed comical and Kill Bill gone bad style. Josh Brolin tried to make this another "No Country For Old Men" but miserably failed. The payoff was more than obvious half way through the Flick. Some of his ancient and played out techniques of filming showed up and reminded us of what we fell for in the 80's. I must give him credit for trying to mend a broken train wreck but this was truly a waste of time.once again an American film which considers the audience dumb. The taboo subject tackled in this picture was so overdone that you almost wanted to scream, "Enough already! We catch on!" It seemed that the directors did no research on any of the sensitive matters but tried to make them seem explainable with a few short meaningless lines.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A golden opportunity missed by Spike Lee to silence naysayers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spike Lee's Oldboy is a farcry from Park Chan-wok's original Korean film of the same name, and it's a farcry from a good film in general. The opening title informs us this is a "Spike Lee Film," which should offput any fan or cinephile. In his two decades of filmmaking, Lee has always named his projects "joints" with an opening title card declaring itself "A Spike Lee Joint." The fact that Oldboy is a film and not a joint is offputting because it perhaps states a certain lack of confidence on his behalf. Even in his most professional films (IE: Malcolm X) he would always precede the events with the aforementioned title card.Why Lee would even want to touch the poetic Korean film that has been hailed as a classic is beyond me to begin with, much less his choice to call this an actual film rather than a "joint." The 2003 Korean film has gone on to be dubbed something of a contemporary classic for Korean cinema along with cinema in general. Like all classics, it never needed to be remade for any reason at all (if something is a classic, why the logical reason for a remake anyway if the first one was good enough to even own the title anyway?). It wasn't flawed in any major, corrupting way, it wasn't a story that needed an American twist on it, and it certainly wasn't taken from a relatively unknown film either. Again,. this only leads to questions being asked that I'll presumably never get a straight answer to.There's almost no need to reiterate the storyline for the film because if you're reading a review of the Oldboy remake you likely have seen the original film or, at very least, have a good idea of it. To begin with, very little is changed about the original story. Josh Brolin portrays Joe Doucett this time, however, a morose, alcoholic father who objectifies women, angrily scolds his ex-wife, hates his infant child, and is ungodly arrogant. This is our protagonist, mind you, bearing more than enough characteristics fit for a villain. The original film had more of an anti-hero focus to it, while this one just uses its focus to show a mean-spirited, incorrigible brute with little to no feelings whatsoever.Joe is eventually kidnapped in a drunken-haze and put in a clean-cut hotel room, fed three times a day, and gassed in order to be put to sleep. Through his time in this hotel-room (from 1993 to 2013), he witnesses events that have shaped recent world history, fights fits of rage, learns how to fight with more force and strength, and uses cheap, stereotypical exercise videos featuring voluptuous women as a masturbatory fix.He is released in a large suitcase in the middle of an open field twenty years after being captured with no explanation whatsoever. He has been declared missing for years now, his wife has been murdered and he is the prime suspect, and he no longer has any close friends. Armed with his intelligence and the fighting skills he perfected on the hard walls of his hotel room, he seeks revenge on those who put him away in captivity for twenty years.Let's start with what the Oldboy remake does right (this will go pretty quickly). For one, they took the half-hour Joe spends in captivity and made it an actual grueling experience for the audience too in terms of what we were exposed to and what we had to endure. We feel as trapped as Joe does, and the fact that Lee seems to have focused on this segment of the story longer than Park Chan-wook did for the original film. It may be a comment that will exclude me from the cinephile crowd for a while but I'd argue Lee does the captivity scenes better. Lee seems more concerned with taunting this character while he's in captivity, with the example of Joe befriending a mother mouse who gives birth to several little mice only to have something tragic happen. Lee plays with his sole character during this scene and, in turn, makes it a memorable, affecting experience.Now for the bad (this may take a minute). To begin with, the midsection of the film feels as if it had been heavily rushed into completion, with its timeline jumping all over the place and it never appearing to take time to slow down and develop what it's focusing on. There has been a lot of internal controversy surrounding this remake, be it Spike Lee fighting with the marketing team, or the fact that Lee's original cut was heavily edited down, but regardless, the behind the scenes drama may make the choppiness and easy thing to justify. Furthermore, it comes back down to the unlikable protagonist. Oldboy's original concept was so rooted so much more in seamy yet beautiful cinematography and felt more like a warm and often personal experience of revenge, brutality, and struggle, if that makes even the slightest bit of sense. It had a musicality that couldn't easily be matched. Lee's Oldboy just doesn't do that at all. It's a mediocre stand-alone film because of the aforementioned issues with its pacing and editing, but it's a downright bad film in the regard that its protagonist is a brute and its existence isn't at all necessary. For as much controversy Spike Lee drums up, the Oldboy remake could've been his retaliation in the way of, "I make what I want and I succeed, so deal with me." Instead, it's the equivalent of the art student who dyes his or her hair blue, sits in a corner, and begs "notice me" without ever making or doing anything worth noticing.Starring: Josh Brolin and Elizabeth Olsen. Directed by: Spike Lee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the worst remake I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film doesn't even deserve to be called oldboy. Why is this film so bad? Well many reasons. Firstly whilst watching this film, I simply could not give two shits about any of the characters, none of their characters develop at all throughout the whole film, all are bland and extremely boring. Many people would say not to compare the film, but seriously, cmon,don't compare an oldboy remake to the original one? Ur asking too much. Whilst watching the Korean version of oldboy Oh Dae Sou is seen as this bad ass guy, very happy go lucky and we see his character develop. In the American version Joe Doucette is seen as this guy, who lives on alcohol instead of water for apparently a very long time and once he gets out of his prison, has maybe a page full of dialog. Chucky is a joke of a character and you couldn't care less about his plain, boring death. To be fair, I don't even think the directors cared as we Joe doesn't even react towards his death, in fact he doesn't even find out about it. In the Korean version we have woo-jin Lee, who is one of the best bad guys I've seen in any film, he is evil, pure evil, you hate the bastard but he leaves an impact on you, he is not just an evil person, he has emotion and you can see it throughout the film. So we see woo-jin lee we identify all thats good about his character. Rip them out of his character, and what are we left with? Adrian Price. This guy, oh god this guy is one of the most bland, boring , worst designed bad guys I've seen in any film. They try to make him bad, you can tell how much they are trying to make this guy evil, but he just falls flat on his ass.The characters are just so bland, its almost impossible to feel sympathy for joe as he is just seen as this asshole, and a huge asshole indeed. In fact I almost felt like he deserved what he got. God I felt more sorry for the mice that got killed when he was being held captive.I am not telling anyone to not watch this but please please please don't expect much. And if you are watching this because you can't stand subtitles. Suck it up and watch the Korean version because it is just brilliant, but to be fair, it doesn't take much to be brilliant when there is this piece of crap having the same name as you and is supposedly a remake of one of the best films to date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inferior remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a terrible cash in and miserable remake. It goes through all the same motions, but misses the heart of it. So I'm going to write down what I notice as it comes.Problem 1 (The Protagonist): Joe is scum. Not in a pitiable way, just in a way that makes you want bad things to happen to him. Spike Lee makes him so irredeemable, that I don't care what happens to him for the rest of the movie. Oh Dae-Su was violent and pathetic, but he wasn't a monster. At least, not at first. There's barely any narration. You can't get into his head. Also, when the jock meat head throws a punch without provocation, he almost kills them. He isn't confused and trying to figure things out. He just wants to attack. It occurs to me now why this version is lacking the "laugh and the world laughs with you, cry and you cry alone" part. There's no bend to this character. He's just generic American action vendetta guy. In twenty years, he has a half page of names written single column. A guy like that would have a longer list. He threatens to kill the aid worker. He was going to kill a man in a nursing home with a box cutter. He never even looked up his daughter. This deep in he never even sent anyone to check up on her. I knew the ending was going to have no weight because he actually deserves the worst of it.Problem 2 (The antagonist): Bond villain monologues. It's not quick and clever. It's a freaking dissertation."and die, seconds later, never knowing why". It's terrible, because the curiosity should have been enough after 20 years. He raped Joe's ex-wife, To be the most stereotypical bad guy ever. Also, $25 million, confession, and surrender... because answers wasn't enough. It's all too much exposition and too ham-handed. Random pervy scene with antagonist and minion while watching voyeurism feed. He has an ascot and speaks in a lilt. He blats out 'whore' like a member of the Monty Python show impersonating a nun. So, the father is incestuous, the brother is mad, and his revenge is... that? It makes so much less sense. Why would he use that as punishment? He seems meek, not deep. It's like they made Jim Cummings British to deliver the big reveal. His motivation doesn't work because the situation is totally different than the original. Problem 3 (The Fight): The hallway scene is less brutal and more staged. Panning shots and lit windows ruin the claustrophobic scene that could have been. It was arguably one of the best scenes in the original, and they turned it into a fight scene from Angel but with longer cameras. It also ends with him having a freaking katana, because, you know, source material and all... *sigh* That fight with the minion at the end was completely unnecessary. It lacked all point. The shotgun scene was pointlessly violent, but because there was no emotion to it.Problem 4 (The Plot): You see the person who abducts him. It undercuts everything. They torture him in the room. It's not isolation. It gives him something to rally against. Stupid unsolved mystery bit is further torture for him to see his daughter as cheap motivation. There's Rambo montage music and betterment scene. The ability to escape is not hidden as well. His daughter's picture on a smart phone? This isn't supposed to be a mystery of any sort, is it? Also, the stupid umbrella bit. The umbrella trail is Obvious. Without hypnotism, then she has no motivation to go with him. The sex scene is out of nowhere with no pathos. somehow there are cameras here too at this random place. So he leaves her alone in this hotel room and assumes the bad guy cant find her, despite the bad guy being able to ALWAYS know where they both are? The ending undercuts everything. In the end, his transformation led him to the same conclusion as the antagonist. He is willingly trapped in his own prison. While the original's ending was surreal and a bit of a stretch, it showed that there really is only one way to go, and that's forward. This ending is a savior play. It's self indulgent. It's not driven by conflicting emotions or difficulty reconciling. In the end, he was a bad father and his daughter ended up suffering for it. He could have done something more permanent if he were so inclined to, but no. It's a middle of the road ending on a sub-par remake with an inferior twist.The original is my favorite movie of all time. It's bitter and twisted very human. This was a hack job, borrowing from the original with no understanding of it. Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pale imitation of the original film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2003 Chan-wook Park film is the second in Park's "Revenge trilogy" and also happens to be an adaptation of a 1990's manga(I would advise steering away from this manga though. It's nowhere near as dark as any of these films).When I heard that Spike Lee was directing a remake of one of my favorite films I was actually kind of excited. I was excited because I had the perception that Spike Lee knew what he was doing. I mean, Malcolm X was a pretty good movie after all right?! The original film shocked viewers with a disgusting portrayal of incest, but even then it had a purpose. Spike Lee saw that shock treatment and went "Y'know what, I'm gonna up the ante. I'm gonna go shock the viewers even more than the original". The one difference? The latter film had no purpose whatsoever, thus taking the humanity out of the equation.The 2003 version had a cunning, unusually charming villain with a terrifying cold-hearted bodyguard. The final revelation as to why Woo-jin Lee did what he did actually showed humanity in him. Woo-jin and his sister were perfectly ordinary highschoolers who had secret hidden urges that when acted upon led to horrible consequences. This film took any humanity that they could have possibly had and made their entire family just look like a bunch of monsters.Also, the most interesting thing about Oldboy is the fact that you're essentially rooting for someone who actually caused the death of a loved one and forgot about it as if it was nothing to him. Throughout the entire film he keeps contemplating on if he deserves to live despite all his sins.I normally hate comparing films like this but it was as if Spike Lee asked me to himself. He kept looking at the original and went "Okay, what could I do to make something like this scene, or this scene, or that scene, etc." he insists that the 3 hour version is superior, and possibly even good but I highly doubt that there could be much to improve this film with more time.I would actually not recommend seeing this film, but rather watching the original. I understand a lot of people get bothered by reviews like this but trust me when I say this, it's absolutely worth it. The original Oldboy was made to be enjoyable multiple times because when you find out the true purpose of the villain thus understanding his motives far more clearly for each and every scene he's in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow... rarely does a movie come out that is so terrible that it deserves to be filed in the awful category. Oldboy nails it! I never saw the original but if it's anything like the deplorable and disgusting plot of this one then I'm glad I haven't seen it. What ever happened to having at least a little integrity and moral standard in our entertainment? This movies "twist" in the end is so reprehensible, disgusting, and absolutely unnecessary! Up until the twist, I would've giving this film a 4-5 for its silliness - how can one become a martial arts master by watching cheesy Kung fu movies for twenty years? My recommendation... Not even worth the $1.30 at the Redbox. Certainly not worth your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So Oldboy 2013, the American version. Let me just make things clear. The term "American" does not make this movie a little bit different from the original Korean version, i mean apart from the actors and the language used, everything in the movie is ALL THE SAME!!! What's worse: the fight scene in this movie sucks. Although thank you for not using ridiculous shaky cameras (like the original one), those scenes are seriously hilarious. i can see this guy on the right, having so many chances in attacking Josh from the back, just acting all hyped up dancing around and basically waits for the hero to turn around and punch him in the face. What's worse, the fight scene are almost the mirror movements of the ORIGINAL OLDBOY!!!!!but there's still some brownie points to give. Josh Brolin did a solid performance in this, Sharlto Copley can be better but nonetheless was solid throughout the whole movie, and Samuel L. Jackson is in his key role, playing the big boss with strong ego. All this adds up to a one star rating i gave.for the movie: Directing 0, plot 0, cinematography 0, dialog (absolutely) 0. (You wouldn't expect me to give you credit for what you didn't do, did ye spike lee?) Advice, go see the original Korean version. It darker, had a lot more emotion and the sense of appreciating the original work from the original director Park Chan-wook .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The American remake of the critically acclaimed South Korean 'Oldboy', doesn't quite do the original justice. I am gonna try and delve into some details without spoiling much of the 2013 movies details. I want to first say, when you remake a classic foreign movie, you are either going to get purists hating the movie for taking liberties that don't conform to the original, or you will get people admiring it for unique changes made to the plot. However I stated it doesn't do the original justice, I think they were a little too liberal in making some adjustments to the plot. It just didn't seem as sincere as the original, and came off looking superficially absurd, as if they really wanted to make it somewhat original.The ending is quite elaborate and melodramatic, and it doesn't really follow through on much of the anticipated suspense. They took great liberties in changing the ending, the very end, and you will understand if you see the original. It seemed like the entire movie was trying to be edgy, but at the very end, the writers took a much more conservative move.The acting was not convincing whatsoever, while Brolin played his character well at times, it also seemed very overdone at other moments. Olsen's acting was not anything praise worthy either, see seemed very monotonous and dull. The actors all seemed very flat in dictating emotions. Copley's character seemed so unoriginal, and boring, I found his character the least engaging. He ended up beating a dead horse with his character, strange and overplayed. The other acting was subpar, nothing stuck out, and no impressionable moments.Overall however, if you compare it to the original, it is just plainly terrible. And if you do not compare it to the original, and take it for what it is, it is still just as awful. I am trying not to let the original cloud my judgement of this movie, but it is just an insincere Hollywood drama, looking to cash in on the originals legacy. And even if it was a genuine attempt of a remake, their attempt to spice things up just felt bleak, with moments looking for shock in the viewer, it just felt shallow and rather cheap.So my advice is to watch the movie and think for yourself. But I do believe that it is a terrible movie, with hollow plot twists, insincere acting, poor writing, and many melodramatic moments. So have fun watching it, the first scenes were particularly laughable, the rest just seemed drawn out and bleak. You might even have a better time watching The Purge, because they both seem to be in that cheap Hollywood thriller category, trying to become something that they aren't, and that's original. Thanks for wasting my time Oldboy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sincere effort at mediocrity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw that Spike Lee was going to direct, I thought there was a real possibility that this might be good. My expectations were too high.I've read that there is an extra 40 minutes that were cut out by the producers, and I hope that's true, because given the mediocrity of the film as it stands, it would take at least 40 minutes of very quality film making to redeem it.The remake, while not entirely without merit, tends to highlight the weak points in the story as a whole, but does little to improve upon them. However, Josh Brolin's acting is fairly good, as is Liz Olsen's, but neither character is worth the effort. The rest of the cast just fill the space and do not improve the viewing experience. There seems to be no reason for why any of the characters do the things they do, and the "emotion" generated felt like the blood often sprayed on the walls. It was just there, and it should have mattered, but it didn't.The film becomes almost cheesy at key moments in the story, which have the potential to explore ideas about good and evil, oppression, addiction, income inequality, and vengeance. It picks up slightly with about 25 minutes to go, but then spirals back to the cheesy feel of the rest of it. My final critique is that rather then immersing the viewer in a world of experiential feelings, (which the original does) this takes away the element of having to engage the material and just explains it all away. Part of what made the original great was you had to wrestle with it. I think 5 out of 10 is just about right for this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not seen the original and I only knew the basics of the plot. The film started pretty well and I started to believe in his character and problems. But then as quick as it started he was in his locked cell room. I then sat back and waited to be taken on a long ride that will show the torte over a 20 year period...but it never really did. In fact, the 20 years seemed pretty brief indeed. It was like there was a rush to get to the actions scenes.Before you knew it he was out and about and doing what he does. But nothing felt thought through. His meeting, his investigation, his buddy, his jailer and the cartoon villain. Not to mention the build up to the climax and quite pathetic plot twist. How was this ever going to work when we wasn't given the opportunity to learn about the characters?Overall this is a pretty poor movie. I was left feeling "was that it!?"That said; I like Josh Brolin as an actor and Elizabeth Olsen is really starting to stand out in her performances. But are they worth the watch? Nope, not really. This is just not a very good film.Not recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inferior to the original in every aspect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As is usually the case with remakes, Spike Lee's version of the Korean masterpiece Oldboy is a shallow and uninspired update that feels like a cheapened take on the original. There is very little of the emotional or psychological establishment given to the characters that made the original so fascinating and any of the deep, shocking undertones of the original film are disappointingly toned down and subdued.Josh Brolin, a great actor aside from this film, stars as the drunken and pitiful Joe Ducett, an Americanized version of the original film's Oh Dae-Su. The start of this film follows the set-up the original fairly closely; Joe becomes extremely drunk after forgetting his daughter's birthday and is kidnapped while trying to buy a last-minute present for her. He awakens in a dingy motel-like room where he is held for two decades. Once he is released, he has become a hardened, bloodthirsty warrior driven by revenge against his captors. The main problem with the film's story lies within the narrative. We don't get to hear Joe's thoughts as a narration and his development as a character while in captivity feels forced, unlike the structure of the original film that allows the audience to connect with Oh Dae-Su so well. The film lacks the empathy for the characters that the original contained. Even the antagonist, who was also a fairly relatable character in the original film, feels one-dimensional and bland. What the film also lacks from its superior is the philosophical and metaphorical underpinnings that tied the original's story together. The story of the remake feels rushed and unfocused because of this lack of insight and depth.Overall, the remake of Oldboy does not do justice to its far superior original due to its restrained tone and cheapened feel. Despite a good cast, it is a hollow film, with none of the emotional and psychological aspects that made the original film a masterpiece. To me, this is another example of a foreign classic cheapened by an American film studio.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Josh Brolin is a great actor It takes a terrible script and real effort to make his performance look pitiful and just not believable. If you've seen the original, you'd know that the whole prolonged opening scene was completely unnecessary. It was just Spike Lee's little joke to get a white man pandering to a powerful black man. You'll notice this frequent pattern in Spike Lee films.This time wasting exercise means that the next important scene is terribly rushed and not very effective. It's practically comical.What made the original Asian version work is the great acting, excellent pacing, superb script and on screen chemistry. Nothing here works. Brolin's character is a drunk whose actions are so over the top, that his character just isn't believable.Don't even bother wasting time seeing this dud even if free. Rent the original and you'll appreciate it and thank everyone who told you to do so. This should be rated worse than it is, probably as a result of manipulation of the ratings in an upward direction, believe it or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In all my time since I'm with IMDb I've encountered my fair share of bad movies... I'm not a big fan of Spike Lee, but for some unknown reason I did believe this film might be acceptable. I love the original and I really thought the Hollywood remake might be OK 'cause the actors are actually pretty good. But after seeing this I would like to punch myself for taking the time to watch this piece of garbage. I managed to keep silent even after Twilight and the Hunger Games, but even those crappy movies are acceptable compared to this atrocity. Why would you try to make a remake of an obviously awesome movie???? And why the hell does it have to be Spike Lee, who is only famous 'cause he's racist (yea, black people can be racist too). I would now beg anyone who has seen the original to not watch this movie, but I'm well aware of the fact that those people watch it anyways. To those who haven't seen the original, watch the original and try to forget this remake... If I was a really bad person I'd say that Spike Lee is the black Uwe Boll(sorry Spike Lee, no person on earth should be compared to him...)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is insulting to human intelligence what happens when American cinema takes a foreign gem and vomits all over it.I think last time I saw film this violated was American remake of French movie "13". I like Jason Statham's acting, but that was one movie he could have skipped. Then again maybe he was starving. Poor starving actor who had to set aside morals for few bucks and a crappy role in terrible remake. Give Jason some food, have mercy!Oldboy is a film about revenge and incest. Original Oldboy was a masterpiece. This remake is a pile of defecated vomit. Now, if I did not see the original, it would be 'ok'. But I did.First problem is difference of values between countries that created a movie. I do not wish to ruin watching the original for anyone so I will leave endings out of it. American idea of 'morality' is over the top. Its just far too influenced by extremist Bible thumpers to be anywhere near what it should be.Just go see the original, make up your own mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, excuse me for my writing, i'm not a native English speaker.So, i got the "chance" to see the oldboy remake yesterday in a sneak preview. I left the cinema shaking of anger, and i wasn't the only one. Maybe my rating of 1 is a bit to harsh, maybe i would have given it a 3 if i didn't know the original, but i did, and i had to compare the 2. And in that comparison the movie is just an insult.The original was incredible poetic (especially in its visuals and its dialogue)and had an incredible good script. The characters were super plausible and likable. In the remake everything that was special about the original got lost.The poetic overall tone from the original is absolutely lost and got replaced by pure clichés. So there's nothing to win on the aesthetic side The plot twists where also changed from the original, but here is the big problem: They don't work!! The characters are totally unlikeable and their relationship feels so incredible forced and constructed. The final twist is so incredibly dumb because the motivation of the bad guy to do the things he does just doesn't seem to be anywhere near realistic (and is a shame if you know why the original "villain" did the things he does). I will explain this later, but i have to spoil the hell out of it to do so.Another thing that made this movie bad where the action scenes. Some of them were pretty brutal and seemed a bit out of place. But the worst are the scenes that they took from the original (if you know the original i think you can guess which one i mean). I couldn't get rid of the feeling that they wanted to satisfy the fans from the original by "adding" classic scenes, but they just do it way worse. Especially the one legendary scene from the original feels so brutally out of place. They forced it to be there cause they thought it HAD to be there.So, if you don't know the original movie, just go watch this one instead, even as a standalone film oldboy isn't good cause it builds on relationship and charactermotivations that totally felt forced and driven by clichés.If you're a fan of the original avoid this movie at any costs cause it will only make you angry... i even shouted a loud "F*** YOU!!!" to the screen and got applause for it. Trust me, its healthier for your blood pressure to not watch this movie.And now some little extra explanations with BIG SPOILERS!!! He knows about his daughter the whole time!! He sees a TV-show about his case where they interview his daughter, so he knows how she looks. But once he is released they tell him that they captured his daughter so his biggest motivation is to find his daughter (they only tell him if he can explain why they imprisoned him)!! So his major motivation is to find his daughter and not just to solve the puzzle!! Well, not my kind of change (i don't know... it kinda felt pretty cliché the villain really felt like a bad villain, while in the original he was just one mysterious, but kinda human, guy), but okay why not. At least i wanted to know the ending, so there was a reason not to leave the cinema.Now the twist: The TV Show was staged and the woman he fell in love with during his revenge was actually his daughter. Not a bad change, but the real problem is that NO ONE is actually interested in their love! The whole story point that they fell in love with each other was so incredibly bad executed!! It just felt like the biggest cliché of the movie, they absolutely wanted a love story in the movie (cause hey... there must be a love story in every movie, must it?!). But it absolutely doesn't feel real!! So just nobody seemed interested in that plot twist!!! And why did they do this? Cause the whole family of the villain got raped by their father! And Josh Brolin saw how his sister had sex... he didn't even knew that this was her father. He just told a few people that she had sex!! And then the father decided to kill the whole family... WHY?!!! No one knew that it was her father... no one could knew!!! So the villain is not the loving brother from the original, its a sick guy that got raped and now want josh brolin to feel the love he felt!!! REALLY?!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!!!! In the original the whole thing was an incredibly sad story build around a small fault with a big impact the main character did once... And the whole story felt human and realistic! And now we have a dehumanized psychopath with weird motivation that forces us into a final plot twist we are absolutely not interested in!! This is not a remake, this is a disrespecting insult to the original. I hope that people will not associate oldboy with this movie and will instead go watch the original</fullReview>

I'll be honest: I was not expecting much from this remake, maybe a 6/10 or a 5/10... but c'mon guys...they insulted not only the source material but our intelligence... shame to see so many good actors wasted... it could be a lot better, and I mean, A LOT? better... even with some changes in the plot...

		<fullReview>By the time Josh Brolin's Joe Doucett is released from his bizarre motel room/prison cell after a twenty-year sentence, it's like he was never there at all?How could Spike Lee pull off making so much time behind an iron door, watching television, drinking vodka and eating dumplings, seem prolonged, dire and agonizing using quickly edited montage sequences of Joe donning a Rip Van Winkle beard, watching news footage of various catastrophes and the introduction of three presidents, writing to his daughter and constantly hearing about his wife's murder he was falsely accused of?All the intensive brooding and screaming just isn't convincing enough? This important, pivotal sequence is glossed over like a music video? Even when Joe finds his only friend, in the form of a pregnant mouse, the result occurs so quickly you'll never quite feel the attachment ? what should have been heartbreaking winds up unintentionally hilarious although, later on, an extended fight scene with a stagnant camera pointed straight at Joe, who furiously takes down venomous thugs while an intentionally melodramatic soundtrack blares, is somewhat entertaining...Forced to watch vintage Kung Fu flicks during his incarceration, our hero obviously learned a thing or two? As did the director: Being able to witness gritty action without exploiting a modern in-your-face shaky-cam is a nice change... Meanwhile, during the time after Joe's freed, chasing clues with a beautiful young woman, the mysterious maze becomes a poor man's version of THE GAME but not without a dash of genuine intrigue?That's until the main villain is introduced and fully realized ? a lecturing pill so smug and arrogant you'll wanna mentally fast-forward to the inevitable twist that, in the case of OLDBOY, is more uncomfortable than satisfying? Which can also sum up the entire movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You look at the cast - Samuel L Jackson, Josh Brolin and Sharlto Copley and say "wow, this film has to be at least decent because these guys would never sign onto a project that could be a total dud." This is an example of a one trick pony director (Spike Lee) who built a name around race-based films trying to actually do something other than his usual shtick and having his agents hook these names onto a project which they all probably regret.IMPORTANT: WATCH THE ORIGINAL FIRST. THEN START THIS FILM, WATCH 10 MINUTES AND THEN DECIDE IF YOU REALLY WANT TO TORTURE YOURSELF FOR THE ENTIRE RUNNING TIME.Mistake #1 - You've got to be pretty darn arrogant to think you're going to do at least a good job if not better of remaking one of the greatest original films made. Why would anyone even try remaking Casablanca? The Godfather? Bladerunner? They nailed it perfectly - writing, editing, acting, casting, etc. Chances are you're going to fail.Mistake #2 - Trying to change the story to put your own trademark on your film. I couldn't understand why Spike Lee would bother with his own additions other than to sit back and enjoy seeing the pleasure of his own work where the black man has the upper hand. It's awkward, poorly scripted into the story, poorly acted and blows valuable running time to further Lee's conceit.Mistake #3 - Changing the most important parts of the story to put your own trademark to create a twist which desperately needs chemistry to work but failing miserably to generate it at all. This is a twisted film. The original is done very, very well. I would advise anyone NOT to watch this film and to watch the original so as to enjoy the entire movie and the way the reveals play themselves out. This steaming pile is tossed together with characters that really don't have chemistry and is disturbingly contrived. You will not be able to thank me enough times for telling you NOT TO WATCH THIS FILM AND TO SEE THE ORIGINAL FIRST. You see so many people saying the same thing and there is GOOD REASON for it. Not only will you LOVE the first film's style and execution but you won't be able to sit through the first 15 minutes of this film without being between a laugh and a retch. You will then save 90 minutes of your life. The rating on this film is only in the 5.x grade because Spike Lee clearly had his marketing people stuff the ballot box.WATCH THE ORIGINAL FIRST</fullReview>

The 'baddie', played by Sharlto Copley, displayed some of the worst acting i have ever seen in my life. Seriously...a recently beaten up physics teacher could have given a better performance. The story line is fantastic, which is not surprising considering it was written for another film. This poor remake was a sad attempt to grab at the success of a superior creation. There was a vague attempt at matrix-esque choreographed fight scenes, which were as repetitive as they were cliché. A fantastic performance by Elizabeth Olsen was entirely drowned by the film surrounding her, as her believable acting seemed out of place compared to the farce she was foreground to. Will not watch again.</fullReview>

I did not want to contribute financially to those whose mediocre creative output is merely a bastardised imitation of the living work of true artists. But finally curiosity got the better of me. Such a shame.As a one-time Friday night Hollywood popcorn thriller, it probably just about does the job. But it lacked everything that made the original so great: one of the best opening 20 minutes in cinematic history, a haunting soundtrack, a broken unreliable narrator's sinister musings and aphorisms. Josh Brolin, as much as I usually respect him, in this film was little more than a one-dimensional plank of wood who just happened to talk and wield a hammer; in no way did he even come close to capturing the tortured desperation that Choi Min-sik brought with his role. In the original, even the villain's perverse incestuous love for his dead sister had a deeply human element to it that was able to evoke a well of sympathy from the viewer, no matter how disturbing and repellent we found his emotions. Not for a second did I feel the same pity for his American counterpart. Even Samuel L. Jackson's characteristically brilliant performance could not atone for the film's countless flaws. In short, if you haven't yet seen it, don't bother. How Park Chan-wook agreed to let Spike Lee mutilate his timeless masterpiece like this, just to reach out to the Western audiences who cannot be bothered to read subtitles, is beyond me.</fullReview>

His version of the man who has lost all and wallows in self pity is very believable, but this portrait lasts a minimal first 15 minutes of the film. From the point he is placed in confinement to the end of the film we are witness to a very disjointed telling of a revenge story. Giant leaps in storyline make the viewer fill in the blanks, which is normally a good thing, but in this case it only creates confusion and frustration. This could have been tolerable, but only with a big payoff. The end has a shocker, but it is nowhere close to the payoff for the amount of time and energy invested in this weakly directed and edited version of the original. Just disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't bring myself to watch it all in one go - spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry , I have seen the original and am a great lover of foreign films with these original 100% of the time better than the Hollywood remakes. If you cant watch foreign films this is just about passable.The story line is thin but interesting but as I said I have seen the original and this is where the problem lies.Our bad guy in this almost looks like he tries to come from the most recent Jagaur advert , where all the best villains are British , well this is wrong. In the original the bad guy is cocky but has reason for his action as warped as they may be . In this version we move so far away from the original plot line, which to be honest was the most amazing I have ever watched.They cant even get the imprisonment length of time right, the extremely poor efforts at tension are pathetic, the stupid pathetically weak English accent offers no tension whereas in the original he was emotional , and purred with anger .This film should not have the right in anyway to use the title Oldboy as it bears no resemblance to the great film and original Korean film, who can forget when the realisation kicks in of why he has been released and who everyone is in their roles as you finally unravel it all and become completely entranced by who is who and why the whole chain of events have taken place, to many classic scenes are missing. What can i say , if you haven't seen the original give it a spin , if you have AVOID THIS FILM LIKE THE PLAGUE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unfortunately lackluster remake of a modern masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It should not come to anyone's surprise that Spike Lee's Oldboy was received with predominantly negative reviews. Chan-Wook Park's 2003 original has been a prime example of recent Asian films that have transcended the language barrier to reach both international success and cult-like reverence, leaving many fans critical about the possibility of a Hollywood remake that could do justice to the source material. Whilst the reviews have been harsh, it is not just the scorned fans that are to blame.When Oldboy is taken at face value, momentarily forgetting the masterpiece it adapted, there are several redeeming features that can be pointed out. First and foremost, it is impressive that a film about some of the most silenced taboos of the Western world could be made in the first place. Leaving the plot (and the surprise twists it entails) largely intact might have been necessary to give the film a fighting chance of being accepted, it is bold nonetheless. Furthermore, Josh Brolin portrays Doucett's transformation well, and his believability in both the action and the dramatic sequences is formidable.However, despite the general degree of faithfulness to the original film, Spike Lee felt it necessary to add 20 minutes of extra exposition. This addition has been detrimental of the finished feature. Many lovers of the Korean original would agree that is the ambiguity of the protagonists' and antagonist's morals, memories and actions that resulted in the incredible emotional impact of the film - all of which has been lost in explanation. What we are left with are slight caricatures, all of whom cannot capture the visceral emotions that loaded every scene of the original with a dominant sense of significance.All in all, it is impossible not to conclude that the original has not been surpassed in any significant way.(AREA 555 on Wordpress)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film shot by a person who is... different to us..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It starts amazingly.. really.. quit amazingly.. it is shot well, it is filmed well.. It even sounds great. I like films that can push what people are happy watching. Sometimes I feel i am a little 'out there' and I appreciate films that touch on these raw attitudes because I know I am not alone. It definitely is rather rare opportunity to watch a film that has no boundaries and not worry about society. This film however got it wrong... We are talking about a very sensitive subject talked in a very juvenile way. Shame. I love this sort of film and yet it was ill considered. My experience was shock, enjoyment, then literally snarling to a very false fictional reality... I found it offencive, which for me is a hell of an accomplishment.. I bet I am not alone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A golden opportunity missed by Spike Lee to silence naysayers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spike Lee's Oldboy is a farcry from Park Chan-wok's original Korean film of the same name, and it's a farcry from a good film in general. The opening title informs us this is a "Spike Lee Film," which should offput any fan or cinephile. In his two decades of filmmaking, Lee has always named his projects "joints" with an opening title card declaring itself "A Spike Lee Joint." The fact that Oldboy is a film and not a joint is offputting because it perhaps states a certain lack of confidence on his behalf. Even in his most professional films (IE: Malcolm X) he would always precede the events with the aforementioned title card.Why Lee would even want to touch the poetic Korean film that has been hailed as a classic is beyond me to begin with, much less his choice to call this an actual film rather than a "joint." The 2003 Korean film has gone on to be dubbed something of a contemporary classic for Korean cinema along with cinema in general. Like all classics, it never needed to be remade for any reason at all (if something is a classic, why the logical reason for a remake anyway if the first one was good enough to even own the title anyway?). It wasn't flawed in any major, corrupting way, it wasn't a story that needed an American twist on it, and it certainly wasn't taken from a relatively unknown film either. Again,. this only leads to questions being asked that I'll presumably never get a straight answer to.There's almost no need to reiterate the storyline for the film because if you're reading a review of the Oldboy remake you likely have seen the original film or, at very least, have a good idea of it. To begin with, very little is changed about the original story. Josh Brolin portrays Joe Doucett this time, however, a morose, alcoholic father who objectifies women, angrily scolds his ex-wife, hates his infant child, and is ungodly arrogant. This is our protagonist, mind you, bearing more than enough characteristics fit for a villain. The original film had more of an anti-hero focus to it, while this one just uses its focus to show a mean-spirited, incorrigible brute with little to no feelings whatsoever.Joe is eventually kidnapped in a drunken-haze and put in a clean-cut hotel room, fed three times a day, and gassed in order to be put to sleep. Through his time in this hotel-room (from 1993 to 2013), he witnesses events that have shaped recent world history, fights fits of rage, learns how to fight with more force and strength, and uses cheap, stereotypical exercise videos featuring voluptuous women as a masturbatory fix.He is released in a large suitcase in the middle of an open field twenty years after being captured with no explanation whatsoever. He has been declared missing for years now, his wife has been murdered and he is the prime suspect, and he no longer has any close friends. Armed with his intelligence and the fighting skills he perfected on the hard walls of his hotel room, he seeks revenge on those who put him away in captivity for twenty years.Let's start with what the Oldboy remake does right (this will go pretty quickly). For one, they took the half-hour Joe spends in captivity and made it an actual grueling experience for the audience too in terms of what we were exposed to and what we had to endure. We feel as trapped as Joe does, and the fact that Lee seems to have focused on this segment of the story longer than Park Chan-wook did for the original film. It may be a comment that will exclude me from the cinephile crowd for a while but I'd argue Lee does the captivity scenes better. Lee seems more concerned with taunting this character while he's in captivity, with the example of Joe befriending a mother mouse who gives birth to several little mice only to have something tragic happen. Lee plays with his sole character during this scene and, in turn, makes it a memorable, affecting experience.Now for the bad (this may take a minute). To begin with, the midsection of the film feels as if it had been heavily rushed into completion, with its timeline jumping all over the place and it never appearing to take time to slow down and develop what it's focusing on. There has been a lot of internal controversy surrounding this remake, be it Spike Lee fighting with the marketing team, or the fact that Lee's original cut was heavily edited down, but regardless, the behind the scenes drama may make the choppiness and easy thing to justify. Furthermore, it comes back down to the unlikable protagonist. Oldboy's original concept was so rooted so much more in seamy yet beautiful cinematography and felt more like a warm and often personal experience of revenge, brutality, and struggle, if that makes even the slightest bit of sense. It had a musicality that couldn't easily be matched. Lee's Oldboy just doesn't do that at all. It's a mediocre stand-alone film because of the aforementioned issues with its pacing and editing, but it's a downright bad film in the regard that its protagonist is a brute and its existence isn't at all necessary. For as much controversy Spike Lee drums up, the Oldboy remake could've been his retaliation in the way of, "I make what I want and I succeed, so deal with me." Instead, it's the equivalent of the art student who dyes his or her hair blue, sits in a corner, and begs "notice me" without ever making or doing anything worth noticing.Starring: Josh Brolin and Elizabeth Olsen. Directed by: Spike Lee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why why why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So then 2014 is officially the year of the most atrocious remakes of films that NEVER EVER needed remade(not even when 3d is real 3d in another 20 years or so). The effects of the originals do not look dated yet and neither do the cinematic aspects of the direction or story telling. Stuff like this makes me wish we had never come down from the trees, this would get my vote for worst remake of all time if i had not just suffered the misery of the Robocop 2014.What gets me more than anything is 'they' obviously choose these movies to remake based on how loved they are and how they still they have a massive fanbase with potential to milk us for currency, do 'they' not realise these exact people are those who will be the main audience for these remakes (if there is an audience at all) and because they love the originals so much that if injustice is done outrage ensues? Surely this does not need explained to people spending and chasing the dollars in the movie making circles?!? Surely the idiots putting up the money for this tripe know this, I personally feel i am owed money from the producers of this movie for the entry fee i wasted on cinema tickets and popcorn, lets not get started on my expectations of entertainment and a credible retelling.Because of this movie and Robocop 2014 i will NEVER EVER watch another remake of a movie i had previously enjoyed, be warned Hollywood! I and people like me am your target audience for this drivel as I have paid to watch remakes of almost every movie i ever enjoyed up to this date in my life (i know embarrassing we are as much to blame as everyone involved in the production on some level and i apologise profusely to you all and myself), even the ones like Robocop 2014 which had abysmal reviews before i even had a chance to view it deciding that i will make my own mind up about how bad/good a remake it is, i know i am not alone in my disgust and fury.This type of movie makes me wish i didn't have a pulse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was suspenseful with many unexpected twists and turns in the plot that kept my rapt attention. The ending was to me a surprise. Loved seeing Samuel L. Jackson in it as well as Josh Brolin - two of my favorite actors. To me the movie was strange, different, disturbing, chilling, and nothing I've ever seen before. Just enough violence and romantic tension to keep things interesting. Though I saw a couple of people who reviewed the movie talking about a "remake" if you've never seen whatever the original is and don't know anything about it, then you're seeing it through fresh untainted, unbiased eyes. To me it was fantastic, so good that I'm going to watch it again with my house mates this weekend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore the fact it's a remake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with remakes and especially remakes of iconic films is that they are often up against it before they have even hit the screens. Fans of original franchises do not like classics being tampered with and especially when the original is a stellar offering in the first place and doesn't need a remake. Movies like The Ring, Evil Dead, REC and countless others have all been remade with varying degrees of success but, the one thing all remakes share in common is that they are all judged and summarily dismissed prior to their release in theatres.And therein lies the problem with this film. Existing fans had already convinced themselves it was going to be a crushing disappointment and once that mind-set is cast, no amount of intended impartiality will ever sway that internal opinion. And that's a shame because this film is not that bad and certainly not as bad as the criticism suggests. Yes, it's not as good as the original but, that's because it's not original. Like most I've seen both and whilst the original is excellent, this version is actually quite good. If you've never seen the original and watch this, I highly doubt you'd be disappointed as it moves at a fair pace and still manages to shock at the end. The performances aren't too bad either but then you'd expect that with the cast.In summary, whilst this has been created as a standalone it's still a decent film and stepping back from it, I can't help thinking that had this been 'the original' offering rather than the Korean version, it would have been well received. It honestly isn't that bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No spoilers here.The original oldboy is right up there in my top 5 of all time. It's utterly perfect and gets better with every viewing.So I wasn't in a rush to watch a panned American remake, even if it did have a director and lead actor who I would classify as skilled (Malcolm X is excellent). I was somehow in the mood today so just went for it with an open mind.Turns out the panning was deserved. It's not awful, but it looks so poor when compared to the original.Here's a few things the US movie did worse: - characterisation: we felt no emotional connection with any of the 3 main characters, there was none of the subtle but powerful facial expressionism of the original film. Josh Brolin acts like he's following a textbook, Choi Min-sik acted like he was really experiencing these things. The main female character is blandness personified and the antagonist came right out of the Cliché Baddies Book (for Dummies edition).- Samuel L Jackson playing Samuel L Jackson just takes you right out of the story. His seedy counterpart from the original was much more believable in the same role. Generally the minor characters were far less memorable than the ones in the 2003 film. Mr Han's American replacement is just silly.- the dialogue was cheap. No poetry, no deep metaphor, just a lot of matter-of-factly stating what's happening.- odd pacing doesn't give the viewer any sense of (time)scale. For example: Brolin's character seemed to adapt to seeing real people again instantly.- intimacy scenes didn't feel particularly intimate.- sound mixing was uninspired too. Park utilised similar audio-atmospheres as Tarantino did in that final showdown in Kill Bill 1 (the dripping water tap). Such tricks heighten the senses of the viewer and the action, as its in the silences that a lot of tension builds up. None of that in Spike Lee's effort.- no sign of evocative and earwormy music here, either.- generally no inventiveness or original ideas present.- overall the film is quite boring, to be honest. The original is the very definition of gripping.Any plus points? Well, the famous fight sequence is here and it's done pretty well, certainly more brutal and arguably believable, but lacks the beautifully-understated grunt when the knife is pulled out (one of many memorable little touches the remake doesn't have in its arsenal). Brolin has a magnetic(ish) presence. The production is relatively well-made, but that's small consolation when the overall experience is so flat. Some decent camera work at times, tho' again when compared to Park Chan-wook's effort there's an appreciable difference in artistic ambition. You notice this most during the last 20 minutes or so...worlds apart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flaws from the past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen the original Korean film Oldboy so I am in no position to make a comparison. The Spike Lee remake was critically mauled and flopped at the box office.It is a flawed film but actually better than I expected. Josh Brolin is a boozy advertising executive in 1993 who wakes up imprisoned in a hotel room. He is fed, given Chinese food and basic hygiene. He finds out that he has been framed for his wife's murder and is now a wanted criminal and his daughter been put up for adoption. He has a TV set and goes through various events such as the Clinton Presidency, Bush Jr, 9/11, New Orleans floods, Obama and is released 20 years later and goes down to track the person who incarcerated him and why. Even after his release it looks like his captors are controlling his destiny.Brolin in the early scenes looks terrible. I think he had a bad wig and he looks in his 50s. These are the scenes set in 1993 when he is supposed to be in his 20s.The scenes in the hotel room are suitably grim and Lee adds some surreal touches to it. After 20 years and when Brolin decides to shape up in the hotel, we have some bloody fight scenes. However these sequences lack the balletic fight movements that Far East cinema is known for and Brolin is not a natural martial arts star.However the film moves along swiftly and we the audience are intrigued as Brolin discovers the people running the hotel and the mysterious man who has directed events for the last 20 years who has a vendetta against Brolin.Elizabeth Olsen is good as the nurse who helps him after his release and Brolin looks more suited for the scenes set 20 years later than the early part of the film.The biggest flaw is I think Lee needed to maybe bring more of his own vision in the film rather than transplant a Korean film in the USA with I believe minor changes. You also need to hold too much suspension of disbelief that the villain is still watching and controlling Brolin's destiny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It had a lot of twists and turns and there were many different locations used in the filming of it. I am a huge Josh Brolin fan, as he is a great actor, but unfortunately I'm not too big of a fan for this movie itself. This film lacked action. there was little fighting and I thought that was the main idea of old; fighting. The villain in this film is a cheesy man with a troubled past. a man who can't let go of something that happened in high school. The villain is very immature.**spoiler ahead** The worst part about it all is that the main character is tricked by the villain into having sex with his own daughter.... and believe it or not it is a very sexy scene, as the viewer is unaware of the father, daughter relationship between the couple at the time. Elisabeth Olsen is the girl that "oldboy" falls for. She's young and beautiful. She is half his age so even if she weren't his daughter, it'd still be quite awkward for the viewer to see. Olsen is clearly obsessed with oldboy but she is probably only attracted to his need for help. It's a kinda stupid movie. Not exactly pointless, but definitely not an important one either. I guess see it if you stumble into it. But don't buy it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's get this straight: I'm open minded to remakes. I don't think it's a blasphemy. And there are cases when I prefer remakes compared to the original. Shortly that's not the case here.I'll be fair: this is not a very bad movie as a standalone. But if you remake a cult classic comparison is unavoidable. And compared to the original this movie does not deliver. I think what is written at the trivia section must be true. There should be a longer original version because Spike Lee is better than this. I have to think the studio killed the movie on the cutting table. I can only hope one day they'll release the director's cut which may do justice to the director's original vision. I believe the missing 40 minutes may save the movie.The remake as others stated is way too quick. We are rushing trough the plot. It's cut like an action movie but this should be drama. Drama on both sides. And that's where the movie really fails: the original is heartbreaking! And it is so well written and directed that you feel endless regret and sympathy for both sides. It's a nightmarish catch 22 all the way.And that's what missing from the Spike Lee version. You don't really care for neither of the sides. It tries to get you involved but it does not really work: you don't really like the good guy because he is a prick but you really hate the other because that's a lunatic. The plot twist is simply grotesque in the remake. I think they missed the point here greatly: in the original it's not the twist what is shocking but the reactions. In the original they are all human. With all their problems. With all their passion and heart. They are well built characters while only marionette figures in the remake.I don't mind they changed the plot at some points. It wouldn't matter. It's a remake not a copy. But it should work, and it does not. To be fair I re-watched the original after watching the remake. I would say they are not even on the same level. The original is an all time masterpiece while the remake is average Hollywood craftsmanship unfortunately.Josh Brolin is the best thing in the movie. It is not his fault. He tried. The homages are kind ideas from the director: using the same solution for the memory scenes worked great, however the corridor fight scene was too much for me. The original was believable but the remake is only extra violent with CGI blood spraying everywhere while dead people fly around with smashed skulls pointlessly.I was looking forward to this remake for years. I was waiting for this since it was rumored. Now I'm greatly disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't gotten round the Korean film yet, but as I understand it the premise is pretty much the same; a businessman is kidnapped and locked away in a fake hotel room for twenty years before suddenly being released. Naturally his first course of action is vengeance on the mysterious figure who put him there, but who is this mysterious figure? And more crucially, why did he have this man imprisoned for twenty years and then set him free again? It's the answers to these questions that permeate the remake (while I understand the Korean version is focused more on the revenge?).That premise is pretty much a winner no matter what, but I can't help but feel that the film doesn't really know what it wants to do. It attempts to juggle too many different angles at once rather than letting one or two of them develop. I guess you could say it feels a little rushed. There's also some pretty awkward moments too, potentially as a result of the film's indecision. For example Joe is in a car with Marie trying to uncover the identity of this mysterious figure, and she reaches over and touches his face. Everything about it just seems awkward, but I can't help but feel, especially in retrospect, that it was meant to be more of an endearing reach of affection. Instead it just comes off as "I'm going to randomly stroke your face now...while driving."This becomes even more apparent when the crucial sex scene approaches. As it's happening you're sat there wondering where the hell it came from. The characters showed no interest in each other, there was no build-up or development. It almost seems like a scene put in for the sake of showing some nipples and buttocks in an attempt to shoehorn in a romance. That is until the big twist at the end when that sex scene becomes pivotal to everything. The single most important scene in the whole film comes out of nowhere with no build-up, no immediate sense of significance, and no chemistry. That is not a good sign. That said, the twist itself is really well done. I mean, we saw it coming, but it's presented in such a way that you're sat there thinking "They actually went through with that?!" It's a great twist because it's pure shock factor, despite it's predictability. Not only that, but there's more to it that's certain to sicken you.On that note, this mysterious figure is a bit of an odd one. Once the reason for the imprisonment is revealed you're left wondering how twisted this villain's mind really is, because it makes no sense whatsoever. He's obviously severely screwed-up in the head, but the complete lack of logic does make it a bit of an unsatisfactory explanation. I don't have a clue what's going on with his accent either. Sharlto Copley does a good enough (if slightly hammy) British accent, but there's no reason for him to have a British accent. His character is American, and spent some time in Luxembourg, but neither accent is present. Why is he British?!In all it wasn't a bad film by any means, but it wasn't particularly revolutionary either. And I can say that without bias as I haven't seen the original Korean movie. All the actors lacked chemistry with each other, the cinematography and music was just about as average as you can get (despite some promising promo shots), and the tone and direction of the movie was all over the place; there's a random extended kung-fu scene in the middle of the movie that comes out of nowhere. All that said, I did enjoy it. I will probably watch it again at some point. For that it deserves a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inferior to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"-You might wanna think about what you're doing here!" "-I've been thinking about it for the last 20 years."I could criticize the fact that this was yet another unnecessary remake considering Chan-wook Park's 2003 Oldboy has become a cult classic among worldwide audiences, but knowing this, I still decided to go ahead and watch Spike Lee's version, so I can't just claim it was unnecessary. I had curiosity as to what Lee could bring to the table and thought that the cast was pretty interesting as well. After seeing this film I can honestly see how difficult it must have been for Chan-wook Park to pull off such an ultra-stylish and violent movie, because Lee never manages to engage those of us that are already familiar with the revenge story. One of the things that the Korean film had going for it was the fantastic shocking ending, and Lee couldn't just rely on that surprise factor now. It would be like having someone remake The Sixth Sense; it would be an impossible feat to pull off considering how it relies heavily on that final twist. The other scene we all remember from the original film is the hallway hammer scene, and there was no way Lee could have left that scene out. He should have though because the scene felt completely out of tone with the rest of the film. The violence in this film never seems to have a purpose like it did in the Asian version. What this Oldboy lacked was the style and sense of purpose that Chan-wook Park's version had with some memorable characters and unforgettable scenes. The chemistry between Brolin and Olsen is nothing compared to the leads in the Asian film who really kept us engaged and interested in the story. This just proves how difficult it really is to capture that sense of style some of the Korean directors handle so masterfully. The general story is pretty similar to Chan-wook Park's film with some minor changes. The screenplay was actually adapted by Mark Protosevich from the Japanese manga, not the film. This time the anti-hero's name is, Joe Doucett (Josh Brolin); he's an advertising executive who is kidnapped and held captive in a small prison decorated as a hotel room for 20 years. During his mysterious abduction his wife is murdered and he is framed for the crime, while his 3 year old daughter, Mia, is adopted by another family. Not knowing who is holding him captive and for what reason, Joe's only window to the world is the television set he has in front of him. During his captivity Joe decides to get back in physical shape and stop drinking, hoping some day he can confront his captors and return to his daughter. Finally after 20 years he wakes up in a box a free man with no explanation as to why he was held captive all these years. He is given a cellphone, some cash, and the letters he has written for his daughter. The first thing Joe does is find his friend, Chucky (Michael Imperioli), who owns a nearby bar. Chucky helps Joe make a list of the people who might have done this to him. Joe also befriends a nurse named Marie (Elizabeth Olsen), who believes his story after seeing the poor conditions he's in. Together they search for answers as Joe plans his revenge, but the real question is why he was held captive for so many years and then all of a sudden released. Josh Brolin wasn't bad in the lead role, while Elizabeth Olsen also delivered a solid performance, but the film relied heavily on the chemistry between both characters and it wasn't really there. Samuel L. Jackson had a wacky supporting role, while Sharlto Copley played a convincing villain. His performance reminded me the most to the original character because he was more creepy than actually frightening. There were some minor changes to the ending which I thought weren't as effective, but perhaps it had to do with how shocking I found the original film. This film is much shorter than the original and perhaps it's not all Lee's fault considering the studio didn't allow him to release his original 140 minute cut which could have given the characters a better background story. This version felt rushed at times. If you have't seen either film skip this remake and watch the original instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's alright, but nowhere near as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My goodness, it's another unnecessary remake that is underneath the superiority of the original. Sure it's a bit more twisted in certain areas, but that doesn't equal a better film. It took the classical touches of "Old Boy" and tried to add this hardcore cheap trash style to it. I will just say, it's still entertaining but highly unnecessary. Despite the slightly different twist and turn it doesn't add anything new or better. The realistic aspect of the original well for the most part goes out the window for this one. It's a watchable flick, but I highly recommend the original first. Josh Brolin is however probably the best choice for a Western version.5.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The good: 5 stars for Brolin and S. Jackson. The bad: Everything else is annoyingly mediocre. The story and screenplay have been altered slightly, but not without plenty of plot holes.The Ugly: No emphasis on character study. The movie moves too fast and falls short in actually projecting the original's darkness. Besides Brolin, S. Jackson and Copley, the cast is incapable of bringing depth to the characters. Copley and Jackson have mostly been under-used.Conclusion: Josh brolin needs to be credited for his hard work. He comes close to Min Sik Choi in the original. Overall, the movie is unfortunately disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was actually one of the very few people who was excited about this movie. Oldboy(the original) remains to be one of my favorite films of all time. The philosophical messages, the Mise en sc?ne, and the acting, they all came together beautifully. An American remake, created by the great Spike Lee made me feel as though this film had a lot of promise, and I was severely disappointed.The original had an immensely shocking ending with a purpose, the shocking ending was what made me and hundreds to thousands of other audience members alike with a face of shock and disgust as the credits roll. The remake attempted to up the scale without any purpose, and still managed to be the exact opposite of shocking. All I'm gonna say is that it has something to do with sex. The original had a purpose for it's shocking conclusion, while the remake just kept trying to up the scale clumsily and ended up falling flat on it's face. The remake also extended the beginning, it showed more light to the protagonist and actually got us to hate the guy. The original showed some light but the protagonist was still somewhat likable, at least compared to the remake.The fascinating thing about the original is that you actually like the guy and you feel disoriented just like he is about being trapped inside a motel room. The remake was honestly just trying way too hard to be like the original rather than being it's own film and that's why it failed. I would actually recommend seeing it if you're an aspiring filmmaker, purely for the shots that are made(The shots were remarkable. I have to say that). However as for story, acting, and as a movie as a whole? It was pretty bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WORST rendition EVER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give it three points because there were but only a handful of scenes where it kept the level of depth, darkness, and suspense the original had. How could you take a masterpiece like Oldboy from S.Korea and kill with Josh Brolin. I am not one to bash films, and whatever positive feedback you get on this film is someone who never watched the original. The first 20 minutes of Josh Brolin's character development is horrible, worst acting he's done. And I love this guy, but not here. Elizabeth Olsen is the ONLY actress that did well consistently, and it has nothing to do with her nudity. She saved the film.The dark comedic fighting scenes from the S.Korean version were disappointingly translated as goofy, unrealistic and reminded me of the older batman movies by Tim Burton. The antagonist of the film ruined the whole movie for me personally. The original antagonist is a badass, smooth, psychopath with a vengeance much like Christian Bales character in American Psycho. Unfortunately, the U.S. version botched this brilliant character into a 5 yr old pervert with some money to create his revenge. Last but not least, the ending climax was what killed it. Worst acting by Josh Brolin. I'm no director, but the shots were horrible and anti-climactic. Zero build up, and once again, Josh Brolins response was a wannabe rendition of the original. He just couldn't pull it off. I think only Leonardo DiCaprio's or Tom Cruises ability to go fully passionate could have pulled off the end. Josh Brolin was meant to go psycho to protect his daughter, but he ended up giving a pathetic puppy dog face to the antagonist. The details, are everything for such a film. PLEASE DO YOURSELF JUSTICE BY WATCHING THE ORIGINAL. You will NOT be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a big fan of the original "Oldboy" (not in the sense that I boycotted this movie and own six copies of the original), I watched Spike Lee's version with a bit of a closed mind. I've never been a fan of American remakes of classic foreign films, and was a bit confused that this version came out only ten years after the original. But I wanted to give it a try, since Lee's film portfolio had some good entries in it (I also enjoyed 'Inside Man').Needless to say, I thought this was a great retelling. Brolin's portrayal as the protagonist was convincing, and I couldn't help but feel terrible for him and the torture he was put through. The action is well done, and there is a realistic progression of events, although the 'identifying the villain in the yearbook' part was kind of unconvincing to me. Elizabeth Olson was pretty good in her role as Marie Sebastian, and Sharlto Copley did fantastic as the villain. Another complaint I had was that the villain in the original was tough and unrelenting while the antagonist in this version was a little weaker, both physically and emotionally in comparison. But maybe that's what makes this version a little more original.It was intense when it needed to be, it was heartbreaking when it was supposed to be, and overall, I was left with a satisfying experience that I would be more than glad to expose my friends to in the future.I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Poor Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie last Friday.Movie critics and fans of the Korean cult classic have been trashing it.But I had to see it myself and assess whether the poor ratings it had received are deserved considering that it only has a 4.8 rating at IMDb,which is even lower than that of Zinda,a trashy Bollywood remake of the Chan Park-woo's film,at 4.9 rating at IMDb.In the end,Spike Lee's 2013 version of Oldboy,which stars Josh Brolin, Elizabeth Olsen, Sharlto Copley and Samuel L. Jackson,was obviously disappointing and as one reviewer stated,"An insult to the original film".I made a promise three years ago that if the remake that Hollywood was planning to release will be better,I would cut my tongue like Oh Daesu at the conclusion of original film.Fortunately for me,I was spared from committing that act.LOLThis new version follows the plot of the original almost to the letter as it tells the story of Joe Doucette, an alcoholic who is abruptly kidnapped and held hostage for 20 years in solitary confinement, for no apparent reason. Then,he is suddenly released without explanation and begins an obsessive mission to find out who imprisoned him.In the end,he only discovers the real mystery on why he was set free and finds he is still trapped in a web of conspiracy and torment.While the film replicated many of its bloody and violent set pieces like the memorable hammer scene,the oppressive feel of prison cell and incest part from the cult classic,it fails to deliver the same levels of atmosphere or menace as well the surrealism, gritty violence and raw emotion provided by the original.What's worse,the remake took the shallow and safe path to please American audiences by providing somewhat a happy ending instead of pushing the envelope which became detrimental to the overall film.The love story between Joe Doucett and Marie was contrived that the viewers would probably felt it was more like a fling instead of true love felt by each other.There were some critics saying that the character of Marie was an improvement to that of Mido from the original.But I felt that here motivation for helping Joe find the reason behind his captivity and finding her long lost daughter was somewhat forced into the story as well.While Brolin gives a good performance as a man confronting his isolation and his conscience, on a journey signposted by guilt and redemption,it was nowhere near the performance given by Choi Min-sik as Oh Dae-su as viewers will definitely care and feel for him unlike Joe in this movie. As far as the other performances in this movie,it was far from memorable.I felt that Sharlto Copley's Adrian Pryce as Joe's enigmatic adversary veers a little too close to cartoonish character rather than a flawed human being like Lee Woo-jin from the original.His motivations for locking up a person would provide more confusion for they aren't clear at all.Was it really about familial love or simply a complete derangement? While Elizabeth Olsen may satisfy her male fans with her sex scene in it,her character Marie looks lost especially with the emotions she felt towards Joe.Was it love or was it just a sexual desire that needs to be fulfilled?Finally,the ending simply was awful and abrupt as Joe simply gave up on his idea of revenge after learning the truth about her daughter and when Adrian shot himself.Overall,the performances and the story just gave more questions rather than a resolution to the story as there were a lot of plot holes in it and the characters' motivations aren't clear at all.And worst of all,the theme is about revenge and how it destroys one person simply got lost in the process as Joe was more concerned about finding his daughter.After viewing the original,it left me silent for more than five minutes to contemplate on how great the movie that I have seen.As for the remake,it left me happy for being spared for cutting my tongue and sad for more than five minutes on how awful this version really was.Too bad that the Hollywood has yet to realize that some foreign films should just have not been remade as evidenced by this remake simply destroyed the cult classic's legacy instead of adding up to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A washed up alcoholic is kidnapped and imprisoned in a single room by his unseen captors for 20 years. After finding that he has been framed for murder he sets out for revenge and vindication. And while bettering himself in the process he aims to find out why he endured his confinement.A solid remake of the great South Korean film based on the Japanese Manga 'Oldboy' by Nobuaki Minegishi and Garon Tsuchiya. With plenty of homage's to Chan-wook Park's 2003 original Spike Lee adaptation makes some minor changes to the story some are for the better including a more fitting closing. Pacing however does feel choppy/rushed in places possibly due to studios heavy editing intervention.Lee's offering is wonderfully filmed and acted, Samuel L. Jackson leaves an impression but Josh Brolin excels and clearly was 100 percent dedicated to the role, surprisingly executing the action scenes with surreptitiousness. The casual viewer may not find the dark humour, peculiar characters or reveal palatable. Nevertheless it equals or debatably surpasses the likes of Sixth Sense, Angel Heart, The Usual Suspects to name a few with its surprise ending. Ultimately, those who want a gritty psychological thriller with a spot of action and a fantastic twist look no further.Possibly curious viewing for fans of Park's original but a compelling must see for viewers not familiar with the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Park Chan-wook directed "Oldboy" in 2003, a sleazy thriller dressed up in up-market cinematography and portentous music. Director Spike Lee would remake the film in 2013, replacing its kitschy aesthetic with something more appropriately tawdry.But treating trash as trash doesn't make a particularly interesting film. This is still the tale of a man being abducted, confined for years and then tricked into sleeping with a relative. The only major difference is Lee's unwillingness to titillate with violence, a deliberately low-brow aesthetic and the insertion of various ethnic minorities. The film's narrative arc, in which irresponsible white people incestuously damage one another, mirror's Lee's "Red Hook Summer", a little masterpiece in which black, urban communities do the same.Done for the money, "Oldboy" was a box-office bomb. Actress Elizabeth Olsen outshines its entire cast.4/10 ? Worth no viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OLDBOY is a grim and unpleasant film for sure, but compared to Park Chan-wook's Korean masterpiece, this remake is weak sauce indeed. Spike Lee's version of the tale is a grim and nihilistic outing that takes away most of the original's power and style, leaving it an oddly hollow, uninvolving, and nasty viewing experience.A brutish Josh Brolin takes the lead role and fails to bring the complexity that Choi Min-sik added to the part. Brolin's character is a mere thug who never gains the viewer's sympathy for a moment despite the dark journey his character undertakes. In support, Samuel L. Jackson is quite poor basically playing himself, and Sharlto Copley has possibly the fakest-sounding British accent heard in a movie; what were they thinking? A surprisingly sincere Elizabeth Olsen is the only one who gives what I consider to be an impressive performance.The plot follows that of the original quite closely but smooths away rough edges and the nastier implications of the original narrative. It's not as controversial, let's say that. Certain scenes, like the infamous corridor fight, aren't a patch on those of the original film, and I found the ending to be a particular disappointment. Just another needless remake, then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oldboy was a complete masterpiece; a gritty, haunting and stone cold revenge thriller featuring some of the most goosebump inducing, devastating movie moments I've ever seen in a foreign film. So why remake it? I'm not sure anyone knows the answer to that question, especially when this made $4 million on a $30 million budget. The story remains intact: A man is locked up in solitary confinement for 20 years and then is released without warning, sending him on an odyssey of revenge which showcases the extremes of human emotion and meditates on revenge. No sorry, that's the original. This is a pulpy, mean spirited, detached movie which is the perfect cinematic representation of someone who thinks they're tough when they're actually a complete wimp. The original was not about violence. It was about people and emotions. This is about violence, and revenge and anger. Therefore, it's a movie which continuously uses mean spirited violence and explicit content to distract from the lack of depth, making this less a hard hitting revenge film, more Diary of a Wimpy Kid.To be fair, the captivity sequence is in some ways better than in the original. Spike Lee directs the film in a claustrophobic and haunting manner with some reasonably moving moments and good performances from Josh Brolin and Elizabeth Olsen, but Sharlto Copley is an embarrassment as the villain. When the legendary twist comes along, it doesn't make any sense. How did the villain know the main character (Who we're meant to sympathize with even though he's a complete jerk) would fall in love with the Elizabeth Olsen character? Why did the villain enact such a needlessly complicated scheme based entirely on chance? His back story doesn't make sense either. While the twist involving incest is still shocking, it's not as harrowing as it was before. This is a suitably grim movie with plenty of brutal moments, but it doesn't pull off the surreal and otherworldly atmosphere required for such an unusual plot. Even looking at this away from the original, this is a detached thriller with a plot which makes no sense at all. The ending doesn't solve anything either. It's not the horror some remakes are, but as I'm sure you all know what I'm going to say next: Watch the original instead.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last night, it was Oldboy's turn on the viewing screen. This would be Spike Lee's 2013 remake, not the original Korean masterpiece. Josh Brolin stars as a man who's inexplicably imprisoned for 20 years and then, just as inexplicably, allowed to escape. Also among the cast are Elizabeth Olsen as a kind-hearted clinic worker and Samuel L. Jackson as himself. (Okay, not really.) The trouble? If you've seen the original bloody mess (in a good way), then you have no reason to see this. Much like Gus van Sant's remake of Psycho in 1998, 2013&#x2032;s Oldboy is pretty much the same as its predecessor. That's fine if you're making a horror movie, maybe, or an action movie ? films that can skate by with gaps in plot. But if one of the highlights of the premise is a shocking twist, then either you're counting on your audience not having seen the original or you think it doesn't matter even if they have. True, Chang-wook Park's movie was in Korean with subtitles, but it had (and continues to have) a strong cult following in the U.S. as a visceral, alarming masterpiece with a truly malicious twist ending. That's what made that movie so special. Spike Lee's version merely copies a winning formula, but if people have an idea of what the out-of-left-field plot twist is, the impact of that twist is somewhat blunted.Here's a second problem. In the original, the violence is over the top camp. In the remake, it's less over the top and more of a cheesefest. Picture this ? one iconic scene in both films has our protagonist trying to escape from the evil clutches of his captors. Seemingly scores of henchmen pour out of elevators and doors, trapping our man in a hallway. In Park's version, the bloodletting seems to be intentionally comical. In Lee's version, it just looks comically stupid. You don't have to slow down the DVD to notice that, while waiting their turn to attack, the thugs will jump up, down, ahead, back, to give the impression that they're in on the action. If Lee was trying to poke fun at how a group of crooks never attacks all at once, then lack of subtlety hurts the scene; instead of a fine tweak with a wrench, we get bludgeoned with a sledgehammer.As the movie progressed, I kept in mind the Big Twist. As I noted above, it's still there, essentially unchanged. I'm not sure what Lee could have done to make his twist differ, even a little, from Park's twist. Maybe there was nothing to do. In which case, my question is simple ? Why remake the movie in the first place? Brolin is really good and carries the film in some scenes. Olsen is even better here than she was in Martha Marcy May Marlene; she has a strong screen presence and more than holds her own with Brolin (and Jackson, although they have scant time together). The problem here isn't the acting. The problem is the writing and the directing. This Oldboy is generic, lifeless, and redundant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be fair, it's not a bad movie, I'll start saying that the end twist it's good enough to make enough merits on it's own. Brolin does a good job, but nothing exceptional. The nemesis, Copley, felt a bit overacted and didn't quite hit the target for me.. Most of the characters lacked development, maybe as a product of the "heavy editing" that the movie suffered from the studio, as I've read in the trivia section. Also, there's a couple transitions that felt completely horrible and unprofessional, and maybe we can blame the studio editing for that too. What I was more expectant to see how would Spike Lee get done was the famous fight scene in the hallway. In the original, I liked the perspective, the movement of the camera and the lighting, but the choreography was bad and (maybe typically from oriental movies) overacted or childish. In this version, not only was badly choreographed and unrealistic, but not even the photography was satisfying. The other weak point is the confinement part of the movie, lacks of time to develop and make the viewer take conscience of the time the character spends there and how it wears him down. So, as a remake, I'd stay with the original, and as a stand alone movie, I would say that it's an average movie. Still, it IS a remake, and the weight of the original is there and it's difficult not to compare them.Good acting from Brolin, good story, good writing with exceptions, fair photography, weak fight choreography. It would be interesting to see the director's cut, as it seems that the editing from the studio took too much off the movie. Not really necessary as a remake anyway, as the original is well known and respected for occidental audiences. Worth the view with the new ending twist, but fans from the original will be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spike Lee's OLDBOY is the remake (really, one of many) that never should have been made. It does add some more character development for the main character (here renamed Joe Doucette), but the movie essentially unfolds the exact same way as the original. Granted, you have Samuel L. Jackson as a colorful personality who runs a rather sadistic business, but it's almost like he's in a different movie and his part of the story doesn't really add anything fresh to the proceedings. If anything, it's a bunch of unnecessary explanation for events that occurred in the original. Still, once Joe gets out of his room the movie is a somewhat interesting mystery, even if the questions are still the same. Sharlto Copley does a serviceable job as a villain with more than a few idiosyncrasies, personality quirks and secrets, but the denouement to the story is botched largely due to him. If the movie was passable up until the third act, the ending undoes any goodwill there might have been. Instead of the sheer nihilism of Chan-Wook Park's original, Spike Lee decided to go for something more bittersweet and, quite frankly, sappy. Fans of the original won't like it, and I'd be hard-pressed to find anyone not familiar with the original who will like this either. It's also a failure as a Spike Lee film, but still a mildly interesting failure.</fullReview>

It did have a couple of actors in it that at least I knew their style. I have always like Brolin as an actor. I think that is the first step. I think he did a great job in this one. But if you don't like his style of acting than you will think that this movie is bland. Sharlto Copley, every movie I have seen him in I have liked. He can play different rolls, this was yet another one that it fit him. Samuel Jackson, well we know who he is, but he is not a main actor in this, he is just a co-star but....he nailed this part.Understand that it does have a pretty sick and twisted ending. So if you are one of those people that just takes a movie as what it really is and that is just.....A MOVIE. Than it is well worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oldboy (2013) is an authentic piece of junk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I declare myself unable to write an objective review of the remake of Oldboy. The original film is a fascinating experience full of memorable scenes, excellent performances and an extraordinary ending. Why was a North American remake made? I have no idea. And why was it directed by Spike Lee, a filmmaker with a unique and personal vision? I don't know. It would have been easier to condemn this remake of Oldboy if it had been directed by an anonymous studio puppet; but with Lee behind the cameras of this piece of junk, it's more difficult to accept the laziness with which it was made. Supposedly, screenwriter Mark Protosevich didn't attempt to write a formal remake of the original film, but a new adaptation of the "manga" which inspired it. And I haven't read that comic, so I'm unable to evaluate which film was more faithful to it... but I honestly think that's irrelevant. The key points of the story are the same ones, and the changes feel artificial and forced, drawing the attention to themselves as "innovations" which can't remotely make us forget about the original film. Among the very few pros from Oldboy (2013), I can mention the performances from Josh Brolin, who makes a credible work as a man who lost big part of his life, and Elizabeth Olsen, who feels sincere as a nurse who feels compassion for the main character. Samuel L. Jackson is completely wasted in his character, and Sharlto Copley's performance as the main villain is atrocious, and the way his character was written, even worse. I would truly like to hear opinions of spectators who saw Oldboy (2013) without having seen the original film. Even though I tried, it was impossible for me to watch this remake with objectivity, so I recommend you not to waste your time in this pathetic movie. I think that not even the remake of Psycho was as bad as Oldboy (2013)... there's no need to say more than that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been awhile since I've seen the original Korean film that this remake is based upon and therefore I don't remember it that well - I will make some comparisons based on my rather vague memories of the original.The biggest problem that I found with this film lay with the screenplay; it just felt rushed to me and the writers seemed to try and connect things together, but ultimately in a 'haphazard' manner. The way that Joe Doucett (Josh Brolin) was introduced to Marie Sebastian (Elizabeth Olsen) was particularly contrived and far fetched. It almost felt like the screenplay was written in about 10 minutes and then they just slapped it together and hoped for the best - which is really bad given the fact that they had source material to work from. Spike Lee's remake gives more of a back story regarding Joe's character than the original and I can only assume that the writers felt that this was a good idea as it will give us a better understanding of Joe's many failings. In some ways it does, but for me it had the opposite effect as it actually made me hate him and not want to root for him. In the original, Oh Dae-Su was far from perfect, but I did find that I cared for his character a lot more than I cared for Joe.The remake also didn't seem to fully explore Joe's incarceration - this was something that seemed to be explored better in the original. I felt Oh Dae-Su's pain and felt more of a sense that he was suffering. I also found the original more believable particularly with reference to Oh Dae-Su's fighting skills - more time was spent showing him training which made his impressive fighting ability to be more credible. Compare that with Joe's incarceration and his extreme fighting ability seems a lot less believable.Another really big problem with this remake is that I was pretty bored whilst watching which isn't something that I could say when watching the original film. In fact had it not been for the fact that I had seen the original film I probably would have switched it off. As previously mentioned all of this isn't helped by the fact that the remake is hampered by an awful screenplay; Copley is the villain of the piece and is a good actor, but he's hardly intimating and almost has a comical aura about him (compare that to the villain in the original Oldboy and you'll see what I mean). It's also sad to see Samuel L Jackson's talents being wasted in a role that sees him handling a thinly written character that seemed to serve no purpose in the film.My advice (if you haven't watched the remake of Oldboy yet) is to check out the original first before seeing the remake. If you've already watched the remake and were disappointed (as I was) then check out the original to see how good it should be. The only positive that can be drawn from this remake is that it will make more people aware of the superb Korean original film which is a good thing as far as I'm concerned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since the success of the Grudge, 10 years ago, American filmmakers have been looking to popular overseas films for original ideas, many times simply remaking them. To many, this seems like a desperation move for original material, but I see it more as a cultural thing. Movies often reflect the society of the country they were made in, and by remaking them in the United States, the story introduces movie lovers to something unique, from a different culture. I personally find this very desirable and have appreciated many of these remakes, even when I didn't love the story. In his latest venture, Spike Lee takes on the Korean classic, Oldboy. This is a film that was remade simply because of how bizarre and shocking the story is. The year is 1993, and Joe Doucett (Josh Brolin) isn't a great guy. For some reason, he's drugged and then locked away in a pretty decent looking room without doors or windows, and held there for exactly 20 years. Then, just as suddenly as he was imprisoned, he was released, and goes on a search for answers, in this seemingly new world. Josh Brolin stars and is usually pretty good as an ancillary character, but as the star of a thriller, I was skeptical. As always, he could have shown some more emotion, but he was much better than I thought he'd be. Spike Lee gives him as much help as he can, by giving him a huge cast of supporting actors, all of whom had name recognition. In particular, Samuel L. Jackson playing a psychopath, was very funny, and definitely injected some much needed humor. Oldboy is one of those films where it all comes down to the ending. If you're unfamiliar with the story, I won't say anything other than to tell you, that it is bizarre and twisted, with an ending the likes of which you couldn't possibly have imagined. Even if you start to watch this film and don't really like it, stick with it, because the ending really is that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>History won't repeat, I mean sometime in a remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my all time favorite world cinema is the Korean version of this movie. Remakes are okay, but some movies won't suit for recreation because of its masterpiece value, believing that won't come close for the second time. Just like Mona Lisa, Starry Night, Birth of Venus, The Last Supper and other arts, it should have left alone untouched. Like Japanese did, because it was their story after all. This American version was good, but very much commercialized with the fast pace approach kind of ruined. If I had not seen the original, probably I would have liked it. I knew the twist so I did not get the excitements in those parts. So those who are not familiar with the 2003 movie can definitely have a good time.It was not a copycat from frame to frame, many things were altered in this movie. The most laughable was to see gangsters fighting with knives, hammers and bare-hand like the Korean style. What I know in American gangster theme is that they take a gun and bang bang. The first poster where Josh Brolin comes out of the large wooden box was kind of funny, gives the impression of a comedy movie. I liked Josh Brolin in 'Labor Day' and yet again he was not bad in this film except if you compare him with his counterpart from the Korean movie, Choi Min Shik. It is one of the best role he has ever played, sadly the movie was not received well due to many other reasons than him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>no ultra violence like the original one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And again, Hollywood is remaking a classic. This time the Asian cult classic Oldboy (2003). I'm not going to compare them because it's so difficult to do due the story normally taking place in the Asian world. This remake is also filed under horror and that's the reason I picked it up. Is it as ultra violence as the Asian one, no. The reason is simple, US versions will never have those ultra violence shots like the CAT III does. They have to be rated, unrated they wont be played in theaters. Well, not in the main stream ones. Nevertheless, it's still worth picking up because it do offer a few good moments. The acting is above mediocre. But I can't say that I enjoyed it the full movie. Therefor there wasn't enough violence involved. Even as I wont compare it with the original every gorehound walking this earth will remember Oldboy for it's violence and the hammer. It's still weird to see martial art being performed by an American. Just watch when the Japanese girl starts fighting, it brings you to another dimension. If you want to see a rather messy thriller then pick this up but for the horror buffs I have my doubts it will fulfill there needs.Gore 1/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 2/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>barely decent dumbing down of one of the best films ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I loved the original Chan-Wook Park version, I still saw Spike Lee's version as it's own, decent film,It starts off surprisingly well. It's modernized with smart phones, and less suspension of belief, but it loses steam and the pacing feels very rushed. Especially towards the second half of the film, the ending was so matter of fact, that you really don't find it all that shocking, emphasized by the lack of style. It wraps up in a nice little package. All that was missing was some happy licensed pop music at the end.Spike Lee's film was cut down from 3 hours, and missing character development. You know, to make the viewer sympathize with the characters, besides Josh Brolin? Even with that being said, All the symbolism and mystery is still watered down, or spoon fed to you every five minutes. The original ending hits hard because it originated from a point of innocence in both the protagonist and antagonist's lives. This new and improved ending nullifies that by making the antagonist damaged before anything Josh Brolin's character ever did. What's really telling of how badly this missed the mark is that hey never even had the time to explain why the f*&amp;# the movie is called Oldboy for f*&amp;#'s sake! As it's own film, it's still fairly decent but not worth watching again. Comparing it to The original though, I can't help but feel like Spike Lee's Oldboy has more in common with that Romeo and Juliet scene from Hot Fuzz, than Chan Wook Park's symphonic masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some good scenes but overall, very unnecessary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spike Lee's Oldboy is a classic exercise in Hollywood greed. To start, in no way does this film improve or better the original. This is an unnecessary remake but it does feature some very well done scenes, especially the beginning scenes with Doucett before he is incarcerated. But, the film doesn't carry the weight of the first film. This version of Oldboy gives us a more flawed hero and a less interesting villain. Josh Brolin gives a decent performance but this isn't his best, not by a long shot. The rest of the cast feels stale with the exception of Elizabeth Olsen. Jackson and Copely, two actors who are extremely gifted in range, don't do much for the film other than bog it down with shallow scenes of brutality. The film's pacing is good, but you can't help but feel this was supposed to be a lot longer and more detailed telling of Oldboy. Spike Lee directs some very good scenes, but the film's story and editing feel like a rush job. Sean Bobbit does amazing work here, as always. But this just goes to show, no matter what talent you have behind a film, it can ALWAYS backfire if you fall asleep at the wheel. Unfortunately, this is a film that had all the creative juices pumped into it during production and fell apart during post.Overall, this is worth a rental but nothing more than that. Don't rush into it thinking you will walk away with anything substantial. Quite honestly, this film is just an after thought at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless and disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oldboy is a strange, sluggish and violent affair, a remake of a film that was not exactly crying out to be remade. Lee calls it in, delivering an awkward, sporadically entertaining film, but in no way laying claim to it. It feels like it could have been made by any number of people. Adding to the disappointment is seeing a director of Lee's caliber stumble so often with such an interesting template as the first Oldboy. The basic premise is so fascinating that for large segments of the film we are at least entertained. It's the second half that sees the narrative fall apart, pointless or poorly acted scenes slow the momentum. Another thing: the violence. I'm desensitized to a point where I am not shocked by decapitations, rapes, murders, suicides of the likes found in 'Oldboy', but I am growing a bored of seeing films resort to this level of carnage as a narrative device. I understand now why audiences avoided this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the original film because of the remake, but don't get me wrong, I never heard of Oldboy until they started marketing the remake. My curiosity pushed me to see the original, an American remake for a Korean film, I thought to myself this film should be really good, otherwise it wouldn't have got Hollywood attention.Oldboy, still talking about the original, is a very disturbing movie. It takes you in a long and an exotic journey that ends with a big slap on the face. An ending that can't ever be expected by a sane person. Oldboy is a lovely meal of drama, bit of comedy, action, dark romance and an awesome soundtrack that will surely touch your heart. Excellent acting by the lead stars of the original made it as perfect as it is.Now back to the remake which is pretty embarrassing. First, the story is thrown at your face. There is no decent soundtrack. Shocking as it is, the acting of Josh Brolin was really bad. The relationship between the two leads was pretty much forced. Even the mysteriousness and the dominance of the antagonist was toned down to a shameful display. Truth be told, the fighting scenes looked more fast and violent than the original. Although they tried to replicate the camera angle and employed similar settings to that famous fight scene, the end result came out as a parody and not a tribute.My advice to you, watch the original one first and then watch the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joe (Josh Brolin) is an unpleasant young man - slipshod in his work, arrogant and self-serving in his relationships with others, borderline alcoholic, a bad father to his 3-year-old daughter, and generally a waste of space. After a night which ends with him rolling drunk in the street, he wakes to find himself in a locked room. For 20 years. During this time he cleans himself up and discovers himself, writing many unsent letters to the daughter who he sometimes sees growing up in occasional TV programmes about the murder of her mother, a murder which is blamed on Joe. Released without explanation after 20 years, he initially goes in pursuit of his daughter, aided by volunteer doctor Marie (Elizabeth Olsen) until his mysterious captor (and murderer of his ex-wife) sets him to solve the puzzle of his imprisonment: if he fails then his daughter will also be murdered.This is a US remake of a 2003 Korean movie. I have seen part, but not all of this, so I am not comparing: it is fair to note that the original has a passionate following who rate this remake very poorly.Taken on its own merits, it has both good points and bad points. It is often stylised, but the stylisation does not always sit easily with a hard-boiled and violent crime mystery. The simple story has unnecessary complications, although there are some interesting and unexpected plot twists. It makes no sense at all, at any point. And Sharlto Copley's mysterious villain is misconceived on every level.But Brolin is good, the relatively small amount of fight choreography is pleasing, there are some interesting and lengthy single takes, and the story is always intriguing, if unconvincing. And then there is Elizabeth Olsen, delivering a performance which belongs in a better film. She also takes all her clothes off, if that appeals to you (it certainly appealed to me, but then, I'm shallow and sexist).So, if you love the original then it is likely that you won't like this. If you've never seen the original, this might have something in it for your enjoyment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why this remake is a total disaster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I begin: It is nearly impossible to write a review of this version of "Oldboy" without making comparisons to the original. So, if you're looking for a critique which focuses solely on 2013's "Oldboy", look elsewhere.Now, for my review: Why was this film made?! What was the point?! Controversial director Spike Lee spearheads this remake of Chan-wook Park's adored 2003 Korean future classic, about a man who, after having been locked away for 15 years (this time it's 20) is bent on revenge; but Lee does it in the most forgettable way possible. Yes, Lee has retained the unapologetically gruesome and morbid atmosphere which made the original so shocking (in fact, this version is even bloodier). But as far as tone, story structure and character development is concerned, there was definitely something lost in translation; since much of this plot comes off as stiff, overly coincidental, convoluted, riddled with strange continuity errors and all around too outlandish for words. And while I do realize that the original (which I loved) is weird, overly coincidental and takes a while to get to the point, I need my outlandish over-the-topness laced with some kind of style. And shockingly, Lee bring little to no relevant style to the table.The Acting: Starring Josh Brolin, Samuel L. Jackson and Elizabeth Olsen (the most talented of the Olsen's) at the very least "Oldboy" should have contained some entertainment value in its performances. But if I confirmed that, then I would be lying. Here's the thing: When remaking a foreign film, one must tweak certain aspects in order for the content and mannerisms of the new film not to come off as foreign to its new audience. This did not happen here. Most notably in regards to the performances, which are so exaggeratedly melodramatic, that they come across as downright bad for the most part; to the point where I just wanted everyone to die for my sake.But arguably the most frustrating aspect of this film has to be split between two sequences in particular. The first comes about an hour in, when Lee egregiously mishandles the infamous long take hallway battle sequence. Originally this sequence was meant to visually shock with its choreography, while keeping the stakes high with it brutal realism. In Lee's version though, said sequence is reduced to little more than a terribly choreographed slapstick farce. The second sequence is basically the ending. And while I won't ruin it for the few that will actually stay till the third act, the final ten minutes, which seems to hold the largest discrepancy between this and the Park version, comes off as such a nonsensical misfire that it basically ruins what little plot traction "Oldboy" still had.Final Thought: This version of "Oldboy" is meaningless and should be forgotten as quickly as possible. In fact, this goes right up there with Gus Van Sant's remake of "Psycho" as a pointless exercise rather than a full fledged "movie".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't listen to the Spike Lee haters with Crappy Reviews, This movie was worth the Watch!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I must admit that I usually read 3/4 s of movie reviews on the IMDb site prior to watching a new movie on ITunes and/or new DVD. I dropped the ball on the Old Boy remake. I saw the original and must say it was really intense and GRUESOME. I was in awe of the acting and amazed how easy it was to follow, even subtitled. OK, but I am here to review the Spike Lee Joint, as he always proclaims. So here we go. Sub-Rating is in parenthesis.Acting (10/10) Josh Bronlin and Elizabeth Olsen were fantastic and extremely believable. Kudos to Spike and the Casting Director for finding the right characters and also for bringing in Samuel L. Jackson as the Landlord for what I like to call the Hell Hotel....I was very impressed to re-live "Old Boy" with popular characters we probably know and enjoy watching.Cinematography (8/10) Spike Lee has a knack of putting his own touch on films with unusual camera angles and unique character positioning. The fight scene choreography was well done and believe from beginning to end. The other truly unique thing was the placement of the sign that reads "Guns Don't Kill People....People Kill People. Storyline (910) The plot was extremely believable and of course it being a remake followed pretty well with original. Finally, if you did not know that this was not the first movie Samuel L. Jackson did which dealt with the subject of incest. He portrayed a father who committed incest with his daughter, unknowingly. The movie title was "The Samaritan". It's not one of his best movies. The acting was good but the plot strayed a lot and it was quite boring. There you go. Though it is a remake which usually brings in a lot of biased reviews as shown in the past. I recommend you give it a chance. It will surprise you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie having never seen the original (so sue me), and I'm glad I didn't see the original. This movie was only given 5 out of 10 on IMDb, but after seeing it I think most of the people who reviewed/rated it were basing it on the fact that it was a Remake, and they "don't like remakes". Well, I for one LOVED this movie. Josh Brolin plays the part well, and I was watching this film wondering how he was going to get through his "ordeal", and his character had me gripped to his plight, I needed to see how it all panned out. I don't care if people have seen the original and they don't want to give this version a chance, because in my opinion you should see this film. Spike Lee does a great job with this movie, and it shows in the performances for me. Then there's the plot twist near the end - WOW. My girlfriend and I were talking about this movie after we went to bed. It had that affect on us. Great movie, I don't care if its another "remake", I loved it. I give it an 8.5 out of 10.

		<fullReview>The original 'oldboy' was the greatest movie ever made! It had no imperfections, it was heaven delivered...was it really?If I was going to be honest, Min-sik Choi made that movie. Min-sik's performance was dominant, he embodied the role and put out the emotion and attitude to express perfectly what the protagonist was going through.The remake stars Josh Brolin, directed by the legendary Spike Lee, featuring the beautiful Elizabeth Olsen. Could you really ask for more. The movie didn't deviate all that much from the original.Sure, the fight scenes weren't as good as the original's and the plot was altered a bit, but I thought it was a relatively tight movie, with a script that was basically delivered from the original.Being rated a 4.9, to me it is obvious people are just bagging on it because it has been judged 'bad' not because it really is. I've seen movies that were plain average rated at 6, so what is really pulling this one down to a 4.9?Well, I do know why, it is because there was really no reason to remake this movie. The first one was, though not perfect, a masterpiece. It was good enough to make 'Americans' who are against subtitles and most 'foreign' movies take the time to watch. It left us impressed.We do that, us Americans, take something, re-brand it, call it ours.As much as I am against remakes in general, if you watched this movie, having never watched the original, it is still an enjoyable experience. If you watched the first one and spend the whole time comparing both, asking why, well, you aren't going to like it that much.Elizabeth Olsen and Josh Brolin performed well. Spike Lee directed it with a few of his 'style' touches, but kept the focus on the story rather than the cinema for the most part.It was not great, but it certainly wasn't bad. Put it like this, if you saw the original and you have no desire to rewatch it, there is no reason to watch this one. If you want to see a new take on the movie, if you never saw the first one, give it a shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Underrated, Amercanized Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was so disappointed with the original Oldboy's plot twist that I could hardly appreciate the movie. So I couldn't wait to see the remake to see how it would be handled, and was satisfied with the results. I give the new Oldboy a 7.5/10.There are several things that I missed from the original Oldboy. "You laugh, the world laughs with you. You cry, and you cry alone", this quote was a reoccurring theme in the original, and while I didn't understand its full meaning, its absence in the remake was noticeable. Joe's transition back into society wasn't as dramatic as the original. The original Oldboy's behavior was much more animal like, his first interactions with people was more dynamic, and his narration let us know more what he was thinking. And finally the remake was at times poorly paced; for instance, Joe is trying to find the person who locked him up and jumps to trying to find the restaurant where the takeout came from.The fight scene in the original Oldboy, in my opinion was over-hyped. I'll admit it was unique in that you see wide shot of the hallway while Oldboy fights his way through, but it wasn't engaging at all. You get more immersed in the fight scene of the remake. It is definitely an Amercanized version of the original which one could take as good or bad.The villain was so much better in the remake. The original villain blamed Oldboy for his sister's death, which was the villain's fault and could have been prevented. The original was so absurd (such as a device that could stop his heart), the new villain was upfront and wasn't nearly as nonsensical. And where the original villain was motivated to show Oldboy's sins were bigger than his own, the new villain was motivated by defending his family's honor, which Joe had indirectly ruined.I was a little surprised (and confused) by the remakes ending. I find it a little hard to believe that Chaney would even agree to see Joe again without killing him. And the audience is supposed to be sympathetic to the hero, so we don't want to see him being locked back up like he was at the beginning. But it is better than the original's ending which required Oldboy to be hypnotized so he could live his life guilt free.</fullReview>

Of the many gems he's created over the years, "Clockers" remains my favourite.But time passes and things do change...the last movie Spike Lee directed that can be even called relevant was "The 25th Hour" back in 2002. Since then Spike Lee, I'm sorry to say has spiralled slowly and steadily unto the lower rungs of movie directors.Either time has caught up with him, or he is just tired of directing movies, I don't know what it is, but whatever it is, he has to do something about it. And the first step would be to never, ever, ever direct such an awful movie as "Oldboy"! I have not seen the Korean movie, nor have I read the graphic novel, and frankly I don't care or want to. Still, this doesn't change the fact that "Oldboy" is soo inexplicably bad!!! I mean we are talking M. Night Shyamalan and Uwe Bowl kind of bad! This movie is a mess all around. Bad directing, bad script, bad acting...come to think of it, it is actually atrocious! I seldomly walk out of a movie theatre with hatred in my heart...but I did on this occasion! Not just hatred but disgust, not because of the subject matter covered by "Oldboy", but at seeing what amounts to a wet brainfart from a guy that used to be one of the greats! Honestly, if Spike Lee feels like he has no more stories to tell as a director, then he should just stop now before he exhausts whatever good will his fans still have towards him for all the great work he has done. It would actually be better if he just steps back and produces movies, perhaps scouts new talent and helps develop new projects etc. Someone with his background and pedigree should do well in such an endeavour.In the meantime, no more "Oldboy"! There was no reason for this movie to be soo f **king bad! The idea is interesting and the storyline should have made for some compelling viewing to say the least. Instead it turned into the proverbial turd in the punch bowl! Awful, awful piece of crap! The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1 is because of Elizabeth Olsen. This young lady has the makings of a good actress, and she desperately tries to lend credibility and insert some life in this putrid piece of feces! But it is not nearly enough to make up for all of the foulness of the movie!This is a stinker alright...and it stinks to high heavens!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Oldboy" is full of surprises - and twisted jaw-dropping twists!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Oldboy" (R, 1:44) is a terrible name for this movie because it tells you nothing about the film, but director Spike Lee took the name from the 2003 Korean version, so we can let it slide. Besides, you now have this review to tell you all about it. Who could ask for anything more? Well, a winning Powerball ticket would be nice, but failing that, I have a very twisty and twisted movie to review for you.Josh Brolin is Joe Doucette, an ad man and a seemingly irredeemable schmuck. His wife calls him a joke of a husband and father, actually a fairly kind assessment of his character. After blowing off his daughter's birthday for work and then going on a bender, he wakes up in a strange room made to look like a hotel room, but with no windows and a locked door with a small hatch that only opens when a plate of food is slid into the room. And so Joe stays in this room ? for 20 years! All there is for him to do is work out, watch TV and try to figure out why he's there and who put him there. Given his personal history, there are many potential culprits on the list. He actually does make a list and checks it ? more than twice. When he's released as suddenly and inexplicably as he was imprisoned, he sets out to find his daughter and get revenge on the person responsible for his kidnapping, even as that person, via cell phone, taunts and threatens him. Along the way, he gets help from an old friend (Michael Imperioli) and a do-gooder nurse (Elizabeth Olsen)."Oldman" is fascinating in its execution, revealing its many secrets over the course of the movie. When the reveals pick up speed towards the end, there are jaw-dropping surprises that will make your head spin. I thought the violence was a little over the top and didn't play as well as Lee obviously thought it would, but this is a very clever and very shocking movie, which is mostly VERY well-done.

		<shortDescription>Thoroughly enjoyable action &amp; acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie turned me into a true fan of Josh Brolin. He was totally immersed in his character, and he never for one moment made me think he was acting. The unpredictable plot, masterful acting by Josh Brolin and Samuel L. Jackson, and the perfectly-timed thrilling action scenes totally sucked me into the story. What made the movie more enjoyable was the artful mix of comedy, violence and love story. Although this is an impossible story that can only be found in comic books, Spike Lee almost made me believe it. After watching this remake, I could not bear to watch the original version by Chan Wook Park, which looked so contrived and surreal. As the movie played on, the victim turned out to be the villain and the villain turned out to be the victim. The final climax is in the ending: a shocking irony and a perfect punishment. The moral or the story is, everyone gets his just deserts. I loved it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although there's some controversy over re-making the classic movie, especially after only a decade, this "westernization" (and modernization) of the movie works well, especially for reaching a wider audience that might be put off with the subtitles of the original.Both versions have an effective story with the original taking a more solemn approach and the new movie having a more active desperation (based on the character knowing more about his daughter than the original). Both had a believable reaction to isolation and reintegration (with a tongue-in-cheek poke at the original plot with the mention of malnutrition).I can understand dislike of westernized versions of Asian classics but the actors give the original justice and though product placement is laughed at, a 2013 film without using smart phones and going back to an e-cafe of the original movie would have made no sense.Spoilers!! HUGE SPOILERS!! The ending of this movie is different, though in a way that has a different impact to the first movie.For one, the incestuous revenge plot has a more direct parallel and though some have claimed the villain in the new version had been raped and/or brainwashed by the incestuous relationship with his father, that does not appear to be how the character feels and may just be a violent reaction to a less acceptable incestuous coupling than a similar aged, straight relationship of the siblings in the first movie.Similarly, although there is a "fairy tale" resolve with the character choosing to lock himself away for the rest of his life and the girl driving off into the sunset, and as much as the 'tongue scene' from the original was powerful and emotional, the ending of the movie does not rely on unrealistic plots that the original movie expects the audience to accept (namely that the main characters were drawn together by hypnosis and the trauma of the revenge could also just be hypnotized away, and that one can survive cutting off one's tongue).Although the original leaves you guessing as to character motivations (One reading being that he silences himself, then has himself forget, to continue the relationship with his daughter in secret, even from her), the 2013 remake has a clear resolution of a character, who believes he was forced to do something wrong, acting selflessly to prevent further harm. A clearer message that is not worth the 1 out of 10 reviews for changing from the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Um, so...yeah, uh, I LOVED this movie. Having no inkling that it was a "poor" remake (according to the reviews on here), i was completely enthralled. Just sayin'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most people I became a fan of Josh Brolin after seeing him in "No Country For Old Men". However, this role is my favourite thus far. I found the film to be quirky, creepy, cathartic and riveting. Suffice to say I did not know it was a remake of a supposedly classic Korean film. Furthermore, I did not realize until the end credits that it was directed by Spike Lee. (This is not your typical Spike Lee film.) Is it ridiculous in parts. Yes. But what movies aren't. You suspend belief for Bond or Bourne movies, so why not this film. I chose to play along and I'm glad I did. It's the performances not the action that anchor you to a sense of realism. It reminded me of Kevin Smith's 'Tusk'. Preposterous stories made less so by the commitment to good story telling. It's why I watch movies. So, a Bronx cheer to the film students and highfalutin cinephiles who panned this. The 'Magnificent Seven' is no 'Seven Samurai' either. (Actually, I never saw the "Seven Samurai".) Is it a nine out of ten? Okay, maybe not. But it's not a 4 either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler: I'm not sure if I liked this movie or not. I want to say I didn't but still not sure. It was just so f*cked up on so many levels. Being such a huge fan of Josh Brolin I was intrigued to watch it. I watched it all the way through just because I wanted to see how it would play out. The storyline was interesting, f*cked up but interesting. I normally would have turned it off due to Samuel L. Jackson, he ruins every movie he touches. Not sure why people still cast him. he only knows how to play one role and that's of an annoying a-hole. Having recently discovered Elizabeth Olsen I find she is on the verge of a very amazing career. She can stand her own against any actor/actress and I do hope she carefully picks her projects so she doesn't get type-casted. She has successfully made a career away from her kooky sisters and she is going strong. I look forward to more of her work. And yes, this movie WENT THERE. oh wow, they went there. Dang.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not on the Level of the Original, but not as Bad as People Claim</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oldboy (2013), this film which is remade by Spike Lee done founded by towards the Korean original film of the same name released in 2003. This remake begins in a very intriguing manner. Many come to the conclusion which it is rushed (reports that the film had been cut about 40 minutes down- a major reason why) never felt like 20 years had passed. Although one thing, how and where does that turn Joe into a male that is capable of taking a plethora of healthy trained security guards and or assassins, they may have asked. Which is why it is not completely settled upon in the film.A standout scene which is well recording is where we see Joe having to defeat a large number of henchmen that come from seemingly no where from the streets to an alley way. The take is visually stunning and it runs for a while but it is an entertainment to watch. At this point, we see that Joe is taking somewhat of a beating but at no point does it feel as if he will be defeated. Although towards the end, Joe does end up getting slightly stabbed in the back with a knife. He later takes it out then all seemingly falls down, as he is later taken or departed to a hospital to take treatment. Many have complained about the ending being slightly more direct and different compared to the original. My thoughts upon is that the ending is good but seemingly very predictable. Not shocking really not exactly satisfying but it was well with how it came out. One may wonder what happens towards however, the taboo subject of incest can be considered to be handled more so in a to be put as kindly manner. However Joe's actions at the very end make almost little to no sense. The acting from lead Josh Brolin is well and is what makes the film passable. Elizabeth Olsen is also well present in her brief appearance and makes the best out of a tiresome character. A major reason why this film is as hated as it is, is due to the original and people whom phantom over the original do not like Hollywood's remakes (especially since the remake is only 10 years after). Had this film been a stand- alone film, with minor changes the overall perception of this film would be far more loved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Major Movie Review: Oldboy (2013)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For anyone that has seen the original South Korean film Oldboy and if you know what kinds of movies I dig and love to delve into,than you know that I'm into some twisted, violent, sometimes completely blasphemous stuff. With that I wanna add the 2003 version of Oldboy is one of my favorite foreign films of all time; it's brutal, disturbing, and had great direction but I can go on! Let's save that for a future review. Now, the question here is not why I was let go (&#x1f603;eh?) but how did I like this 2013 American remake directed by the great Spike Lee? Well... JOSH BROLIN'S in it.Joe Doucett (BROLIN) is a struggling advertising exec. with quite the drinking problem, he gets drunk in public, is extremely inappropriate and unprofessional with his clients, and seems to be neglectful of his 3 year old daughter, who's in the care of Joe's ex-wife. During a rough night of drinking, Joe comes across a mysterious woman with a. yellow umbrella, blacks out, and wakes up in a sealed off hotel room with no recollection of how he got there and who exactly is responsible. He spends the next 20 years in his mysterious prison, witnessing world events and his framed murdering of his wife until on the day of his planned escape he wakes up out in the world and sets out for revenge on who ruined his life.Please, check out my full review for OLDBOY (2013) on my Tumblr, link to that is in my InstaBio. Let me know what you guys think. I wanna start a new, more organized rating system similar to how I rated movies in my September movie preview. Ratings will go as ordered: "WATCH THIS MOVIE!" "CHECK IT OUT" "MEH, WHATEVS" "SKIP IT" and "KILL IT WITH FIRE!". I'm hoping you all take nicely to the change. Let me know what you guys think! How about this movie?

		<shortDescription>Lost the surrealism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 1993. Joe Doucett (Josh Brolin) is an angry ad exec who misses his daughter's 3rd birthday for a business diner. He is a womanizing drunk. He gets kidnapped and finds himself imprisoned in a motel-like room. He gets gassed periodically. He watches news report that he is assumed to have raped and killed his ex-wife. He vowed to clean up his act and makes an escape attempt 20 years later. He gets gassed again and finds himself in a suitcase trunk in an open field. He is led to nurse Marie Sebastian (Elizabeth Olsen) working at a mobile clinic. He reconnects to an old friend Chucky (Michael Imperioli) who was the last guy to see him. Chucky helps him investigate who it was that imprisoned him. Joe passes out and Chucky calls in nurse Marie. Chaney (Samuel L. Jackson) is the prison warden. The mysterious stranger (Sharlto Copley) is threatening his daughter. Then the stranger offers him vindicating evidence, his daughter's safety, $20 million in diamonds and the promise to kill himself if Joe can find out who he is and why he did it.It is hard to rate this because I saw the original first. That takes the surprise twist ending out of it for me. Director Spike Lee is doing a very straight logical interpretation of the surreal Korean original. It's dark and stark. It doesn't really have the magic and the weird left turns that the original keeps taking. The constant straightening out leaves this movie cold and unimaginative. It becomes nothing more than a revenge movie with a twist. Worst of all, Spike Lee left out the live octopus eating. I do like the final poetic ending. That is a nice little surreal touch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most of the movie... Okay. Ending... WTF...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so usually I like to start my reviews with a bit of a quip... a lighthearted story from my misspent youth...maybe a brief synopsis of the plot, but today is going to be somewhat different... I REALLY have to get something off my chest...The NEW ending to this remake SUCKS. It BLOWS. I know they were never going to get away with the original's hard-hitting finale... but to replace it... WITH THIS?! OMFG. HOW DARE THEY. They have taken the Korean version, p*ssed on it, s**t on it, tore it into pieces, then buried the remains in no-man's land. I was literally screaming at the screen as this excuse for a conclusion unfurled before my eyes... Which most put out the guest I had round. But I don't care... there are some times you have to make a public spectacle of yourself to emphasise a point. The 2003 Oldboy has been viciously butchered... and DESERVES retribution. I WANT NAMES.As hard as it is for me to take attention away from this utter travesty, we must move on. So, what's the rest of the movie like? Well for starters, aside from a few new unnecessary peripheral characters, and some added on plot elements that don't really work, it's almost a shot-by-shock redoing of the first telling of this story. It's not shabbily handled at all... Spike Lee is a good director.... Getting the best out of his performers, and filming the action sequences with satisfying panache. For those not familiar with the original, it would more than fill the criteria for a Saturday night in.Except... that isn't really the case. For Oldboy 2003 IS a 'thing', and by (figuratively speaking) copying so much from the classic, then having the CHEEK to tack on such an unsatisfying, ludicrous last few minutes is nothing short of an INSULT to non-subtitle viewers everywhere. And if you don't mind reading while watching... What the HECK are doing with this on, when you could be tuning into the original instead?! See that one first (like I did) THEN torture yourself with this if you must... but don't taint your memories of what is, in essence, a great story by sitting through 2013 Oldboy as your introduction. I'm being serious here..... 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not a horrible remake but not great either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since it's next to impossible to not compare a remake to the original, Spike Lee took on an ambitious project with the remake of oldboy. I remember watching the original at the suggestion of a friend and remember being wow'ed by the movie from the start (And I HATE foreign subtitled movies). The original has a dark twisted intensity that one doesn't come across very often, and it's one of the movies that's always been stuck in the back of my mind when I think of twisted dark plots. When I first heard they were doing an American-ized version, my mind immediately jumped to the conclusion that it would suck. While I'll concede this remake doesn't suck... it doesn't add anything to the original that makes it stand out from the original and is slightly above mediocre in my opinion.The general theme of the plot stayed close to the original, but of course there were plot changes that I mostly disliked. With the exception of the ending... I did find the alternative ending to be original, and a nice alteration from the 1st movie.While there was a nod to the octopus from the original movie, it was the octopus scene in the original that sent shivers down my spine and made me grimace. So I was rather disappointed there wasn't an equally shocking scene in this version. I was also greatly disappointed with the hammer fight. The original in the tunnel has gone down in my mind as one of the all time great movie fight scenes. While this one became larger &amp; more epic, it left me wanting more and just not excited.The movie also didn't delve into the emotional aspect like the original did, which made this movie less shocking and had me caring less for the characters like I did in the original. The love affair between Joe &amp; Marie was dismissed rather quickly,and I generally disliked the new plot twist about why he was imprisoned for so long. Especially since this movie breezed over it so quickly. Josh Brolin didn't have the intensity as the original actor. I don't know if that's because of his acting ability or was because of the direction he was given, but the final showdown between Joe &amp; Adrian came no where near as intense as Dae-su Oh &amp; Woo-jin Lee of the original.While I think it lacked the level of darkness the original did, overall it was a watchable movie. I think many people who haven't seen the original will like it, but for those that have seen the original, I suspect they will be disappointed like I was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not awful, but hardly a success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Josh Brolin gives it his all in the less than satisfying remake of the much better Korean film. Spike Lee's 140 minute cut was trimmed down by the producers and both he and Brolin have said they are disappointed with the end result. Even after cutting the film down Film District was closing it's doors and Oldboy was it's last distributed film and the cash strapped studio dumped it in 500 theaters with blink and you miss it advertising. But the real problem is the film's central mystery. A good portion of the film is spent watching Brolin in isolation and this is all perfectly watchable. But once he's set free, he goes on a mission to find those responsible and the film just isn't very interesting. There's some gratuitous gore that seems out of place, such as removing throat flesh in close ups and some laughably bad CG gore, such as a man's head being mostly blown off from a shotgun. That said, it's watchable, but it's a very flawed and unmemorable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I appreciate this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read a number of reviews of this film on IMDb. I respect the fact that everyone who takes the time to write something on IMDb does so because they have a point to make and they, usually, feel strongly about it.I did not see the original "Oldboy" although I was aware that the Spike Lee film was a remake. I am glad that I did not see the original because I believe that facilitates my evaluation of this version and helps me to be more objective. Having said that, I tend to remain objective about a movie even if I've seen a previous version. I think it's important to try to see each film on its own terms in order to experience what that particular film has to say. If the movie fails, it should fail on its own terms, not on the basis of what was done in another movie. When we see one version of "Macbeth" we evaluate it the work on its own merits, not on the basis of a comparison of what a previous actor did in the role.Comparisons are probably unavoidable, but I believe we should try very hard to not let them guide us too strongly in an evaluation of a work of art's merits or demerits.I first saw this movie in a hotel in May, 2014. I ordered it and was so impressed with the movie that I ordered it again the next night. I subsequently saw the movie again on Netflix earlier this week, and I remain impressed.The style of the movie, the emotional journey of the main character and his eventual acceptance of his own monstrosity and the justness of his "punishment" cuts deep. I believe that this film got something very, very right. Even the look, pace and "feel" of the film was seductive, sleek, and fast. I did not feel the ending was hokey, or a Hollywood happy ending; I felt the ending was sad but resolved, since the character found a level of peace in his acceptance of his crimes that was missing before. Joe Doucette was a trouble man, and his principal (if not his sole) means of expressing his angst was through violence to others, whether that violence was hazing schoolmates, ignoring his wife, neglecting his daughter, or using his fists to get answers.Even when Doucette sabotages an important business deal at the beginning of the movie, it's clear that it's unintentional; this is simply who this man is. Yet his journey teaches him a humility and sensitivity that is clear to see. The wonderful irony is that, despite the lesson he learned, he also learned that sometimes you can't get a "do-over." Once again, other films may be better movies but I try to judge the movie I'm looking at while I'm looking at it, on its own terms. It doesn't have to be the best movie I've seen, it just has to best movie I'm looking at while I'm watching it.This is just my attempt to evaluate the movie in a manner I think is as objective and useful as possible. Thanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This iteration of Oldboy is a good film in it's own right, but will fall short if you expect it to compete with the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In case you want to compare the original to this version than you'll surely be disappointed. Now that we got that out of the way let's dive into the review. This version of Oldboy can best be described as a 1.5x fast forward version of the original film. The film hits most of the major plot points from the original with some changes here and there, and at about 90 mins the film runs quickly through the narrative, yet it doesn't feel rushed or disjointed. While watching this film it almost felt as if the filmmakers assumed you watched the original, which is nice since the film hits it's high notes splendidly. The torture scenes are gruesome yet tasteful, at least within the film's realm of reality. Josh Brolin, who plays Joe Doucett, is perfectly casted as a troubled middle aged man who takes almost everything in his life for granted. The other cast members do a fairly good job with their roles, Elizabeth Olsen, who plays Marie Sebastian, is endearing and well-casted, Samuel L. Jackson brings that kick-ass factor, although his role in the film is minuscule, and lastly Sharlto Copley does a great job in portraying the insanely charismatic villain, Adrian. Without divulging too much of the plot, those who are afraid that this version is in anyways tamed will be pleasantly surprised by how intense things get, and like the original film, you'll be disturbed yet fascinated to find out what happens next. Although I'm not a fan of the ending of the film it doesn't ruin the film at all. It more or less gives audiences, who have watched the original film, a fresh interesting take from the original, which had you decide for yourself the tragic fate of Dae-su. Overall this iteration of Oldboy is a solid interesting thriller that will entertain anyone. But again, if you try comparing this film to the original than you'll obviously be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm reviewing this as a standalone title, having not seen the original.When I watched this, I thought there was something kind of off about the tone, and how it seemed to straddle multiple genres. I thought the big fight somewhere near the middle was either misplaced (too over the top) or sign of a wasted opportunity; the protagonist's skills rarely come into play later on. There were a couple of things that made me think Spike Lee messed up. Motivations were so-so.I did like the twist at the end. But, I don't know if I would feel the same in a second viewing. Sharlto Copley (Open Grave, District 9) is awesome as always. I liked Josh Brolin, and even though I think Spike Lee failed to capture the Korean-style tone he obviously intended to, I'll give him credit for creating one of the closest things to it.That said, I can be very forgiving in regard to flaws. I enjoyed it, glad I watched it once, and it led me to Chan-Wook Park's work, which is amazing. I plan to check out the original Oldboy, and just got finished with JSA, which was pretty great. For that, I'm grateful I gave Oldboy US a spin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It instantly moves into my top 20 films on IMDb rated lower than 6.0. It joins "Wasted on the Young", "World Trade Center", "Only God Forgives", "G.I.Jane", and "Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2/'86" and others in that regard. Granted, it's towards the end of that list.First, let me say that I AM a fan of the original. It is, however, my least favorite of the 'Vengeance Trilogy', but Oldboy is a solid film with some amazing moments. I rated all three of those fine films a 8/10, but if I had to put them in order, I'd put Sympathy first, Lady second, and Oldboy third.As a fan of foreign film I do get rubbed the wrong way when Hollywood shamelessly remakes these strong, foreign entries and gives little credit or justice to the original films. "Let Me In" and "The Girl With a Dragon Tattoo" have been two of the better ones, but almost never do they actually "exceed" the quality of the original. I even prefer "Infernal Affairs" to "The Departed", so I AGREE with most of the detractors, but I think they might be 'piling-on' here. We might even have some non-viewers chiming-in with this low of a score. I could be wrong - after all this is the same group that rated "Take Me Home Tonight" 6.4???? What a dreadful film.What's really getting lost in the low rating here are some actual 'improvements'. Yes, I know I have this rated 6/10, so obviously it's not as good as any film from the vengeance trilogy, but this does improve upon SOME aspects of the original.First, the acting is solid. At least on par with the original. Brolin is fantastic. Some of the supporting cast here is better and their characters more developed than the original. The pacing is better than the original(no question there, it's paced more like an American thriller). I think the original is a bit-slow. Most importantly, a big-new twist here is deftly handled. That's not to say that all the similar aspects are improved upon. The famous 'fight scene' isn't nearly as effective here, and does come off as a lazy, inferior rip-off.Some of the little nuances of the plot are much deeper than the original, and they really work with each character-arc quite nicely. I am dumbfounded with some of the 1 and 2 ratings/reviews - let's save those numbers for films that truly deserve it. I didn't even stoop THAT low for the remake of "Arthur", or the most shameless copy of all time, "Footloose". I'd disregard any review under 3 - that's just unrealistic, and probably the reason this is rated so low here. I mean we can remake "The Fast and the Furious" 7 times, but for goodness sakes don't remake a cult-classic foreign film or you're in-for-it with the IMDb traditionalists. Probably a good time to mention that EVERY 'Fast and Furious' film is rated higher than this remake.I put-off watching this because of the low score here. Don't. See it.64/100 You'll like this if you liked: Taking Lives(slightly below this),Unbreakable(ever-so-slightly-better), or Redemption(about even).And we can't have it both ways you guys.. either you're a "won't read subtitles guy" that probably doesn't watch many movies and you like this because you're not comparing it to the original, or you're the opposite.This film succeeds mightily because it manages to give homage to the original while giving us a completely different feel and a great spin on the ending. We could have had a mirror-image melancholy, slow-burning remake and the results on here would have been the same. For all those reasons - kudo's to Spike Lee. I'd argue that the 'worst aspect' of this film is the only moment where Spike used the original as more of a template instead of a starting point(the fight).I'm sure I'm in the minority here as someone who actually likes them both. Personally, I think the original is a touch over-rated, probably deserves about a 7.9 instead of 8.4, and this deserves more like a 6.4 instead of 5.7... jmo</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me preface this review by saying, I had never seen the original Oldboy before this movie was made, but I had heard of it. When I saw them both on Netflix, I figured what the hell, and watched the original, then the remake back-to-back and I have to say, the original is indeed better, but the remake is not at all as bad as the fanboys proclaim.Seriously.The acting is pretty much spot on. Josh Brolin is perfect in the lead. Sharlto Copely is EXCELLENT as always. Elizabeth Olsen is spot on with her role. And Samuel L. Jackson was a fun, unexpected, and surprisingly good fit for the warden. So, there are absolutely no problems with the casting.The story is mostly the same with a few change ups here and there, but nonetheless very similar with a plethora of homages to the original.The direction of Spike Lee is really quite good and the cinematography is really excellent. So no problems there.So, what then is everyone complaining about? Despite all of this, it just feels like there is something missing. And I come here today to offer an explanation as to why everyone is unhappy with this remake.Oldboy has a runtime of 1 hour and 45 minutes, and yet, Spike Lee's original cut was a full 3 hours before the studio did a Grade A Hackjob on it. That means they cut out nearly half of Spike Lee's cut. Which offers quite a reasonable explanation for the choppy-feeling dialogue, the jarring cuts, and the unexplained transitions. Really, we should all wait to see a Director's Cut before fulling judging this studio-ruined film that both Spike Lee and Josh Brolin have stated their opposition for.All in all, good, but could have been better and probably was better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Review: This movie is not even close to the original Oldboy, but it's watchable and the storyline has many twists which keeps it interesting. Josh Brolin put in an excellent performance, but it's the storyline that let's the movie down. If Spike Lee would have given the movie a different name and stayed away from the original, the movie wouldn't have been that bad, but the whole shock value from the original is gone so Spike Lee had to add in a few new elements which just didn't work. I also think that Josh Brolin wasn't the perfect choice for the leading role because of his, all American brutal acting style which is far from the character who played the original role, but that's not to say that he didn't give it his all. Anyway, the film is watchable and intense throughout, but I expected better from such a great concept. Watchable!Round-Up: Judging by the money that this movie made, it seems like people are staying away from Spike Lee movies nowadays because of his political views and the amount of arguments that he has had in Hollywood. Back in the day, his movies were very pro-black and he had a certain type of audience that always rushed to see his movies, but he has even lost that audience of late, hence the box office takings for this film. The question is, will he ever be taken seriously again? Anyway, Josh Brolin really pushed his acting skills to the limit with this film and it's a shame that he didn't get the props that he deserved. The weight lose and the mad fighting scenes showed that he was really taking this role seriously, but the script let him down. I would watch it again just for his performance, but the movie in whole was poor.Budget: $30million Worldwide Gross: $5million (Terrible!)I recommend this movie to people who are familiar with the original Oldboy which is about a man whose locked in a room 20 years. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oldboy is a remake of a well renowned Korean film by Chan-Woo Park: Oldeuboi. I went into this film, having seen the original 2003 adaptation of the manga "Old Boy" by Nobuaki Minegishi and Garon Tsuchiya. With great skepticism i approached Spike Lees version, as well with an opened mind.Brolin did an amazing job translating the infamous protagonist to be less cheesy for Hollywood standards when it comes to remakes. With some supporting cast lacking every now and then I still felt the pace kept my attention enough for my to look past those few characters shortcomings. Spike Lee managed to deliver a great interpretation of the source material, and added enough of his own flair to make it fresh for veterans of the original Korean flick. It certainly isn't a frame per frame rip-off.Rest assured most of these hate comments are from fanboys that can't handle someone tampering with their precious original. Is it the masterpiece of the original film? Not exactly, but it's still a great interpretation! Nothing is sacred in my opinion. I'm glad people who wouldn't normally watch a subtitled film will be able to see this great story and through interest give the original a chance! I give it a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An objective review from a massive fan of the original: While unnecessary and obviously suffering post-production drama, Spike Lee's "Oldboy" does have hints of brilliance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2003, Park Chan-Wook's "Oldboy", a revolutionary Korean film inspired by a Japanese Manga, was released. It has since become a phenomena word-wide, with many admirers. And for good reason. It is the rare "perfect film" for many... myself included. In fact, I've gone on record saying it is my favorite film. A beautiful, poetic tale of revenge, masterfully crafted and hard-hitting to the core.In 2013, American director Spike Lee's remake was released. And it was the subject of constant scrutiny and criticism in the lead up to its release. Its very existence angered many fans of the original. And it was outright dismissed by many. To the point that the day of it's release, it was condemned with numerous false-votes from people who obviously hadn't seen it, and it was the laughing stock of message boards. I was one of the few who didn't mind that it was being remade, since to me, nothing could tarnish the excellence of the original. So I went in with an open mind, despite knowing that the film suffered a troubled post-production. A post production in which Spike Lee's director's cut was heavily edited and re-cut by the studio, causing Lee to more-or-less disown the film to an extent.(A quick note: I am going to be reviewing this film as a stand-alone work as much as possible, don't expect this review to be full of comparisons to the original.)The film opens in 1993, following advertising executive Joseph Doucett (Josh Brolin), a crude, boozy man who tanks an important meeting with a client and goes on a wild night of drinking and self-pity to make himself feel better. After passing out, he awakens inside of a bizarre, hotel-like room where he is kept in captivity for 20 years. He learns from the room's television (his only real connection to the outside world) that his ex-wife was murdered and he was framed for the crime, and his young daughter has been adopted. Finally, after completely changing as a human being, he is suddenly released one day with an ultimatum- figure out who imprisoned him and why, or else his daughter will be murdered. He must work together with kind-hearted nurse Mia (Elizabeth Olsen) and his old friend Chucky (Michael Imperioli) to solve the mystery and confront the mysterious figure responsible for his imprisonment. (Sharlto Copley)The cast is wonderful. Brolin is fantastic as Doucett. The contrast between his almost over-the-top early sequences set in the past, against his later brooding, troubled persona in the present is something to behold. He gives the role his all, and it is a grand performance. Olsen is also fantastic, and gives the film a bit more of a grounding, being a somewhat more relatable character for the audience to latch onto as they follow the story of Douctett. Imperioli is quite good as Chucky, but he's not really that developed as a character. So I can't say much of him. Copley is completely unrecognizable as the villain (whose name and purpose I won't reveal due to spoilers), and he gives a really interesting take on the character... almost unreal and even borderline cartoonish at times, yet it somehow works really well and is a great contrast to the Doucett character. I loved Copley's villain, honestly. And supporting roles (including a small performance by Samuel L. Jackson) are pretty much all wonderfully played and a lot of fun.The script by Mark Protosevich is pretty well-written. It hits many of the same beats as the original film, but it makes efforts to differentiate itself and Americanize some of the sequences, which is for the best, since some key scenes from the original film just wouldn't play out the same in America. Although I will have to say, I am critical of how many Asian references are in the film. It felt contrived and a bit like fan service. And I can't help but feel it should have differentiated from the original more than it does, since it does feel somewhat inorganic, and the story moves as though it is on auto-pilot at times.Spike Lee's direction is quite nice. His sense of composition and storytelling serves the written material quite well, and it's very well shot. Though I do have to say it feels a bit derivative. Not because it's a remake, but because the sort-of aesthetic of the visuals and Lee's direction is something we've seen many, many times before. And it does rob a part of the impact.However, that being said, this film isn't bad. In fact, one can see that the vision behind this film is quite brilliant, and it should be one of those rare remakes (like "The Ring" or "The Fly") that is a worthy companion to the original. But there is that glaring issue- the studio-mandated cuts. As the mythos goes, the original cut was 3 hours long, which Spike Lee edited down to a 140 minute director's cut. And the producers/studio system decided to further edit the film, displeasing Lee and star Josh Brolin. As it stands, you can tell that this film is missing something. Because it moves way too fast and doesn't have an organic flow. And it gives the film an unhealthy sense of randomness that hurts the experience. I honestly think that if we saw the director's cut, which runs 40 minutes longer, this would be a more worthwhile experience. Because I can tell you, the main problem here is that fact that we're missing so much material.As it stands, Spike Lee's "Oldboy" has hints of brilliance, which are botched by reckless editing. But it's not terrible by any means, and it definitely doesn't deserve the awful reputation it has garnered.I give it about an average 6 out of 10, and I beg the studio to give us a release of the director's cut someday.</fullReview>

Of coarse, one cant compare this to the Asian original as it was totally different in the whole feel. But if trying to watch the new Oldboy without the consent of the old Oldboy, this is a very decent stand-alone movie with an epic twist at the end. No loose ties.Watch it if you're in for a deep storyline and hit-n-punch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An advertising executive is kidnapped and held hostage for 20 years in solitary confinement, without apparent reason, or explanation. When he is released, he embarks on an obsessive mission to discover who placed him there, and their rationale, only to find he is still trapped in a web of conspiracy and torment.....Let's get the housekeeping out of the way first. The original is brilliant, easily one of the best films to be made in the noughties, and one of the most impressive, visceral and disturbing films made. And obviously a remake was inevitable.The answer to the question 'should the film have been remade?' Is a simple 'no'. But hey it has, and to be fair, it's not a bad movie at all.But it was never going to find an audience who would appreciate it really. People who have never heard of the original, probably wouldn't appreciate the dark tones of the film, and the disturbing narrative, and fans of the original, well, let's just say, it wouldn't be cool to like this movie.Lee has a wonderful eye, and the best thing about this movie, is the camera work, from the faithful re-imagining of the hallway fight, to the flashbacks where both time lines are melded together.Brolin is as brilliant as expected, and whilst on screen, you are thanking whatever you believe in that the makers didn't cast Will Smith, because this would've have been diluted for the mainstream, and he would have sung a song at the end.Copley makes a decent villain, but it does take you a while to get over his accent. It's very Dick Van Dyke by way of Don Cheadle in Ocean's 11.Jackson is good, but seems out of place in this, given very little to do other than dress strangely and swear.So all in all, its a pretty solid remake, the best remake I've seen in a while. If you don't know the original source material or the 2003 movie, give it a go, it's still pretty visceral stuff, and the twist is gut wrenching.I guess I'm not as cool as I thought, I was pleasantly surprised..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think Brolin's act was good. And Olsen's was not bad. Samuel Jackson was entertaining enough, as well as old Moltisanti.Then because it was a remake, I think the director wanted to make it a bit different from the original. So some main factors were changed. Like the reason the antagonist prisoned Ducett for 20 years.And some little factors were erased. To make the length of the movie more compact. Like how obnoxious Ducett's younger version was. And how bad the treatment that the antagonist's sister had when she still lives.Then again, there was a big cultural difference between Korea and US, and that perhaps what made the changes in the movie necessary? I dunno.What I do know is that this movie, is not bad. So to the haters who can not be objective, they shouldn't be heard.</fullReview>

The acting is very bad in this one, and I wouldn't have expected this, because the cast is pretty OK. Also, it's poorly shot and where the script was altered, it makes a too harsh transition to the new scene of the story.All in all, this version cannot make you part of the story and drama. It does not transmit all the emotions available in this story.I would like to say I liked something in this version, but I cannot. Moreover, I found it to be like cheap theater.The film, Oldboy, is a Korean film and that's how I'll remember it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'OLDBOY': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Spike Lee's adaptation of the popular 2003 South Korean cult classic (of the same name) directed by Chan-wook Park. Park's film was loosely based on a Japanese manga series (of the same name) written by Garon Tsuchiya and illustrated by Nobuaki Minegishi (which ran from 1996 to 1998). This remake tells the story of a man who is kidnapped and locked up in solitary confinement for 20 years (in the comic series it was 10 years and in the 2003 film it was 15) and then released, without given a reason why. He spends the rest of the movie trying to find his captors and get revenge. The film stars Josh Brolin in the lead and co-stars Elizabeth Olsen, Sharlto Copley, Samuel L. Jackson and Michael Imperioli. I found it to be intense, involving, very disturbing and a near masterpiece; I haven't seen the original in many years though, so I can't fairly compare them.Brolin plays Joe Doucett, an ad exec who recently separated (on bad terms) with the mother of his young daughter. He's a drunk and not a very likable person. He blows a huge deal by hitting on his potential client's lover. Shortly later he's kidnapped on the street (while he's wasted) and locked up in a prison-like hotel room (in 1993). While locked up he learns that his ex-wife has been raped and murdered and he's been framed for the crime. He spends the next twenty years becoming obsessed with vengeance and making amends with his daughter, Mia (Violet Hill), who's been adopted. Overtime he gives up alcohol and also learns martial arts (from watching it on TV); while getting fit he slowly becomes an effective killing machine. When his captor suddenly releases him (in 2013) all hell breaks loose!I've never read the comic book but I did see the original South Korean movie (the year it was released) and from my recollection this seems to be a pretty faithful adaptation. I definitely can't say if it's any better or any worse (and I doubt it could possibly be much better) but just judging it on it's own merits; it's an amazing film. Brolin is great in the lead (and it's impressive how much weight he put on for the role) and Copley continues to amaze me (with his diversity in roles and pure talent). I'm not a huge Spike Lee fan but I have enjoyed some of his movies (quite a bit) and I think this is possibly his best (or at least one of them). It's great to see Lee really diversifying himself (as well) and doing a stylized martial arts revenge flick (of all things)! I know the studio (releasing the film) cut over 30-minutes out of Lee's preferred version (Brolin preferred Lee's cut as well) and that possibly could have been an even better movie; supposedly the huge central fight scene (involving a hammer) was all done in one cut, originally (which was displayed in the extended version). I think it's a shame the producers lost faith in the film's box office potential (due to it tracking poorly) and didn't release it in many theaters. I was really looking forward to seeing it on the big screen (back in November when it was supposed to come out). I do think it's a near masterpiece and fans of the original should definitely see it!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTUUB4nMD6M</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sharlto Copley seems to have prepped for this movie by studying Gary Oldman in the Fifth Element and them taking that character and making it even worse. The movie takes itself too seriously to support awful acting.It lacks a tightness in pacing, the over-the-top martial arts scenes detract from the story. Josh Brolin is rather believable most of the time. Elizabeth Olsen was believable too, and Samuel L. Jackson plays exactly the same character he has played in every part he has ever played as well as he usually does.I wish they had dropped some of the silliness and sloppiness in the plot, those may play well overseas but American audiences are actually a little more mature about dropping into comic book level reality in grim moments. I think dropping Copley and hiring a director who understands more than one genre may have been the best fix.Oh well, it was worth watching without being incredible, 5 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was an admirable try... but somehow the 2003 original Korean film had a much better feel and presentation. The original is the prime example of a solid script, cinematography, and storyline that should have explored taking the franchise to the next level by spending a little more money and adapted it for an American audience with strategic actor placement that would have given it a more favorable American acceptance without the need for sub-standard knockoff attempt. Hollywood has begun to switch roles with the Asian entertainment markets. I'd say it started about 15 years ago. Asian films are much more vibrant, better production,story-lines, and ORIGINAL. Hollywood and its old formula, cookie cutter models is dying and the only advantage they have is top talent with box office draw in super suck movies. If the Asian markets ever find a way to lock in box office heavyweights to the likes of Brad Pitt, Will Smith, and Angelina Jolie,etc... Hollywood will go the way of dinosaurs and the DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Decent Remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of the 2003 Korean cult-classic by the same name, 'Oldboy' is A Decent Remake, helmed by the Talented Spike Lee. Though its not perfect or as compelling as the original, it still has some genuine merits working on its side. 'Oldboy' Synopsis: Obsessed with vengeance, a man sets out to find out why he was kidnapped and locked into solitary confinement for 20 years without reason.'Oldboy' is grim, bleak &amp; violent. But in comparison to the original, it isn't as violent or grim, which in my opinion, is a minus point. Sure, gore can be ignored, but the world of 'Oldboy' demands violence and utter grimness. However, 'Oldboy' has much going for it too. The film is never boring. In fact, the first-hour is power-packed, delivering gripping sequences with each passing scene. The second-hour loses pace &amp; even the culmination, which completely defies from the original, is disappointing. I feel, the climax should've remained the same. Mark Protosevich's Adapted Screenplay offers strong moments, but the culmination is shabby. Spike Lee's Direction is effective. He successfully creates a sense of paranoia &amp; claustrophobia in the narrative. Cinematography &amp; Editing are worth a mention. Action-Sequences/Stunts are incredibly executed. Performance-Wise: Josh Brolin delivers a bravura performance as the tormented protagonist. The Oscar-Nominated Actor carries the film on his board shoulders &amp; delivers one of his finest performances to date. Elizabeth Olsen is very sincere. Sharlto Copley is creepily menacing. Samuel L. Jackson is frightening in a cameo. Michael Imperioli is okay. On the whole, 'Oldboy' may lack the brutality of its original, but it still towers above expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am not sure why so many bad reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why there are so many extremely bad reviews, OK so the film wasn't the best film in the world but it wasn't as bad as people are making out. It was alright. Then again people keep mentioning that it is a remake, i don't think i have ever seen the original so i can't really say if it is better or not but i thought the film was alright.This film was weird at parts but was interesting... i like films with twists in them but i didn't like the twist in this though, a bit sick. I think the ending did spoil it a bit... i think without the end or at least with a different end it would have been better.I think the film overall deserves a 5 or 6 out of 10 at least as i have seen much worse films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A passable film in it's own right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The recent splurge of Hollywood remakes of successful Asian exports have damaged the credibility of the remake, or the 're-visioning', as some of the more self-respecting directors dub them. It's east to forget that filtering a famous story through another artist's vision can produce great results, and without remakes we wouldn't have the likes of The Maltese Falcon (1941), A Fistful of Dollars (1964) and The Fly (1986). When Hollywood got it's grubby hands on the rights to a remake of Chan- wook Park's idiosyncratic modern classic Oldboy (2003), fans were up in arms. How would this story of octopus-munching and incest translate to an American audience? Then, Spike Lee was on board to direct, and people were as intrigued as they were confused.Josh Brolin is Joe Doucett, a scumbag salesman who repeatedly drinks on the job and makes inappropriate passes at his clients girlfriend's. After another night of heavy-drinking and missing his daughter's birthday, he meets a woman with a yellow umbrella. The next morning, he wakes up to find himself in what looks like a hotel room, but is actually a prison in which he'll spend the next twenty years. Given Chinese food and vodka to consume every day, and seeing the news of his wife's murder and his daughter's adoption on the news, Joe eventually attempts suicide. He is saved, with the aid of his captors, and starts a vigorous routine in which he prepares for revenge. Then one day, he wakes up in the middle of a field with a cell phone and a lot of questions.I'll just establish that I was never on board with this remake, even with the intriguing notion that Spike Lee was to direct. Yet Lee was adamant that this is a re-imagining from the original manga text, so I gave it a go. The many homages aside (the octopus, angel wings, the extended hallway fight), 2013's Oldboy does manage to be a film in it's own right. We learn more about Joe before he is captured, and Josh Brolin gives a strong performance as a character that is certainly angrier than Min-sik Choi's Dae-su Oh. This is evident from a beating he gives a young group of jocks, elbowing and stamping, and Lee's film is certainly bloodier. There is also more development given to the young woman who takes pity on Joe, and is played with a fearlessness by the lovely Elizabeth Olsen.But where Oldboy fails wholeheartedly is the juggling of tone. Beginning with a grainy, hand-held 16mm, the sense of reality is thrown out the window come Joe's release. We are introduced to bad guys such as Chaney (Samuel L. Jackson), who dresses like he belongs in the world of Willy Wonka (is there anything this man will not wear?), and the main antagonist Adrian (Sharlto Copley), a big bad so cartoonish that he may as well be twirling a moustache. In Chan-wook Park's movie, the shifts in tone suited the director's style as well the whole general strangeness that comes out of the Asian movie industry, but here it is handled so clunkily that it often comes off a simply laughable. Anyone unfamiliar with the original must find the whole experience simply perplexing.Ultimately, this isn't a bad effort. I have to applaud it for at least trying to be it's own movie, rather than a carbon copy of a film that was always going to be it's superior. The tweaks and small additions have added little to the story and, if anything, made it more easily accessible. What worked so well for Park's original was it's refusal to abide by the normal storytelling rules, whereas Lee often tries to spoon-feed this strange tale and force it into a conventional and familiar Hollywood narrative. Like the film's protagonist, you can't simply put a story like this into a cage and expect people to enjoy looking at it, you've got to prod it with a stick, let it loose and scare the s**t out of everyone. But thankfully, Spike Lee seems to have finally realised that they're called films, not joints.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak, Safe, and Uninteresting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes are generally a bad idea. The percentage of remakes that are equal to or better than the original is probably less than 1%. However, English-language remakes of foreign films (or vice-versa I suppose) are a slightly different story. The percentage is still low, but maybe not quite as low. Anyway, all of this is to say that while I was skeptical of an Oldboy remake, I was not 100% against it. The benefit that a remake of a foreign film has over a regular remake is that you are pretty much forced to make things different, at least a little, simply by virtue of different tastes and filmmaking styles between cultures. That's a good thing, in theory, because all of the good remakes I can think of changed things from the original. The cookie cutter shot-for-shot remakes are the worst. Oldboy (2013) is, unfortunately, not a good remake.In some ways the movie smartly avoids trying to copy some things from the original that would not fit with an American version. There's no hypnosis, no guy cutting his own tongue off, and no octopus scene. It's when the movie tries to copy its Korean roots that it fails most. I'm speaking particularly of the comedy and action portions, which feature Josh Brolin trying to mimic Choi Min-sik with embarrassing results. Obviously the biggest problem is that the twist that the first movie relied so heavily on is going to be spoiled for a large portion of the audience that will even want to see this one. Worse, this remake seems to telegraph the twist in ways the original didn't. I watched the movie with friends who hadn't seen the original and they all figured out the twist and none were particularly shocked by it. Finally, it ends with the type of bizarre "happy" ending that plays to the worst stereotypes of Hollywood filmmaking.Josh Brolin was probably a weak choice to play the lead. He's not awful but just very unimpressive. Sharlto Copley, however, is terrible. Absolutely horrid. Yoo Ji-Tae was so good in the original film. He gave a sympathetic performance that actually made you feel for his character, even when you're being repulsed by his actions. In contrast, Copley is a completely unsympathetic foppish cartoon villain. To make matters worse, Samuel L. Jackson also appears in the movie in a villainous role and, of course, his huge personality makes Copley appear all the more underwhelming. The only real bright spot in the cast is Elizabeth Olsen, who continues to impress and is definitely headed for bigger things than this. Spike Lee's direction is workmanlike and uninspired. The less said about it the better. Yes it's a poor remake but, more importantly, it's a poor film altogether.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all- tell me what gave you the idea of making such a brilliant movie in such a form? It was like copying from a book in exam with no sense of justice to what you are writing and altering the lines in the most weird and obnoxious way. This movie keel over a lots of things including the script. At one point you would wonder what is so different about this movie that you decided to watch it and then you will realize- it was just to praise the original even more after watching it. Even the director knew this movie is going to be a bomb and he made it just because people can watch the original and praise it even more. From every way this movie is unequivocal to drabness. While you are at it, they try to show you the most important part of the original like the hammer-action scene which took Chon min sik around 20 shots to complete it perfectly but here you would get the feeling like they did it out of hurry in 1 and 1/2 shot because Josh Brolin or may be Spike Lee needed to visit the Toilet. The twist sucks. Sharlto Copley who impressed us all in District 9 triple sucks here after he double sucked in Elysium with his too weird accent which sounded more like a comic relief and less like a deadly villain. BOYKIE YOU WARE DAED. WA AM GOING TO RWIP YOOUR HAED OFF. Man, that sounds too funny to me. Well expect nothing like a difference here and don't you dare to watch this. Try forgetting that a remake for such masterpiece was ever made in this lifetime of yours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake by director Spike Lee was an absolute disaster. The entire movie was filled with unnecessary and meaningless violence. The story did not flow smoothly. I could not feel the same empathy I felt from watching the original movie. Also, I find it not surprising that great actors such as Christian Bale, Daniel Graig, Rooney Mara and Mia Wasikowska have declined to be a part of this movie. I would like to recommend that everyone watch the original Oldboy first then watch the remake.Thank you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never seen 'the original' that's why I can actually review and rate this movie. I find the votes of fans of the original very biased and compromised as they were comparing the movie to the original or worse - to their imagination of how the remake should be like. A comparison of the movie to another movie you haven't seen is completely useless for the viewer.Spike Lee is a magical director. He hasn't failed in any way here. The movie is fast-paced, thrilling, perfectly written and visually flawless. The idea contained in this story is very non-traditional, however, the message is delivered with excellence. It's definitely isn't a movie for easy evening, but rather a journey into the darkness of human behavior and feelings of despair, hate and pain. But mostly, it's a movie that stands out in its depth and that's something that's not easy to get in contemporary Hollywood cinematographic production and distribution.</fullReview>

Especially if you haven't seen the original.I thought Spike Lee did a good job of keeping the original essence of the film and making tweaks to appeal to American audiences. I thought the acting and fight scenes were well done. Why not give this movie a chance? Don't let the purists ruin it for you. It's a well done film, based on a great original idea.If you have seen the original "girl with the dragon tattoo", then watched the remake, I would liken it to that.

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to see a remake of this movie. The original is just great and I was interested to see the whole thing from a new perspective.Unfortunately they ruined it: - they ruined the plot: it's still based on the Korean movie, but they cut out great story lines and compressed other parts of the movie. It takes out all the energy, all the craziness of the plot. - what happened to the great music? The Soundtrack of Old Boy is so beautiful - instead of using it again they made contracts with Apple and Google (product placement sucks) - what about the great twist at the end? The fake daughter thing is interesting but they cut out the whole hypnotic thing which made the original movie so great.To sum it up: I don't get it: you have the budget, you have great actors, you got this awesome plot, this awesome soundtrack and then... you ruin it. 3 of 10 stars: I liked the thing with the mouse family who is served as his meal and I liked some details, like the angel wings weared by the Asian sales lady in the beginning... This could've been such a great remake... :-(</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So quotes (from someone such as Shakespeare) one of the main characters of the OLDBOY remake before he . . . maybe to appreciate this moment, I need to mention that his own dad did exactly the same thing after he had . . . but you need to go back even further to what happened in the greenhouse at the old prep school . . . or maybe start with the other main character, played by Josh Brolin, who's just been tricked into . . . no, as the guy who I think was in DISTRICT 9 says, it's best to be silent about OLDBOY. Better yet, maybe YOU should NOT see OLDBOY at all. Once you've seen something, it's pretty hard to UNSEE it. (Just ask a PTSD sufferer how cheap and easy it is to put visual toothpaste back into the tube of stuff your brain has never encountered.) I know folks who wish they had NOT seen the HUMAN CENTIPEDE. I know older geezers who would like to UNsee THE DEVILS, even decades after exposure. No one can forget LITTLE NICKY, or any of those flicks where body orifices are sewn shut. Some people even take exception to the finale of BRAVEHEART. Be warned: Do NOT see OLDBOY if friends have said you're the "sensitive type," if you have not already prepped by viewing the much tamer ANGELS &amp; INSECTS, or if it's a "weak stomach" day for you. Enough said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Josh Brolin plays a scumbag alcoholic advertising executive who, in 1993, is kidnapped by a mysterious entity and kept isolated in a "hotel room" for 20 years before being unleashed on the world again to face family, friends, enemies, and all sorts of other things.OLDBOY is an interesting mix of low-intensity noir combined with a moving, sensitive, yet still very hard-hitting ending. There are all sorts of themes here; unlike many of its sort, however, OLDBOY does not get so bogged-down in its own ideas that it interferes with the basic suspense of the film. Lots of gore, violence, and sex/nudity, but it never becomes truly tasteless. WARNING: While I don't want to give away the specifics, the big "twist" at the end is shocking stuff that's obviously offended a number of folks. Still, it's not presented in the gratuitous in-yr-face fashion that it might have been and makes for a very true element of surprise. On the other hand, certain plot-details don't make a whole lot of sense, and I'm not sure that they are supposed to, so in that respect, OLDBOY suffers from some lazy production and direction. Nevertheless, it has a very original overall plot with elements of solipsism and quasi-fantasy, all presented in plainly realistic, easy-to-follow fashion. The blank and fuzzy spots should not be completely ruinous if you aren't too demanding. The quality of the acting and filming is generally good if not especially great. Still, Michael Imperioli and Elizabeth Olsen (of "Martha Marcy May Marlene" fame) both give strong performances.Watching OLDBOY, I was completely unaware that it's a remake of a 2003 Korean production by the same title, and there is an overwhelming consensus among the more critical reviewers that this version is quite inferior to the original, which is so often the case. All I know is that, certain elements aside, I found this OLDBOY very compelling and am now eager to see the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spoiler, but you need to know this before choosing to watch this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is the spoiler: This piece of garbage will push crude incest in your eyes. One of the 3 incest scenes includes gay incest, maybe child abuse.And that's the point of the movie. (it also has other flaws).That was a spoiler, but you need to know this before choosing to watch this movie. I wish I knew before I watched it, so I had a choice about what to watch.For example, if you don't want to watch a musical movie, you want to be warned that it is a musical, so you do not waste your money, and feel cheated into watching one.I watched this movie because it was rated 8.5 on IMDb. Now I see that I was confused with the original movie from which this movie is a remake, and was rated so high. I see lots of Korean movies overrated, maybe because they are "not so bad for a Korean movie".My point is not that this is a bad remake. I don't know if this is worse than the original, but I know that the -childish- plot, the point of the movie, is garbage.1-If you rent a movie, you should know what kind of movie it is. For that reason rent stores have XXX sections. If you want that, you go there. If not you don't go there.Not that this is a XXX porn movie. Is not so explicit, but is a movie about incest gore. One of the 3 incest scenes includes gay incest, maybe child abuse.2-The rest of the movie is third class. Like unbelievable fight scenes where the "hero" defeats hordes of enemies which attack one by one, and it feels fake script fight. You don't even feel like watching a bad movie, but a bad sketch which not even pretends to look real.3-Also, this movie is full of the wrong "politically correct" clichés, like showing that the character is a bad dude because is a womanizer, and a drunk which does not care for his family, but it turns into a good dude because is chastised, so he turns into a clichéd model of moral perfection. So, he's the good dude because he's the ideal, sociably acceptable, moral consensus. He turns from one cliché to the opposite cliché, and you should accept it because "everybody knows what's right".That's does not stop him from killing without care. This movie believes that it needs needs lots of murders just as a checkbox to be classified as an action movie.4-And by the way, I guessed the end very early in the movie, and just watched it to see if it was the most obvious end. And it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different take...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think everyone's being harsh on the film, which is probably right, but this was a film that was always going to be hated the day it was announced. The dislike bar on the YouTube trailer was massive. The thing is though, without the original Korean film that wouldn't have been the case. The trailer looked decent. People were just outraged about the fact that it was being made. It had to be made though, it's too much money for everyone to pass up. It still had the basic outline of the original. Which is an incredible story. Whether the story is stolen or not, it's still an incredible story. The acting at times was kinda meh, it made some amazing actors look not so amazing. A lot seemed un-natural and just not believable, but still you can't ignore the story. Point though, is that if the original never existed this film would be rated at maybe around a 7. A lot of the movie did seem really rushed Spike Lee's version probably would take that feeling away, but still in summary. If you're a fan of the original, probably stay away from this one, stick with the original. If you haven't seen either, watch the original, but if you're one of those people who don't have the patience for subtitles, watch this, but I do urge you to watch the original. Whether or not you have the patience, it is definitely worth it.</fullReview>

I watch a movie for entertainment mostly and while this was going in the right direction I ended up hating it above all other films. The acting is good, Josh Brolin is excellent, Samuel L Jackson maybe not so good but hey there's always ups and downs. I ended up after the film with one important question. Why! This is really unnecessary. I almost feel that it should be removed from all film archives worldwide. There is no excuse for a story that follows the premise and ending of this film and this will be the last Spike Lee film that I ever watch. I have ended up feeling disturbed and disgusted that such a film could ever be made. The only film that has ever left me with such a bad taste in my mouth is Irreversible with Monica Belluci. That one I could understand why it was made. This is just not needed. If you are able to watch this and actually enjoy it, I'm glad I don't and don't want to know you. Sick in the extreme.

		<shortDescription>Spike Lee destroys what could have been an iconic remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not yet seen the original Oldboy but I absolutely will be seeing it very soon. I had heard how amazing it was and I saw how angry people were about an American remake. Well I am a movie fanatic who doesn't hate remakes. Some of them have been stunning including Fincher's The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo. The trailer for this looked very promising and I was quite excited about it. I started a week of movie watching out with this dud and it set a low bar for the remainder of the week. This was almost nearly entirely crap and it almost entirely is the fault of director Spike Lee. I can't help but imagine how amazing this would have been at the hands of Lee's nemesis Quentin Tarantino. If he was trying to prove he would have done Django better...he has fallen flat on his face with this. Its a joke. The fight scenes, the pointless close ups of inanimate objects, the poorly edited story, and just Lee trying to make this his own at the expense of the film. The movie opens interestingly and right away you can tell Brolin will be the highlight of the movie. His character and performance is almost excellent and saves this from being complete garbage. Somehow we are supposed to believe that by watching Television locked in a room he has picked up beyond exceptional martial arts/fighting skills. He instantly uses those skills to essentially break and dismember a random group of football players (something he is never pursued for or never comes up again.) It is a horrendously violent scene but incredibly pointless to the story. More on this in a moment.As mention Josh Brolin essentially gives this film its 5/10. Without him this would have been stone cold awful. Sometimes due to a terrible script he overacts a little bit but he's only doing what he can do. He is very good in the part. Elizabeth Olsen who has been on her way to stardom for awhile and is a very good actress is simply disgusting in this. Maybe its the script, maybe its the directing but her character is terrible and campy and delivers her lines in an excruciating way. Her chemistry with Brolin is okay but then there is no development between them. Brolin randomly comes across her (another gaping plot hole) and for whatever reason she becomes obsessed with this random guy who stumbles past her. Its ridiculous and she is not good in her part. Not to be outdone in the worst ways is Sharlto Copley who does his best impression of a villain from a Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon. He is ridiculous and takes a dark, twist, vengeance film and throws in something so campy, over the top, silly that it is literally a comedy performance. He is awful and the character is awful. Samuel L. Jackson shows up in a small role that is underplayed and is made out to be much bigger and more important in the trailer. Michael Imperioli is probably the second best performance in the film. He actually plays a very good role and him and Brolin have great chemistry that is underused in the film.If I had to guess I would say that Spike Lee was so excited to do this movie that he ignored all senses and went for violence and was blinding by his own "brilliance" only seen inside his own head. Oldboy should be a dark, twisted tale of vengeance with mystery and suffering and instead there are parts of this that feel like a comedy. I don't know if he was trying to make the fight scenes pay homage to to the old school kung fu flicks that are cheeky and hilarious to watch but he slapped that style in this movie and it looks silly and out of place. The main fights in the film look like a video game and you can't even enjoy the ridiculous over the top violence that was expected in this movie. Despite two decent performances, this one falls flat and the only other thing I was actually impressed by (and maybe this came from the original film) was the big reveal/twist at the end. Its not the first time I've seen it, in fact I saw it last year in Samuel L Jackson's The Samaritan (which I'm wondering now if its loosely based on Oldboy.) The twist is sick and disturbing and I sort of balked at it at first but then I thought, that is actually an interesting twist to the story. But the three good things do nothing to save the 100 plot holes and terrible editing decisions they made. Pass on this one unless you want to see for yourself. 5/10</fullReview>

All I can tell you is you won't be disappointed at the ending. Its one of those movies that once you start watching it you can't stop because you want to know the big question "Why". Believe me when I say this movie has action, drama, suspense, unpredictability and more. Don't miss it. The movie starts out somewhat slow but gradually picks up pace as it goes on. The movie give time to develop the lead actor John Brolin enough for you to get some idea the kind of guy he is but you have to watch it through to get the full picture of what kind of person his actor is or was. I'm not to surprised it didn't do well at the box office, unfortunately Spike Lee has tarnished his name along with others in Hollywood so its to bad. But regardless you don't want to miss this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going into this movie, the first thing that the audience must understand is that you cannot relate this movie to the original Oldboy. it is a remake, but it does have subtle differences, but the overall movie has its own style.I was pretty excited that they were going to make an Americanized version of Oldboy, I heard about it as it was just being pre-produced. I did have high expectations for this movie, and I was not disappointed.Throughout this movie, I was at the edge of my seat. Hats off to Josh Brolin for playing the main character, he really did a great job. I hated his character in the beginning, but as the movie progressed, I really started to see the struggle that he was going through. Elizabeth Olson is really coming into her own as an actress, I am really excited what she has to bring to the table in the future. I thought she did a fantastic job in this movie, she is really goodlooking too. Sharlto Copley was an interesting choice as the main villain, he has a weird accent in this movie and it is kind of different compared to his other movies, but I like him as an actor overall and was okay in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a review whining about the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oldboy is a remake. Leave it at that and go into it with nothing more than that. Open it to the movie itself.This movie is by no means a masterpiece, however having watched a great deal many bad movies, B movies, extremely low budget movies, I fail to see what everyone else is complaining about.Our story is about a man named Joe, who we learn fairly quickly in the first few moments is rather a bit of an asshole. He has an ex wife, won't attend his daughters third birthday for the very reason she is only three and work is all important, and then when he lands a big deal thanks to the wife of the man who gave it to him....he hits on said wife.And not subtly either. Needless to say, this does not end well and he proceeds to drink himself into a stupor.The next day, he awakens in what I personally consider a rather tortuous room...it's made to look like a cheap motel room from the early 90's (which the movie starts in) but Joe soon realizes is a prison. The mental trauma of being stuck in what appears to be a normal room but you know is not and you can't get out, well....The first third of the movie then shows Joe over the next twenty years of his life and finding out he is framed outside those walls for the murder of his wife. Seeing on the news in a television in his room that his daughter was adopted, he vows to change himself and escape one day.The rest of the movie deals with his search for answers as to why he was imprisoned, who put him there, and to get his revenge and clear his name. It sounds like a typical American who-dunnit movie, however as things are revealed, it becomes clear there is a much darker motive to his capture.For one, the fact he was willingly released the day he tries to escape.Everything that occurs is not exactly spellbinding, and it certainly takes its time to get rolling. It's not a movie everyone will be captured by intellectually by any means, and any action buffs seeing this will be disappointed after the extremely well done and brutal hallway fight scene.However...everything in this movie happens for a reason, with a purpose, even if it doesn't always make sense with the random cuts and jumps in time (very likely due to the heavy editing the studios did to trim the original time down) In the end, regardless, you will be shocked, likely horrified, and almost certainly enthralled and remembering back to everything you just saw in the last forty minutes with a completely different view.And you will likely either love the ending, or if you're extremely jaded, find it just another in a long series of twists.I would implore anyone with any genuine interest in this movie, however, to give it a chance and watch it. Expect nothing, and simply let yourself into the world it shows you.Pleasantly surprised does not begin to say how much I loved the movie.And I'm a huge fan of the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched the movie and I am completely amazed.. The beginning was bad and I felt like it was deserving the rating it got here of 5.6 at this time. But by the time I reached the ending, I was completely shocked. What an amazing movie.People who reviewed otherwise have absolutely no clue what the hell they are talking about. For some reason people always compare a remake with the original, why the hell do you do that? Never watched the original and will probably never do, even if I would watch the original I would never judge this movie compared to it, it is plain stupid to do.I suggest you watch the movie and decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performance by Josh and Samuel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating this movie below 7 will be injustice. Although the idea is not original but it doesn't pretend to be original and Josh Brolin did a great job. Even if you have watched the Korean version before, you will still enjoy this movie and that is what movies are all about.... entertainment.You will love every scene of Samuel Jackson. Samuel has a unique way of swearing in the entire Hollywood and you will love that in every movie.Technology is changing and telling an old story in a new way is not a bad thing. People always want to see the remake of an old hit. I will give 7.5 to this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>first off i hate when people say it was not as good as the original foreign movie, or...it was not like the book, who cares !If you're like me and don't read books or watch foreign movies...i mean I speak English, subtitles,is like reading a book,and I don't read books.This movie was a good movie,It was entertaining,yes no academy awards for this movie,like Schwarzenegger will never get an academy award,yet the guy gives you 90 minutes of good entertainment....like the Ramones or Kiss will never be in the same camp as Beethoven...still they entertain you just the same.the movie had some dull moments and the main character didn't smile much,I mean if 20 years were taken away from you,you'd probably have little to smile about as well. I never seen the original foreign film,so if you haven't seen the foreign version of this film,I think you will enjoy the film,again it's no academy award material,but it is worth a watch.My 2 cents anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2003-2013 a fair review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few month ago my friend suggested me to watch the Oldboy (Olboi 2003). Just in same time the first 2013 Oldboy trailer was released. I had an option to watch the original version, either wait for the US one. Its not a secret that non-European / non-USA movies are sometimes hard to fully understand for due the differences in translation and culture, but took a "leap of faith" and watched the original first. I was really shocked and surprised (like most of viewers) and I truly liked this movie. It was sharp, unique and brilliant. But there are still people who can't accept the fact that "foreign" movies could be made well, but still want to watch something wasn't done before. That's why the Oldboy 2013 was made. And it still sharp, unique and brilliant.The biggest mistake of humanity it's their radicalism. Is perfectly seen by the Oldboy 2013 rating and reviews. US version is shorter but better explained, original is more accurate. Both movies are good, solid and totally delivers the idea.The rating cannot be trusted.Oldboy 2003 - 8.4 Oldboy 2013 - 8.0</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You remember the first time you saw The Transporter, or Taken, or and I know it was just as good so The Transporter 2? That is how this movie is going to make you feel. There are some jaw dropping moments in this movie that just knock you back. Spike Lee&#xfeff; and company should be most proud of this most solid, and well made movie. I had the punchline around two thirds of the way in, but watching it all unfold is still a great ride. The story is tight, and the acting is all excellent. The action scenes are all fast, and incredibly well choreographed, I was cheering for real. Too bad that the Olsen twins got so rich that they just sit around farting diamonds, but Elizabeth Olsen is as usual very good, and she makes up for it. Sorry needed to be said. This movie is so easy to Enjoy that I recommend it whole heartedly to each, and every adult out there. Not for the kiddies, unless you see it first, I promise. This is a bit bloody, but very violent, and there really is very adult content in here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary?...... Maybe Not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sad truth of the matter is that the majority of mainstream America does not watch foreign film - bummer I know. Because in my experience, it is foreign films that generally have the most captivating stories and scenarios.OldBoy is a film I watched many years ago, and it left me with so many feelings. Of those feelings was of course shock at the ending, and sadness with the state of which the main character was left in. It was a film that I wanted others to watch, but due to having to read subtitles or sit through a less than stellar English voice over - few did. Fast forward and here we are with a remake that gives an entire new audience the opportunity to witness this narrative. The acting is solid, it's filmed well, and its extremely close to the original. How is this a bad thing when viewed holistically?I would be so bold to say that I preferred Joe's ending in this film over the original. Remakes will rarely be as "magical" as the originals, but they sometimes offer an alternate take on a well liked story for us that are familiar - and a brand new experience for those that do not care to see the original or are unaware of its existence.If you have never seen the original - watch this film. If you have - give it a watch.... or not :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1993, the alcoholic Joseph Doucett is a hated man with basically only one friend, Chucky , who owns a bar. Joe neglects his three year-old daughter Mia and ex-wife Donna. Out of the blue, Joe is kidnapped and locked alone in a room for twenty years. Along the years, he learns that Donna was brutally murdered and he was accused of the crime and Mia was adopted and raised by a family. Unexpectedly he is released without knowing who arrested him and why. He meets the social assistant Marie Sebastian (Elizabeth Olsen) and his old friend Chucky and together they try to solve the mystery only to find out real mystery was why he was set free."Oldboy" is a excellent remake directed by Spike Lee of the South Korean masterpiece. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil) : "Oldboy: Dias De Vingança" ("Oldboy: Days of Revenge")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After 20 bleak and extensive years of isolation in solitary confinement, Joe Doucett finally executes a perfect escape route only to be released by his capturer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The date is October 19, 1993. After A brief moment of our protagonist being on screen every single viewer most likely would have formed an opinion on Joe Doucett (Josh Brolin) it's only 3:12 PM in downtown New Orleans and Joe is a drunken mess! it's clearly portrayed that he is an inconsiderate, alcoholic slob and less than five minutes into the movie the violence begins, with an abusive phone call when Donna Hawthorne (Hannah Ware) Joes ex-wife calls him to remind Joe he must come to his daughter's third birthday. He rudely rejects in order to attend a dinner with a potential work client, Daniel Newcome (Lance Reddick). which Joe ruins by hitting on Daniels girlfriend. After blacking out, Joe awakens in solitary confinement; a hotel like room without any way of contacting the outside world, just a bed, TV, a basic bathroom and bibles. The first thing the TV shows is a news story on the murder of Joes ex-wife Donna with incriminating evidence pointing towards Joe Doucett. Leaving the daughter an orphan.Joe faces many difficulties locked in this room, his capturer provides him daily with meager portions of Chinese food and a pint of vodka. The lack of socialization, at first ,drives him insane but after a failed attempt at suicide Joe dedicates his life to finding his daughter Mia and getting revenge on his unknown capturer by giving up alcohol and intensively training. Joes friend Chucky (Michael Imperioli) and a nurse that Joe encounters (Elizabeth Olsen) both assist Joe in the identifying and finding 'The stranger' who kidnapped him; Joe goes through extreme measures from slicing throats and disintegrating skulls so he can identify 'The stranger' in less than 48 hours and be reunited with Mia.Joe's journey to find his daughter and regain normality is far from easy. Viewers are left on the edge of their seats due to the extraordinary plots twists and turns.. Will he ever prove his innocence? Oldboy is violent, murderous and nauseating! Its not something I personally would like to view but throughout this movie, I was at the edge of my seat! The suspense in the drama and the astonishment in the brutality, are faultless components for this perfectly scripted perplex thriller. Once you start watching it you can't stop because you want to know the big question "Why?"Josh Broslin's character, at first is infuriating, however as the movie progressed, you really begin to see the struggle that he is going through and fail to sympathize with him. He clearly deems himself determined as he stops at nothing to save his daughter; ending the lives of others and being stabbed in the back are taken lightly by Joe as long as he finds the poisonous intellectual responsible.His fast moving intense relationship with Elizabeth Olsen's character shows the impressive acting skills of the two. Josh Broslin's and Elizabeth Olsen's roles are captivating; and so convincing in their roles that they can hold an audience captive and make them feel as if there is nothing but the story at hand. The jaw dropping memorable scene is the very last one. A relieved Joe presumes everything is over so he can be reunited with his daughter until the serenity is broken with the unbearable ugly truth. You see the contrast of Violence, depression, confusion and love in the acting of Josh Broslin, throughout the movie his constant personality change shows what a truly versatile actor he is by taking on this role and performing it marvelously. Spike lee brings us another action packed and adrenaline filled thriller to our screens. The plot is grandiose and exhilarating! This movie serves great entertainment with its outstandingly executed acting and the plots gruesomely intriguing twist and turns. Old Boy really is an immersion into complete disorientation, corruption and twisted-ness. If you enjoy mysterious, atmospheric and disturbing movies you will love watching this one unravel, it's been 2 years since the release of the movie and it's still intrigues me. I Defiantly recommend you go to any local movie store and purchase this movie. It's worth 2 hours of your time, a must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>so, this may seem to some a biased review, but the theme of the movie and its' execution was brilliant to me. Never been a fan of Josh Brolin, but now I am blown away by his acting chops in this. His Dad should be proud. This movie is totally unique and given the fact that the original is of Asian extraction I can say a "thank you" to the makers for this English remake so that I may watch (and appreciate) such amazing content and "get it". This films unique character has left me breathless and I know that no other film will come close to satisfying me in the same way for a long, long time. KUDOS! Job well done!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll try to keep this short because many others have written bloated reviews raking it over the coals. I had never seen either this or the original so I watched them back to back, starting with the original. I can honestly say I do not understand why so many people consider the original a "poetic masterpiece". I found the characters in the original to be any where from cartoonish to just plain annoying.One the complaint I've read about this version is that Brolin's character is shown to be very unlikeable in the beginning. The point is that he realizes what a deadbeat father he has been, and that his life is worth living if only to see his daughter again.Another complaint people have is concerning "The Fight Scene", and that it is not choreographed or filmed as well as the original. I honestly fast forwarded through half of the original fight scene because it was just repetitive people falling down and ending up in pileups. This on I felt at least had some choreography and I appreciate the fact that the third part of the fight scene was offscreen instead of another 5-10 minutes of the same thing over and over.And as far as the motivation of the villain, it seems to me that someone who was involved in parent/child incest and though it was special, and then that parent attempted to murder him would be messed up enough in the head to take their revenge in such a twisted way. The only part I really disliked about this version was the very last scene where he "admits" himself back into captivity. As weird as it sounds I honestly would have preferred to have him kill himself and go with a complete tragic ending.All in all this is a fairly average suspense/thriller movie. I don't regret having watched it, but I probably wouldn't rewatch it on purpose. And I definitely think that the original is one of those movies that people give extra hoity toity bonus points to simply because it is a foreign film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spike Lee's adaptation of Garon Tsuchiya &amp; Nobuaki Minegishi's Oldboy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Talking to a friend a few months ago about films that he was interested in viewing,he suddenly asked if the US remake of the Korean film Oldboy had ever been made.With having seen some ads for the "troubled" remake,I decided to brush the question aside,and make a note of getting the old boy out of retirement this Christmas.The plot:1993:Getting no answer on the phone from his wife, (who is looking after their 3 year old daughter)and all his pals telling him that its time to go to bed, businessman Joe Doucett grabs a bottle of booze and starts wandering around the city.Spotting a mysterious girl walking round,Doucett walks up to her,and suddenly faints.Waking up,Doucett finds himself in what appears to be a motel room.Getting himself tidied up and all set for work,Doucett goes to the door,which has been locked shut.Desperate to get out of the room,Doucett begins screaming and looking for an alternative exit.Taking a closer look at his surroundings,Doucett soon discovers that he has been taken prisoner,with his sole human contact being the arms of a prison warden,who once a day passes food to him (silently) under the door.2013:Spending 20 years in the cell,Doucett only link to the outside world is a TV,which allows him to watch a program which reveals that he has been framed for his wife's murder,and also features recurring interviews with his daughter.Along with watching the TV,Doucett trains himself with the goal of getting revenge on whoever is behind his captivity.Fainting during an escape attempt,Doucett wakes up in a box,in the middle of a field.Getting out of the box,Doucett sets his sights on tracking down his daughter,and finding out why he was kept in a cell for 20 years.View on the film:Despite production on the film being a complete disaster, (which went from Sony cutting 40 minutes out,and re-editing the would-be set pieces,to director Spike Lee taking his trademark credit "A Spike Lee Joint" off the flick,and replacing with the impersonal "A Spike Lee film")director Spike Lee and cinematographer Sean Bobbitt are impressively still able to hammer the title into a vicious Neo- Noir world.Showing an unflinching eye to the brutal display of violence,Lee &amp; Bobbitt cover the walls in harsh reds to subtly show the anger that Doucett has towards his captors,and also the fury that the lead individual behind Doucett's exile has for him.Whilst the extremely grim Noir ending relies on a huge stroke of bad luck,the screenplay by Mark Protosevich makes this unlikely coincidence one that is easy to forgive,thanks to Protosevich smartly avoiding the option of turning Doucett into an all guns blazing hero,by instead slowly revealing the events of Doucett's past (shot as atmospheric "ghost" flashbacks by Lee) which wraps a heavy chain of guilt around Protoscevich and the main captor.Along with the haunting flashbacks,Protoscevich also uses Doucett's time in the cell to build a gradual feeling of impending revenge being on the edge of bursting out of the box at any time.Giving this hard-nosed Neo-Noir a note of feminine calm,the pretty Elizabeth Olsen gives a very good performance as nurse Marie Sebastian,with Olsen showing a raw feel of anxiety to be creeping across,as Sebastian tries to uncover the events of Doucett's past.Sliding in the titles opening in a slick suit,Josh Brolin gives a fantastic performance as Doucett.Avoiding the chance to show Doucett as a one note street-smart thug,Brolin makes sure that Doucett's pointed one liners are matched by a wave of vulnerability engulfing Doucett,which shows that there is still life in the oldboy yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being leery of remakes not being very good but not having seen the original, I made it a point to see the remake first. Without giving away too much or rambling on like writing a thesis, I'll be as concise as possible. Bottom line, it was a decent movie. It's set in the US but with some far-fetched "foreign film-like" scenarios which, IMO, hurt its believability and getting engaged into the film. Even some of the lead character's reactions in the last half of the film were a little incredulous which also affected the plausibility of the ending which was also one of those "foreign film-like" scenarios. Aside from knowing this is a remake (which I haven't seen) and shares the same title, this was a somewhat obvious retelling of an Asian film using Americans. It was as if the cast of The Magnificent Seven wore queues and went around using samurai swords in the Old West. The movie would have been better served distancing itself from the original and giving it a more American characteristics.I was going to rate this a 4.0 or 5.0 but it got a 6 for having Josh Brolin who did a good job with the material given.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falls just shy of being as good as the original, but still a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as remakes go, this is one of the best I've ever seen. One might argue that the original is too new and excellent for a remake to offer any improvements over it - and there's some truth to that - but even if this film is just an Americanized version, as a standalone film it's still brilliant.But, it's a remake, so let's compare. If you've already seen the original, then you probably are not going to like this one as much. Chan-wook Park is such a talented director than even such a prolific name as Spike Lee cannot really top him when it comes to film making. The original 2003 Oldeuboi has better cinematography, camera angles, music and colours than Lee's effort. It also has really jarring iconic scenes, which Lee doesn't even try to copy - though there are a few respecting nods towards them.But as far as comparisons go, I'd say the actors are pretty much equal. I think I prefer Min-sik Choi over Josh Brolin as our protagonist, though just slightly. Then again, I think Elizabeth Olsen is a better female lead than Hye-jeong Kang, though again just slightly. The supporting casts are pretty much equal, with varying differences.The one thing where I found Lee's effort to be superior is storytelling. Park uses the film medium better. His film looks and sounds better, but Lee's plot flows more smoothly. The way Brolin's character moves and is manipulated from one scene to other feels more logical and believable, whereas some of Park's plot twists do rely more on willing suspension of disbelief. The whole hypnotism explanation, for example, which is absent from Lee's film.Then again, Park's ending is more bitter, and thus more suitable for the overall tone.I honestly think critics have been too harsh on this film. It's a beautifully dark mystery thriller, still contains one of the most mind-blowing reveals in cinema history, is well-acted, well-directed, well-shot and all around pleasing to watch. It'd be interesting to know whether the critics dismissed this one because they kept remembering how surprising the original had been, and were subconsciously expecting a similar mind bomb, even though they already knew how it was going to end. Would people prefer this version if they saw it before the original?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is better than the IMDb rating.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ratings for this movie seem to be ratings mostly based on comparison of the original, and the same goes with the reviews. I've read where people stated that a remake was not necessary, which makes no sense at all. If anything, this movie could be a reason to go back and watch the original -since you may now know there is an original. No one promotes a movie a decade old. Don't let all of the reviews stop you from watching this film. If you do decide to watch the original first, and don't mind reading subtitles, you will see a great movie; however, you may have a negative experience of the watching this film because you may be expecting to watch the same movie. It's not the same movie, and does not have the same actors. Just like many others, in 2003 I had no idea Old Boy was ever made - it being Korean and all. Also, many people don't like reading subtitles, mostly because you have to take your eyes off of the action, and keep them off to keep up with the dialog. And as person who watches a lot of movies with subtitles, that can be a little distracting; however, I'd take subtitles over voice-overs any day. I had no idea a remake was being made when I saw the original in early 2013. One day I wanted to watch a movie on Netflix, "and since I don't mind reading subtitles", and have seen a few great Korean movies, I thought I'd give Old Boy (2003) a shot (read a review that said it was a good movie). In my honest opinion though, the original is better, and that's largely because of Choi and not so much of the other better acting. However, this movie in not terrible like some others have stated. If you've seen "I Saw the Devil", and the original "Old Boy", you would know that Choi is a great actor. I give this movie a 7. To me, that's a respectable rating. I would not give it a 2 just because I think the original is better, but I would, and probably did, give the original a 9 -mostly because of Choi's acting. The story is still good, I had forgotten a few parts of the original, so this was a refresher, and it didn't bore me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch The Movie. It's Worth It!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't understand why this film has got such a low rating here on IMDb. Guessing that this rating reflects many peoples reaction to the director, not the movie. "Oldboy" 2013 is a very good film, haven't seen the original, didn't feel it was necessary. Film stands on its own. Acting by all involved was really good, writing, cinematography was also very solid, and the ending was so unexpected, a surprising twist to say the least. Bump all the negative reviews and shamefully low rating. Ignore the haters and watch this film. Going to watch again to see any details I may have missed the first time. Will also share with others via social media. It's even on Netflix streaming now (June 2014). I may even go buy a Blue Ray copy. Nice job Spike!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good remake and a nice film if you haven't seen the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like this remake, I think Spike did a good job of remaking this movie and making it his own. I have zero issues with the violence and gore, I do wish he didn't change some things from the original but Josh Brolin KILLED this role! Excellent job!The fight scenes in this one are awesome and Samuel Jackson's role he played (he did a good job as well)was one of the nice touches and additions that Spike make and don't take away from the film. I really can't see why anybody would complain about this movie, it's a remake and actually a good one because the original probably could NEVER be redone better, but Spike does a real legit job with this one! I give a 8 no problem</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oldboy - American style !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading the overwhelmingly negative criticism of Spike Lee's remake of the Korean iconic classic, finally after watching it, I was impressed and engrossed. A fan of Korean cinema, I was sceptical of what this film could offer, in truth nothing that we didn't see in the brilliant original but this was suppose to be a tribute, a remake and nothing more. When watching this as a stand alone movie with Josh Brolin and Elisabeth Olsen, it was brutally impressive with top performances from a star cast. I didn't concentrate on what this 'Oldboy' should have been but focused on what it was and that is a Spike Lee entertainer which sticks close to it's Far East masterpiece predecessor. This was a difficult task from the outset due to the unconventional story line which may be accepted in Korea but not in mainstream Hollywood. This was a harder job than what Scorsese had when he re-made 'Infernal Affairs' with his 'The Departed'. Yet I think Spike Lee did an admirable job and the cast were superb with an ending that yes, was even better then the Korean one!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only if you don't compare.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This could never have been the 'OldBoy' everyone was looking. The obvious question is, did the original call for a remake? I suppose not. Specially because the entire structure of the movie weighs heavily upon a single point. And with the global exposure that audiences have today, there was absolutely no shock value this new version offered. Wonder who this version of Oldboy cater to. Anyhow, distancing myself from the obvious comparisons, I think Spike Lee's Oldboy is not as doomed as it's made out to be. Obviously, if you copy the 'famous fight sequence' and then fail to match even half the standard it set, then you are in for a bashing, but to be fair it was too hard to live up to, not just the sequence but the entire intensity of the original. So, Oldboy 2013 is decent because Josh Brolin puts in a credible performance. Also, because for the very limited space Shalton Coplay had, he put in a very original take on an otherwise not so original movie. Elizabeth Olsen again was quite decent, to be fair, save Josh Brolin, no other character was explored sufficiently, so they never stood a chance to shine. And for Sameul L. Jackson, he leaves his mark alright, totally ruins the torture scene. Now, you don't stand to lose much if you give this one a miss, but watching it isn't all that bad either. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a patch on the original but a solid movie regardless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming out 10 years after the now revered 2003 Korean classic by Park Chan-Wook, Spike Lee's Hollywood remake of Oldboy was meet with much critical disdain and equally lacklustre box office performance upon release that we can now on paper call this venture an out and out failure that failed to find an audience or do anything of significance that made it stand alone on its own merits. While not reaching the heights of the unique original Spike Lee's film is actually a very solid attempt at translating the original film and features enough visceral scenes of violence that it will linger in the memory without striking an emotional punch.With a strong cast led by the baulking Josh Brolin and the ever impressive Elizabeth Olsen hype for this Oldboy remake built up some strong hype and in that respect the actors do deliver on the promise there names gave the picture. Brolin is a strong central figure in the mystery and violence of the film and his transformation from drunk arrogant businessman to focused on revenge one man army is believable while Olsen is equally solid as the caring stranger Marie Sebastian. Others in the film bring the piece down with particular mention needing to be made of both Samuel L Jackson as a ludicrous villain (complete with bad hair and dress sense) and in even more ludicrous form Sharlto Copley as the mysterious "invisible man". Copley completely hams his role up and needed much more control from Lee to stop him going so overboard with a role that would of worked out much better as a straight up take, but then again the feel of Oldboy as was with the original is one of an almost fanciful nature.There might not be any sea creature eating this time around but Lee's version of the warped tale still features a hammer heavy fight, a nice cooked 'mousey" meal and a chilling one take sweep of a household tragedy that makes the movie at times chilling and at times creepily compelling. It's in these moments that the films mysterious centre comes out to shine and there is no denying that at the core of this blood filled tale is a story that works on many levels and would take a complete butchering to ruin.The wow factor of Spike Lee's Oldboy will be dimmed for those that have seen and loved the original but overall this is still a fine incarnation of the story that works on levels many films fail to reach. A bitingly funny, blood curdling violent and deeply disturbing tale Oldboy is undeserving of its bad wrap and worth seeking out especially for those yet to experience the originals wild charms and for Lee personally its one mighty step up from the dribble that was Miracle at St. Anna.3 and a half dumplings out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A homage to a legendary film ......Does it bring anything new?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As has been said countless times through various reviews - this remake was completely unnecessary and did not bring anything else to the table. However if this had been a completely original film I am sure it would be scoring in the high 8's I, as many on here had already seen and loved 2003's oldboy. A massively original film that brought feeling and emotion to a very twisted and dark tail. Is this film better....no? Does it bring anything new to the table ..... no? Is it still watchable and enjoyable ..... YES especially if you have not seen the original.Josh Brolin plays Joe, essentially one of life's ass-holes. The film opens with us meeting Joe and expands on the character more than the original with some nice if not over the top touches. After a drunken night out Joe wakes up in a locked room and is locked up for over twenty years. He then has to find out who locked him up and why .......Telling you anything more than that would certainly ruin the movie.I found Josh Brolin to play Joe well as we were able to see various emotions and physical differences and various points through the character ark. Always looking tough enough to handle himself. Everyone else just about played their parts well enough even if Sam Jacksons part was camped up comic book style.I think Spike Lee lost his own style of directing here and whilst amicable that he tried to bring a new style I think he should have molded both his style and the original films look as apposed to the slightly dull look he gave this film.I was looking forward to this film a lot - I loved the original, love spike lees previous films and thought the trailer showed a level of sheen and a new take to the story. Sadly it fell slightly flat.If you haven't seen the original would I recommend seeing this? Yes I would. It is still an excellent story and delivered well enough to enjoy and keep you guessing.Im guessing Spike Lee watched the original and loved the film enough to pay homage as apposed to milking the cash cow - and when people are saying it didn't need a remake at least now the story will be brought to the masses that sadly wont touch subtitled films.To summarise - there is not much new here, acting can be a little hammy and over the top but that is what the film is. A few extra minor twists along the way - but if you really want to enjoy the story see the original</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lurid, bloody and sometimes excessive revenge movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I've been thinking about it for the last 20 years." I had no idea that this was a remake/revision or restyling of a Korean cult movie from 2003. When I read the opinions quickly, all the art-loving movie audiences are outraged and say it's a useless, failed, and terribly bad version of the original movie. May well be, but then again I have the advantage that I've never seen that Korean version, and probably never will see it. I don't like Asian movies that much. Mostly they are technical abominable looking creations with terribly nervous little Asians who are running around all the time. And there is the insurmountable language gap so I am obliged to look at the subtitle all the time. I've already tried to watch an Asian film and notice that I always end up with a sore thumb because I'm pressing all the time the rewind button.And besides, the original movie by Chan-Wook Park is actually a movie version of a famous Japanese manga. In fact, Spike Lee's version is also a reinterpretation of the same comic. Eventually, this "Oldboy" turns out to be an outright duplicate of the Korean version. There are some explicit scenes left out and apparently the denouement got a slightly different interpretation. Besides, I don't understand why you would watch this remake when you think that the original is so divine and matchless impressive. I have the same issue with the Swedish film "Män som hatar kvinnor" which I think is sublime. I don't think I'll ever watch the U.S. version "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo", because I foresee that I won't approve of it. Is it possible that if you watched the U.S. version of "Oldboy" before the supposed masterpiece from Park, the result could be that perhaps you would appreciate both ? Seems to me that it's a foregone conclusion that this movie wouldn't do justice to Park's version. What if the U.S. version would be directed by Steven Spielberg with Will Smith starring in it (seems that was the initial plan) ? Would that be okay ? Scheiss Egal ! Ignorant, unbiased and as neutral as someone from Switzerland I started watching. Josh Brolin is Joe Doucett, a divorced alcoholic who lives in a self-destructive way. He's a representative who must close a deal successfully. But his obnoxious, drunken behavior ruins it all and he ends up in the gutter. Eventually he wakes up trapped in a cell that has the appearance of a hotel room and discovers that he's accused of the murder of his ex-wife. He's eventually imprisoned for a very long period without awareness of the reason. As time goes by, he overcomes his alcohol addiction and he trains his mind and body to attempt an escape. Twenty years later, he's suddenly released and he plans to find the responsible who has done this to him and take revenge I admit that the build up was pretty confusing and I repeatedly had the tendency to turn it off. The reasonable long period of his incarceration made it look like an art-house film with the metamorphosis of a person in captivity shown painfully slow. The claustrophobic images, anger, helplessness, sorrow, rehab, the sometimes frenzied and insane behavior with images that were shown in different positions and perspectives, weren't signs that this would be an exciting and action-packed movie. But after this section a lurid and insane put together story began that eventually degenerated into a kind of Oedipus tragedy. Shortly after his release, Joe eliminated an American Football team in a highly effective and cold-blooded brutal way. What started was a "Quentin Tarantino"-like spectacle , with no-nonsense explicit violence. The fight scene in the corridors with a large gang was extremely meticulous imaged with a smart choreography . I re-winded it three times purely for pleasure and because it was fun. Sure it felt like a revived Bud Spencer movie , but that made it more fun to watch it all. I actually grinned and laughed about it.Josh Brolin was perfectly picked out for this role. The drunk marginal figure that turned into a bloodthirsty Kill Bill in 20 years, was played in a convincing way. The final denouement where he comes to realize how the fully developed plan was put together and where he made the decision to give up his freedom, was masterfully and convincingly mapped. Samuel L. Jackson was also perfect as the sadistic business manager of the obscure little hotel. However, Copley didn't impress me as the ailing Chucky.The only not so realistic thing I could think of in this ingenious and surprisingly put together story, was the fact that he mastered a martial art in 20 years. Agreed, he had time enough for it, but I don't think you can learn these fighting techniques by just watching a television broadcasts.Conclusion: a lurid, bloody and sometimes excessive revenge movie with a perverse denouement (a remark made by my wife) with an impressive Brolin in the leading role. For those who think that Park's movie is unmatchable: cherish it whatsoever. Perhaps a Park adept would look at this one in a different way if he hadn't seen Park's version (as mentioned before). For me it was an original and unusual movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was it horrible, no. Was it great or even necessary if you've seen the original? No</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>while not really a fan of Spike Lee, I will admit to enjoying this film. that being said, does it measure up to the Korean remake from the Chan- wook Park revenge trilogy? probably not. technically by itself it's an interesting film, Josh Brolin does a good job of making you not like him early on as is intended by his character, Olsen I think does have quite a future on the Indie circuit in future film. The problem stems from those who have seen the original and know what's up. So the Big Reveal at the end of the film is not all that surprising nor shocking to us. other issues i think are 1. the big fight scene in the warehouse. though decently executed, a bit unrealistic given Brolin's stiffness throughout the choreagraphy of the fight. Second would be the Man who locked him in the room for 2 decades. It was unnecessarily twisted, as the original wasn't a bit twisted. yet this version takes it waaaay over the top on the why part. even though a twisted character, I'd say Copley plays it rather well, he oozes with creepiness in this role and you do wonder what his next move would be condsidering he shows lack of morality and boundaries in his quest for revenge- all in all- not a great remake but not a horrible movie by itself.

		<fullReview>This film was one of the worst directed and produced movies I've ever seen. The guy is imprisoned without natural light for years, yet his look never changes. He's supposedly malnourished, yet is ripped. It looks like they had 2 days to film all the imprisonment scenes so they just put a fake wig and beard on for a few takes and then moved on to the next. Someone never bothered to research what happens to a person physically and mentally after being put in isolation for extended periods of time. Other times it seems like they don't know how to ease from one scene to the next so, it's like "cut- next scene". The flow of the movie is bad. The acting is fine for the most part. The huge fight scene is Jackie Chan -esque which doesn't fit the mood of the picture. I'm so glad I only rented this thing. Don't waste your time or even a dollar on this.</fullReview>

Twenty years later he is released and sets out on his quest for answers and revenge. I recently watched the original and I have to say that one was very good but very graphic and had ideas that I was interested to see how it would translate in the US version. This one for the most part stayed pretty true to the original but it was very toned down in terms of the violence it showed. The main difference I couldn't look past between the two versions was that this one came off as very flat. The original had a quality to it that while graphic and shocking made you care about what was going on. This one seemed to lack all of that and I think because it was "American-ized" too much. Even the twist seemed to lack the impact of the original, but I think that may have been because I knew it was coming. Overall, not as good as the original. This one just felt flat.

Some "items" such as phones and such seem so blatantly placed they are probably product placement. Iphones, macbooks, using Shazam on a iphone ext.There are top name actors in this film and sadly it could probably have been good if it was just executed better. Some scenes feel rushed lacking quality even from Samuel L Jackson.Mediocre piece of film compared to the original masterpiece.

The problem with the movie was its execution. It felt way too rushed. There was no breathing room. The character development and relationship weren't good. Also, the shock value of the ending was reduced a lot because of some changes and acting. The original ending was BRILLIANT. Action was cool and brutal. Not as good as the original but still good.

		<fullReview>Oldboy is a contorted revenge saga based on a Korean predecessor of the same name. The original is a revered classic which enjoys cult status; therefore any attempt at a reimagining would seem destined to go downhill.The premise follows Joe Doucett (Josh Brolin), a crass business executive with low morals who is abducted and imprisoned for two decades, bereft of any explanation. The film chronicles how he comes to terms with his solitary confinement and plots to seek redemption against his anonymous captor. His ordeal is assuaged by Marie Sebastian (Elizabeth Olsen), a clement nurse who aids his search for answers. However, unbeknownst to Doucett, the path to retribution is layered with climactic twists and turns at every step where he learns that revenge may not always be a dish best served cold.The limited success of the movie lies in the actor's abilities to channel authentic emotions in outlandish situations. Brolin, Olsen and particularly Sharlto Copley deliver resounding performances. Brolin is impeccable as the anti-hero, giving arguably the best performance of his career. The narrative allows him to illustrate a variance of emotions, ranging from recklessness and repugnance to rage. Prior to his incarceration, Doucett is an obnoxious scoundrel with zero accountability. However, once he flees his confinement, he is determined and hell bent on retaliation thus ensuring a compelling 180 degree turn for him.Elizabeth Olsen is impressive in her delineation of a vulnerable young girl, despite having insufficient screen time. Nonetheless, she delineates plenty to leave a mark. However, the saving grace of the movie is Sharlto Copley, chief antagonist who orchestrates the entire exercise. His portrayal of the pantomime villain is blood curdling and insane in equal measure. Despite appearing late in the movie, Copley leave a lasting impression.The remake pales in comparison to the original and otherwise as well, owing primarily to the direction of Spike Lee. He fails to appropriately adapt the peculiar plot, which works only sporadically throughout. For instance, Lee's inadequate execution renders a comical vibe to scenes depicting violence and gore. Another example is that the duration of the two decade long seemed rushed; perhaps signifying that important footage was left on the editing floor.A bizarre premise involving the central figure facing a twenty year stint in a motel room warranted skillful direction, which Lee fails to provide. Ultimately, even though it lacks the flair and spark of its predecessor, Oldboy works well on occasion because of a fascinating premise and themes of karma, isolation and hatred.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not seen the Korean original of this film, so cannot comment on the extent to which director Spike Lee reworks the material. On its own terms OLDBOY has a fascinating premise, with a rather unattractive leading man Joe Doucett (Josh Brolin) being incarcerated for twenty years, and then suddenly being released into a dystopian world of contemporary New York, strongly reminiscent - in terms of ambiance - of Martin Scorsese's TAXI DRIVER (1976). Desperate to find his way in that world, he clings on to two sources of stability - a young medic Marie Sebastian (Elizabeth Olsen) and his childhood buddy Chucky (Michael Imperioli), who runs a local bar. However he discovers that he is being manipulated by an eccentric billionaire Adrian (Sharlto Copley), who not only imprisoned him in the first place, but sets him a challenge; if he succeeds, then Joe will be a free man, if he fails, he will die. Up to this point OLDBOY has made some trenchant points about the nature of human freedom in the contemporary world, as well as asking us to reflect on whether any distinctions exist between external reality and the realities we see on the television screen. Sadly the last third of the film falls apart, as director Spike Lee seems too concerned with wrapping up the various lines of the plot. The final confrontation between Adrian and Joe is strongly reminiscent of the climax of a TV whodunit, with lots of information being imparted by Adrian in a very short time, much of it implausible. Nonetheless OLDBOY does have its virtues - most notably its lurid cinematography (by Sean Bobbitt) and tightly paced structure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the original Korean movie 10 years ago when it first came out but don't remember much about it now except for the key to the plot and a few images which stuck in my head. What lingered are the feelings of and about the protagonist. The loneliness, the anguish, the hankering to solve the mystery of his imprisonment. These are the strongest of all, stronger than the hatred or the vengeance.The colors and the images of the 2003 movie were so extraordinary, that I feel that I could still smell the room, the grass, and the snow. The opulent green and the exuberant red marked the new era of Korean film for me. It was remarkable.When I sat down to see Spike Lee's, I didn't try to compare it with the old one. There was nothing to compare -- I was going to watch it as I watched The Departed, which I deem a completely different movie from the original. Besides, I don't remember any details from it anyway.What bothered me was not just the acting. All of the characters lack some depth which connects the audience to the story.The father is so flat and dumb there's left nothing to feel for him. He rose from an ugly fat drunkard to a pure muscle man who can kill everyone coming his way, but he did nothing to redeem himself from being a despicable person all along, nor did he show any of his internal feelings that would make one understand his nature. His relationship with the girl hardly transcend the pure physical and I couldn't be any more indifferent to their tragedy.I think people need stories because we as humans want to share feelings and experiences. Through these recounted events we are able to experience something new and something familiar at the same time. That connects us with the others, and with our past selves.This film, however, failed in every scene that may incur a complex feeling. There were only conditional reflexes: pleasure -- or disgust, depends on who you are -- upon vengeance; appreciation of someone gentle and caring; warmth and comfort towards a loyal friend; then there's nothing much more. Even freedom didn't seem precious at all.What can I say? I'll give it 5/10 if I consider it an American movie, or a 4/10 if I consider it a Spike Lee movie.</fullReview>

Who?The elements that could make a suspenseful movie are there. The opening and initial minutes are intriguing, then it is all downhill from there.A sense of rush cannot be evaded. 20 years in a few minutes simply do not cut it and when the captive finally escapes, the old Hollywoodian formula of one man superhero who overpowers a small army of thugs even when he gets stubbed deprive this film of further points reducing it from a tense crime thriller to an action movie.From then on, I sat semi impressed waiting for the climax and it did not let me down.

Judging the film solely on that alone makes their reviews seem redundant to me, personally.If you've read the Japanese manga by Goran tsuchiya and watched the chan~wook park film, then you should know that this film does it's best to blend both of them together whilst adding it's own interpretation on the revenge story.Some of the characters such as the main villain(sharlto Copley), his teacher, his best friend the bar tender and as well as Josh Brolin himself are based on the characters in the manga, more so than ones in the 2003 Korean film. So it's no wonder most people don't recognise them from the original film. But this is what makes it refreshing, it's called a remake for gods-sake.(A FEW SPOILERS)Am really glad they took the manga approach to this film. Sure a few things are missing that would have made the film easier to understand. For example how the relationship between josh brolin and Elizabeth Olsen progresses so fast. In both the manga and original film, it's through hypnosis whereas in this film it's quite subtle, you're neither told nor shown what it is that brought these two people together; except the lady with the yellow umbrella has something to do with it. Who i think should have played a bigger role, as the hypnotist rather than a bodyguard.If you've read the Japanese manga then you know the reason why he's locked up is because he took pity on the villain(sharlto Copley)whilst he was singing a certain song. It's pretty confusing and hard to understand. As far as reasons for ruining a mans life....well it feels a bit pointless.Whereas the 2003 Korean film, chan wook park, decides to pervert the ending. Citing the reason he's locked up is because he saw the villain and the sister engaging in incestuous relations.The remake ending is actually better than both the manga and the 2003 film. It gives you a better understanding of why the villain(sharlto Copley) is driven to do what he does, his family, especially his father and sister. This to me is a far stronger reason to lock someone up for 20 years and mess with them psychologically.A few scenes like when he finds an escape route. His best friend getting his tongue cut out. The attempted rape scene. All these are unnecessary and have no part in the movie at all.Overall i liked this remake and i don't say that at all about re-makes. It's that good and i would recommend reading and watching both original film and manga before watching this film to fully grasp it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leave Oldboy alone it should have remained Korean it doesn't work in an American setting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spike Lee's adaptation of Oldboy by Korean director Chan-wook Park is I must say terrible but I say this with a small caveat. If you have seen the original don't bother with the Americanized version you will only leave frustrated. Now keeping that in mind if you haven't seen the original or hate subtitles go ahead and watch Spike Lee's adaptation. The story of Oldboy is about a man who is kidnapped and imprisoned in a hotel like room for 20 years for no apparent reason. Now the room is a standard hotel room amenity wise he has a toilet, a shower, a desk, chair, bed, and a window with 2 rotating images every twelve hours a day light view of a farm and a nighttime view of a farm. Joe the main character played by Josh Brolin Is kept there for 20 years now here is one of the major differences that I didn't appreciate. In the original the Joe character is fed the same dumplings and rice every meal for his entire imprisonment where as Spike Lee's Joe gets gas station burritos and all manner of other food in addition to his dumplings. This may seem like a minute difference to harp on and normally I would agree but the dumplings end up functioning as a major aspect of the story. That is how Joe finds the confinement facility when he gets out because he ate nothing but the same dumplings for 20 years he goes to every Chinese restaurant in town trying their dumplings till he finds the right one. Now in Spike Lees he does the same thing but it just doesn't have the right feel and having Joe eat other food even if it is every now and then makes it feel like a lesser sentence than the original. Moving on the subject of the imprisonment there was one change I actually really felt added a lot I wont describe it but here it is has to do with the mice. You will know what I am talking about if you watch the Spike Lee version. Spike Lees version was host to a few more major changes that I felt totally ruined the movie. In the original there was a strong hypnotism element that they chose to exclude in the American version because they thought American audiences wouldn't buy into the hypnosis. I found this truly appalling the idea of the movie is that this guy gets kidnapped and held against his will in a creepy hotel sort of prison and you think I am going to believe that but be like wait there is hypnosis that's ridiculous NO WAY. Also the removal of the hypnosis drastically alters the story in my opinion. Spike Lee made some other alterations to the villain's back-story, which also had a major effect because it is directly involved in why Joe was imprisoned. Any way enough of my gripes, lets get to the Action, Acting, Story, and Visuals. Starting with action the Oldboy story has solid action it's got a whole lot of fights including one in a parking structure, which I found very enjoyable. Acting was very solid I am a big fan of Josh Brolin he is very good at disappearing into the character and overall has great acting chops. Elizabeth Olsen was a girl named Marie who ends up being Joe's love interest/partner, which is a key part in the movie Olsen, did a great job acting but there was just zero chemistry between the two actors. Sharlto Copley who plays the villain did a fantastically nuanced creepy performance I really enjoyed all his screen time other than his back story. Story I already addressed I love the original story because it is so odd and interesting to think about but with Spike Lee's changes I feel it ends up looking like a cop out. A lot of the changes I felt were made because the film makers didn't think that American audiences could handle it; which is fine in my opinion but then don't make the movie. Visuals were very striking I enjoyed a few it was a lot less stylized than the original which I really didn't like. One last thing before my Overall there is a two flash back sequences of Joe's time at a private school, which I found laughably bad. They were totally unrealistic and poorly done they made the school seem like it belonged in an American Pie movie rather than an adaptation of a Korean film. Overall Action 3 out of 5 stars Acting 4 out of 5 stars Story 2 out of 5 stars original 5 out of 5 but with the changes the story fell apart Visuals 2 out of 5 stars not nearly as striking as the original Final Judgment 11 out of 25 stars full fail not worth your time</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unrealistic and violent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched two remakes (including this one) on the same flight. This has me thinking about remakes of foreign films, and why Hollywood produces them.I've noticed in the reviews for this movie ("Oldboy") that some critics are panning this movie because they don't see it as good as the original. A few of them are quite outraged. I'm also surprised to see that the original Korean movie ("Oldeuboi") has a quarter million reviews and has garnered a really good score. Some reviewers call it a "classic" and assume that every reader has seen the original. But I'm asking myself: If this original Korean movie was so popular and so good, why didn't I see it? I've never even heard of it.Does the film distribution network explain why I missed the original Korean movie? I usually only see movies released in the Netherlands. However, distribution is not necessarily the only issue. Even if "Oldeuboi" had played in theatres in my city, I would probably not have seen it. Subtitling is an issue, of course. The writing and dialogue are hugely important, and much is lost in translation. But subtitling is not necessarily the issue. I go to subtitled movies regularly.I have to admit that I cannot remember the last time I went to an Asian movie. Or any truly "foreign" movie. It seems I don't really have much interest in movies from certain parts of the world. Going further, I probably would have skipped "Oldeuboi" because I'm not that interested in Korea. To me, seeing a movie from a country I'm not interested in is too much like sitting through a National Geographic documentary. (By saying this, I'm not saying that only American movies are good. The chauvinism and Hollywoodism of American movies are often off-putting.)If I had noticed this movie in the theatres, I would have thought that "Oldeuboi" was a violent martial arts film. I would have passed on that basis alone.Quality plays a role. I think the main reason is that I am reluctant to spend money on a possibly dodgy film. I automatically see films from much of the world as potentially boring and a waste of money. Of course, if a movie is truly good, I will see it. However, I don't trust the rating system for these movies because I think that the people that see this kind of movie tend to over-rate them. For example, I'm resentful of the quarter million people who would give a Korean torture film a score of 8.4 on IMDb.com. OK, back to "Oldboy". This is a very dark movie about an alcoholic loser who is mysteriously imprisoned for 20 years. He is fed every day and has access to television. He can do nothing to get out or to kill himself. When released after 20 years, he is (understandably) a changed and very unhappy man. He looks for answers, and discovers that he is the target of a wealthy psychopath's twisted revenge plot.Josh Brolin (who is always good) played his role really well. He's looking pretty good for a 46-year-old. There was some artistry in his depiction of an alcoholic oaf and what it was like to be desperately trapped. The character portrayed was loathsome: a man with no inner life and few redeeming features.Everything about this movie is contrived and unrealistic and melodramatic and overly violent. The whole idea of a complicated revenge plot lasting more than 20 years is ridiculous.(However, I don't necessarily need realism. Science fiction appeals to me, for example.) The movie is disturbing and too dark for me. I wish I had never seen it. There is a gruesome and graphic torture scene in the movie. I'm debating whether this was necessary, although it does fit into the plot. In any case, I don't want to go to movies with scenes like this.And yet I certainly wanted to find out who did this to Joe and why. If this is how movies are to be judged, I have to give this movie a 5 for engagement. I'll give it another point for Josh Brolin's performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The story doesn't make sense under the US culture...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original title of Oldboy, Korean version, is a remark of the deep yet twisted side of East Asian culture. The story of incest, fist violence, anti-humanitarian, children sex and rape works and has some dark attraction under the light of an Asian story background.These elements work because Asian cities are much more crowded, therefore the stress in these areas led to the development of brutality, selfishness, and desperation for sex. These cultures are unique to Asian culture, and simply not attractive to American.Historically, Asians accept rape culture. Rape is legal and morally accepted in all Asian countries until 50 years ago. Having sex with teen around 11 or 12 years old is very common and still popular in Asia today. Removing these cultural backgrounds making the movie simple seem weird and awkward. To void such weirdness and awkwardness, the direction have rewritten the original story to fit American culture but at the same time reduced the dark and twisted atmosphere of the original title.Apart from the storyline, the character development and the fighting scenes in the movie are unattractive. The main character seems trying to behave like a "badass" but coming out as a mid-age 9-to-5 dad tried to pretend to be a criminal. The "daughter," who has been removed the Asian submissiveness and youthfulness, lacks of the convincing argument being a "play doll" - instead it's easier to see her as a overly trusting human. There is a big difference between who is willingly to be submissive because of the cultural brainwash and who is just dumb.Lastly, white people really can't pull off the creepiness Asian actors and actresses can pull off. If the main character was portrayed by Johnny Depp and the "daughter" was portrayed by Chloë Grace Moretz then it might be a different story.</fullReview>

It is so easy to judge something that we have not done or that maybe we think we are not capable to do it. This remake is just full of judgments and took the best part of the Corean original film. When people talk about incest, the first thing you imagine is abuse, not love. That is why I really liked the original film. It is even better the ending when he can not to deal the awful true and prefer to be silent forever,This new American film is just full of stereotypes, and could not rescue the essence of the original story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a huge fan of the original, which is probably my favorite film of all time; I can honestly say I rather enjoyed this. The original was 1000x better, but this was a nice homage to that. I felt like this was just Oldboy 2 rather than a remake, as everything from the plot line, to the character, to the time he spent inside, to the things he did inside were just completely different. The only thing that was really similar was a guy was put in a cell for a long period of time and released to try to find out why and then the ending. Otherwise, it was a completely different film. Copley was my favorite part of it. I really wish they would have changed up the ending, since they changed up everything else. Long story short, watch the Original first as it will punch you in the gut so much harder than this; and then give this a try. 7/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Violent, bloody &amp; brutal remake of the South Korean gem.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes remakes don't work (Let Me In being a case in point), but every now and again a remake, reimagining, or retelling of a previous film comes along that stands up in its own right. Spike Lee's remake of the 2003 South Korean original, Oldeuboi, itself an adaptation of a graphic novel, is a brutal, sinister film of true horror that, if not quite hitting the horrific depths of the original, plunges low enough to be an honorary peer. Forget Oldboy is a remake and try to see it as its own film.Joe Doucett (Josh Brolin) is kidnapped, framed for a vicious killing and kept in solitary confinement for twenty years. His cell is a bland room, his kidnapper never reveals his/her face, no reason is given, no ransom requested and his life of solitude for two decades includes frequent bouts of psychological and emotional torture. Upon his release, Joe seeks revenge for the anguish, loss of life and estrangement from his daughter. In a state of turmoil and following a mysterious figure, he stumbles into a queue for homeless health care and into the life of Marie (Elizabeth Olsen), a damaged volunteer who sees their suffering in common and endeavours to help him.Joe metes revenge swiftly and pugnaciously to all who block his progress and, though the violence is at times stomach churning and relentless, Oldboy is entertaining in part because of it. Though the violence is never as beautifully choreographed as that of The Raid, there is often a balletic quality to it that elevates the brutality above mindless thuggery. Nevertheless, Oldboy is not a film for those of a delicate disposition. Whereas Oldeuboi focused more on the depth, the reason, the characters, Oldboy concerns itself far more with the method of retribution though it steers just the right side of wanton violence depicted in the endless Saw saga.Despite that, the principal characterization is still enjoyable to watch. Brolin seizes the viewers' attention with a smouldering volcano of suppressed rage that explodes without compunction or regret, but his Joe is beautifully tempered by Olsen's Marie, who has her own daemons to exorcise. If Olsen clambered out of the shadow of her famous sibling twins with 2011's Martha Marcy May Marlene, Oldboy has completed this year's campaign of four films to cement her place above them and the forthcoming double whammy of Godzilla and The Avengers: Age of Ultron should grab the attention of the masses beyond the viewers of 'arty' and quirky films.Sharlto Copley, as 'The Stranger', is an unexpected pleasure in Oldboy. There are moments when he veers towards the realm of pantomime villain but his presence both lightens the tone and plunges the film into depravity. If he's not careful, he may force me to reconsider the verdict of him I expressed in this month's Open Grave.There is plenty wrong with Oldboy for those who embraced Oldeuboi and Lee has made numerous changes or steered the story into new directions that will annoy fans of the original. Why, for example, is Joe imprisoned for twenty years rather than the fifteen of the former version? Why is there no follow up on Chucky (Michael Imperioli) after he has served his purpose? While there is much to enrage some, for those who are able to see this as a separate film, these are minor issues in a movie that perhaps more closely resembles Only God Forgives than the South Korean template.Oldboy is sinister and frequently jaw tightening nasty, but there is plenty to enjoy and sufficient to question and discuss after the event, though it's probably not the best date movie of the holiday period.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spike Lee Tackles Revenge.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can an American remake of a Korean film that deals with some pretty intense and disturbing stuff be more sick and twisted? The answer is yes, but that doesn't make this Spike Lee directed remake any better.Joe Doucett is a drunk, a terrible husband and father, he can't even close a deal without being slapped in the face for his behaviour. All this stops once he is abducted and thrown into a hotel make shift prison, where he spends the next 20 years locked away. Randomly, he is released, now he must find out who released him and why. Why mess with something that isn't broken? That's something that runs through my mind. Why remake a film only a few year later, as was the case with Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, just to get American audiences who are too lazy to read see a movie? Whatever the case may be, we have OldBoy. Now the question remains, does the film live up to the original and does it stand on its own ground? The answer is no on both counts. Brolin is the lead and does a pretty admirable job as a man who must fight personal demons in order to overcome his troubles. He is thrown into a modern world, not knowing how to use the internet or the newest apple product. He does have a new set of skills though, 20 year locked away gave him a purpose and now he is no longer the fat drunk he once was. He's a lean, mean fighting machine and we have a carbon copy of the infamous hallway one take to prove that. Granted this addition seems out of place and simply there to be a nod to the original, it was nice to see an effort put in, even if it does fail in comparison. The young lady who aids in his quest to find the man who has imprisoned him is Elizabeth Olsen. She continues to impress with each film and brings some humanity to this film, which seems devoid of any. This remake fails to make me believe their relationship at any point though. That's one thing this film fails at miserably. I never bought character relationships and I didn't feel like he was on a journey to discover his captor. The man who has imprisoned him is Sharlto Copley. He has a very disturbing a troubled past and the man who is left is damaged beyond belief. Samuel L. Jackson has a small role as the man who runs the hotel. He plays his usual swearing self, complete with mohawk. This isn't a Spike Lee Joint, instead it is a Spike Lee film. Does this mean he has matured? Who knows. His version of OldBoy lacks flair, emotion and for those who have seen the original any genuine shock. Lee does manage to make the film more disturbing with some flashbacks, but that doesn't make the film. I can say that the film WAS indeed, better than I had anticipated. It's not lazy and it tries, it just doesn't hit any of the notes it needs to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this film without expecting anything. With an open mind I was pulled into the plot and there is potential.. Which never seems to develop further and ends with an anticlimax - while you cannot really identify or associate with the subjects feelings of purposes.The character development is poor. You cannot get a sense of justification for the rage of the main character: you don't feel his struggle. You don't feel his pain - you only kind of "get it on a intellectual level". Nor you really get into the romance; it doesn't really develop deeper, and the "near gangrape to romantic loving night in the hotelroom" seems very unrealistic and emotional conflicting.The "hot killer Asian babe" is more of a sexpuppy who cares for her partner but gets sliced without really any reason. You feel sorry for her instead of achieving the cliché "hot and cool killing machine which is a great danger and needs to be terminated!". They also brush over the murder of his "college buddy and bartender".Too many clichées for a really bad plot. I left the film thinking; "so the root of this film is the guilt of incestual desire ? With a few shock scenes thrown in. Which really backfire.In all, the plot and story seem to have a lot of potential. Yet the realization, while well ambitious, doesn't get above amateur-level and doesn't surprise nor is refreshing nor is compelling nor entrances you and makes you feel with the character. This is 10 bucks wasted, and this movie will disappear in a few months without anyone remembering it. As it should.</fullReview>

I didn't like the fact that everything is happening in America. If you want to remake something, make sure it is better or at least hugely different, not simply worse. To end this; only two things sound good in the movie: 1- Haeng-Bok 2- when Adrian said: People believe whatever they see on television.respect to all. Looking forward for more efforts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resonance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen King once wrote that the primary asset a great story should have is RESONANCE. I cannot and will not speak for others who have expressed their opinion of Spike Lee's remake of "Oldboy", whether positive or negative. Nor will I endlessly pontificate about how this 2013 film compares with the 2003 version (which I both saw and loved and by the way was not a 100% interpretation of the manga that inspired it). I will, however, tell you how Lee's film made me feel. It is implausible, messy, gratuitous, and a bit silly at times (I doubt Shazam could identify an obscure prep school theme song so readily, but maybe that's just me). Nevertheless, I will state unequivocally that this incarnation of Oldboy WORKS. I have viewed countless films throughout my young life (33 years) and even more so since streaming technology has made them 5 times as accessible to me and if I am still considering a film and its emotional effect a week, let alone day, later, I can say that the film worked on a gut level that is impossible to dismiss and worthy of my praise. The need for human redemption caused by the carelessness we sometimes adopt without being fully aware of it, the desire for connection with others, human or otherwise (the scene where Joe loses his pet mouse, ironically a captive just like him, I found surprisingly touching), and the sense of sadness that unfolds throughout the story (sadness to me is best exemplified by actions that could have been avoided but in the end seemed inevitable similar to the climax of Lee's "Do The Right Thing") These are the themes that have drawn me to the cinema, time and again. They are also why I write this message board today, which I rarely do. The film works, enabling me to remember it and to study its many layers and to find inspiration in not just its characters but in the film's desire to reach hearts and minds. At this it succeeds admirably. It resonates!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing and diabolically fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been years since I watched Chan-wook Park's film that pretty much took 2003 by storm, everybody was talking about Oldboy, I remember that much. I remember watching the movie and it felt like I needed a thicker skin. I don't know if Park would be flattered by this remake and I may be alone on this but I think Spike Lee did it justice in terms of maintaining how disturbing, how chilling and unforgiving this film is. Revenge that turns into redemption. At times, it even gets diabolically funJosh Brolin in this film carries that quiet Charles Bronson-esque persona, he's bent on one thing and one thing only, too bad they didn't give Brolin's character, Joe Douchett, that Dae- su Oh crazy big Asian fro, but that would probably be distracting and it would end up be the only thing of Josh Brolin that people would talk about. Scripted by Mark Protosevich whose body of work includes The Cell, and I Am Legend. Protosevich seems synonymous with a story about one lone character trying to get to the bottom of things, figuring out why he or she is the one getting screwed by the world. With OLDBOY, I feel that Protosevich and Spike Lee focus more on inviting the audience in on Douchett's investigation rather than trying to copy the Korean film or the manga comic frame by frame. I don't remember how much help the lead character received in the film, but in this OLDBOY, lone Douchett suddenly finds himself being assisted by Michael Imperioli and Elizabeth Olsen and also the magic of internet. I find it quite difficult to like Elizabeth Olsen's character, Marie Sebastian, to me, she's not a strong female character, she's more or less a victim that has become a stray dog, and is incredibly clingy. But I'm highly impressed with Sharlto Copley who has played a villain in movies prior, but what he puts on the table here in OLDBOY is one for the books, there's something charismatic, something magnetic about his character Adrian, and yet you just know that he's the kind of person you should always keep your distance from. I even sense a bit of Hannibal Lecter in Copley's cold, articulate and manipulative performance. It's the side of Copley you'll enjoy and fear at the same time.Without spoiling anything, OLDBOY has enough twists and turns to keep you guessing at every moment and get you shocked. Just like the original, this film deals with issues that may cause discomfort and I'm not talking about the violence, which is quite the watch for those of us fans of such films The Raid: Redemption. Spike Lee doesn't waste any precious time, he wants Douchett to get to his targets, one by one, and then you as the audience expect Douchett to do his worst. Lee and Brolin did a fantastic job with the years where Douchett was held captive, the state or condition or the physical transformation that Brolin put himself through in order to bring you this beaten down Brouchet is nothing short of remarkable. Excellent job by the production design, that little prison motel room was well staged, it's like it has a life of its own, it plays a significant role in Douchett's road down to madness and up to soberdom. Along the way, you'll be amused by bits and piece of humor at the expense of 20 years gone by, just like Captain America trying to adapt himself in the modern world, but for the most part, OLDBOY never loses sight on its agenda, it's investigation, it's violence, it's revelation, those three are the formulas for this one hardcore of a revenge film, that is OLDBOY.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Horrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything about the movie was horrible, except Josh Brolin. He was casted and acted perfectly. Other than that, just a garbage movie. The movie had no direction at all, I felt like I was watching outtakes throughout the 2 hours. The fight scenes were the worst I've ever scene. You know cheesy Chinese fights where 20 guys attack one person with kung-fu, but they only attack one at a time, this was it.The movie is being sold-off as a revenge flick, but in the end, there wasn't much revenge. There was no gore. Remember the trailer where it looks like Samuel L Jackson is going to get his head cut off, total bs. Nothing really happened. In the end, I thought an episode of CSI was better directed and scripted than this total mess.I feel bad for Sharlito Copley, he is a good actor in district 9 and the A-Team, but this movie made me laugh at him. His mustache in this movie looked like it was drawed on with a grease pencil and his acting was worse than an episode of "Day of our Lives'.Spike Lee is like a 50/50 director. Unfortunately this time, he might have made the worst movie of his career.I think they should have taken the imprisonment for 20 years and escaping story line and thats about it. If they would have made a revenge flick with just that story, it would have been a million times better.</fullReview>

This film is the most illogical, inconsistent piece of crap I have seen in a long time. In one scene, the hero can fight off 20 strong guys single-handedly (like int he old Ninja movies) and in the next, he can't defend himself against 4 of them. Things happen that the villain couldn't possibly have known or predicted. The ending is absurd. Just don't waste your money. Wait for it to come out on DVD and then buy the movie next to it!

While imprisoned he learns that his wife has been murdered and he has been framed, and he starts getting cryptic messages by his captor so he can uncover the truth and get revenge. In his quest he meets Marie (Elizabeth Olsen), a caring young woman who will risk her life to help a stranger.At the end of Joe's quest he might find justice, but the truth behind this sick game might be even worse that he could ever imagined.The performances are very solid, the ambiance is as creepy as it could be, the end will be shocking and devastating for the characters and the audience alike.Thefilmmakers have provided a good thriller with amazing performances, especially newcomer Elizabeth Olsen who has really proved she is incredibly talented.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Proud Remake?Trashy and Compelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's Interesting when the Usually Hyper-Divisive Director Spike Lee steps out of His Comfort Zone and Makes Movies that are Genre Pieces. Here He does a Remake of a Well Loved 2003 Korean Film of the Same Name.A Word about Remakes. They are Inevitable and can be Irritating. But it does not mean that a Remake can Always be a Bad Thing. Unless, that is, if it is Something Like Psycho (2003) that is a Shot for Shot, Line for Line Copy that Serves Absolutely No Purpose and Causes More Harm than Good. For those that Whine and Complain that Spike Lee has Blasphemed and should be Stoned to Death, Consider this.Virtually No American Moviegoer (and that may be a gross underestimate) will ever See or even Consider Seeing a Korean Movie, even if it is one of the Country's Best. All the Raving on the Web and in Cult Magazines about the Merits of the Original Movie will Remain in the Bubble of the Fringe. It Could be Argued that People will go and Seek Out the Original Only because they see this Remake and They Never would have, Without This.Standing Alone this is a Fine, Ultra-Violent, Edgy, Neo-Noir with a Killer Ending. The Hallway Fight Scenes are Unrealistic, once again, and are Completely Ridiculous and Almost Removes any Suspension of Disbelief as it Unfolds in a Cartoon of Super-Hero Invulnerability. But that Nit-Pick Aside, this is Compelling Trashy Cinema with a Great, if Borrowed Story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard Oldboy was going to be remade, I wasn't too happy. I felt like the original did everything right, and there wasn't any room for improvement. Turns out I was right. This remake has a few cool stylistic touches, but is just not very good. First of all, I'm not a fan of Spike Lee at all, and this film only solidifies that. It has some really terrible directorial choices that make the film seem unintentionally funny at times. Brolin is good, but has a few moments where I felt like he was lacking. Elizabeth Olson is pretty good as well. Sadly, Sharlto Copely gives a very strange and not so good performance. I love him, but this character is just strange. He's a flamboyant British guy who comes across as some kind of knock-off bond villain. Samuel Jackson gives a pretty weak performance too. I liked a few of the additions and a few visual things, but the film just ends up feeling weak and completely pointless compared to the original. Watch this if you really are interested, but i'd recommend the original instead.</fullReview>

Josh Brolin is genius, Elizabeth Olsen is gorgeous and brilliant, and finally Sharlto Copley is superbly diabolical.I am not a great of Spike Lee, but I found this film wildly entertaining. I cannot compare it to the original, as I have not seen it yet (although its on my list) but I truly enjoyed it. Ignore the haters, which let me say I am extremely tired of people complaining about American remakes of foreign films. I only speak English and honestly, watching a movie with subtitles really lessens the experience. So for everyone out there that thinks watching foreign films somehow makes them intellectually and morally superior ? it doesn't. Definitely worth the watch, and much more deserving of a much higher rating (I gave it a 9).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Spike Lee did this ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked Spike Lee's with Do the Right Thing; but even more Jungle Fever and thought Malcom X was OK but not extraordinary. After that I saw a few others I liked and others not so much but never really disappointed until this mess.OLDBOY (the Korean original) is a quite complex tale that could only be believable because of certain small details and a really twisted ending. Lee's version, changed many of those details making the events more far more difficult to accept and forcing a politically correct ending on an absolutely sick story.Even worse is the acting. Josh Brolin lacks any expression or charisma or anything that can make you root for him. Sharlto Copley is a little better but her character was changed to a clown. In fact is a little difficult to find it threatening. Elizabeth Olsen is the only exception. He gives an great sweetness to her character that becomes quite sensual in his sex scene with Brolin. It is a pity the changes from the original left her character loss on the end.The problem here is not the comparison with the original (which is a masterpiece) but that whatever they tried to do here was a misstep. In brief; do not lose any time with this; a couple of good scenes do not make a movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, i have watched the movie Oldboy (2003) and really liked it so i had to watch this movie too and i was not disappointed at all.I will use the term new ,to indicate the Oldboy movie made in year 2013.I was very skeptical at first ,since the Korean movie really appealed to me, the characters,setting, acting, story... i really felt close and connected to the characters and their feelings. From the first minutes of the new Oldboy, i could tell that i would never be able to get the Korean version out of my head and have the same connection and feeling i had to the character Oh-Dae Su, for Joe Doucett but does it mean that the new movie is bad? Let me answer this question right away, NO! This movie is great. The story is very good, the acting is outstanding and the atmosphere is phenomenal. It's just that you don't forget the first time right ? ;) You watch Josh Brolin and you also have the image of Oh-Dae Su in your head so your brain gets into a conflict. You expect to feel the same sensation you felt while watching the 2003 Oldyboy and yet you feel something else, does it mean that the new sensations are less in value or lower in quality? No they are just different and both are excellent in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just...don't...do this remake thing...subtitles are your best bet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Are subtitles so hard for western audience to utilize? Oldboy is a story told in Eastern ways in an Eastern locale. Specifically Korea; which is unique and also a perfect canvas for this, heretofore, gritty, movie-magic dialog. The original story is contained and extracted there, not here. Chan Wook Park, through total, uncompromising vision, nailed it the first time. To adapt it to a western setting is simply absurd. What's next? A new release of the Mona Lisa in MTV sporting a pierced lip? spandex? See the original. Hollywood has no idea how to conceive Asian cinema. Another dumb-down of great film. Spike, stay continental...Asian is not the new black.While this film does carry some of the drive of the original and has technical quality, it's just a shadow in comparison. Don't get started on the vengeance trilogy Hollywood. Surely failure will befall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now first thing is first I absolutely love the original it is my favorite movie of all-time. With that when I heard of a remake i just wanted to kill someone. And then Spike Lee was attached. I have never been a Spike Lee fan but in order to get a feeling of the movie I watched about 5 or 6 of Spike's movies. If there is one thing you can say about his film making it is that he has a very dark undertone to his movies. I drove 7 hours to Portland to see this movie on Tuesday night. A couple of things stood out while I watched it. 1. This movie is BRUTAL. The violence is almost over the top but never to much. Think of I Saw the Devil. 2. Josh Brolin kills the role. I couldn't have seen another actor put themselves through what he did for the role. 3. The movie lacks the emotional feeling that the original leaves us with. It almost feels like something lacked in the script. 4. The story is basically more or less the same until the 3rd act. The bottom line is that no one could ever remake the movie to come close to the original. That being said Spike and Josh gave it a decent shot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Preface every sentence here with 'for me'):This isn't a remake, it's unintended parody. It's very badly paced. Everything about it feels rushed and half-assed, from the acting to the awful, boring score to the editing. When you combine an overstated, overacted narrative with that, you have the makings of a bad film. Congratulations to the lead antagonist for making a very interesting character zero-dimensional. Brolin's only slightly more believable. Nowhere near evoking the response in me that Choi Min- shik did. His acting in I saw the Devil is what finally prompted me to see Oldboy, and it's definitely one of the best pictures I've ever seen. These performances on the other hand can't be blamed on anything other than a mix of bad acting and worse directing. The action sequences had me cringing, and they were the best part of the movie. I'm giving it three stars since there's some production value, an OK synopsis and of course the brilliant script. As bad as I thought it was, it's just an opinion. This movie was still well worth making, if only to expose a larger audience to the original and to show how rare and great it actually is in most aspects. Some are bound to enjoy this a lot more than I did, etc, etc.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If the Hollywood remake of Oldboy was never going to live up to the standards the original Korean masterpiece set, it really shouldn't have been made in the first place. And even if I let go the comparison &amp; try to see this film without any prejudice, it still remains a terribly crafted thriller that was a torture to sit through. Making slight changes to its plot, Oldboy tells the story of Joe Doucett who was kidnapped &amp; held hostage for 20 years in solitary confinement only to be later released by his captor.Less a remake &amp; more a parody of the original, Oldboy fails on that front as well. Direction by Spike Lee is a big letdown, writing is even more stupid &amp; there is almost nothing that works or connects with the viewers for the entirety of its runtime. The film tries way too hard to shock, is in too much hurry to reach its conclusion, thus skipping any character build-up at all, &amp; fails at everything it was trying to do to finally come out as one of the worst remakes ever made in world cinema history.Every decision made in the casting ends up being a wrong choice here as the characters are completely undeveloped, the performances are simply forgettable &amp; the main antagonist turned out to be the definition of 'douchebag'. The only consolation comes in the final moments where the film deviates slightly from the original in depicting the fate of the main character after he has uncovered the secret but on an overall scale, this film is one absolute trash from start to finish that fans of the original must skip. You've been warned.</fullReview>

Of course, if you haven't seen the movie yet and you're not sure if you want to see this movie and want to know more about it from the "layman's point of view" without all the fancy shmancy smarty-pantsie movie buff stuff then keep reading so you don't waist 104 minutes of your life like I did; unless of course you're like me who had nothing better to do on a Friday night but be a cheap date with an old friend and extremely grateful it only cost me $2 to see this movie and even then I wanted a refund!*** Still spoiling ***The trailer looked intense and I was really excited to go see this action movie gone a rye and find the answer to why did they lock this hottie up? Come to find out it's this billionaires sick and twisted game of revenge he plays out on a bully from his teenage years. If you're into incest and think that you can "romanticize" the idea of that kinda of "love" then this movie is for you. Otherwise skip it and be thankful you stopped reading this at the first mention of incest.**** Can't stop spoiling yet ****Halfway through the movie I was thinking what's up with this nurse chick and why is she so interested in Joe, the main character. Since this has to do with conspiracies of someone who could actually afford to keep a man locked up and away from the world for 20 years, make a homemade movie on a made-up TV set designed solely for one purpose, this movie begs you to stay until the end to find out the why of it all.***** If you got this far down this review then you know it's all a huge SPOILER ALERT ****I knew this guy was locked up for 20 years so the first opportunity of flesh being presented to him, freely, you just know he's going to take it! And take it he did! I had a feeling that he should have resisted and well folks, he didn't. He didn't hesitate and the little ex-junkie couldn't wait to find a "daddy" so to speak to fix that "itch". Sic! I know, huh? I mean Bruno Mars's banging like Gorillas has nothing on this daughter and pop duo, sic! You see these two get busy with their pretty bodies and you think awww how wonderful they get to enjoy themselves but then come to realize later in the movie, it's major EWWWW and I almost threw up! I felt so sick of what I had just seen and putting two and two together makes you realize, OMG!!! Why did I just sit through all that. What's done was done, I had been a witness to this travesty and led by the nose of "guess who" and this is why not knowing who you sleep with is a bad idea.I couldn't wait for this movie to be over and I resisted leaving early because what is known to be taboo was presented in a way that it was oops oh by the way we're related! So backwoods and inbred hatred come to mind but at the same time, what can you do? I was tricked in to an action movie with a major plot twist I had no idea was coming. Well done Spike Lee, which is why I gave it three stars out of 10 stars.The action on this bad boy was so violent that it's a wonder why I haven't gone berserk myself, fueled from the hatred and need for revenge and vengeance! The fact the fight scenes were somewhat laughable in a psychotic kind of way, I will never look at my box cutter the same way, nor salt for that matter, lol. I was so happy when that Asian chick got her throat slashed close to the end because she's just as f'd up as the crazy billionaire scum. Anywho, not bad for a $2 whore of a movie and stale, slightly burnt popcorn. This movie taught me a lesson to NOT see a movie without researching the reviews first!***** You have now been spoiled out my reader! Now go see it for yourself if you are brave enough to "experience" it yourself and get down right spoiled on ;-) *****</fullReview>

Yes, the bad guy is he Brolin himself, for what he did as a teenager, or is it the mastermind of the whole scheme, who only seeks revenge?I will finish by telling how surprised I am to see that Spike Lee directed this film. It is not really the kind of stuff he made twenty years ago. See what I am talking about?..

		<fullReview>Oldboy (2013) *** (out of 4)Josh Brolin plays a man who is kidnapped and held captive for twenty years. Once he's released he sets out to discover who kidnapped him and why. He also wants to connect with his daughter who he hasn't seen for all these years and prove his innocence in regards to her mother's murder. OLDBOY is a remake of a fabulous 2003 Korean picture of the same name. I'm sure all those "remake haters" out there are going to hate this film even without seeing it but director Spike Lee actually manages to do a very good job. When I heard Lee's name attached to the film it didn't make too much sense to me but it turns out he was perfect for the job. The film has a very 70s grindhouse look to it and I thought Lee did a very good job at keeping the thing extremely dark, at times over-the-top violent and best of all it's rather sleazy. As with the original, this remake deals with all sorts of twists and turns in the story and if you thought an American film would go easy on the some very dark and perverted subjects, well, then you are wrong. The film manages to throw out all sorts of twisted bits and Lee really manages to hold everything together in regards to the story and the pay-off is just terrific. I also wasn't too sure on Brolin going into the picture but he turns in the best performance of his career. The "monster" or loose animal he becomes after twenty-years is perfectly captured by the actor and the way he makes you believe he really is this killing machine was terrific. Even better is the way he actually makes you care for him and his vengeance. Elizabeth Olsen plays a woman who befriends Brolin and she too does a very good job, although her character isn't nearly as well-written. Michael Imperioll is very good in his supporting role as is Sharito Copley. Samuel L. Jackson turns in another Samuel L. Jackson performance but he's still fun in his own way. The movie is a pretty dark little tale but there are a few brief moments of humor that actually helps. There's also a terrific action sequence where Brolin's character must fight dozens of people on his return to the warehouse, which is a classic sequence full of great laughs and violent action. OLDBOY doesn't reach the same level of the original but fans of 70s grindhouse pictures should really enjoy it as long as they go in with an open mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't see the original Koreon movie and i don't intend to because i don't like Korean movie's with the subtitles and all. My opinion about this movie is that it is not very good. Why you may ask? Well it is my opinion that the fighting scene's are weird and i had to yawn a few times during the movie, which is usually a good indication that it was taking too long. The end however was pretty good. Why did i give such a high rating you may think? Well that is because the actress Elizabeth Olsen has the perfect boobs. There is 1 scene where this is clearly evident. I will not tolerate it if someone disagree's on this matter. It may only be my opinion but in this case it is more then just an opinion because they are really perfect. When you see it you will understand or not and i can only pity the ones who don't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Josh Brolin is excellent in an otherwise not-so-good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After further consideration of this movie, it's rating is increased to 8. This is because the movie has elements in it that are quite good - the man trapped, unjustly accused of a serious crime, subjected to forces beyond his control, struggling to maintain his sanity, struggling to maintain his emotional equilibrium, the theme of the pointlessness of revenge, the search for the truth, and the risks involved, and the question of personal responsibility.This movie is all build up with no climax. It entices the audience, then lets the audience down. It offers huge doses of violence and sex, but does not deliver. Where does this movie go wrong? The acting is good, the cinematography is excellent, outrageous acts occur, yet the movie is flat. The principal character, played by Josh Brolin, is not likable; in fact, he is detestable. Although one can empathize with the main character's plight, still it is also reasonable to feel that being stuck in a box is exactly where he belonged. The story is bizarre and what happens to the main character is extreme, but the story conveys no sense of injustice. Also, the story ends with a certain twist that is unconvincing. There are also scenes which are outright campy, e.g., the action movie cliché of one person demolishing a small army of extremely violent men. To expect an audience to accept that scenario is asking a bit too much. The movie includes graphic sexual activity, which actually figures into the story, yet the movie remains tepid. Unjust treatment can be a source of powerful and compelling drama. Victimization of the innocent is something that can grab an audience's attention. When the weak are preyed upon and the strong abuse their power, that can provoke powerful feelings. This movie is not about any of these themes. In fact, it is a challenge to figure out exactly what this movie is supposed to be about. True, the story line is uncomplicated, but the underlying subplot is mushy, which trivializes the main plot. A man kidnapped and imprisoned should evoke all kinds of feelings, yet in this respect this movie fails. That is, the elements of a compelling story are there, but they are not combined to make something dramatic. That is too bad because Josh Brolin gives a remarkable performance, and his performance is an example of how a skillful actor can rework even the most mediocre material. Brolin's performance rates a 10; the movie overall rates a 1; 11 divided by 2 equals 5.5, round that off to the next highest number, hence the rating of 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm gonna be up front and honest. I've never seen a Spike Lee film and I've never seen the original. Knowing that the original had such high acclaim this film had huge shoes to fill. People keep saying that this film is unnecessary which is stupid because most films that are made today are unnecessary, they obviously wanted to put a new look on an acclaimed Korean story and I appreciate that. The story was very interesting and kept me guessing throughout its entirety. Josh Brolin is a great American actor who pulled off his role as Joe really well. The antagonist was kind of a joke, his attitude throughout was so fake. The twist was just crazy and I couldn't have ever seen that coming and I don't think anyone would've unless you've seen the original already. So honestly if I had to commend anything it would be Josh Brolin and his performance because he played it off so well. In conclusion I liked this film, it was a good hour and 45 minutes of entertainment and I didn't based everything off the fact that its a remake and its directed by Spike Lee. I mean the point of seeing a movie is to be entertained by it because it is a form of entertainment, I understand if you just thought it was just boring, but giving it a poor review because it can't match the standards of the original is just silly, be honest and stop comparing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better Hollywood remakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of controversial discussions about this movie and I would simply like to add my own opinion. First, let me tell you that I am a big fan of Asian and especially South Korean cinema. The original Oldboy movie was one of the first movies introducing me to South Korean cinema many years ago. I have watched this movie over and over again and it never stopped fascinating me. I am a big fan of original director Park Chan Wook who also made other amazing movies such as the drama "Joint Security Area", the diversified "Sympathy for Mister Vengeance" and the emotional comedy "I'm a Cyborg, but That's OK". The original main actor Choi Min Sik is one of my favourite actors ever who performed in classics like the action blockbuster movie "Shiri", the grizzly masterpiece "I Saw the Devil" or recently in the strong gangster epic "New World". Most Hollywood remakes of Asian movies are quite poor because they can't transfer the magic and uniqueness of the originals and don't add any essential own elements or new plot ideas. When I heard that there would be a Hollywood remake for Oldboy I was frustrated and expected they would dishonour another unique masterpiece.To my own big surprise, this remake is very decent. If you haven't seen the original, you might like it anyway but even if you're a fan of it, this remake is worth your attention and respect.There were some elements I liked better and some parts I didn't like as much as in the original. Let's start with the negative.First of all, I think that the villains portrayed by Sharlto Copley and Samuel L. Jackson are shown a little bit too quickly in this movie. The remake should have kept a few surprises for the middle part of the movie. The original also revealed the villain's identity too quickly in my opinion but the remake made these mistakes even faster.Even though the actors are doing a great job, the relationship between Joe Ducett and Marie Sebastian isn't as appealing, mysterious and later on darkly passionate as in the original film. The story behind it isn't explained in a very credible way in the end.While the remake feels like the predictable love story of two suffering people who need to support each other, the original had a more mature, philosophical and subtle touch.The famous stabbing scene from the original is unbeatable. While the original was quite graphic, the remake starts the same way but turns out to feel like a slapstick moment. This kind of humour doesn't really fit into the movie at that point. This is something I would have expected from a Tarantino movie but not from this kind of movie with a calmer, darker and more menacing tone.While the final scenes of the remake are fine and even add some new elements to the original plot as the film and music studios, I still prefer the ending of the original including the photo book, the hypnotizing scene and the closing moments in the nature. This kind of ending was courageous and made people adore or hate this movie. The makers westernized the original film and gave it an own identity with a less controversial ending here. Concerning the positive aspects, I like the fact that the introduction took more time to show us the backstabbing, greedy and ignorant behaviour of the main character. When we see this character changing over the next twenty years, these elements add some depth to the character development. The first fifteen minutes or so also introduce the viewers to several potential foes who could have imprisoned the main character. As in a classic crime movie, it makes you guess who might have done it. Let's also add that this additional development made me appreciate the main character a lot more than the original one that was perfectly portrayed but a completely different character. This is where Hollywood is trying to do something different. Instead of creating a monster that has lost its mind and acts in a very odd way, it portrays us an arrogant, disrespectful and superficial human being that actually becomes a caring father who knows how to deal with convictions, perseverance and responsibilities. Josh Brolin is doing an excellent job. I must admit that I prefer the new villain. The way he acts, looks and talks has a very unique style. I had never heard of Sharlto Copley before but I have him on my list now.I don't want to give away too many details but I liked two more elements in this remake. First of all, the events that happened to the villain's family were effective, intriguing and gave me goosebumps.Last but not least, I liked the way how the excited villain shows his guest his secret rooms and everything he did over the past twenty years. In the end, I was positively surprised by the high amount of positive aspects in this remake. The movie kept the most important elements from the original and added some own ideas to the formula. The acting was flawless with the character development being the strongest point. The movie was entertaining from the beginning to the end and had no boring moments. The original had a few lengths and less character development but on the other side, it first came around with this amazing plot and included a couple of legendary scenes that can't be found in the remake: the squid eating scene, the brutal stabbing scene, the main character's desperate self-mutilation and the hypnotizing scene in the cold nature. The original is still better and worth nine if not ten points while the remake only gets a generous eight points from me. This movie really is one of the better remakes I have seen and not as bad as people say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary remake yet Brolin makes the best of a terrible situation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OLDBOY (2013) **1/2 Josh Brolin, Elizabeth Olsen, Sharlto Copley, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Imperioli, Pom Kelmentieff, James Ransone, Max Casella, Linda Emond, Lance Reddick, Hannah Ware, Richard Portnow, Hannah Simone. Spike Lee's unnecessary but not-as-bad-as-anticipated remake of Chan-wook Park's 2003 Korean neo noir cult hit with Brolin as an unrepentant advertising rep who finds himself imprisoned by an unknown enemy for twenty years and then suddenly and just as inexplicably released to resolve who his tormentor is and why he has suffered for his captivity ?.and to plan his vengeance. The fight sequences are on track and just as bloody as the original film's while Brolin embodies a man who is attempting to come to terms of his own ugliness within while seeking balance with something to better it including Olsen as a newfound friend who helps him put the pieces of the puzzle together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a nice Hitchcockian quality to the new "Oldboy," Spike Lee's remake of Korean director Park Chan-wook's cult film of revenge and regret. Which is kind of weird, considering that the source material is not Hitchcockian in the least.It's a strange, yet not entirely unsatisfying, fit. In trying to adapt the source material ? not just the 2003 film, but the late 1990s Japanese manga series on which it was based ? Lee and writer Mark Protosevich ("The Cell") have jettisoned some details while significantly reshaping others, all the while keeping the essential outlines of the baroque and quite frankly bizarre tale of punishment and redemption intact. "Oldboy" is grand opera shoved into the shoebox of a murder mystery. As in the original, Lee's "Oldboy" revolves around a man (Josh Brolin, here given the Everyman moniker of Joe) who wakes up after a bender to find that he's been imprisoned in what seems to be a seedy, windowless hotel room where he's fed, through a hole in the locked door, the same carryout Chinese dumplings every day for the next 20 years. (In the manga, it was 10 years; in the first film, 15. I guess that's inflation for you.)Finally, after marinating in enough resentment to pickle his heart, Joe is released, with one thing on his mind: vengeance against whoever imprisoned him. First, Joe must find that person.This isn't actually that hard. For one thing, Joe remembers the taste of the dumplings so vividly that he is able to identify the restaurant, following a delivery man back to the site of his incarceration, where he tortures a henchman (the great Samuel L. Jackson) until he gets some answers. For another thing, the guy who locked Joe up actually wants to be found, despite surrounding himself with layers of ruthless bodyguards, a couple dozen of whom Joe plows through, armed only with a claw hammer.Fans of the 2003 film will be glad to see that Lee has kept this famous scene from the original. Park's amazingly choreographed fight ? an extended set piece in the original ? was shot like moving frames of a comic book, by a camera that tracked back and forth along a static hallway. Here, Lee's style is less formal, and characterized by more fluid, naturalistic camera movement. It's an impressive battle nonetheless.For Joe, the real trick isn't hunting down his adversary, however, but figuring out why he was imprisoned. Accomplished with the assistance of a young woman (Elizabeth Olsen) he meets on the street, this quest is the meat of both movies. The back story that eventually reveals itself in the new film is considerably changed from the original, which may upset some purists.I'd argue that the alterations are an improvement. There was a psychologically false tone to Park's film that never really made sense to me, and which Lee and Protosevich seem to have tried to fix. The ugly secrets that eventually come out ? and that implicate both Joe and his tormentor ? are still crazy, almost preposterous, in their extremity. But there's a sharpness and a clarity to the characters' motivations that help to ground the ridiculous proceedings in a kind of heightened reality.In general, Lee directs with less visual verve than Park. Anchored by Brolin, who brings an almost simian physicality to his portrayal, this "Oldboy" feels simultaneously less showy, less nightmarish and less epic than the original. Nevertheless, with its moral about the ubiquity of man's corruption ? where those who hand out punishment are as guilty as those who receive it ? "Oldboy" redux is just as depraved and depressing as the original.Is it better, worse or just different? Lee's "Oldboy" feels a little less like a tale that's been torn out of a comic book and more like one that's been ripped from the pages of a newspaper.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "Old Boy", starring Josh Brolin-Jonah Hex, Hollow Man; Elizabeth Olsen-Liberal Arts, Silent House, she is the little sister of Mary-Kate &amp; Ashley and she is playing the Scarlet Witch in the next Avengers movie; Sharlto Copley-Elysium, District 9 and Samuel L. Jackson-Django Unchained, Kill Bill:Vol.2.This is based on a South Korean comic book, which was then made into a movie in 2003. Josh plays an advertising executive in 1993 that is not a very nice person. He is a heavy drinker, he is divorced and has a 3 year old daughter that he hardly ever sees. He even hits on the wife of a prospective client, during a meeting where he is trying to get his business. One night, after some heavy drinking, he passes out and then wakes up in what looks like an ordinary motel room. It is far from ordinary; there are no door knobs, Chinese food is slid under the door- it's always Chinese food, and there is no phone. There is a television. On the t.v., he sees the news reporting the murder of his ex-wife and guess who is the prime suspect? His 3 year old daughter is adopted by a nice couple and James spends the next 20 years in the room, with only the t.v. for companionship-he does start working out with all the exercise shows and martial arts movies that he watches and he sobers up. There is also a reality t.v. show that keeps him up-dated on his daughter. 20 years later, James wakes up in a wide open pasture, a free man. He spends the rest of the film trying to find out who put him in the room, and why. Elizabeth plays a volunteer at a clinic that tries to help James in his search for answers. Sharlto and Samuel are two men that just might have some of the answers James is looking for. I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Believe it or not, there are some really good martial arts fight scenes-remember, he watched a lot of t.v.-and there is a shock ending. It's rated "R" for violence, language, and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 44 minutes. I really liked it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Oscar worthy remake of a truly original Korean film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spike Lee has come back into full form with his remake of the top notch film by cinema master Chan Park-Wook "Oldboy". This is the perfect vehicle for Spike because it allows him to introduce the masses in this country, who may not have ever heard of the Korean master of one of the greatest revenge trilogies in the history of cinema (or were too mentally lazy to read the subtitles), to a story made for modern times.If you are looking for a picture that will have you guessing from the opening, this is the picture for you. If you like your movies to have twists and turns,this is for you. If you want a thinking piece of cinema instead of a mindless motion picture this is for you.Spike has applied his wares and (his scriptwriters) put an extra twist on the original making it even better. I hate what it is, but damn it is a revelation. Deftness in action and drama it leaves you breathless from start to finish. You will think about it long after you leave the theater. This is why I think it will be nominated if the academy is looking for original (American) cinema that doesn't fit into the cookie cutter molds and shapes. Josh should be nominated, Spike should be nominated, the screenplay should be nominated, the picture should be nominated.Chan Park-Wook created this perfection, Spike made it palatable for American audiences. A thrill ride if you like your ride white knuckle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't expect it to be as good as the original but it was as good as I expected. I like how Lee payed homage to the original with the girl in wings. However, what makes the original great is the ending and of course, the ending is changed. I though the end was rushed as well and finished way to quickly. SPOILER: What happens at the private school was changed a little bit still similar. (glad they still left that part in) For me the best part of the original was the hypnotist at the end. The very last seen in this version sucked. I don't know why they didn't raise the questions with the hypnotist.When you compare it to the original, there is no comparison. One it's own though, it isn't bad. Most people will see this version for the first time and probably like it (not love it) and that is a shame since most people who saw the original love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is clearly a remake of the 2003 Korean film Oldboy, for those of you who don't know. For those who do and are still complaining, "why ruin and remake a great movie", well, its Hollywood get over it, it's gonna happen. I just couldn't sit and read as all these terrible reviews about this movie were being put on here. I enjoyed the original, and I have no problem with subtitles. I just feel more handicapped to the viewing of the film when I'm constantly reading subtitles, and cant really focus on all aspects of the movie. (However,with that being said, still not saying the 2003 film was a bad one)For those who haven't seen the original, this movie could still be a surprisingly entertaining one with the same story as the original with a good twist just added in differently, &amp; just with a more American feel (which may not work so well due to the difference in cultures between Koreans and Americans &amp; that's why the original worked).I liked Josh Brolin's performance, he really carried the entire movie on his back. I feel like he put a lot of effort into this role, I just think it could have been so much more without Spike at the helm. It followed the original to an extent with some add ins (ex. Adrian's father murdering his whole family) and take outs (ex. no one loses their teeth, Josh Brolin doesn't like octopus)Saddens me that Sharlto Copley's performance was one of his worst so far.(whether its him or Spike Lee's fault, I'm not quite sure.) I really liked him in District 9 and as the villain in Elysium so I thought he would carry well as the antagonist against Brolin. I really think he brought the film down with the whole "bad guy" look, long nasty fingernails, he is supposed to be a billionaire but cant get those nails fixed??? I mean common. Same goes with Samuel's character with the blonde ponytail, I cant help but to think that it is Spikes doing.Elizabeth Olsen was....Elizabeth.....not expecting much from the Olsen sisters in the first place except a nice rack. I suppose you could say this is one of her better performances.Spike Lee really turned this into more Hollywoodish then I like. I would've liked the whole mystery behind who did it to Joe rather than telling us in the first 45 minutes.So with all that being said I still give this an 8/10 for the story itself thanks to the original. Yes we all know the original is better, but this is still a movie you can sit through and watch &amp; be entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Execution honoring the integrity of the original, while Americanizing it appropriately.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a lot to say about Spike Lee's interpretation of the story originally handled by Chan Wook-Park, and this title stands respectably on its own. To start, if you've not seen the original movie, don't worry, this version has you covered (if you have seen the original, I'll address that later). The art, feel, and intensity of the film carry well with the overall tone of the movie. The story itself is incredibly compelling-and if you're any fan of mystery or revenge films, don't let anyone tell you the plot--it's worth riding it out. The music never seems out of place, and I was unusually impressed with Samuel L Jackson's role in the movie as restrained thug cum businessman. For Josh Brolin's part, he carried his desperate role well--desperation followed by rage, repeat, rinse. Ashley Olson was impeccable. The villain...well, he did OK, but his part seemed a bit forced. Now for those who have seen the original Oldboy. (Some spoilers!). This movie could NOT have possibly worked in its original format, especially the ending. Cross-cultural differences make far too great a difference. There's no way an American audience would buy Josh Brolin cutting off his own tongue and barking like a dog. The ending had to change, even in the slightest sense. Many are up upset that this is a remake no one asked for--you're right, nobody asked for it...but there is importance in retelling a great story to an audience in a more approchable way. Stigma has attached itself to foreign movies because of the dreaded subtitle-reading and often bad dubbing (and the original has noticeably poor voice acting in the English dub). I wouldn't have ever called myself a fan of Spike Lee-I harbor no resentment toward him, and I don't know his body of work as well as most do. Lee handled this piece with respect and, more importantly, gave another life to a story that could never have been told in the U.S. due to its extremely taboo nature. The movie has legs. The product placement sucked though, and rarely, the cinematography seemed off--Brolin's pillow companion is an example, with it facing the camera while Brolin faced the wall. Watch it. Have an open mind. Experience it. Even for the second time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low scores from Park fans skew ratings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Twice I tried to watch the original Oldboy and neither time did I ever make it to the end. I'm not queasy about violence or detached, normally, from the world of the bizarre, but when you combine both elements with Korean, it all becomes a bit much. The Chan-wook Park Oldboy a level of bravery to watch much like that required to volunteer for surgery without anesthetic or painkillers. But I was curious about Spike Lee's version and following him on Twitter, I told him (or whoever tweets for him) that I hoped it would be a bit less "hardcore." And it is. (A funny anecdote. I entered the theater early and discovered 3 older, grandmotherly white women--probably in their 60s--all sitting together in the row in front of me. Amused, I walked over to them &amp; said "excuse me, but you all don't look like the typical Oldboy fans to me." They all looked up at me with one face, "what are typical Oldboy fans?" One woman on the end was kinda smirking. I replied, "the original is somewhat brutal and bizarre--I tried to watch it twice and failed in both attempts." Then they started looking at each other and two pointed to the smirking woman. "She suggested it! We don't know anything about it!" Those women sat fully absorbed throughout the film.)Which leads me to my next point. The Korean Oldboy was very much a spectacle that in many places was just really painful to sit through (if you're not the type to play gory video games on a regular basis). Lee's Oldboy does serve up some of that brutality, but there is a story attached to it that helps override the few (and less) gory parts. Is it better. On its own merits, it's okay. In fact, I probably will watch it again when it's released on DVD. It's not as spectacular and imaginative as Park's but it is engaging. In some ways, it reminds me of the Pedro Almodavar film "The Skin I Live In," an equally bizarre story with an unexpected twist at the end and a film I truly admired. Don't let the low scores keep you away. It really is more worth your money than nearly all the other junk at the movies today.</fullReview>

The violence might've been so prolonged that it was boring at times...yes.But I liked this film very much. If you've seen the original, then you know the power of truly good character development and you know how difficult it was to see the ending of this film play out the way it does.Spike Lee takes his version to a bit of a different level, while keeping very many of the same scenes and subject matter as the old one. One thing I do like to commend is the character developments. I really felt into the film, and the over-the-top violence didn't draw me out of the film as usual. In all, the story is one that obviously has been done before, ergo the definition of a remake. But, I do think the way this one was done was a pleasant surprise. Many people who are huge fans of the original film will be divided by this remake, but I know I was very pleased with the end result.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly Entertaining Revenge Thriller/Mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen the original so my opinion here is completely unbiased.While at times it did feel a bit rushed and I was never as emotionally involved in the story as I wished I was, I still found Spike Lee's remake to be a highly entertaining film. It plays out like a really straight forward (perhaps a little too straight) revenge thriller/mystery with that benefits from a strong performance from Josh Brolin and plenty of brutal over-the-top violence. The greatest thing about it though has to be the twist which is one of the most disturbing, twisted, and sickening things I've ever seen in a film. This isn't a great film and I have no doubt that the original is superior (I wouldn't be surprised if I would be more critical of the film If I had seen the original), but this is still a solid remake that's highly entertaining and worth checking out. It isn't anywhere as bad as many of the reviews on here suggest it is.If you have seen the original, I would say you don't necessarily need to see this version. If you haven't though, give it a shot!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie, A definitely MUST SEE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I have to say I have not seen the original movie and i was not that familiar with the plot itself.The movie was excellent not to say superb, i think the story itself is one of the most original ones. A man is imprisoned by "someone" for 20 years and then let go for reasons unknown. The imprisoned now will want revenge and wants to find out who and why did this.The plot itself 10/10. Acting is good, but I would have wanted to see more of the charecteristics and motives explained.This is definitely a MUST WATCH movie for everybody who has not seen the original. I can not understand how is the rating so low at the moment. Should be 8/10 definitely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love it or Hate it, It's a surprisingly good remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After I saw the movie "I Saw The Devil", I checked out right away who directed it at IMDb. I saw it's Park Chan Wook and while I scroll down to his filmography I came across the movie "Oldboy" and heard that it's one of the best twist ending of all time. I'm a fan of twist endings and check out the movie. I thought it was a good movie. Not great but good. Now 13 years after the original, Spike Lee Directed the remake of this movie. Lot's of people who love the Original started to bash it and said why remake? Well, as a movie buff, I actually find it annoying to keep reading subtitles while watching a foreign movie. It's hard to focus on the movie itself if I keep looking at the subtitles. So I actually thought remaking this movie make sense especially for English viewers who haven't seen the original. Anyway back to the remake movie itself. While I was in the theater, I kept comparing the differences between this and the original and honestly, it's almost identical except the beginning and the last few minutes that leads to a jaw dropping ending. Also because I already saw the original, the ending is not as shocking as before so I watched this movie with a different mindset and low expectations. In the end, I prefer the Remake, I wish I haven't seen the Original. Why? I felt like the remake's story is more detailed and clear than the original. Josh Brolin's performance is excellent. The whole movie itself is just as entertaining as the original or better. So if you haven't seen the Original, I say go watch this Remake now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall better than the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am probably in the minority when it comes to thinking the original Oldboy wasn't that good. It had a crazy plot twist and a lasting shock effect but it wasn't that special. After seeing the spike lee version I actually wished I never saw the original because this version does A lot of things so much better. Even though I preferred the originals voice-overs, the updated version had a much more thought out reason for the imprisonment and revenge. It made much more sense for the plot twist as well. It even had some clever nods to the original. (Tongue?) My biggest gripes of the movie would be the expansion of the role played by Samuel L Jackson. It played a slight bonding role but it just really irked me. Also the slight showing of Doucett's "learned" fighting ability. The ending doesn't have the same level of sadness the original had but it was still hollowing.With the better acting(Sharlto Copley is freaky good)and more cohesive script/plot, I definitely say this is better than original.</fullReview>
