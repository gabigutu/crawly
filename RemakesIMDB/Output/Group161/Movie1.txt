		<shortDescription>Masterpiece of intense drama, with hidden depths</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Get Carter" is often said to have inspired the current crop of British gangster films. If this is the case, Guy Ritchie et al must have well and truly got the wrong end of the stick. I haven't actually seen "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" or any of the "Right Royal Cockney Barrel O'Monkeys" type films which followed it, but I get the impression that these are merely dumb entertainment for "new" lads. In contrast, "Get Carter" is unremittingly bleak. If Samuel Beckett wrote a gangster film, it might come out something like this. The grim Newcastle locations add to an atmosphere of decay and despair. The naturalistic camera work avoids cliches and adds effectively to the atmosphere. Long, static shots give the impression of actually being present as a bewildered bystander as the gangsters go about their "business". Although the long tracking shots of people walking/running are almost pythonesque at times, this only serves to emphasise the down to earth realism of the film. After all, even violent gangsters have to go through banal routines such as walking down the street. The score is minimalist but very effective, in contrast to the modern British films which seem to be conceived as a gravy train for music publishers and second rate "indie" bands.There are few, if any, sympathetic characters. Jack Carter, the central character, is not at all pleasant or heroic. The only people for whom he shows any affection are Frank and Doreen, and he is unable to express this affection except through money and violence. Keith thinks he is Carter's friend, but when he is let down and beaten up he realises that he is being used. Carter does not appear to love Anna, and it is not certain whether she really loves him, although there is a genuine sexual attraction between them. Carter belongs to a misogynistic and hypocritical culture which the film scathingly exposes. The only scene in which he shows any genuine emotion is when he discovers a porn film featuring his niece, Doreen. The cruel irony is that in the opening scene, he was seen looking at dirty pictures with his cronies, and his disgust must be partly directed at himself even though he refuses to acknowledge it. He then expresses his shock and outrage by going straight upstairs to assault and humiliate the nearest woman! And she just happens to have appeared in the very same film as Doreen: a clear case of men projecting their own sexual guilt onto women. The makers of the film cannot have been unaware of the implications of this sexual hypocrisy. The scenes are deliberately juxtaposed to emphasise Carter's ambivalence and double standards.The certainties of a linear narrative have been bravely eschewed. Carter is only able to react to events which are beyond his control and is sometimes led up blind alleys, taking a long time to realise what is really going on. This, again, is realism at its best. Real life does not have a coherent plot and nobody has complete control over their own life. Carter's lack of control is a central theme of the film. He likes to think that he is big, hard and clever, but his acts of revenge are ultimately pointless. Like Frank Machin in "This Sporting Life", he is emotionally shallow and able to express himself only through futile acts of aggression. He is cruelly exposed in the final scene as the smile is wiped off his face, the closing shot of the sea emphasising man's powerlessness.The film also contains elements of social comment and class politics. Frank is portrayed as a decent, honest, "salt of the earth" working class type, while the slimy and sinister Kinnear has a chauffeur and lives in a big house in the country where he hosts decadent orgies. These themes come to the fore in the (often overlooked) funeral scene. As Frank's small cortege pulls through the gates of the crematorium, we see an endless stream of cars leaving from the previous funeral. The message is that the "liberation" of the 60s brought few practical benefits for working class people in the north of England. Again, this relates to the dominant theme of control, or lack of it. The "swinging 60s" are exposed as a dead end of pointless hedonism. The extent of women's liberation is also questioned. "Get Carter" portrays a society in which women are not at all liberated except in a few superficial ways. The female characters in the film are all victims, owned and used by men who see them as sex objects and little more. It is implied that the sexual freedom brought by the contraceptive pill has benefited men more than women.It's not all angst and depression though. There is some good fighting, swearing, shooting and dangerous driving. There are also many subtle touches of black humour. Nevertheless, this is not a mindless action film. The consequences of violence are never ignored or glossed over. We are shown Keith lying on his bed in agony after getting a severe beating, leaving us in no doubt that his brief flirtation with gangsters has ruined his life."Get Carter" is a masterpiece, although it will not be to everyone's taste. If you want non-stop action, try a mindless Arnold Schwarzeneger film. There is nothing for you here. However, if you are prepared to approach "Get Carter" with an open mind and think about it rather than be a passive observer demanding to be entertained, you will find a rewarding work of art with hidden depths. Forget Guy Ritchie. The only worthy successor of "Get Carter" is Neil Jordan's "Mona Lisa", which addresses similar themes and is equally bleak and disturbing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece of Grittiness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of Caine's best roles and undoubtedly one of the greatest gangster/crime films ever made. It is unrelentingly harsh, gritty, and bleak in showing the nasty world of Carter. Few characters are truly likable or admirable and most have a mix of good and bad. This applies to Carter himself and even the bystanders or victims. Everyone is portrayed as flawed somehow, even those who are tragic. This is one of many aspects that adds to the realism of this film.This grittiness is true not only of the world of crime, but the entire world of the early post-industrial Northern England, once at the forefront of the industrial revolution but by then a depressed backwater that had yet to feel the true benefits of recent social and economic changes. It thus provides some subtle social commentary as well, although one may easily miss it. In addition to its raw grittiness, the film is also very intense. There is a building tension throughout, and a palpable that things are not right. At the same time, the events, in particular the action and violence are rather slow but relentless.In fact, the way the film presents the violence and action is one of the keys to its greatness. It is an unusual, fascinating, and very powerful depiction. There isn't gore or even lots of blood or the like and, like the rest of the film, it generally progresses slowly and calmly. It's not exhilarating or glamorous, but instead deliberate, relentless, and, above all, cold. The coldness of the violence and how Carter in particular, but others as well, kill and hurt in an unfeeling, perfunctory manner makes it seem all the more harsh.Another interesting aspect of the film is the juxtaposition of the idea that someone can force or change events around him against the feeling that one can merely react to events beyond his control. Both of these themes seem to clash in Carter and his actions, for one of these themes may at times appear to be what's happening, yet in the end it seems that the other exerts its dominance. Ultimately, this is superb, extremely gritty, and powerful drama. It contains action and violence, but it is not an action film and most expecting a non-stop action film, with flashy fighting, "getting the bad guys," etc. may well be bored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate in British gangster chic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Shakespeare could have written a gangster movie, "Get Carter" would surely be the one. Jack Carter is the 1970s embodiment of classical tragic heroes like Hamlet or Macbeth. Also, in the finest Shakespearian tradition, as the film reaches its climax, the bodies begin to mount with alarming rapidity.The film is initially a slow-burner, but what is arguably a career-best performance from Michael Caine sustains interest until the plot begins, in every sense, to kick in. And when it does, there's no stopping it, as Carter ruthlessly, and recklessly, sets about dealing with his enemies.The industrial city of Newcastle is depicted as gritty, seedy and unapologetically working class. The grainy camerawork gives the impression that this is a real-life documentary rather than a gangster flick.Probably every British gangster movie since has used "Get Carter" as a benchmark, particularly "The Long Good Friday", or even the revoltingly trendy "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels". Any why shouldn't they? For the ultimate British gangster icon, you need look no further than Jack Carter and his silver Ford Cortina.A genuine classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>70's period piece that still cuts the mustard...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Strongman and enforcer Jack Carter (Michael Caine) returns to his native North East (of England) to investigate the suspicious death of his brother. Here he encounter a world of sleaze, booze, violence, casual sex and people in search of easy money.Hard to call it a classic early British gangster film given that they were so few around, but more a cracking thriller that makes full use of its cast, plot and (unusual) Newcastle Upon Tyne location.Writer-Director Mike Hodges wanted violence with reality and he delivers it with real punch. Unlike most thrillers bystanders are not immune from the action and at various stages harsh punishment is handed out for minor crimes by anti-hero Caine.Caine underplays his hardman role nicely - letting the action, rather than his emotions, tell the story.Several people claim real-life events "inspired" this story, but as far as I can tell the only direct reference to real events is that the one-arm bandit business started to earn big money (in the North East) and London gangsters "wanted in." That lead to bloodshed, but that is not the thrust of this film - although one of the main characters is, indeed, in that business.Having gone to the trouble of reading the screenplay, I was surprised how thin the dialogue was. This is a good example of how it is better to "show" things rather than "tell." I did learn, however, that the thugs that come to beat Caine up are supposed to be gay - one may wear a pink neckerchief but I thought that was just the dandy fashions of the day!Those that are not familiar with Newcastle may also like to note that the place is nowhere near the sea, in case you decide to take a holiday up there and are thinking of packing your trunks!On release the film did well enough in the UK, but died a death in the USA due to being released as a double bill with Dirty Dingus Magee: A terrible Frank Sinatra movie.If you like hard-edged thrillers that don't play nice then Get Carter may well be worth your time and effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget Lock Stock and 2 smoking......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget Lock stock...this is how a British gangster film should be made. Michael Caine is excellent as the London based hardman going back to Newcastle to avenge the death of his brother. The use of provincial locations in the early 1970s is almost unique in british cinema. Newcastle itself, it has to be said,looks as cold and ruthless as Jack Carter himself and wouldnt be used by the North of England tourist board.Look out for some first rate performances especially Ian Hendry and the playwrite John Osbourne as a sinister Mr Big.The film is violent and uncompromising but also very entertaining with a neat line in black humour. Dont miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Godfather</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there can be anything such as a 'generic genre', then the great British gangster film must be it. But don't blame Get Carter for this, blame Madge's husband, Guy Ritchie. I saw Get Carter again recently and it must be the least dated film from the seventies ever made. This is largely because the situations, characters, settings and even fashions are so slice of life. It's a lot more convincing than a lot of the Sean Penn stuff at the moment, and even hyper-real stuff like Gummo or Julian Donkey Boy. I think this is because there's no exaggeration in Get Carter. It's not shot in some weird hicky town in the middle of nowhere, it's shot in Newcastle, one of the UK's major cities. And Get Carter tells it like it is. It is this no-nonsense style that still makes it look one of the coolest films around. Also, there aren't any heroes, which is a good thing. Well, how many 'heroes' have you met? Carter, though no hero, is a great character, make no mistake about that, and he shows just enough emotion for the audience to identify with him: like when he stumbles across his dead brother's daughter in some seedy porn film, and the whole motivation for his revenge mission in the first place. But he is a cold blooded killer too, hardened by London's gangland, and violence is his main emotional outlet in everything else - sex etc - he's pretty cool. It's not just the killers he's after, it's anyone even associated with it. And he dispatches them with a passion. "I know you didn't kill him!! I know!!" and "Goodbye ----!!" being two memorable sign offs. I really do believe this is a better film than Godfather. Godfather exists in a world most of us will never experience and is one of the best Hollywood films. Get Carter though, exists in our world, and the superb characters, acting and writing make it totally believable - even when Michael Caine walks naked out of the door of his seedy B &amp; B with his shotgun to escort out some local hoods, the most memorable thing you remember about the scene is the previously belligerent moaning old lady neighbour scurrying into her house, terrified. Oh, and Budd's soundtrack is pure sleazy brilliance, well up to the standard of virtually everything else about the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Jack went home!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Get Carter, not just one of the finest exponents of British neo - noir, but one of the greatest British films ever, period. Michael Caine stars as Jack Carter, a tough no nonsense operator in the London underworld who returns to his home town of Newcastle Upon Tyne when his brother turns up dead. Directed and adapted to screenplay by Mike Hodges from Ted Lewis' novel Jack's Return Home, Get Carter is a bleakly atmospheric masterwork that takes the period setting of the time and blends harsh realism with film noir sensibilities and filters it through an uncut prism of doom.Jack Carter as created by Caine and Hodges is the quintessential film noir anti-hero. He smokes French cigarettes and reads Raymond Chandler, there is no hiding the respect and homages to classical noir pulsing away as Jack goes on his not so merry way. He's a vengeful angel of death, but sexy as hell with it, he even has humorous pearls of wisdom to spout, delivered with relish by Caine who is at his snake eyed best.In a strange quirk of the narrative, Jack is home but he's a fish out of water, he's a suited and booted Cockney lad moving amongst the flotsam and jetsam of North Eastern society. It's a crumbling landscape of terraced houses and coal yards, of seedy clubs and bed and breakfast establishments where, as Jack wryly observes, the beds have seen untold action.Jack Carter is a hard bastard, borderline psychotic once his mind has tuned into the frequency that plays to him the tunes of mistrust, of double-dealings, liars and thieves, of pornographers and gangsters who thrive on gaining wealth while the society around them falls into a depression. It's Fog on the Tyne for sure here. Yet Jack is not devoid of heartfelt emotion, his family ties are strong, and there is a point in the film when Jack sheds a tear, it is then when we all know that all bets are off and there will be no coming back from this particular abyss.Hodges and cinematographer Wolfgang Suschitzky strip it all back for maximum impact, so much so you can smell the salt of the murky sea, feel your lungs filling up with chimney smoke, the whiff of working class sweat is all around, and all the time Roy Budd's contemporary musical score jingles and jangles over proceedings like a dance of death waiting to reach its operatic conclusion. And with Caine backed up by a roll call of super working class character actors, Get Carter just gets better as each decade of film making passes.Like its antagonist/protagonist (yes, Jack is both, a deliberate contradiction) it's a film as hard as nails, where home format releases should be delivered through your letterboxes in a metal case. No lover of film noir can have an excuse to have not seen it yet. Funny, sexy, brutal and not without a ticking time bomb of emotional fortitude as well, Get Carter is the "A" Bomb in Grey Street. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After finally getting to see the 1971 version I think two things I know why people hated on the remake with Stallone &amp; dang for this time period I bet this movie was flagged for some of the content. This movie is plain and simple just perfect in the revenge noir. It starts a tad slow but it is building up character backgrounds a little but is well worth it. This flick has fooled from start to finish even though you think your on track. Caine is great as a gangster with no regrets for what he is or what he's done ever.There's just one rule don't mess with a man's family especially a bad man. He doesn't take kindly to the misfortunes of his brother who has lived a good &amp; truthfull life,or you will have to pay the price.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>British gangster classic starring Michael Caine as the eminently quotable, ultimately tough Jack Carter Hard to believe that a major studio felt the need to remake this British gangster classic, which ranks up there with the likes of The Long Good Friday as one of the finest home grown films of the past 30 years.Caine is the gangster who goes to Newcastle for his brother's funeral and begins to suspect his death was no accident; cue edgy thrills and violence as he exacts revenge on the folks he believes responsible.Caine, as in the majority of his signature roles, is superbly armed with a set of eminently quotable one-liners ("You're a big man, but you're out of shape" tops the bill this time), and as emotionally detached and violently ruthless as Point Blank's similarly vengeful Lee Marvin, while director Hodges paints a gritty, bleak picture of the gangster underworld.Soap fans will be equally intrigued to see Coronation Street's Alf Roberts (aka Bryan Moseley) being tossed off a roof.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best British Films Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Caine has often said that GET CARTER was the first gangster movie not to portray gangsters as either being stupid or funny . He`s right , but he could also have added that this was probably the first film not to show gangsters as being sexy in anyway . Sure Glenda , Magaret etc might be physically attractive but sexy ? I don`t think so . And the men aren`t any less unattractive , almost all of them are cowardly two faced weasels or violent thugs and often these character traits overlap.Director Mike Hodges has made a bleak , nihilistic classic film . He isn`t flashy unlike present day film makers associated with gangster flicks but that`s not a criticism . I love the way Hodges makes use of the locations in showing the North East of England as a cold , austere windswept urban area of high rise council estates and red brick terraced houses with outside toilets . There is a train of thought that by showing the audience all this it dates the film but it`s also true that it reminds us that living standards are also different today . No one takes a phone call in the pub because everyone has a mobile phone nowadays , the internet and videos have replaced slide shows and silent 8mm as the medium for porn , and it`s now illegal to dump the slag from coal mining into the sea because of EU regulations GET CARTER also has some really great dialogue which I could sit here all day quoting . But I won`t bother except to say my favourite line is when Carter jumps out of bed naked and holds a gun on Con and PeterCon : Put it away jack you know you won`t use it Peter : The gun he`s talking about classic dialogue from a classic film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a gangster movie which takes the central figure-hardly the hero, because Carter (Michael Cane) is a brutal racketeer-out of the confines of Soho and away up north to the gangland of Newcastle-upon-Tyne...The plot concerns Carter's efforts to discover who was responsible for the death of his brother... Against the wished of his London gang-boss he takes the train to Newcastle, and embarks upon a single-handed crusade of violence against the north-country gangsters..."Get Carter" is a film which, in its way, is as ruthless as Don Siegel's 'Dirty Harry.' Carter is not a likable character... He is a perplexing lead character whom we never grow to care about, or even understand... He just happened to be a crook and a murderer pursuing his own private vendetta...Memorable scenes include Caine with a shotgun ejecting a couple of thugs from his bed-and-breakfast; the car going into the docks with an unnoticed passenger in the trunk; and a mob boss taking a dive from a multi-story parking garage...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a nasty bastard of a movie with a steel-eyed, cold but brilliant performance in the lead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Carter is not someone you'd usually want to take home to your mother. He's a career criminal, a gangster in London whose brother was in Newcastle (his hometown) when he found out that he died under mysterious circumstances. Already we're on his side, since it was obviously not a typical drunk-driving accident that caused Frank Carter's death, and we want to see revenge and/or justice. But Jack Carter, that man with a near-permanent dour look on his face and a tendency to get violent, isn't a typical protagonist. He's something of an anti-hero, a nasty one at that, who is a perpetual womanizer (in one oddly hot scene he talks with a direct tone on the phone with a gangster's moll to take off her clothes and masturbate), and will hurt anyone he needs to, sometimes to extreme lengths, to get what he needs to know.Certainly he's surrounded in a murky enough criminal environment. The Newcastle of 'Get Carter' is a place with sleazy gangsters betting big bucks and nightclubs with of-the-period music, and women running hotels with weathered looks on their faces. It's here that Carter goes on his investigation, like a hard-boiled detective without mercy. And as he digs deeper into what is at the heart of the mystery- that Frank Carter wasn't a saint, but got duped by the criminal elements and in a pornographic film that brings Jack to tears of rage- it becomes clear he'll have to knock a few heads, and shoot when he must... which is a lot.Carter might be more unlikable if not for the star in the role. Michael Caine has a look to him in this film that recalls Alain Delon in the Jean-Pierre Melville pictures, specifically Le Samourai. Nothing can really flinch this guy, unless it's something that he actually cares about. But Caine gives humanity to a character that is on the move, almost always, and has to be on his toes when around unsavory characters. I loved seeing how Caine can just be great at looking around a room or a situation or looking over a person, and how when he gets angry, boy you better get out (even if, or sometimes especially because, you're a woman not dishing on what needs to be told). Caine helps a film that needs that star quality- other actors like John Osbourne as the Big Gangster Kinnear and Ian Hendry as Eric do well enough if only good performances- and where the film digs into some subversive, dark terrain, we have to keep watching it to see how Caine can pull it off.Another perk for Hodges is how he deals with the action. Often his film will feel a little slow-going (never too boring, but of a time period, the 70's, when a story could take a little more time in establishing mood), but when action and violence come up it's genuinely shocking and thrilling. We expect to get some satisfaction seeing Carter getting his payback at the criminals, but here there's a dastardly twist as to how just rotten Carter can be with these figures. He goes to their level, and Hodges lets us go along for the wicked neo-noir ride. Some may find it too dark, or just a little too unrelentingly bleak with what Carter finds and how he gets his revenge. But there's the bittersweet part to it as well, especially in the last act, that makes it worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Caine's reputation cemented</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Get Carter - by which I mean the British original starring Michael Caine, not the dodgy US remake with Stallone - achieves something remarkable. It tells a story of unremitting sordidness, populated by deeply unpleasant people, full of base truths and hopelessness, and headed up by a protagonist of monumental brutality, and not only makes it accessible, but we end up enjoying it.We should come away from Get Carter depressed, and dispirited if not actually damaged, but we come away entertained and, in a curious way, almost uplifted. And this isn't because we want to be like Jack Carter, far from it. It may be because there is a kind of catharsis to be gained from the fact that the bad people in this film have made the mistake in choosing the people they have made victims: Jack Carter's brother and niece - assumed to be innocents - have, as an avenger, someone who is worse than the villains who have killed/corrupted them.Every performance here is first rate, but Michael Caine's Jack Carter - deadly cold and malevolent even when he is at his most charming - is a stunning creation. The industrial northern locations are as bleak as the story, and the final sequence, with Jack pursuing Ian Hendry's Eric, is as gripping as anything in cinema right up until its last shocking moment. Roy Budd's spare score is just right, and Mike Hodges' direction is superb.But this is Caine's film and, after Alfie, it is probably the film which did most to confirm his position as a class act.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"...before Carter gets you!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It used to be the case that movies did not play on British television until five years after their original release. 'Get Carter' ( 1971 ) appeared on I.T.V. in 1976. Producer Michael Klinger complained: "Its not right that they should buy a film, and then cut it about.". He had a point. So much of the swearing, nudity and violence had been removed that it looked tamer than 'Dixon Of Dock Green'. Unfortunately, this emasculated version was the one British viewers were stuck with for the next fifteen years, until Alex Cox's 'Moviedrome' series on B.B.C.-2 finally showed an uncut print.Based on the brilliant novel 'Jack's Return Home' by Ted Lewis, the film tells the story of Jack Carter ( Michael Caine ), a hoodlum who returns to his native Newcastle to find out why his brother Frank died. As soon as he steps off the train, he is plunged into a nightmare world of corruption, pornography, and violence. Frank had been working for flesh-peddler Cyril Kinnear ( playwright John Osbourne ). Kinnear has a rival in the shape of Cliff Brumby ( Bryan Mosley ). Surviving numerous attempts to either rough him up or kill him outright, Carter then discovers his niece Doreen ( Petra Markham ) had starred in one of Kinnear's porn flicks. He goes ballistic ( the girl was actually his illegitimate daughter ), and one death follows another, culminating in a tense showdown on a beach with Kinnear's creepy henchman Eric ( Ian Hendry )...'Get Carter' presented criminals as they actually are - low life scum. It feels at times like a revenge Western set in the north of England ( when he goes into a pub, faces turn to look at him ). But Caine's character is no hero, in fact he's every bit as nasty as those he opposes. He verges on the robotic at times, but this works in the film's favour as his explosion of fury near the end is all the more powerful ( I was amazed to see another reviewer lambasting him for being 'unlikeable'! He is meant to be! ). Caine is marvellous, as is the rest of the cast, which includes Bernard Hepton, George Sewell, Tony Beckley, Terence Rigby, Alun Armstrong, Godfrey Quigley, and the sexy Geraldine Moffatt. Britt Ekland has a small but memorable role as 'Anna', the girlfriend of Carter's current employer, with whom he is having an affair, and who masturbates while talking to Carter on the phone ( another scene I.T.V. saw fit to remove ). Ian Hendry did not get on well with the star ( he felt 'Carter' should have been offered to him first ), and the animosity helps the movie. The locations are well used, particularly the multi-storey car park ( which I understand no longer exists ), pubs, racing track, waterfront and so on. At Frank's funeral, there is a wonderful shot of hearses speeding down a hill with factory chimneys belching smoke in the distance.Did I hear someone referring to the film's 'dated feel'? Well, that is time's fault, not the film's. The B.B.C.'s 'Life On Mars' series bent over backwards to try and recapture the same atmosphere.Though a hit in Britain, 'Get Carter' was put on the bottom half of a double bill in America with 'Dirty Dingus Magee', a dreadful 'comedy' Western starring Frank Sinatra. Audiences stayed away in droves. In 2000, however, Sylvester Stallone starred in an American remake, with Caine as 'Brumby'. It tried to make Carter likable, and brought in an unnecessary 'happy ending'. The film flopped.In 2010, the original's reputation is intact. It stands up to repeated viewing incredibly well ( as soon as Carter's train thunders into the tunnel and Roy Budd's marvellous theme tune kicks in, you're well and truly hooked ). Mike Hodges, who wrote and directed, deserves credit for this, the best British movie of the '70's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sheer gangster movie poetry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>British cinema in the early seventies threw up a clutch of gritty urban gangster movies ? including "Villain" with Richard Burton and the crucially underrated "Sitting Target" with Oliver Reed. The definitive example of the genre is clearly Mike Hodges "Get Carter." The plot involves Michael Caine's Jack Carter, a snake-eyed London heavy, travelling back to his industrialised hell-hole of a hometown to investigate the death of his brother who expired in suspicious circumstances.Caine gives his most iconic performance. Forget Alfie, this is the defining moment in his acting career. Jack Carter is a ferocious, violent, amoral hit man, ready to explode at the slightest hint of provocation. He is single-minded, obsessive, and completely devoid of any consideration or compassion regarding his own life or the lives of others. The only emotions he displays are anger and a terrifyingly controlled aggression. The single deviation from his emotional nihilism comes in one key scene, when he realises that his niece (who is probably his daughter) has been brutally exploited and coerced into appearing in a hardcore porn film. There is a brief glimpse of humanity as he weeps silently ? but it doesn't last for long. In seconds he hardens and physically assaults the hooker who co-starred in the film until she gives him information. This leads to him locking her into the trunk of a sports car and later watching dispassionately as it is dumped into a river ? with her still in it.Caine's performance is a revelation ? framed as a sadistic, avenging angel carving a path of death and mayhem in pursuit of justice for a brother he didn't care for and a daughter and family he has hardly ever seen or had any contact with. Motivation for his behaviour can only stem from the pointlessness of his own existence, a cold, hollow life, violent and joyless, devoid of love and comfort. He sets out to do something, and do it he does, whatever the cost, fulfilling his own death wish in the process. Carter is a man who knows where his actions will lead, yet doesn't care. The term "antihero" just cannot come anywhere close to accurately depicting him.Mike Hodges directs with unparallelled flair and skill. The cinematic landscape is one of beautifully realised dirtiness, grime and industrial pollution and decay ? aptly mirroring the moral decay and dissolution of the characters that pass through it. The streets are cramped, dingy terraces and grungy seventies working-class chic is prevalent ? pubs, clubs, ugly ageing cabaret artistes, tobacco smoke and beer fumes. By contrast, the local Mr Big (superbly underplayed by playwright John Osborne) lives in a secluded and ostentatious country mansion populated by dolly-birds and middle-aged poker-playing sleazebags. His competitor, Brumby, resides on a mock-Tudor suburban estate. The class divide is thrown into sharp relief ? crime pays and brings luxury, working for a living obviously doesn't, bringing instead misery and premature death.Carter is the ultimate outsider ? he doesn't fit in anywhere. He collides with both cultures and methodically tears them asunder. This is the best British gangster film ever made. Not one wasted frame, not one superfluous line of dialogue, everything has a meaning and relevance. A master class of neo-realistic cinematic poetry. If you haven't seen it, then do so. If you have, then watch it again. It's worth its weight in gold. Word of warning, though ? do not under any circumstances confuse this with the appalling and insulting Stallone remake. Get the original "Get Carter."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gosh; was it really just 2 years since the 60's stopped swinging?Remember that brightly-coloured, upbeat and totally over-the-top comedy crime caper 'The Italian Job'? It was just 1969. How very different from this. True; most of the former was set in Italy with plenty of Mediterranean sunshine, but even if it was a comedy it accurately reflected the Year of Hope. We'd just landed on the moon for Gawd's sake.In 'Get Carter' we have an equally authentic vehicle to usher-in the 1970's. There's still a very London-centric take on the nation. Despite so much of the last decade's pop-music coming from 'up-north', the view of it as a cultural backwater hasn't changed. By the time Jack arrives, the sun has already set. There's a sense of failure and hopelessness at odds with his evident determination. The client?le of a pub are confused and punished-looking, like the hicks of the movie Deliverance'. There's no romancing this world.Jack is returning home. The opening credits encapsulate and abbreviate his train-ride from London to the Tyneside of his birthplace, with a hollow and achingly minimalist theme music. Just four jarring notes, and you're there. As an intro it stands as a classic to compare with that of 'Walk On The Wild Side', where a strolling cat is slowed to the tempo of a big jazz number.The colours have all washed out. Psychedelia has ended. There's not a hint of Sergeant Pepper. The sky seems perennially grey, even in sunshine. Bleak Landscape is pockmarked by the monolithic vestiges of dying and doomed industry. Civic pride is reduced to a mismatched band of marching children. The season is unclear. It's always cold up-north.There are no decent people. Those who would be are crushed under the burden of daily existence. Others cling to the rag-ends of hope: bingo, betting shops, unfulfilled passion, a job at Woolworths. Jack loves his brother like a brother. He weeps for his passing, but carelessly shaves over his body. And in time he leaves a trail of slaughter in pursuit of fraternal revenge.There is very little humour. It is intentionally trite and shallow, like that of a bad working-mens' club comedian. The final scenes are almost a summation of the movie as a whole. You can see why Jack wanted out, aspired to something better, went south to the bright lights. Waterside structures are wet and slippery with decay. The north sea rolls in, cold and black and poisoned. The beaches are laced with coal and the tailings of indiscriminate neglect. But there's no escaping home; it always draws you back.This movie is in all respects a work of genius. But it leaves a taste like flat beer, a smell of stale urine. 'Get Carter' has a hang-over all its own.Incidentally, as a northerner living in London for the last 20 years, I'm still waiting to acquire my Cockney accent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With quality in mind. The dvd of this movie is excellent. Commentary et al. (Spoilers!!!)In comparing with the 2000 version, this one had more depth to it. Nowadays it's like, we're afraid to show nudity. Land of the free, with a first amendment and movies like Eyes Wide Shut get censored or they don't shoot the film. I really hate that. So here's a movie that's 30 yrs old, that outshine's the 2000 version. Kinda like a Dirty Harry movie, it has much action in a movie made in it's time. I'm amazed.Biggest change is (and Michael Caine comments on the fact that americans don't like their hero's, or villains killed) So it's no surprise that Stallone has this hippy go lucky ending, while Michael Caine's version has himself killed because we are made to hate him and he hate's himself. It's one of the best movies I've discovered.9/10(These are just a few main factors that went into my rating.) Quality: 10/10 Replayable: 9/10 Entertaining: 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the question that continues to haunt me about this film, is, why does jack carter want to avenge his brother - that question may seem off the wall; modern western audiences have long accepted, as established fact, that revenge is generally a good thing, a kind of 'wild justice' as a philosopher once called it.outside of being utterly wrong and inevitably leading to unnecessary violence, this attitude makes it difficult to raise the really difficult question concerning any one particular act of revenge, namely, what is the real motivation to it. for, on reflection, it is clear that not everyone attempting revenge does so for the same reason. the two brief moments in this film when carter meets his niece warn us that there is something very profoundly wrong going on here. he has no relationship with her at all, and really doesn't want one. he is certainly outraged when he discovers that she was seduced into making a pornographic film, but when he confronts the person who accidentally shows him the film he makes it clear that much of his outrage has to do with his family name - a very odd bit of pride for someone who has apparently spent of his adult life avoiding going home to visit the folks. and when he confronts one of the makers of the film, he does remark that the 'doreens of this world' - that is, the young women victimized in this fashioned - have no one to fight for them, which suggests that he intends to do just that - which partly explains why he informs on the porn-ring to the police, something very odd for a professional criminal to do. yet despite all this, i remain unconvinced - for instance, he has no qualms at all about murdering a prostitute who is clearly as much a victim of this porn-ring as his niece.but if i read the one scene aright, where he reminds one of the porn-ring that his niece's name is 'carter - my name is carter', that carter is here most offended by the abuse of someone bearing the family name, then carter's motivation becomes a little more clear; he isn't avenging his brother at all, he's avenging himself. which clearly makes him one of the most self-centered 'revengers' in film history.what hodge - borrowing inspiration from the lee Marvin film point blank - and Caine have done is to lure us into a frame of mind such that we expect carter to at last prove himself heroic, or perhaps tragic, or in some other way tangibly human - only to reveal the painful truth that he is none of these. he is every bit as rotten to the core as those he attacks. but how does someone like this, who has lived most his life in the shadows of the underworld, develop such a pride in the family name that he is willing to give up everything for it - and why; these questions can't be properly posed or answered here; and actually i as yet have no answer. but clearly something, some value, that sustained jack carter's survival got lost back home when he wasn't paying attention to it. when he first sets out on his quest, he seems to think he can fight to get it back; by the end of the film, it's clear he has no where left to go.an unsentimental character study of a pitiless criminal in a pitiless underworld. tough stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie's an ice-cold exercise in revenge, with a no-nonsense script and a first-rate turn by Caine as the heck-bent avenger. Someone killed his brother and, by golly, they're going to pay along with anyone else who gets in his way. The idea's not new; what's different is that Carter (Caine) has almost no redeeming qualities. He's about as cold blooded as the worst of the gangsters he confronts. Rooting for him is like rooting for a stomach pain over a headache.Then too, Caine's ice-blue eyes are put to good use in sizing up his targets. And catch that gear shifting in the fast car timed to coincide with Carter's fast action on the bed. At last the subtext of all those sleek auto advertisements is revealed, this time in high octane. I just wish we saw more of Ms. Ekland, both literally and especially figuratively. And if that's not enough, catch that great ending. It's a marvel of imaginative staging and a perfect cap to what's gone before. Anyway, the movie reminds me of a polished piece of glass-- just about as cold and shiny and needing no depth. I couldn't stop looking at it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Carter, the reserved London gangster, travels north to Newcastle, his home town, to find the cause of his brother's death. He's warned by his bosses not to go, but refuses to obey them. We, and he, discover the reasons for the warning, which are intertwined with the details of his brother's fate, and watch Carter's quest for revenge reach its logical conclusion. The underworld life sets a kitschy vision of glamour - music-box decanter sets, flashy bespoke suits, and garishly decorated villas - against the grotty reality of arcade slot machines, pornographic 8mm films, and the claustrophobic grubbiness of Newcastle's industrial tenements. Carter, who prides himself on a style of detached shrewdness, navigates both worlds, until he discovers that they're intertwined, sickeningly. The corruption which provides him his living has tainted his own family. I think the centre of the film is the brilliant moment when Carter sits in bed in the flickering light of a projector, discovering the truth about his world. He weeps, silently, knowing what he must now do. But vengeance is all he knows, and it consumes him. This story captures with great subtlety the coarse truths about poverty, and crime, which are as true today in Canada and the US as they were forty years ago in England. There's no heroism, no loyalty, no glamour. We fear Carter's emptiness, even though we feel a kind of sorrowful revulsion when we see the reality of his world, and his role in it. And we realise we've seen a perfect film of its kind - exceptionally skillful acting, cinematography and editing, bringing to life a taut script. We'll never fall for the false romanticism of crime again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Better than The Third Man, for my money, which is usually put forward as best UK film ever, and probably the best gangster movie in England ever. It's really a film noir in the vein of The Big Combo or The Big Heat, and Hodges uses Boorman's Point Blank as his template for this adaptation of the book - but never gets as existential as that movie. It's got '60's hipness, a few slightly dodgy/unconvincing accents, but a reaL nasty nihilism that sets it apart from other movies - even The Long Good Friday. Caine is unique and carries the film as well as a Dick Hammer or Philip Marlowe played by a Hollywood heavyweight. It's brilliant - see it!</fullReview>

When he is offered a ticket out of town, his suspicion about his brother's death grows stronger. His investigation leads him to a pornography ring and lots of bad guys.There's lots of violence in this film as Carter dispenses with anyone who's in his way without even blinking. He's mean as they come. Caine is fantastic, and he's surrounded by effective evil-doers.There's nudity, too, as well as phone sex. If you like this type of gangster movie, you'll love this.

		<shortDescription>Violence Breeds Violence, Which Breeds More Violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes, a gang-related murder is so well covered up that only another gangster may suspect it was a gang-related murder. And if a gangster is the one who will carry out justice, it's going to be carried out in the ugly, unrelenting way a gangster will do it. That means that anyone who gets in his way, and anyone of whom he can take advantage, is subject to be tortured, beaten, killed, et cetera. Such is the case with Jack Carter's suspicion that his brother's death was no drunk driving accident.If other, more powerful gangsters are those who a gangster seeking personal vengeance must confront, there will naturally be attempts to administer a taste of his own medicine to throw him off the trail, to run him out of town, to rub him out completely. This, as it does in the case of such a brutal brand of justice, simply makes matters worse. First of all, if what can loosely be referred to as his colleagues want him out of town so bad, it is a clear sign that his suspicions have been correct, so not only is he going to retaliate, his brutal plans are going to become even more brutal now. There is a revelation as to the reason for his brother's death that sends him, in a figurative sense, and someone else, in a literal sense, over the edge. Revenge ensues summarily, though director Mike Hodges, like Boorman before him and Soderbergh after, appreciates the boundaries of fatalism, the development toward the truth leading into the ocean, soggy and gloomy.Violence breeds violence, which breeds more violence in this enjoyable British gangster picture, a seminal film for Michael Caine, who sharpened his ability in his string of crime films in the 1960s, particularly in this one, to give such a charismatic and arresting performance as a character who has no intention---and neither do the filmmakers---of making us like him. Get Carter is also a piece of efficient and effective stylistic economy. The spare, stationary camera-work is first-rate, capturing whole scenes in single unobtrusive let stylishly done takes, and Jack Carter's vicious and merciless revenge plays out against the backdrop of smoke-filled pubs, private social clubs and derelict urban housing, shot on location, a very clever approach as it includes intriguing spots like an apparently well-known raw concrete multi-storey parking garage with a rooftop caf and a level in the process of being developed into a restaurant. This is the location for an utterly clean and graceful defenestration only the coolest gangland cucumber could execute so swiftly. There is also a gripping chase along a black industrial shoreline littered with piles of coal. Ultimately, a great deal of its charm comes from incidental detail.That doesn't stop with the shrewd visuals. It's also in the distinctive jazz score, which is a welcome convention of the era's crime pictures, as well as the unapologetically down-home Cockney dialogue, a sort of precursor to the pervasive quotability of Guy Ritchie's contemporary East End thug throwbacks. Like Ritchie's popular Brit grit, Get Carter is what notoriously tough critic Pauline Kael referred to at the time of its release as "calculated soullessness," a description I can't put it any better as it is essentially a sadomasochistic testosterone dream full of business suits, sawn-off pump action shotguns and payback time, but it's all so clever and intelligently pulled off. Unlike Ritchie's whirlwind-speed genre exercises and what makes Hodges' much more laconic film a drag at times is the transparent attempt at idolizing Carter as a Hugh Hefner-type playboy who effortlessly gets a woman off via phone and nails even his temporary landlady despite the harm he causes her. All women in the film are purely sex objects, not characters. However, unlike Ritchie's films and what makes Get Carter more interesting overall is that it makes little to no attempt to be endearing, light-hearted or funny; its title character is cold-blooded, cruel and even unkind.In spite of its indulgences and what would become Hodges' signature lagging pace, Get Carter is a taut, potent procedural that doesn't bother with pious platitudes about the inability to live with a guilty conscience, that one doesn't want to see oneself as a bad guy, and instead gives us what is probably a much more realistic rendering of a gangster inhabiting a gang-controlled world, a guy who's content to see himself as a "villain," as he calls himself. There's a pervading mood in all storytelling media that's inclined to teach us the way to behave through showing us right-thinking people as our protagonists, which never comes across as particularly believable in crime films, even good ones. Here is a movie that isn't afraid to show a bad guy brutalizing other bad guys than which he's no better, as well as some halfway decent people, and the only reason he is the protagonist is because he's reacting instead of instigating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior gangster film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Caine deserves all the plaudits he has received for this film. He shoulders the burden of the story with ease (there are very few scenes where he doesn't appear). His Jack Carter is calculating and uncaring, happy to murder or cause hurt to anyone who stands in his way ? even if, as the cases of Keith, Glenda or Albert, he knows they are innocent. His dead eyes reveal a cold spirit, and you never for a moment feel that he's morally superior to any of the other characters. You're not even sure whether his quest to find his brother's killer is prompted by fraternal revenge or by simple rebelliousness against those telling him to pack it in and go home. There's no attempt (thankfully) to humanise him or find "reasons" for his criminality, as in so many poorer pictures. And yet you're carried along with Carter, fascinated by his destruction of the Newcastle criminal infrastructure.We see the different faces of gangsterism close up. The violence, the amorality, the sexism we've seen in countless other films. But here we also see in detail the many quirks that we know real gangsters are prone to: cleanliness fetish (Carter obsessively polishing his British Rail spoon), hypochondria (Carter's apparently useless nose drops and pills), cruelty (Carter taunting his frustrated landlady in the famous phone sex scene), sentimentality (Carter crying at the Teacher's Pet porn film, while having demonstrated little interest in his niece ? or possibly daughter ? Doreen), callousness (his lack of compassion towards Keith after he is beaten up), fussiness (wanting his beer in a tall glass not a mug), foolish bravado (Carter walking naked into a street full of marching band members, carrying his shotgun), and untrustworthiness (Carter and Kinnear make a deal, selling out a fellow villain, then right away doublecross each other.) Then there's the chilling sight of Eric Paice's terrified eyes when Carter pulls off his shades ? many a real-life gangster would understand that.Each time I see this film, and I've seen it probably two dozen times ? I'm always taken by the clarity of the narrative, by the well rounded characters (even those in bit parts), by the haunting Roy Budd score. But it needs to be said that, to the film's benefit, a number of unusual risks have been taken. For instance, the depiction of the characters benefits from offbeat casting. Glenda (Geraldine Moffat), Edna (Rosemary Dunham), Doreen (Petra Markham), Peter (Tony Beckley) and other well chosen actors fit their parts perfectly. Caine makes no attempt to hide his grown up, pale, lumpy body even when naked. The violence is not gratuitous, but when it appears we are shown its shocking effects full on. Plus, it also must have taken some courage to set the film in Newcastle ? not usually first choice as a location for major films ? which here, largely owing to the excellent Wolfgang Suschitsky photography, becomes a character in its own right.</fullReview>

He has absolutely no redeeming qualities which makes it impossible to care about what happens to him.I think that come the end - when he takes a bullet to the head - it's meant to be a surprise and somehow sad; if so then the script fails on both counts.He gets what he's had coming to him and frankly, it comes as a relief.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get a hold of Get Carter, and one of Britain's better crime genre efforts from over the decades as low-level; Northern set revenge takes centre stage.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sorts of different directions Mike Hodges weaves his 1971 film, entitled Get Carter, are seamless in their execution and all of frightening; dramatic; tension filled and somewhat humorous on separate occasions. Watching the film now is a plunge into a time and a place that only those whom were directly involved can speak of in whatever capacity they deem fit. It is the north of England which is the playground wherein a series of sordid; seedy and illegal events play out under a collective umbrella of both the gangster and noir genres with a bloody tale of revenge acting as the cherry on top. Nobody wins in Hodges' universe, and ninety percent of the losers get agonising and quite frightening fatal blows ? that adds up to a lot of pain contained within.There was a tidbit off of a plot synopsis that I read somewhere around about the time I first saw Get Carter, something that drew parallels with Britain and its 'boom' decade of the "swinging sixties" and how Get Carter was the jolt to the infrastructure which woke everyone up and pushed everyone into a new decade-plus-supposed era. The fun was over; the nature of what was really going on underneath was floating to the surface as everybody was forced to grow up out of bubble cars; a football World Cup win and Beatles music. Unfolding in Newcastle; a certain Jack Carter (Caine) wanders the streets and hares down the roads in search of the truth behind his brother Frank's murder. It's a journey that unfolds in a place that sees tall, grey factories churning out smoke which cover the skies creating with a dim, grayish tint for it inhabitants to work under. But it could all be unfolding anywhere; Hodges avoids obvious iconography and his only signalling of the city of Newcastle arrives in the form of a station platform sign very early that you could miss if you blinked.We're first introduced to Jack as he's sitting in a room full of shifty nobodies with smut and sleaze, the very items of his eventual pent-up rage exploding, up on the wall for all to see by way of a projector. This, as a women who looks like big trouble, sits close by him. Such a scene establishes the sorts of people Carter's journey will encompass and the sorts of material he'll stumble upon. The mobsters, observing pornographic slides, laugh and tell him that the police have all the business involving Frank sorted. Jack retorts with a line somewhere along the lines of "Since when did anyone pay an attention to what they ever said"; and with that, he's off on the train to do some serious digging around.Hodges does really well in keeping his lead on a fine line between hero and anti-hero; there are times you come to despise Carter, there are others in which he comes across as a man on a 'just' or heroic mission in bringing down certain people nastier than him whilst using some pretty immoral methods to do so. Regarding the brother, not many people come to Frank's funeral while one woman barges in late without much regret. The sheer ruthlessness of the film's tone, particularly in its attitude toward the dead as prolonged by the noir-infused lead, is perfectly captured when a vicar is giving what should be a heartfelt and emotional service on top of a large underground area in which the coffin comes down and is wheeled off into the kiln so that the ashes may be garnered. That sense of disregard towards human life felt apparent here, but that attention to what's 'below the surface' (below the altar, in this case) additionally felt apparent.When Carter arrives in Newcastle, there is no fancy establishing shot to tell us we're there; it's just out off of the train and straight into the fire as the black of night and the hustling, bustling, smoky locale of a public house greets us. The fact that Jack's doing everything he does for the 'truth' behind his brother aids in us being able to relate to him; his mission, you feel, is born out of heart. Indeed, the first sign of trouble is not instigated by him, but that's not to say he doesn't enjoy it. This when a footman, named Thorpe, comes to take him home again. Later, a local lad named Keith accuses Carter of leaving him all alone when he knew the gangsters would come back to his locale, to which Carter protests he didn't think they would. Very gradually, through means of violence and other characters coming to natural conclusions, we begin to wonder if Carter is as nice-a guy as we'd initially thought.There's a superb scene at a race track which is a confrontation between Carter and a driver named Eric. Once this has concluded, the transitional edit from race horse bolting from the gate to a car speeding off down a lane, quickly followed by Carter's, captures the essence of Jack's attitude towards his goal which you feel at this point has very much kicked off. The edit captures Carter's eventual attitude along with the horse's during that race: ploughing through everything and jumping fences if and when they come as they chase down that finish post and the glory. I like the film's attention to detail. When Carter evades two heavies by speeding off down a cobbled road housing wall to wall laundry, he gets some of it caught on the windscreen amidst the getaway. Then, when he arrives at his destination, he walks around to the front of the car; tears off the laundry; rolls it up and throws it away, laughing. Such attention to tiny, subtle, realistic and seemingly pointless little things add so much more to a passage of action as well as overall character. Get Carter is a wonderful, pulpy piece of gritty British cinema which ought to be embraced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal, but more to do with imagination that anything visual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 70's seemed to be a rather good year for classic crime movies; Dirty Harry, Get Carter and The French Connection (all 71) The Godfather, Parts I and II and numerous others, though not as classic. So it really is a complement that Get Carter, not only widely regarded as one of the British films of all time, happens to be one of the best Crime Movies of the 70's; and yes, one of the best, and most brutal, ever.The scenery really complements the exceptionally grim atmosphere of the film. The cinematography is damn near perfect; dark alleyways, open, rainy sea, smoky pubs and cobbled paths. But what really shines is the exceptional performance from Michael Caine, playing as a man loyal, and caring, to his family: and mercilessly sadistic to everyone else.It opens with him viewing an array of pornography clips (which play a huge part to the plot in this film) with a variety of crime partners, bosses, and whores, and then his journey up to Newcastle where he finds, unexpectedly his brother in a coffin. Sounds cheery, eh? He's determined to find out who did it, even if it means gagging naked women and injecting them to death, leaving them in trunks and watching them fall to sea, torturing two men before killing them (with a chisel, and pushing another off a building) being mean, seedy and unpleasant and having sex in his spare time.I won't spoil it, but the main point that strings the whole thing together is a punch to the gut and a kick in the teeth. It is in a nasty, horrible, unbearable scene to watch: but it stands as the best. After so long with a character who seems to care for nothing, and thrives on violence, you will be shocked to see him shed a tear. And, amazingly, even more so than the frankly graphic material that has gone before it.More gritty than Dirty Harry, much more intriguing than The French Connection, less polished than The Godfather (this film has practically zero music, which really adds to the atmosphere) and more bleak, gritty and fantastic than all of them, this still remains a cult movie, but a classic all the same.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darkly poetic look, hypocritical message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film makes incredible use of interiors and locations (and fashion and style). Combined with the minimal acting style (pretty standard for these kinds of films--Melville's Le Samourai, for example), the setting seems to poetically express what's in Jack Carter's soul, ending in a stunning finale. It's a wonderfully cold film, capturing the revenge mood perfectly.Where the film lost me is in its seemingly unconscious double-standard. It develops a theme of (female) innocence corrupted (that one perfect tear!), with Carter smiling warmly at a girl and her mother on the boat. On the other hand the film is grossly exploitive of its actresses, reveling in phone sex and seduction. (Dig the rocking chair scene!) The sex was ok (and seemed daring for its time), but the puritannical streak tries to get it both ways.I thought The Limey (which obviously owes a debt to this film) was much better at portraying an agent of vengeance discovering his own responsibility in the mess he tries so hard to be coldly superior to. Having seen Croupier recently, I feel like Hodges is greatly talented but has something crucial missing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is Class film-making, not to be missed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Newcastle is a place to avoid, well it was back in 1971. This film isn't an advert for a holiday in Newcastle. The picture's realism is fantastic, Newcastle looks horrid, a city with no life just a home for crime.The direction is gritty, the photography is realistic, dark and unhealthy. I love this aspect of the picture.Caine is fantastic. Every line is delivered perfectly, although intentionally wooden it works superbly. The film isn't as violent as one would expect, it's very real. The gangsters of this world do not kill anyone or anybody, and this aspect is very important in the film. The supporting crew are perfect, I wasn't impressed with Brit Ekland, the only disappointment, she didn't have much to do.The plot is simple, but there is a lot to think about it.Enjoy it, this is class British film-making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get Carter, before Carter gets you.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They say revenge is sweet. But, revenge can also be sour. How can revenge can be sweet and sour? Well, consider this: why not take a simple idea and expand on the general idea of vengeance? That would work very well. And in the case of Get Carter, that premise is very appealing.The movie begins with Jack Carter, (Michael Caine), an London gangster who is on his way to his hometown in Newcastle. Once he steps off the train, he visits his dear brother, Frank, or so it seems. Carter finds out that Frank is dead. His body can be found in a open casket in the upstairs bedroom of his house. When Carter realizes this, his suspicions start to flare up. Frank's closest friends of the English mob tell Carter that he died in a car accident. But, he doesn't buy the story. Carter soon begins his own investigation where he soon finds out that his brother didn't died in a car accident. Instead, he thinks that someone killed his brother. Soon enough, Jack's enemies tries to persuade Carter to leave town. But, Carter doesn't listen. He isn't leaving till he finds out who killed his brother. Jack's girlfriend, Anna, (Britt Ekland), also sees his behavior starting to grow differently. Carter's investigation leads him to the London criminal underworld where pornography, murder, and even betrayal starts to leak out. The movie does have a very well thought-out story that isn't like any other revenge picture I've seen. Most revenge are single-minded. Take a movie like Death Wish. In that film, the revenge part was single-minded. But in this film, it isn't. To me, the character that Caine plays acts like a detective and the irony in the story is that he is actually righting the wrongs. The moral ambiguity that is being presented is very different from other crime movies. Carter is stirring up trouble in Newcastle and he is just the right man to do the job. He isn't about to let anybody get in his way. Not even his old mob enemies. Caine gives, what I think, a very memorable performance. He's vicious when he is and also very slick when it comes to doing his business.The way the criminal underworld works is very well done. The look and feel of the underworld is so grimy and so sleazy that it actually fits perfectly with the premise. In fact, the characters' way of communicating to one another is very interesting because these people aren't the kind to be around. They're angry and frustrated to one another. Even more specifically, the women are not even hurt by the way they are treated in this underworld. The reason why is that they are part of this underworld, which is filled with anguish and rage. It's almost as if this film is like a piece of pulp crime literature. The characters are well written and very acted so that we're really following this story as it takes us all across Newcastle.Besides the crime matter, I also enjoy the relationship between Carter and his girlfriend. There's a sense of erotic tension between the two including a scene where Carter performs a phone sex act on his girlfriend and we definitely see how Carter not only act like a detective, but also a tool of seduction. He can be rough, but he can act cool since he creates a vibrant atmosphere in the movie. The dialogue between Carter and his girlfriend and also his peers are very well- written and strong. I have to say I like listening to these characters talk to each other. After Get Carter, other British gangster films were followed. One of them was the 1980 film, "The Long Good Friday", with Bob Hopkins. Like Get Carter, The Long Good Friday also a real gritty perspective of the English mob. More importantly in both films, the violence creates a sense of intimidation on the characters, especially the victims.The movie is a slick, well-written film that holds a unforgettable performance by Michael Caine and others. It works as both a British gangster film and also a piece of pulp crime. &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; 1/2 3 1/2 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The birth of British gangster films -79%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American audiences have long been drawn to the tale of the loner seeking a justice that the law can't provide. From gritty westerns to hard-boiled private eyes, Hollywood continues to provide stories showing that revenge is a positive thing. But here in the UK, we don't have that sort of mentality. This is arguably the closest to a classic quest for vengeance as we've produced and sure enough, this movie is as cold and barren as the city it's set in. This is a world with no heroes and a sketchy moral compass and like "Point Blank" or (for modern movie-goers) "Payback", this is one of those films when bad people do bad things to badder people.East End gangster Jack Carter (Michael Caine) returns to his hometown of Newcastle in the north of England after his brother dies in a drink-driving incident. However, Jack smells a rat and begins to look into things. A complex web of lies, secrets and criminality soon emerges and Jack is forced to root through Newcastle's underworld in order to find out who killed his brother including local crime boss Kinnear (John Osborne) and shady businessman Cliff Brumby (Brian Mosley). But Jack's London colleagues aren't too happy either..."Get Carter" is a tough film to watch, even by modern standards. Caine, in a role that's the polar opposite of Charlie Croker from "The Italian Job" a few years earlier, is a mean son-of-a-gun and isn't afraid to indulge in the dark side to get things done. It's a shock to see him slap women about or show a total lack of remorse for his actions, regardless of who gets hurt. It's also a tough story to follow, mirroring the sort of Raymond Chandler novels that this film aspires to. But not only is this a hard-as-nails revenge thriller but there is something else, a faint whiff of coolness that blows through the picture. Caine, whilst playing a pretty unlikeable character, is magnetic as Carter, infusing a macabre humour into this darkest of roles. The soundtrack is also first-class - not especially prominent but the theme that plays over the opening credits simply works brilliantly well."Get Carter" remains one of the most unique British pictures I can think of. It's hugely influential and is now considered iconic - hard to imagine Guy Ritchie having a career without this to base "Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels" on. It's a harsh but exciting ride through a side of society that Brits don't often see portrayed on these shores. Without Caine, this would have been a fairly forgettable flick but Caine's charisma and star quality shine through an otherwise grey and grim movie. It is also, as if you couldn't guess, so much better than Sly Stallone's half-arsed remake. Looks like my resolution is watch more older movies might not be so bad after all if they can match the quality on display here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic crime film, highly recommended</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is scarily realistic; no glamourization whatsoever of gangsters or violence or even of sex. Michael Caine's best role and best acting ever. Jack Carter keeps it all inside. No emotion save fury ever shows. He's cold and calculating, with no regard for anyone but himself. He's one of those street-level enforcers who everyone in his environment (including the bosses) has to respect at all times because there will be consequences for crossing him, no matter what your position in the hierarchy. Other gangsters give him plenty of room and everyday citizens are automatically frightened whenever he wants them to be. He's not kidding around; he's always ready for horrific violence and he knows how to kill people and get away with it."Get Carter" starts out slowly and in a leisurely fashion. Jack reveals himself only through his actions. There's no exposition and little dialogue. There's a growing sense that Jack is actually more motivated by the disrespect shown to him personally by the killing of his brother, and not so much by any fraternal love on his part. The audience gradually catches on as to what a monster the hero of the movie truly is. We think he's friendly toward his late brother's young friend Keith but he just ruthlessly uses him as a pawn, much to Keith's detriment. Poor Keith gets quite an extensive, first-hand education in what gangsters are really all about. Same for Jack's luckless landlady, although she was no dummy to begin with. Jack callously puts her in harm's way to save himself and then discards her without a backwards glance. Later on, he coldly watches another woman die a horrible, screaming death without intervening. It needs to be added that he'd also had sex with both women immediately prior to their unfortunate fates, but had obviously incurred no sentiment toward either of them during their time together. His only moments of normal human emotion are when he gives money to his niece and Keith. He also lets Keith verbally abuse him, an act which would normally incur a fearsome price, and his restraint does in fact indicate a tiny bit of sympathy on Jack's part. But on both occasions he's holding a big roll of bills and we see him deciding how much to give. Why doesn't he just give them the whole wad? He obviously has plenty of money and the capacity to get a great deal more. Also, when he sees his niece in a porno flick he sheds a couple tears. But he's all alone at the time and apparently it never even occurs to him to go help and protect the niece. His only reaction is pitiless rage and bloodlust towards the perpetrators.Caine's performance is extremely subtle and all the more powerful for it. There's no emoting, no ham, no explosions, no garbage; just meat and gristle and bone. All the supporting cast is top-notch with no missteps by any of them. The violence is painful to watch and impressively immediate and graphic and real and is very carefully measured out and is never gratuitous. Some of the violence even happens off-screen instead of being exploited and thrown at the audience for a cheap thrill. This film was badly mishandled in America although it very deservedly became a cult favorite. Made in 1971 it still holds up effortlessly and with no dated feeling whatsoever. Fascinating film for those in the mood for something very solid and skillful. Please make sure to watch this one and not that Sylvester Stallone abortion.</fullReview>

This brutal , austere crime-thriller focuses a cheerless enforcer Jack Carter (Michael Caine) , a tough , amoral gangster who works as a killer at the town . Magnificent Michael Caine in the title role , he's a hit-man who returns home to investigate his brother's death by some mobsters . Two-fisted Jack in order to revenge his sibling , vows vengeance and spontaneously meets sleazy characters (Ian Hendry, Mosley) in the middle of sinister bands war and running afoul into underworld .

Carter aware the murder of his brother at the hands of a "gang" opponent led by a mobster (John Osborne) . As he decides to travel his natal Newcastle to investigate who is responsible . This city in northern England is portrayed as a cool place , foggy , sordid , rainy , dirty , gray and industrial aspect . Carter starts moving in this ambient , full of sad pubs , horse races , buildings almost in ruins , piers of black water and ravaged aspect postindustrial , which had almost erased from his memory . While we see as his facade of sophisticated and elegant Londoner gentleman with exquisite manners , educated pose, and expensive costumes , begins collapsing , leaving see the lascivious, malleability and cold killer . All of this ends up in the discovery of X film involving his niece what angry Jack Carter enormously . This triggers a wave of violence that sweeps the the underworld lumpen in northern England . Carter keeps the things moving along until ending vendetta. The end of the film is like a summary of the entire story for the scenarios that uses austere bleak and cold environment.This interesting film features thrills , raw energy ,adult subject matter with abundant nudism , lots of violence and enlivened by high-powered performances . Plenty of intrigue, atmospheric music , kinky sex ,noisy action and grisly killings until impressive finale vengeance . It is a movie very violent , depressing charismatic , magnificently set , but always strong , with a perfect abstraction of a climate of moral misery to game with the cold environment and ramshackle scenarios well photographed by cameraman Wolfgang Suschitzky . Adequate musical score by Roy Budd with a rare mixture , the dark psychedelia of the movement "Northen Soul" , so fashionable in the proletarian clubs from the north of England of the 70s .This British 1971 film "GET CARTER is an original movie and is far superior subsequent 1972 remake , a Black Gangster version titled The hit-man, a Blaxploitiation movie regularly directed by George Armitage with Bernie Casie , Pam Grier , Roger E Mosley and Paul Gleason .

		<shortDescription>A film full of unforgettable moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched GET CARTER again this week, exactly 40 years since it debuted in British cinemas. Initially neglected at the time ? it received a single BAFTA nomination (Ian Hendry as Supporting Actor which he didn't win) ? nowadays it makes legitimate claim to be one of the all-time great British movies. Its influence is still felt in British drama: on the DVD of the BBC's LIFE ON MARS, they cite GET CARTER as one of the influences for the look and tone of the series and the 1974 segment of RED RIDING owes everything to CARTER.Written and directed by Mike Hodges, the film centres on Carter (Michael Caine), a London gangster who ? against his employer's wishes ? travels home to North East England in order to get to the bottom of his brother's sudden death. Everything is linked to the local chief criminal Kinnear (playwright and screenwriter John Osborne), a porn film in which Carter's niece has been coerced to appear and assorted villains determined to stand in Carter's way. There isn't a dull or wasted scene in the entire movie. It's not just a gangster revenge thriller ? it's a film of details and social observations of working class and criminal life from the early 1970s. The details of the long train journey up North which accompany the opening credits. The details of life in the bleak and drab Newcastle of 1971 which the affluence of the Swinging sixties has passed by. It's a film in which everyone is either a villain or victim. These characters have little sense of life beyond their limited horizons. Carter is getting out of it all ? he's about to flee to South America with his boss's mistress.It's social realism at its most piercing. Check out the scene in which the hitherto hard as nails Carter sees his niece being abused in a porn film and he starts crying - one of Caine's most memorable and harrowing screen moments. And the final moment on a grey desolate beach early on a Sunday morning under a leaden sky, Carter casting his shotgun into the sea having killed all of the people linked to his brother's death ? only to be shot dead by a sniper. This is is a film full of unforgettable moments too numerous to mention here. Superb is every way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No more Mr. Nice Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the cheery 60's, this marked the beginning of a cynical tone in the medium. I have not read the novel, and can make no comparisons. On the other hand, I have watched the overstylized remake that tries way too hard. What is "cool"? Well, it changes with time and culture. However, a surefire indication is that it appears effortless. When you are putting energy into something... well, it can still be bad-ass. Anyway, Caine doesn't need to be introduced while he is running or to literally look like he's about to burst out of his suit(not to mention how uncomfortable Sly looked in his) from sheer muscle to be intimidating ever moment that he's on-screen. Then there's the contrasting amount of talent. Michael delivers a powerful and largely understated performance, and in general, the acting in this is great. This is not Hollywood; it's very old-school, and it fits the British(note the slang in this picture) gangster, working class environment that it is set in(not attempting to hide it, rather, it puts us right in it, insisting on grittiness and avoiding glamour), with cinematography that comes off as real and dirty. There are some interesting angles and framing, and the editing can be startling and "unfriendly"(we may be hearing two conversations at the same time, for example). This moves at a gradual pace, building up towards the conclusion. The bits of chasing and exciting action hit us like a punch in the dark; we do not expect anything, and the effect is marvelous. FX are fine. In addition to our lead being an anti-hero, there are not many innocent characters in this. There is a bit of nudity and sexuality(plenty of legs belonging to hot chicks) as well as a little strong language, bloody(even if the red of it is "wrong") violence and disturbing content in this. The DVD comes with an informative and fun commentary(with the star, the director and the D.P.), a music-only track(that highlights the sparse use of such in this... and that theme is masterful, simple yet haunting) and three trailers(and yes, you can tell that they were made back then, when previews were done in a different way than today). I recommend this to any fan of English movies and/or anyone who took part in making this. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Get Carter was Mike Hodges' first feature film after starting out in TV. It is also -from my perspective- Hodges's most stylish film and if you watch the very first and highly symbolic scene, Caine in a penthouse with an almost unreal quality to the scene, curtains closing in on him. Although it's a tough revenge movie we know it's going downhill for him. There are many very stylish shots in the film aided by extremely effectively used sound effects like the ever howling wind. But between the shots of scenes with extremely cold blooded violence, urband decay there are also some incredibly funny scenes like Cater naked with a gun out in the street where are band is marching or the phone sex conversation Caine has with Ekland (phoarr!) just to turn on the landlady who is listening while sitting in a rocking chair- sexy, very funny and it shows how manipulative Carter is. Cater is a character the audience somehow cares about but whenever there is a danger of actually liking him Hodges will remind us of what a ruthless and amoral character he is. Get cater is based on a novel by Ted Lewis, the god father of British hardboiled. Hodges who also wrote the screenplay, did not change much except the location (Newcastle instead of Doncaster) and so Get cater is a mix of kitchen sink drama and film noir. And one of the enduring memories I have of the film is the incredible poverty in the Northeast in the early 70s. Get Carter is also ground breaking in the sense that I don't think nudity has ever been shown to that extent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iconic Caine role that he successfully pulled off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning London gangster Jack Carter (Michael Caine) travels up north to Newcastle to investigate the mysterious death of his brother. Along the way, he crosses paths with the love of his life, some of the local big time villains and his young niece who is stuck in the pornographic film industry.In the time when he was at the height of his leading man success, Michael Caine raised his profile with this grittier leading man role. This is at odds with some of the more light hearted, flimsier stuff he was famous for, like Alfie and The Italian Job, but he's a professional with the material and delivers the goods as can be expected. The working class northern backdrop is suitably grim and depressing looking and sets the mood just right for the story at hand. It's quite an old film now, but it's lost none of it's heavy tone and it feels just as unflinching now as it was back then. Of course, it may have lost a bit of power now, but it's one of the original, iconic Brit gangster flicks that set the tone of many that were to come and still will. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this together with "The Silencers." The two were roughly contemporary and both played with notions of cool. There is a sort of symmetry here that I think is intrinsic to cool.It is a symmetry of misogynism. The idea with Dean Martin's thing is probably more familiar to most viewers through Austin Powers. Martin is basically an ugly thug whose fame was based on fantasies about the rat pack. But we are to believe that women ? here as automatons with pink bits ? automatically adjust to him as god merely through presence. There are gadgets and settings too, and everything emanates from the being of the man. Cinematically speaking, it is Italian storytelling.Here in Carter we have something else. Its the same pull on values. The man has charm, enough that every woman in his orbit gets seduced and suffers. But the entire dynamic is different. Its the environment here that is the focus, not the man. Unfortunately, this film has not aged well and we have much, much better examples of cool ground out from a gritty machine.This guy is a genuine thug. To be cool in this mold you cannot be violent. You have to be an observer, one who understands the workings of the machine that surrounds. Small insights into those workings give great advantage. The cinematic expression of that dynamic is not groundbreaking in this film. But it is there, is gritty in a human way and gives a worthy ending as the machine grinds on, another viewer somewhere having gotten some small advantage.I have not seen the remake, I think. But it is hard to imagine it working as well. This, by the way, was when Caine was real and true. When he understood this business of what I call folded acting, where he could spend some energy being the character, and some being in the character of an actor playing the guy. Two, simultaneous conversations with us, one with us as a watcher.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You're a big man, but you're in bad shape"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1971 was the year when mainstream filmmakers began to the push the limits of what was acceptable to show on screen, both in terms of sex and violence. Stanley Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange (1971)' enthralled and disgusted audiences on both sides of the Atlantic, picking up a surprise Oscar nomination for Best Picture but later being voluntarily withdrawn from circulation by its director. Sam Peckinpah's 'Straw Dogs (1971)' shocked audiences with its uncompromising exploration of inherent human violence and vigilantism. Likewise, 'Get Carter (1971),' from director Mike Hodges, is an incredibly gritty underworld gangster film, so much so that you can almost taste the gravel between your teeth. It won't escape your notice that all three of these films are British, or, at least, were produced with substantial British input; apparently, it took Hollywood a few more years to become quite as well accustomed to such themes, although that year's Best Picture-winner, 'The French Connection (1971),' does rival 'Get Carter' as far as grittiness goes.Jack Carter (Michael Caine) is a London gangster, an entirely unglamorous occupation that entails such duties as gambling, murder and watching pornography. After his brother, Frank, dies in Newcastle under suspicious circumstances, Jack goes up there, against the wishes of his employer, to find out exactly what happened, and to punish all those responsible. What he finds is the usual assortment of sleazy low-lifes and lascivious whores, all part of the underground lifestyle into which he sold himself. 'Get Carter' obviously derived a degree of influence from the trashy pulp-fiction novels of Raymond Chandler and Mickey Spillane, and, indeed, this inspiration is openly acknowledged when Carter is seen reading "Farewell My Lovely" {adapted by Edward Dmytryk as 'Murder, My Sweet (1944)'}. Like many of the hard-boiled anti-heroes of 1940s and 50s film noir, he has sold his soul for a chance at revenge, and there's no going back. A detail worth noting (and I couldn't have noticed this by myself) is that Carter's eventual assassin is first spotted during the opening credits, sitting opposite in the train carriage. A cruel coincidence, or was his fate sealed from the very beginning?'Get Carter' may have served as inspiration to the recent generation of British gangster film, but the Quentin Tarantino/Guy Ritchie style of film-making favoured today ? the most notable example of which being 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998)' ? is often excessively trendy and highly stylised. Mike Hodges' idea of a gangster film is ugly ? disgustingly and uncomfortably repellent, offering not a glimmer of respectability nor nobility in its selection of depraved characters. Even Jack Carter himself is not a man we are asked to admire. He may have a steady supply of droll one-liners at hand, but at his heart he is cold, almost completely devoid of human emotion. Just watch Carter's stone-face as his car is rammed into the bay (with an unfortunate captive in the boot), or his indifference to the fate of friend Keith (Alun Armstrong), who is thoroughly roughed-up while lending a hand. Hodges appears only to find decency in the deceased Frank, who represents the honest, working-class type of man. However, even this legacy is coming to an end, for the next generation, Doreen, has already been corrupted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yep, this is a '70's movie alright. It has an unmistakable '70's style and atmosphere, with some great camera-work and some small scaled but spectacularly shot action. It also isn't the easiest to watch or easiest to follow movie though, which I found a disappointing aspect of the movie.Thing with "Get Carter" is, is that so many sequences make a redundant impression. While watching it you don't really realize it and wait for something to happen but when a sequence is over and it didn't contributed much to the movie and it's story, you'll feel sort of cheated. Yes, I know, this sort of is also part of '70's film-making and its style but it just didn't made "Get Carter" always the most pleasant movie to watch.Not really the directing or writing its fault. It has a solid story and some tight directing by Mike Hodges. It isn't really an usual crime movie, in which the man character starts blasting everyone away. Instead the movie is more personal and humane and shows a realistic character, dealing with some tough personal situations when his brother dies and he starts to suspect it was foul play.It of course also helps that the main character is being played by Michael Caine, who is of course still successful now days but perhaps did his best work in the '70's and even prior to that. Amazing once you start thinking about the career this man had and still has actually. From playing tough guys and lady-killers early in his career to playing kind old men in his later movies, such as for instance he does now in the new Christopher Nolan Batman movies, as the butler Alfred.A good '70's movie, just not the easiest or most pleasant one to watch.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of what many regard as the 3 classics from 1971, along with Dirty Harry and The French Connection. It is the relentlessly brutal story of Jack Carter's investigation into his brother's death. The opening scene is enough on its own to communicate what Caine's character is like. The cold observing eyes and the dialog reveals the hellish self-counseled character that is Jack Carter. This is a masterpiece performance from one of cinema's greatest.Newcastle is brilliantly chosen as the setting, which is not revealed in the book the film is based on. This run-down, cold and harsh environment mirrors the nature of the story and main character. The slummy appearance causes the audience to infer that this is a crime infested area filled with characters just like the title one.This combination along with the powerful ending creates one of the best films that man has ever made or seen</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My fav film of all time.have seen this over 30 times.captures British film making at its best when at the time America were buying our films believe it or not!!!Jack carter is a man on a mission and is no better than the people he is up against in avenging his brothers death but you get a sense of empathy towards the one man against the mob which carries him all the way through to the brutal end and its pretty grim but realistic pulls no punches has cutting dialogue and great acting throughout.look out for a rare film appearance from john osborne who is frighteningly creepy as kinnear.great film love it!!The film also contains real villains such as john bindon infamous London mobster who turned to acting as sid fletcher but blink and you miss him near the start of the film.also the gritty scenes of old newcastle before re-generation give it a more grimy feel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very British film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably my favourite British film of all time, a tale of a London gangster seeking revenge for his murdered brother. Michael Caine plays Jack Carter who goes from London to his old haunt Newcastle to find the truth about his brothers death. Of course when he gets there all hell breaks loose causing his boss to send other gangsters to go and get him and bring him back to London. One of the reasons Caine made this film was because he was sick of criminals being portrayed as comical and light hearted rascals. Caine had grown up around gangsters and knew they were not the kind of people sixties films had shown them to be. I still believe it one of the most realistic portrayals of a gangster ever put on screen, Caine is brutal unrelenting and cares for no one except his niece . The women in the films are used to his advantage as is the young lad Keith he befriends and then leaves him to get a kicking. The cinematography is stunning showing a Newcastle that has all but disappeared, from the docks to the back streets of the terraced houses. Caine is superb in the leading role showing real menace and delivering some great scenes of dialogue, he is supported well by a largely unknown cast although there is Britt Ekland as his bit on the side back in London and also John Osborne as Newcastles head villain. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes British films and who love gangster movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just plain great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Caine does so many great roles that it would be difficult to pick a best one were it not for Jack Carter. I am normally sceptical on awarding a film on the merits of it's main actor but Caine just oozes menace and really feels like a hard-nut. He dominates the screen but (alongside director Mike Hodges) leaves breathing spaces for the other actors to do act as well as they do. This leaves a feeling of realism and knowing the characters from real life That is not to say that the rest of the film isn't that good. It's all top notch stuff, with the documentary style camera work and use of genuine locations makes for a fantastically gritty feel which goes hand in hand with the sour atmosphere and never lets up. I mean, I can't really believe that Newcastle was that grotty but clearly it was. It certainly doesn't make me feel nostalgic for living in the UK. I think it is mostly the simplicity of the camera work and the fact that there are no flashy visuals that makes it so interesting and exciting to watch. It makes you feel like the whole affair could be happening and probably has quite a few times. Once again, like The Wicker Man and The Italian Job, Get Carter is another example of a great British film's legacy destroyed by a Hollywood remake. I just pray to God that the same fate never befalls Zulu.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the first movies with brilliant on-location photography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched this movie in a newly made print with German subtitles. It has a brilliant photography that grasps the rotten streets of Newcastle, the seventies-style-drunken gangster's paradise and the well-curved bodies of the then state-of-the-art maidens. The D.O.P. Wolf Suschitzky sometimes completely shot with available light - this contributes very much to the qualities of this picture. It has an overall pale and unhealthy look along with deep and rich black due to the low-sensitive stock. Along with BULLITT which used the same techniques three years earlier, GET CARTER brought a new realistic and very violent approach to mafia movies. It completely skips all romanticism and Sicilian family kitsch. The protagonist is unlikeable and sleeps with virtually every woman appearing like drinking a cup of coffee. Bystanders get killed by him with astonishing and unnecessary consequence. Hughes uses advanced cutting techniques: to foreshadow a sex scene he inter-cuts the movement of a gear stick by a nice lady who is driving like a crazy race car driver with the following sex scene of Caine and her. He finishes the sequence with both sitting in the bed and smoking. Here the late sixties and their lust for such experiments come in. Therefore GET CARTER is a fine-balanced mixture between a violent worn out suburban realistic mood and the elegant and sexy elegance that is crucial for films like BULLITT or THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just a great gangster film, but a great drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of my personal favourites. The legendary Michael Caine delivers his meanest, coolest performance, and thankfully ended the Hollywood stereotype that all British gangsters were bumbling prats and British men were weaklings. Caine plays Jack Carter, a gangster who returns to his home town Newcastle Upon Tyne, to investigate the mysterious death of his brother, killed in a supposed drink driving accident. Jack soon discovers he's wanted out of town, and several attempts are made to take him back to London and to kill him, but they don't have a chance while Jack's got his trusty shotgun handy. The plot thickens when Jack discovers that his brother's death wasn't an accident, and was also a cover up for something even more shattering.... Everything in this movie is believable, and makes the film a great drama, not just a tough, gritty crime flick. The action is understated, and all the better for it. The scenery of industrial Newcastle adds a haunting, dank atmosphere few films have ever created. The film isn't perfect - there are some slow bits, but it's the landmark this film has on cinema that deserves its top rating. With films by the likes of Guy Ritchie making up the current British gangster movie market, it's a shame more young people haven't seen this classic, understated original. Besides, it's a much tougher film than a lot of gangster flicks from both sides of the Atlantic. Kudos also to Mike Hodges' direction and Roy Budd's superb music score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is there left to say about 'Get Carter'? Not much probably. For the record though, my two penn'orth is as follows: It works, but it works for a reason. Taking as read that when you gather together an ensemble cast like this, perfunctory stuff like acting quality is inevitable. No one disappoints, and Caine, like Vincent Price, is so much better when he plays it dead straight. He's terrifying here, and once you get over the odd anomaly - why has he lost all traces of a Geordie accent? Was there any police investigation into all these deaths? Why didn't the old bill stop him getting away when they passed him on the way out of the car park after he's sent a pre Coronation Street Alf Roberts to that great grocer shop in the sky - then you can sit back and watch and savour celluloid at its best.Tick in the box - strong plot, logically executed, excellent and expedient characterisation, and of course, tongue in cheek humour and remarkable one liners. Quoting Carter to affectionados is the same closed off club that Pythonists belong to; you quote it and wait for a reaction. If you get none, you know the other guy don't belong! I will always wonder if the inflection in the 'hairy faced git' salutation is really quietly being played for laughs. It always has me in stitches; right up there with 'Mecca, Archer'? I suppose it had to end the way it did, and only the fact that it's clearly not Ian Hendry being tipped into the North Sea just before Jack gets a bullet in the head lets it down a bit. It's either a dummy, or rigor mortis has set in pretty damn quick! This is nit picking though. Film making at its finest. If you haven't seen it, you're missing out. Right, I'm off for a drink 'in a THIN glass'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why do I like this movie? It's pure sleaze. An evil man does evil things. And yet, I can't look away! It's so well done that even my natural aversion to crime movies just evaporates under its influence.Maybe I like Carter because his mission is so compelling. He's out to avenge his brother's death, you see, but he doesn't know who was responsible. In an American movie, he might run around beating people up and demanding information. But in the brainy British tradition, he simply strikes up conversations with everyone in his home town and uses his gray matter to figure out what happened. On a first viewing, when you're not sure what's going on, it might seem slow; but watch it again and you'll see the wheels turning in Carter's head the whole way.Great lines, realistic action, and a wonderfully malevolent Michael Caine. All this, and a couple of "Doctor Who" villains thrown into the mix! Simply awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A glimpse from when it was still "Great" Britain...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was shown in one of the revival houses recently. One of the best things about the movie is a glimpse into Britain's past (Industrial Newcastle, Swinging London, a time when British films had their own voice and language, not as trans-Atlantic Hollywood knock-offs). Many previous posters have mentioned dated elements in the film, but I look at them as virtues, not flaws.Despite a slow start (spent establishing the characters and place), the film rushes towards a glorious, violent climax as Caine, as the title character, discovers how and why his brother was murdered, and exacts a chilling revenge on those responsible.The story aside, I especially enjoyed the details and elements of the setting (fashions, cars, pubs, rituals, racing, social strata) that the director and photographer captures. (q.v. 'Kitchen Sink' realism)Many people have mentioned the phone-sex scene that's worth the price of admission alone - my high point was the hilarious farce of Carter confronted by two enforcers while in bed with his landlady. This is one of the first times in many years where I've laughed out loud in the theater.I think (disagreed by many) that Caine does a terrific job of portraying a hard man in a harsh world. He's the quintessential English lead - stylish, charming, unflappable, able to exude menace and make good on it. For those who compare the film unfavorably with Lock, Stock &amp; Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, et al., I pity you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much more amoral than its source material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Ted Lewis' pulp novel 'Jack's Return Home', the original location was...sunny Scunthorpe. Erm, yes. Mike Hodges took an interesting scenario but vastly improved upon the material including setting it in Newcastle. His Carter is far more amoral than the novel - as is the body count - and the book's ending is ambiguous.The unfamiliar surroundings of Newcastle, echoing Carter's own isolation in an alien environment, make a refreshing change from East End 'manors' etc.The plot is convoluted, the depth of characterisation minimal; Caine is an exterminating angel, the rest of the cast either weak or craven although the playwright John Osborne puts in a wonderfully two-faced turn as the northern crimelord, Kinnear.This film remains the model for many of the god-awful British gangster films that have been influenced by it. Not that Hodges's original should be blamed for the faults of others. At least, Caine's Carter is portrayed as an anti-hero and not some loveable Cockney rogue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A London-based gangster goes back to his roots in the North to attend the funeral of his brother.The low-lifes of the North East, are portrayed faithfully enough by Ian Hendry, John Osborne, and Bryan Mosley. But, what I like most of all about this movie, is the way a grief-striken Jack (Caine) is compelled to declare war on roughly half of Newcastle's underworld... As I'm not permitted to include spoilers, I can't tell you the outcome of this warfare but I will say that it has an ending that's all too believable. There are some great lines uttered by Caine during the course of the film, as he uses all his wit to try to unravell the events surrounding his brother's demise - in fact, this film combines the atmosphere of a thriller, with many a humorous aside; all of which adds to it's entertainment value. All this, and a brilliant score aswell. A must-see film, which doesn't try to be like it's transatlantic counterparts and is all the better for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Get Carter is undeniably one of the finest British films ever made. Set in the Northern town of Newcastle. Carter (played by Caine), a Londan hitman, returns to his home town to discover what happend to his recently deceased Brother. Great Characterisation as well as the coolness which Caine could bring to any film make it unmissable.The most enjoyable aspect of the film has to be Caine's character. We see him as a heartless, cold, murderer who is fazed by nothing, even it seems his brothers own death as shown by the scene where he shaves in the same room as his brothers coffin 10 minutes into the film. He also seems to be a charming character able to say the right thing at any time and able to get his own way when wanted. However as we see in the film his character progressivly becomes more complex, especially when the subject matter turns toward his "niece", where suddenly we see his character become more passionate &amp; less cool.The film is also a fantastic watch just for some of Caine's most memorable quotes. An example is when Carter turns up at arcade tycoon Cliff Brunby's (played by British Soap star Bryan Mosley aka Alf Roberts) house. Brunby gets angry to which Caine reply's "now hang on your a big man, but your out of shape. With me it's a full time job, now behave yourself!"'A pure classic, Caine should be knighted</fullReview>

Also echoes of Clint Eastwood in High Plains Drifter - unflappable, self-assured to the nth degree. Everything fits together beautifully: plot, action, soundtrack, acting and shot-composition (it has a reputation for being a grimy, grey-looking film, but there is a lot of glorious 70's colour in it as well) - what more do you want from a film?

		<fullReview>Jack Carter, a ruthless London gangster, travels to Newcastle to investigate his brother's death. He has his suspicions since it happened under mysterious circumstances. Local crime figures become annoyed with Carter's presence and try to force him out. Too bad that Jack Carter is not one to easily yield.Who would have thought that the likable Michael Caine could play such a brutal bastard? From the minute he walks into the bar in Newcastle to when he is enacting his final vengeance he is a cinematic anti-hero to remember. "Get Carter" is even more appealing on certain levels than Martin Scorsese's legendary gangster films. It doesn't show you too much, but implies a lot. Practically every character has a decent role to play and, the key to the movie, is that it has Carter in virtually every scene. The audience sees the world as he sees it, while Scorsese tends to remove the viewer to a position closer to his own: the director's overall view of what is going on. Both have their merits, but seeing such a cruel world from such a personal point of view is a thrill unto itself.Dark, grim, and realistic with not an ounce of sensationalism this is a gangster film any fan of the crime genre MUST see. --- 9/10Rated R for violence and sex</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Godfather of British gangster movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A truly intriguing movie in many ways and certainly much deeper than one might expect from a film of this genre. Mike Hodges interpretation of Ted Lewis's book, 'Jack's Return Home' is subtle but brilliant in execution.The overall atmosphere of the film, particularly the setting; Newcastle in the early 1970's is suffused with an aura of greyness,decay and corruption, the antithesis of the swinging 60's.Michael Caine's performance in particular is a masterpiece of understated menace combined with an assassin's smile and just enough drop-dead funny lines to lighten the leaden atmosphere. The Racecourse scene in particular with Eric Paice (Ian Hendry) is a classic movie moment! The film was heavily criticised at the time for it's portrayal of violence. This is intriguing because the violence in the film is actually very understated graphically, especially by todays standards. There are no gushes of blood, no scenes of violent torture or villains having their arms ripped out of their sockets! It is the story and the psychology of the main protagonist which makes the violence seem shocking. There are a couple of scenes in the movie which cleverly emphasise this, particularly the consequence of Cliff Brumby's death. You'll have to watch the movie to see what I am referring to! And that, I feel is what makes this film so strong and so influential. There are some fleeting moments in the film where you realise Jack Carter is a human being with real emotions and feelings whose quest to avenge the death of his brother spirals hopelessly out of control. As body count rises towards the end of the story, you realise there can only be one conclusion. Some more enlightened people will recognise this outcome after the first 5 minutes but that wont in anyway diminish what is undoubtedly the Godfather of British gangster movies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Boy Made Bad; a British "Godfather"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The central figure of this film, Jack Carter, is a London gangster who returns to his roots in Newcastle (a large city in the North-East of England, for non-British readers) following the death of his brother Frank. Frank's death has officially been reported as an accident, but Jack suspects that he may have been murdered by members of the local criminal underworld. The film charts Jack's attempts to find out the truth and to take revenge.The film is very much a product of its place and time. The late sixties and early seventies were a time of rapid social change in Britain, marked by increasing social mobility, growing permissiveness and relative prosperity, even in the North which had not yet been affected by the economic crises of the late seventies and eighties and by the decline of its traditional industries. All of these elements are reflected in the film. The period saw a great increase in the number of celebrities who had risen from humble backgrounds; most of these found their fame through wholly lawful activities, but there was also a darker version of this working-class dream. If it was the era of George Best and The Beatles, it was also the era of celebrity criminals such as the Great Train Robbers, Charlie Richardson and the Kray Gang, the real-life counterparts to Jack Carter.The affluence of the period also provided the funds for schemes, not all of them well-directed, for social improvement through changes in the built environment. Among the recurrent images of the film are the traditional terraces of red-brick houses, bare areas of land where similar terraces have been torn down for redevelopment, and the concrete buildings which are being erected as part of new projects. (These shots called to mind my own childhood memories of Lancashire, another working-class region of northern England, from this period). The permissiveness of the era meant that the film could treat violence and sex more graphically than would previously have been allowed by the censor; even ten years earlier such a film would not have been possible. (There was, of course, a limit to seventies permissiveness; the amateur pornography which plays an important part in the plot was still strictly illegal, although from what we see, it seems very soft-core, as well as laughably badly produced, by modern standards).Like many of the best British films, Get Carter has what I would describe as a strong spirit of place, achieved in this case by the use of local dialect and of real-life north-eastern locations, such as the Tyne Bridge or the bleak stretch of coastline where coal waste is dumped into the sea and which forms the backdrop to the film's final scene. The fact that the film reflects a particular location at a particular period in history, however, is not a weakness, as some have suggested; nor does it mean that it is of little interest to a modern audience from outside the English North-East. In my view, fidelity to a real time and place is, in the case of a film of this type, a strength, helping to establish it firmly in the realm of reality.The film has sometimes been compared to another gangster movie from the early seventies, The Godfather. Although the two films are different in terms of style, I think that in terms of quality they are comparable. Whereas Get Carter does not have the epic sweep of the American film, it has, in my view, a greater clarity and cold-eyed honesty. Unlike many films about gangsters, there is no dishonest attempt to portray murderous villains as men of honour or as latter-day Robin Hoods. For all his sharp suits and fast cars, Michael Caine's Carter (one of his best acting performances) is still no more than a ruthless street thug; a poor boy made bad at a time when other poor boys were making good. I have never seen another film which better reveals the sterility and futility of the criminal lifestyle. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Get Carter is often called a "gangster" movie, but even though it is about gangsters it doesn't follow any of the conventions of that genre. It's really more of a Jacobean Revenge Drama set against the backdrop of petty organized crime in Newcastle, England. The film proceeds with all the brutal deliberation of A Clockwork Orange minus the fanciful irony meant in the Burgess-Kubrick picture to suggest an absent (but valid) Judeo-Christian morality. Jack Carter is, indeed, Hamlet, without the hesitation.The film is truly brilliant and pure; it might be hard to watch for those who have grown used to the syrup that Hollywood serves up, but it is hard to think of a movie that more successfully creates a tone and sticks with it. The scene where Carter engages in phone sex in front of his landlady alone is worth the price of admission: outrageous, dark, funny, brilliantly written, and chilling, it reminds you there was a time when the movies were as dangerous and exciting as off-Broadway theatre.Michael Caine defines the anti-hero with his performance. Neither leering nor winking at the audience, he moves through the plot with the cold confidence of a tiger hunting dinner. The cinematography paints Newcastle as a rainy hellhole drained of color and hope. Natives might dispute the portrait but it creates a mileau perfect for the dank events unfolding on the screen.All in all Get Carter is the kind of movie you'd like young directors and writers to study, not because you want them to make more movies this bleak, but because it stands as an example of a complete realization of its material: writing, acting, cinematography and directing all work in unison to create a chilling tale of unstoppable vengeance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty but a difficult watch .......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taking an American perspective on this very British film leads me to several observations. First, Michael Caine is terrific as the ice cold killer, seeking revenge for his brother's death. Second, the grim photography is outstanding. Third, the violence is believable and often quite brutal. Now for the bad news. The British accents are very difficult to understand which detracts. I might even go so far as to suggest using English subtitles. The main flaw however is the characters are numerous, undeveloped, and seem to randomly appear and vanish. It is not easy to follow the somewhat complex story line, which along with the language problem. makes "Get Carter" challenging to watch. - MERK</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suspecting foul play after learning of his brother's death, a ruthless gangster returns home to find those responsible in this iconic British crime drama starring Michael Caine. The film is credited as a 'thriller' on IMDb, but it is a little too leisurely paced for that to ring true. There is very little sense of urgency to Caine's quest to avenge his brother's death - but this is not necessarily a bad thing. If anything, 'Get Carter' is a refreshingly different sort of revenge movie with limited action and a dislikeable main character whose only noticeable human quality is his dedication to his family. There is also an interesting dynamic at hand with Caine acknowledging that he is "the bad one" and that if either of them should be dead by now, it should be him. For all its uniqueness, 'Get Carter' is not, however, the easiest film to watch. There are quite a few dull patches throughout and it is only so interesting to follow a character with relatively few positive qualities. The film additionally throws so many supporting characters into the mix that, upon first viewing at least, it is sometimes hard to keep track of who is who. The scattered memorable moments of the film are, however, very, very memorable. These include an explicit phone sex session with constants cuts to Caine's landlady rocking back and forth in her chair, as well as a scene in which Caine forces two men out of his room at gunpoint and in the nude. The sombre ending is also pitch perfect. Caine and director Mike Hodges would collaborate on the equally uneven and yet still worthwhile 'Pulp' one year later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sleazy 70's gangster classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this recently as it is a well-known British classic thriller. As with a lot of these older films (made in '71) the sound quality wasn't great. That slightly spoiled my enjoyment of the film.If I was to choose a soundtrack that complemented a film perfectly, I would choose the Get Carter theme. The tune opens the film with a solo played on a harpsichord (I think) which evokes a sense of disaffection, and then in the film we arrive by train at a industrial wasteland that is Newcastle in the 1970's. Also a bass guitar is playing a groovy riff in background, and that is after we have witnessed in the film gangsters enjoying a porn film. The music sets up the film perfectly.It has been a while since I watched this film. It certainly reminded me of classic 70s TV programmes like The Sweeney and Play for Today. Gritty, sleazy and with a aftertaste of poverty. Looking back at it though it's quite a straightforward revenge flick. There isn't much character development for Michael Caine as Carter, but he is still good in a quiet, reserved performance.One surprise for me was that the film starred the famous English playwright John Osborne as one of the northern gangsters (Cyril). He is famous for writing plays such as Look Back in Anger. There is northern twist to this film with the backdrop of austerity in Newcastle played against the rich London gangster. Hands full of pound notes and drinking beer out of a straight glass. This brings an added interest to the film. I really thought the setting of the film is one of the most enjoyable parts of it, and alongside the haunting music really captures your interest more than it would in another location.If you want to recapture life in Britain in the 1970's you will love this movie, and it has some of the best British actors in it like Caine and Ian Hendry. The film starts fairly positively for Carter and then descends gradually into hell as he seeks more and more revenge. In the end there is no good guys left including Carter. I gave it a 6/10 because I felt it could have developed the character's back story a bit more, but it is one of those films that stays in your head long after the film ends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the grimmest British films ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GET CARTER is the anti-Hollywood gangster movie, a film which strips away the glitz and glamour one usually associates with the genre to deliver one of the grimmest-looking movies ever. The north eastern locations are wonderfully used with this being a very visual movie that really brings out the grubby dirtiness of an industrial wasteland.The characters, too, are grim. Michael Caine is the epitome of the anti-hero, a man just as cold, violent, and ruthless as those he pursues, except the viewer happens to be tagging along with him on his odyssey of revenge. The film's narrative has a mystery storyline as Caine attempts to uncover the circumstances surrounding his brother's death, and the supporting cast - including a memorable Ian Hendry - is exemplary.Being a film from the 1970s, the sex and violence is ramped up, particularly the former in an arresting phone sex scene with Britt Ekland. Caine is on top form, delivering what I believe to be his most frightening performance, and the script offers up some real corkers in terms of the dialogue. In fact, GET CARTER is a film which it's very difficult to criticise; everything about it gels together perfectly, and it's a real classic for a reason. Mike Hodges should be proud of his accomplishments here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Micro Mini Skirt Neo Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite possibly the ultimate British Neo Noir. Directed by Mike Hodges. The film stars Michael Caine, Ian Hendry, Britt Ekland, John Osborne, Geraldine Moffat, Rosemarie Dunham, Petra Markham, Tony Beckley, George Sewell, and Bryan Mosley. The film was lensed by cinematographer Wolfgang Suschitzky and edited by John Trumper. The screenplay was adapted by Mike Hodges from Ted Lewis' 1969 novel "Jack's Return Home." The film is highly artistic and indulgently stylistic, devoting quite a few segments throughout to these impressive flourishes, which garnish the story elements and makes this film stand quite apart from other British Neo Noirs made up to that point. It's almost on par with what the Spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone did in the mid 1960s for the tired American Western genre and you can not deny this influence in Get Carter, you see it in the cinematography and in various picaresque sequences. Perhaps because its studio, MGM was closing down its European operations, (the film became the last project green- lighted before the American company shuttered its Borehamwood studios), that it has this refreshing freedom to tell it's hard boiled tale the way it's director envisioned, in that magical period of untethered freedom (at least as seen in the American Release) between the Codes, i.e., end of the old Hollywood Hayes Code and the beginning of the corporate media PC code. The film takes place in that "fin de psychedelia" era of the late 60's early 70s. It's the story of London based hood Jack Carter (Michael Caine), a suave, mod-ish character who is cheeky enough to be doing his mobster boss Fletcher's girlfriend Anna (Britt Ekland) on the side. We open with Jack gazing out into an enveloping darkness at the penthouse apartment of mobster Fletcher. We can hear the sound of a desolate wind blowing through a bleak void. He is attending a sort of boys night out slide show of porn stills which flash upon a screen. Fletcher and the boys are bawdily joking around but Jack's mind is on other things. He wants to return home to his native Newcastle upon Tyne in Northern UK to find out why his brother Frank died. He's told by Fletcher (Terence Rigby) not to go, that it will cause trouble with the gangs in charge up North, Jack replies "I'll think about it". Jack decides to go North. Someone with a Noir lovers perspective will love the knowing references to the Film Noirs of the past. The title sequence evokes La b?te humaine (1938), and it's American remake Human Desire (1954), also The Narrow Margin (1952), and Blast Of Silence (1961), Jack is even reading Raymond Chandler's "Farewell My Lovely" during his train journey. Another sequence later in the film again references The Narrow Margin (1952) with an escape through the clotheslines, and there's a nod to Point Blank (1967), there are probably others to discover. Hodges and Wolfgang Suschitzky film Jack entering a pup like a gunfighter would enter a saloon. Heads turn, and if there was a piano player the music would have stopped. They also use what I would call "extreme over the shoulder shots", Where the heads and shoulders of the actors with their backs to you either frame or at times even partially eclipse the face of the actor facing them. Jack soon questions the circumstances of his brother Frank's death. There are two rival gangs, running the town by an uneasy truce, one outfit is run by flesh-peddler, porno king, Cyril Kinnear (John Osbourne). Kinnear lives on a country estate in a posh house, reminiscent of Hugh Hefner's mansion. It seems to have a continuously running house party of birds in micro minis and turtlenecked playboys. The other gang is led by Arcade Emporium Czar, Cliff Brumby (Bryan Mosley). He respectfully resides in a pseudo Tudor with an opulent goldfish pond. Both residences are in stark contrast to the crumbling industrial cityscape of wharves, elevated railway trestles serving waterfront coal docks, gray cobblestone streets flanked by red-gray brick houses, that resemble storm sewers in cross section, that seem to flush the human working class down to the gray waters of a cloaca maxima called the Tyne. All this against an equally gray polluted sky, a dreary world of total decay and decadence. When Jack arrives up in this Wild North, he's back in what he calls the "crap hole". Jack acting like a noir detective, even to the point of wearing a black trench coat, soon shakes things up enough to force one of the gangs to make a move against him. Jack Carter is more vicious, violent, hair triggered, and amoral, than all those set in motion against him. He's your classic alienated and obsessed noir character, ready to explode at any inducement. Through brutal encounters with various underworld denizens both male and female Jack deduces that brother Frank had been working for Kinnear and was set up by Brumby who showed Frank a porno flick starring his own daughter Doreen. Frank was going to go to the police. It's hinted at that Doreen is actually Jacks illegitimate daughter. Jack goes totally Noirsville. The film's stylistic flourishes to note, are the sped up rail journey title sequence cross edited with normal speed in coach shots of Jack on the journey. The cross edited and varying focus phone sex sequence between Jack and Anna with Edna eavesdropping while in the same room with Jack and rocking furiously. Also there is a similar cross cut sequence between Glenda shifting a Sunbeam Alpine sports car and Jack and Glenda having sex all to the throaty roar of the Sunbeam's exhaust. Michael Cain's Jack joins the Pantheon of anti-heroes. I do believe it's his best performance, it's a must view for serious Noir/Neo Noir aficionados.Complimentary soundtrack by Roy Budd.

		<shortDescription>A seedy Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw Get Carter when I was 15 when it was shown on ITV. The film was cut heavily- mainly by the broadcaster- and remember that it was the talk of the school the next morning. Admittedly a lot of the schoolboy discussion centred on the scenes in which Geraldine Moffat and, especially, Britt Ekland bare their breasts but there was enough realisation amongst my friends of nearly 40 years ago that Get Carter was rather a good picture.The film enjoys as high a reputation now as it ever has. Even in the late nineteen nineties when it and the original Ted Lewis novel on which it is based were re-released reviews were mixed. Part of the problem that people had , and I would imagine still have, with Get Carter is that people could not accept Caine as such a despicable figure as Carter proves to be. I had, in early 1976, only ever seen Caine in Zulu and a terrible film with Jane Fonda (Hurry Sundown I think) when I first saw Get Carter all those years ago so had less of a preconceived notion of what Caine should be like so he just seemed like a great 'baddie' who, eventually, gets his comeuppance (but only after the other baddies get what they deserve) but I can see now why at the time people who had loved Caine in the Harry Palmer films or in the Italian Job or as Alfie ( though I think that character is actually a swine)were aghast at this lovable rogue pouring whisky down Ian Hendry's throat prior to smashing his head in or throwing Bryan Mosley off a multi-story car park. And he treats women abominably. The film is criticised because it shows a lot of violence towards women - with other violence being implied- and I can see why people are uncomfortable with that but this is a gangster movie and gangsters are not nice people. I think it is a more legitimate criticism that the female characters are weak/submissive/untrustworthy but even so the most sympathetic character in the film is Carter's niece ( Doreen) and she is the one character who shows a kinder, even sensitive side of Carter.The film is now almost regarded as one of those dreaded 'national treasures' with some of its more famous lines like Ian Hendry's character Eric Paice having eyes like 'two pissholes in the snow' or the architects who remark after Carter throws Brumby off that car park ' I don't think we are going to get our fee' or a bystander in the post office who on being told about the man being thrown from that car park asks 'was he dead?' suggest a bit of jollity that is more in line with the Caine of The Italian Job but it is in truth a gritty, uncomfortable picture that even now seems pretty visceral. Although there is no hint of the supernatural in Get Carter the film made after it which is most like it in some ways is Eastwood's underrated High Plains' Drifter in which Eastwood's character wreaks similar havoc as an outsider arriving in a village that had some grisly secrets it wishes to be kept hiddenGet Carter is very much Caine's picture but John Osborne as the number one villain Kinnear as well as the aforementioned Hendry and Mosley provide great support and I have always liked Moffat as the flaky, lush, sports car driving girlfriend of Kinnear. Alan Armstrong - now a very highly respected actor- makes one of his earliest appearances and is pretty good and for a film set in Newcastle upon Tyne his is one of the few local accents heard. Ekland looks very nice in her black undies though I will admit that this particular scene serves little in the way of dramatic point.The film looks great with some great location shots of a Newcastle that does not seem to exist anymore and the Roy Budd score is superb- the title sequence in which the main theme is played as carter makes his train journey North is a magnificent scene setter in the class of Touch of Evil. I really like Get Carter and think it is one of the Holy Trinity of Brit Gangster films alongside the 1947 Brighton Rock and 1980's The Long Good Friday. It is brutal and the characters almost uniformly amoral but the story is neatly rounded out and the ending surprising but satisfactory. It is rather more than just seeing Britt Ekland in her pants as I and my old school chums once thought it mainly was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You become voyeur and villain in Get Carter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My original interpretation of the cinematographer/director's style was that it was placing the camera in the position of someone spying on the scene. I think the word "spy" though is wrong. It is the position of a voyeur. The rough, hand-held style relied on a "foreground obstruction" aesthetic, too -- the motion of the camera and the intervening objects/people divided our attention between the story as an objective thing, and made me at least feel as though we are seeing found footage from a documentary that is asking us to form an opinion from a mass of distracting elements.Later, the obstructions, distractions, and extras change from being incidental to the story to becoming central to the story.I got the sense right away that Jack Carter had come home to figure out what happened to his brother. He clearly didn't buy the drunk driving accident myth. And yet Jack shaving over his brother's coffin (showing no respect) and then his covering his brother's face (showing respect) communicates ambiguity about Jack's character. Is he an anti-hero taking on a moral vendetta, standing in for any of us who have seen or been victim to injustice? Or is he something else? The sex started out as fun, and the women were beautiful. The way it was shot (the rocking chair scene, for example) used women in the foreground (or, Britt's legs in the foreground) to bring them forward in our awareness without them being the main plane of focus (either Jack on the phone or Britt's beautiful and erotic face). The rocking chair evoked the sounds and rhythms of sex but was absurdly quirky - a real point of humor, I think, but the beginning of how the director starts to blend sex, violence and humor. We also see at the end of the rocking horse scene that the phone sex was not with Jack's monogamous partner, but that he was deeply in the erotic imagination of a woman attached to another man, and he was forcefully and unapologetically going to exploit his position there. Even though what we learn about Jack in the rocking chair scene by itself happens to thousands or millions of people, in the context of the shaving scene and his penchant for paying people to do his bidding (at their risk) or to non-apologize apologize, we begin to see him as emotionally ill or detached. Not just an anti-hero.Also early in the movie when there is a sex scene, before the audience gets a chance to let their heart slow down, bad guys show up to menace Jack - with the timing of the arrival of bad guys quickly converging precisely on the moment of intercourse. Jack confidently wields a large gun and forces bad guys onto the street, following after them with no compunction, is funny ... but at the same time showing something menacing about Jack. A lack of shame becomes somehow foreshadowing for a deep lack of morality or empathy.So now we get to the question: Is he a psychopath? The cruel language he uses with women, his roughness with them, particularly in the beginning, could perhaps at the time be understood as a grieving brother amidst prostitutes who were hiding information about his brother's death. But from 2015 -- and from the perspective of what we learn about Jack by the end of the movie -- he was a misogynist. Indeed, the disturbing scene where he gives his ex-brother's lover/regular prostitute an overdose shows him as calculating and without any empathy.It's interesting to me that the core moment when Jack learns the motivation for everyone's bad before -- seeing Doreen in a porn film -- he goes from enjoying the film to being devastated. This is precisely what I was going through. I loved the beautiful women in the film and was willing to suspend my critique of their characters for some cinematic pleasure. But as the characters were having sex, the director was presenting them to us as a voyeur. The director's style was voyeuristic, and he had successfully made me a voyeur as well. That transition of the viewer's role is disturbing. And Jack goes from that moment of "harmless" and pleasurable porn viewing and fantasy to a realization of the depth of exploitation involved.The ending is covered in filth, waste, inhumanity. When Jack finally kills the man responsible for his brother's death, his grim, angry face doesn't just laugh, it cackles. Has he cracked? The article I linked to above makes that case, but I don't think so. That would imply he has, at that point, lost his moral code. I think he never had one. So the laugh, in my view, is instead a proof point: He is a psychopath. And so, when he ultimately is shot in the head and lies in the filthy tide, I was shocked, but not, in the least, sad. After the police show up at the mansion and pull all the partiers outside, the director presents them to us -- almost as a line-up. (He is cutting between this and other scenes). These people, formerly drugged-up, naked, and otherwise debauched, looked like a cross-section of English society. After a movie of being a voyeur looking at the dangerous world of gangster violence and sex, we now find ourselves looking at ... ourselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>needs a simpler plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>London gangster Jack Carter (Michael Caine) goes to Newcastle for his brother's funeral and investigate his death. He suspects foul-play and dives into the Newcastle underworld. His brother leaves behind his daughter Doreen Carter and mistress Margaret. He tracks down crime boss Cyril Kinnear where he also meets Glenda. Meanwhile his boss Fletchers back in London sends henchmen to Newcastle to Get Carter back. He's having an affair with his other boss Gerald's girlfriend Anna. He is given businessman Brumby's name but Cliff Brumby points the finger at Kinnear. He finds a porno where Doreen is pushed into joining.There are just so many characters coming in and out of the story. It's a bit confusing and muddies up the tension. Many movies of that era don't always keep things clear. Michael Caine is terrific and super cool. The violence is sudden and brutal. A simpler plot would have allowed the audience to concentrate on the film's strength which is Caine and his vicious character. I can certainly see why this is a cult classic for many gangster movie enthusiasts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A portrait of revenge--and all that it entails</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am somewhat mystified by the reputation of Get Carter as a cult classic. To me, this is a portrait of revenge and the self-destructive effect that it has upon the perpetrator, who basically transmogrifies into his enemy by deigning to conduct himself as he did--and worse. In this case, the angry Carter seeks to avenge his brother's murder, but ends up whacking everyone and his sister, girlfriend, and other random associates along the way. Pretty unsettling and more a statement of the killer's deranged mental state than anything else. Near the end, he was even starting to resemble Henry Lee Lucas a bit."He who lives by the gun dies by the gun" is essentially the moral of this story. Or, if you like: "What goes around comes around," or perhaps "violence breeds violence." There was nothing noble whatsoever in this killing spree. I do aver that Michael Caine did a pretty good job in the role of someone suffering from serious, big-time OCD with a major ide fixe expressed only in the medium of yet more homicide. Too bad he wasn't a poet instead.</fullReview>

As the story unfolds we, as the viewer, are lead through a corrupt world of cowards and frauds that are all looking to prolong their gamble at a life led drunk. Its plain to see that Carter, from the get-go, has no fears and accepts his fate but will take all the bastards that did him and his family wrong down with him. This film has no apologies and no regrets.Whoever's bright idea it was to remake it staring "Sly Stallone" (no offense Sly, you're one of the greats) has done a deep injustice to cinema that the original back-hands with all the daring camera work and jarring edits. A technical classic that doesn't exist in contemporary film. The chase scenes on foot and the deep fear that each of the victims feels as they are hunted by Carter kept me, for certain, locked in. Rarely do I re-watch a film and feel so gripped, this film holds time for me and I look forward to watching it again in the future.Just watch your back next time at the beach ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is a realistic look at the seedy side of England in the early 70s.It shows how run down and grey things appeared to be back then with dingy houses and bleak landscapes providing the backdrop for the unpleasant characters which this film is full of.I think this is Michael Caine's finest performance. He plays the ruthless, unpleasant and thoroughly nasty gangster Jack Carter who goes back to Newcastle to find out what really happened when his brother died apparently while drink driving.Carter eventually discovers that his brother was murdered because his daughter had been abused in a sordid sex film and he was going to go to the police. Jack Carter then sets about taking his revenge on the people involved. He shows no mercy and murders a number of them callously including throwing one off a multi storey car park which is being converted into a club. The fact that innocent passers by also get injured/killed when the body falls on their car doesn't bother him at all.Caine plays Carter very well. He is totally without scruples and is a cold, calculating killer who uses people anyway he wants just to get his way.Carter is a total anti hero. The majority of the other characters involved are just as nasty. However, the way Carter uses everyone makes feeling any sympathy towards him impossible. Some people who help Carter are treated just as badly by him. He is utterly without morals.In the end it appears that Carter has succeeded because everyone connected with his brothers death has either been murdered or is likely to spend time in prison. The way he chases, kills and then disposes of the body of Ian Hendry's character is particularly nasty.The twist at the end is that Carter is killed by an assassin hired by the boss of the gangster gang (well played by John Osborne) who Carter had double crossed by informing the police about his involvement in the sex film and other activities.This is a tough, gritty and realistic look at the grim, unpleasant underworld. None of the main characters are very nice and the run down, dingy Newcastle of the early 70s makes it appear even more melancholy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grittiness made amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this British gangster movie a London gangster played by Michael Caine goes to Newcastle to investigate the death of his brother. In his quest for vengeance he takes out a large portion of the Newcastle gangster community. Get Carter which is in my opinion one of the best British movies ever made, is not for everyone. It's a nasty, disturbing and haunting experience filled with violence, grit and moral ugliness. However, it is vital viewing for anyone who is a fan of British cinema. It may be a brutal, cold blooded affair but it doesn't condone or glorify the violence. It remains objective throughout, and is likely a thematic study of the both working class in the 70s and the British criminal underworld. It feels chillingly realistic throughout and there's no stupidity, dumb CGI or OTT car chases here. There is action but it's done with skill, tension and utterly hypnotic direction. Michael Caine gives a towering, blazing and haunting performance as Jack Carter and creates one of the best antiheroes in movie history.Get Carter is a very gritty movie, but unlike modern day action movies it doesn't drown itself in grit and remains a compelling, at times slightly harrowing study of crime. The portrayal of the criminal underworld and Newcastle is captivating and despite the nastiness of the movie it's impossible to look away. It's not the easiest watch out there, but Get Carter is also blackly humorous and thrilling. It's got a brilliant, hauntingly powerful script with developed characters and subtle yet haunting themes. This is an unforgettable movie that's every bit as good as all the American revenge thrillers Hollywood has done. It's a far more compelling and haunting movie than most, and ultimately hits like a bullet between the eyes. Overall, what makes Get Carter so absurdly effective is the awe inspiring Michael Caine acting masterclass at the centre, the realistic, chilling and gritty direction and the haunting atmosphere of it. It is a tough film and with its haunting portrayal of Newcastle you'll never look at Geordie Shore the same way again, but Get Carter is a showcase of the brilliance of British cinema.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Caine is in fine form in this well plotted crime picture, a solid mixture of action and melodrama. He plays Jack Carter, a small time London gangster who travels to the town of Newcastle to investigate the death of his brother Frank. Unfortunately, people just won't play it straight with him during the course of his enquiries. But Jack is a very tenacious guy. Cold blooded and ruthless, he is very much a man on a mission.Adapted by director Mike Hodges from the novel "Jack's Return Home" by Ted Lewis, this is deliberately paced, but the cast is simply superb and Hodges does an expert job at depicting the seamy British underworld. Among the suspects is a slimy pornographer, Cyril Kinnear (John Osborne); other lowlifes are portrayed by Ian Hendry and Bryan Mosley. Roy Budds' music score is most effective at enhancing the action. The ladies present are tantalizingly sexy: Britt Ekland as Anna, Geraldine Moffat as Glenda, and Petra Markham as Jacks' niece Doreen.Caine has one of his best ever roles and is compelling to watch as he dispenses his brand of justice. You know that no matter what, he's going to get his answers and punish the guilty, and that it's going to be good fun to see him pursue all leads. The plot culminates in a rather amusing spin on climactic chase scenes, and this action is staged in a fairly unusual setting. And things are resolved in a way that may come as something of a shock to the viewer.41 years later, this continues to work very well as a "modern noir" kind of tale.The novel was filmed again just one year later as the blaxploitation feature "Hit Man" and filmed once more under the "Get Carter" title in 2000.Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best revenge movies made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If not the best. Michael Caine as the ruthless gangster was menacing. There was something distant and cold about the way he portrayed him. That makes for a strong on-screen presence. The best thing about Caine was that he did not overdo his portrayal of Jack Carter. His portrayal of him was pretty down-to-earth. This movie shows how wide ranging Michael Caine's acting skills are. His portrayal of Carter made the character an intimidating and unlikeable character that was basically just a bastard. A bastard out to avenge the death of his brother. The character was ruthless and used every dirty trick to get what he was after. So a bastard out to avenge another bastard. That makes for a deliciously politically incorrect movie with basically no characters to root for. That makes this movie awesome if you ask me. It makes for a much more thought provoking movie experience and not just a movie which spends energy on ingratiating its audience. In my opinion there are too many politically correct movies, but that is what most people watches so it makes me like this movie that much more.Mike Hodges did such a good job for a directorial debut. He gave the movie a good pace that was not too slow or too fast. The plot and the story unfolds smoothly. The plot is quite simple, but that is what makes the movie so brilliant. I feel that makes the movie unpretentious, if the clichs from other revenge Flicks had made its way into this movie then it would have made the movie pretentious. Pretentious clichs like the avenger is a good guy and is a righteous character who always do the right thing. Here the main character, like previously written, is a bastard. A man who is no better than the people he is after to kill. Which makes the movie more convincing in my opinion, since it does not present us with an idealized man. Many movies have idealized men, which often lead to the movie have a loose approach on moral. This movie took moral seriously, look at the main character. He wasn't any better than the men he killed and what happened to him at the end showed revenge is bad. No matter what cause it may be. So the movie's message is its moral, revenge can not be justified.The movie's approach was down-to-earth much the same way Caine did with his character, which makes the impact at the ending of the movie so much more stronger. It is a very good revenge movie with a decent and convincing plot and story. Which makes it quite awesome. Especially the ending left me quite in awe, not because of shock though. Deifinitely one of the best revenge movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting revenge thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today Michael Caine is considered to be not only one of Hollywood's most beloved actors, but also a symbol for all of the United Kingdom. Over the years Michael Caine has moved from a relatively unknown British actor to a household name. It's hard to say what it truly is about him that people like so much. Is it his accent? Is it the characters' he plays? Or is it his presence alone that defines him? Well whatever it is, it's difficult not to enjoy whatever movie Michael Caine stars in. Even for this movie, it's challenging to have the bad counter the good here.In this crime thriller, Michael Caine plays a real life British gangster named Jack Carter. Upon coming home one day he learns that his brother has died. Believing that it wasn't an accident, Carter sets out to seek the truth and personal justice. What Jack doesn't realize, is that how much he doesn't know about what he's looking for. This is the kind of plot where the main character digs for the truth without realizing how much they'll actually get. It's a gamble most characters aren't ready for - yet the character of Jack Carter is. Jack Carter will get what he wants, even if it means he has to kill. What also distinguishes Jack Carter from many other anti-heroes is the fact that he's not a clean person either. He has just as much problems as any other gangster does. Yet the audience will feel more sympathetic for him because of the story telling thanks to writer/director Mike Hodges.There are other well-known British actors in this movie as well, but it depends on how familiar the viewer is with other foreign cast members. For example, Britt Ekland who plays Anna, would also play in The Wicker Man (1973) and The Man With the Golden Gun (1974). Ian Hendry also has an interesting role to play here too, watch him carefully. One of the more tasteful aspects of this movie are the scenes where Carter is figuring out who are his enemies and who are his allies. Once it is determined to the audience, the act of revenge feels so much more gratifying. The kill scenes however aren't too unique. There are perhaps a few scenes that people may not expect but other than that, it's nothing out of the ordinary.However, there are also a couple of scenes where it feels like the plot doesn't go anywhere. This rarely happens but in most movies this well constructed, it shouldn't happen at all. Cinematography wise, the background looks great. Wolfgang Suschitzky did a nice job capturing a lot of England without having to use matine paintings or other special effects. The last thing to be mentioned was the music provided by Roy Budd. Budd's music is almost entirely absent throughout the running time yet he proves to the audience that he knows what he's doing. It's disappointing too because the opening theme for Carter is so catchy and memorable. Why wouldn't you want to continue that? Overall, a good revenge flick.Without Michael Caine starring, who knows if this film would have the following that it has today. The story is well developed and has an intriguing message about what finding the truth to something leads to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man, you do not want to cross Michael Caine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Carter is pisser of a character, and Caine plays him with such a menacing calm. When he's not busting heads, that is. It's not just that he's as hard-nosed as it gets, but her's a prick to just about everyone he meets. "Get Carter" is one hell of a down-n-dirty revenge movie; violent, lascivious and infused with all manner of grit, from its gutter characters to its seedy locations. It completely turned for me when Carter saw the porno, and I've gotta admit it's a thrill to see this hard bastard grow livid. Granted, there's no good to come from this sordid tale, especially when the good guy is a rib-cracking gangster. But it really is something to see Caine being the one to dole out the pain. And that's one ending I did not see coming.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkably grim revenge story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Hodges caught my eye with his fatalistic I'll Sleep When I'm Dead, in which the protagonist's vengeance was doled out with such sad, resigned futility and the gray sky seemed to engulf the characters, judging their abject dealings. A similar air of determinism permeates his first feature, a remarkably grim revenge story whose avenger might be the most corrupt figure in the film. Michael Caine is Jack Carter, the smooth antihero who can only communicate through money, sex, or violence, utterly incapable of real human empathy. Resembling James Bond in his lothario qualities?and the way women seem to suffer most at his hand?and a transplanted Philip Marlowe in his affected, aloof manner of speech and action, Carter ventures up north to London to bury his brother and maybe to see if any foul play was involved. Of course there was, in the form of a local crime syndicate that traffics in drugs and sex. The revelatory scene where Carter puts the pieces together is a brilliant piece of acting, direction and editing, as Caine begins the scene as casual observer and gradually registers increments of grief, guilt and anger while the camera proportionately cuts back to the shocking evidence at which he's aghast. One might say that his subsequent path of rampage is an agonized attempt to exorcise his guilt?at not being there, at being so slow to uncover the motive, at being a voyeur to the crime?and as such there's no valor in his vengeance, only a meaningless quest to mollify his soul. Hodges' refusal to beautify Carter's violence lends the picture an unusual complexity, a kind of implicit mourning for the world's perpetual cycle of violence that benefits no one. (When Carter dumps a key player over a parking-garage wall, Hodges lingers over the car he fell on as paramedics remove the vehicle's likely deceased innocent bystanders.) Jack might think he's gained some hard-earned wares on that beach with his vanquished enemy, but his self-satisfied smile is quickly and permanently removed. This is another extraordinary, unsparing movie from Mike Hodges.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the Very Few British Films of its Time that could Match Hollywood as Movies were Becoming more Realistic, Raw, Natural, Gritty, and Gloomy. In what was a Tell it Like it Is Era when Censorship no longer Mattered and the Motto was "Let it all hang out."Here, the Folks Across the Pond Served up a Cold Dish of Revenge, all Dark and Grey, Rainy and Ruins, Side Streets and Garbage Dumps. Making His way Around in the Squalor of these Locations filled with so many Human Rats is Gangster Carter, Coming Home to find Why and Who Murdered His Brother.He Uncovers that and a lot more as Things Unfold and Carter Takes Out the Trash. It is all Bleak and Nasty with some Pithy Dialog and the Movie has Echoes of Raymond Chandler and some of the Uneducated Macho Detachment of Mike Hammer.Overall it is a Template of its Time and it Wears it all Proudly and Without Care. Considered one of Michael Caine's Best Roles and one of the Best British Films. Not for all Tastes but Cannot be Ignored for it was Influential and to this Day has a Huge Fan Base, Anchored in Britain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Get Carter" is a very nasty film. The language is rough, there's a lot of nudity and there are lots of naked folks. It is NOT a good film to watch with your kids, mother-in-law or Father Jenkins! However, if you don't mind all the sleazy nastiness, it IS awfully entertaining.The film begins in London. Carter (Michael Caine) is being advised by his mobster friends to stay away from his brother's funeral in Newcastle. However, Carter is determined to go--and determined to learn how his brother died and who is responsible. For the rest of the movie, Carter mucks about Newcastle--hanging about low-lifes and kicking butt. Carter is violent, remorseless and unstoppable in his quest. At first, you have no empathy for the man--after all, he is a brutal mobster. However, when you learn exactly why the brother was killed, you begin to root for Carter. See the film and you'll see what I mean.This is a very stylish and well made film. Not a lot of plot, but highly entertaining and Caine does a dandy job. Well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get Michael Caine If You Want A Fine Actor!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Caine stars (in a brilliant performance) as Jack Carter, a tough &amp; ruthless gangster from London who travels to Newcastle to investigate his brothers death, and uncovers the fact that he was murdered, so systematically sets out to avenge him by killing everyone responsible, no matter who, or how powerful, which ultimately puts him at odds against his own gang...Director Mike Hodges creates a unique atmosphere of menace, well capturing its time and place, making this a true time capsule of a film. But it is Michael Caine who makes this(at times) unsavory film work so well, since he is a true "anti-hero" if there ever was one, though of course the reason behind the title becomes obvious by the hard-hitting ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece of plot, character and location. *personal TOP 10*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can this only have 163 reviews!? This has been a classic of the British film industry since 1971. There is the answer, though: British film. As such, there is much about it that Hollywood-dependent viewers might not get, such as the location and the web of earthy English characters, and the particular flavour of the English underworld. Also, there aren't many big bangs or car chases or much loud music. It doesn't need them. Here's why: it has a PLOT, tension, wonderfully empathetic (if not exactly 'sympathetic') characters, terrific dialogue, and an absolutely captivating but kind of depressing and grubby tour of Newcastle, UK, in the 70s. Get Carter is indeed a product of its time, yet is NOT dated, and probably never will be.In essence, it is a revenge movie, no different in its central hook than 'Mad Max' or 'The Punisher' - movies which might seem light years apart. Hero - or 'anti-hero', we should say - has lost family member to murder, and cuts a swathe of detective work and vengeance through the network of depravity and evil responsible for it. The difference here, though, is the subtlety and grounded realism with which the plot unfolds, and the social and scene-setting aided by superb editing and camera-work. Examples range from little glimpses of people hanging out the top window of their grubby little terraced houses, to snapshots of the grimy industrial landscape, and the cold and murky north sea lapping at a wasted shoreline even as the climactic chase is taking place (this is what we get instead of inane music and screeching tyres, you see - simply brilliant!). The movie reaches a superior strata as a dire commentary on the pathetic and useless hedonism of this criminal class's lifestyle. Everybody from the Mr Bigs down to the muscle-men, the pawns and prostitute hangers-on appear to get what's coming, and yet none of them can seem to see it until it's too late. It's almost all seen through the eye of Carter, quite simply a very dangerous man (which one or two vain and vacuous whores fail to realize to their cost), not at all the 'good guy' as such. Hell, in one instance it looks like he has taken out an innocent schoolgirl via 'friendly fire', as it were (in this case tossing his victim off a tall building and the body smashing into the windscreen of a passing car - and Carter doesn't even know it, much less care). Yet we are thoroughly gripped by him throughout, undoubtedly in large part due to the one-and-only Michael Caine in the role. Even without him it would have been an excellent movie, but he helps to make it legendary.The Hollywood remake... with Sylvester Stallone? F... that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grit, power, Caine: three elements of an awesome film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never has there been such a justification for the belief that Hollywood remakes are pointless and pathetic. The original Get Carter is a masterful film that set the untouchable benchmark for British gangster films, helped in no small part by the terrific performance given by Sir Michael Caine.The film, based on the novel 'Jack's Return Home', is about Newcastle-born London gangster Jack Carter and his mission to seek revenge on the people who murdered his brother Frank. He goes to Newcastle (a 'craphouse' as Jack puts it) where he confronts many memorable characters such as Margaret, Eric and Cliff Brumby, who all meet chilling ends at the hands of Carter, who himself is given a fitting death that leaves the viewer satisfied, but also sympathetic towards Jack.The acting and location work of the film in particular is superb. Caine gives a sadistically cold and ruthless performance with hints of true emotion that dwarfs Sylvester Stallone in the remake. Special marks also go to Petra Markham as Jack's sexually abused niece and Britt Ekland as the girlfriend of Jack's employer, who partakes in an unforgettable phone sex scene with Carter.Overall, I can say only this. Do not watch the remake. It makes Jack less of a killer and more of a good guy, and the whole film itself seems like a breezy, stylish action flick. This should not be allowed. Instead, watch the original to get the full effect of how a gangster film should be and remember: 'get Carter before Carter gets you'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best British film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget the awful American remake, only the 1971 British original will do. I don't think there is anyone in Britain who hasn't seen Get Carter at least once and even fewer who have a bad word said against what is the coolest and best made British film ever. Also it was the first major British film to be made in the North East.However, I think I would be insulting your intelligence if I gave details of the plot and mentioned a quote about a big man, so I won't. What really makes it for me are the locations and the theme tune by Roy Budd. Newcastle in 1971 was a grimy industrial city going into a long economic decline, so it was only right that Get Carter reflected the grimness of the environment where his brother was killed. (Newcastle then was a far cry from the party city with a touristy waterfront people now know). Locations such as the rundown terraces where Carter's brother lived, the seedy Las Vegas guest house which would probably get minus five stars if the AA visited it and industrial locations such as Hebburn and Seaham colliery add to the film's appeal to me, being born in this part of the country. Ironically the run down street used for the location of the Las Vegas is still standing, but most of the other locations, including the sixties flats where Glenda lived, have long since gone.As a reminder of what Newcastle was like 40 years ago, Get Carter is hard to beat. Certainly no waterfront bars, fancy nightclubs, sushi restaurants or apartment blocks inhabited by rich footballers in Jack Carter's Newcastle, in one scene the nightlife is a middle aged pub singer who gets into a fight with a woman to the amusement of the regulars. Also viewers who are aware of the congestion in modern day Newcastle will find the traffic free streets refreshing and those of us of a certain age always like to hear mention of pounds, shillings and pence.Even if you have seen Get Carter about a million times like me, this is one film you will never tire of watching as the acting and the locations are so good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Michael Caine Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I truly believe that 1971's Get Carter is one of the best British films ever made. It is a simple revenge flick, but it is much more than all the 'guns and geezers' trash that has tainted our national cinema. The film has massive amounts of charm and although Caine's character is performing lawless acts of violence, you Sympathise with his cause. The pain and the anger he feels inside makes you feel sorry for him and you understand that he is dealing with the situation in the only way he knows how. Michael Caine gives a stunning performance as one of his most famous characters, Jack Carter, and Mike Hodges direction is well paced and perfect for this film. The setting of Newcastle brings something fresh to the viewer after being soaked with east end cockney gangsters for so many years. Yes, Jack Carter is a Londoner, but thats just where he comes from not who he is. I highly recommend that you watch this film (but for your sake, I would try to avoid the Sylvester Stallone remake). It is a brilliant piece of cinema and will be one of the defining moments in Michael Caine's long and extensive career. SG</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT! An almost unrelentingly brutal movie with revenge crazed Michael Caine out to find out who killed his brother. Caine, a callous gangster, takes on pornographer John Osborne and his sleazy goons until he gets some answers. Caine has never been so nasty and director Mike Hodges injects a lot of clever touches (there's a lot more going on than you'd think...the title is perfect). Playwright Osborne is reptilian (calm &amp; deadly) and Ian Hendry, as his ruthless right hand man, is excellent. The movie takes on an almost hypnotic quality as you get wrapped up in Caine's pursuit. There's a great music score by Roy Budd and some really dank locations (the film is set in Newcastle). Though he's directed some twenty movies since, Hodges has never made anything quite as good. It's cleverly cast and exceptionally acted. There's a brief (and decidedly kinky) cameo by Britt Ekland.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Caine as Jack Carter remains one of the best of the two films of the same name titled Get Carter yet its hard to believe that he had appeared in an utterly pointless Sylvester Stallone remake by stepping into the late Bryan Molsley's shoes as some oddball called Mr Brumby. In fact, to most film buffs, the original Get Carter movie is an absolute "down memory lane" classic being filmed in a bleak outpost of North East England centred around the industrial city of Newcastle-on-Tyne and the film settings are excellent and even so, it is hard to imagine what it was like back in the early 1970s with most of it now long gone along with the industries that served us such as coal, steel and shipbuilding. The film also reflects on what living standards were like in that era when the mini-skirts worn by younger women were still in fashion and most of the exteriors of the older houses were usually grey with cream-painted window frames and it was typical around that time. In some cases, this film is quite funny and you have been warned, its quite violent and nasty that it doesn't deserve to have a bad ending with Michael Caine's gangster character being regarded as a fallen hero.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Getting real</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Mike Hodges' celebrated film 'Get Carter', Michael Caine plays a 1970s gangster searching for revenge for his dead brother against a backdrop of iconic Tyneside locations. Not that this is a glamorous movie; for all the famous scenery, this is a very ugly Newscastle, with most of the action taking place in boarding houses and slums, building sites and toilets (with as many as three key scenes featuring the latter!). The final scene of all takes place beneath a cable car designed to dump coal spoil into the sea; the world depicted seems a lifetime away from our own. But how does the film hold up after nearly 40 years? The answer is surprisingly well. Some of the dialogue is wooden, and the action sequences flat (at least by modern standards), but this only re-enforces the film's refusal to indulge its protagonists with any sheen of false attractiveness; and Caine does a lot of good acting with his face. Director Hodges seems actively involved in every scene, with persistently interesting composition of shots; and at heart, it's a straightforward (though never gratuitously crowd-pleasing) thriller that as it progresses, fosters an increasing sense of disassociation between the feelings of the audience and the actions of its hero. Though it may now be feted as a quintessential "lads movie", it's actually far more intelligent than that; and well worth watching, even after four decades.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as it gets UK gangster thriller...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My dad's always going on about this epochal British crime-thriller and so knowing that I would later be happily discussing it with him at length, I took the opportunity to watch it on a recent UK TV re-run. The old man had a point... As forceful and direct as its great title, and introduced with one of the best film theme instrumentals you'll hear, we're led straight away into London gangster made-man Caine's avenging (black) angel vendetta against the provincial hoodlums in his native Newcastle who have murdered his brother and tried to cover it up. One of the highest-profile mainstream X-Rated films of its day in the UK, its explicit sexual and violence scenes still cut close to the bone today and yet never distract from the narrative as Caine's Jack Carter ensures there's a hot time in the old town tonight, as the old song has it. Caine is great in the title role, bulked up in his black raincoat, toting, (but never shooting) the rifle which forms the iconic movie-poster, oozing menace and magnetism in equal proportion, this mix serving to intimidate his pursuers and charm the various women he has on a string in the movie. Of the support, I felt Ian Hendry as his nemesis could perhaps have been showcased to be a bigger villain than the cowardly reprobate who Carter finally collars. John Osborne, the famous "Look Back In Anger" playwright no less, is better as the sleazy, never-bettered Mr Big who gets his own revenge right at the death for Carter's tipping off the police to bust him at his mansion. The acting by the women in the cast is equally sharp and sensitive by turns, although everyone will forever remember most Britt Ekland's brief phone-sex scene with Caine in front of his sex-starved land-lady (guess where she ends up soon afterwards?!). The remainder of the all-British cast offer solid support down to the smallest part. The violence is realistic and pulls no punches; you feel the knife driving into Glynn Edward's white-jerseyed stomach and wince at Caine's casual throwing off of Brumby from the car park roof onto a parked car below. The settings are great, cheap bed and breakfasts, sleazy bars, ugly car parks and of course the final scenes played out at the quarry by the beach. Was it right that Caine was killed off in the last reel, thus fulfilling the film's title? For me it works, not only the surprise element itself but also on the premise of "just desserts". Live by the gun, die by the gun. As un-Hollywood a movie as you could possibly get and all the better for it, even as I appreciate it obviously adds to your appreciation if you're UK born and can relate to the source material and backgrounds first hand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're Jack Carter why bother to stop at two?Kill them all and let God sort them out my son.Cockney gunman Michael Caine travels north of Watford ostensibly to avenge his brother's death,but his real motives become a bit muddied as he embarks on a spree of GBH and murder that ends,predictably enough,with his own death.On this rather slight hook the producers have hung a tight,well - paced thriller.It is like a "Brighton Rock" for the 1970s,a "Newcastle Rock",if you like,exploring that city's life at the place where the working class meet the criminal class to the point that the boundaries become blurred.As a sop to the times,instead of Pinkie,a razor - wielding thug we have Jack,a shotgun - wielding thug.He signally lacks Pinkie's overtones of Catholic Guilt or indeed any sort of guilt however,being a man keen on concentrating on the job at hand at the expense of anything else.Focused is the word for our Jack. Made in the then - fashionable "Grimy ooop North" style,"Get Carter" is a cold - eyed look at a group of very unpleasant people who,without wishing to subscribe to any stereotyping or blame culture I can only refer to as criminals.Not Hollywood criminals,not Ealing criminals,not even post - modern - ironic criminals,but vicious,ruthless amoral criminals ,sociopathic in their lack of concern for the consequences of their actions. The source was "Jack's return Home" - a much better title incidentally in my opinion - a short novel by the ill - fated Ted Lewis who died of alcoholism before he was 50.Along with "Gumshoe"(filmed with Albert Finney)it started the revival of British Pulp fiction that has continued apace ever since. Jack Carter has been quoted almost as much as his contemporary Frank Spencer in the intervening years,success does indeed make strange bedfellows. It is not a masterpiece of the British Cinema,it's not even the best British Gangster movie (try the aforementioned "Brighton Rock"),but it is taut ,exciting and entertaining if over the top violence between non - consenting nasty adults is your thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Get Carter is simply one of the best gangster films of all time. Just simply for the acting alone. If the acting was all they had to go on the movie would still be the classic it is today. But The story and the hidden levels to it add to the movie . This doubles up the surprises and the realism. Jack Carter is the mean as hell cold hearted villain or in this case anti-hero trying to find out the ways and whereabouts of his brother's death. It's a tangled web of lies deception hate and greed that await Jack and the ironic part is this he's no better then any of them But for Jack it's personal and that makes a difference. Of course Jack is warned off at the beginning for asking questions that no one want's answered. And Once Jack smells blood he goes after it with a shotgun and no fear. The Difference between this GET CARTER and The Remake GET CARTER 2000 is that Caine's Carter has no redeeming qualities while they tried too hard to make Stallone's Carter a lot more human and likable. Jack Carter isn't likable he's a killing machine sent on a personal mission despite what his mob bosses say Carter Crosses them one time too many and he is left on his own with no protection and no friends. The ending is quite simply the most realistic end to a gangster flick and the saddest ending to a gangster flick that I have ever seen. Despite Carter's Reign of terror blood and death by the end of the film you just can't help but like Carter or at least admire him a little because he is a man who stands by his principles and he doesn't let anyone scare him away from them. Michael Caine should be proud he created one of his best and most memorable anti-hero and mike Hodges must be proud he single handedly created what must be the greatest gangster film in history better then anything Coppola could do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Get Carter sees Michael Caine returning to the North East to avenge the apparent accidental death of his brother. Whilst not receiving the acclaim it deserved following it's release in 1971, the film is now a classic, a dark look at life inside the criminal underworld of the North East. The film is dark and gritty. The scenes of Tyneside are unpolished and the cinematography allows us to feel the coldness of each location. Caine is at his best playing brutal racketeer Carter and he delivers his rough justice without soul or emotion.Critics of this film may try to compare it against Quentin Tarantino's modern works, but this is far better. There is violence and the killings are cold and premeditated, but it is acted and directed with skill leading the viewer to believe that retribution was justified.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carter Got His Gun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When his brother dies under the suspicious circumstances, tough and ruthless London gangster, Jack Carter (Michael Caine) goes to Newcastle to investigate his death. He finds a web of lies, silence, deceit, and danger from the local criminal world. By searching for truth and justice, Carter puts his own life in jeopardy since he becomes dangerous and unwanted intruder who may uncover some dirty secrets that better stay uncovered. Michael Caine plays a cold, unlikable character, a killer who does have one weakness - love for his estranged brother and niece but has difficulties to express his feelings other than through violence. Yes, Jack Carter is unsympathetic character but the people he deals with are so much more despicable that we can't help but root for Carter and wish him to get every one of his enemies. Director Mike Hodges and Michael Caine are best friends and maybe that's why Caine's work in the movie is one of his finest. Bleak and disturbing, tight and gripping, "Get Carter" has achieved a cult status and became a classic of the British Action / Crime / Drama / Thriller genre. It has influenced the directors as different as Guy Ritchie and Neil Jordan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Almost Flawless Anti-Hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie, after hearing great things about it, I was deeply disappointed in it. I thought it dull and long-winded (I know, like my writing--hah, hah, hah!). I sat down last night to watch it again, after having it collect dust in my video cabinet for three years; I was going to give it away to the local library, but I figured, give it one more chance.What a strange transformation of my opinion of this movie. I really was bummed about Get Carter. I thought it was simply so dark and repulsive, so slow and dry that the people who raved about it were just hopelessly in love with crummy movies (I have my own "sinful pleasures," but mine are at least entertaining; "McQ" comes to mind).Maybe it's the fact that I've seen the Stallone remake (not bad, but the best part was Sly's wardrobe) and it piqued my curiosity in seeing the original again. Frame of mind comes to mind. It's possible I just wasn't up to watching the perverted and vicious Jack Carter do his revenge number on the pornomobsters in his home town of Ugly, England. I just don't know, but it was like watching a new movie last night.Get Carter is still a dark and perverse revenger (watching the little sports car get pushed into the water and Michael Caine's bland reaction, his absolutely repulsive phone sex in front of his landlady, and the sociopathological way his knifes and shoots the scummier citizens he encounters actually gave me nightmares), but as a whole, the movie is a well-crafted and knife's edgy crime drama.Discovering that your first impression of a movie was wrong is not entirely a bad thing. Be patient with Get Carter. If you don't like it the first time, try it again in a different frame of mind. I know we all live fairly hectic lives, but movie lovers need to accept that sometimes the quality of a film seeps through the flaws.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Both the locations and Michael Caine's grittiness bring this story to life. Caine is superb; a rare inspiring role, which he milks to the nth degree. Jack Carter is a tough character, almost a psychopath, almost completely devoid of any human emotion. The characters affected by him suffer, even those on his side. Locations such as the car park in Gateshead chill even to this day; its eerie, grim emptiness a monument to film noir itself. Some of the lines are classics, and the deadpan expressions of both Carter and Kinnear during the card game are hard to top. "See what it's like Jack? You just can't get the material. Sometimes I think I'll just pi*s off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them". The amorality of Kinnear is displayed no better than in this scene. Of course, Carter's "So it's all girls together, is it?" tops off a great cinema moment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very good British gangster film, a classic in its genre. 30 years before Danny Boyle and Guy Ritchies's films, "Gangster n.1" and "Love honor &amp; obey", Mike Hodges directs a violent story -many scenes are very audacious and sadistic for the beginning of the Seventies...The films is set in Newcastle, in the poorest and most ill-famed parts of the town. That matches perfectly with bleakness of the gangster life described by the story! Also some shots are quite rough, there's something "dirty"...Michael Caine is excellent, as usual. The role of Carter suits him, he's extremely outstanding in doing a gangster who seeks revenge for his brother's death.A gem for British cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possibly the best on-screen performance that Michael Caine (Jack Carter) has given to date and he can be proud of that achievement as he carries 'Get Carter' to the top of the genre in a style that gained much from Mike Hodges' television based directorial style.Well heeled London heavy leaves "civilisation" to travel to Newcastle in the gritty, honest North East of England. Ignoring his gangland bosses advice not to travel he takes the next train out and, upon arrival, starts to piece together the circumstances of his brother's mysterious death. He follows the events by looking up old contacts in the underworld and also his deceased brother's tarty (and very well played)girlfriend. Jack Carter, as a true villain, is a born user and the trip up North is no exception. Keith the barman and the purple underwear laden landlady of the Las Vegas hotel are pawns in his game. A sub plot in the story (Carter seeing his bosses girlfriend behind his back)is magnificently handled and when the London gang are revealed as having joined forces with Cyril Kinnear's Newcastle outfit to hide up the death (through an illegal porn racket), it all kicks off in a brilliant climax where Carter manipulates a chance to go head to head with Kinnear's sleazy wannabee bag-carrier Eric Paice, whom he suspected all along. The final twist in the tale thereafter sets this film apart from run of the mill gangster films.Ian Hendry (Paice) sadly had a severe drink problem throughout his acting life and was almost fired from the film twice - most notably for getting p***ed before the racecourse scene where Caine removes his shades to reveal his genuinely alcohol fuzzed eyes. Caine kept him at arms length throughout the entire association and this certainly added a tension to the acting. John Osbourne - successful 1960's playwright returning to his acting roots - is perfectly cast as Cyril Kinnear. His whining, calm, sinister voice contrasts superbly to Caine's arrogant delivery in the scene where Jack Carter enters his mansion un-invited, to interrupt a card school.The second scene (and also the title sequence) in the film is of particular interest. Look at the passengers in the train carriage, sitting alongside Carter. Notice something strange? Look again - the hired gun at the end of the film (yes, the signet ring wearer) is sitting there, reading the newspaper, smoking a cigarette - on Carter's trail from the outset.Physical quirks are in here too. The arrival of Jack Carter sees him enter a pub (minus his cases - where did they go? - they re-appeared when he goes to Frank's house) and when he menacingly scans the inside of the pub to see who is around, an old guy in a flat cap raises his glass to drink. Look closely - he has 5 fingers and a thumb. Great stuff.The film gained more recent popular exposure when Ted Turner, through TCM, brought the MGM back catalogue. Subsequently, TCM run the film on Sky Satellite in England every so often and quite right too. It is a classic and every scene is memorable.Superb haunting theme music too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers follow: A gritty depiction of a gangsters revenge on those who killed his brother. Caine plays a nasty cold-blooded killer with no conscience. Much more realistic portrayal, including the surprise ending, compared to Stallone's weaker 2000 version. When will Holywood realise that most stories do not have happy endings, especially those about gangsters? "The Godfather"(an exception) was done right but if you want happy endings go see "Sleepless in Seattle" not "Get Carter" (or "The Vanishing" for that matter). Also the lead character does not have to be a nice guy wronged (like Stallone) he can be evil (and therefore more realistic and like a gangster) as was Caine. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Get Carter is one of the better 70's action imports around. It's not the most well-written movie, but it provides some great action and acting. It spends a little too much time setting up the twists and turns of who really killed Frank, and there are a few scenes that were just extra fat and slowed down the film. The directing is solid. Some real nice shots, especially during the action scenes, but Hodges can be rather bland at times. Michael Caine really carries the film. it was back in his heyday as an actor, he is just as uber-cool in the role as any other gangster in film at the time. I liked the idea for the ending, but I didn't like the execution of it.It's standard 70's action stuff. It has some good acting and directing thrown on top, but it's still not the greatest in the world. I would recomend it, though.7/10* * */ * * * *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Get Carter is without a doubt one of the best gangster films ever made. Even though I'm especially fond of action movies it's easy for me to see that this is truly a masterpiece in cinematic history. The story of Jack Carter coming home to find how his brother died wasn't even original in 1971, but the further outcome is. Michael Caine, an actor I've never thought of as a man of action, gives maybe his best performance ever. His ability to show: Anger, hate, sorrow and regret with just a look, is astonishing. He shows no mercy towards those who have hurt his family or try to hurt him. Violence is then of course inevitable, but the good thing is that it's realistic. The camera doesn't focus on the graphic violence like in many of today's films, but rather just gives you a glance.The movie is close to perfect. I recommend it highly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film for all seasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film thirty years ago and the images of the film remain clearly in my memory. I saw it recently once again (this time on TV) and my initial impressions of my first viewing remain. It is a superb film, well-packaged by Mike Hodges (the only film I have seen of Hodges) and well acted by Michael Caine (almost as good as he was in "Sleuth" and "The Italian Job").What are the images that impress you? The closing two minutes stun you. The image of Michael Caine in his birthday suit viewed by a small girl in a musical band marching past the house is another. The image (a crane shot) of two sets of black cars solemnly and simultaneously entering and exiting a churchyard for two separate funerals is another. And Caine is reading "The Long Goodbye" when he looks up at a co-passenger in the train we see later in the final scene, wearing the ring "J".The music of Roy Budd is another highlight of the film. And Budd uses tablas to embellish his musical score. What an effect!I have often wondered what made Hodges cast in a major role the "angry young" British playwright John Osborne ("Look Back in Anger") as an underworld boss in a film in which Osborne did not apparently contribute to the writing. The film is a credit to British cinema in several departments--direction, acting, casting, photography, music, editing and screenplay. It is almost a complete film. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched this film so many times, and I don't think I'll ever get bored of it. It is a landmark British film and is a milestone in Caine's CV. This is one film where he is flawless!Jack's bro is dead. Jack goes home, to Newcastle, for his funeral. (IF you've seen the film, you'll probably like the ambiguity in that last line?!) Jack doesn't think it was a drink/drive accident, he suspects murder. He's right.The film follows Jack Carter, a no-nonsense, ruthless man who is a top London gangster's right hand man. He has a reputation and is known to a lot of people. Caine is powerful in the title role and he displays enough menace to subdue our perception of him in other films such as 'Alfie', and 'The Italian Job'.The plot is very difficult to follow if you are not concentrating 110%. Some people have complained that they can't keep up. Nonsense. If you want to keep up - you'll keep up! This film deserves at least 5 viewings in order to pick up the very subtle inputs that the film possesses *****PLOT SPOILER***** for example, have you noticed the man who finally does 'get Carter' is sitting with him on the opening train journey??!!Of course let's not forget the fact that Jack Carter is himself a 'bad guy'. He kills people for a living. Not exactly an upstanding pillar of the community is he? That's where this film succeeds, we care about Carter, so we're on his side, even when he's doing the most vicious acts, and there are a few!!! *******DEPENDING ON HOW YOU READ THIS BIT, IT COULD BE A PLOT SPOILER******* Of course in Jack Carter's world, you live by the gun and die by the gun, so what goes around, comes around. You have to question as well, your feelings at the end of the film.Yes a great film this is. I have yet to see the remake, but why remake a classic? If something ain't broke then don't fix it!!!!The style in which it is shot is good. The music is legendary, and the locations used in Newcastle reflect Jack's feelings and profession - he is very cold, harsh, and tough.Long before the birth of Lock Stock, and Snatch, this film set the bar for which all other Brit Gangster films would be judged. "Caine IS Carter". Watch it, I guarantee, you will not be disappointed!PERFECT 10Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After viewing the 2000 remake of this gangster film classic I decided to invest more time with the original( Which I had never seen ) since as a rule the original is always more superior to any remake. What I found was a film that is more consistently violent, grim, and most unpleasing to those who enter expecting something along the lines of Payback. Make no mistake this is a hardcore badass crime movie that dosen't soften the supposed bad/good guy like Payback or Stallone's remake of Get Carter did. Everyone who crosses him dies a most painful way, and he's not afraid of hurting innocent bystanders either. And I even liked the fact that the movie wasn't afraid to kill off its protagonist in the end as most big budget blockbusters tend to shy away from these days. See this movie if you were sickened by Stallones Carter remake ( or shall I say over-bugeted music video {kinda like Pearl Harbor}) see this one.

The many supporting characters, including the landlady, and the girlfriend, played by Britt Ekland, who's phone sex scene still titilates today, all add depth and reality to the plot. The ending too is far more realistic than that in the latter movie - check them both out! This is definitely one for your personal film library.</fullReview>

This film is heavy on the violence but strong on story line and full of atmosphere, the early 70s Newcastle of industrial decline is employed well by director Mike Hodges.

		<shortDescription>Vastly Superior</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie about a year after viewing the 2000 remake (which was a pretty bad film).This version of Get Carter is vastly superior. This Carter is pure evil. He always has an agenda. People arn't even sure if Jake's brother's kid is his or if it is Jack's. Carter is that evil.This version also has some memorable scences (which are in its trailer/preview). One such scene is where 2 thugs break into Carter while he is making love/sex. Basically, the 2 bad guys are sent packing by 1 naked Carter.While both versions help explain the other (ie seeing the 2000 one helps through some of the Brittish sayings in this one sinc eyou know what is coming. Also this one helps explain why Caine plays a villan in the remake).In general the remake held pretty close to the storyline, but it cut out some of the best scenes, plus Caine can actually act, plus this Carter has a surprise ending.Of course to know that you'll need to Get Carter.Vote: 7/10 (seen on DVD)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Touch of Grey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story of a man trying to track down the alleged killers of his brother would have been, in my opinion, merely okay were it not for two factors. The first is the unique performance of Michael Caine, whose complicated Jack Carter character is an outstanding display of a man's delicate struggle between calm control and wild-eyed rage. When an actor gives his character that depth in his performance, it places a whole new level of depth to the film itself. Michael Caine, I believe, is one of the all-time great actors, and this film is a good showcase of his talent. (I haven't seen the Stallone version, but perhaps this might account for the success of one and the failure of the other.)The other quality about the film that impressed me was the difficulty I had in believing that Jack Carter was really a "hero". He was, after all, a self-confessed "bad guy" dealing with bad guys, yet I believed that his mission had good intentions. So I had that conflict, that "grey" area, which gave the film a unique element that's missing in so many similar types of movies. Very good- I gave the film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent British gangster movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent film starring Michael Caine who portrays a bespoked London-based gangster named Jack Carter who travels a town in northern England to avenge the death of his brother. In the process of his search for his brothers killer, he discovers a secret about his brother's family which adds real depth to the otherwise cold and calculating Jack Carter. The film is set primarily in the town of Newcastle, which is poor, dismal and dark, a perfect setting for Jack Carter's methodical and violent version of justice. The film is very well done and the final moments exemplify the fortitude and authenticity of British film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is fantastic. Period. The plot and characteristics have been explained quite lucidly elsewhere. So all I want to say is...The acting, writing, score and direction are first rate. This makes Snatch and Lock Stock look feeble in comparison. This film is truly HARD and takes no prisoners. Caine is fantastic.I guess that it will not suit everyone's taste. Some will say it is too slow, to British, too laddish, too bleak, outdated scenery etc etc. Minor drawbacks that prevent a perfect 10. But if you are capable of going into a picture without prejudice, have a concentration span and take things as you find them in an intelligent manner, then I recommend this wholeheartedly. Unforgettable stuff and can withstand repeat viewings.9.5/10</fullReview>

The best piece of writing went into this to form a revenge mission that twists and turns at every angle. This is a contender for Caine's best performance on the big screen and they don't come much better.From the start of the opening credits over that train journey from South to North with the haunting theme music, we knew it all meant business...personal business. Michael Caine is frightening as Jack Carter, and he really isn't the kind of gangster you want on your tail if you are totally indebted to him.There are great performances throughout the supporting cast including the late Bryan Mosley (Alf Roberts of 'Coronation Street' fame)as a 'Big man, but in bad shape' racketeer. The total twist comes in the form of the ending of this movie-and what a twist it is!...I was in total shock when I first saw the final reels of this film, and it must remain as one of the most unexpected endings of all-time.This is an original-watch it and watch out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best British Gangster Film Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A superb tour de force piece of story telling, excellently cast and making use of authentic locations proclaim this the most telling of Britain's gangster films. It has often been copied, but never bettered. The gritty and seedy nature of the real locations, the panoply of accurately observed and flawlessly portrayed characters were well ahead of the cartoon-like cast of previous films. The no-nonsense uber-violent tone, and the accompanying sexual frankness can make for disturbing viewing, but it is this overwhelming sense of 'reality' which makes the film so intense and beguiling. The only thing that hasn't aged so well are the fisty-cuffs and portrayal of the violence. Michael Caine looks the part, but the way he pulls his punches slightly undermines the hardened edge of the film. Nonetheless 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Get Carter" has just been re-released on the big screen in Australia, and what a terrific and grimly funny film it is. Many British (and Australian) films have borrowed from this cult-classic of down-beat noir: "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"; "The Krays", "The Long Good Friday", "Chopper". Michael Caine is at his anti-hero best, helped by a great support cast (including English playright John Osbourne as the slimy Cyril Kinnear, and Peter Sellers' ex - Britt Eckland - who participates in the first phone sex on British film!). I can't imagine how the bleak Newcastle-On-Tyne locations will transfer to Las Vegas and other U.S. locations in the new version (In the original there is a run-down club called the "Las Vegas"), nor can I imagine Stallone in Michael Caine's role.

		<shortDescription>Renaissance time for one of Caine's best films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film at the beginning of the 1990's, just before it enjoyed its big cult following. Caine's acting was as wooden as usual, but for once it was appropriate. Caine plays a ruthless, cold character (Carter) out for revenge. In a way it's very similar to "Point Blank" (1967) in that, like Walker, Carter is devoid of any feeling and has little emotion about anything he does whether its shagging or killing. Some of the quotes have gone down in cinematic history and it is interesting to see just how many young people have been won over by this clever, though violent, film. This is probably because it really hasn't dated that much. The soundtrack, for instance, is very contemporary, and the film was made just before flared trousers started getting ridiculously whippy. As well as the grimy Newcastle background there is an interesting supporting cast. Amongst the usual British "rent-a-hood" characters we have an unexpected appearance by the playwright, John Osbourne who portrays a camp, creamily well-spoken Northern gang leader. The scene where he is playing poker with Carter is priceless.</fullReview>

Unlike movies of the Hollywood variety like the Godfather and Goodfellows, Get Carter treats it subject material very rawly and the picture/environmental quality did not feel stage set or anything like that. The story was very subtle and it may take repeat viewings to fully understand what is going on in terms of Carter's daughter, the porn video and how and why Carter's brother died. This movie precedes 8MM and The Godfather, a real thought provoker. A true classic, but not for the faint hearted!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As gritty as a sand pit, this is one tough film. Set in Newcastle (industrial city in the North-East of England), this is part gangster thriller and part kitchen sink drama. Michael Caine gives what I believe to be his best ever performance as the mob heavy going home for his brother's funeral. It turns into a hunt for his brother's killer that sets him against local criminals in a seedy world of porn and gambling. Caine basically spends the film being hard as nails and beating people up, and the film comes to a very violent conclusion. If nothing else, it's worth watching just to see Alf from Coronation Street get slapped around. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too disappointing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a start, I am only 21 so my perception of what was and is thought to be acceptable good film making might in some ways have been spoilt by the more recent sorts of films I 'grew up' with, but I was quite disappointed with Get Carter taken as a whole.The prime reason for me for giving this film a go lately was the recommendation of its plain striking atmosphere and given my personal fascination for the Tyneside area I definitely loved the 'authentic' setting of the scenery. It certainly is the thing I liked most about this work, but unfortunately that is almost it. Apart from this the film has some good moments (the very first few cuts of Eklands driving scene...like a couple of other elements this gets exhausting) and the somewhat nihilistic straightness and turns of the plot, let alone the congenial ending, are one thing I could highly enjoy on one side, yet on the other the story 'development' just does not seem to cope with implementing these aspects suitably - neither do including Caine most of the actors, who often enough appear slightly misplaced (for the role of Carter that unluckily does Not apply in the good sense of him as a resolute tough intruder in the northern criminal milieu..) and awkward, which adds to the artificial feeling of the storyline and Carter pulling (shagging and slaying) his mission through. At this point I do not want to vent extensively on some of the conflict scenes, especially around the final, because to me their pathetic setting and acting are too obvious a flaw.After all there are just too many things that do not work together. I left this film behind feeling that it was too half-heartedly conceptualised/made and undeliberately empty to really be that respectively quite overrated top classic some consider it to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a strange appeal to the English movies of the late 60' and beginning of the 70'. Socially, we find in that moment a peak in the usual arrogance of the British. Today, when the UK, indeed all Europe, is sliding towards cultural decadence, and artistic indecision, it is interesting to consider that specific social context, and watch what came out of it. Probably the best example of what i'm talking about is "the Italian job" which also stars Michael Caine. But this is a pretty good example.This is a detective story. One guy trying to correct a story sold to him, and thus remake the reality where that story goes. The basic structure was held for the remake, with Stallone, except there we have Stallone's muscles in place of Caine's British wittiness. That's the basic game. There are broken strings, pieces that don't fit, and Caine struggles to tell things right. In the middle we have mundane dramas, unsolved family issues, which matter very little. Yet, three things are to be noticed..one is the very use of the English rural/provincial landscape. It informs the mood, it evokes the shape that we need for this story: close-minds, unsophisticated gangsters, but a light world where it is apparently enjoyable to live; that's why it was so believable that Caine's brother might have died by accident;.Caine's character, he is the formalization of what i stated above. A sophisticated, stylish representation of what the "modern" British should be, after the humiliations of the world war, and the exaggerations of the 60'. He is on the top of the game, despite the final irony where the film ends. In a way his character here is no different than the one he performs in Italian Job. But the whole project is less arrogant and self-centered than Italian Job (where Caine says "the people in this country drive on the wrong side of the road"). .The unfolding of the story (spoilers herein). The solving of the mystery is allowed by a super8 film. This is a world where seeing means believing, and every character is there to confuse Caine's perception. So the fact that a film is the key to the game, makes the solution interesting (this aspect was kept in the remake)My opinion: 4/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

The merciless is not something normally associated with Michael Caine, usually remembered for the words "You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!" People expect The fun loving criminal of the Italian Job, only to see a cruel and ruthless man out for revenge with no remorse. Jack Carter returns to Newcastle to bury his brother but has a feeling something's shifty about the whole thing. Carter works his way up the food chain, if you've seen the new "Sin City" film, Marv's (Mickey Rourke) technique of 'asking pretty hard' may come to mind. Get Carter has none of the humour of modern English Gangster films, it is far removed from the comedy of Lock Stock or Snatch. It is simply a dark film in every sense of the word, from the eerie vistas of industrial Newcastle to its hero, or villain if you like. Get Carter is a must see, whatever kind of films you like, it will grip you until the credits roll.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic of its kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Get Carter' is one of the seminal British films. After seeing it on the big screen for the second time, I still consider it to be Michael Caine's best film. The plot is simple. Mob heavy, Carter, on hearing of his brother's death, travels to his home town of Newcastle for the funeral. No sooner has he arrived, than he realises he is being watched. Why? The rest of this excellent film deals with that question, and the more he digs, the grubbier things become. If this plot sounds familiar, it is. (countless Westerns have gone over this ground before). What separates this film from those westerns, and most other films dealing with the subject of revenge, is the matter-of-fact way it deals with the subject matter. Take the scene where Caine shaves in the same room as his brother's coffin. Or the offhand way he treats the landlady of the house where he takes a room while he hunts for his brother's killers. Mention must be made of Ian Hendry who plays a character named Eric Paice. Eric's a petty criminal, cum chauffer, cum enforcer, for Cyril Kinnear, the gang boss, wonderfully portrayed by John Osborne, the English playwright, author of: "Look Back In Anger". There's a great line from Carter when he encounters Eric at the racetrack. After some chit chat, Carter suddenly removes Eric's sunglasses. Eddie blinks like a mole emerging from winter hibernation. Carter says, `You haven't changed a bit, Eric. Your eyes still look like p**s holes in snow'! This is a film definitely worth seeing, as it's one of the defining moment in British cinema. The only other film that I can think of that approaches the raw realism of `Get Carter', is another ?forgotten film', `The Long Good Friday' It features Bob Hoskins. I see that they are re-making `Get Carter', this time starring Sylvester Stallone! I've got nothing against Stallone, but really, why bother?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Get Carter' is certainly an icon of British miserablism, however my most recent rewatching left me unimpressed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love British films of the 60s and 70s. Everything's very grey and very brown and the characters are thoroughly downbeat and pessimistic; there's also vile patterned wallpaper everywhere. The visceral kitchen sink drama is a British trademark that can still be found in later films such as Gary Oldman's 'Nil by Mouth' (1997) and Paddy Considine's 'Tyrannosaur' (2011).'Get Carter' is an icon of British miserablism, I first saw the film on TV when I was quite young, I liked it. I've had it on DVD for years and always regarded it as a nasty, hard hitting classic. However, after watching it again in 2013, I was left rather deflated.There's no doubt that it continues to be drab and nasty. The abject horror of 60s architecture can be seen throughout the film; I think the brutalist architects of the 50s and 60s did more damage to our landscape than the Luftwaffe. 'Carter' really corroborates the saying 'It's grim up north', as the film's great climax shows that even the beaches can't escape the polluted, achromatic hell of the city. (I'm pleased to see that the beach has since been completely cleaned up)Despite this, the problem at its core is simply age, it has dated badly. The violence has no punch, quite literally; the choreography of Caine's beat-downs on various enemies is unconvincing and in some instances just risible. The worst example of this is when Carter manages to catch someone's fist and slap him round the face in a scene that is horrendously edited. There's also another moment where he lunges towards a woman (who cannot act) in a caf and wraps his hand around her throat in a highly orchestrated fashion.All of this amateurism is exacerbated by how, in this film at least, Michael Caine is not an intimidating figure. In 'The Long Good Friday' (1980), Bob Hoskins is short, stocky and has a very bad temper, however Caine, whilst cool and moody, is rather lanky and weak.The script is also dated, it's all 'bloody' this and 'you're a git' that. While there's no doubt that the British have an affinity for such words, it felt like the script was under the gaze of Mary Whitehouse (Well, someone more lenient actually, the ridiculous Whitehouse would even object to the lexicon of Get Carter)Aside from its age, I also found the story weak. It is basic, which can be great, however as the characters and their relationships are so unremarkable, Carter's straightforward revenge narrative suffers. I didn't particularly care for Carter and his cause, he's a blandly nasty character meting out justice to other equally flat characters.Caine is fine as Jack Carter; he has moments of great anger, especially in an emotional outpour in the film's final minutes. Outside of these moments however is a rather standard hard man stock character performance.While 'Get Carter' is still bleak and perhaps captures the zeitgeist of 70s working class Britain, it is rather dramatically unaffecting. After years of thinking it was a great film, I was left unimpressed by its lack of character development, its collection of poor supporting performances and its dated action and script. The shocking climax on that foul, polluted beach and Roy Budd's fantastic score are still high points, though.69%www.hawkensian.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is considered by many to be a masterpiece of British film making, with its bleak style, dark atmosphere and a great performance by Michael Caine as Jack Carter. While I do agree that those things are good about the film, there isn't much besides that, as there is a lack of likable characters or a really engaging story being displayed here.Firstly, let's talk about the writing and plot of the film. The story focuses on Jack Carter trying to solve the mystery behind his brother's death and that's about it. Maybe the plot is more complex than I'm making it out to be, but I honestly didn't care about the story for one main reason: I didn't like the main protagonist. This is because while other revenge thrillers try at least to make their main characters somewhat likable, Jack Carter is just a brutal thug who viciously kills without any remorse whatsoever. Maybe if we had a few scenes showing what his relationship with his brother was like, maybe this would be excusable, but as it is, he is just an unsympathetic thug who is about as two-dimensional as Paul Kersey from Death Wish, and we never care about Jack, meaning we never care about the story, and if the story is not engaging then what is the point of watching it?This isn't helped by the fact that none of the other characters are developed at all, with Britt Ekland being there just as a plot device, and the villains being very one dimensional. If they had least developed the characters a bit more with good and bad things about them, maybe we would sympathetic with them a bit more. That's what great movies about revenge do, like Watchmen, where we take the good and bad qualities about the characters and decide who the good and bad guys are for ourselves. We understand Rorschach's hatred for crime and society and how he wants to stop crime altogether, but he's a sociopath. We understand Ozymandias' quest to save the world, but he had to kill millions in order to do it. We hate the Comedian for raping women and killing people, but he has limits and has a lot of remorse for what he's done. Speaking of which, this is basically what this movie is like in a nutshell, it's like a movie where the main character is the Comedian from Watchmen, but without any of his remorse.One thing this movie is good at though is the action as it is well choreographed, and well shot, as well as the fact that the movie creates a bleak atmoshpere from the getgo as this is not a nice world and the movie exploits this to its fullest with the way it is shot, the constant downbeat mood, its all great, even if it is a bit dated. I don't need to explain how great the acting is, with Caine on usual top form and bringing much needed personality to a fairly weak character, and all of the other acting being very enjoyable in their roles.Overall, this is a mediocre movie, with more style over subtance, as despite the good action, acting, directing and atmosphere, the plot and characters aren't fairly engaging to me and the ending feels a bit tacked on. Overall, a mediocre movie which isn't the masterpiece that many claim.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Caine basically makes the whole film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found "Get Carter" to be a cool gangster flick, but not the masterpiece many other reviewers claim it to be. It had an interesting setup, but was endlessly confusing. Many supporting characters seem to arrive and disappear and aren't fully developed as they should be. The direction by Mike Hodges is very atmospheric yet slowly paced, something which most crime dramas shouldn't be. Despite owing a huge debt to this film, I feel "The Limey" surpasses it. One more thing which isn't exactly a flaw, but being an American, I had some trouble understanding the accents at times and had to turn on the subtitles. The score is good but repetitive. The editing is very good with some nice montages and there are several standout sequences (most of the sex or sexual scenes are memorable).The one thing that is superb about the film is Michael Caine. Caine was always a terrific (not to mention terribly underrated) actor who was always above the material. Here, his performance is cool, quiet, yet with much more depths than suspected. The scene where he watches the porno reel starring his niece is some amazing and emotional acting, adding a whole new layer to the character. Carter is an interesting individual, the only one in the film, and Caine basically makes the whole film. "Get Carter" is overrated yet still watchable. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's all double Dutch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A villain, Jack Carter, (Michael Caine) has returned to his home town of Newcastle to investigate his brother's suspicious death. Carter has spent years in London but has miraculously lost all traces of his native accent and adopted a kind of Cockney brogue. Even stranger, all the residents of Newcastle and district have also lost their local accents, even while continuing to live there, and they speak with a kind of undefined, pseudo-Northern twang.There are two exceptions. One is Carter's friend Keith played by Alun Armstrong and the other is the scrap dealer, seen early in the film, and played by Alan Hockey. Both these actors have local connections. These inconsistencies render the picture immediately false, although apart from this major criticism it is all it is cracked up to be, a gritty and involving British gangster picture.If you believe the accents don't really matter, imagine a film set in Scotland where all the characters speak with a Dutch accent. Of course, to viewers unfamiliar with the inflection of North East England this may not be too noticeable or important. It is surprising that this glaring anomaly is mostly ignored, unnoticed or glossed over by commentators on this website and elsewhere. Regarding the film, Carter has little affection for his home city and is bent on retribution as he wanders through a series of grimy locations which contrast with the affluent lifestyles of crooks Kinnear (John Osborne) and Brumby (Bryan Mosley) who live in the countryside. There are no 'goodies' in Get Carter, everyone has a past or something to hide, and revenge is the key to the plot as Carter is an avenging angel (or devil), who eventually succumbs himself after wiping out several of those involved in his brother's murder. The locations are often striking - a car driven at speed along the quayside under the Tyne Bridge, the gun battle on the Walker-Hebburn ferry, Carter's pursuit of Eric (Ian Hendry) on the coal staiths at Blyth and a dawn police raid on Kinnear's mansion. The film portrays crime and criminals as something unpleasant, nothing glamorous here, vengeance is nasty, brutal and swift. Not one to make you feel uplifted, but nevertheless one of the best British crime pictures.Just a pity about the accents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: As good as it gets!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Hodges' 1971 classic Get Carter is quite easily one of the finest Gangster flicks ever made. It's arguably the most formidable example of the superiority of British Cinema over its much-hyped American adversary: be it in terms of style or substance. Even after four decades of its release the movie appears remarkably fresh to the eyes. In fact, it has a lot to offer to the current and upcoming breed of filmmakers. Be it direction, screenplay, editing, cinematography or music, Get Carter scores heavily over most movies of its kind. The movie is strikingly bold in the manner it presents its subject and exudes a sense of contempt for the pusillanimous style of filmmaking generally present at the time. Get Carter offers gore, intrigue, voyeur galore. There are heinous mobsters and their uber-sexy molls, and then there is Jack Carter who neither forgives nor forgets. Michael Caine delivers one of his all-time best performances. As the vicious gangster Jack Carter, Caine is like an unstoppable force that proceeds with the intensity of a madman possessed by the devil. The rest of the cast complements him really well. Hodges and his technical team offer great attention to detail resulting in scenes that will stay with the viewer for ever. There is an obvious undercurrent of dark humor that's almost a norm with British filmmaking. Get Carter has a strong sense of pathos and irony which elevates it to even higher levels of brilliance. Get Carter is timeless cinema that has enough to engage the masses and aficionados alike. So, if you are on the lookout for intelligent cinema that's also high on entertainment quotient then Get Carter won't disappoint you. http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good slice-of-lowlife crime drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Caine is very good in what is basically a British version of a Charles Bronson movie. Carter (Caine) a low-ranking mobster, is targeted for termination by higher-ups, but refuses to go quietly. The operation to do away with him gets increasingly messy and pyrrhic as Carter fights back and leads his would-be killers on an escalatingly bloody chase through the backstreets, alleys and docks of grungy downscale London. London itself has a strong presence in the film, but is not the London of James Bond. Here the cityscape is dirty, modern and crowded, filled with angular rusting steel, packed with vehicles and polluted air. There are few plot surprises here, but solidly competent action movie-making and a good central performance by Caine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In England emotionless hit man Jack Carter (Michael Caine) travels to Newcastle to see about his brothers death. The police said it was accidental--he's convinced it was murder. Slowly things get more violent and dark.I don't think this is a masterpiece of cinema like some think it is but it's not a total bomb either. For its time this was revolutionary. It was bleak and cold and there's not one character in this film that you can root for. Also the violence was pretty extreme with some really shocking treatment of women. Seen today it's not so fresh. We've had plenty of dark films with no likable characters and extreme violence. Also, by today's standards, the violence was pretty restrained. I also found the first hour completely boring--it picks up a lot in its second half. Still, this is well-made--it's beautifully directed and Caine is just great in his role. Also all the settings are drab and grim which just add to the feeling of the story. This wore me down eventually--I was thoroughly depressed by the end. Still, it's worth catching if you're into movies like this. I give it a 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get Caine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Caine had already starred in a number of impressive movies when he starred in "Get Carter". As London hit-man Jack Carter, he attends his brother's funeral in Newcastle, but then gets suspicious that his brother's death was no accident. Caine brings to this role his usual cool, something required for crime-related movies, in my opinion. If absolutely nothing else, this movie is a look at Newcastle in the early '70s (that device at the end is pretty unusual). One eye-opening scene is when Carter is talking on the phone with Britt Ekland's character - although it will probably only be of interest to teenage boys. It's surprising that director Mike Hodges hasn't had more of a resume since this movie. And I think that most of us would agree that the remake with Sylvester Stallone was pretty unnecessary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, it's a Seventies period piece and won't strike a chord with many outside Britain, but it's masterfully directed, photographed and acted. Although Caine's character originally came from Newcastle, years in London have left him as a clear outsider in the criminal underworld back up North and his sharp-dressed menace makes him stand out like a sore thumb among the rougher local gangsters.It's a fairly simple revenge tale with a moral, unlike the execrable Stallone remake. There are some famous set pieces such as the Gateshead multi-storey car park, the High Level Bridge and the ultimate denouement on Blackhall Rocks. The final scene will stay with you for a long time after watching the film.A couple of small negatives: Britt Ekland is wasted - she's probably just in there to ensure an 18 certificate; and the opening London scene is badly acted. The reason for this is apparently that it was re-dubbed for American audiences, to fit their preconceptions of how gangsters ought to speak!Eminently quotable and with locations that are familiar to many viewers, this is one of the most important British films of the late 20th century.</fullReview>

There isn't much I can add to the praise for this film, but alongside 'Villain' and 'The Long Good Friday' it is one of the best gangster movies ever made. Watch and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inevitable flecks of Postmodernism and disturbing ambivilence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over 30 years after the film's initial release, "Get Carter" has garnered both inevitable flecks of Postmodernism (Due in part to Caine's presence) and the distinction of maintaining a disturbing ambivilence. Caine appears as the eponymous London villainin this slick and efficient comment on polymophous immorality - from then first-time director, Hodges ("Flash Gordon" and the later Caine vehicle, "Pulp") who exacts murderous revenge on the inhabitants of Newcastle responsible for the death of brother; and uncovers a web of pornography and proficient deceit, matching its literary cousin "The Big Sleep". Caine was both astute in his choice of director and in supplying a suitably suppressed performance, as the homoerotic killer who, like all iconic British screen gangsters, is intensely narcissistic and therefore never inward-looking. The package presented is of emotional duality and dupiciousness as dark humour and perverse sex compete with ribald comedy and brotherly love. A rare example of a film that presents succint characterisations(From a mostly excellent: including Ian Hendry as the patently immoral Eric Paice and John Osbourne in the role of the sickeningly unctious Kinnear), "Get Carter" confidently smashes the comforts of perfuctory nationhood, engendered in War-time film-making, as Carter becomes further embroyled in his autonymous killing spree. Problems with the film are thankfully few, but probably include a slight yielding to an episodic quality for the murders featured - potentially opening the film to accustaions of popularisation - damaging or perhaps even heighteng the film's moral posture.</fullReview>

The main plot has Carter going back home to Newcastle to demand answers as to how and why his brother died, on going there he finds he is not exactly welcome, this is a super cool British thriller, from the fantastic opening titles, with the great theme music, to the scene where he walks out the front door with nothing but a rifle to protect his manhood. Cain gives the performance of his career, as the relentless 'hitman'. Carter goes on a 'join the dots' mission to find out what has gone on, up in Newcastle as he tries to find out why his brother died he also finds out a few truths, and finds his brothers' daughter( or is she his? ) starring in a 'home movie' he quickly picks up the pieces and seeks revenge, but is revenge sweet, or is it at a cost??? in this very stylish film-noir gritty drama from 1971 revenge suddenly turns sour.STAY AWAY from the very, very, very bad Sylvester Stallone 2000 Re-make.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic British Seventies Tough-Guy Gangster Revenge Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When his brother dies in mysterious circumstances, London gangland hardman Jack Carter goes back to his old hometown of Newcastle to investigate. In a shady underworld of bigshot gamblers and sleaze-merchants, he gradually uncovers a conspiracy behind the death and extracts his own brand of revenge.This gritty, exciting, cult crime classic has three great things going for it - firstly, it's a bonafide top-notch British gangster film, of which there are almost none (The Long Good Friday is about the only other one), secondly, the setting in the murky grey north-eastern town of Newcastle, all drab concrete eyesores and crumbling Victorian terraces, and thirdly, an unforgettably steely-eyed, no-nonsense, indefatigable performance by Caine as Jack. Brilliantly written and directed by Hodges, it's a great puzzle of a story in the classic pulp-fiction style and half the fun is in trying to figure out who, if anyone, is telling the truth. It also has several excellent set-pieces; Jack's unabashedly erotic phone-call to Anna (Ekland) while his landlady (Dunham) is in the room, the scene where he ejects two goons from a house while wearing only a shotgun, and the memorable finale on the beach. Wolfgang Suschitzky's kitchen-sink photography is also a great document of seventies Britain, in everything from the shots of the nuclear chimneys, to Caine's blue Ford Cortina to Beckley's beige leather jacket. The supporting cast are a great bunch of British lowlifes, notably the original angry-young-man playwright Osborne, and the reliably psychopathic Hendry (for more of him, see The Hill), and Dunham, White and Ekland (who gets billed fourth but is only in one scene) assure the film's cult status by taking their clothes off at various points. What really makes Get Carter unique though is the character of Jack himself; the classic style in this type of story is to make the antihero tough but moral - Jack however is a single-minded psychopath who kills his brother's murderer but also kills five other people on the fringes he doesn't like. With the exception of perhaps Lee Marvin in Point Blank, he is the ultimate movie hardman. Extremely well-made, with terrific punchy dialogue throughout and great editing by John Trumper. Based on the novel Jack's Return Home, by Ted Lewis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Carter (Michael Caine) is a London gangster who goes back to his hometown of Newcastle to find out the truth about his brother's death (side note: there's a great train sequence as the opening credits are shown). Once there, we follow him around for 3 days through the world inhabited by easy women, various small-time organized crime figures, pain-in-the-ass landladies, etc... He walks around, gets into tense yet witty conversations with people potentially involved in his brother's end, charms women, gets tougher with the people mentioned above, charms women some more, and finally connects the dots with a crucial piece of evidence and goes on a revenge killing spree. And there, I just gave away the whole movie!!!Well, not quite. Even though the story is very simple and cheesy, the movie contains many interesting details and nuances that ultimately make the difference. You see, Carter is not your usual lower-rank thug you'd expect to find employed as enforcer by the mob. He's equal parts James Bond and Inspector Poirot with even a little bit of Travis Bickle. He does it all: investigates, beds women, kills and feels no remorse to boot. I was very thankful for the lack of sugarcoating of his character by the filmmakers; he's shown as he is - driven, reserved, cold, calculating and at times downright evil. This guy is definitely not a hero yet he IS the hero of this story. Only person he displays any kind of compassion for is his late brother's daughter Doreen (Petra Markham) and later on we find its more than a mere concern for relative's welfare as the movie leaves us with reasonable doubt whether Doreen is in fact his own child. Carter's 180-degree turn from cool-as-a-cucumber '70s Mack Daddy at the beginning of the picture to raging killer by the end is more understandable in light of this fact.The name of the game here is most definitely style not substance and "Get Carter" has plenty of the former (phone-sex scene with his girlfriend/mistress Anna (Britt Ekland), Carter wearing nothing but a rifle while getting rid of his London mob friends who've come up to Newcastle to take him back, etc... are couple of examples), although maybe not quite enough to keep you interested for every one of its 112 minutes. Some of the dialogue needlessly goes on and on and there were occasions when I just wanted them to, as Mr. Burns from "The Simpsons" said, "stop with the yim-yam &amp; the bleez-blaz and get to the bloody point". Having said that, I really do admire the movie's slow pace and time it takes to set the scene visually. Newcastle hills, harbour, narrow streets, factory chimneys and dingy waterfront where the final showdown takes place all add to the atmosphere. My only previous knowledge of the city comes from its football (soccer) club Newcastle United and their stadium St. James' Park so I was extra thankful for this tour of sorts through the industrial town.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For an American audience raised on the Godfather and Goodfellows, this movie might not be your cup of tea. I'm an American and I did like it, although it does not measure up to the Godfather, which was made just a few years later. I love Michael Caine and many of the scenes were very effective in conveying the mood and grittiness of the characters and settings of Newcastle.The main problems I had with the film are its pacing and editing. The movie is slow; a lot of panning and a lot of re-tread over the same areas. I don't mind a slow movie, but there has to be more going on then just walking, panning the countryside, panning the bar, panning the train - all in excess. The movie does eventually pick up , but you've got to be patient and I think this is asking too much from many American audience members (this is just a generalization, I know that there are plenty of people who won't mind it).The movie can be very choppy at times - so much so that you lose the flow and congruency of the action on the screen. Also, Some of the fights and shoot-outs will cause you to laugh because they're so fake. At the same time, there are some really good edge of your seat moments that more than make up for those short comings.Another thing I find interesting about this movie is Michael Caine's character. I thought he was going to be the brooding, dark, lone badass ala Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson, but there was, surprisingly, a lot of humor and James Bond-style randiness injected into his character. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this stuff and thought it was funny, but it snapped me out of the underworld mood and realistic feel of the movie.I gave this movie an 8/10 and I only recommend movies to my friends that I rate an 8 and higher. I almost gave it a 7, because I do have some friends who would not like it due to the issues that I mentioned above. Ultimately, for the time period, this movie had some cutting edge stuff that even I as an American can appreciate.</fullReview>

In this one he plays a gangster who is addicted to shooting people in the head from a vantage point (preferably on a beach). Anyway, Carter decides to have an enjoyable day with his rifle at the beach. He walks along the shore, throws his rifle into the water, swims out to retrieve the rifle, then throws it back in the water again for no apparent reason. He spends most of the afternoon retrieving his rifle from the seafront.As the film draws to a close, we see Carter buying an ice cream, trying to assemble a wooden deck chair (a hilarious scene - the deck chair keeps collapsing every time he sits on it) and finally being shot in the head by a random lunatic.This early 70's gangster comedy is still one of the finest in the genre, even outdoing The Godfather in the laughter stakes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gangsters in Newcastle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kind of complicated revenge movie. Michael Caine is Carter, a London gangster who learns his brother Frank has been murdered in their home city of Newcastle. Against the advice of his London friends he returns home, sees to his brother's funeral, discovers his brother's murderers and their accomplices one by one, and either murders them or sees to it that they wind up in jail -- or gaol. He discovers that Frank was killed because he found out that their young sister, Doreen, had acted in a pornographic movie. Frank was eliminated before he could drop the dime on the porno ring.I found myself comparing it to other revenge movies to figure out why it doesn't quite meet the expectations most of us bring to the viewing experience. In the similar "Point Blank," Lee Marvin is betrayed, shot, and left for dead by his traitorous accomplices, so the deaths that follow seem somehow justified. In Fritz Lang's revenge movies -- "The Big Heat" and "Rancho Deluxe" -- the protagonists seem obsessed with justice, to the point of injustice. In "The Bravados," Gregory Peck kills only those who have already been convicted of murder. In "Nevada Smith", Steve McQueen kills only those who have slaughtered his parents and made a tobacco pouch from his mother's skin, and even he relents at the end.In this film, the springboard for mayhem is the appearance of Caine's younger sister in a skin flick. That's what leads directly to the death of Caine's brother, the deaths of his murderers, and ultimately to the death of Caine. And it isn't enough of a motive. Caine even murders a helpless girl who held information from him. Only two of Frank's friends in Newcastle show up at Frank's funeral. Caine allows one of them to be beat to a pulp by the head of the porno ring (John Osborne, the playwright) and cares not a jot. The other friend, who has also withheld information, is deliberately stabbed to death by Caine. Caine does not play a typical "good guy" of the sort we're accustomed to in crime or action films. He's a much more complicated figure. After all, before he kills anyone, he comes into possession of an illegal skin flick and has the means to put all of the gang in jail, as in fact he does with many of them before the climactic violence. Unlike the protagonists of most revenge movies, his are murders of choice. It's all less about justice than about Caine's personal satisfaction.This sequential massacre could have been avoided by the legalization of porn movies. Now -- you'll have to excuse me -- I'm about to present a brief argument drawn from a school of sociology called functionalism. Porn has been around roughly forever. I've seen a stick figure drawing of a man with an erection in a 20,000 year-old cave in Les Eyzies de Tayac. I needn't do more than mention the red light district of Pompei, loaded with erotic murals and statues of Priapus. Our imagination can fill in the line up to and including internet sites like XXXOhBabyXXX.com. Porn wouldn't always be around if it didn't do something for society. Maybe it keeps the streets safe for our wives and children by acting as a substitute for the real thing. Maybe it gives women a chance at a career that they can choose of their own free will, the way the integration of baseball led to avenues of advancement for African-Americans and, later, for Hispanics. I now step away from the lectern. Thank you for your indulgence.Anyway, Caine is pretty good in a straight dramatic role but I prefer him in semi-comic productions. He can be truly funny when given a chance, although, to be sure, he's rarely, if ever, bad. The other players are good too, including Osborne whose face, except for its pretentious little beard, has all the interest of a hard-boiled egg. The direction is functional and the location shooting successfully evokes a dreary, grimy, industrial town in the North.Not a bad film, just a little hard to follow once in a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get Carter-Get Lost **</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Caine ventures to another part of England to find out who caused his brother's demise. Caine, a mobster, is violent and ruthless.With this in mind, you'd think the picture would turn violent right away. It took over an hour for this to happen and when the violence started, the bodies began to pile up in some of the most horrendous ways imaginable.Before that, we see Caine bed-hopping all over the place in the tradition of 1966's "Alfie."Everyone here seems to be under suspicion as we see the further of the seedy side of England.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring, tedious and poorly acted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Get Carter is not a very good or even great film to be honest. It lacks narrative as well as character, and Caine's performance is shamefully dull and embarrassing. The aspect that really lets Get Carter down though is the fact that it's really slow moving and immensely bleak.The direction is way below your normal action thriller because it's the other equations that bring the film down as a whole. The character's all seem over-confident and as mentioned before, dull. Nothing supports the cast or story because of how bad the direction is.This film is so Seriously overrated that you would cry if you couldn't get a refund of your money or time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tough and not too interesting mov</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MY RATING-6.3This is a mov I watched for only having one of the greatest actors of all time- Michael Caine. The film develops in a strange way almost in a Raymond Chandler flair but this one is set on British locations. The story turned to be a bit disapoitting at the end and it gets even more bizarre with that music! However it features one of the hottest girls of the 70's, Britt Ekland. Look at that erotic phone call made by Caine! Look also for `The Avengers' first season star Ian Hendry. Overall, a tough and almost mean mov that is not for all tastes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Long, slow, dreary, moody gangster film about mob thug killer Jack Carter (Michael Caine) hunting down his brother's killers, unaware of his own impending doom. There's plenty of grit and unhappiness and misery in this entry, and depending on who you are, you'll either love it or you'll hate it. Caine himself is good, but that doesn't necessarily mean you'll have a good time. Caine has a history of delivering good performances in meager films that are beneath his talents.But as Caine himself once said, if he couldn't get the really good parts, then he'd settle for the ones that would pay the bills and buy the food and what not.There's also some gracious sex thrown in for good measure, that is when Carter's not actually killing some hapless prostitute.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hmmm... Did we see the same movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to chime in here to add a different view point from the other (mostly British) posters. Although I didn't consider this movie horrible, I wouldn't consider it good either and certainly not "the best movie ever" as some have described it here. I might rate two out of four stars.I purchased the DVD based on the stellar reviews that I read here. This movie had great difficulty capturing my interest. It required multiple attempts for me to sit through it from start to finish (I won't have if I hadn't already spent the money to own the DVD).If you enjoyed "The Limey" or "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels", you'll might enjoy this movie as well (two other movies I purchased based on rave user reviews). If you didn't or find yourself bored watching most 70's films, I think you'll find this film slow and not involving.If your a Michael Caine fan, I recommend checking out "Sleuth", a much better film IMHO from the same period. If you enjoy revenge type flicks, try the recent Mel Gibson flick "Payback".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nonchalance can help make a cool flick - but it ain't enough to make a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand why Get carter was seen as a cool movie back in 1971. The hero is no longer monolithic, he walks straight on and acts out of stubbornness, not because he knows where he goes. And casual sex, pornography were sure explicitly fresh and new themes in the movies just after Woodstock.Well Get Carter is far from being a movie about a man struck by the absurdity of life and the need to find peace within himself: what surfaces the whole thing is nonchalance. Nonchalance is cool: things happen, the hero goes on through it, he kicks ass and he doesn't care.Thus Get Carter has its moments, mainly thanks to the editing, but for the rest it's cool attitude pleased with itself. And above all it's a shame to have Michael Caine as a lead and let him give no more than an average performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revolutionary gangster thriller that hasn't aged well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know how, when you were a kid, your parents played you boring old records from their formative years that you always hated but which they insisted were brilliant and innovative? Well, GET CARTER is like sitting through one of those failed attempts at parental bonding. In 1971, the film no doubt seemed revolutionary in its harsh depiction of underworld violence and betrayal, but these days it just seems corny. A lot of the violence isn't even done well.Michael Caine is okay as Carter, but he was never the most versatile or emotive of actors in the first place, so it couldn't have been difficult for him to look moody and fuming for the best part of two hours. It's impossible to care about any of the characters as they're all either weak, stupid or sadistic, and the production has the flat, grainy, harshly-lit look of a public information film. The score is haunting, but wasted on such a dull movie that spends a lot of time going nowhere.It's not trendy to say this, but the Richard Burton movie VILLAIN (which covers similar ground) is far better, and serious admirers of the underworld genre should give this one a miss and check out THE LONG GOOD FRIDAY instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ere! I want a word wiv you...!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never really been a Michael Caine fan. His performances seem too heavy-lidded and self-satisfied, as if rather than being on camera he would prefer to be lounging in his London restaurant, smoking a Bolivar. Like his friend Connery, Caine has created an archetype and founded an entire career on reprising it. A friend of mine bought me the DVD of Get Carter, and I surprised him by saying that I had never seen it before despite its considerable critical and cult reputation.Jack Carter is (as we are constantly reminded) an 'ard lad from the slums of Newcastle who returns home from London to investigate the sudden and mysterious death of his "bruvver". Brothers of hard lads obviously just don't die of natural causes, so he hangs around to 'stick his bugle in'. He is warned by his criminal chums in London to be careful as they have some 'hard nuts' up North. What he runs up against are a bunch of the most incompetent, limp and cartoonishly impotent gangsters this side of 'Home Alone'. John Osborne tries hard to appear suavely menacing as a purring porn-boss, but comes across looking more like an emeritus professor of poetry, right down to the patches on his elbows. Caine himself alternates his lines between either whispering Cockney or a snarling rictus and sounds at times laughably wooden, irrespective of his emotional range.In some ways 'Get Carter' is a product of the same period of unrestrained cinematic sex and violence that produced A Clockwork Orange, though without the arty pretensions. It has an anti-hero at its centre, realistic settings and a cast of grubby and generally highly avoidable characters. The trouble with this approach is that (as we all know from Hollywood) standards of sex and violence change so quickly that films with little else to offer date badly. Carter's conversion to avenging angel is never plausible because we aren't convinced he has the emotional capacity to feel that outraged. After all, isn't the brother he's avenging the same guy whose wife he impregnated? What follows is simply a gratuitous kill-by-numbers plot that tries to pack in the maximum number of gory deaths (by 70s standards) and finally ends with Caine (thankfully) being knocked off himself at his moment of fulfilment.Watching 'Get Carter' does have its scattered pleasures however, not the least of which are the bleak landscapes of Northern England (with accompanying howling wind on the soundtrack), Roy Budd's John Barry-ish score, and a masturbating Britt Ekland. Overall, given the passage of thirty years of ever nastier villains, the film has an almost cosy aspect to its violence that is actually rather endearing, like a cranky but charming old Jag Mark II. Watching it made me think of the Monty Python sketch about the gangster who went around nailing people's heads to the floor. "Lovely fella, though.."In short, a woefully dated revenge flick made frequently hilarious by its characters and setting. (One other inconsistency, as regards the opening train scene. British Rail never, EVER, travels that fast...) 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get Carter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't remember why the bad guys killed Carter's brother (probably because he knew something), but it's what Carter does that's important to me. Sir Michael Caine is perfect in the role of Jack Carter and he revenge for his brother's death, and he'll do anything, talk to anyone, and kill almost anybody to get his way (almost an anti-hero). There one or two good chase sequences, and quite a lot of swearing and violence to keep the pace going. Also starring BAFTA nominated Ian Hendry as Eric Paice, Britt Ekland as Anna Fletcher, John Osborne as Cyril Kinnear, Tony Beckley as Peter, George Sewell as Con, Geraldine Moffat as Glenda, Dorothy White as Margaret, Rosemarie Dunham as Edna, Petra Markham as Doreen Carter, young Alun Armstrong as Keith, Bryan Mosley as Cliff Brumby, Glynn Edwards as Albert Swift and Bernard Hepton as Thorpe. To be honest, the final moments on the beach are the best and most memorable, where Carter does get his revenge, but is gunned down by an unknown assassin, a mean ending, but a good one. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Supporting Actor for Ian Hendry as Eric. Sir Michael Caine was number 44 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 7 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, the film was number 82 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments for the scene where Caine has phone sex with Ekland, it was number 22 on The 50 Greatest British Films, and it was number 68 on The 100 Greatest Films. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If plot and story aren't important to you, see this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read many of the reviews posted here, heard about this movie from critics, and even found a copy on the BFI 100 shelf in my local video store. And yet, I found myself sitting through a movie which made no sense and for whose plot I didn't care a lick. True, some of my issues could be resolved by a second watching, but really I have no interest in that.Get Carter contains a plethora of characters, most of whom only play bit roles and are never truly explained. I still wonder at which of the many 'gangsters' Sid was! The back of the video box proclaimed a 'relentless pace'. Instead, the first 30 minutes leave you wondering just what in the world is going on. Now, I don't necessarily want a movie and its plot spelled out for me, but to leave the viewer completely in the dark is something completely different. I would agree with many of the previous reviewers that the locations and action are highly realistic (with the exception of Caine's pathetic jabs to the stomach of his villains), but who cares about realistic portrayals when the movie is BORING?! And it doesn't help when the director decides to hide important dialogue with conversations in the foreground. Perhaps highly original in the 70s, the presence of characters, animals and architecture obscuring the view of what is supposed to be the object of attention only annoys. I can only imagine, and shudder, at the version Sylvester Stallone may have recently made, but I, for one, plan to NEVER find out. If the original was this dull, I await to see the remake on the Bottom 100 list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand it at all. This movie has been universal lauded by critics and the general public alike as a quality film. Well, I think each and every one of these people owe me an apology. This movie is terrible. There is no other way to describe it.This is not the precursure to "Pulp Fiction" or "Lock, Stock, &amp; 2 Smoking Barrels". This is the precursure to a high-school sex-ed film.The plot is paper-thin, the flow is stagnant, the characters are weak. The British seem to have a template for making serious-minded crime drama : Get a brooding lead, throw in a bunch of "colorful" characters that pop up to reveal key plot points, play some jazz improv on the soundtrack and film it as a still life. The whole movie is michael caine asking questions about who killed his brother to a different person each scene. Just plain boring. I'm not sure if I'm watching a portrait or a movie!It's supposed to be about crime, right? So where are the insider secrets? Where are the tricks of the trade? These things are inherent to all crime films - I want to see detail...Carter could be a investment banker: you can't tell because he never does anything!To make a long review short, if you like plot movement or interesting characters or, I don't know, movies in general, then don't rent or buy this "film". You'll suffer through each scene wondering if this is the scene where it gets better only to discover that they all ...It's cinema improv born of the sexual revolution and the 70s. It has something to say but nothing to show on all level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why only British cherish this film.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's accept the fact that this is basically a character study of the ugliest human nature. I wouldn't herald it as so much a gangster drama as I would be more willing to say the mob idea is basically a motif. My only problems here are that the actions of the protagonist (Jack Carter) do not coincide with the character. Why would a hardened criminal care to pay for the laundry cleaning of a bloke who just had a glass of water splashed in his face? And to also add a sentimental gesture in his face to top it off doesn't seem fitting for a stone cold psycho killer. What was Jack's purpose for his rampage? He even murdered two people who weren't even affiliated with his brother's murder. Was it only vengeance he was seeking? Was his personal vendetta aimed toward just anyone who knew of his brother's death? Is this a revenge tale gone out of control just to show violence for violence sake? If Jack was so mad about his niece involved in a pornographic film, why is he himself a rapist, brute and degenerate scum? Is he a hypocrite? Obviously. This double-standard is not handled well here. This story doesn't really concern itself with an overall balance of morals. It presents crime and violence and basically shows how violence begets violence. I ask myself if anyone could have played the role as effectively as Michael Caine? I'm sure. Caine offered an uncanny and sinister quality to his character that straddled nonchalance with utter creepiness. But he doesn't look tough to me. I also have questions concerning the Kinnear gang. If they knew Jack was a threat from the beginning, then why would they wait so long to have him assassinated? The majority of the movie entails murder, bludgeoning and rough em' up debriefings which often don't get Jack anywhere. Why any woman want to have sex with a man like Jack Carter makes me think of the sexual prowess phenomenon of Ted Bundy. It seems just unbelievable. This movie is pure sleaze. It's scum versus scum. And it is very effective at keeping your attention. Why?! Because it plays on the "hate" formula. Jack Carter does such despicable things that you can't wait to see him get killed. He gets shot in the head at the very end with a rifle. I was hoping he would get mutilated in pain. The film is effective in showing industrial Britain in all of its grisly and wretched details. Michael Caine looks too pasty and flabby and not in good physical shape to play a tough guy. The only offset to this drawback is that all the enemies are flabby or wimpy themselves. It's apparent that most of the people touting this film are from the UK. They like to support each other. I also didn't understand the scene where Jack asks Eric Paice to take off his sunglasses so he can see his face. This struck me as very weird. If someone asked me to do that, I would say they need psychiatric help. Is this a British way of insulting someone? Is it supposed to be threatening. Whatever it is, it escapes me. If I were British I would be careful about how I choose my movie treasures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Get Carter is a film that tends to come under the bracket of a Cult movie and i still have yet to understand what that really means. If being a cult movie means that it is a great film than Get Carter wouldn't come in that group because it is far from great. It is a film that has not stood the test of time very well. It looks old. Maybe thats because it was shot in the seventies and it is an era that always looks old because of the fashion at the time but that does no account for grainy picture and the lame acting. O.K Michael cane does play quite a good villian but his delivery of lines is dreadfull and would be laughed out of the cinema today. His character lacks any charm and is quite vicious in his actions , regarding women. How this film can be compared to films such as lock,Stock and two smoking barrels is beyond me because it does not come close. It lacks any humour whatsoever and to me it resembles a poor episode of the British Crime show The Sweeney. Get Carter?......Get Lost. 5 out of 10</fullReview>
