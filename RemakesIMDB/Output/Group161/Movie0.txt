		<shortDescription>Perfectly watchable thriller - but little more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mob enforcer goes back to his native Seattle to sort out the suspicious death of his brother.The original film is one of the best English thrillers of all time and despite being made nearly thirty years ago still packs a punch. Sadly this film is not really in its league, despite a bigger budget and more ground coverage. The main problem is that the authors clearly love the original and this leaves so much of what happens as a question mark to the new viewer. Characters are thrown in from nowhere and Carters involvement with his bosses' girl is almost in another movie. Micheal Caine's small role (as a barman) is funny in that he was the original Jack Carter, here reprised by Sly Stallone.While quick to admit this is mediocre stuff you have to say that you get your share of car chases (well done too), fights, creeps, sleaze, family bonding, shoot outs and even the odd bit of light humour. The fight between Stallone and Mickey Rouke (here playing a buisnessman-stroke-creep) for example.This film features interesting cinematography, with strange forward jump cuts (ripped off from The Limey), odd angles and the use of colour filters. In short, the producers trying to make more out of the material than is in the script. The choice of a wet Seattle is also curious and different. Presumably the nearest to Newcastle-Upon-Tyne (the setting of the original) that the producers could think of. So it is only an average product, but will see much worse than this in our lifetime and it does move along at a fair and steady clip. People are getting to knock Stallone for being Stallone, but he doesn't do bad a job here, a stonefaced enforcer that is prepared to shed a tear when needs be! Not great acting, but he looks the part.Don't be put off by the low IMDB ratings, plenty of worthy films are two or three points higher but are far more boring. Popcorn fodder it may be, but I thought it was worth seeing through and even declared myself modestly entertained at the end of it. Not as good as the original but not a lot is.Footnote: This is actually not the first remake of Get Carter. A blackspolitation version was made in the 1970's called "Hitman."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get (the original) Carter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of the 1971 film with Michael Caine.Las Vegas mob enforcer Jack Carter travels to Seattle to investigate his brother's mysterious death. Local crime lords want him out, but Carter unrelentingly proceeds in finding the truth.Starting with a promising beginning (though it remains amusing that someone thought that Stallone can match Caine's acting) the film soon slumps into a bad case of mediocrity. It has the same idea as the original and tries to be as badass with its kinetic and almost experimental direction, but ends up being just poor. Stallone's Carter is given an almost soft side that goes complete against the character from the first film. On top of that there are some enjoyable car chases, but they serve as sensationalism that was critically lacking from the first film.Then there is the ending, which has some merit (since the film already establish Carter as softer then the original), but even so, it is still pretty stupid and leaves the film with little to say or resonate with. That ultimately makes this is second rate crime movie that you might enjoy, but don't count it. --- 5/10Rated R for violence and profanity</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another unappreciated film by an unappreciated icon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some unknown reason, the industry 'suits' have decided to black-list Sylvester Stallone, not giving him large leading roles, and when they give him a role, they refuse to heavily market his films. This trend started, I believe, sometime during the early 90s, probably after his last big hit, "Cliffhanger." Nevertheless, Stallone has continued to make films, most of them actually pretty good.That said, "Get Carter" is probably one of Stallone's better films of the last ten years (I think it's second to "Cop Land"). He portrays his role as the 'financial adjuster' (as he described it) Jack Carter. The remainder of the supporting cast, including Mickey Rourke, Rachel Leigh Cook, John C. McGinley, Alan Cumming and Michael Caine, each deliver convincing performances, conveying their characters' emotions with amazing quality.I really noticed the way the film's editing and photography changed towards the end of the film, after beating up McCarty (McGinley) in the elevator. The way the film swiftly cuts ahead a couple of seconds is simply spectacular to watch. The many odd photography angles describe the uncertainty of the scenes, and make me feel unsure as well.Living in the Seattle area, seeing the great landmarks I see every day on the screen is quite something else. And for the record, it doesn't rain nearly as much here as people think.If you haven't watched this film and have heard all the negative reviews given by the industry-paid critics, ignore them and rent it. You'll be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inferior Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The central figure of this film, Jack Carter, is a Las Vegas gangster who returns to his roots in Seattle following the death of his brother. This was officially reported as an accident, but Jack suspects that his brother may have been murdered by members of the local criminal underworld. The film charts Jack's attempts to find out the truth and to take revenge.This is, of course, a good example of Hollywood's cannibalising of the British and European film industries in its endless search for a good story. It is a remake of Mike Hodges's classic from 1971, one of the few great British gangster films. That film was one that grew out of, and yet at the same time transcended, a particular place and time, the North-East of England in the early seventies. This was a time of rapid social change in Britain, marked by increasing social mobility, growing permissiveness and relative prosperity, elements all reflected in the film. Like many of the best British films, it had a strong sense of place. Its fidelity to a real time and place was not a weakness but a strength, helping to establish it firmly in the realm of reality and to convey its major theme, the sterility and futility of the criminal lifestyle. Its view of the underworld acted as a necessary antidote to the tendency, very prevalent in the late sixties and early seventies, to glamorise criminals ("The Thomas Crown Affair), sentimentalise them ("The Italian Job") or mythologise them ("The Godfather").Stephen Kay's film attempts to establish a similar sense of place to the original; the Seattle we see has a bleak, forbidding atmosphere, always shrouded in rain or mist. It has a much more star-studded cast than the original, with at least one reasonably good performance from a convincingly thuggish Mickey Rourke. Despite this, however, it is a far inferior film when compared with the original. The main reason is the way in which the character of Jack Carter has been changed. Michael Caine's Carter was, for all his sharp suits and fast cars, no more than a ruthless street thug, a poor boy made bad at a time when other poor boys were making good. Sylvester Stallone's character, by contrast, may have a rough exterior (Stallone plays him as outwardly impassive, with a gruff, emotionless voice) but beneath it he is one of the good guys. The plot has been rewritten to make Carter less brutal and ruthless and to allow him to survive at the end. The original was a morality play on (as another reviewer has pointed out) the theme of "those who live by the sword shall die by the sword". The remake is simply a revenge thriller with a hero whom the audience can root for.This illustrates one of the perils of the remake. Kay's film has kept the title, the bare outlines of the plot and even some of the names of the characters, but completely fails to capture the spirit of the original. Moreover, it is unable to replace that spirit with anything new. If the film-makers had wanted to make an exciting goodie-versus-baddies revenge thriller, they could have chosen a better starting-point than the plot of a film made some thirty years earlier with a very different aim in mind.It has become something of a tradition for remakes to feature cameo appearances by the stars of the original films. Martin Scorsese's "Cape Fear", for example, featured no fewer than three actors who had appeared in the earlier J. Lee Thompson version, Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum and Martin Balsam. That, however, was a rare example of a remake that we as good as, or even better than, the original. Kay's "Get Carter", however, is not in the same class as Hodges's. It was, therefore, rather disappointing to see Michael Caine appearing in a remake that can only diminish one of his best films. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective. Complex. Layered. Well acted. Sharp. Smart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I simply do not get what certain people have against this movie. Sure, it's not a cinematic breakthrough, but it is very sharp, smart and focused. Jack Carter's brother, Richie, dies under mysterious circumstances. Jack goes back to his home town to check things out and perhaps find out the truth. What he finds is not all that easy to get to grips with.This is not your usual run of the mill revenge movie. The story has some layers to it and I am surprised to see that people did not appreciate that. Jack Carter is not a good guy. He is a bad man working in bad town doing bad things. Always was a bad guy. But he reaches a moment in his life when the things that take place between him and his boss's girl Audrey, the things that he finds out about his brother and his brother's family, all of them act as a catalyst. For once in his life he tries to set things right. How does he do that? By doing what he knows to do. He does bad things. The guys he goes up against are a little a out of the reach of the law. To wait for justice to set things right is not a concept Jack is familiar with. The only things he knows is to take care of his own dirty laundry. And at the moment his life is his dirty laundry. He was not there for his brother, for his niece and he missed some oportunities... Time to set things right. But he does only bad things in this movie. He kills people by shooting them, by throwing them out of the balcony, by beating them up in the elevator. WHY? Because these are the same things that would happen to him if he let his guard down.Great acting performances form most guys in the movie. Stallone seems to have found some serious acting genes within himself. This is some of his best work and his best is very good. Not only for the genre. Although when looking back at Oscar (his 1991 comedy), D-Tox (a very underrated movie) and Copland I have to say that this is not a one off. No sir. When the script, the director and the rest of the cast are good he can act big time. Michael Caine made a very good movie called get Carter back in 1971. I love that movie and is always one of my favorites to watch on Turner Classic Movies. The remake, I felt, is just as good. Sure it has the sort of usual happy ending, but that is just the American Way of ending action movies. They love a hero. Mickey Rourke, Alan Cummings, Michael Caine and Rachael Leigh-Cook are very good in this one. Somehow Miranda Richardson seemed a little over the top in her angry widow/mother scenes.Michael Caine acted in this one simply because he knew it was good. The movie could have been done without him, without a doubt. But he did it because unlike other remakes, this one is just as good as the original. It has it's own style, a somewhat different story and a happier ending. Otherwise, they are two very similar movies. And even if some consider the original as better, they should not write this one off. The layers are there, you just have to dig. And this only because the producers did not get this movie. The director, the cast, everybody got this movie and knew what they were making except for the producers who seem to have been thinking of another movie. Michael Caine seems to have given his seal off approval to Stallone's acting in this one. The producers wanted a classic 80's action movie. At least that's what I feel. So, this is a very good movie. Just as good (or almost as good, depending on how you look at it) as the original. It has great acting, sharp directing, nice car chase scenes, nice action scenes, some great moments, some wonderful music, a simple yet effective storyline that keeps you guessing and wanting to see more. And as someone put it, crap like XXX, The Fast and The Furious (+sequel, at least is has some cars), Charlie's Angels (+sequel. could not even watch) and other such teen-hormone-slang-flash-driven movies have a higher rating, IT SIMPLY ISN'T RIGHT!!!!!! 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Started well, ended badly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERS.As someone who ranks 'Get Carter' (1971) on my top ten list, I probably should have avoided this, but curiosity got the better of me and I finally got a copy of the re-make on VHS in a sale.It started well and there were some nice nods to the original film, notably Carter's traveling to Seattle by train, the theme music and of course Caine's cameo. Did anyone notice that the guys sent from Vegas came in a Jaguar? I assumed that Seattle was a good US version of Newcastle, northern, wet and gloomy.Unfortunately as the film progressed it became obvious that this was not in the same class as the original.In fairness, there was some good acting from Stallone and Rourke and the action sequences were well-handled and stylish, particularly the car chase. Unfortunately, that wasn't enough to save the film. The problem was that no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't help comparing it to the 1971 version.In the original Carter is cold and calculating beyond anything we have seen before to the point of being irredeemable and it was this facet that shocked audiences then and still does. He only shows emotion once, when he sees the 'blue' film, but this only stirs him into violence rather than reason. He kills without compunction everyone he feels responsible for his family's fate and those he can't kill he leaves open to the authorities. He is the ultimate 'hard man,' and when he says 'with me it's a full time job' you know he means it.Stallone's Carter should be in group therapy by comparison. He comes across as actually quite weak by the end of the film. In the original we never know for sure that Doreen is his daughter (rather than niece), but it is signposted. In the Hollywood version it is made explicit and the story loses a lot of impact, replaced by some sort of father-daughter bonding that is out of touch with Carter's character.BIG SPOILER - YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.The ending really put the cap on things. For those of you still reading this who have not seen the original (you have been warned), Carter is shot dead by a hit man after killing Paice. The irony is that Kinnear has ordered this not knowing that he is about to be arrested by the vice squad for peddling under-age pornography. All of this is lost in the re-make as Stallone's Jack Carter drives off into the sunset, presumably redeemed by his experiences.And with that, a classic is reduced to a good, but not great thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>slick editing can't hide the holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By far, the most entertaining moment on the DVD of "Get Carter" is the hilariously outdated 1971 theatrical preview for the original version of the film, which starred Michael Caine. (Caine does appear in this Stallone update.) Sadly, this update stinks. Sylvester Stallone's Jack Carter, a Las Vegas button man, skips town without his boss's permission and heads up to his old stomping grounds in Seattle to investigate the mysterious death of his brother, whom he hasn't seen in five years. That's the pitch.The action is surprisingly restrained and impressionistic. For example, when one of the minor bad guys gets killed, we see the result of a headlong plunge but not the actual slaying. But this kind of restraint doesn't dovetail with the promise of the previews: an ass-kicking Stallone in a Rat Pack suit. The director tries to gloss over the many plot holes with slick, faux-Fincher cuts and zooms, but he's just covering.Here's the tragedy. Action-thrillers don't require good acting, but they sure are enhanced by it. Most of the actors in "Get Carter" have the ability to far outshine this genre, much the way the actors in 1998's "Ronin" did-within the context of the plot, the cast of "Ronin" delivered their lines with utter conviction.Not necessarily so here. Those stars in "Get Carter" who have real talent weren't used enough, and those who don't have the strongest dramatic chops were given boatloads of screen time. Sly is wooden at times (as per usual), but has some fine moments.Miranda Richardson, as Carter's widowed sister-in-law, is solid, but underutilized. Mickey Rourke, as an internet porn purveyor, has obviously been working out some more, but it's still apparent that he peaked in "Diner." The big surprise was just how much actual characterization they allowed Rachael Leigh Cook--as Carter's bereaved niece--to show off. Any one of these actors, given enough on-screen opportunity, might have saved "Get Carter" from its ridiculous plot holes and incongruities. But they didn't. Do yourself a favor: avoid this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trendy, junky, phony remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Approximately 1/10th as good as the original, this version of GET CARTER doesn't even have the courage to use the original ending. And it is edited in today's hyper-trendy style using extremely brief shots edited together in a welter of images hoping to create an impression of kinetic action. Instead, it's just indecipherable chaos. Stallone tries his best, but his mustache and goatee have the odd effect of squeezing his lips together increasing his resemblance to a fish. He's also saddled with long, boring scenes with his niece (or maybe she's his daughter) that really don't lead anywhere. This has a different main villain than the original, but it's hardly a surprise since Mickey Rourke's character gives it away in his first scene. (But what happens to Mickey Rourke later? If he's dead, why wasn't there some kind of reaction from the numerous bystanders?) Stallone needs to forget about the audience liking him, and go for the realism of the character, but he never, never will show that kind of imagination and integrity. Showy, trendy junk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1971, the first of these action, violence prone films was offered. In the original novel, written by Ted Lewis, it was Michael Caine who was the unstoppable, revenge filled Gangster out to discover who killed his brother. In this updated version directed by Stephen Kay, we have Sylvester Stallone playing Jack Carter. Both versions were very well conceived. The updated film has added the blood, gore and non-stop drama which is common with newer versions. The story remains the same in that Carter (Stallone) learns his younger brother died under suspicious circumstances and he is determined to learn why. Along the way, he is met with business types who are not interested in helping Carter find the truth. To that end, John C. McGinley, Mickey Rourke and even Michael Caine get in the action. The movie is filled with dark sequences, black violence and thrilling chase scenes, all of which add to the final outcome. Great movie and a worthy successor to the original. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler's Ahead:Yes this film was a major bomb the numbers are undeniable. The original suffers in translation across the ocean. Caine simply does not have Stallone's physical presence. My title is what a lot of viewer's missed the film is not really about revenge. It appears to on the surface it is about a man who used violence his whole life to pay the bills working for some scumbag mobster coming back to his dead brother's family and expressing love for them and making up for not being there when they and his brother needed him the most. Yes he goes after and destroys the people who killed his brother; the reason why hangs over the picture everyone from Gloria to Con even Cyrus cannot fathom why does this hulking thug care what happened to Richie?Stallone Rourke and Caine are at the top of their form. Stallone was born to play this role and is far more convincing in it than was Caine in 1971. He radiates danger his scenes with Kinear are great; the understated threat communicated the Stallone way. These performances are worth the price of a ticket alone. Stallone is great at showing his own inner conflict about trying to experience caring and affection for Gloria and especially doreen. When he wishes to be Stallone can be a good actor; his main failing was always his choice of roles though in his defense he showed his ability in Copland. The scenes between him and doreen go well; yes I know the clichéd mumblings on top of the roof: hey, does he look like an intellectual to you? He plays the role perfectly; of course he stammers and repeats slogans this whole side of life is completely alien. He is trying is his own very awkward and sometimes unintentionally funny way to be a good person to Doreen and his family. The fight scenes are well put together and very believable. Cyrus beats him up as he should because "this ain't yesterday slick" but Carter rises bloodied but not beaten from the floor and finishes Cyrus off in a truly scary and powerful scene the Leone like close up of Stallone's face blood running down it is a really well done piece of work. The movie was never intended to be a frame by frame copy of the original which is good because Hodges picture was no masterpiece poor acting in the backup cast translation problems British to English and a crappy ending. This movie is about an evil person tired of being evil wanting to use his great strength and menacing presence for good to help his estranged brother's family. Yes I know revenge and the whole Christian religion are antithetical well not all of us are Christians. Like Carl Jung I agree that harnessing the shadow part of the personality can produce one of the most powerful forces for good: Jung always said most attempts end with the shadow overcoming and destroying the person who let it out but you get my point here: Stallone hates what he is for Fletcher; he is not all darkness. What he is doing however violent is his way of showing affection for his family. His scenes with Doreen underscore what I am arguing this is a violent man trying to protect and destroy the enemies that hurt Ritchie and still threaten them. It is a much more complex movie than the 1971 version in which Caine is a cold hearted goon torturing and killing along the path to mindless revenge. Caine gives that Geraldine an overdose not Cyrus in this one; he does this quite viciously leaving her dead on Kinnear's back lawn then calls the cops on him. On the surface they appear quite similar but Stallone's Carter is very different from Caine's Carter. One seeks to destroy and protect by destruction the helpless who are still in danger. The other is a stone cold killer using his brother's death to do what he enjoys most hurting torturing and killing people for entertainment.</fullReview>

If the people that made this had any intention of actually telling a story, I see no evidence of their efforts. Perhaps a comic book story board would have helped. Perhaps some honest people should have stood up in the screening room and said something, anything. Stop this. Don't release this. Go back to the cutting room floor, maybe you dropped something there. Maybe someone spilled a cup of coffee and shuffled some papers and kaboom, a chunk of the movie was lost. Honest mistakes happen. Don't tell me that this was deliberate. This can not happen. This makes the "New Coke" and "Ishtar" look reasonable. I watched scenes of Stallone's next movie "DRIVEN" being shot when it was called CHAMPS here in Toronto. The movie making machine was spinning during the MOLSEN INDY here in Toronto and right across the street from where I live. Bright lights on into the night here in Toronto as Stallone gets his next movie together. If its anything like "Get Carter" then the curiosity of the neighbour will not be enough to get me into the theatre. I got into "Get Carter" with free passes and it was worth every cent.</fullReview>

The worst part of the charactor development is that the negative life that Carter has lived never really catches up with him as it did at the end of the original. The only saving grace for this film is that smidgens of the original music sound track were used. Save your money and see the original even if only on video tape.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The impossibility of making good films in the 21st century is perfectly illustrated by this perfunctory remake of the 1971 Mike Hodges classic which starred Michael Caine as 'Jack Carter', a gangster who travels to the north of England to find out how his brother Frank died. This version shifts the story to America, and casts Sylvester Stallone in the main role. Caine himself plays 'Cliff Brumby'. The end result is a routine crime drama whereas the original is a classic. But what really takes the breath away is the ending. Instead of being shot on a beach, Carter jumps into his car and drives off. Presumably it was changed because American audiences hate films with unhappy endings. I take it then that if ( heaven forbid ) 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' ever gets remade, it will climax with 'McMurphy' building a jet pack and escaping from Nurse Ratched's institution by zooming Rocketeer-like over the fence. Have movies ever been quite as bad as they are right now?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why remake this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, the original version of this movie wasn't imposing so why bother to remake it? The storyline is Stallone plays a Luca Brazi type mob enforcer who heads home for his brother's funeral. When he gets home he learns some of his old cronies were responsible so you know the drill....revengeeeee! I say the only reason this movie is watchable besides the usual Stallone delivery is because of Rachel Leigh Cook...this was back when she was in her true prime and she is GORGEOUS in the movie.The movie is more cerebral than action so if you're into that sort of thing give it a look, otherwise better bring some pillows and a blanket.The highlight of the movie is the opening scene where Carter beats the shyt out of the dude and Con tries to talk him out of it 4 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sylvester Stallone's remake of the British classic GET CARTER has gone down in history as one of the biggest flops and worst remakes ever. Watching it now, I can see why; it's a completely forgettable film that might just pass muster as an average straight-to-video thriller but which feels like a catastrophe when compared to the original.The problems with this film are myriad, but most noticeably missing is the sense of location. GET CARTER made excellent use of its northeastern locations, whereas this remake just has an ordinary Seattle backdrop that looks like a hundred other thrillers from the era. It's not one of Stallone's finest performances either; he looks constipated throughout the production, which is a surprise given that he'd made the excellent COP LAND fairly recently which had contained one of his greatest performances.The casting of Michael Caine in a crucial role just reinforces how tedious and average this thriller is. Sure, the plot is fast paced, but the direction is hollow and the action sequences feel sub-par, somehow. I notice that director Stephen Kay has wisely stuck to television fare after the double whammy disaster of this and BOOGEYMAN (which was even worse).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stallone is engagingly tough, but he is let down by the average material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Carter is a mob enforcer in Las Vegas and heads back to Seattle for a funeral of his brother Richie, who has died under mysterious circumstances. The window of Richie's, Gloria isn't exactly thrilled to have Jack back into the fold for bailing on them for five years, but Jack gets on well with Gloria's daughter Doreen. Jack is willing to do whatever it takes to uncover the truth of Richie's abrupt death. The IMDb rating is about right for this one. I've never seen the original with Michael Caine, can't really compare the two. It's full of flash, glitz, grungy rock music, and style, but it lacks punch. I wasn't satisfied with Richie's story. We don't get enough background on the guy to fully care about why he died. It just felt kinda there, along with everything else in this movie. I'll give it this much, its slick, but it is rather easy to figure out. It's just cookie-cutter. There isn't a ton of action, but we do get a few dandies. A couple of car chases highlight this film and Stallone and Rourke have a nifty scrap as well, if a little one-sided. Jack Carter's reconciliation storyline with his family should have been much more riveting than it was. I should have seen a ton of emotion from a vulnerable family, but I didn't see a lot of it. Stallone's storyline with Rachel Leigh Cook is one of the most interesting things in this film and I wish we saw more of it. It could have elevated this movie a bit. The characters are so poorly developed. Sly is really good as Jack Carter. He's totally bad-ass and enjoyably tough. The sunglasses were a nice touch. He conveys his emotions perfectly. He has one great emotional scene as well. I wouldn't have messed with this guy. It just sucks that Stallone accepted quite a few projects that didn't deserve a man of his talents. When he has enough to work with, he's proved what he can do. Cook is solid as the daughter, I wish there was more of her. Michael Caine is wasted in a thankless role, but he adds pizazz to a throwaway part. Mitra is poor. Mickey Rourke is clearly trying to cash a quick check. Alan Cumming steals some scenes as a weasel. The ending is completely anticlimactic, void of any emotionFinal Thoughts: This felt otiose to me. I was never really bored, but I wasn't all that entertained either. Action fans will be disappointed by the lack of action, but fellow Stallone fans will love his performance. Check it out on a gloomy day and then forget it even exists. It's that type of film5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Acceptable though inferior remake dealing with a Las Vegas avenger goes home to Seattle to learn his brother's death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Violent film about a hardman named Jack Carter, he is a domineering , dapper angel of vengeance who returns home to investigate a familiar crime and meets sleazy character after another . An acceptable noir film produced by actor Andrew Stevens , Elie Samaha and professionally directed by Stephen Kay (Boogeyman , The last time I committed suicide), though with no originality . An extremely tough movie burdened by cruel murders and seedy characters , based on a novel titled 'Get Carter' by Ted Lewis from 1970 . This brutal , austere crime-thriller focuses a cheerless enforcer Jack Carter (hard-working star Sylvester Stallone) , a tough , amoral gangster who works as a killer in Los Angeles . Passable Sylvester Stallone in the title role , but inferior to Michael Caine (he played Jack Carter in the original) here playing a secondary role as Cliff Brumby (his character was only in one scene in the original cut, but test audiences said they liked him and they transformed the movie to have Caine as the bad guy) . Here Stallone is a hit-man who returns home to investigate his brother's death by some mobsters .As he decides to travel his natal Seattle to investigate who is responsible ; Jack contends enemies , but he stands a head above fellow hoods , but not apart from them . Two-fisted Jack in order to revenge his sibling , vows vengeance and spontaneously meets sleazy characters (bad ass Mickey Rourke and nasty computer magnate Alan Cummings) in the middle of sinister bands war and running afoul into underworld . When his brother dies under mysterious circumstances in a car accident , gangster Jack Carter travels to Seattle to investigate and reunites his widow (Miranda Richardson and niece (Rachael Leigh Cook) and he subsequently meets ominous characters who may have been involved . Carter aware the murder of his brother at the hands of a "gang" opponent led by a mobster . We see as his facade of sophisticated and elegant mob gentleman with exquisite manners , educated pose , and expensive costumes , begins collapsing , leaving see the lascivious, malleability and a cold killer . Carter starts moving in this ambient but all of this ends in a shocking discovery delivered by a compact disc which greatly angers Carter . This triggers a wave of violence that sweeps the the underworld lumpen in Seattle . Carter keeps the things moving along until ending vendetta. The end of the film is like a summary of the entire story for the scenarios that uses austere bleak and cold environment .This interesting film features thrills , well-staged car chases , raw energy , adult subject matter , clunking cruelty surrounding , lots of violence and enlivened by high-powered performances . Plenty of intrigue, atmospheric music ,noisy action and grisly killings until impressive finale vengeance . It is a very violent film , depressing charismatic , magnificently set , but always strong , with a perfect abstraction of a climate of moral misery to game with a colorful photography by magnificent cameraman Mario Fiore . Adequate and moving musical score by Tyler Bates with a rare mixture . The picture obtained moderated Box office , there were plans to do a sequel which never materialized .The main differences between the classic version and this recently made story are the following : The British 1971 bruising film "GET CARTER¨ far superior to remake , is an original movie with abundant nudism , kinky sex , excessively violent and set in Newcastle , a city in northern England portrayed as a cool place , foggy , sordid , rainy , dirty , gray and industrial aspect , shabby environment and ramshackle scenarios , full of sad pubs , buildings almost in ruins , piers of black water and ravaged aspect postindustrial , while this remake 2000 , viewed as an act of sacrilege in Britain , was set in rain-lashed Seattle , a bustling city full of light and luxurious pubs and glamorous nightclubs . GET CARTER 1971 was splendidly performed by Michael Caine with Ian Hendry , John Osborne and Britt Ekland ; there is also a Black Gangster version titled ¨The hit-man¨, a Blaxploitiation movie regularly directed by George Armitage with Bernie Casie , Pam Grier , Roger E Mosley and Paul Gleason .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ho-Hum... nothing new</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I haven't seen the original version of "Get Carter," so be forewarned that this opinion does not reflect that film in any way. Ok, so... I saw the trailer. I was really hoping for a kick-ass flick (which is what the trailer left me with) but of course it wasn't. The problem with the movie is its story. Its script. It isn't the performances, although they don't fit so well. Stallone did well enough with the tough guy persona, Rachel Leigh Cook walked her way through (her "emotional" scene recounting the rape however was strained), Mickey Rourke was... well... Mickey Rourke, and Alan Cummings had some very exceptional moments but his quirkiness which usually brightens up his roles was very out of place in the film. But I digress... as I said, the story just doesn't move well. The "mystery" that Stallone investigates is so muddled that you don't get lost, but you don't care. The twists are stupid and introduce a number of characters who exist for only a scene or two, and they ultimately lead nowhere intriguing. Also, the script refuses to let go of the side story of Stallone's boss and girl back in Vegas until about 3/4 of the way through the film. Neither of those things has any effect whatsoever on the plot of the film other than to make Stallone's character look more like a "bad-ass." The only good thing about the film is that it is very well filmed. Fancy footwork, but no substance... maybe the guys who put the trailer together should have made the flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sylvester Stallone's career took a turn for the worst here with "Get Carter," a dry action film about revenge. Jack Carter returns home to his brother's funeral and decides to solve the mystery surrounding his brother's death. Perhaps the only thing interesting about the film is the friendship made between Jack and his niece, but even this is marred by a plot twist that's handled with such discomfort that it doesn't seem to belong in a movie with the Italian Stallion. Also starring Michael Caine, from the original "Get Carter," and the ever-so-versatile Alan Cumming, I really expected more from this movie. But the film loses its steam after the opening credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"My name is Jack Carter, and you DON'T wanna know me".My God, why didn't I listen to him... Bad. Horrible. Ugly. These are just some of the words I think are too GOOD to apply to this film, the latest load of monkey manure produced by Sylvester Stallone. He plays Jack Carter, a mob heavy (he goes round collecting on debts, although he's not nearly as cool as John Travlota in Get Shorty) in Las Vegas who returns to his Seattle home for his brother's funeral. When he finds out the strange facts about his death he concludes that it was murder, and he sets out to find out exactly what his brother was involved in... I know, I know, it sounds interesting. Too bad Michael Caine did it all before back in '71 with the first Get Carter. Not that I have anything against remakes in general but they shouldn't have taken what's supposed to be the epitome of Cockney gangster films and bastardised it in this fashion. Stallone, as usual, registers a 0.1 on the facial expressions scale and depends on his veritable stalloneness to carry the film. That's a pity when you see the list of great actors that fill out the cast - Miranda Richardson, Rachel Leigh Cook, Jon C. McGinley, Alan Cumming and (gasp) Michael Caine - relegated to plain scenery, supporting characters for Stallone, who needs all the support he can get in this film.I'm not saying the awful acting is the only problem. Stephen Kay's directing is awful too, but he's a veritable newcomer at this. Maybe next time he won't go for weirdo camera angles and strange editing (quick cuts, sudden slo-mo, that kind of thing). The script is worse, and considering David McKenna also wrote the incredible American History X, I make no excuses for him. As for the music, it's positively dire, with some of the worst techno music ever to be used in film. If you can, hunt down the original Get Carter. I hear it's good. As for this pathetic attempt at a gritty thriller... I think it should just get smarter.</fullReview>

The extremely barren "action/fight" scenes are thrown in because they needed something interesting for the trailers (how deceitful for those of us that were fooled - DAMN the advertisers!!). Essentially the moviemakers do this thing where they set up a scene, and it has potential, but nothing happens. It's like you're stuck in a funhouse where instead of mirrors, you're plummeted into a land of long and never-ending conversations. This movie is all talk and no walk.Boring...TO DEATH!

The plot was ok but the best way to describe this movie is just plain boring. There is barely any action (unless you call seeing Stalone's aged and vein-ridden muscles action) and when there was a car chase or fight scene, it was just ... boring. There were a few twists to the story but these were barely enough to keep me watching until the end.

		<fullReview>I found this to be an excellent flick. I haven't had the benefit of seeing the Michael Caine original, but viewed as its own movie, I thoroughly enjoyed Stallone's interpretation of Carter. Solidly acted with a restraint that fit the character. Too many negative reviews I've read all seemed to jump on the "Sly-is-over-rated" bandwagon without giving him credit for the good work he's actually done. With this film and Copland, I think Stallone is better in recent years than he has been in a long time.I think Rachel Cooke played an emotionally difficult role well.I'd rate this an 8/10. Anybody who puts this in the 10 worst movies of the year category (as I've seen) needs to go see Battlefield Earth and Scary Movie again to see that Get Carter doesn't belong anywhere near those cinematic abortions..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stallone may be passe, but this film is pretty good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it is now pretty much official. When one of the last action heroes from the 80's returns to his roots and gives people what they at one time wanted to see, and no one cares, it is perhaps time to take a different route in your career. Stallone is never going to be short on money and fame so instead of trying to inject life into his career by doing starring vehicles like this one, why not take some cameos or some smaller roles in an ensemble cast? Stallone has been pigeon holed and has a caricature about him that he may never get out of. This film has pretty much solidified the fact that he is not the kind of actor and does not contain the kind of persona that can win a modern audience over onto his side.I sometimes wonder if stars in the business read these reviews in forums like this. After all, the imdb is by far the best and is probably the biggest forum on the net when it comes to film. So that would lead you to believe that yes, they do read them. A case in point is one time when I wrote a review critisizing a famous screenwriter for doing a poor job on one of the films that he did. I was quite harsh in doing so and then to my surprise, one day in my mailbox, was an email from this man telling me that the reason he did the said movie was because he was offered a large sum of money and he took it. He admitted that it wasn't his best work but that he worked very dilligently on the script. He then went on the to correct some of my grammatical errors in the review and completely humbled me. I will always be grateful for that email, even though it slammed me, as it was a letter from an idol.The point being, if Stallone ever does read this, then perhaps he should take some advice from one of his loyal fans. Keep working but do it on a smaller level. Everyone goes through lulls in their career, this is yours. But to get out of it, Stallone has to get the public back on his side again. The Rocky and Rambo days are nothing but memoirs now. Do something that is going to make us remember you in a smaller way. Do some Kevin Bacon stuff, or be Bill Paxton and star in a blockbuster, but on a lower level. I am only saying this because I love Stallone. I love what he brings to the table and I think this is a very fine film with a very fine performance. But most people didn't even give it a chance and that is a shame.Stallone plays Jack Carter, a mob hitman. He is actually just a collector but they must be one in the same because he does all the dirty work when one can't seem to pay the bills. Carter has been away from home for many years and he has to go home for his brother's funeral. He ostensibly died in a car accident while drinking, but Carter has suspicions otherwise. This film is about those suspicions and his investigation to find the truth.There are many excellent qualities about the film and one of them is Stallone's performance. Stallone has played characters like this before, he actually reminded me a bit of his Marion Cobretti character, tough but not invincible. Carter is so used to getting what he needs from people by beating it out of them that he uses this technique whenever it serves him. But there are times in the film when he is permeable. He can flex his muscles some of the time to some people but there are others that know he is vulnerable and they can exploit that. Stallone actually gets beat up a few times in the film and he looks good doing it. Stallone's performance in the film is one of the keys to the enjoyment and if critics and the public in general didn't look at Stallone as a caricature from the 80's cartoon like, larger than life characters that he played, they would realize and agree that this is a very layered and three dimensional performance. I'm not saying it is Oscar worthy but there is more there than grunts and groans.What is also very good about the film is how deep it gets into the seedy world of porn. This is one of the central issues as his brother seemed to be mixed up in girls, drugs and porn while his bitter wife was at home wondering if he was going to come home that night. Jack starts to piece the puzzle together and realizes that his brother, while probably not a good husband, was not a criminal and did not deserve to die. His death probably had something to do with the industry that he seemed to be mixed up in. There are a whole slew of suspects that are introduced into the case but my two favourite are the characters Cyrus Paice and Cliff Brumby played by Mickey Rourke and Michael Caine respectively. Cyrus is the lowest denominator in the porn industry but he tells Jack that he is not like he used to be at one time. He is trying to go legit by operating phone sex lines. Carter doesn't believe him and he thinks that there is more to Cyrus than he claims. Mickey Rourke is great at playing these slimy, seedy characters and he shines here as well.Caine is fantastic as the strip club/entrepreneur/porn king in this film. He claims to also be very low on the chain and that even though Carter's brother worked for him, he knew nothing about his death. Caine is deceptively excellent here. He comes across as a boy scout in some scenes and as a ruthless snake in others. Which of those characters is going to surface at which time is anyone's guess.Get Carter is a great film and since no one saw this at the theater, there may be a bit of interest to see it on video. There is plenty of action, great performances and some of the 80's very recognizable faces in here. And not only that, but it is fun to see Stallone be Stallone and kick somebody's ass.7.5 out of 10</fullReview>

Its disappointing to see Caine in such a role because he was so brilliant in the original. SPOILER ALERT Stallone's performances just seem to get worse with age as this one lacks any emotion whatsoever even in the most emotional parts when he has to confront his niece after he has discovered the she was raped. Overall, the movie is just not worth the money. If you really want to see Get Carter just rent the original, its much better and you get to hear all the nifty English accents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trite, overplayed, lecturing nonsense which functions only as a guilty, mindless revenge picture.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stallone and director Stephen T. Kay's re-imaging of the stunning, 1971 British gangster film Get Carter is a monumental mess on mostly all levels; a wavering, distorted and frankly quite annoying piece that renders what was once scuzzy pulp into polished actioner and slow burning film-noir into loud, messy, flashy nonsense. Some will claim it is Kay implementing his own style onto a set text, but in this case it is a set text that did not need re-imagining combined with a style we don't want to see, while the original did not need an update and certainly doesn't need to be fiddled with in order to act as a directorial calling card for someone who would later go onto have a career in making television shows.The 2000 remake of Get Carter begins in its immediacy of establishing some sort of passing of the guard; this by way of briefly playing the old theme tune from the original film over the images before a newer, more contemporary beat kicks in continuing the same basic tone; in a sort of style that sounds like it was spat out of a rave club and landed smack bang on the soundtrack. It's a telling moment; a moment in which the recognition of the old was there, and that this newer version of both the music and film brings everything up to speed for the sake of it. Sylvester Stallone is Jack Carter this time around, a heavy working in Las Vegas more-so London who boards a train in order to travel to Seattle more-so Newcastle in order to attend his brother's funeral. One would hope the distorted, fragmented manner in which Jack's train journey is put across by way of the angles and editing is representative of the character's distorted and wavering emotions as he gradually gets closer to home with the realisation of a sibling's death gradually kicking in, rather than be included for the fact it might, in the maker's eye, 'look cool'.Carter finds an unnatural manner in being able to waltz around kicking guys' heads in; bullying his way into confrontations with people and evading injury during car chases with more sombre, more down to Earth scenes with Doreen (Leigh Cook), his niece and his brother's daughter. The scenes with Doreen enable Carter to act as some sort of would-be fatherly figure as he attempts to take her under his wing; delivering advice as if it were his brother's own, about life and what to do with it and how keeping on the straight and narrow is important ? it's a life lecture from an action lead who, on other occasions when speaking to other characters, tells them: "Sure it does" when told that revenge doesn't work and it's implied that it ought to be something to be chased down.The film sees Carter visit a whole bunch of misfits, from Alan Cumming's techno-boffin Jeremy Kinnear to Mickey Rourke's porn king-come-businessman Cyrus Paice, an individual who distributes a lot of pornography akin to Caine's version, only because it's now 2000 and it's the 21st Century we've moved into here, everything is done by way of computers and disk drives instead of 8mm film stock. I say the 1971 film was "Caine's version", but Michael Caine does actually have a role here, that of Cliff Brumby who you'll remember was tossed over the side of a multi storey car park in the old one by Caine himself. The joke around about the time of the release of this, I'm sure, must've been that Caine is playing the character he tossed away over the side in the original; while in playing a part in the ill-advised remake of Get Carter, thus has now tossed his own career over the side. Fortunatley, this didn't have the ill guided effect on his career it might've done.Snide jokes aside, the problem that the remake of Get Carter is a dunderheaded, bits and pieces revenge action thriller starring someone whom seems to gradually get less and less interested as the film progresses is just half the issue. It's additionally just too all over the place to get involved in and too wavy in whether it wants to pay a lot of attention the the '71 version or not. Whilst the film attempts to get some sort of dramatic flow to proceedings going, there'll be a scene straight out of the original that'll disrupt its course and make you go to yourself: "Oh yeah, it's that part." or "Oh look, this is how they're re-imagining this bit." which is so distracting and so annoying, completely destroying any sort of dramatic weight the film might have been carrying up to the respective point.Running on colourful visuals and really lacking that distinct aura of menace the original certainly carried, 2000's Get Carter is rather a gross misfire. Its want to balance a morality tale with wanting to be faithful and unfaithful in equal measure to the original doesn't sit, while the meek level of substance by way of Stallone life-lectures twinned with the fact what it is that he does is on display just comes across as sanctimonious and stupid ? if there was ever a point in which this remake really needed to borrow from the '71 version, then it was with the ending and Carter's overall fate. If director Kay has translated anything, it's that he's translated a once unhinged, crime fuelled revenge tale into an unengaging and soppy series of grumbles, gunshots and girls that does absolutely nothing for its audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I kept waiting for this movie to stink...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...but it never did! It's actually good. Some very good acting, some very good, well-developed characters and a plot that you actually get involved in and care about. At first, it keeps looking like the kind of movie that's going to beat you over the head with every simplistic character motivation or plot point, but it doesn't. It actually leaves a lot unexplained, to great affect. Even the third act, in which many movies, even good ones, fall completely to pieces, is solid here. The 4.6 rating is really not fair, and is more about how much some people just DESPISE Stallone and anything he does, no matter what. I generally hate about 80% of what Stallone puts out, but when I like him, I like him a lot. And in this movie, he's good. Mickey Rourke is good (starts out strong but gets a little two dimensional as the movie develops, but that's OK, he's still fascinating to watch). John C. McGinley is John C. McGinley-good. Rachel Leigh Cook is very good, and actually great and very moving in one scene in particular. It's really not a bad movie at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A excellent movie in it's own right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just watched this movie for the first time (probably due to the bad reviews). After the past few years of movie production, it's a pleasure to be entertained by a good story, talented acting, inventive direction, cool music and beautiful cinematography (plus some of the best car chases to come out of Hollywood for decades).Fair enough, "it's a remake". But of a film that (this is from a Brit.) is now somewhat dated, and very British. In it's own right this modernest American version is really top class.Stallone is real suited to the character. Maybe he appears shallow. Maybe he looks uninterested. Maybe he looks a little past it. Maybe he's just playing on his muscle-man image......But that IS Jack Carter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stallone hasn't had it easy. As soon as the eighties ended he was pretty much an obsolete joke, the occasional decent film (Cliffhanger, Copland) hasn't changed that one bit. Here he is in a remake of the British Caine classic I've never seen, trying to be both a cool mofo and an involving character at the same time; neither is a success. The entire film has this skizo vibe going, jumping from attempts at introspective thoughtful dialogue, to moody scenes of rainy imagery (tone poems in a Stallone action-thriller for crying out loud), and then to Stallone suddenly being the smirking one-liner spewing action star... it's confusing, just like the direction by Stephen Kay. Kay's intentions are obvious right from the get go, he wants to really funk everything up, Aronofsky style. He wants to do a very expressionistic film where the style is guided by the leads inner turmoil. But it doesn't work. Not that some it doesn't look smashing, of course it does, there's neat stuff here and there (Jerry Greenberg of French Connection fame edited it), but it never ever gels, either it's just a distracting nuisance, or when it works, a minor diamond in a turd sea.The character of Carter as played by an action star going all soft and mushy and non-violent is an interesting idea I guess, but they don't ever follow through on it, instead they just sort of play around with the idea until they are really afraid the core audience has left... and then they throw in an unmotivated action scene of some sort. None of the parts does ever become satisfying in their own right. The acting isn't bad, Miranda Richardson, Michael Caine, Alan Cumming, John C McGinley and the likes pop up and does their thing, it's professional work. There's some cool lines here and there (the coolest ones are definitely from the original, I could tell even though I've never seen it), but mostly the dialogue is weak and doesn't have much point except to pad out the running time and deliver exposition. One or two punch ups aren't all bad (a neat one set in an elevator to muzak was kinda fun), but the car chases are about as exciting a three week old candy bar you found on the floor.There's some unintentional laughs, mostly when "Sly" is trying to deliver a corny/bad line with the deepest seriousness, I kinda enjoyed those, and it wasn't ever really boring (unlike a travesty like Collateral Damage for instance), that's certainly a big plus, but when all is said and done, this is not a good film by any definition of the word.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicely crafted action flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers contained here:Setting the expectation is almost everything. I did not expect much in terms of good crafting when I first saw this film, and I was pleasantly surprised. The acting is truly enjoyable. Sly does well as the normally strong silent type who slips out some emotion. Rachael Leigh Cook does a great job with her character. Alan Cumming as usual is fun to watch. This could almost be billed as a comeback for Mickey Rourke. Michael Caine's role was lacking I felt - too bad his character was not built up more to substantiate his casting, other than the fact he was in the original. John C, McGinley just about stole the film. He's a riot to watch in a role like this one. It would have been nice to see Rhona Mitra as Audrey instead of Geraldine. There were some deleted scenes that would have added a bit more depth to the film, and I would have really enjoyed more Les Fletcher, even if it was only on the phone - amusing Tom Sizemore voice-overs. I normally dislike the kind of music used in the movie but the work by Tyler Bates and Jellybean Benitez won me over and I got the soundtrack and the score and still did not get everything used in the movie.So these are all good elements, shot well with creative cinematography and clever editing (nice use of flash-frames). But why did the movie not do well? It's pretty obvious - the plot holes are worse than Brumby's back at the end of the movie. But for me scenes with Sly and McGinley like the ones in the beginning of the film and the hotel elevator are great. Rachael Leigh Cook shows her ability by making you want to forget her at the beginning of the film and by the end you can feel for her character. Sly does what he does best and is menacing but looking good all the while, and shows some emotional range that was hard to pull off with the character he was playing but he does it nicely. There are more as well, and the sum of the good scenes is a greater total than the issues.So if you can get over the shortcomings, and you like action flicks, I think you will really enjoy this movie. I know I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a big film, and in not too bad shape</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is an established fact that Mike Hodges' original Get Carter, released in 1970, is a classic. Hard edged, tough talking and down beat. But that was 1970. How can Hollywood studios expect teenagers from Idaho to watch a 32 year old film? Simple, re-make it. And, you have to admit, this one had its best intentions at heart. It keeps the original storyline, a hard man heads back to his home town to piece together why his brother died, and gives in a year 2000 spin. Stallone looks as though he needs to have a sit down for most of the film, the years have taken their toll, however, that is the whole point. Jack Carter is a man who has spent his life cracking heads. He is over his head in the situation he has landed himself in, and Stallone, I think, copes amicably. Sure, he's no Caine, but he drives the story forward. Updating the story too has its good points. Switching the sleazy 8mm smokers to dot com porn is a good touch, as it reversing the Kinnear/Paice roles, I think this gives the film a certain gravitas. Sure, it ain't Get Carter circa 1970, but, you've got to admit, it sure passes 2 hours of your life with a minimal amount of pain....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far Sylvester Stallone's best movie. This movie got trashes by critics &amp; especially movie fans because Stallone wasn't shooting everyone in sight...he was acting instead! Oh no, acting...how could he. But seriously, Sly gives a very humane side here, which is one of the reasons why the film holds together so well. This is a remake of a Michael Caine movie, who appears in this version as well. When Jack Carter(Stallone)'s brother is murdered, he goes to the funeral &amp; decides to look into the mysterious surroundings. What he finds is a plot of twists &amp; turns &amp; finds so many people are involved. If you are a Sly or just a movie fan, definitely check this movie out! I gave it 9 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

Maybe they watched the 1970s version on accident. Stallone should be able to find much better scripts than this, and as we saw with DRIVEN he shouldn't try to write them himself.

		<fullReview>This is now takes the top spot as the worst movie I have ever seen, surpassing Johny Pneumonic and Wild Wild West. Good god is this movie bad. Usually, I guess I should say sometimes, in a Stallone movie there is a captivating beginning that sparks some sort of interest through an action scene or something but this movie he's pounding on this guy tied up in a chair ranting about his brother. The next thing you know he's on a plane and that's it they start displaying the actors and the intro music comes on. The guy in the chair we never see again in the movie, there are people that pop in and out of this movie with no link to the plot whatsoever. I think the director realized how terrible this movie was and just tried different things just for the hell of it, like this one scene all of a sudden he slowly turns the camera upside down and I'm like why?? One seen it's at a 90 degree angle. Was I supposed to go "man that was cool". Whatever. Actually I think that this was a ploy to put the final nail in Stallone's career. One liners were terrible, no continuity. I'm not even big into special effects, I like a good story, plot etc., but if you're not going to have that especially with Stallone, blow something up or have some special effects or something. This movie had none of that. If you watch this movie you are going to really have to have discipline to watch it in it's entirety.</fullReview>

The movie doesn't stand up to a moment's scrutiny. And I'd rather watch Sly, Michael Caine, Mickey Rourke, and Miranda Richardson have lunch than watch this.

		<fullReview>I had heard this movie was panned by many critics, but I thought this was a decent effort, and a very good job by Stallone.He plays, what initially looks like a one-dimensional character, and actually portrays him as a very tough guy, living in a very tough world, but with an intelligent, decent, almost gentle side. Stallone is rightly criticized for playing in some laughably bad movies (Cobra), but the guy has some acting chops. This is a very good acting performance by Stallone. He plays a fairly stoic character, but he brings an underlying gentleness that works well with the other characters, especially his young niece.The look and feel of the movie is excellent. The rainy, seamy side of Seattle is portrayed very well. The action is good, and some of the Director's tricks (slow-motion, fast-motion) actually works quite well.Not an award winner by any means, but a decent, entertaining movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I get the feeling this movie is milder than Michael Caine's original Get Carter. Still, this movie isn't too bad. Quite fun to watch actually. Rachel Leigh Cook is funky in this movie. (spoilers!!!!)It does take awhile to figure out that Cook was raped in the movie. And her father got killed for it. More of a mystery than anything with alot of action in it. Stallone's best movie in a long time. Mickey Rourke's best movie perhaps since 9 1/2 weeks. He's had some stupid movie's in the past and this one may erase some of them. If only he can get his head out of his butt long enough. Half the movies he's been in are movie's you wouldn't be caught dead in. Is Gretchen Mol in this? I think she is. Think I'll look, she's not listed in the character list at the end. She's like the supposed lover of Carter and Carter's boss. Hardly made much of it and it woulda just as been easy to cut the story out of the movie.The DVD is quite good. Has both the 1971 Carter and the 2000 one. And several deleted scene's including a less effective original ending. (in my opinion) The camera shots were marvelous in this movie as well as some of the artsy fun the director had. (dvd also includes a directors commentary) Definatly a must rent. (people who want a quality drama stay clear. ;) 6/10</fullReview>

I, on the other hand, did not see the original - and thought this movie really catches your eye, and is worth a watch. Great performances by Stallone, Rourke, and Cumming.But it seems to be missing a few aspects which downgrade it to around a 2-star rating. Nevertheless, if you're looking for a movie that's rough around the edges, Get Carter will fit the ticket. Just don't get lost in the glitsy, and sometimes annoying, camerawork.</fullReview>

And even if you have seen the 1971 original, not everyone can remember all the details - at least I couldn't. (I think there is just about two or three movies about Jesus, and nobody cares about the remakes). Stallone is out to take vengance on the murderers of his brother, a decent barman working to support his family. The story takes place in seattle, and as you can imagine, there are a couple of shootings, car chases and so on. But that's not the movie. The movie is the fight from a bad guy against the bad guys to get justice for someone who didn't do anything wrong. The movie has an extraordinary visual quality, the titles and the music are worth seeing and hearing this movie. And one very seldom quality at the end: This movie is not to long.

Carter goes up against some tough resistance in collecting info on his brother and his death. Carter's niece(Rachel Leigh Cook)slowly warms up to her estranged Uncle. Mickey Rourke is one bad ass rival and Michael Caine is not a total dormant threat. The scenes that Stallone shares with Rourke are explosive, how could they not be.

Adding overtly sentimental 'family' scenes to a film that was supposed to be gritty and unpleasant just shows how the American film market is saturated with homogenised, heavily-censored twaddle.I'm so angry after watching this pile of steaming dog diarrhoea that I can barely string together a coherent thought that doesn't need to be expressed purely as a scream of rage and frustration.Anyone who thinks the remake is better than the original should be shot. I normally tolerate others' opinions, but as far as this film goes I'm as militant as an Islamic fundamentalist terrorist. One of the worst films I've seen in my life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually probably Stallone's best in a long while</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsStallone's remake of the 1971 classic of the same title finally arrives over on British shores.Only it arrives straight to video.This probably isn't very surprising anyway.The Michael Caine (who also appears here,albeit not in the title role again!) original is seen as an untouchable classic by our movie-going public,and an American re-make would probably be interpreted as the ultimate kick-in-the-teeth.But for those not bothered about cultural rivalry or who weren't alive when the original was released,this really isn't that bad a film.It has a really involving camera style and the mystery of Stallone's brothers death is intriguing.There are some interesting characters,with Caine as a mysterious promoter type,Mickey Rourke as an old rival of Stallone's and Miranda Richardson as his deceased brother's wife.This is sadly though,however,a real case of style over substance,all of these things are really well thought out but for some weird reason,they don't really blend that well together.Still,considering Stallone's recent turkeys,this is quite likely his best in a long while and really not a bad effort.***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average remake that wasn't as terrible as I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked this movie, I know, I'm surprised too because the reviews were not too kind. But its sort of stuck with me over the last couple of days.Sylvester Stallone takes over the role Michael Caine played in the original 1971 British version as Jack Carter, a shiny suit wearing debt collector from Las Vegas who returns to Seattle for his estranged brother's funeral and is soon investigating the events that led to his death. He's a character I instantly felt sorry for, he's alone, lonely, obviously hates his life and everyone treats him like sh!t.The mood throughout is dark, violent and gritty with some interesting cinematography thrown in; jump cuts, strange angles and colour filters but there's also some good car chases, shoot outs and fight scenes. Stallone gets beat up real bad here by strip club owner Mickey Rourke.As a whole this film is pretty average but Stallone has a couple of moments where he amazes and makes you realize that he can really act when he wants to. He has several scenes with his niece (Rachael Leigh Cook) which are all quite strong but the one on the rooftop where she tells him what happened to her and he reacts is just astounding, probably one of the most powerful moments I've ever seen from Stallone as an actor.Alan Cummings also shines, Michael Caine has a cameo and randomly the soundtrack by (Tyler Bates) is quite decent as I watched this on the treadmill. *Vancouver as Seattle 4/6/16</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>15 Producers. The Poor Director Never Stood A Chance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Continuing my plan to watch every Sly Stallone movie in his filmography in order, I come to his first movie of the new millennium 2000's Get CarterPlot in A Paragraph: Jack Carter (Stallone) a mob enforcer living in Las Vegas, travels back to his hometown of Seattle for his brother's funeral. During this visit, Carter realises that the death of his brother was not accidental, but a murder. With this knowledge, Carter sets out for revenge. This is a strange case, and certainly a missed opportunity!! The movie doesn't seem to flow right, and that's probably due to the fact that there were lots of changes during the production of the movie. Director Stephen Kay clashed with Franchise Pictures, the financier, over the tone of the film. Kay wanted the film to be more of a character driven "anti-revenge" film, while Franchise wanted a more traditional Stallone action picture. Sly who was trying to move away from action pictures agreed with the director, but 15 (yes 15) producers and poor test screenings who complained about the lack of action in a Stallone movie, resulted in lots of footage on the cutting room floor, several reshoots and and two new endings later, it's totally different in tone to what was intended. Michael Caine's character who was also only in one scene in the original cut, but test audiences liked him and they transformed the movie to give Caine a bigger role. It's sad and disappointing that Sly saw this as another character driven movie to follow up 'Copland' with, but it ended up as nothing more than a routine action flick, that is quite forgettable.Most of Miranda Richardson's scenes seem to have been left on the cutting room floor, and John C McGinley simply disappears from the movie despite being great in it. Alan Cumming is fine and Mickey Rourke is an intimidating presence to go against Sly's Jack Carter, Whilst Michael Caine does what Michael Caine does. But it's Rachael Leigh Cook who is brilliant here. The scene between her and Sly on the rooftop and is the best scene in the movie. I actually consider that scene one of the best scenes of Sly's career. It's just a pity the the rest of the movie wasn't filled with such scenes. As a remake it's awful, as a stand alone Stallone move, it's about as watchable as 'Tango &amp; Cash' and 'Cobra' but without the cheese.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Get Carter (2000): Dir: Stephen Kay / Cast: Sylvester Stallone, Mickey Rourke, Rachel Leigh Cook, Michael Caine, Alan Cumming: Heavy advertizing showcases mindless violence and complete idiocy. Forget Carter and find something of worth to watch. Sylvester Stallone plays a bad man named Jack Carter who slaps people around. That in itself must have taken extreme thought from the screenwriter. He is back in town to attend his brother's funeral whose wife wonders why he cares at all. He doesn't buy it as an accident and gets the real deal on a surveillance camera where a disc is passed. Scenes involving Carter's other job are a distraction and only serve for violence. Director Stephen Kay handles the action with fine locations but this is just a bigger budget and more violent version of the 1971 original starring Michael Caine, which likely had a more detailed screenplay. Story is almost entirely smash, boom, bang, pow, blam, yank, ka-boom! Stallone sounds less intelligent with each spoken word. He is there to fight and nothing more. Mickey Rourke plays Stallone's punching bag. Rachel Leigh Cook plays a confused teenager. She must be really confused to agree to be part of this garbage. Cameo by Michael Caine who really should have declined seeing that this is an insult. Forget Carter and leave the theatre with dignity. Score: 2 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that bad remake of classic British crime drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an update of 1971 "Get Carter" one of Michael Caine's finest movies. Michael Caine also appears here playing Cliff Brumby. Sylvester Stallone's movie is as much a remake as it is a re-imagination of the British movie. It goes in another direction. The main hero , his relationship with his family and the ending are all changed . In a way this version misses the point of the original movie .The 70's movie was a story about a bad man doing bad things in a bad world which ended with "who lives by the sword should die from the sword" message. Here we have a more Hollywood conventional movie about tough guy with good heart trying to punish the evil. That's what made the fans of the original angry. I feel that if this movie was made under different title it would receive much better reception.The screenplay keeps intact much of the original plot and quotes. The filmmakers do attempt to manufacture new catchphrases for Carter like "This is going to the next level." There was also more of a relationship between Jack and Doreen . On the bad sides the fate of one of the major characters is unknown and Michael Caine's character is underwritten.The Michael Caine's Jack Carter was ruthless and cold-blooded psychopath with wit and charm. This movie humanizes Carter. Stallone's Jack Carter is just a nice guy with a not-so-nice profession as the mob enforcer. Stallone has an imposing presence and is very OK here , however he keeps switching from "ruthless gangster" to "good uncle" mode which is distracting.Stallone is surrounded by (mostly) a very effective cast. John C. McGinley , Mickey Rourke , Alan Cumming , Michael Caine and Miranda Richardson. Especially McGinley and Rourke are great here and fun to watch. The minor characters are interesting and played really well. Only Rachel Leigh Cook as Doreen is rather dull and yet she has a nice chemistry with Stallone.Director Stephen Kay directs this movie with style , some even argue that it's a matter of style over substance. I don't agree. Stallone teaches family values. We get the sense that Carter is a real person who is hurting and filled with regret about not patching things up with his brother. It's about the search for truth and redemption, and the price all of those involved will pay while finding it.Beautiful photography by Mauro Fiore, dizzying editing (in style of Steven Soderbergh's "The Limey") and camera angles, a pulsating soundtrack by Tyler Bates &amp; Jellybean Benitez creates the mood. "Get Carter" feels like a postmodern noir movie.This is not a typical slambang action film. It's a kind of stylish, noir, toned-down action film like Mel Gibson's "Payback". I would even call it a suspense drama. Of course there are some action scenes here as well ? few fights and nicely done car chase.The low rating (5.1) might give you impression that it is a terrible movie , but believe me it's not . There are many bad , stupid and devoted of any ambition movies here on IMDb that have higher rating than "GC" that is just disgusting ( "XXX" , "Charlie's angels" , "Transformers" series, "Resident evil" series just to name a few). Also, don't believe the critics who say that this is the worst remake ever . I can easily list many remakes that sucked FAR worse, like "Planet of the Apes" , "Psycho" or "The Wicker man".There were plans to do a sequel which never materialized. Too bad , because "GC" does seem to have a potential for nice franchise , unlike "Hangover" , "Saw" or crap like that. "Get Carter" is actually a watchable film. It can't hold a candle to the original , it misses the point of the original , but on it's own it's not THAT bad movie. I give it 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood does not owe Sly Stallone very much. And chances are the feeling is mutual.With his "expendables" franchise, Sly was more or less telling his fans that he has minimal respect for them, that decades of stardom have taught him that filmgoers prefer pyrotechnics and fluff to real drama.And maybe he was right.But this production, coming at that particular stage of his career, is anything but fluff. The script is tight. Ditto the casting, ditto the acting. Sly slowly but surely takes hold of the viewer's focus and retains it, not so much for what he does, but for what his character is "capable" of doing. Big difference.Seen it a few times. It holds up nicely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sly tries dark gritty style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Carter (Sylvester Stallone) is a Las Vegas mob casino collector. He returns to Seattle for his brother Richie's funeral. Jack is suspicious and starts investigating. Richie's wife Gloria (Miranda Richardson) and daughter Doreen (Rachael Leigh Cook) are not close to Jack. Richie ran Cliff Brumby (Michael Caine)'s club. Cliff claims that the mysterious Geraldine (Rhona Mitra) is Richie's mistress. Jack finds bottom feeder Cyrus Paice (Mickey Rourke) now as a local porn king working for wealthy Jeremy Kinnear (Alan Cumming). Meanwhile Jack's boss back in Vegas is looking for him.Sly tries to be interesting and gritty. It's laying down some heavy style with limited success. The plot doesn't really move. There is a little bit of fun with Sly going up against Mickey Rourke. It would be better to give more drive to Jack's mission. It needs something that could raise the stakes like kidnapping Doreen. This needs to have a mission other than just investigating Richie's death. If that's all there is, then he should start breaking fingers and busting heads. It also means that he could drop the case at any time. This is a scatter shoot of villains and random dark stylistic choices.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"My brother died the other night, and now I'm here."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess my disadvantage here is in not seeing the original film. With that in mind, I noticed a darker, though not as expressive Sylvester Stallone parlay his Carter character into a revenge machine out to get the goons who murdered his brother. Unlike John Rambo, who was minding his own business (at least in the first film) when his buttons were pushed, this incarnation is looking for trouble right from the get go. Though he might have had a clever one liner or two, I didn't get any sense of charisma from Jack Carter, and you have to wonder if the problem with the character was with Stallone's interpretation or the director's. So I guess that's why you had all the fancy camera work, slick angles and stylized editing, especially in the second half where it looked like the original picture might have transitioned into something else. I liked John McGinley as Connie-Conna-Wanna-Do-Da-Day, and Mickey Rourke, already beefing up for "The Wrestler". Some decent fight action and car chase stuff here, but you've probably seen it before. But it's not so bad I wouldn't say stay away to anyone other than Michael Caine.</fullReview>

The video editing is not a hit either, a lot of flashbacks and other trite scenes.Shortly, not a recommended movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bad film made worse. Why on earth do that. Michael Caine, who I love, did the original for the money. He was riding the crest of the wave after Ipcress File, etc. Nevertheless, a good actor can't change a bad script, plot or idea. In his early days he was, like most, a mediocre actor with marketable looks, but he got better with age.Sylvester Stallone plays his alter egos, either Rambo or Rocky. Putting him in a bad story, poorly scripted, with worse casting you get Rambo in a suit and a bad movie. Sly never really improved. He endured. Mickey Rourke was was more notable, but he too always plays Mickey.They should have burned the script for Get Carter after the original and put everyone associated with it in a witness relocation program so things like this don't happen again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tough Stallone avenges his brother's killing and softens toward his niece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not compare remakes to their originals, because a basic story can be scripted and even altered in so many different ways. Besides that the techniques of filming and editing change so much over time, and the kinds of characters that are put on the screen change too.I like and respect Stallone as a writer and an actor. This part suits him to a T. He was well cast in the role of a tough enforcer from Las Vegas who travels to Seattle, where his brother has met an untimely end. It was supposedly drunk driving, but Stallone doesn't buy it. He sets out on a quest to find out what really happened and put it right. While doing so, he grows close to his niece, Rachel Leigh Cook, who does a very nice job. This subplot merges into and becomes essential to the main plot nicely.It is pure pleasure to see how Stallone intimidates people who need to be intimidated. The story makes great use of his physicality. He can tear up too.Strong support comes from Mickey Rourke and Michael Caine.Add in some decent car chase scenes and you have a pretty good crime thriller movie with a fair amount of pizazz. I dock it a point for its plot holes and for some awkwardness in the acting here and there. But I think it's definitely better than the 4.8 it gets at present from IMDb voters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get Carter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Las Vegas "fixer" (Sylvester Stallone; those who don't pay their debts when expected are greeted by this enforcer) returns home to Seattle after a considerable absence upon the knowledge of his brother's death. While on its face, the brother seemed to have been drunk behind the wheel and hit a tree, it turns out after some investigation that the crash could have been a ruse to cover up shady activities.A bartender, a porn "businessman" (Mickey O'Rourke; a real sleaze in this film) perhaps hooking girls out of a club he runs, a Harvard-educated computer whiz (Alan Cumming, in a rare straight role; he's a real weasel, always whining and pee-in-his-pants scared), and a pub owner (Michael Caine, who deserved a bit better than this underwhelmingly limited supporting part, considering he was the star of the original this film was inspired by) all factor into the results of Stallone's investigation. Meanwhile, Stallone's Vegas boss wants him back regardless of the investigation into his brother's murder. Gretchen Moll, the boss' mol, had been having an affair with Stallone, while the always-awesome John C. McGinley (making the most of a small role; most couldn't take the scraps he's given and make them a full course meal like John does here) shows up in Seattle to inform Stallone that the boss insists he returns no questions asked. Of course, Stallone isn't about to leave Seattle until those responsible for his demise are brought to justice (his brand of justice, of course). There's always somebody trying to thwart the investigation, and Stallone remains determined to see the course, with lots of car chases (and, especially, crashes), leveled faces from heavy punches landed, and quivering punks about to crap their pants. Personally, despite a lot of flak this remake has endured, I think it isn't too shabby actually. Stallone, when inspired, can deliver a good performance. He could always crack wise and look all muscled in Demolition Man or Tango &amp; Cash (both of which are pleasures I can enjoy all the time), sending up his action star image, but when required, he had the pathos and wherewithal to apply his acting skills when the right role came along. Like something totally critically maligned (and less regarded) such as Eye See You, or even critically lauded by not as popular with the public (Cop Land), Stallone seemed on his A-game. Even the disaster film, Daylight (which I think should be re-evaluated by all of Stallone's fans; I think this is a good one that could find its audience), was an outlet for Stallone to flex his acting muscles. In Get Carter, this part asks him to portray a damaged character with a not-so-glamorous rep. In fact, his brother's wife, played by a rather wasted Miranda Richardson (her caliber of an actress seems miscast in an action thriller), doesn't even want him around while a young Rachel Leigh Cook (you know, I rather like her the more I watch her; some of the teen stuff she wasn't that challenged, but here is a part that is tough, playing such a girl surrounded by corruption and evil) confides in him because there's no one else around to listen. I think the best acting bits are between Stallone and Cook; here, the vulnerable side of the roughly-hewn, stewing, anger-seething Stallone is visible, while Cook can let down her guard and speak openly with him. A CD containing recordings of a drug-induced rape of a minor and a hooker (Rhona Mitra, simply stunning, even as she's glammed down into trampy dresses and make-up) the dead brother was involved in an affair with both could shed light on the false car crash and its purpose. With intense exchanges between O'Rourke and Stallone, which soon lead to fisticuffs (first, O'Rourke gets the better of Stallone, but later the results are reversed), and a shifty Caine who seems to be hiding something (he just has that way about him that can't be trusted) provide some intrigue in the film. I wasn't a fan of the photography (a lot of close proximity, in-your-face shots, and the camera rarely holds still very long) in the film, nor was the editing style much to my liking (I prefer compositions to last past two seconds), but Stallone's star appeal (and charisma), as well as, his sincerity in the developing storyline held my interest. If he cares in the part, it shows. It sure as hell did in Cop Land; I think, while his career was starting to decline as the 90s made its way into the early 2000s, he had some of the best performances since the early days when Rocky announced him as a major star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome back Carter or is it Carter's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** It's when Jack Carter, Sylvester "Sly" Stallone, got the news that his kid brother Richie, Mike Cook, was killed in a drunken car accident he decided to get the first plane out of Las Vages to Seattle and check things out. Being the top head cracker for the Vages Mob Carter used his extraordinary talents of cracking heads as well as breaking bones to uncover the true reasons behind Richie's unfortunate accident. You see Richie being a good church going family man didn't drink and drive and as Carter sees it the drinking that he did that lead to his death was strictly involuntary.Brutal and at times senseless crime revenge movie with Stallone as Jack Carter out to get his brother's killers where he ends up breaking every law in the books including cold blooded murder, in one case in front of about 100 eye witnesses, yet he seems at the same time totally immune with no one in the Seattle Police Department bothering to take the time to arrest him.As we soon find out the reason that Richie was murdered is that his teenage daughter Doreen, Rachael Leigh Cook, was picked by some of mob boss and porn connoisseur Cyrus Paice, Mickey Rourke, boys from a local nightclub and after getting her both drugged and drunk brutally raping her. With Richie having the evidence of Paice's men crime, a secretly recorded DVD, he was kidnapped beaten drenched with cheap booze and driven off the highway to his death on Cyrus orders. Carter determined to avenge Richie's murder then goes to a party thrown by Cyrus and after a brutal beating that Cyrus gave him evened the score by later himself working Cyrus over and blowing his brains out! All that right in front of some dozens of shocked party goers who didn't not only bother to call the police or come to Cyrus' aid, shads of the 1964 Kiddy Genovease murder, but even come forward to identify Carter as Cryus' murderer! ***SPOILERS****But as Carter intended to do in the first place he got the job done by finally finding out who really had ordered his kid brother's murder and as it turned out it wasn't Cyrus at all. But it was the person-the Porno King of Seattle-who had the most to lose if that DVD was made public and in the end in what you would call a Carter VRS Carter confrontation it was Jack Carter, the 2000 version, who prevailed. Besides the awful lighting in the movie where you couldn't at times tell who was who and what was what the most weirdest thing going for "Get Carter" was Stallone's suite paths as well as white shirt &amp; ties. Stallone's clothes were far more indestructible then he, as Jack Carter, was in the movie. They never get dirty or wrinkled or even wet with all the rain there was at the time in Seattle. And even more astounding they never for once needed to be dry leaned or pressed looking in all the scenes that they were in the movie worn by Sylvester "Sly" Stallone as if they just came off the rack! Sylvester "Sly" Stallone's real life brother Frank has a cameo role in the movie as one of the mourners at Richie Carter's funeral.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing fantastic but a nice enough action/thriller flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a good example of why, in my opinion, the official ratings by on Rotten Tomatoes, made by the so called (professional) critics, are generally worthless. Currently this movie has a rating of 12% according to Rotten Tomatoes which, of course, will lead everyone not aware of how crappy their system actually is to believe that the film is utter crap and that is really utter crap.This movie is nothing fantastic. It would even qualify as a B-flick, but it is not really bad. It is a nice enough action/thriller flick to kill an evening with without really getting disappointed. I have not seen the original one so I am not pre-conditioned against this movie which perhaps helps.Sylvester Stallone does a quite acceptable performance in the role of the silent and threatening mob enforcer. He plays as you would expect him to do and if you do not like Stallone, well then there is not much to do about it. Personally I think he has his style and I like it and do not really want him to change it just because some critics find it "lacking".The movie itself and the story is also fairly okay. Again nothing fantastic or particularly innovative but good enough. It has its ups and downs though. Especially in terms of pacing which is a bit uneven. Sure, not everything can be car chases or fist fights but when it slows down it really slows down. Even though it is a gangster/action/thriller movie it is not overly violent. As a matter of fact it is fairly tame in the sense that, as soon as someone actually gets killed this happens off the scene and is left to the viewer's imagination. A bit silly if you ask me but it did not really bother me too much either so.Close to the end the director indulges himself in some very annoying psychedelic flickering scenes, presumably to hide some of the violence in the final fighting between Stallone and the bad guy. That did bother me. I really do not like such epilepsy inducing nonsense. Not that I have epilepsy but it still strains my eyes and really bother me.Anyway, it was a decent enough movie and certainly good enough to get, at least, an average rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>97% less nasty than the Micheal Caine version, which was, face it, about as nasty as they come. And so yes, it lacks the raw feeling of disgust and with it most of the dramatic tension. And, yes, there are some some nonsensical plot moves especially towards the end, unlike the rather spartan, bleak, and more thematically satisfying resolution of the 1971 film.But taken on its own merits, it's a good movie. I'll go one step further: surprisingly good.The styling works. The music works. Stallone works, though he's a little too cuddly perhaps. Rachael Leigh Cook works, her character is just believable enough to hold the movie together. Without that the movie would be throwaway.Highlight of the movie is Micheal Caine lecturing Stallone on how revenge is pointless and Stallone's blunt reply: "no its not". Come on? The original Jack Carter telling this to John Rambo? Worth the price of admission right there!Though I admit you will have to make some allowances especially if you've seen the original:- Too many gratuitous car chases. - Bad guys are ridiculously bad shots, even for an American action film. - Playing Jeremy Kinnear for comic relief leaves the bad guys toothless. - Botches the "Jack Carter is having an affair with his boss's wife/girlfriend" side plot completely.Kudos though for keeping the names intact while moving from the North of England (a train ride from London) to Seattle (an even longer train ride from Las Vegas). That was cute.Kudos also for keeping the pornography angle, but that was also a bit of a problem, since, well, the filmmakers decided they couldn't push the _underage_ angle and without that the main motivating force of the plot evaporates.Check your brain at the door, enjoy the show. It's not a terrible film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some Hollywood remakes of classic Brit flicks work, to a degree (both Michael Caine films, actually) - The Italian Job and even 'Alfie', to my mind - but The Wicker Man and now, here, Get Carter, just don't.Why? Well, to make them different enough and presumably for American audiences, all semblance of what made them originally work flies out the window. Michael Caine was a believable bloke next door who was pushed and forced into taking the law into his own hands, not Rambo dressed as a yuppie who just has to LOOK at people and they cry...Then, they obviously thought 'stick in some British people, to make it more British', which it obviously doesn't. Miranda Richardson tries but poor old (or young) Alan Cumming is always on a lost cause as the techno-geek dot.com millionaire who's as spoilt rotten as the film is.None of the events seem to make sense, lurching from one precipice to the next and when violence (sudden, explosive, often without reason) isn't enough, some of the worst scenes I've ever witnessed, of Stallone attempting to emotionally bond with a young girl called Door-een. Even the way he says her name is haunting me now, after!I'd also forgotten that Mickey Rourke has a part in this - I strongly suspect that he wisely chooses to do the same, now that he's got his reputation and bad luck (&amp; films) behind him. Maybe this shoddy affair was his turning point, his rock bottom?Perhaps the many faults lie with the film trying to follow the original too closely - which is where my aforementioned The Italian Job differs. The only tangible connection with both old and new in those are the Mini's, though purists might argue that the new style BMW owned Mini's in the remake aren't real Mini's etc etc.So, what we have here is a clump of the original story, crudely updated and dumped in a sea of other bits salvaged from other ill-advised ideas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stallone Tries To Relive His Image</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Get Carter is the crime thriller remake of the 1971 film of the same name.It stars Sylvester Stallone in the title role as Jack Carter.It is based on the novel Jack's Return Home by Ted Lewis, which was previously filmed with Michael Caine as the gangster seeking revenge.The movie also features Miranda Richardson, Rachel Leigh Cook, Alan Cumming, Mickey Rourke, and Rhona Mitra. Caine appears in a supporting role.The movie is directed by Stephen Kay.Jack Carter is a ruthless hired killer whose bloody career in Los Angeles has driven a wedge between himself and his family in the Northwest. When he learns that his brother has died, he flies back to Seattle, hoping to pay his respects and reconnect with his relatives. At the funeral, his brother's wife, Gloria,and her daughter, Doreen , are wary of Jack's attempts to reach out to them, but when he learns that his brother's death was no accident, Jack forms an uneasy alliance with Doreen to find the killers and deal out his own brand of justice. The movie apparently banks on Stallone's ability to relive his image as the best physical actor of the 80's but to no avail.He seems not to outlive his monosyllabic tone of speaking ala Rocky Balboa.Also,he cannot recapture the same interest he has provided the audience back in the 80's and bring them back into the modern era.Unfortunately,viewers gets no spark from him and so does the story that lacks tension and suspense.Despite the stylized visuals to add some energy and intensity,the screenplay obviously relies on the formulaic and clichéd plot requirements.Overall,the remake fails to hold a candle to the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solid, Above Average Crime, Gangster Genre Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of the original movie with Sylvester Stallone offer him a character study that allows him to bring out a slightly more complex, refined heavy man. With a fascinating beginning musical score (suggestive of the later music found in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA (2006)) that really grabs the attention with an intelligent, sophisticating but that unfortunately is not followed up with further appealing musical score, this movie has a layered underlying theme and characterization that lifts up this predictable, generic gangster revenge movie to a more original level. The plot is sufficiently convoluted, the action sufficient intermittent to allow character development and relational elements to provide a certain emotional impact. Even Stallone's character is able to stray somewhat from the typical, empty-headed brute. The few weakness in Stallone's character partly the result of the script that isn't as tight as Jason Bourne (Bourne Identity series), there is some luck, perhaps too much, that allows Stallone's character to make it as far as he does, diminishing somewhat how good a muscle man the character really is (the return to his brother's wife's home after taking his niece to dinner). There are a few scenes during car chases that also seem a little too staged, though in this movie, the chases are much better handled than most. The camera work is also somewhat creative with different effects that almost but never quite become pretentious or overused and in most cases used to good effect (especially the upside down car visual, that could have easily turned pretty lame). Overall, though this is a stylish and intelligently and emotionally solid movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a lot more subtle and complex than the bulk of its target audience would ever realize. If you had read the novel it is based upon, the movie is MUCH better, although I still think it takes a lot of undeserved criticism. You have to connect quite of few dots on your own for the plot and story line to stay linear, and I think that is where a lot of Rambo type moviegoers got lost. The cast is very good, but many of them are not utilized to their full potential as far as character development,but overall it is a very solid film. The opening theme music is also fantastic, as is most of the editing. Check it out on ION television!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A toothless remake (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not one of these people that claim their childhood has been raped when a favourite film has been remade by the greedy Hollywood cash machine. I don't cry myself to sleep at the thought of Marky Mark battling apes or Vince Vaughn dressing up as a lady. But the remake of Get Carter is just bizarre. It's like everyone involved has agreed that the original is a fantastic film and then they've decided to ignore or change everything that made it great.However, the film makes numerous attempts to ingratiate itself to fans of the original. The film opens with the wonderful Roy Budd theme tune. But then it all goes wrong. This stylish music suddenly becomes a techno abomination, a supposed sign of modernity that can only have most right-thinking individuals reaching for the nearest sharpened pencil in which to stab their eardrums with.And then there's the title sequence. In a nod to the original we see Jack Carter on a train travelling to his hometown to find out who killed his brother. But although in the original it made sense that Jack would be taking a train ride, here I can't help but wonder why Carter just didn't take a plane. Surely someone who has mob connections and a high income would rather fly to Seattle from Las Vegas. But no, the film wants to pay homage to the original, even though all the time it's urinating on its head.One of the most shocking things about this Get Carter is how toothless it is. The original is a gritty, relentlessly violent tale of retribution. This on the other hand is a limp revenge tale full of self-growth. I really wanted to vomit during the scene where Carter and his niece talk things over and help one another grow as human beings. Yes, mobsters make great self-help gurus and grief counsellors. What's that, you father's dead and you starred in a sleazy bit of porno? Don't worry, Uncie Carter the murderer will make everything better. There, there child.But one of the most unforgivable things is the casting of Alan Cumming. Sure I can never truly hate him as he was Boris in GoldeEye, but every single performance since then has been awful. He's just incapable of being anything other than a cartoon. And while that might be appropriate for X-Men or a Bond movie, it certainly doesn't fit with a supposedly gritty crime thriller. I mean, there's a scene at the end when Carter is going to kill him where he's wearing a bucket hat ? one of the film's main villains looks like Reni out of The Stone Roses. And during the scene at the end he cries like a girl, his voice becoming so high-pitched that he must have had several clipboard clips attached to his testicles. Just shoot him, I begged Stallone. But no, Carter makes this simpering fool get on his knees and then unloads a magazine beyond his head before telling the moron that he's going to give him a second chance. Screw that. Splatter his brains all over the ground.Compare this compassion to the original where Carter kills everyone who gets in his way. All of the people who were complicit in his brother's death are ruthlessly despatched. Plus there's the possibility that his brother's daughter is in fact Carter's daughter, as he was sleeping with his brother's wife. So there are quite a few different levels to the story and there's quite a bit of ambiguity. But here everything is very simple. Doreen is definitely Carter's niece and Carter doesn't have a sexual relationship with his brother's wife. Carter deep down is just a decent guy trying to right a wrong. Yawn.And because the film is far more simplistic, many of the important scenes fall flat. For instance, there's the scene where Carter finds out that his niece was involved in a porno movie. You have jagged editing and then later you see Stallone driving his car as the camera moves upside down (his world has been turned upside down?get it?). But it has zero emotion. Compare this to the original where Carter stumbles upon a porno movie after shagging some broad. At first he enjoys it, but then when he sees that Doreen is involved, a girl who might be his daughter, his enjoyment turns to tears. You very briefly see a glimpse of humanity. But then he explodes in rage and you know everything is going to end badly.But the remake doesn't end badly for the characters. Apparently revenge isn't a messy game. In fact, it makes everything okay. And then once it's done, everyone can get on with their lives. We even see Stallone drive off into the sunset. It's the complete antithesis of the Caine film.Speaking of Caine, he turns up as the bad guy in this film. But I don't know whether his taking part in this movie is an endorsement or he's having a laugh. I'd like to think he's trying to show everyone how inferior this movie is, but in reality it was probably just an easy paycheque. But seeing Stallone and Caine together reminds you of how inferior Sly is. Caine's Carter was a tough everyman, a bloke who had a mentality of a cobra. Stallone's Carter, though, is a beefy wimp, an idiot in a shiny suit who speaks in catchphrases. A couple times he tells people he's taking things to the next level. But unfortunately for Sly his film never gets off the ground.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing to brag about. Once Stallone, always Stallone. Or if your prefer once Rambo, always Rambo. Or even better once Rocky, always Rocky. So here the Rambo from the subtropical jungle has landed in some suburban asphalt jungle, the Rocky of the boxing ring has fallen down to the crime ring of some underrated but self-overrating gang of gangsters, what else could they be anyway. You have the fights your are looking for. You have the car chases you are expecting. You have the fake eroticism you are seeking. But you have little less. One gangster gets killed by some others because he gets too nosy or greedy. His brother cleans up the plate out of pure spite and vengeance. Is it a film defending the family? Maybe, maybe not, because if the family were that kind of hectic, rootless and unethical life then I would convert myself to pure animal mating, it might even be nicer and go smoother. But as a bloody entertainment on a late Saturday night if you have nothing more interesting to do, that's fine, that will do.

		<shortDescription>Get Over It!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gavin Greaves' review from five years ago (see the main page) sums up the problems with the remake of the great Get Carter, a Sylvester Stallone vehicle that features Sly in some of the best clothing I've ever seen. It's a sloppy, disconnected mess of a movie that lurches along through sheets of rain, wet, and dark in Seattle--and never really tells the original's story very well.Yet, I have a better opinion of GC than I should. It may be the really good poster art that caught my attention (pathetic reason, isn't it?) or my liking of the original (I kept hoping for the remake to at least pull up alongside the grit and nastiness of the 1971 flick; it didn't even come close).I finally realized why, sitting there chatting about the movie with my brother-in-law. He got a big charge out of Mickey Rourke beating the stuffing out of Sly. I didn't. Rourke is such a wad of greasy hair and weirdness that, except for the cameo he had in The Pledge, I can't think of any time I've liked him since Diner or Body Heat. I kept waiting for Rocky Balboa to come off the ropes and kill the hump.It's Rocky (and maybe the first Rambo) that made me root for Get Carter to be better than it was.I was disappointed as Hell, not only in the movie, but that Sly's tailor didn't get top billing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a Sylvester Stallone fan, the UK, and Glasgow in particular, is a bad place to live. 'Get Carter' was never released in British cinemas (as far as I know), 'Driven' did not play in any of the Glaswegian cinemas, and 'D-Tox' could be seen in Glasgow for one entire week! Needless to say that I was not able to visit my local cinema during the 7 days the latter was playing.I bought the DVD of 'Get Carter' in Holland last week, since the British DVD release date still lies 2 months ahead of us. Of course I had high expectations of this film since it was the first new Stallone film I had seen since 'Cop Land' but I should have known better. Sometimes the critics are right!Although the film really tries to be 'stylish', with its strange camera and editing effects, it cannot hide the fact that we do not really care about what is happening. At least the film is fairly short, which does not make it too boring, but this Stallone vehicle is offensively mediocre!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brooding, slow, small-time crime drama about a Las Vegas mob enforcer (Stallone) who returns to his hometown to avenge the death of his brother. This remake of the 1971 original by the same name never gives its audience a reason to care. The plotline is so small and void of context that the motivation behind the characters and their actions is too vague to grasp. Caine (who starred in the original), Rourke, and Cumming are given embarrassingly slight roles that mock their true acting abilities. Possibly the most aimless and ineffective part of the film is director Kay's insistence on using cheap visual gimmickry to sell his version as modern and Stallone as "cool." Only bright spots are underrated Cook, Richardson, and McGinley is underused roles.</fullReview>

I loved the fact that the 1971 version was very true to life in that the rain never ceases and Carter bought it on a dreary day on the outskirts of an offshore coaltip.People are always 'updating things for the new millennium' when they really don't need to be touched, and the fact remains for me that the original version wins hands down on all scores. Quite how Caine agreed to be involved in this is beyond me, and only serves to prove his best work is (mainly) far behind him.So, 5/10 I'm afraid from me, I really can't believe that many of the reviewers havent seen the original - but that would probably explain the high average rating - despite it all a good storyline never dies...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did we really need that remake?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So who had the idea that one of the greatest British cult films could or should be remade? Who felt that an old Sylvester Stallone is better in this role than a young Michael Caine? And who felt that rainy Seattle of the 00's matches rainy Newcastle-upon-Tyne of the 70's?This is nothing more than a slightly technically upgraded version of the story of Jack Carter, who travels north to find out why his brother, whom he hadn't seen in years died drunk in a car accident, despite the fact that he never drank and drove.Stallone's Carter is a more bodily, more physical type than the slick, almost arrogant Carter played by Michael Caine. He seems also more tired, more resigned and much more emotional: he even weeps at one point.The new version seriously shifts its focus: there is no phone sex scene, no hard men's talk, instead there is considerably more uncle-niece bonding. Rachael Leigh Cook does a good job as a much more personified Dolores; she adds a family angle to what was a lone man's man film; I haven't decided yet whether I find that good or bad.Mickey Rourke as porn king Paice is in keeping with the roles Rourke usually plays, but no match at all for Ian Hendry, who played the original Paice. Michael Caine also appears in the new version, but his character here is, if anything, just predictable and a major disappointment.(Minor spoiler in the following paragraph) All in all, it's a mediocre attempt at remaking a 1970s cult classic and at the same time making it family-friendly by throwing in an uncle-niece angle and by changing the ending. Too bad that with this ending the film's title no longer makes any sense.Recommended only if you want to see Sylvester Stallone weep or if you're a diehard fan of the original and want to compare the two. It's not particularly bad, it's just not particularly good either. It's mostly pointless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this as a cheap thrill with a guy friend. We braced ourselves for the worst, and actually had a backup video in case we needed to abort mid-film.That was not necessary. It did take a while to warm up to the movie, but it did invest a good half hour of bloodless plot development after the opening "rough-him-up" scene.Probably the most interesting feature of the film, beyond excellent cinematography, ironic B movie dialog, and fine supporting acting, is Stalone. You are never comfortable with his character, which I think is what makes the movie as successful as it is.He affects the persona, posture, and dress of a weightlifter impersonating an investment banker. The expensive, clean, and tailored clothing looks awkward, overcompensating, and almost clownish as Stalone stumbles and rumbles through his opposition. Same goes for his tough guy lines -- "you don't want to know me" or "I'm going to take it to the next level". Meanwhile, we can tell his character is not exactly enamored with how he turned out in life, but lacks the equipment to affect a change; the best he can do is express who he isn't by beating the crap out of "scum" who are actually colleagues in his line of work.At the end, we are treated to Stalone, dispensed with his tie and goatee, big dumb grin on his face, as his character imagines that he has undergone a catharsis. But accessories and facial hair do not make or unmake the man, and all things told he looks much the same. And his character has plans for more renegade justice while running from the law who will presumably be following up on the various brawls and killings he was entangled in.Certainly no match for Rocky, but I think Stalone has the last laugh with the critics on this one if they are taking it so seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lead role miscast, but otherwise enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whoever told Sylvester Stallone he would be right for this part needs some serious counselling.Now perhaps the movie was a pet project for Syl, maybe that is why he insisted in being the lead character.Stallone plays Jack Carter, a Vegas heavy man who returns home for the funeral of his brother only to find that he wasn't as lilly white as he thought he was. He descends into a world of violence, sex and drugs to uncover the truth about his brother and why he died.Stylistically Get Carter looks and feels great - it employs great and unique use of split screen to establish mood. The score by Tyler Bates (his first major film by the looks) works well with the visuals, cementing it in the present while throwing out soft hints towards its 1971 predecessor.Speaking of the 1971 original, I must be honest and say I haven't seen it yet (although it is next on my list for viewing) - so I can't really give you an comparisons between them.What I can say is that Stallone is woefully miscast as Carter. He can handle the action scenes pretty well, but give him more than one line in a row to speak and it gets quite silly. Witness the excruciating scene on the hotel roof with his niece.Michael Caine makes a guest appearance as the boss of Carters slain brother - where he worked as a bartender. He should have been used more, for in every scene he is in, he steals it unashamedly.I did enjoy Rachel Leigh Cook's performance as Carters neice. She played it very understated, not feeling the need to overact or play up the 'fatherless daughter' role too much.Overall I enjoyed the movie but felt that with a touch more attention to casting it would have been better. I did get lost now and again with the twists and turns (the second bartender and his sideline business seemed to come from nowhere, and the Mickey Rourke character seems to get away scot free) but never felt totally at sea.A good movie if you are in the mood for a bit of action.7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GET CARTER gets off to a somewhat weak start, but begins to pick up once Sly returns to Seattle, and really gets going once his hunt for his brother's murderer gets underway. Stallone turns in a nice subtle performance and manages a good deal of restraint in (what I think is) his best action film since RAMBO III. I also liked how Rachel Leigh Cook's character was allowed some good character development. Mickey Rourke is the usual bad ass, and Michael Caine has a small role as the owner of a night club Sly suspects is one of the people involved with his brother's death. The rainy locales in Seattle add a grim feel to the movie, with two car chases, the second being the best. Alan Cumming provides some good, not-too-obtrusive comic relief in an otherwise serious film. Lots of style, and a cool jazzy-ish score by Tyler Bates. I've never seen the original, so I don't know how this one stands in comparison, but as it's own film, I liked it.</fullReview>

A friend of mine recommended the movie to me and said it was not all that bad. I rented the movie and wish I got a refund. "Get Carter" is another one of Sly Stallone's recent bad movies. I could not believe the man who starred in and wrote Rocky would star in this kind of movie. "Get Carter" is slow moving and boring. The story is basically non existant. Also some good actors (Michael Caine,Alan Cummings) are terribly wasted in this film. The part where Alan Cummings starts screaming and crying "please don't kill me Mr. Carter please" is either bad acting by a good actor or it was meant to be funny but it came off bad. If you want to see a good, recent Sly Stallone movie rent "Assasins" or "Copland" not this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surprisingly, Get Carter has great, totally convincing acting (even from Stallone), an open-ended plot, and a couple really great scenes. But of the 102 minutes, for about 60-75 minutes...nothing happens.Most of the film has you waiting for the next scene to happen, but Kay's directing is so...barren, that a big chunk of Get Carter just has Stallone walking around a city to find out what happened to his deceased brother, so he can get revenge, but the plot has no twists (which would have been easy to implement to the plot), not nearly enough action scenes, so basically, Get Carter doesn't know what ot wants to be, either an adrenaline-induced tale of revenge, or drama about a bad-turned-good gangster who only wants to redeem himself of his nasty career and do something good.In short: the acting is superb, some scenes are totally convincing, the plot is open-ended...but the cons far outweigh the pros, turning a potential blockbuster into crud. Even die-hard Stallone and Caine fans will be sorely disappointed, especially by the blink-and-you've-missed-it ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though Stallone made a number of bad career choices in his life, he never played in a really bad film... until now. Get Carter fails mainly because of the director. He tries to achieve too much in this film: interesting plot, mysterious and dark atmosphere plus modern cinematography (Hong Kong style with hints of 'The Matrix'). First off, the script is plain terrible, because the characters are badly defined and all those events that are supposed to be important or tragic, have no impact to the audience. Think of John Woo films' type of melodrama, with even more shallowness. Also even those modern shots are a little far fetched, since you can't really tell what's going on in the action sequences. I would say that Stallone's performance is bad (his crying scene is absolutely unconvincing) but look who's also starring in this movie: Michael Caine. Did you feel that a great actor was on this film? I don't believe so...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoiler Alert*Admittedly, Sylvester Stallone has made some bad movies (Most of his nineties actioners). However, Get Carter is Stallone's best movie in a while. The movie is a low body count tough guy movie, with outstanding performances by just about everyone. Stallone is convincing as Jack Carter financial adjuster. You gotta problem Big Jack will take care of it(actually Stallone is only 5-10). Jack's brother Ritchie gets killed and now Jack is going to investigate. At this point you might get the sense of "here we go again" another movie in which Stallone is the unflappable tough guy who is probably gonna kill everyone in his path, and walk away without batting an eye. The concept of the story has been told thousands of times before, and this movie does have its moments that are cliched and completely by the book. These scenes are boring. This movie has been made very thoughtfully. Stallone's character changes, and learns about himself and the family that he really has never known. Because when he comes back home to investigate, for the first time in his life he takes time to care about his family. His place in the family is Uncle Jack. One of this movies assets is the relationship Jack develops with his niece throughout the movie. The relationships and everything are fine, but most people are gonna want to see this movie for the action. If you are looking for a massacre you'll be disappointed. The movie does not handle death cheaply. This movie focuses more on the dialogue. This doesn't mean the movie isn't exciting. The characters in this movie fear violence. Stallone is intimidating in this movie. He has some great lines "Hello my name is Jack Carter and you don't want to know me". The fight with Mickey Rourke in the end is great. It is refreshing to see an action movie with a conscience. An 8 out of 10. Action fans will love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An inoffensive performance from Stallone, but watching the original trailer for the Michael Caine version reminds me just how evil the original character of Jack Carter is. Stallone just doesn't seem as driven as Caine was in the original, and it seems difficult to judge quite why such an affable man has come back with a revenge wish.</fullReview>

His one liners, which were meant to intimidate the bad guys, were pathetic but they were somehow effective.

		<fullReview>They might as well have called this Payback II: similar storyline, directing, mood, etc. Of course this movie stars a typically stoic Stallone rather than a charmingly downtrodden Gibson, which makes for an inferior show off the bat. Sly does hold his own, however, as the bad guy gone good in this "you-hurt-my-family-now-you-must-pay" (ie. Steven Segal-esque) action thriller. While this movie won't take home any awards (or much $) and doesn't break any new ground (see: increasingly tiring and overused artsy cinematography) , its mean attitude and hard-nosed action scenes make for definite fun. Extra points for anything with Rachel Leigh Cook.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I set out to see this film I figured that while I am not a Stallone fan, it at least it had Miranda Richardson and Alan Cumming in it to make it interesting. What I left the theatre with( besides a peculiar feeling of numbness in my brain) was anger that Miranda Richardson had wasted her considerable talents on this film. What part she had to speak of appeared to have been seriously butchered by the director who must have feared her performance had been too good and would have made the other actors' performances seem even more abysmal than they really are. With exception of course to Alan Cumming who can always be relied upon to liven up any scene in a film. However, his costumes in this film were pretty rank but nothing compared to the over all composition( term used loosely) of the film. Let's hope Ms. Richardson and Mr. Cumming never feel compelled to prostitute themselves to this kind of film ever again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Caine played in the Original 1971 version of Get Carter. He's back in this one as an aging mobster. Nice touch. Stallone is his old glare and grunt self in a very loose tale of revenge. Very talented Miranda Richardson who thrilled us all in The Crying Game is underutilized in this confusing tale. The little mental flashes Stallone's Carter experiences are confusing and the final fight scene between him and tough hood, Strong makes little sense. The theme of this film is revenge but the writing is incredibly flawed. Too bad. It could have been a classic. Still, it was nice to see the Sly back in his old action mode. I still loved the scene in Tango and Cash where Kurt Russell asks him, "Who do you think you are? Rambo?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to "Get" Reason for "Carter" Update</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sylvester Stallone's "Get Carter" is an ill-conceived update of the 1971 original which starred Michael Caine as the revenge-seeking title character. Yet, while the 2000 version is pointless, it is highly watchable, due to the uniformly good acting throughout.The novelty of the original "Carter" was that the "hero" was a thoroughly ruthless and cold-blooded psychopath -- a character who would be thoroughly unpleasant if not for his wit and cool efficiency. (He was like a less erudite Hannibal Lecter.) The current film, though, humanizes Jack Carter, which is to miss the point. Stallone's mob enforcer is just a nice guy with a not-so-nice profession. Fortunately, the character rehabilitation makes for one of Stallone's most likeable performances in recent memory (if one actually remembers much of "Judge Dredd" or "The Specialist"). He has a warm rapport with Rachael Leigh Cook, who plays Carter's niece, Doreen. While Stallone naturally is at home in the action pieces, the best scenes in the film are Stallone and Cook's quiet moments together spent talking.Whereas Carter has undergone a personality change, the screenplay keeps intact much of the original plot and quotes. This, too, is a major misstep because the actors inhabiting the characters placed around Carter have a different feel than those of the original. One of Carter's adversaries, Cyrus, was a weak, shifty character in the original. Now, he is a muscular, vibrant (non-straight-to-video) Mickey Rourke. Carter's quip as he sizes up Brumby is brought back, but with hulking Stallone delivering it to a decidedly less-imposing Michael Caine, it seems ridiculous. (The filmmakers do attempt to manufacture new catchphrases for Carter ("This is going to the next level."), but they shouldn't have.) Once again, though, a major misstep makes for a pleasant surprise. The most memorable character in the original was Carter because the other characters were simply there for Carter to lay into and dispose. In the new version, memorable characterizations abound from Rourke, Caine, John C. McGinley, and Alan Cumming.Stephen T. Kay, if memory serves correctly, previously directed the equally misguided update of the "Mod Squad," which had nothing to recommend it. With "Carter," however, he has made a welcome mistake -- a Stallone film redeemed by its acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sly Stallone has been on a wrong slide lately with his choice of projects lately. Despite his DeNiro-like turn in "Copland" (DeNiro co-stars too), he just hasn't picked the right project lately and his slide will only continue since he agreed to do Rocky VI. Why? In this film, drowning in music video-style editing and cutting, Stallone plays mob enforcer Jack Carter, dedicated to his job, he goes to Seattle for his brother's funeral and suspects it wasn't an accidental death after all. The film, which actually has a lot of familiar faces like character actor John C. McGinley as Carter's weaselly associate, an unbilled Tom Sizemore as Carter's hotheaded boss, and Michael Caine in what should've been an unbilled role. "Get Carter" isn't bad, it's very stylish and Stallone plays a character who doesn't have superhuman strength after all. The performances are good despite some small plot holes. It'd make a good rent on a Saturday night but don't pay to see it in theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dear God, what next......?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could not believe it when I heard that Hollywood was doing another remake of the British Gangster classic 'Get Carter'. There was a blaxploitation movie along the lines of 'Shaft' which was a direct copy of 'Get Carter' and that was enough to make your skin crawl. However my dismay that Hollywood was trying to recreate this tremendously atmospheric movie turned into sheer disbelief when I heard that Sly Stallone was going to be the main character. In the English original, Caine gives an excellent performance of a London villain tracking down his brother's killers in the north of England (Newcastle). He plays Carter as a menacing but well spoken and confident character.Stallone unfortunately couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag. Those who think his acting in the dreadfully boring 'Copland' was great, obviously believe that the ability to put on 50lbs and occasionally move your lips while mumbling incoherently, makes you a good actor. Wrong. To quote Dennis Pennis, 'He was so wooden, I thought someone had thrown a chair onto the screen'.Not only that, but did they raid Don Johnson's old Miami Vice wardrobe for Stallone's suits?The ending is also a typical Hollywood cop-out. Watch this movie, then watch the original to find out how a film should be made and how it should be ended.Still, in its favour the film does have the ever gorgeous Rachel Leigh Cook. Its not much, I know, but its a start.Overall I would call this film sacreligous. What next, are they going to to do a remake of another British classic 'The Long Good Friday' and have Adam Sandler playing Bob Hoskins' character, Harold Shand !!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film at a time when the theatre was otherwise busy, but found that I was the only one seeing Get Carter. Apparently the buzz was out on this film, and I quickly saw why. Speaking as someone who sees a lot of movies, this one was bad in just about every way a film can be. The script was boring and confusing. Most of the acting was OK (by Hollywood standards, that is) but it counted for little. The usually excellent Michael Caine added nothing and his character seemed artificial. Stallone did his usual character, and it was appropriate, but the way the story unfolded gave him little to do except ramdomly beat people up. The worst part of the film was the editing and related tricks, like unnecessary quick cuts, fast and slow motion, strange camera angles, etc. These served no purpose, did not advance the story or contribute to the atmosphere; but they did give me a headache.

		<shortDescription>Fails on many levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't let all that macho guts and gore fool you. There is a degree of symbolism hidden within the movie Get Carter that is there to see for all those who have consumed enough popcorn and soft drink to induce the kind of deep and perceptive thought that only a junk food rush can bring.Starring Sylvester Stallone as a Las Vegas mob enforcer, it opens with our hero chasing down and then pounding into a pulp a deadbeat debtor, while uttering such tough-guy witticisms as `Shut up, or I'm gonna take this to the next level.'`What's that? Some kind of catch-phrase?' observes the alert but lippy victim, displaying his aptitude for remembering slogans from commercials for video game makers. Never one to waste words, Stallone replies by transforming his client so much hamburger.Think of the deadbeat debtor as the personifying strong dialogue and you pretty much have captured the tenor of this movie. Barely five minutes into this flick and Sly has once again established that he won't be appealing to the art-house crowd.Of course, Stallone has always been about action, but even on that count he falls woefully short of potential. Indeed, this remake of the 1970 British movie of the same name fails on so many levels that it's difficult to know where to start. So let's begin with location.In the original, which starred Michael Caine, London-based tough guy Jack Carter returns home to the rough-and-tumble of Newcastle for his brother's funeral where he discovers that the death was something other than accidental. Nasty with a capital N, Carter uses his fists and firearms to exact revenge on the killers once he's gathered enough facts to know what really happened.The remake follows pretty much the same line except that, of all places, it's set in Seattle. Even at the best of times, it would be a challenge to bring out the seamy side of a city known more for computer geeks, slackers, and coffeehouses. And nothing in this movie does anything to alter that image as, the wrong side of the Emerald City's tracks consists of but a single bar owned by a nervous British ex-pat, Cliff Bumby, played with listlessness by a much older and softer Caine.To set the mood, we get Seattle's rain instead of Newcastle's industrial grittiness. And once again, it backfires. Rather than creating a sense of threat and foreboding, the weather does more to reinforce the greyness and dullness of the storyline. A game of Clue has more twists and turns.Matters aren't helped by a half-hearted attempt to add some complexity to the main character. Multiple-images, white flashes, fast-forwards, and Stallone rubbing his temples pass for psychological angst caused by the guilt surrounding his brother's death and an extraneous love-affair he's having with the mob-boss's woman.Likewise, the scenes in which he bonds with his niece, played by Rachel Leigh Cook, are also pointless. Meant to show that the tough guy has a soft-side, they're just plain boring.In fact, about the only time that Stallone comes to life is when he has a crusade. Upon learning that the same people who killed his brother are also responsible for his niece's rape, he finally has clarity of purpose. With guns blazing and arms swinging, he becomes a one-man army taking on the Internet pornography industry, which amounts to four people in the crime-ridden Northwest.Get Carter is just further proof that Stallone, despite his best efforts, is forever stuck in an endless cycle of simple redemption flicks. I suspect that the better option would be to tape the original if and when it's on late-night television, or rent the similarly-titled and themed, but much more entertaining Get Shorty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall, not bad at all...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this film , and I have never seen the original. Reading critic's reviews might lead one to think this film is awful, which is not the case at all. Keeping the expectation level somewhat low, I was a bit surprised to find I actually enjoyed most of Get Carter. It is certainly a cut above just about any major studio action film I have seen in the last year or so (with the notable exception of Gladiator). The film has a nice, dark noir style which perfectly suits the material. Some very nice shots and locations in and around Seattle (someone actually made a film there in the winter!!) I can only hope the very, very tired jump cut, herky-jerky style occasionally used in this film and so many others will finally go away. It is used only at times and really subtracts from the rhythym of the film which is mostly surprisingly slow. I personally welcomed this, as it gave the characters some time to get established and actually do some acting. I thought all the actors did fine, Stallone seemed to learn a thing or two from Copland and gives a surprsingly good performance. Concerning the other actors being underutilized, I think it's important to remember this is a Stallone movie, meaning it's about him, although Rachael Leigh-Cook gets a fair amount of time and does good work. The story was fairly interesting, and I liked the use of non-standard bad guys like the young computer billionaire. I didn't have any trouble following the story, but it could have used a bit more fleshing out. The action scenes are where the film stumbles. Just when it has a nice quirky, different-kind-of-a-film thing going, we get a very run of the mill, unmemorable Sly kicks ass scene. This is really a shame because if the same thought and sense of style had gone into the fight scenes and car chases as the rest of the film, I think it could have been very good. Overall, not exactly a thinking person's action film but in terms of Stallone movies this one is not a bad effort.</fullReview>

Just a little less vengefulness was needed in certain places.All and all, Sly Stallone's acting is enough to make this film entertaining. It is good to see him put himself and his style of acting into the film.I might add, movie score and incidental music was superb Good compositioning and orchestration. Good Seattle scenery, and some Pacific Northwest scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie "Get Carter" was a complete surprise to me. The director Stephen T. Kay has a remarkable film style that is reminiscent of European film-noir. This is a brutal and riveting film that mixes the bleakness of December in Seattle with the pitiless revenge of a man out to avenge his brother's death. Some of the action scenes are like having a seizure during a nightmare. Kay uses flashing lights and rain like an artist using oil paints. This script makes up for Stallone's "Cobra" days! This is [A] stuff! Look for the serene Tai-Chi class in the middle of a car chase. It is a wonderful contrast. Tom Grier Movie Reviewer for the Duluth Budgeteer and Superior Telegram.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stallone's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen the original version of Get Carter but after seeing this version i'm sure i will, this version of Get Carter is well shot and has top notch acting (especially from Stallone who gives one of my fave performances this year) but the thing that i remember the most is the ambient music especially the music playing during Carter's brother's funeral. I really loved this movie because it shows the desperation and frustrations of the main character better than the other two movies that came out a while back but almost had the same plot (those being Payback and The Limey). After this movie i hope Stallone gets on top again especially if he keeps his movies like this one (style, good action, and most of all the drama to make us care for the characters). If people say this movie sucks they are full of s*** because this movie (along with The Cell) is one of the years best. I gotta get the soundtrack cause it's all good...except the Get Carter theme song during the credits is cheesy. Also watch for the trailer for Stallone's other new movie Driven.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sylvester Stallone has one of his greatest performances of all time in this remake of the 70's original Get Carter. Ranks right up there with the ROCKY series, (my personal favorites!!) In the movies, Stallone plays Jack Carter, a vicious hitman who returns home for his brothers funeral, and becomes determined to find his brothers killer. The ending is amazing alone! this is a 10 in my book! great great movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect of comebacks, marking the return of a legendary action star</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll keep this short and sweet. First off, Sly, does not deserve a Razzie for this. It's a great comeback, after his bestest in 98's Copland, and he's very good in this role, a trifle menacing, yes. In fact I'd rather watch Sly than Caine, who ironically plays a shady villain in this. Caine's dull expressions and deadpan looks he brought to the Carter role, though indeed, he was much more menacing, just somehow created a real dullness, where Stallone adds a lot of flare to the role, (the actors business) someone you don't want double cross, one guy, so lucky for having Carter spare him, was a moment I found gruelingly tense. Again it's family vengeance for Jack Carter, who leans on people who are late with their payments by use of physical force. One term to describe these heavies are called Shylocks. Stallone is given great dialogue, and has some great acting support from Miranda Richardson, very strong, Caine, character actor, John Mcginley as one of Sly's own, and another baddie Mickey Rourke, no longer a pretty face. He's given some great dialogue too. Jack who's brother was caught up in some dirty dealings involving prostitution and making sex tapes, his need to get to the bottom of this really grows, especially when his niece (Rachel Leigh Cook-very good) is caught up in it. Then he really steams. Here's a guy who's not gonna stop until he finds his man, where he doesn't like outside interruptions, like from Mcginley who he pummels the s..t out of in an elevator, to the racey tune of an instrumental "Jingle Bells". Again here's a livelier remake I like better than the original, which some great action sequences, including a thrilling car chase, hey, but what's a Sly movie without action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Get Carter 2000 has perhaps some major improvements over the original and then again the original was Streamlined it only had one story really. Stallone's Get Carter is a very smart sleek gangster flick but in transplanting it to Seattle instead of London takes some of the originals magic away and makes it less of a film somehow. Ted Lewis's Jack Carter was a British hit-man thru and thru and he did not have any emotional attachments to anyone or anything whatsoever he was a complete killing machine and a complete Bastard with little or no regard for anyone except himself. Having read two of the Carter books Jack Carter's Law and Jack Carter and the mafia pigeon. Carter was the perfect Anti hero he did whatever he wanted when he wanted. No one pushed him around. GET CARTER 2000 however tries very hard to make Stallone's Carter menacing and hardcore. He comes across briefly at the beginning when he's reminding someone of the financial obligation they have to his boss. But even then he's tossing off clichéd one liners that ruin his character. "My Name is Jack Carter and you don't want to know me" (Actually my favourite line of his in the movie) "We're gonna take this up to the next level" Actually said while he's beating a man who smart mouths him. And of course the subplot JAck is dating his employer's wife and his employer doesn't want Jack to go to Seattle for his brother's funeral so his boss gets upset. He send's two of his goons to bring Jack back. Jack meanwhile is investigating his brother's death. And Trying to connect with his sister in law and his niece Doreen which only makes him out to be a teddy bear of a hit-man. this plus assorted characters pull the movie in too many directions. Stephen Kay is a competent director but he lets the material run away from him and does not rein it in. Two wonderful saving Graces that Save the movie from taking itself too seriously. Mickey Rourke as a Porn King Nemesis of Jack's Rourke carries himself with a fine line of danger and comedy he underplays Cyrus Pace that he actually steals his scenes from Stallone who almost overacts in the movie. I would have loved to have SEEN Mickey Rourke as Jack Carter That would've been interesting. And the Best part Michael Caine as Cliff Grumby the owner of the bar where Jack's brother worked and owned part of that bar. Caine is 100% percent a gulity pleasure he's worth the price of admission and the price of popcorn and other snacks Caine is the movie! The movie has some good moments and some not so good moments but it's done with a film noir type style in mind. The movie is not a bad movie and it cravenly did not deserve the bad reviews or those Razzies it garnered. The movie is simply another attempt to tell one of the greatest gangster stories of all time. Well Worth seeing and worth the time to take to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First things first, I want to clear something up. The critics are wrong again. Worst remake ever? Get serious. Not even close. Has any of this armchair experts bothered to watch the new "Stepford Wives" or "Planet of the Apes"? I can easily list two dozen remakes that sucked far far worse. With that out of the way, I want to say I liked Stallone he was a obvious choice and especially Mickey Rourke. Rourke had just the right mix of sleaze ball zen master attitude and macho coolness to pull it off. Caine was a perfect addition to the mix. Test audiences agreed. Rachel Leigh Cook was a tad weak but not bad. Same goes for the actress who played her mother. McGinley as Con McCarty was both funny and enjoyable. Loved his character the most. Even though it's not a loyal remake, it is a fun and hip remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sylvester Stallone has disappointed the world again with his latest film, "Get Carter" because it is so dreary and dry. In no uncertain terms, "Get Carter" had no reason to be made. I don't understand why so many talented actors signed up to participate in a movie that drains the life out of you."Get Carter" is a one dimensional failure that tries to pass itself off as an action film. While this is called an action film, there is absolutely zero action; furthermore, the story is so dull and unimaginative, I couldn't wait until it was over. The biggest thing that bothered me was the movie seemed to put me to sleep because it ran out of ideas to talk about within the first 45 minutes. The ideas the writers came up with were recycled as well as boring.Another awful aspect about "Get Carter" was the fact the performances by each actor were translucent, uninspired and seemed to be very shallow and insincere as well. Overall, "Get Carter" is one of the worst action films made in 2000.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original 'Get Carter' is one of my favourite movies, and I rented this remake from the bargain bin expecting a disaster. I was pleasantly surprised by some aspects of this movie. For one, Stallone puts in a very good performance as Carter. Mickey Rourke &amp; Alam Cumming also shine, but it's the direction of this movie as well as changes to the plot which really let this movie down. It's MTV cinema - scenes are edited to the soundtrack rather than the story &amp; flashy visual effects are utilised inappropriately, giving the movie the feel of a pop video rather than a movie. In terms of the story, Stallone's Carter is a much more politically correct character than the Caine original which weakens the story - for an example he's nice to women &amp; doesn't kill any!. I'm sure all the scenes of him 'bonding' with his niece were installed for Stallone to show his range as an actor, but considering the nature of Carter's 'profession', they just don't seen believable. Compared to the original this remake does not pack the same punch - as good as Rourke &amp; Cumming are, they nowhere near as good as Ian Hendry and John Osborne in their respective roles. 'Get Carter' is well worth a viewing, but the original is for me superior.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the movie starts, you hear pretentious music. Sylveser Stallone is on a funeral with his classy sunglasses and his designer suit. This all wants to look full of promise. It is already way to obvious. The director is still in the conviction that he can move his audience with these simple and obvious tricks. This does not work, at least not with a critical public that has seen some more movies. Sylvester Stallone plays the part of Jack Carter, performed before by Micheal Caine who stars in this movie as well. Jack Carter is mad because his brother has been culled by either Jeremy Kinnear (Alan Cumming) or Cyrus Paice (Mickey Rourke). He wants of course, as it behooves a real hero, immediate retaliation. He is going to scare Jeremy and Cyrus. Our stalwart fellow gets in his beautiful Cadillac, puts his gun in his pocket and drives to the victims he is going to take care of. Actually that is what the story is about. We should not forget the girl, performed by Rachael Leigh Cook.Almost everything about this movie is bad. The story is as shallow as a baby tub, the dialogs are awful and the acting is brazenly bad. Sylvester Stallone plays his worst part ever. Stallone must be either Rambo or Rocky, but not Jack Carter. This man is not able to express emotions. Throughout the whole movie he plays the tough guy, right in the middle however he is this sensitive man who can cry as well. I can't even remember why he actually cried, but it was about something silly. Stallone is a strong man who can run after bears and shoot with bazookas, but he is absolutely not apt to play a normal human being with feelings.The dialogs are horrible. It goes approximately like this: Doreen: Why did you leave when your mother died? Jack: Just because, what is your favorite color? Doreen: Pink, yours? Jack: Blue. Doreen: Why? Jack: Just because.The dialog is as thin as paper. When something is stated, the actors just do not go any deeper. The questions are answered briefly and then the dialog continues with another silly question.Mickey Rourke does, except for his muscles, not add anything to the movie. His dialog is shallow as well, he is the tough guy who should be removed by Jack 'the man' Carter.Of the actors are not culpable of the bad dialogs. It must be terrible to star in a movie which is directed by such an ignorant director. You must earn your money however, otherwise there will be no bread in the cupboard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Another Rambo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This action-drama is never really a thriller. That's because the mostly predictable storyline revolves around one man's desire for revenge. Jack Carter (Sylvester Stallone), a trained killer, spends a third of his journey using violence to learn the truth of his brother's death. The other two thirds he spends inflicting death on those he deems responsible for the younger Carter's demise.The dynamic between Carter's niece, Doreen, and Jack does play out beautifully. But more of the screenplay could have been devoted to this relationship. Instead, the writer makes sure that it's just enough to justify Stallone's gun-toting or fist-wielding ways.I began to question the realism of this film early on. For one thing, we never hear a police siren until the final seconds of the movie. Enough people lose their life in this film, that this makes Carter's ho-hum killing spree seem pretty unbelievable. That makes the rest of this flick come tumbling down, since old-fashioned justice is the point of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Under-rated film. Actually a stylish masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Stephen T. Kay (of "The Shield" fame) comes a Get Carter 're-make', but viewers shouldn't treat this as a re-make of the film - rather a modern re-interpretation of the book "Jack's Return Home" (1970). The basic premise is the same, an injustice followed by revenge - but this film is an excellent work in it's own separate right. The limited connections between the films are the book, the film title and a few references to the 1971 film (and Caine's presence in both). There is a lot of "film snobbery" out there about Stallone and it's true that he's had his fair share of c*** films, but this isn't one of them. His acting would put a lot of people to shame, in fact it's a superb performance (also see "Copland"). His presence dominates his scenes, only Caine and Mickey Rourke's presence competes. The supporting actors are very good too and the storyline is such that if you blink you'll miss the thread. People who say "I didn't get it", frankly just need to see the film again. It definitely deserves multiple viewings. Also, look how many comments the film has - always a good guide as to whether a film has made an impact or not - twice as many as the original and 2/3 as many as Taxi Driver.....Not to mention the film is beautifully shot, brilliantly edited and has a Greeaaat soundtrack!</fullReview>

Not good.Good to see Michael Caine though.I own the original. Would never watch this again. In the original Caine was shot for his troubles.

I didn't see the original, so I didn't go into Get Carter with any expectations on how it would do as a remake. I judged the movie on its own merit. The acting was good; the story was interesting, and the action was captivating. Stallone pulled off the tough guy character brilliantly; he genuinely came across as one mean SOB without any cheese; that's hard to do. It would have been easy to overdo the role. If people want to bash Stallone, they've got plenty of material to do it with. Get Carter is not additional ammunition for that cause. Sly: hold your head up on this one.

The only thing this movie has going for itself is Stallone's cool beard, some nice chicks(Rhona Mitra is breathtaking) and some cool music. The rest is a puzzle of mostly boring action, bad story pace and one liners Stallone's character has to use twice just to show how dumb and uninventive he is.

		<fullReview>Why can't Carter live his own life instead of being barked at by his sister in-law about not being home to hold his brother's hand over the past years? That was an early annoyance on his hectic quest to find his brother's killer. Also: why can't a grown-up women (his niece) who chose to take drugs and have sex with a man and another woman settle for what she had done? Actually, she took that decision better than Carter; cause Carter, being a professional thug, and not being open minded on the matters that women are fickle, had to take the action she participated in as a rape; which he then took action against the man he considered a rapist. He took action against his colleagues from Las Vegas who had trailed him to Seattle because of his own intervention with adultery. (It's okay for Carter to involve himself in bad decisions but anyone else). Eventually he gets to the man who killed his brother, and has a vigorous fist fight to his hearts content. (Which was not too bad of a scene. Better than a shootout). Unfortunately, Hollywood being as it is nowadays, cast a geek as the billionaire who is indirectly involved with the brother's murder; but other than that particular miscast the other characters were in form. Not really too bad as a remake. My personal choice though would have been to have Mickey Rourke as Carter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While it's true that Get Carter was a ridiculous film, if you hated it, you have no one to blame but yourself. Unfortunately, Sylvester Stallone may be the most typecast actor working today, and the type of role that he is able to fill is generally found in terrible action films, like this one. There's not much left to do in the whole tough guy revenge type of action film (was there much in the first place?), and Get Carter covers no new ground.Not only is this movie awkwardly trying to resurrect a thankfully dead theme, but it is also even a re-make of the 1971 version of Get Carter, which was exactly the same premise. Some huge tough guy from out of town is here to revenge his brother, no matter who tries to stop him or for what reason. This stuff belongs in action movies that do not try to hide the fact that they are goofy B-movies (ever see Kickboxer?). The mystery behind the fact that a respected actor made the potentially career damaging decision to act in this film (Michael Caine) can be answered because he played the part of Jack Carter in the original 1971 version of Get Carter, which is far superior to this re-make. However, despite the fact that this film was a bitter disappointment, it did have it's redeeming values. John C. McGinley delivered one of the better performances in the entire film, and the fight scenes were entertaining enough, despite their ridiculous exaggeration. There can be no mistake that this is goofy cinema, so if you decide to watch it, keep that in mind.</fullReview>

Or was he? He proceeds to prod his brother's wife (Miranda Richardson) and daughter (Rache Leight Cook) about the death and soon encounters characters that suggest there was foul play.Suffice to say, this isn't your typical car-chase, explosion, fistfight, shoot-out, testosterone-pumped action flick. Instead, we're given a mystery/thriller with a sometimes too conventional, and at other times well-plotted story. It moves with such confidence in its deliberate slowness and is an excellent change of pace for Stallone, offering more than a slick talking bad ass and actually fleshing out a performance. There are times that he even pokes fun at his own age, in a manner both funny and endearing, as if he knows he's a little over the hill but still trudging on.Get Carter proves that though Stallone may have peaked a while ago and has become an iconoclast of the typical mindless action star, he can still offer up a fun and entertaining performance in a decent blend of the action and mystery genres. While the action scenes are decent, it's when he's pushing around the equally fun Alan Cumming that are Carter's best moments.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a mediocre remake of a 1971 film by the same name, with Sylvester Stallone inheriting the title role from Michael Caine (who also has a minor role in this film). The screenplay has been updated to make it more techie (cyber porn, cell phones and internet billionaires). Writer David McKenna (`American History X') attempts to flesh out Carter a bit more and make him a nice guy in a bad profession. Unfortunately, while that helps, the dialogue is uniformly bad and the characters are boringly stereotypical.Director Stephen Kay is creative with the camera, but adds excessive style without regard to substance. He throws every technique ever invented into the frame in a flurry of strange camera angles, strobe effects and fast forward photography. The result is a presentation that is more idiosyncratic than brilliant. There is so much hand held photography that by the end of the film, the viewer has whiplash from trying to follow the action. Speaking of action, there is not much of it. There is a lot of talk, a few fistfights and one decent car chase and that is about it. For a film that clearly targets a male audience, this film fails to deliver what guys want most.Stallone gives his standard tough guy performance, which is generally among the best in the business. He is still in good shape at 54, but one has to wonder how much longer he can keep playing these characters before it becomes incongruous. As has been the rule in remakes of late, the former Carter, Michael Caine is given a supporting role in this film. Caine is excellent as the slime bag pulling the strings behind the scenes. Rachel Leigh Cook also gives a fine performance as Carter's niece, and does an outstanding job in one poignant scene where she describes to her uncle how she was raped. Alan Cumming plays a sniveling rich boy who made millions in technology and provides an almost comic contrast to Stallone's deadly seriousness. Mickey Roarke provides his character with a sinister and despicable personality, and is still as tough as they come. However, he is another actor whose thug days are numbered. I rated this film a 5/10. Despite some good acting, a dull script is embellished with unnecessary directorial flourishes making it more annoying than entertaining . Women subtract at least two points for testosterone overload.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wo, is that Stallone?!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For any Stallone fan who has seen Rocky, FIST or even Copland and expects to see their favorite tough-nice-guy in another movie, think again. Only Stallone could go from the extreme of Rocky and end up playing the other end of the spectrum as the be-all and end-all of bad guys, as Jack Carter. He has his reasons for being this way but Carter is frankly dispicable, which is the goal with this movie. He's just plain ugly and Stallone does an incredible job of making you hate him. The only good thing, is that you hate the antagonists even more than you hate Carter. A great movie with directing like nothing you have seen, this movie hits home. Right up there with the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I was 16 I would have liked this movie. Lots of tough guy heavy talk with significant conversations and rapid retorts. But I've seen all these cliches over the years and I wish for real people saying real things. It seems most of the Carter's suffer from clinical depression and just mope through life smoking cigarettes and complaining. The plot was barely there mostly being a confused reason for Stallone to beat people up. Special effects were routine and poorly done. The roads were alternately wet and dry through the chase sequence; the shot out back window appeared and disappeared. Continuity was poor. Watch the cigarette ash, cigarettes seem to burn backwards, the ash shortening. And those sequences with Carter and the dull niece drawn out with a leitmotif of maudlin music, excruciating. Mickey Rourke looks like he is swimming in steroids. He is creepy. The whole movie and cast needs some shock treatments to bring them back to reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good directing,excellent story, Sly at his best! Don't miss it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is good. Its story may seem like an ordinary action movie, but it's more than that. I think it's a remake of a 70's film of the same name. It has something from 70's in it. Especially in car chasing sequences which are, in my opinion, excellent.The movie is about a tough 'bodyguard' Jack Carter(Sylvester Stallone) working in Las Vegas who comes back to his hometown for his brother's funeral who left his wife and teenage daughter behind. The cause of his death seems to be a drunkdriving situation but Sly thinks it's not that simple.He hasn't seen his brother for 5 years and feels responsible for his death. He has done mistakes in the past and wants to make a new beginning. Deciding to stay in a hotel for the weekend, he fights both with his conscience and people who killed his brother. During these two days he knows his niece Doreen (Rachael Leigh Cook) better and they develop some kind of a father-daughter relationship. Cook acts quite well and gives clues for future successes.Sly is one of my favorites and he is superb in this movie. With both "Copland" and "Get Carter", I think he proved that he can play in dramas as well as action.If you wanna see a good movie with good directing and some sense of 70's, see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a flop before the opening credits are done. 'Get Carter' should have been named ' I'm going in circles, get me out.' Stallone plays the macho Carter. However, the character has no depth, style or dialogue to be the main character. The whole concept is Stallone trying to find out who 'took out his brother'. Get Carter spins with poor subplots, bad acting, and over used one-liners, making the movie drawn out and boring. The action scene last seconds, and do not even belong in this movie. The rough and tough image is skewed with large gaps in the story line, acting and directing. At times the movie seems to be shot by a two year old, playing with his parents camcorder. Movies need a good screenpay and a good director. 'Get Carter' had none of these. Better to stay home than dish money on this weak and stupid afterthought.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For once the strobelightesque fight scenes did annoy me to no end. They were there, but this is the first time I think it worked. Clear enough to see the action, but fast enough to make it seem more intense.The story as a whole was on the weak side. There were a lot of plot holes and lack of clarity. A lot of stuff that Carter discovers are too much by luck. I would also have liked to see some of the minor characters get more fleshed out and to have bigger rolls. Such as Michael Cain, and the computer guy. They only show up long enough to say their cute lines and drop there plot point and then disappear again.Overall though I would say this is one of the better action movies that has come out recently. Sure the plot is not that great, but the mood was good, the action was good, the overall characterizations were crisp.</fullReview>

(All of his movies have had somewhat of a plot, but this one probably has the best.) If you are not a Stallone fan you might not enjoy it as much as fans will, but if I were you, I'd go see it for myself. Don't always listen to reviews, whether you like the movie depends on you.

		<fullReview>Okay, so it's not his "best" film but it is certainly a far cry from his worst. How many crapola movies have we tolerated over the years? Too many. This one actually takes the time to set up the plot (that "boring" first half some critics point to) and then executes (no pun intended) the action resulting from the plot in the second half. As far as Stallone's acting goes: I think he did a fine job. He's not playing the Pope here kids, he's playing a thug. A thumb-breaking thug with a chip on his shoulder. I don't know what critics were looking for but he's true to the character through and through. If you liked Copland and Lock Up, you should appreciate this movie. Or, if you're looking for Sly to cry like a baby for two hours and be sentimental that his character's brother was offed... well, you're gonna have to skip this one. Go rent a Meryl Streep flick instead. What ever happened to movies that sought to entertain the audience by giving them a guilty pleasure? Fifteen years ago Stallone would be the talk of the town for a movie like this. Now, critics in "Corporate Hollywood" are biased against him making a movie that mostly guys will like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent action/revenge flick; triumph for Stallone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, to enjoy this film, forget that it is a supposed "remake" of the 1971 Michael Caine classic. Just imagine that it's called CARTER'S REVENGE and accept it on its own terms. After taking that approach, I found this new GET CARTER to be one of the most intelligent and satisfying mainstream action films since OUT OF SIGHT. Beautiful photography, dizzying editing and camera angles, a pulsating Jellybean Benitez-supervised musical score, and another bravura performance by Sylvester Stallone, as a hitman/enforcer who has constructed a world where he lives by a personal code, but whose world begins to fall apart as he tries to reclaim a sense of "home." Even the minor characters in the film are fascinating, and the film is packed with jump cuts (with seeming continuity errors) and scenes that appear to be flashbacks but must be Carter's imagining of scenes he could not possibly have witnessed. Like a 70s European crime film, the film will probably reward multiple viewings. It manages to satisfy on the revenge-film level (like Charles Bronson films did 25 years ago) while being postmodern in feel and technique. Viewers who don't like Stallone or crime/action films should NOT see the new GET CARTER. Viewers who were enthralled by, say, THE LIMEY or JACKIE BROWN (as I was) should find the film well worth the money. Just don't try to compare this with the original GET CARTER-- they are apples and oranges. A great followup to COPLAND for Stallone! (Mickey Rourke fans will get a kick out of seeing Sly Stallone and Rourke beat the &amp;%$*#% out of each other here, remembering Rourke's endless fighting with FRANK Stallone in BARFLY!)</fullReview>

Stallone is superb as Jack Carter, a debt collector who comes across as what Rocky Balboa might have ended up as if fate hadn't given him a shot at the title against Apollo Creed and if mobster Gazzo had managed to get his hooks into him a bit more. Michael Caine and Mickey Rourke sizzle in a quality but somewhat eccentric supporting cast that includes Miranda Richardson and Alan Cumming as Americans. The moody, rain-soaked locations (it's set in bleak Seattle), shot with a tremendous sense of style by director Stephen Kay and cinematographer Maurio Fiore, as well as full-blooded performances and scenes of bonecrunching violence give the film much more resonance than the script, but it's still a watchable thriller with an offbeat atmosphere that stands up to more than one viewing and doesn't deserve the automatic wide berth many would no doubt give it.

However, except for the editing. this remake of "Get Carter" is surprisingly good. Not for the "art film" people, those should stay out and watch something they can understand, but, for the action fans who survive the dull beginning, this is a rather nice "film noir".Stallone teaches family values. He is a Las Vegas bookmaker/casino owner's strong-arm assistant who goes to Seattle when his brother dies in a car accident, and starts investigating. He even cries when he gives his niece some good advice for a perturbed teenager. She is played by Rachael Leigh Cook, who does undoubtedly the best acting in the film. Mickey Rourke and Michael Caine aren't bad either, in rather minor parts. If you are a Stalone fan, or enjoy action films, don't miss this one; you'll get good car chases, and some very minor fight scenes.

		<fullReview>This movie is surprisingly good. It is certainly one of Stallone's best movies of recent years."Get Carter" is very interesting because it's one of the few big Hollywood movies that actually can be taken fairly seriously. There is much less glitter and fluff in this movie than what is now common. There aren't dozens of explosions, the car chases are realistic and well filmed, etc. Stallone actually does a good job, and the other actors are well chosen. I would say that the major detraction--the only thing that prevents this from being a very good movie (rather than merely a good one)--is the dialogue. It's obvious some idiotic Hollywood screenwriter had his way, and some lines that are just totally unnecessary.The question the movie raises is one that all men must deal with at some point: how to handle the impulse of vengeance. In all, "Get Carter" is a very entertaining movie that is actually quite realistic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake - with heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike the Mel Gibson Payback rehash of the same novel that inspired the Lee Marvin Point Blank, Get carter is a true remake/update. Lines and image composition recur in Kay's film from Michael Hodges' original script. Especially check out the sequence in each film where Carterforces one of the guilty parties to drive into the dark woods where he has to decide how to mete out justice.... Well, let's discuss that scene, because it is crucial to both films, and the differing decisions the two Carters make tells us the difference between the two films. In Hodges' film, Carter kills the person with an overdose of heroin. In Kay's Carter scares the pee out of the person, then leaves off with a warning. The ethic of the first film is such that this becomes an act for which we cannot forgive Carter, because the person he happens to be killing is actually as much a victim of the criminal enterprise Carter bucks as are the people he's supposedly avenging. In other words, he's committing the same crime he's accusing his victim of. In the commentary on the DVD, Kay is very clear about the ethic of his own version - "revenge isn't justice." So of course, the person Carter almost kills has to be represented as into something way over his head; the warning thus may work as well as any punishment to change this behavior. Does this make Kay's film lesser than the original? Not by itself. But it does highlight the real weakness of the Kay version - He has a firm grasp on how these people relate to each other as people, but he doesn't really understand how criminals relate to other criminals - which of course is precisely what gave the original its vicious edge. Stallone's Carter needs to be way more ruthless and scary than he is now. This is a guy who beats up people for money - are we to presume that he never "accidently" beat some innocent schmo with a bad debt to death? And had this been emphasized, his response to his niece would actually have been perceived as all the stronger, since this man is really unredeemable, even by his own standards. The way this misstep effects Kay's film is that he frequently moves the camera around the story, rather than positioning it in the middle of the action (this is really done on the editing board, using the now-stale MTV choppy style that real cineastes have grown to loathe). Whereas the continuity of the original film was fiercesomely linear and direct to the point, the continuity of Kay's film leaves threads dangling that we really need tied up.Having said all this, I must also commend a film that, to be honest, I have really grown to love. It's a personal affection, but it does say something about Kay and his actors. I happen to know all these people, or I have met them along the way. I know exactly what Stallone's Carter is feeling for his niece and why, and how he will respond - how he must respond - to her victimization. Kay is quite right when he claims that this is the heart of his movie. Like most other viewers, I only wish he had taken it to the same limits as the Hodges' film, which he so clearly admires.</fullReview>

He delivers his dialogue impeccably, and we get the sense that Carter is a real person who is hurting and filled with regret about not patching things up with his brother. To make things worse for Carter, nobody cares that he's trying to make things right. That automatically made me want to root for Carter because there's nothing like putting the good guy in a situation where good guys and bad guys are discouraging him from finding out the truth. But he keeps on plowing through.Stallone is also surrounded by a very effective cast. John C. McGinley as Con McCarty is probably one of my favorites, "I'm like a broken f*ckin' record. If you don't care of business, the business will take care of you. The business will take care of you. THE BUSINESS WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU."Mickey Rourke, who has aged so badly and makes a perfect sleazebag, also turns in one of his better performances in a while. At first, he seems like the quintessential bad guy. Cocky, shady, and completely repulsive. But Rourke makes the character appear to have some kind of gray area.Alan Cumming plays Jeremy like Alan Cumming, a smiling, effete, "scaredy cat" who can't hide his fright whenever Carter even looks at him.Jeremy: Ok, scary man...Carter (grinning): I scare you?It's this kind of interaction, tough aura and charisma that I really miss in Stallone's more recent films. Sure, there are a few obligatory fight scenes where Carter has to beat the crap out of some low level thugs, but it's all in fun. And it's done with style, which is always important in a movie like this. Director Stephen Kay infuses the film with really cool music, camera work and a real noir feel.Some people will whine that this is a matter of style over substance. This is an action film, people. If you want some substance to go with your style, rent The Godfather, or Psycho, or Last Tango In Paris. Go to the drama section of the video store. You don't rent movies like Get Carter, The Rock, Rambo: First Blood Part II, or latter day Bond movies for grand substance.About the only thing I didn't like about Get Carter, which admittedly is a big let down, is that the fate of one of the major characters is unknown. I'm not sure what Kay was trying to accomplish by leaving this character's fate to our imagination, but the idea was a misfire. The epilogue also seemed a bit too sudden, but by this point, I had enjoyed the time I spent with Get Carter and liked it enough to buy it on DVD.As a final note, this is not a typical slambang action film with explosions going off every five minutes. If you liked Payback with Mel Gibson---a kind of stylish, noir, toned-down action film---then my guess is that you'd enjoy Get Carter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been awhile since I've seen a movie this bad. The direction was unbearable, the acting was, for the most part, atrocious. There was more than one point in this film that my wife and I looked at each other and said "Huh?" By far the worst Stallone movie I have ever seen. In fact, ranks up there with the all time worst movies I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All time number one crime in the movies, nobody went to see Get Carter. For me one of Stallone's finest movies, and definitely one of his best performances. This movie was backed up by a stellar supporting cast, great music, great cinematography and, of course, Michael Caine. I think the real treat for me is when Stallone gets to deliver Caine's iconic "you're a big man" line to Caine himself. I own a video shop and I constantly recommend this title to my customers, and not one of them have ever complained when they've bought it back. I think it really sucks that this was one of Stallone's biggest flops when it truly deserved to place him right back on top of the Hollywood pile. Sorry Sly, but remember Van Gogh never sold a painting when he was alive, look at him now. This film will go down as a classic I'm sure, just give people time to appreciate it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a truly dreadful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I truly wanted this film to be good, but as i suspected it is terrible.The film manages to wimp out at every moment that made the Caine version so hard hitting, brutal and memorable. Kay has given many of the charcters a moral compass, and from what i can see, for no other reason than that the producers obviously think an American audience need clearly drawn boundaries between who is 'good' and who is 'bad'. Stallone's burgeoning relationship with his niece (she is definitely his neice, none of the ambiguity concerning the girl's parentage in this version)is perhaps one of the most ill advised plot developments ever written. One minute he hardly knows her, the next they are big buddies. He even gives up smoking for chrissakes! Stallone's Carter is a far more sensitive man that Caine's and ultimately this is what makes the film so pedestrian. He has gone back home more in an attempt to fix the broken pieces of his own life, rather than in search of vengeance. The porno movie elements lack the genuine unpleasantness of the original, the movie balks at any realistic violence in favour of a more dumbass hollywood approach where grown men can fight for twenty minutes without collapsing from exhaustion. and what is all this rubbish about 'taking things to the next level'? This may be abit of a hastily written review, but words cannot express how crap this film is, especially when viewed in the light of the superior original. Im no film purist, (i genuinely think Money Train is a good film) but even without the memory of Hodge's film, Get Carter 2000 fails to convince. Having said that, the beefed up score (though underused) is a treat, and the title sequence on the train at the beginning is great. There is perverse pleasure to be taken in how dreadful this whole movie is, but i've seen grittier episodes of Airwolf than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here is a 'Stallone role' that I've been waiting for...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh yes he's heavy and he ain't got a brother anymore. I saw this in 2000, (in THX -Dolby ) I was engulfed from the moment it came onto the screen!! that is probably the best way to view this, on a huge screen with a kickin' surround sound system, in the dark! Undistracted of course.For one the story fit him, the scenery, taking place up in Seattle was a smart departure from some of the other movies he's made. A different town than Vegas and L.A. for a lone-shark heavy who is looking to settle a major score. Stallone is a marvel in this picture ( for me anyway ) I don't mind if some others would not agree on that. The music scoring from Mr. Bates was authentic in that it captured the film's situations movement and the places that the story took course. From the train itself to the rainy weather, and the cemetery etc. I was so into this story and the fact that the music was right on the money, that it literally mesmerized, as I watched everything take place! A day of reckoning for Jack, in regard to his brother's untimely death. Actually, in this story as Jack catches up to an old acquaintance, (Rourke) who is very stubborn and truly as strong as a bull, a real fighter. Mickey Rourke, I believe was at his apex, in looks and ability, for this. He seems so different now a days.Michael Caine plays a seedy character, looking somewhat financially made, but washed out as a man standing against Jack, he was perfect for the part as well. He dresses impeccably well and yet, he will bust heads in order to get his business done. I thoroughly enjoyed the performances, the rainy weather, music score and the scenery that Stephen Kay put together for "Get Carter" (The Truth Hurts) .I felt, again as if the studio tampered with the ending and it did not stay true to the story, thats why I rate it a 9 not a ten. Even so... I would say it is worth the time of the die hard Stallone fans to see this, even for those lovers of drama and revenge stories. Recommended (****)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It hurts me to say it, but another misfire from Stallone...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must confess I hadn't seen the original Get Carter before watching this.I'm glad, this way I'm not biased.Carter is a 'heavy' for a loanshark. When he hears about his brothers death he travels back to his home town he left years ago to dish out some pain, and (of course) play father to his Brother's daughter. What follows is a gangster farce about porn, hookers and 'Mr. Bigs'. Sounds cool?, in fact Sly even looks cool, but unfortunately it isn't.Get Carter (2002) is one of the best looking movies stallone has ever been cast in. The cinematography of Mauro Fiore (Training Day) is exquisite. It's a shame that Director Stephen Kay couldn't match that. And I'm not sure what went wrong with the editing (strange, because it was the same guy who edited 'Apocalypse Now'). The Film just feels out of sync. It doesnt flow very well at all. The action is good(if too sparse) but seems to have an unwelcome comedy feel to it throughout. John McGinley, and Mickey Rourke in particular, give excellent performances as the bad guys. What bothers me is Stallone's attempt to play a 'hard man' and 'long lost loving uncle' at the same time. It just doesn't work. Stallone isn't helped either by the rest of the cast which boasts Rhona Mitra as a main character(with a particularly poor performance). Miranda Richardson suffers too in this movie as Carter's Brother's wife. Surprisingly, Michael Caine makes a cameo too, although I can't help thinking I wish he hadn't.It could have been brilliant, but instead it's (dare I say it) a hard to follow, badly paced, and forgettable film. That sounds bad, but it's still worth a rent though (even just for the fact it looks great).I'll give it 5/10. Average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Carter left his Seattle home to become a Las Vegas mob casino financial enforcer. He returns for the funeral of his brother Richie' after a car crash during a storm. Talking to daughter Doreen, Jack suspects it was murder. Cliff Brumby, whose club Richie ran, is financially linked to porn and prostitution baron Cyrus Paice, who claims to be just a front-man for IT tycoon Jeremy.After Jack finds a CD, containing images of Doreen, Jack goes after the lot of them...I've always had a fondness for this movie, but then again, I've never compared it to the remake, just as a stand alone Stallone vehicle.And it works this way. Compared to the original, it's just a remake by name, and loosely on the story, nothing else.Stallone is good in his role, but he especially shines when he shares scenes with Leigh Cook, the two of them have some real chemistry, and gives the film a more humanistic feel to it.There are some strange, but effective direction styles, especially when Mcginley is on screen, different alternates to situations and lines repeated in different manners, odd but strangely compelling.The rest of the cast support Stallone well, and make the film that little bit more classier than it should be, but all in all its a solid movie, pointless remake.If your a fan of Stallone, see this, it's really not as bad as the naysayers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything from the ambiance to the camera work to the acting to the story was excellent. I especially love the moodiness of this film. It really has a great kind of calm seriousness and charisma. The characters are a little exaggerated but just about every movie exaggerates personalities for the sake of effectual entertainment. The movie has a great play on personal introspection- how all of the characters are flawed but yet the good guys are somehow clearly differentiated from the bad guys. Also the personal relationships between the characters are at times very entertaining especially the relationship between Jack Carter and Doreen. The director did a good job with choosing the music for the film, which really blends great with the cinematography and in how they develop the mood of each scene. The color coordination and overall look of the film is great, with lots of rain scenes which don't create a depressing aura, but a calm kind of introspective ambiance- which works well with the emotional circumstances of the story. But to enjoy this movie you have to enjoy the classic western style- good guy comes into town and takes out the trash- kind of fable. However this movie does more than just that by brilliantly wielding modernistic style to go beyond the old proverbial storyline and produce a richer more emotionally filling experience. By the way, Stallone did a very good job acting in this one. His performance was better than his Rocky films- and I would give his acting an 8 out of 10. I really appreciate his straight forward kind of acting as opposed to the recently developed sour, plastic, melodramatic and fake eccentricity which characterizes modern "good acting." Get Carter does the job straight up for an enjoyable, well produced action thriller, with an added moderate portion of drama and emotive value. I just truly and personally thought this was an excellent film despite what others have concluded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, They Tried.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's always a dangerous move to remake an earlier movie, especially when the first was an absolute classic. I mean; what more can you add?Furthermore, when the original was set in one national culture and the remake in a different one, it doesn't follow that all the cultural nuances will translate. For example; when was the last time you heard of an American girl called 'Doreen'? The name is practically extinct even in Britain, now. And consider how often Americans in extremis utter the phrase 'son-of-a-bitch'; the equivalent British would be far more graphic. Like the 'Italian Job' remake, this movie should simply have had another name - and a substantially altered script. Taken in such a light it would have been an adequate little thriller. Adequate, but no more. As it was, and plainly a copy of something so superior; it fell rather flat. That is not a criticism of Sly Stallone. He was very well cast as a brutal, avenging hit-man, a sort of Rambo-in-a-suit. Other players also did their best, especially Mickey Rourke and of course Micheal Caine - who starred in the original. There were some clever camera takes: split-screen and flash forwards, and a dull, dark noirish look that also vaguely echoed the original. Car chases likewise reflected those on Tyneside, but this time Fir trees replaced the outstretched washing-lines as a foil of visionary obstruction. There were even views of decaying industrial wasteland. But something special was missing. And it's hard to say exactly what. Some of the lines came straight out of the first movie, and left one half expecting the same scenarios to follow, when instead there was something else, lending a sense of confused dejavu - and sadly, disappointment. The conversations seemed to drag-on needlessly. They indulged the characters but failed to move the story along. And each contained more than a fair share of recriminatory clichés. I actually found myself muting them with the remote control - not a good sign. I certainly wouldn't dream of doing that with the original. Let's face it; you couldn't. The original script was so spartan and terse you'd miss some relevant detail. Perhaps that's where it failed. Nearly 40 years on, the sex-n-violence depicted in the first movie still appeared to be toned-down in order to appease the mainstream mid-Atlantic palate. American directors seem to believe that their audiences need motives to be fully explained and emotions climactically choreographed, whereas Britains don't. Maybe we're more violent as a people. Quentin Tarantino doesn't waste time in this way, and I suspect that if he had masterminded the project it would have been a genuine classic and worthy successor to the Carter laurels. As it was, I confess to losing interest altogether about three-quarters of the way through and just going to bed. If you haven't seen the British original (then, boy, you're in for a treat) or you're a Sly Stallone fan, maybe you'll have a different perspective. Though I would still counsel against sitting down with a 6-pack as I suspect you'll likely be joining me in the land or nod.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I am a member of the 'boycott Hollywood for remaking classics' club, I thought give this one a shot as well. The original Get Carter was a an original British piece of great cinema which is a must for fans of the gangster genre. However after watching this version I can say that it stands out on its own as a movie although did they have to call it the same name. This time it is Hollywood hard man Sly Stallone filling the boots of Micheal Caine and in a few ways he does succeed but ultimately he just seems more accustomed to playing stereotypical Hollywood hard men rather than a tough, brooding gangster. The film wastes no time getting into the action straight away and does not really waste time going into character development as we introduced to who need to know along the way as it is a typical black ans white , good vs bad story. The music is also funky and the action is great and Sly Stallone does seem to wear a suit very well. On the other hand Get Carter fails because it is an American Hollywood spin on British classic which will not go down well with the fans, also the story is based on one of redemption and the cheesy clichéd dialogue and awkward 'bonding' moments just don't work over on this one as the characters just seem rather flat. To conclude this version of Get Carter is not a complete waste of time, just take it for what it is and don't compare to the original. Just treat it as no brain action movie although I fans of the Gangster Genre might want to check this one out still, not the best of remakes but yet again not the worst either.GET CARTER - 7.8 OUT OF 10THE TRUTH HURTS...</fullReview>

He eventually finds out the truth &amp; "adjusts" the 3 people who had a hand in his brother's murder. HOW he "adjusts" them is well, I won't tell you. You have to see the film.In his quest for vengeance, he humanely ties up some loose ends with his sister-in-law &amp; niece. Those are very touching moments in the film, giving us a Carter we can relate to. I have never seen the original Get Carter with Michael Caine in the lead so I really can't compare the two.Sly is older &amp; more tired-looking here but ya gotta love his goatee &amp; shiny suits!

		<fullReview>After having seen this about a year, maybe a year and a half ago, I couldn't remember that much of it, except that it wasn't particularly good. I've heard many say that the original '71 version is much better... believe me, I'll take your word for it, as it can't be much worse than this. Stallone can't really act, and this film shows it. The story is decent, but it never really gets the viewers interest or attention, and what you're left with is a bunch of car-chases and tough guy beating tough guy or tough guy beating weak guy fights. The plot is pretty dull, doesn't really hold your attention at all, and quickly loses your interest entirely. The acting isn't very good. The characters are pretty thin and most of them are just either tough guy clichés or weak-guy-trying-to-appear-tough clichés. The soundtrack is cool, with lots and lots of excellent techno tracks... but that's pretty much the only good thing about the film. My recommendation? Rent the soundtrack. Skip the film. For an action film, it really has little to no actual action or tension. It's all so predictable, and all of the action consists of car-chases and fighting scenes, anyway. One of the biggest reasons I watched this drab, mediocre film again was John C. McGinley. If you've read a review of mine about one of the other films I've seen which had him on the cast, then you know that I nothing short of love the guy. He's just so damn cool, and his personality works great in the film, in the character. But, alas, he has too damn little screen-time, and it's not worth sitting through the parts of the film that doesn't have him. All in all, just not really a very memorable film. The dialog tries too hard to be cool, the editing tries too hard to be stylish... the whole thing ends up as a mess. I recommend this only to very big fans of Stallone or possibly huge fans of crime-action-thrillers. Everyone else, skip this one... maybe look for the original film. It appears to be much, much better. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok- I've performed Get Carter scenes in street theatre at locations of the original, and just watched Sly's version.It's a bit like reading the book before watching the film. High praise very unlikely to follow.But it was a tale of the murky folk of the underclass- just a few more affluent ones here. What I wondered was why some violence was kept off air- like the chap Carter threw off a building and who landed on a car was not shown, whilst some bare knuckle boxing- almost like a Rocky scene without gloves -was left in.Big money boss Jeremy Kinnear was left hopelessly unprotected to Allow Carter to do what he liked to him. NO.And Carter was portrayed as a gangster who didn't have a friend in the world, but who was desparatly required back at work. Not really.But the cracker of the film had to be when Carter said to Brumby (Michael Caine [about 5'10" and 150 pounds])"You're a big man but you're out of shape- with me it's a full time job, so behave yourself"Whoever thought of getting Michael Caine to receive that classic line?!!Film almost black and white, and all of the characters didn't really have any character. Phone dumping by Carter's girl bit-on-the-side totally unnecessary and unconnected plot.Great for Stallone fans maybe. Reasonable for anyone else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An OK action thriller rates 5/10 but do not watch it if you have already seen Caine's 1971 masterpiece otherwise you will be disappointed. Stallone's Carter is a more likeable guy than Caine and the ending is different. The plot (except for the ending and locations) is very similar and the later version's production quality and affects are possibly better, its just that the portrayals of the major characters are very different. Personally, I believe that gangsters such as Carter are more effectively portrayed as _ _ seholes as in Caine's characterisation. Indeed, it may be difficult to imagine Stallone as an evil character but then again good-guy Tom Hanks managed it in the "Road To Perdition".</fullReview>

Basically, the premise (not anything you won't read before watching)is that Mr. Carter (Stallone), who plays a convincing "tough guy" comes back to investigate his brother's mysterious death, while encountering old friends, and enemies along the way, and so...plot becomes more n more interesting to watch as movie plays on.To those who post negative reviews, just want to say, its sad how people do not appreciate all the effort that the producers, directors, actors, etc put into making not only this film, but every other of Stallone's films. Most people tend to make quick judgements and assumptions, based on small little parts they find unamuzing.Stallone is one of my top three actors and will continue to be the great actor he is. Furthermore, if you are a "Sylvestor Stallone" fan, you will enjoy this movie a great deal. The producers use a different method of camera effects that I find interesting. Buy this movie!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I think it's very underrated...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...I mean, sure, Stallone isn't even close to being a great actor, but that doesn't mean every single movie that he does is bad. I think people hate this movie because they think they have to, just because ol' sly is in it. Come on, XXX got a higher IMdB user rating then this, that's not right.The plot circles around a bookie-type (Stallone) trying to find out why his brother died in a mysterious car crash. While investigating he finds that his old friend Cyrus (Mickey Rourke) and a snooty rich kid (Alan Cumming) may be involved.It's very entertaining, with cool, funny actors like Michael Caine, John C. McGinley, Mark Boone Jr., Rachel Leigh Cook and Miranda Richardson making appearances. The fight scenes are great too, really realistic boxing-like fist fights.Good movie, 7.5/10.</fullReview>

It feels like it is longer then Lord of the Rings. It is so bad with so many unexplained characters in it that i thought I was watching a high school movie project. The movie is what I like to call bad. Terrible. Trash. Dear God Sly start writing another sequel to Saturday Night Fever if you want some fans back. Yeah that will do it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a note for the directors.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok...you've read the reviews...the good, the bad...blah...blah...blah.To me, it just passed time. It was OK...nothing special. Not the best move I've ever seen...not the worst.My comments are on the locations. Being that I was in this film while it was being shot in Vancouver, I felt really cheated.The car chases and scenes where they go from downtown to chinatown and then to underneath a tunnel all in 30 seconds is too sad.As a person who drives like a nut (and I DO-even I can't make it to that many locations in such a short time period.I had a very very very hard time swallowing the car chase scenes, simply because with daytime traffic as it is in any major city (Seattle especially-because of it's layout)there is always major gridlock, but somehow the chase never seems to stop in traffic. The drivers can just whip around any other cars and be gone with...all while staying on blacktop and not mowing people down.That really p***ed me off...as a driver myself (a professional) why can Inot manage to swoop around cars when I'm in a rush without having people jump infront of me or cops round the corner?How acurate is a gunman when driving at 80 miles an hour through city streets and swaying back and forth? Pathetic!!! Really. The car chase from point A point B to point C would've taken at least 25 minutes at a ridiculously high speed in the actual city...not even considering that Seattle and Vancouver / New Westminster are even almost 2 1/2 hours (at my driving speed) away. And in that time...nobody called the cops because there was a shootout playing infront of them. Everybody has cellphones now!!! Come on..crazy people blasting away in the intersection will definately send the red and white sirens wailing down the roads.Then point to note at the golf club...money doesn't always allow anybody into private clubs...no matter how much is flashed infront of their eyes. Not everybody is bought of so easily. They may accept the money, but...still alert others to what is going on. (As a former club owner...anybody who would see a gun drawn would alert others and the place would vacate...very fast.)I look past the acting in this movie...past the senseless shootings, bad dialogue and physical abuse because I know that is purposely done...but it's the simple things like car chases and paying people off and the party scenes where guns are drawn and fights ensue and the music still plays and people dance and drink and nobody gives a shit (in other words...the building could crash and burn around them and the dancers will still be partying...that's whats get me.)There will be many more reviews afterward about the acting...screw the acting...think of the little things that don't make sense...because the acting (which I found ok for the type of script) is a mere part of what makes the entire structure stupid or good.And anybody who has films shot in their town knows when a certain neighbourhood across town is shown and then downtown and then other end and then all over the bloody place and then back again all in under 2 minutes is really pathetic the the residents of the city who will watch this film.Because the one thing we can't relate to as viewers is the total lack of structure there is when car chases are involved...we drive the same roads too...and we encounter bike couriers, schoolkids, animals, buses, red lights, stops signs, busy intersections, construction, cops, slow drivers, fogged up windows on a rainy day with defrosters that take 5 minutes to clean up, vehicle problems...etcNext time I leave my house and drive down the same roads in Chinatown, I want to be in downtown Seattle in 30 seconds too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great return by Sly!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now don't listen to the idiots who bashed this movie...this is a terrific return by Sly Stallone. This movie works because of several reasons: a great cast (especially Stallone, Michael Caine &amp; Rachel Leigh Cook), a great story (actually better than the original) &amp; a great location (the original was in London, but this version takes place in Seattle). Stallone play Jack Carter, who returns to Seattle for his brother's funeral. But not everything is as it seems; it's obvious that Ritchie Carter (Jack's brother), was murdered. But it gets more complexed...just *HOW* many people are involved. The movie is very ingrossing, &amp; Sly gives a strong performance as a tough-as-nails guy who eventually begins growing a softer side when developing a relationship with his niece. A terrific soundtrack by Tyler Bates &amp; Jellybean Benitez help set the mood.</fullReview>

Its a little weird at times and some of the music was pretty cheesy but it had some good car chases and Sly gave a pretty good performance. This movie is one of the actors better films, its not as good as CLIFFHANGER or FIRST BLOOD but its definitely better than TANGO &amp; CASH.

		<shortDescription>Very long and boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was made when Stallone wanted to start being considered an 'actor'. This was sadly when Stallone joined the long list of action heroes to move away from mainstream releases, like Jean-Claude Van Damme, Dolph Lundgren, and of course, Arnie. The movie is infact a remake of a '70s movie starring Michael Caine of the same title. But whatever good intentions this film has it loses quickly, as the film is incredibly slow-moving and boring. I can appreciate Sly trying to act, but he really must learn that people don't go to see him in 'acting' roles, they go to se him kick butt. The action in this film consists of Sly beating people up and looking hard. Not even Mickey Rourke can make anything of this mess. Note to Sly; if you wanna stay in the game, stick to pure action! I'm going to see D-Tox to see if it's any better.</fullReview>

Pointless, absolutely pointless and difficult to sit through. "The Limey" was a better remake of the original "Get Carter", though I believe Dobbs and Soderbergh might cringe at the idea of "The Limey" being a remake. But really, when you look at the plot, "The Limey" is a remake and far superior to this little monster. Also, listen to the way the remake is scored and compare it to Budd's original - night and day. Heck, compare it to the Limey's score... Just another display of Hollywood's complete disregard for film on levels - except as a potential money maker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How about a different view.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****WARNING, THIS CONTAINS SLIGHT SPOILERS****While there appears the many who jump on the "I hate Sly" bandwagon, I want to offer a different view on this movie. Admittedly I don't dislike Stallone, but I wouldn't go so far as to say that he's an amazing actor. I do however think that he is capable of more than most people seem to think. My interest in this show however is more based on the style and the story. As far as visuals are concerned, I thought that this movie was very well composed. The film follows Jack's investigation, the budding relationship between he and his niece Doreen (Rachael Leigh Cook in an excellent performance,) and the knowledge that his brother was murdered after discovering that Doreen was raped by his co-worker. As Jack's world comes crashing down, the cinematography changes, adding more tension. One thing that this movie has over other action/Stallone films is heart. At the heart of the story, we see a man who made choices that injured his relationship with his family, and now he's trying to make a change for the better. I thought that this movie received very poor critiques. I don't think that everyone has to like it, but don't automatically rule it out because it's a Sylvester Stallone Movie. Also, in light of another comment, Doreen was supposed to be drugged, raped, and under-age in the movie. The idea is that she didn't volunteer to have sex, and if you'd watch the movie with sound you would hear her trying to fight back during the rape scene. My rating - ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm normally pretty lenient when it comes to films, and even though Crime (Drama) movies are some of my favorites, this one was just too boring and too slow for me.There was supposedly a story to this movie, but it's such a cookie cutter plot, that even when there is some actual dialogue (it seems as if a lot of this movie is just us watching Sylvester Stallone (somewhat) quietly "investigate") it feels as if they just took a generic script and used mad libs to make it "new".I don't know why this is described as an Action movie (except for the lack of a real plot, dialogue, etc.), as there aren't actually very many fights or action scenes in this movie and even when there are, they are wholly unspectacular and totally forgettable. This as an action movie is about right up there along side "Look Who's Talking Now"...To end, if you have the choice of watching this movie late at night, don't, unless you happen to need a non-prescription method of getting to sleep faster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stallone returns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The minute I seen the trailer for this movie and I seen Stallone I knew I had to see this movie. Althought it isn't like the days of Rambo or Cobra where everything in site is filled with lead it still packs on heck of a punch. This movie also marks the return of the long last action movie one liner which Stallone was the master at you just have to laugh to yourself when the guy at the gate asks if he is on the list and Stallone punches him out and says " No one likes the list guy." Alright this movie circles around the life of Jack Carter, a tough guy of a hitman who doesn't take no crap from anyone. After coming home for his brothers funeral he suspects nothing is really what it seems and decides to investigate. But soon gets himself in deeper than even he can handle. The film also stars Rachel Leigh Cook and Michael Caine (star of the original Get Cater). The movie has Stallone at his personal best giving one of his greatest performances, I guess now that he is older he has decided to stop shooting everything and give acting a try and to his success might I add. This is a serious movie but it is still fun just watching Stallone walk around punching, kicking and even conducting one hell of a great car chase without even breaking a sweat. This is pure trashy, action filled entertainment at its best, as a matter of fact it could just be the best action movie of 2000. Not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this film is under-appreciated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS So many people hate this movie. They hate it because they hate Stallone. They hate it because they're such big fans of the original cult classic. They hate it because... they have no taste in movies. I've seen the original, and I respect the original, and I liked the original, but this is a very good remake, and a well done movie on its own.As the previous review stated, Stallone's acting is top notch, and those people who only see him as he was in "Tango &amp; Cash" and "Judge Dredd" need to remember that he was also in the "Rocky" series and "First Blood" which all required good acting. In this, he comes across as a character who is tough for a living, not because he necessarily is tough, but because he has to be, and underneath he is a real person with real human emotions. But a tough man in a tough underworld can't let others know he even has emotions, so it stays buried... and yet, we know he cares. An excellent performance by Stallone.The supporting cast is just as good, with Michael Caine (who plays Carter in the original), Rachel Leigh Cook (who proves in this movie she's more than just another cute teen), Miranda Richardson who is as strong as ever, Mickey Rourke, (finally getting good material he can work with), and Alan Cumming, who (besides Stallone) stole the movie. Alan Cumming is incredible... (see "Titus" or "Anniversary Party" to see what I mean).What really makes this movie to me though, is its style. The grainy look making it feel somehow more real and less like a movie. The use of light is amazing, and when added to by the quick jerky editing, creates an interesting and almost paranoid look, similar to the recently released "Insomnia" from director Christopher Nolan. (And, despite what most critics say, there ARE ways of doing jerky cuts and quick editing and still make a movie that isn't compared to a music video or a Superbowl commercial. It's all in the director. David Fincher was slammed by critics when "Se7en" first came out, and everyone said he was just another MTV guy making his break into Hollywood. Now critics everywhere respect him and hold him up as one of the most original and innovative new filmmakers... see?) I really hope that director Steven Kay doesn't have second thoughts about doing anything else just because fans of the original bashed this one all to pieces, because I'd like to see what else he'd do. Even the use of the camera, for instance: a shot of Stallone sitting in a car while everything is going wrong. Instead of inserting some kind of corny dialogue or, even worse, doing nothing and quickly cutting to another scene to keep a fast pace, the shot just literally turns upside down. Very easy, not much high tech wizardry needed or special effects to make a point come across, the director opts to just turn our perspective of the world upside down so we can identify with the character. Good stuff. Simple, but effective.For those who have heard of the movie, but haven't had the guts to go see it because all you've heard is bad stuff... don't listen to THEM! This movie is very well done, I think even better than the original, because this 'version' decides right from the get-go that it's not going to be just another action movie where some guy goes around beating everybody up to get revenge. I don't even hold that it's and action movie at all, more like a suspense-drama with a faster heart-rate. It's about the search for truth and redemption, and the price all of those involved will pay while finding it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was released in the US in October 2000. Its performance at the box office was a catastrophe and the reviews ripped the film apart. As yet, there has been no release date planned for the UK. Being a resident in England and Sly fan AND hearing this kind of news was not encouraging.So when i see a copy of Get Carter out on video release in a video store in the Emirates on my hols, i immediately grab the tape not thinking of all the doom and gloom attached to it.I sat down with great foreboding at the start of the movie. How shocked I was. The film has an excellent opening with a superbly cool soundtrack and excellent visuals.Suddenly all was ok in Sly world!Sly plays Jack Carter- a mafia thug/tough guy- who returns to his hometown upon the death of his brother.There he reunites with his brothers wife and daughter. Carter is convinced his brother did not die in the accident the police report claimed but that he was murdered, but by whom. Carter sets about to find out in his own way, but with every new piece of information he finds, he delves deeper into the seedy world he left behind.I enjoyed the movie as a whole, some weak elements i.e. carters reason to go back to his home town is weak and even the script hits on that, but there needed to be more explanation. The ending, whilst quite good, could have had more impact. Where the film scored was in the music, the visuals and a good performance from Sly and the actress who played his neice.Again,as with D-tox and Driven and a whole load of movies, Sly was ripped apart by the critics. But rent it and make your own decisions!!I rate it 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK so the big mistake was calling it Get Carter - that in its self is enough to get peoples backs up, but if you forget about that and give the film a chance it will actually surprise you.This film is not for everyone, and I especially think the US market wont get this film at all because there is no defined good guy, the story isn't blockbuster big and the cars don't blow up when they crash (I am sure in the US they believe all cars explode on impact!)This film really reminds me of a good French thrillers. It is a slow building movie but after a fairly weak 30 minutes turns into a very good movie.Stallone is actually excellent again, proving Copland was not a fluke. His acting of Jack Carter is spot on and in his performance he keeps the paranoia of the 70's movie going.This is a film that I truly recommend, not because it is Stallone and not because it is called Get Carter but because it is actually a good film if you give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think Stallone had more make-up on in this film, then the entire cast of "Moulin Rouge"....and what's with the goatee? was it real? in fact, was Stallone himself real in this film, or was it a hologram. Yeah, well i was asking myself the same questions throughout this film. I still have this strange attraction to Stallone's recent output...am i a victim of guilty pleasures? The original get carter is one of my absolute favourites, it had a raw central intensity to it. but this tepid, uninspired remake is akin to what "the assassin" is to the far superior original, "nikita". There are so many things i couldnt figure out, if Carter was so detached from his brother, why did he bother to avenge his death so badly? why not pay the guy some mind while he's alive. Rachel leigh cook, was awesome in this film, she is the bomb, probably her best performance, although i think in a few scenes she was sickering at Stallone's wardrobe (another major debit). Mickey Rourke was totally believable in this role, i especially loved the scene where he's explaining how dope the internet is to Stallone and how he is "swimming in the pond with the big fish" or some baloney. I nearly died laughing. The director's commentary is horrendously bad on the DVD, as Stephen Kay barely talks, (maybe a good thing), i think he should go back to delivering pizza. Lets hope this movie wont be made into a franchise (a la "Death Wish"), with Stallone avenging the deaths of anyone he remotely knew. At least this was better than "Driven". YO ADRIAN!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasantly surprised</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't see this film in a movie theater since I thought it would be a waste of my time and money. After "First Blood" I have felt that Mr. Stallone's movies were awful with the noticeable exception of "Cliffhanger" that gave a decent suspension. Now I saw this one on DVD to kill time but was pleasantly surprised. The script was good, the music hip, editing classy, directing great and the acting... well surprisingly good. Sly kept his cool and focus on the role for except the scene where he starts to cry hearing his niece's story that he already knew. Understandably he cared for her but it got too emotional since he had only known her for 48 hours. Somehow it was not convincing but not bad either. Even Rourke was good as the bad guy. The action scenes were promising but somehow lacked convincing details to tell you how "A" got to be "C" since "B" was never shown, if you catch my drift. Overall it was a fairly strong movie with slow, realistic progression and turnouts. This is the best acting I have seen from Sylvester Stallone and I hope he will continue on this streak. He is maturing as an actor and given a good script he is starting to prove himself in a new way. Congratulations - 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, Ok this film has been slated by many amatuer and professional critics. I believe there is only one reason for this. They watched it comparing it to the original.The movie on its own stands itself very well in modern cinema. It had a complex story, very well acted out by all the players and the characters were very well choreographed (bar Alan Cumming as Jeremy Kinnear).The original is still way out in front, however I feel that natural comparison has lead to this movie being judged too quickly by too many.The action and story line were fast paced and the dialogue was very well constructed. As I have said the only downpoint was Jeremy Kinnear. In the original novel that the film was based on, Kinnear was a sharp, brutal and very dangerous gangster. Jeremy Kinnear in this movie came across as a bit of wet blanket.All in all though, a good movie. A 'love it or hate it' movie no doubt, but please judge it for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like this film. I saw the original with Michael Caine as Carter, and I think this later version is different enough, and entertaining enough to stand on its own. The action moves right along and the plot almost keeps up.Sylvester Stallone is simply excellent. He does some of his best work in films like this one, and here he was flawless. Someone else to watch, in her brief appearances, is Rhona Mitra. She masters her role and creates a compelling, memorable character. I really like her style. She is also one of the most beautiful actresses in existence.Everyone in the film brings additional depth and interest. I like to find a reason to watch a film and enjoy it. In this film it is the cast and performances. Rachel Leigh Cook, Mickey Rourke, and always Michael Caine, are all well worth watching here.I was not enamored of the way the action was portrayed. The sharp scene changes were often confusing. I really do not care for the "shaky camera" technique of portraying violent action. There was too much of that. The fight scene between Stallone and Rourke should have been thrilling, but it was wasted time; and amateurishly done. I think the director was the big flaw in this film. He imparts a style and intensity overall, but falls down on the details."Get Carter" is certainly worth seeing and enjoying, for the blend of ambience, photography, music, action, and most of all, the stellar performances of the entire cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankly "Cop Land" was the first movie that made me think Sly IS an actor who can act differently, he IS able to give a different taste than the one he gave in "First Blood" and "Rocky" series. This thought made me watch "Get Carter" which was a disappointment, because it gave me a certain "ROCKY CAME BACK" feeling. His make-up did not help to change this image nor did the small parts of Mickey Rourke (which was too repetitious!), and Michael Caine. I think the best thing about this movie is the production crew who made a work of art out of a hopeless script, and worn faces.</fullReview>

Hogan consumed a large part of the budget due to extensive effects make up which isn't very convincing anyway. Paul Hogan's lip-synching is also rather dubious. The major love scene in the movie between Hogan and Bridget Nielsen is very tastelessly shot especial Hogan's wrinkly man-breasts.

Rachael Leigh Cook saved the film(as she does with most of her films, even if she is only in a fifteen or so minute scene like "Naked Man"). The best scene is the one where her character,"Doreen", reveals a troubling secret. I felt she should have been nominated for at least a Golden Globe for that scene alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this and sat down to give my rating for the film and was shocked to see how low the ratings were. Normally my rating is pretty close to the average - I gave the film a 7 out of 10 and as of 3/25/01 the weighted average was 4.9. I thought the film was worthy of a "go see" rating at least.First, Sly gave a good performance. Real solid. I think he is a very intelligent man - a good writer and actor (go watch "Rocky" if you have any doubts, he wrote and starred in it). IMO he was completely convincing as a Las Vegas strong-arm type. At the same time he gave a touching performance for his scenes with the character's niece. He does have a limited range as an actor - not due to any limitation on his part, but the audience will only allow him to play certain types of characters. Orson Welles, a pretty fine actor, revealed that he had a similar range problem in his BBC interview - he called himself a "King Actor". A "King Actor" is a reference to a group of actors in historical theater that only played Kings. This type of person has an acting presence that draws such attention to it that if put into weaker roles would discombobulate the scene. I think Sly has the same problem - he is a "King Actor". So, he has to play certain types of roles - but he is quite good in them. "Get Carter" is one; "Cliffhanger" and "Rocky" are others. I think he would be great in a Quentin Tarantino movie.Second, the direction and editing was interesting and fit the tone of the film (the editor has some pretty fine credits, including "French Connection" and "Kramer v. Kramer"). I liked the color - the filters and processing gave the film a feeling that fit well with the Seattle setting and the subject of the film. The special touches the editing style used that put the audience in the first person with Sly's character was clever and interesting.Third, the supporting cast was excellent. Miranda Richardson, Mickey Rourke, Rachael Leigh Cook, Alan Cunning, Michael Caine. Need I say more? They all performed up to their reputation and were all convincing. If talent were the criteria, each one of the actors I list as supporting could easily carry their own films. Fourth - the music was great!This won't make my top ten for the year - but I could definitely see it again and I don't hesitate on recommending it. A good solid film! I don't know what the others have against it - perhaps an antagonism for Sylvester Stallone (who knows) - but don't listen to them. Go see it. This is a good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sylvester Stallone has disappointed the world again with his latest film, "Get Carter" because it is so dreary and dry. In no uncertain terms, "Get Carter" had no reason to be made. I don't understand why so many talented actors signed up to participate in a movie that drains the life out of you."Get Carter" is a one dimensional failure that tries to pass itself off as an action film. While this is called an action film, there is absolutely zero action; furthermore, the story is so dull and unimaginative, I couldn't wait until it was over. There are many things I found wrong with "Get Carter." For example, even though the plot was so boring and dull, I wanted to give this film a shot. The second thing that bothered me was the movie seemed to put me to sleep because it ran out of ideas to talk about within the first 45 minutes. After the first 45 minutes, the ideas seemed to be recycled. "Get Carter" was such a boring film, I took several naps because I could not see relatively good actors in a wasted film. The worst thing about "Get Carter" was the fact that the performances by each actor was translucent and seemed to be very shallow. I have to question the production companies why they decided to waste their time and money on a movie that obviously had no reason to be made.Overall, "Get Carter" is the worst action film made in 2000.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am one of the few people who actually believe Stallone is talented. There's no doubt when you watch Rocky. But it's his bad choices in scripts and poor performances in them, that give him such a bad name. Get Carter is just another horrible movie in a long line of horrible movies for Stallone. He mumbles his way through this one (I had to keep raising the volume throughout), gazing off in the distance half the time, making sure he's got some strands of hair hanging down his forehead. This film is just unbearable. The plot is hard to follow and every performance is bad. Worst of all, the direction in the film is terrible. For the life of me, I can't figure out how or why this film was made. I wanted to like it, but it was impossible. At some point, some studio exec is going to realize that Stallone is not worth 20 mil a picture. If he's not doing straight to video films in there years, I'd be surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it's not action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually liked this one. It has an interesting visual construction, which has to do, i think, with coherent photography and specially editing. It's visual storytelling in the sense that, the plot, though thin and relatively uninteresting is fully told visually. No devices including those common excessive dialogues used to overcome the lack of visual devices. As a positive thing here i see the global artistic coherence, in boards built almost as a mosaic.But this is very hated project. Why? i have a theory. The public enjoys Stallone because he performs 9 out of 10 times the typical American hero. Such as his other fellow colleagues like Seagall, Van Damme, Scwarzenegger (these two were American imports). More recently, this part is probably being played by Vin Diesel. So Stallone earned his recognition among fans of franchised heroes such as Rambo or Balboa. Those characters don't show too much here. It's still a typical "kill everybody" revenge plot, but very softened by the way things were visually put together. So the problem (for the success of the film) in my opinion was: starring Stallone, the film was immediately calling for fans of those kinds of commercial productions, aimed at beating up the audiences with tales of heroism, revenge, physical action and higher old fashioned moral (the American ego calls it "american values"). Here we have none of that. Instead we have relatively intelligent and sensitive cinematic visual construction. But the audiences prepared for those experiments probably didn't feel the need to watch this one. I suppose that was the thing here.So, i think this is worth taking a look, it's relatively interesting int the way it edits in coherence with the plot, it is all made in a highly visual way. In fact, we come to find out the "truth" of the facts in the plot through a film inside the film. We watch that film, together with Stallone, so once more, through a device planned to choose image as the medium.My opinion: 3/5 a mildly interesting cinematic experiment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are going to watch this you either need to have a barf bag ready or a gun to kill yourself for being so stupid.Remakes are a big warning sign that Hollywood has run out of ideas. They seldom work, and, even if they are good, they are unfavorably compared with the original. Don't tell me about The Departed. It isn't even close to being as good as the original.Now, having said that, why in the world would you want to do a remake with Sylvester Stallone? You already have two strikes against you and you just let the pitcher have a freebie.I loved Cop Land, and that is probably the best he will ever do. It called for someone that was five beers short of a six pack emotion-wise. Here you have a guy seeking revenge for his brother and you see that same lack of emotion. Why bother? It did have Miranda Richardson (Tom &amp; Viv, Damage) and the lovely Rhona Mitra and Sir Michael Caine in a wasted role. No other reason to watch except for a dynamite car chase.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This one remake is worth the watch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember the 1971 version of "Get Carter", well this version of it I would say I like the best. At both versions have one thing in common, Michael Caine. Unlike the first one, Sly Stallone is the main character, Jack Carter. His look for the movie is way cool, and I like the way he handled things. When the details were of the underground world, no one handles the problems the way Carter does. There's plenty of car chases, shooting, and of course killing some, Carter does all that. In this version of the movie Michael Caine plays the character Cliff Brumby. I think it's fair enough that the original star should have his place in a remake. I know why the critics put down this movie so hard. To me, I wouldn't let get to me, for the way I see it, I enjoyed it very well. Making the promises is always something for everyone to keep, Carter doesn't back out or down to anything. This is one remake I think is very good, I see what I like, and everything else is good entertainment. Rating 4 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I got into it!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the original on TV years ago when I was a kid. The movie had to be edited down for TV viewing, because some of it was too graphic. The film was dark, noir and a bit Avant garde. Caine's acting was creepy and strangely sadistic and evil. Yet it was a bit hard to accept Caine as a tough guy.Stallone rebounds in this thoughtful remake. He's a different kind of actor than Caine, perhaps not as eloquent, but definitely more convincingly tough. Sly's Carter has a heart, soft spot so to speak. Caine's Carter was a sadistic pig with barely any redeeming quality. Both versions work in their own way, however. But I'm glad Sly chose this project. See both versions for yourself and decide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe I should watch it again....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really don't want to though. I'm now 21 and when I watched it, I was 18, I think. Maybe I was too young to appreciate it and maybe I shouldn't have watched it with my mate as we might have been speaking too much and not concentrating enough. Whatever the reason, I doubt I'd rate it much higher this time around and I'd prefer to watch the original. I do not dislike Stallone. I think given half the chance, he can actually act quite well. His problem is being typecast but he's rich, so he gets the last laugh in the end. Another thing is that I only rate this low, once in a blue moon but I genuinely felt this film had terribly little to offer. Rachel Leigh Cook was decent and so was Sly, funnily enough. Can't remember too much about Mickey Rourke except how his career had been pretty down hill at that point in time. As somebody else wrote; "this film is just a crashing bore."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Get Carter (2000) is awful. The plot is so thin, the running time of this movie should have been less than an hour, instead of an hour and 45 minutes. Maybe if Stallone actually spoke English instead of constantly mumbling in a low monotone, it would have been possible to figure out what was going on. The basic plot is, Stallone finds out his estranged brother has died in a car accident, goes to his funeral, and concludes that his brother has been murdered. He decides to stick around and dispense some frontier justice. Why he decides to investigate instead of going to the police, is never explained. Why the brother's family doesn't investigate either, is also not explained. Why one character who claims to be a Harvard graduate acts as if he has the IQ of a frog, is also not explained. Get the picture? Unless you are a die-hard Stallone fan, don't rent this video. Even if you are a Stallone fan, be advised that (in my opinion) this is one of his worst efforts.</fullReview>

The tough-little-puppy-that's-just-been-beaten-but-is-still-ready-to-face-the-wo rld mask Stallone hides behind throughout this timewaster wears thin all too quickly. If it weren't for the car chases and crashes, sleep would have mercifully shortened this experience. How is it that a guy who has bucks to burn can't come up with a better film? The Rocky mystique is over Sly ... it's time to either create some decent cinema or get out of the game. Please, no more disappointments like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is considerably worse than Battlefield Earth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is, to date, the worst movie I have ever seen. Most bad movies have at least a little bit of campy value, but not this one. It's way too somber. Stallone really gives off an ugly impression in this movie; I'm sure he's a very nice guy in real life, but after watching him here, I have an acute desire to NEVER see him in a movie again. Anyone who praises this movie for it's style should go watch FIGHT CLUB or RUN LOLA RUN again and come back later, since the MTV-tricks in that movie had a purpose. Not here. Was I the only one thinking "what the hell?" when the director skipped frames or put the film on fast forward speed. Totally unnecessary. The more I think about it, the more GET CARTER really does resemble BATTLEFIELD EARTH. Both movies have minimal yet messy plots, not to mention horribly edited action sequences. The difference is that at least BE had John Travolta and Forrest Whitaker hamming it up and having a good time despite the all-around stupidity of the script. Here, everyone takes the movie DEADLY SERIOUS. This isn't fun at all, it's just boring and agonizing. After seeing the movie, I knew that Stallone fans everywhere would be severely let down, and while most of them were, I'm surprised that there are people out there who actually like this garbage. If you own this movie on video or DVD right now, I have to ask, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!?!?!?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.IMDB comments often interest me. The consensus here is that this is a bad film. And although I had yet to find a Stallone film I could tolerate, I actually like this one. Strange to swim against popular opinion and support the nitwit.That's because his other stuff is there only to support him, whatever he is. Here, the film is a visual tapestry that uses him merely as a token. (He plays a gangster who is unknowingly playing a film gangster.)So the quality of the tapestry is what matters and what appeals to me. There's nothing original here: `Limey' has more adventure in the perspective-shifting; `Professional' has more charm in the character; `Payback,' despite other flaws has deeper reference to prior work; `Snatch,' though thin stuff elsewise has more energy.But this has more coherent visual art. What I want first from a film is to transport me to another world. Kay, Fiore and Greenberg do this. My real struggle with this film is how close it comes to the simple craft of pumping out a pop vision, close to a practiced commercial for instance. It's close and one doesn't want to cut Sly any slack, but it still works for me.At the bottom of this film is another small self-reference: it is about another film, the rape. Another funny thing: the only actor that doesn't work for me is, gasp, Caine. The music during the action stinks.</fullReview>

And if your niece was raped and had no father to comfort her, you would cry too. He is human, and this movie shows that side of him. To me, there was not an non suspenseful part of this movie. I had never seen the original. I suppose hitting bit torrent and finding it wouldn't be a bad idea. I liked the cast of characters, I also liked the fact for a movie that came out in 2000, the cell phones weren't huge and clunky. As far as the goof, with his car not being damaged, that is crap.

		<shortDescription>The best Stallone movie ever!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And by that, I mean probably the only one he actually acts in.I'm not really a fan of Sly's. Yeah, I've watched his films over the years, all the rocky's, all the Rambo's (First Blood was best but despite seeing it about 6 times I still cannot make out what he says at the end of the film), Daylight, Cobra, Nighthawks, Judge Dredd, Cliffhanger, Demolition Man and a few others. The point I'm making is that I will watch him, but I won't go out of my way or pay good money to do so. I basically find most of his stuff just run of the mill.The original "Get Carter" was and is one of my favourite all time films, it being released about the time I became an adult, so I never went out of my way to watch this version (The same could be said for another Caine film remade, "The Italian Job" - I'll maybe watch it if it's on TV and there is nothing else, but aside from that, no).Anyway, the Stallone "Get Carter" was on TV last night, and as I usually do with films like this, I set the video so I could watch it later, or not watch it later if it turns out to be rubbish. I watched it this morning because I had a few hours to kill, and I was surprised. Now nothing is going to compare with the original as far as I'm concerned, and side by side, the original wins hands down, but as a stand alone movie - and a stand alone Stallone movie to boot - I must admit I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed it thoroughly. I genuinely think it's the best film Sly has ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a wimpy revenge movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The message of the original "Get Carter" is that revenge is sweet. The message of this remake is that revenge doesn't work. Hmm. Talk about changing your source material...The first movie is tougher in other respects as well. Michael Caine has phone sex in that movie, whereas here, Stallone has a sensitive, long-distance chat with his girlfriend. The original Carter kills everyone who was even remotely connected with his brother's death, whereas the sensitive new version spares lives. The old movie takes place in the gritty and rain-soaked streets of Newcastle, whereas this one is set in glossy Seattle, which is about as atmospheric and menacing as the average Starbuck's interior.Everything about this remake is inferior. When Caine takes off Ian Hendry's glasses in the first film, it's a very intimate, very threatening moment. Here, we get Stallone politely asking Rourke to remove his specs, then botching the subsequent insult ("piss holes in the snow" makes more sense to me than "cat piss in the snow"). The only element that's better developed here is Carter's relationship with Doreen, but even that element feels unsubtle and false.And good God, can there be a more annoying actor in the world than Alan Cumming? The best thing I ever saw him in was the bloody "Airzone Solution!"Please do me a favor...rent the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Get Carter, the Sylvester Stalone movie, was possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. The whole thing of Carter wanting revenge for his brother's mysterious death was a joke! Who cares? The story didn't go in depth about there relationship at all. And Rachael Leigh Cook as Carter's niece was ridiculous! The Bill Gates wannabe (Alan Cumming) was one of the worst interpitations of a computer genious I've seen to date, (including Tim Robbins as Bill Gates). The directing was a joke. Why did Warner Bros. fund this film? Rachael Leigh Cook could have saved the film, but her character was so discrete, and unknown. Mickey Rourke, (which, who I usually like-Bullet) was horrible in this film, and his character was badly written. Sylvester Stalone showed that he could be possibly one of the worst actors in our time (except for in the movie Rocky). I recommend that you skip this pointless film about revenge of a lost brother. 1-10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this version of Get Carter and the original, I think they are both good in their own way. I don't think you can hate the new version and like the old version. They are both so similar that you can't hate the new one. You can prefer the old to the new though. Personally I like the new Get Carter more. I thought the original was good though. Michael Caine was good in his way. Sly Stallone was good in his own way.The Stallone remake of Get Carter could've been a lot better. It is really the director's fault if it was weak. You can blame the writer too. Some lines were pretty lousy. I think it is safe to say that the directing and writing wasn't very good. You can blame them, but you can not blame Stallone. He did the best he could with what he got. I think he was perfect for this kind of Jack Carter. Not a dark one, but a good one. Stallone's Carter is one that is trying to do something right for once in his life. All his life he was a bad guy on the wrong side of the tracks, but now he's going home and he's trying to make things right. Like Caine's Carter, he's not leaving until he finds out who killed his brother. No matter what, he's going to make sure they pay.Then when he finds out what happened to his niece that really sets him off and drives him even further. Everyone responsible for the murder of Richie and rape of Doreen is going to pay. I found that scene on the rooftop with Jack and his niece to be very touching. He was telling her how it wasn't her fault and Rachel Leigh Cook really did come off as a girl that was raped.People have a problem with Jack living in the end of this one. But what they don't realize is, Get Carter is like a western. The stranger rides in to town, makes the bad guys pay and then rides off into the sunset when his work is done. It makes you feel a lot better knowing that Jack made all of the bad guys pay and finally found redemption in the end. I hated the ending to the original because of how it just came out of nowhere. It made no sense. It was almost like they put that in there because they were forced into it. Michael Caine's Jack Carter did wrong and he still had to pay for it. Michael Caine did show in one scene that his Jack did have a heart. When he sees Doreen being raped in that porn film, you can see him shedding tears. Stallone did not shed tears in the new version, but at that point he was angry and out for blood. He did get a little emotional on the rooftop with Doreen though. In the Caine version he never does see Doreen again. There was more of a relationship between Jack and Doreen and I liked that. In the new version you also got to see where Richie's wife and daughter were coming from when Jack shows up after years. I never did get that feeling in the original. I liked this movie and I think if people give it a chance they will like it too. The director and writer did almost ruin it. If not for the whole foundation of the story and for Sylvester Stallone, the movie wouldn't be good. Personally I like Sylvester Stallone. When you see his wonderful Rocky movies you can tell the guy's got some heart. I never will forget him for making those Rocky movies that I grew up watching and loving. Some day I would like to meet Sylvester Stallone. By no means is this movie as good as Stallone's classics. But it is almost as good as his decent action movies that came out in the 90's. This movie isn't up there with Rambo IV. But if Sylvester Stallone had directed this movie and wrote it, it could've been a hell of a lot better. Stallone has been approached to star in and direct a Death Wish remake. You have no reason to worry if it happens. Stallone will be in the director's chair this time. Not Stephen Kay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plodding, uninspired and surprisingly tame ? distracting but no more than that (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When his brother dies in a car accident and is ruled to have been drunk-driving, Jack Carter doesn't totally buy it. Flying back into town for the funeral, Carter starts asking around to find out if his brother was involved in anything he shouldn't have been ? convinced that someone killed him and only made it look like an accident. Going to boss Cliff Brumby, Carter gets CCTV footage of the bar on the fateful night and also makes a connection to his brother's lover Geraldine. However the more progress he makes the more attention he gets.Standing in the shadow of the original was always going to mean that this film was seen as a bad idea by a lot of people. Of course the film doesn't help itself by, remake or not, being lacklustre, predictable and plodding. Visually the film is actually pretty good and on this level alone I think that Kay should be able to churn out formulaic American action movies as well as anyone else. However in regards all other aspects of his delivery he cannot do much despite the fact that the basic story does have potential. It should have been tough, complex, emotional and engaging but on all fronts it falls down. The heart of the story is Doreen, but the film makes a mess of her relationship with Carter ? we never care about her and it hurts the film. This failure takes away from the impact the material could have made and left something that lacks heart and just feels like it was going through the motions for the majority of the time. Even in the area of being tough it fails: it talks the talk but we never see anything or experience anything ? a fact shown all the way to the ending, which is indeed an act of cowardice and commercial fear if ever I saw one.The cast are partly to blame as well as Kay. Stallone does his usual stuff and his inability to give his character any personality at all means that the whole film just drags along with a big chunk of meat on the screen ? not a man. Cook tries hard but she doesn't convince and her key failing is the fact that she relates her rape as if it was an annoyance to her as opposed to an event that took her respect and her father. Richardson is a non-entity; Caine yet again proves that you can never have too much money, but it is annoying to see him lacking respect for his own work in this way. McGinley seems to be in a different film for the most part and is totally superfluous to requirements while Rourke, Cumming and others just read their lines and add little. Of course the main failing in the cast is the lifeless turn from Stallone who kills off the story before it has even begun.Overall a plodding and dull film that had potential with a good story but totally fails to deliver on it. Lacking an emotional impact, a genuine toughness, performances and audience involvement this is not awful but it is certainly nothing more than distracting and, to be honest, it probably won't even do that for many viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GET CARTER / (2000) **1/2 (out of four)By Blake French:Hollywood action movies are obsessed with the name Jack? Half the heroes who come out of this genre carry that quick, one-syllable name. Why can't movies be more creative in giving names to their heroes?Jack is the only name to fill the image of the main character in "Get Carter." What other name could stand behind a hulking, stylish character who speaks macho phrases like "My name is Jack Carter, and you don't want to know me." Sylvester Stallone gives the conventional character a sense of brooding strength and heart that only the conventional "Jack" could deem worthy. Michael Caine portrayed Jack Carter in the original film based on the Ted Lewis novel Jack's Return Home. Now Sylvester Stallone brings a fresh new edge to the character. Spending his life collecting for powerful clients, Jack Carter stands apart from the people in his life. When his brother dies, however, he sets out to investigate his siblings' death. This takes Carter back to his family roots in Seattle. He reconnects with his brother's wife, who isn't thrilled to see him. "Now you come back? Where were you when your brother needed you? You were never here at Christmas or vacations; you were never here at the birth of your niece. Just go home, Jack."Perhaps the biggest problem with "Get Carter" lies in the film's inability to connect with the audience. In the production notes, the filmmakers rant about redemption and morality, but it appears they were so concerned with the message of the movie that they assumed we would automatically get it. We don't.There's a real strong sense of a back story here, but the screenplay by David McKenna ("American History X") doesn't include the audience in this concept. The characters feel very connected, and the mounting tension becomes especially effective in the third act, but we know so little about the circumstances, it's hard to become involved in Jack Carter's interest of bringing the villains to justice.Those villains remain a mystery until the end. Perfectly timed and calculated, the film reveals the right amount of information at the right time. Considering the bland, blatantly straightforward dialogue, the unconventional cast delivers fine performances. Alan Cumming and Mickey Rourke slither across the screen as characters who instantly appear as if they can't be trusted. Michael Caine even lands a role here as the boss of Jack's deceased brother. Director Stephen T. Kay brings an edgy, innovative style to the film. The lighting, camera technique, costuming, and even the physical action scenes are somewhat unusual and unquestionably contemporary. The action scenes are shot with a great amount of detail and mood, but the editing often feels rushed and skittish. The artistic merit in the choreography slips away from the violent encounters that leave too much to the imagination.On the other side of the chart, some of the scenes last way too long. The endless, melodramatic conversations, laden with contrived pauses between sentences, feel like something out of a soap opera. The corny soundtrack adds greater camp to the humorous attempt at drama. Despite opening to disastrous reviews, "Get Carter" does offer some decent material. However, albeit this is a close miss, I cannot recommend the film because of the performances and artistic design alone. This movie has the potential for much more than silly dialogue, contrived situations, and an undeveloped back story. There's an easy way to tell if a remake works or not. After watching the movie, does it make you want to see the original version. I haven't seen the original "Get Carter," and after watching this version, that isn't at the top of my must do list. </fullReview>

Were this in fact simply a stand-alone film, rather than a re-hash of Michael Caine's finest moment, it might even have worked.The film is handsomely mounted, some excellent supporting roles, notably Mickey Rourke's, but despite so much they did right, the film is pretty much a crashing bore in the wash-up. Way more "talky" than even the original and without the bleak "hardness" of Britain's north.Very little altered from the original except for the LA setting but one can only question the logic of attempting to remake the un-remakeable! Caine cameos here and makes a worthwhile contribution, being on the end this time of Carter's famous line in the original. "You're a big man, but out of condition!"If however you have never seen the original, that is a major bonus and for you people this is worth a watch. Compared to DRIVEN, it is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Bad As I Expected ....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>.... But that`s probably because I was expecting the worst movie ever made . This remake of the classic Brit thriller is far from being the worst movie ever made but it is rather substandard . Director Stephen Kay seems to have been influenced by MTV and this shows up in his directing , a funeral scenes is accompanied by a Moby song , a punch up is accompanied by Rush Holme With Love by Mint Royale ( A track that seems to be to film soundtracks this decade what Voodoo Chile was to film soundtracks the last decade ) while the final sequence closes with a track from Grove Armada . I do confess I do like MTV but if you don`t you`ll hate this directing style .There`s two aspects to the script that I disliked . One is the dialogue that tries to be super cool with lines like " Hold on there slick , all of a sudden you`re the f***in` good guy " and " We`ll take it to another level " which sounds false and unconvincing . The other is changes made to the original 1971 movie . I won`t spoil it for you but nearly everything from bleak original has been changed to a completely inferior story . If you liked the way everything worked in the original you`ll dislike the way everything plays out here The cast are very uneven and strangely for a thriller it`s the female cast members that give the best performances especially Rachael Leigh Cook and Miranda Richardson . It goes without saying Sly fails as a violent anti hero while Alan Cumming is very annoying and camp . Mickey Rourke spends the entire movie posing , John McGinley seems to be on speed while Michael Caine makes little impression .This remake isn`t as bad as some people have made out though it`s not nearly as good as the original . I give it four out of ten</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie has just opened in here and though I've read a lot of bad reviews of it I had to go to see it because Michael Caine has a small part in it and I loved the original "Get Carter" from 1971.Unfortunately the movie is indeed a bad one. The script is a good material but with probably the worst performance by Stallone ever it is lost forever. The authors wanted to give some additional psychological aura to the character of Jack Carter but Stallone simply cannot render any emotions. His make-up and his beard are terrible and the suit he's wearing makes things look even worse. His mimic looks rather funny and makes you laugh out loud in the most dramatic moments. The direction tends to be very fresh and praises the conventions of a music video but it's not enough and makes the movie loose any mood. Fast editing, lots of flashes and different types of cinematography do not help. Too much technic and too much loud music, which by the way is pretty good.Mickey Rourke as Cyrus Paice definitely tops Stallone's wooden acting but he relates rather on exposing his muscles than playing and it's a pity. Alan Cumming is terrible, overacted and simply stupid as Kinnear.The only highlights are Michael Caine and Miranda Richardson. They both easily make their characters believable and realistic. It's a pity their parts are so small.</fullReview>
