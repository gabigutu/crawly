		<shortDescription>Elegant and intimate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Produced in 1948 prior to the Communist takeover in China, Spring in a Small Town is a lyrical depiction of the intense psychological rivalry between two friends for the love of one woman. Directed by Fei Mu and based on a short story by Li Tianji, the film dramatizes the emotional entanglement of four people, conveying an intense eroticism that is powerful and haunting. Dai Liyan (Shi Yu), and his wife Zhou Yuwen, magnificently portrayed by the alluring Wei Wei, live in his old family house with Liyan's teenage sister, Dai Xiu (Zhang Hongmei) and the family servant Lao Huang (Cui Chaoming). Because of Liyan's tuberculosis, they are forced to sleep in separate rooms. Yuwen is a loyal and devoted wife but is bored and prefers to spend her time embroidering or going for solitary walks along the top of the crumbling city wall. When Zhang Zhichen (Li Wei), a boyhood friend of Liyan who is now a doctor arrives from Shanghai, it is revealed that Yuwen was his childhood sweetheart when she was only sixteen. The tension becomes palpable as each character is forced to hide their true self and feelings are expressed only with glances, body language, mannerisms, and silence. Zhichen's arrival brings a spark of life to the moribund household and soon all are taking walks together, singing songs, and playing games. The relationship between Yuwen and Zhichen slowly becomes rekindled and is crystallized at Xiu's 16th birthday party when both have too much to drink. When Yuwen cuts her hand on broken glass after a struggle with Zhichen, however, a distressing event occurs that transforms everyone's life.Spring in a Small Town has an elegance and intimacy that I found lacking in the remake last year by Tian Zhuanghuang. By depicting events from Yuwen's point of view and adding a poetic voiceover, Mu's film brings us much closer to the characters. Spring in a Small Town did not receive immediate critical acclaim when it was released and Fei Mu was labeled a "rightist" and left for Hong Kong, never to make another film. The film only began to find its audience when the China Film Archive made a new print in the early 80s. Now many Chinese critics consider it the greatest Chinese film ever made. I certainly would not argue with that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite Excell., Re-make This Stands Alone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Spring in a Small Town" is a remarkable fusion of classic form and the convincingly real. It moves from its central character, Yuwen, who is isolated in a small town, and in an arranged marriage with an ill neurasthenic husband, Lyan; and moves too from a truly enduring acting job by Wei Wei as Yuwen. The story revolves around memory: memory of love, and memory of a pre-war period of youthful promise. These moments of being are stirred to life by the visit of the husband's long estranged friend Zhang, who is now a city doctor. Zhang means renewed life and vigor at the desolate, war ruined estate of the noble Lyan, and love and passion to Yuwen, who happens to have been someone she once loved as a teen. But Zhang's surprising appearance is more widening of vision than epiphanal. It's complicated by Yuwen's passionate desires and longings concentrated under the guise of romance, the doctor's scruples and detachment, her husband's illness, depression, and stoic passivity, and her sister-in-law's budding mutual relationship with Zhang. But there is no love triangle here, nor double love-triangle--something far more subtle is happening and it's happening in that whole arena suggestive of love and affection--one that extends into a range of human emotions, but is not romantic love itself. Although there is clearly a patriarchal social world at work here, its oppressions are not exactly active in or bearing down on the two male and two female characters of this intimate drama. Each character has a kind of self-direction which comes from some inner sense of integrity, and acceptance of the life dealt them. They have deep emotions, but these are more felt than viewed. In other words, no one character dominates any other, so that each is free to call upon aspects of themselves which can result in self-determined responses and/or personal changes that are small but lasting adjustments.The result is a world of stasis and intimacy which bears the physical-ness of the natural world. The characters seem to be as embodied as the stones of the ancient walls of the estate. They exist and move in a kind of equal world in which each senses the most minute emotion, movement, or thought in another--sometimes in soundless scenes. Honesty and simplicity arising from honoring the complexity of human-ness are what sets Fei Mu's film apart. "Spring" is one of the most beautiful of all films because the things of beauty, sensuality, love, the natural world are more akin to hints than expressions. A breeze, spring sunshine, plants, the moon, water, fire are almost unnoticeably present, as are glimmering lights in an interior stillness. And all this bears more weight because of the period between war and change which seems to create a profounder environment. One in which the destruction of towns and persons is experienced in say the town's depopulation or the mild husband's bitterness and self-defeat. Yes, buildings and lives are equally vulnerable in Fei Mu's somewhat inconsolable world.But "Spring" is as much about spring, as it is about the gravitas of war. Lyan's young sister Xiu has a youthful spontaneous presence which with all its trust, directness, driving sympathy pushes both her brother into re-connecting to memory, and her sister-in-law into and through the painful memory of Zhang's failure to be in love with her back then. In the end, Yuwen may not be less alone, but she is more in sync with her husband's now awakened life and affection and more in touch with her own emotional life which was deeper than what she understood it to be. Dr. Zhang and Liyan do not answer her passions, but they have both contributed to her more certain grasp of them. There is a touch of sadness at end though, because the male social structures are still in place and Yuwen needs a fuller life--it's perhaps promised in her sister-in-laws embrace of all that must await both women.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Xiao Chen Zhi Chun is a great movie, not only in the year it was shot but also now. It's an art movie which is not outdated even in 21st century. The director maintained a good narrative skill and thus made the story so smooth!The movie reminds me of the later French new wave movie: Francois Truffaut's "Femme d'a cote" which is of the similar topic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For the sake of Romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For Romance's sake, as a married man. The following two films are recommended.1. Brief Encounter by David Lean (1945), UKWell, when a woman goes to a railway station, something may happen. And it happened! How she longed to be there, in a little tavern waiting for the man of her dreams. But she was married... the man was a stranger to the fantasizing woman2. Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun by Fei Mu (1948), ChinaWell, when a woman goes to the market to buy fish, grocery and medicine, passing through the ruins of an ancient wall in a small town, there is much to think about, about the melancholy of her life, her sick husband in self-pity and lack of future...Just when a jubilant young doctor arrived, something happened... the doctor was a high school honey of the fantasizing womanIn both movies, from great directors of UK and China, the passion vs restraint was so intense, yet in the end the intimate feelings had not developed into any physical contacts. That leaves you with a great after-taste, sniffing it intensely without biting it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pressing restoration is needed for this early Chinese masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unanimously hailed as the finest Chinese film ever made by critics, as a first-time viewer, expectation couldn't been higher for Mu Fei's SPRING IN A SMALL TOWN, made one year before the establishment of People's Republic of China. This early talkie actually is a tiny-scaled drama with a five-actors cast, and the main sets are a ruined family compound and a damaged rampart, with a short passage of a foursome boat pastime.A dominant voice-over from Yuwen (Wei), a downcast housewife, runs through the entirety of the film, with clearly-pronounced accent, it not just details her behaviours and inner thoughts, but also comments on other characters' conducts as a meticulous guide for audience, for fear that we will overlook the precisely-enacted nuances which imbue the breath of life for its longevity. It is a repressed love-triangle, Yuwen marries Liyan (Shi) for eight years, he has been an invalid for the past six years, laments on his inability to revive his once-prosperous family after the Second Sino-Japanese War (ended in 1945), and harbours an intractable guilt towards Yuwen for not being a capable husband and wasting her youth in taking care of him.One day, an unexpected visitor Zhichen (Li) arrives, he is Liyan's childhood friend, now a doctor from Shanghai, whom Liyan haven't met for a decade. And an awkward revelation is that Zhichen is also Yuwen's old flame, who leaves her 10 years ago to join the army, which is unbeknown to Liyan. So, inevitably, life gives Yuwen a second chance since obviously she and Zhichen are still having fervent feelings towards each other, but what about Liyan, who now becomes the only barrier between them. Up to this stage, the central narrative has been superbly weaved into a gripping ethical conundrum. On paper, Liyan's poor health condition makes him an easy prey to be dispatched, but in reality, people have concerns about their integrity, both Yuwen and Zhichen are far from evil doers like those in THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE (1946) and Ossessione (1943), their passion is shackled by moral obligations. On the night of Zhichen's young sister Xiu's (Zhang) sixteenth birthday, boosted by booze and the festive mood, it grows to be a sleepless night for all three of them. Here Li Tianji's intelligible script sets up a brilliant plot device, the sleeping pills, Zhichen changes the pills, to pre-empt Wuwen's idea of suicide, but in the twist of fate, this action ultimately saves Liyan's life, restores the status quo, an anti-climatic master stroke, imagine if he hadn't changed it, he and Yuwen might still have a chance to be together although they have to abide by the guilt from then on.As an austere chamber drama, the acting betrays its time, methodical, a tad formulaic and melodramatic, but fortunately pertinent to the slow-burning pace of the narrative, dialogues are terse but there is the torrid undercurrent seething with the unspeakable emotions - desire, regret, loneliness, guilt, dissatisfaction and a glimpse of hope in the end. The three leads invoke a magnetic tug-of-war, typifies the national ethos of restraint and scepticism embedded deeply among Chinese people at that time.In retrospect, it is understandable that the film was overlooked during its release, its suppressed tenor was ill at ease with the national spirit of its time, when the poverty-and- warfare-afflicted mass was eagerly anticipating the birth of a new country, that's why there are so many hidden gems all around the world need rediscovery, alas the DVD version I watched is barely serviceable, the audio track is patchily impaired, a further restoration is indeed pressing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Xiao cheng zhi chun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The narration here becomes a character in itself. Initially it takes on the mundane, lifeless quality of Wei Wei's life and domesticity, retelling her daily events with a monotony about it. This is the internalisation of her emotions having been married for 6 years but separated for at least 2. And then as Li Wei arrives as a spark the narrator is silenced and she finds her voice again, no longer disappearing into her thoughts and "floating along in existence". Her mind becomes anew, her eyes see again. Early on we see her wandering aimlessly. With Li by her side, she could stand there all day without care in the world. We see little of the small town. The focus is the love quadrangle, but in particular the childhood sweethearts. Their dialogue is suggestive as they dance around each other; the subtext of their attraction shines through (how many other romances have used this sort of tension - the audacious Hollywood version of it can be found in Gilda). But they only circle, they do not touch. In the Mood for Love was the pinnacle of this theme and we can see its influence here. Intimacy becomes locked in and internalised because it would be a moral wrong. Fei Mu almost doesn't want us to see it, bathing them in a sensual darkness. But it is spring and nature beckons. That final shot is such a poetic reconciliation of all the character's woes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are looking for a slice of life movie, look no further. A word of caution, however: this movie is a story, and a child of its time. There is no spectacular camera work, no epic soundtrack (or sound at all, for the most part), and certainly no special effects. Even the acting and dialogues are passable, at best. If you need any of these things to be immersed or even enjoy a movie, Spring in a Small Town is not for you.There are four characters in the movie (and I mean four, there are no other supporting cast members or extras). The first two we are introduced are a couple, and they are "content". This is he best word to describe their situation, for they are not happy nor sad. You quickly realize that they have been frozen in time for years.The conflict is created when an old friend (of both) comes back to town. This establishes the classic love triangle: the old friend has feelings for the wife, and she is torn between her own feelings towards him (or what she believes them to be) and those towards her husband. There is little more to say about this movie without spoiling, except reiterate that this is a Chinese movie from the 40's. This is very much removed from the "factory assembled" plot lines that have plagued movies/books/video games/series for a long time.If you were keeping track, the fourth character is the couple's caretaker, and he is a supporting character. In the end, i still walk away with a lesson: no matter how much we think our life will stay the same, things will always happen. Whether they create change or not, is up to us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little seen masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For decades it was almost impossible to see Chinese films here in the West so directors like Mu Fei meant little to us but if "Spring in a Small Town" had been the only film he'd made his place in cinematic history would still be assured. This small, simple masterpiece is one of the greatest love stories ever filmed and yet the lovers hardly ever touch and never kiss and sex never rears its head and yet theirs is a passion of the most devastating kind.The plot is incredibly simple and there are only five characters. A young husband, ill with TB, lives with his unhappy wife, his younger sister and a male servant in a house damaged from eight years of war. One day an old childhood friend comes to visit and, as it turns out, he is, unbeknown to the husband, an old flame of the wife's. The visitor is embarrassed by the situation as he awakens feelings in the wife that she has long repressed.There's an almost Chekovian sense of loss and regret to the picture that might have seemed rare in a western film of the period. It's beautifully acted, particularly by Wei Wei as the wife, and gorgeously photographed in black and white by Shengwei Li. It was remade in 2002 by Zhuangzhuang Tian and for once the remake didn't disgrace the original and shouldn't be missed either but this is the real deal. World cinema doesn't get much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spring in a small town</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my mind, the film had a wonderful visual, such as stylish costumes, well footage countryside, realistic production designing done by Ning Che and Dexiong Zhu and Shengewe Li's decent monochrome cinematography. I did not like the camera fading into black because it looked dull to me. The moving image made the setting look natural: the damaged bricks,reflective lakes,smooth grass, you name it. Shengewe Li's Chiaroscuro was well skilled because it made me feel like I staring into a historical painting. To add, I enjoyed listening to the clever sound effects because it made me feel engaged with Mu Fei directed piece of art. There were only two or three songs but it sounded beautiful like stage opera. In addition, the storyline travelled through relationships and consequences after the Chinese civil war between Kaishek's Nationalists and Mao's Communist's. As an audience, it made me feel like I could moderately empathise with the characters who adapted from the horrific battle between those two parties. I will give the motion picture a 7/10 for its creative piece that is based on a short story by Li Tiana.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple but well done.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Spring in a Small Town" is a very simple movie--a simple premise, a small cast and it's all done in a very restrained manner. It's a definite example of minimalistic cinema and is worth your time.The film is set in rural China--just a year before the Communist takeover. Liyan is sickly--with tuberculosis. However, his main problem is depression--he feels very sorry for himself and has no will to do anything. Most of the time, he just sits outside and broods. Not surprisingly, his wife (Yuwen) is not happy but is quite dutiful towards her husband. Into this sad family comes a surprise visit from one of Liyan's old friends who he hasn't seen in a decade. But it gets more complicated. The friend (Zhang) is shocked to see that Liyan's wife is his old lover!! Not surprisingly, he and Yuwen say nothing and at first, they keep their distance. Where does all this go? It probably doesn't go exactly where you expect....see it and find out for yourself.My score of 8 is awfully high for such a simple film, but I was impressed that the movie was handled so simply and honestly. My only complaint, and you can't blame the filmmakers, is that the quality of the DVD print is pretty poor. My assumption is that Cinema Epoch did not have access to a better copy--though it would be nice to see this film restored to eliminate the scratches and clean everything up a bit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tian's remake is no good at all. I only click on his remake documentary to see Wei Wei, the original actress back in the classic 1948 film say a few words to the crew. We are going to meet Wei Wei this Sunday (28/3/2010) after the showing of Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun in the Hong Kong Film Archiev. Wei Wei is almost 90 years old in silver hair, her cameo appearance in Hong Kong films is always a surprise to her fans. In this year's Hong Kong Film Festival, a special program is dedicated to Fei Mu, director of this epic movie and Wei Wei's still shot from the movie is being seen all around in Hong Kong. My son, who turns 21 this year, is surprised Wei Wei was so beautiful then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film about deep and unspoken human relationships.Eventually they do become spoken, but is there a chance to change anything about the situation.Originally made in Shanghai 1948 and quite free of propaganda the film introduces us to the Dai Family. There is still some weight about the history that surrounds the family. History usually has weight in Chinese literature and serious film.A young married couple - Liyan, an invalid, and his wife Yuwen live in a once great family compound that is partially ruined.A bright contrast is Liyan's young sister who cannot really remember the past of the family but accepts everything in quite a natural way. Her spirit is as bright as the other two are reserved.Into this apparently stable world comes an unexpected visitor...I ended up feeling quite sad - but definitely a superior film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spring in a Small Town</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this Chinese film listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, the title did not suggest anything particular in terms of storyline or plot, but I was willing to watch it whatever. Basically following the end of World War II, the Dai family were once prosperous, but have become ruined in the compound, husband and patriarch Liyan (Shi Yu) has become an invalid and spends his days experiencing nostalgia of the past in the courtyard. Liyan's marriage Zhou Yuwen (Wei Wei) has become loveless for a long time, but both feel concern for each other, Liyan's young teenage sister Xiu (Zhang Hongmei) is too young to remember the past, she stays cheerful and playful in the ruins of the house, there is also the family's old faithful servant Lao Huang (Chaoming Cui). An unexpected visitor into this dreary but unchanging existence or the family, Liyan's childhood friend Zhang Zhichen (Li Wei) is a doctor from Shanghai, also a former flame of Yuwen before she met her husband. The rest if the film sees Yuwen, Liyan, Zhichen and Xiu caught in a love quadrangle. Yuwen is conflicted feels love for Zhichen, but has loyalty for Liyan and her family. Liyan loves his wife, but feels unworthy of her and ashamed of himself. Xiu has turned sixteen, she develops feelings for Zhichen, who himself is conflicted himself between his love for Yuwen and loyalty to his friend. It is apparent to Liyan and Xiu that Yuwen and Zhichen still love each other, Liyan attempts suicide, but Zhichen resuscitates him, Zhichen leaves, with Huand and Xiu walking him to the train station, he promises to return in a year, Yuwen watch Zhichen watches from the wall, with Liyan by her side. Also starring Hongmei Zhang as Meimei. I only just got what was going on during the film, because you have to read many subtitles, I admit I may drifted off somewhere, but I got the gist of the story, with a love triangle (or square) between the four main characters, it was rather quiet throughout, but you certainly felt the melancholic stuff, and there was good camera-work and lighting, all in all it's not a bad drama. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a nice little movie with a nice story, that plays the most important role in the entire movie.It's a quite intriguing dramatic story, with also romance present in it. The story is being told slowly but this works out all too well for its build up. The characters are nice and portrayed nicely by its actors. Normally I'm not a too big fan of the Asian acting style but the acting in this movie was simply good.Of course the movie is quite different in its approach and style from other genre movies, produced in the west. In a way this movie is more advanced already with its approach than the western movies made during the same era.I only wished the movie its visual style would had been a bit better. For a movie that is considered a kind of an art-house movie this movie is certainly lacking in some well looking sequences. This was obviously a quite cheap movie to make and it got made quite generically. Not that this is a bad thing, it just prevent this movie from truly distinct itself and raising itself above the genre.But oh well, this movie is all about its well constructed story and characters that are in it. In that regard this movie most certainly does not disappoint.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheesy melodrama that is supposedly China's best ever film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frequently voted China's greatest film ever by Chinese critics, as well as Chinese film enthusiasts from the outside, and, frankly, I don't get it at all. What I saw was one of the most generic melodramas imaginable, blandly directed and acted, with a complete shrew for a protagonist. Wei Wei (don't laugh) is that shrew, a young married woman who has suffered alongside her tubercular husband (Yu Shi) for the past several years. It is post WWII, and they live with the husband's teenage sister (Hongmei Zhang) in a dilapidated home with not much money (the man had been wealthy when they married). Along comes the husband's old best friend (Wei Li), who also used to be the wife's boyfriend when they were teens. She considers running away from her husband with this man, while the husband pretty much remains oblivious, thinking he may engage his little sister to his friend. That's the set-up, and it doesn't go anywhere you wouldn't expect it to. I've actually seen the remake, directed by Blue Kite director Zhuangzhuang Tian. It runs a half hour longer, and is actually kind of dull, too, but at least it was pretty. This supposed classic is pretty intolerable.</fullReview>
