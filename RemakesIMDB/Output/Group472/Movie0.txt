		<shortDescription>Corman meets Shakespeare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came across this movie by chance one night late on the tv. I checked the review in the tv guide and thought it would be an adaptation of one of my favourite plays by Shakespeare: Richard III. However, when I noticed that Roger Corman directed and the guide labelled this movie a horror movie I had mixed feelings. Corman turned the story of Richard Gloucester who "gets rid" of those who stand between him and the throne of England. Corman does that in accordance with the way the people are put away with in the Shakespearean play, but (of course) with greater detail. Plus, Corman focuses more on theoccult aspects - Richard haunted by the spirits of those he killed. However, during the whole movie it does not quite become clear whether those ghosts are real or just hallucinations of Richard's poor soul. Vincent Price - once again - gives a superb villain, very reminiscent of Boris Karloff (who I think played Richard, as well). A perfect movie for dark, chilly nights, with fog and storm outside, and a blanket to crouch underneath.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vincent Price is the KING...of agony!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In between basing no less than seven movies on the wondrously macabre writings of author Edgar Allan Poe, the mega-versatile cinema wizard Roger Corman also found the the time to adapt a famous William Shakespeare play and turn it into an effectively creepy and atmospheric 60's chiller. The greatest actor who ever walked the earth ? Vincent Price, who else? ? plays another malicious but emotionally tormented protagonist in the English kingdom of the late 15th century. He is Richard Plantagenet, unlikely to ever inherit the throne in a righteous way, but willing to kill blood relatives in order to become King of all England. But immediately after murdering his own brother and other innocent people that stand in his way, the restless spirits of his victims come back to haunt him in visions. "Tower of London" is a fascinating history lesson, perhaps not very accurate, but at least vastly entertaining and providing more than enough genuine frights and atmosphere. Continuously descending further into madness, sir Richard submits his victims to uncanny medieval torture devices, like a stretching-rack and a rat cage that gets placed on a poor guy's head. The photography is in stylish black &amp; white, the costumes are downright enchanting and the use of medieval vocabulary sounded like pure music to my ears. Vincent Price is amazing, as always, portraying the historical madman that also suffered from a hereditary handicap. The performances of the supportive cast are sadly a bit hammy. For some reason and unlike most other masterpieces starring Price, this baby is rather difficult to find but definitely worth searching for. A must for fans of classic horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting, but weak remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger Corman is (in his way) a genius regarding making effective films on a relatively small budget. In the late 1950s and through the 1960s he basically followed Edward Wood's "pioneering" in the use of name stars in his films. Unlike Wood, however, Corman knows how to direct and produce. You look at his movies, and instead of finding screamingly funny (unintended) blunders you keep watching the actors and listening to the lines. He latched onto Edgar Allan Poe far more than had happened in Hollywood in the past, and while he stretched Poe's stories (and in the case of THE RAVEN his poetry) out of recognizable limit to what the originals are, enough of the original framework remains to leave the movie respectable and sometimes far more than that (such as my favorite Corman - Poe flick, "The Masque Of The Red Death").Corman turned from Poe to William Shakespeare in this 1962 film, "Tower of London", which (while based on the Sir Thomas More - William Shakespeare version of the character, career, and reign of King Richard III of England) is a remake of the 1939 Basil Rathbone film "Tower of London". That film was quite effective, given the talents of Rowland Lee (it's director), Rathbone, Boris Karloff (as the cruel executioner Mord), and the cast including Ian Hunter, John Rodion, and Vincent Price (as the "Duke of Clarence"). It's defects are of the same historical variety found in most historical films (i.e. accuracy), and in the continuing issue of whether Richard (who, after all, was finally defeated and killed by Henry VII at Bosworth Field) has been traduced. Also it (and this remake) have both been pushed into the background of the cinema loving public by Sir Laurence Olivier's performance as the evil usurper in his version of Shakespeare's "Richard III".The 1939 version really benefited by a larger budget (although a "B" feature) and a studio's sets and stages. Corman manages to get real mileage out of his ability to improvise intelligently (as opposed to Wood). A classic example of getting more with less. He used footage from the earlier film for the battle sequence, but he added atmospheric touches showing fog and a swamp that were quite good.One thing he uses from Shakespeare is that he used the ghosts of the various victims of Richard to haunt him. This includes not only Clarence, but King Edward, the two Princes in the Tower, and Buckingham (who was a Duke - that title has been one of the most fatal in British history!).* Actually Shakespeare had them all pop up before Richard's battle at Bosworth, as the King tries to sleep - they all recount what he did to them, and tell him to despair and die. In Corman's hands, after each evil crime, Richard is confronted by the ghosts who demand his explanation, and he gives mealy ("realpolitik") excuses ("You were not strong enough to be a good King!"). It's an interesting approach, but it really does not sound viable.(*Think of this - First you have this Duke of Buckingham, a cousin of the House of York, who tries to be a leading supporter of Richard, but finds himself pushed aside - Richard probably didn't trust him. Buckingham led a revolt in 1485 against Richard, lost the revolt, and Richard ordered him executed. Then you had the title revived and given to a cousin and male heir to Henry VIII, who would get involved in several questionable actions in 1521 - including possible witchcraft to encompass Henry's demise. He went to the executioner's block as a result. Nobody wanted the title for a century. Then it was revived first as Earl then as Duke for Georger Villiers, favorite of both James I and Charles I, and he becomes the de facto Prime Minister of England. But his poorly planned policies raise the public against him, and he is assassinated in 1628 - the subject of Dumas' "The Three Musketeers". The title was revived in the 19th Century as the Duke of Buckingham and Chandos. Nothing happened finally.) Price does what he can as Richard, but he lacks the vicious inner strengths (oddly enough) of both Rathbone and Olivier. They know what they want and know how to get it (and think they know how to keep it). Price has a type of uncertainty that suggests his actions were successful in spite of himself, not because of his sagacity. His surprise when he suddenly learns he is facing Henry at Bosworth (a name he supposedly never heard of - yet he hears a warning concerning Bosworth earlier from a ghost that should have set him looking for any place that had that name to avoid it!) is really surprising. He only has one powerful moment - when he decides to execute Buckingham. The viciousness of the torture used brings out Price's special horror gifts to the fore. But that is an isolated sequence.The film is strong enough on it's own to merit watching, but I would wait for the original "Tower of London" or the Olivier (or later McKellan) "Richard III".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The madness of King Richard!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The team of Roger Corman and Vincent Price is undoubtedly most famous for the adaptations of Edgar Allen Poe's works, but it would be unwise to ignore this interpretation of William Shakespeare's play 'Richard III' as it's one of the duo's finest hours! This same story was brought to the screen 23 years earlier with the 1939 film of the same name (also featuring Vincent Price), but Corman's version, although obviously made on a limited budget is still a great version of the tale. The plot features prominent themes of envy, greed and insanity, and the story of one of England's most famous rulers is interesting for its own merits, and Corman's portrayal of it makes it interesting for fans of classic horror also. The plot begins with the death of the current king of England, Richard's brother. The throne is intended to go to the brother's son, but King Richard has other ideas as he begins to murder all those that stand in his path to the most coveted seat in the country. However, what he doesn't count on is his conscience getting in the way; and before long, he is being haunted by the ghosts of his victims.Every film in the Corman's Poe Anthology is filmed in colour, but here Corman shoots on black and white film, and it does the story no end of favours as the atmosphere always feel thick and foreboding, and gorgeous shots of smoke filled locations help to increase the tension. The fact that the film stars the great Vincent Price is most definitely its strongest element. Price is best at playing villains and people suffering from mental torment, and here he gets to do both in the meaty role of King Richard III. Price's acting style certainly suits Shakespearian roles as he's never afraid to go over the top, and I'm sure Corman was always happy to capitalise on this fact as Price is allowed to let rip completely during many instances of the film. Price also manages to look sinister while he's being hammy, and just small things such as the little hat that Price wears give him an understated villainy that suits the role like a glove. The supernatural elements of the film are well utilised, and Corman is happy to capitalise on the horror aspects of the play at all times. The ending is a little abrupt, but overall, this film is a definite 'hit' and one that shouldn't be missed by Price, Corman and even Shakespeare fans!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great if you remind yourself this is NOT good history and you don't mind the hamminess of Price's performance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King Richard III of England is a very tough guy to understand today because the truth about him is hopelessly muddled. Most of what we THINK is true about him comes from Shakespeare's Richard III--which is very entertaining but Skakespeare was probably no better a historian than Paris Hilton! His histories are based on both traditional tales AND an effort to make the Tudor dynasty look good (after all, Elizabeth was queen while many of his plays were produced and if they were critical of her family, he would have likely been beheaded). So, considering that Richard III was murdered by her grandfather (Henry VII), it's not surprising that in the play he's a scheming and deformed jerk. This film also is based somewhat on Shakespeare's tradition, though he's far crazier. Whether Richard actually killed his nephews, walked like a hunchback or was so untrustworthy and stupid is up for debate--and many historians do question the traditional view of the king.Now, if you aren't a history teacher or a member of the Richard III Society (www.richardiii.net), most of this probably won't matter very much to you. My advice is to just watch the film for it's entertainment value--not historical.As entertainment, it's not bad. Fans of Vincent Price will especially enjoy his way over the top and highly emotional re telling of the reign of Richard. Seeing his face contort and ghosts popping in and out certainly is fun to watch, as is the nasty scene involving dropping a rat in a cage on a man's face! Obviously, this is NOT a Merchant-Ivory production!! No, in many ways it's highly reminiscent of director Roger Corman's other forays with Price (such as his Poe "inspired" films). And so, if you like them, you'll love this homage to insanity and evil. If you are looking for something more...well, you won't find it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shakespeare by way of Corman and Poe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>23 years before when Universal Pictures made Tower Of London, Vincent Price was featured as the luckless Duke Of Clarence who was as legend has it drowned in a vat of Malmsey wine. In 1962 Price took center stage in this Roger Corman adaption of the Richard III story. No flowery Shakespearean dialog here, this is a prose adaption heavily influenced by Edgar Allan Poe.Price plays Richard III as Shakespeare has sent him to us through history as an evil monster and child killer. The film follows along the lines of the adaption done by Universal in 1939 with Basil Rathbone as Richard.Unlike the Rathbone version, the character of Richard's wife Anne Neville. Left out was Richard's own child and when they both died and he had no direct successor his fate was sealed. Anne Neville is played by Joan Camden and while he never murdered her, she too haunts him after she's gone.Richard leaves quite a bloody trail on his way to power, but he's haunted by his victims, images of the beating tell tale heart like apparitions. They haunt him, but they sure don't deter him.Price does a good job with Richard and his performance certainly rates behind Laurence Olivier in the Shakespearean adaption and also that of Rathbone. I'm surprised he never opted for the Shakespeare play as a project.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The crowned King is a murderer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Legendary Roger Corman directs this remake of the 1939 classic of the same title. This period piece is made into a horror/melodrama that chills your spine. Atmospheric B&amp;W. Bloody events and plot twists thread through this low-budget feature. Vincent Price plays the hunchbacked Richard III, who ruthlessly tortures and murders anyone he deems standing in his way ascending to the throne of England. Richard is haunted by those he disposed of. This Gothic setting bodes well for Corman's sadistic style. Price's menacing and maniacal performance adds to his legend. One of Price's earliest roles was a supporting one in the afore mentioned 1939 original. Other players of note: Michael Pate, Joan Freeman, Donald Losby, Joan Camden, Robert Brown and Sandra Knight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Weak Outing for Corman and Price....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not anywhere nearly as well done as the 1939 version, this Corman/Price vehicle has to be the weakest of their collaborations.Price is generally too hammy here, not well-directed as in other Corman films, and definitely nowhere near his excellent performance in Witchfinder General. Sets are pretty much bare-bones, effects and battle scenes look like stock footage superimposed over characters acting out in front of a black curtain.The murder of the two young heirs to the throne of England is the best scene and very effective, however. The end of this film of a mere 79 mins. is very welcome to the viewer as about 70 mins. of it are practically a complete bore. Pretty much one to forget unless you have to collect every Corman/Price film ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth looking out for, but not one of Corman's best efforts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking forward to Tower of London as I am a big fan of Vincent Price and a lot of his and Corman's collaborations. After seeing it, I don't think it is one of their best, and the 1939 film while not perfect is a better film, but it is a decent film and should be better known than it is. Granted it is nowhere near perfect, the ending is abrupt, some of the supernatural scenes are more silly than they are haunting and most of the supporting cast are very hammy. The history is also questionable, though I wasn't expecting a history lesson when watching Tower of London and I don't count it as as big a flaw as the ones above. However, the sets, costumes and photography are quite good, the score has a haunting quality to it and the dialogue is intelligent. The story has some uneven moments, but the murders are very disturbing and there is a good atmosphere about it. The killings of the princes and Richard's decision to kill Buckingham are the best scenes of the film. Corman's direction is generally solid and Robert Brown and Joan Freeman are good in their roles and handle them with professionalism. But Vincent Price is the best actor in the film, his Richard of Gloucester is superb, the only one of the cast to make me feel that way. While slightly on the camp side, and I do think he has given better performances before and since, he is also menacing and troubled. All in all, not one of Corman's best but worth the viewing for Price's performances and the murder scenes. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Corman Does Shakespeare?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably the closest Roger Corman ever came to directing Shakespeare. It's a remake of a 1939 film that tells the story of Richard III, minus all the Shakespearean language. Corman added elements of Macbeth (and Hamlet?) to make it perhaps even a bit classier, but also so he could show lots of ghosts. Vincent Price, who played a drunken Clarence in the original, gets promoted to Richard for this version, and also gets a nasty hump on his back (the most pronounced of any version I've seen). It's good, solid costume drama, with extensive and creative use of torture chambers. Honestly, I somewhat prefer Richard as an unabashed villain, as portrayed by Ian McKellen, not as a tortured and haunted man, desperately trying to justify himself and flee his tormentors, but Price holds up well, and the photography and sets are memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vincent Price Reigns Supreme!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger Corman's "Tower of London" of 1962 is a great piece of Historical Horror and a fantastic depiction of madness, that has enriched the world of cinema with yet another magnificent performance by the incomparable Vincent Price. Vincent Price was in two films named "Tower of London" that dealt with the reign and villainy of Richard III, the other being Rowland V. Lee's great Historical Drama of 1939 in which, as a young actor, he played the supporting role of the Duke of Clarence alongside fellow icons Basil Rathbone and Boris Karloff. Personally, I first saw this 1962 film by Corman several years before first watching the 1939 film. Though both films are great, I must say that I still prefer this one. Unlike the 1939 film, this film is an actual Horror film, which focuses strongly on the King's madness and Horror elements. The reasons why I prefer this film (which is officially a remake, but very different to the 1939 version), are the Horror elements and the unspeakably intense and creepy atmosphere, but mainly the incredible on-screen persona of Vincent Price, whom I would call my favorite actor of all-time. Basil Rathbone was great in the role of the villainous king, but Price is sublime. The character is way more insane in this film. The cold-blooded, calculating villain King Richard of the 1939 film has become an equally villainous and murderous, but incalculable madman, haunted by the victims of his bloody path to kingship.Director Corman and star Price are always a great combination, as proved by their other collaborations, the brilliant Edgar Allan Poe adaptations which mark the peak of both men's careers. Films such as "Pit and the Pendulum" (1961, also starring the wonderful Barbara Steele, my favorite actress of all-time), "The Haunted Palace" (1963, which is actually the adaptation of an H.P. Lovecraft Story) of "The Masque of the Red Death" (1964) range among the greatest Horror films ever made. This is yet another magnificent collaboration of Price and Corman. Price gives a magnificent portrayal of madness and villainy in what is one of his most diabolical roles. The only film in which he plays an even more despicable character is Michael Reeves' 1968 masterpiece "Witchfinder General", and I would rate the role of Prince Prospero in Corman's own "Masque of the Red Death" on quite the same level of evilness as his role here. "Tower of London" has many macabre moments including several downright nasty torture scenes. As in all his Vincent Price films, Corman creates a genuinely creepy atmosphere, this being the only black-and-white film the two did together. Michael Pate plays the role of Richard's loyal and unscrupulous helper on his way to power, basically the role that the great Boris Karloff (another favorite actor of mine) played in the 1939 film. While Karloff played a cruel, but relatively simple-minded executioner loyal to his master Richard, the character 'Sir Ratcliffe' played by Pate is a devilishly cunning snake who isn't far behind Richard in devilish ingenuity. The settings are magnificent, and very similar to those in the 1939 film (though the photography is gloomier) it sometimes looks as if the same settings were used. Parts of the battle sequences from the 1939 film were edited into this one. Overall, this is an amazing film with another brilliant leading performance from the immortal Vincent Price. A must-see for all Horror fans!</fullReview>

Price is extremely evil in this movie making him an unlikable villain. But Price does die, and does he ever, but not before he goes on a killing spree.This version is actually superior to the 1939 version (that Price was also in), despite it's stature as a B-movie. Roger Corman directs and scores yet again along with his other stuff from the early sixties.I bought the Midnite Movies release of this and The Haunted Palace, and this turned out even better than HP.

		<fullReview>Sure, one shouldn't watch this looking to learn history lessons. Sure, it's not one of director Roger Cormans' better films. And yes, it's clear that Corman and his producer / brother Gene were working with a limited budget. But you just can't go wrong with Vincent Price at his theatrical, Shakespearean best. The film is thick with atmosphere, and the madness in the air of this thing provides the story with a lot of potency. This thing is FUN, damn it, and it merits a look.This is a remake of the 1939 film that also told the tale of the evil and conniving Richard of Gloucester. Price, who played the Duke of Clarence in "Tower of London" '39, here stars as Richard, a monster who contrives his way to the position of King of England. However, his misdeeds will not go unnoticed - various subjects plot to put a monkey wrench in his plans - or unpunished. Those people that Richard tortures or murders reappear as spirits that taunt him mercilessly.Price is ably supported by a fine bunch of actors: Michael Pate as his loyal henchman, lovely Joan Freeman as Lady Margaret, Robert Brown as the strapping Sir Justin, Bruce Gordon as the Earl of Buckingham, Joan Camden as Richards' Lady Macbeth-like wife, Richard Hale as Tyrus the physician, sexy Sandra Knight as Mistress Shore, and Charles Macaulay as Clarence. But make no mistake: this is his show. He dominates "Tower of London" with true ferocity. Richard is a compelling variety of antagonist.The ending falls short of being very satisfying, but up until then this historical drama / horror film shows its viewers a rollicking good time.Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

Vincent Price plays the deformed Richard III who will stop at nothing including torture and murder to ascend to the throne. But each evil act comes back to haunt him in this lively horror thriller. It's nowhere's near the as fine as The Pit and the Pendulum or The House of Usher but Price steals the show with his mincing, menacing, flamboyant Richard III. He's so much fun to watch you'll gladly overlook the shortcomings in the script and production design.

		<fullReview>Richard wants to be king, but when his brother dies that cannot happen without the death of his nephews. Well, you know, if all that stands between you and the throne of England is two murders, that's a small hurdle to cross for a sadistic madman.This is a remake of the 1939 film of the same name, though the horror factor is upped here thanks to director Roger Corman. Ivan Butler calls it "libelliously unhistorical", but assuming we all know this is not a documentary, it is pretty sweet. Vincent Price as a hunchback with a murderous hand? Oh, good stuff!While certainly not Corman and Price's best work together (see, of course, the Poe films), it's a little-watched piece that deserves more credit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tower of London</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger Corman directs his vision of the William Shakespeare story about the humpbacked evil conniving brother Richard III to dying King of England Edward IV with a unique spin. Vincent Price(quite animated) plays the mad Richard to the hilt with theatricality(I could also use the description, hammy, but he's still a joy to watch)as he murders those who stand in his way to the throne. Whether it's to whip and stretch the limbs of Mistress Shore(Sandra Knight), merely a handmaiden to the young princes of the throne, the suffocation of dead Edward's young sons, the accidental choking of his wife believing she was the ghost of Shore, placing a hungry rat in a head cage holding the Earl of Buckingham(Bruce Gordon), or stabbing his brother in the back..we see in Corman's surprisingly violent way(..hardly holding back..we see Richard, and his right-hand man, smother the children in the Tower as one drops a puppet). But, the difference Corman brings to the story is the ghosts who haunt Richard's guilty conscience. Most of the story's layout remains. He will gain his crown, but run into a battle unprepared against an enemy whose smarter and more levelheaded since it's clear Richard should've never been King to start with. He gains the crown, but doesn't have the brains or know-how to fight a battle against a superior enemy.I loved the angle Corman adds to the story regarding the ghosts haunting Richard as it adds a flavor to the picture..a ghoulish, entertaining element played with such macabre relish by a director with grand style in spite of limited budget and means. And, Corman's camera-work is stunning.However, I do feel purists will be turned off by this version of Corman's towards the story by Shakespeare..the dialogue is dumbed down to where it can be easily digestible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every day with King Richard is hump day!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Could you imagine spoofing the life of British King Richard III as a musical? Song titles such as my overview, "Disconnected With Winter" and of course, "I have a hunch I'm going to be King" could do for Shakespeare's tragedy the same way that the current Broadway smash "Something Rotten" is doing for "Hamlet".Not a remake of the Universal classic where Vincent Price played the Duke of Clarence, this has its own structure in telling the story of the mad king whose remains are rumored to have been recently found. King Richard has gotten his share of dramatization, and a recent revival of Shakespeare's play got him further interest. But this is American International's version of his life, one that is practically a one man show for Vincent Price, excellent if hammy, and a vision of one man's madness that controls his inner torment and feelings of guilt, manipulated by an insane ambition under the guise of doing what he felt was best for England.As the Duke of Clarence, Price was a victim of Richard's madness, another excellent performance by Basil Rathbone who along with Boris Karloff was responsible for his gruesome demise. The tortures and demises here are far more gruesome, involving a stretching rack, a rat in a wooden box covering somebody's head, and the attempted strangulation of a ghost which has a gruesome discovery of the victim for the devastated Price. Not as poetically written as Shakespeare's play, this adds more of the horror element, and it makes the story accessible to all audiences. As done in black and white, it comes off moodier and much more haunting. The usage of all of the victims as ghosts adds to the spookiness, and this makes it truly gripping rather than gory thanks to the insinuations of the horror rather than the use of excessive blood. Price has one of his great roles here, using melodramatic mannerisms to show Richard's inner torment. Shakespeare buffs may quibble a bit, but I don't think that they will be un-entertained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like all films labeled "History" this does not mean the story is entirely true - there will be people who once lived and places in history that are real but it does not mean what you see on film is historically accurate. Hollywood will take the facts then ad-lib or fill in the blanks. Keeping this in mind I will rate this film like I do other "History" films - I will NOT base my rating on historical accuracy nor inaccuracy but purely Hollywood CINEMA entertainment! I like Vincent Price so I am admittedly biased - but I think his portrayal of King Richard III was good. In real life we really do not know all that much about Richard's personality - only from stories written by others who might have exaggerated, simply lied about him because they did not like him OR maybe they were fairly accurate stories. I think Price did the best he could with the information he knew about the real King Richard III - and not just Price but the writers and the rest of the cast/crew did their best as well to give us this movie. I found this movie to be a good dramatization.This film is NOT a remake of the 1939 film of the same name ("Tower of London"). The 1939 film stars Boris Karloff, Basil Rathbone &amp; Vincent Price. The 1962 film only borrows the title from the 1939 film. The two stories are completely different from each other. One final note: I think it's cool they found the REAL King Richard III's body - buried under a parking lot where he fell in battle many many years ago. Love him or hate him - it's nice his remains are found: for the sake of history and the "royal" family.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen the original 1939 and this Corman remake i have to say i liked the original better,but this one is more graphic and somewhat creepy.Richard the 3rd played by wickedly by the late great Vincent Price of the horror rat pack(Karloff,Lugosi,Lee,Carridine,Cushing)there's ghosts,torture,and murder as Richard the 3rd makes his way to the throne with the help of his henchman(Micheal Pate)many other Roger Corman regulars are on hand,its kind of funny that this was'nt made by American international pictures but united artists a bigger studio with more money to invest,too bad they did'nt invest in a color print.but it is none the less horrific and Mr Price is great in the role.heres some trivia Vincent Price was in the original 1939 as the duke of Clarence,Richards brother who um dies in a vat of wine.this film is shown on the this television network a lot,it was on the website called fancast but was taken off.it is a very well made film,one of Roger Cormans best from the 60's.and one of Vincent Price's as well 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tower of London (1962) * 1/2 (out of 4) Vincent Price plays Richard III who murders his way to the throne but soon the ghosts of all he killed comes back to haunt him. I must admit that I didn't care too much for the 1939 version, which featured Karloff and Price but this one here is even worse. I think this is the worst film Corman and Price did together, which is a shame because there's a good movie here somewhere. There are a few nice scenes but overall I found everything to be quite bland and boring. Price is usually great in whatever he does but I found him to be rather bland here. The supporting performances weren't much better and in the end I can't help but feel this is a major misfire all around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Corman plays Shakespeare. Shakespeare loses.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger Corman took a break between such cinematic masterpieces as LITTLE SHOP and THE RAVEN to invade Shakespearean territory in TOWER OF London. I usually enjoy the Price/Corman schlock films, but this one was SO badly misconceived that I found myself fast-forwarding through scene after scene. Did Shakespeare have murders? Corman has more!! Did Shakespeare have ghosts? Corman has a dozen!! (Many poorly double-exposed and some not sized correctly for the scenes.) And of course, we have to have a Poe-inspired torture chamber with a damsel on the rack. Are you getting the picture? Then there's Vincent Price, looking silly in a Prince Valiant wig, mugging away through scene after scene showing his full range of horror-film facial expressions. His trademark mincing-lisping delivery, which works well in many contexts, doesn't lend King Richard much gravitas. There's no tragedy here, just grand guignol.So if you want to see a classic historical tale reduced to the lowest common denominator, be sure to catch Corman's TOWER.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Price is Low</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vincent Price fails to illuminate Richard III - possibly this is due to the direction of Roger Corman, and the resources available to the filmmakers. It's interesting to watch Mr. Price and the others attempt this odd version of Shakespeare; if you're not a fan of either, you probably won't enjoy this "Tower of London". Mr. Price as Richard kills many in his quest for the throne. Some of the deaths are (suggestively) quite disturbing, but the victims' "ghosts" are incredibly silly-looking. They act silly, too. The hero and heroine are played by Robert Brown and Joan Freeman. Their characterizations are okay; they seemed to know what their roles are and what kind of movie they are performing in, unlike some others in the cast. *** Tower of London (10/24/62) Roger Corman ~ Vincent Price, Robert Brown, Joan Freeman</fullReview>
