		<shortDescription>Vivid Acting Brings Royal Drama To Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the confines of the gloomy TOWER OF London, Richard, the treacherous Duke of Gloucester, murders his way to the throne of England.This lively &amp; enjoyable pseudo-historical drama presents some surprisingly good performances which do much to elevate the film and make it quite enjoyable.Basil Rathbone is excellent as Richard, leering &amp; smirking, dangerous as a poisonous serpent, he takes what could be a rather hammy part and gives it a certain malevolent stature. Here was a villain able to charm, coddle or kill his own brothers with equal skill. Rathbone makes him quite believable. (Oddly, while carrying Richard's humpback, Rathbone ignores the King's withered left arm.)Although this is not a horror film, Boris Karloff's Mord the Executioner is a very horrific character. Bald headed &amp; club-footed, he stalks about the Tower carrying out Richard's foul orders. Karloff makes an indelible mark in his very first scene, inflicting more torments on the denizens of the torture chamber. With such a striking performance, as well as his status as one of Universal's most celebrated actors, it is strange that Karloff doesn't receive equal billing with Rathbone here.Vincent Price does very well in the role of the nervous, jealous, doomed Duke of Clarence, holding up nicely to the over-the-top performances of Rathbone &amp; Karloff. (It is fascinating to see this early teaming of the three frightmeisters; the next time they would all appear in the same film would be in 1963's THE COMEDY OF TERRORS.)Special mention should be made of Ian Hunter as Edward IV. While acquiescing to all of Rathbone's bloody schemes, Hunter nonetheless injects an element of sardonic humor into the role, making it very entertaining.Barbara O'Neil as stately Queen Elizabeth, Nan Grey as spunky Lady Alice &amp; Rose Hobart as lovely Anne Neville each do good work in roles which demand little from any of the actresses.The supporting cast is sprinkled with familiar faces - Leo G. Carroll, Miles Mander, Lionel Belmore, Ernest Cossart - each excellent in small roles. Far down the cast list is Ralph Forbes as Henry Tudor. This splendid actor was on the very cusp of becoming a major star at the end of the silent era; although gifted with a fine speaking voice, he was never able to achieve his full potential in talking films.Movie mavens will recognize uncredited appearances by both Robert Greig as a friendly priest &amp; Nigel de Brulier as the archbishop who marries little Edward V.Universal gives the film a fine gloss, with good atmospherics. The exterior London scenes look impressive on the screen.The film presupposes a certain amount of intelligent knowledge to already be in the hands of the audience. Indeed, a working acquaintance with the facts surrounding the Wars of the Roses &amp; the English Line of Succession could only be of help to the viewer in unraveling the intricate plot.TOWER OF London should be enjoyed as entertainment, not accepted as historical fact. Modern research is slowly overturning many of the old beliefs concerning Richard of Gloucester. As a result, he is emerging as a far less bloody individual and one who may have been pilloried for centuries by an unfriendly press. Shakespeare, it should be remembered, was writing for the Tudors - who may have had their own dark ancestral deeds to hide. Indeed, there is much creditable speculation that it was actually Henry Tudor who had the young Tower Princes murdered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard III of England the maligned Plantagenent twisted by Shakespeare into the legendary ruthless embodiment of Machiavelli's Prince during the reign of the successful Tudor usurpers his only semi favorable appearance in literature is in R.L.Stevenson The Black Arrow. History wrote of him as a hunchbacked withered arm killer king. And in this movie,minus the shriveled left arm,he is. First seen on the local double dip of horror TV.show,it's really a historical drama that benefits from the presence of the great pairing of Karloff and Rathbone,as Mord the executioner and Richard ,respectively. It opens with an execution of a defeated Lancastrian lord during a moment of peace in the War of the Roses between Lancaster and York factions. Both the main villains share a common bond in both being physically flawed with Karloff/Mord having a clubfoot (Which he uses to great effect on a hapless page attempting to deliver a message!) In the hands of the capable director and the great star duo this modest budgeted epic delivers more than the ill-fated Alexander does. An interesting side note; Mr.Rathbone in a later interview said that the extras were wearing papier mache as a substitute for the real thing (modest budget) one of the battle scenes took place in the rain so there was the images of Yorkist and Lancaster men-at-arms flailing away in melting armor with soggy weapons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No, It's not Shakespeare. Nor is it supposed to be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's unfair to compare this horror movie of the pre-WW2 vintage to Richard III of the Bard. While the Tower of London builds on Shakespeare's vilification of Richard III, this tale is much more of a dark genre that was popular at that time and which continued up until after WW2. These are the days of Revenge of the Cat People, Frankenstein and its sequels and other films that strike the mood of those post depression times. The censors of the time forbade any explicit sex or violence and what you saw was always highly stylized. However, presenting a stylized horror film, mild, if not downright tame, by today's standards, required a great deal of subtlety from the actors, which is something sadly lacking in today's slice 'n dice menus. These new horror films are so predictable and rely on gore and explicit violence to provide the thrill which like pornography requires each new presentation to up the ante in mindless antics, each trying to out-gross the previous. So, what have we here in this fine old film. The classic tale of Richard Crook-back. We have the great Basil Rathbone as the Black Duke and Boris Karloff as his fictional sidekick, Mord. Yes, Karloff is nearly a stereotype for the evil henchmen who's willing to carry out the furious demands of his heartless master. But, there's a young Vinnie Price as the Duke of Clarence awaiting a drowning in a vat of Mumsey wine. The action line of this classic story moves quickly, the lines are spoken clearly and the the acting is superb. What else do you want from a 1939 horror drama?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All the King's Madmen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not really a horror film, but a uniquely sinister and highly compelling history lesson, this late 1930's Universal production brings together a marvelous cast and tells a rather loose interpretation of William Shakespeare's famous play "Richard III". It's once again Boris Karloff's charismatic face that parades the DVD-cover, but the true personification of greed and wickedness here comes from the fantastic Basil Rathbone, who plays Richard the Duke of Gloucester and brother to Edward; King of England. Richard already heavily influences all the king's decisions, but he wants to reign by himself and thinks of fiendish plans to eliminate all those preceding him in line of the throne. He even owns a miniature theater where his progress to owning the royal crown is illustrated by dolls! Richard most loyal partner in crime is the barbaric and uncanny looking executioner Mord, performed by Boris Karloff. And yet another icon of horror cinema can be found in the cast list, moreover in the earliest phase of his rich career, namely Vincent Price. He splendidly gives image to the Duke of Clarence and appears in the film's absolute best sequence where he and Richard hold an unfair drinking contest. The story is sometimes confusing and not entirely without flaws, but the wholesome is very atmospheric and suspenseful. Near the beginning there's a morbid execution sequence and later in the film there are two spectacular and typically medieval battle scenes. The costumes and settings were convincing enough for me and every line that comes out of Rathbone's mouth is a fascinating experience. Roger Corman re-told this story in 1962, again starring Vincent Price, although that version put the emphasis more on explicit torture and supernatural elements. Very much recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tower of London is as sinister as Basil Rathbone, Boris Karloff and the rest of Universal's horror department can make it. Although the picture is not without its weaknesses, lack of thrills is not one of them. Neither is the casting--Rathbone and Karloff are savage enough to please the most bloodthirsty. Karloff enjoys his role as executioner and spends plenty of time in his torture chamber.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing Like Olivier's film, but a good, workmanlike horror flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are several reasons to recall "Tower Of London". It gave Basil Rathbone one of his few chances to portray a character that could be compared to Lawrence Olivier's portrayal in another film of the same character. It had a performance by John Rodion, Rathbone's illegitimate son, who tried to follow his father's footsteps into movies but was ultimately unable to do so. It was one of the few films that Rathbone did with Boris Karloff (others being "Son Of Frankenstein" and "The Comedy Of Terrors"). It was, I believe, the first film that Rathbone did with Vincent Price (oddly enough some twenty three years later Price appeared as Richard III, in a remake of this film). There is a story that Rathbone tells in his memoirs, "In And Out Of Character", of a practical joke played by himself and Karloff on Price. Price here was playing "false, perjured Clarence", that is George, Duke of Clarence, the middle brother between Edward IV and Richard III. The Duke of Clarence was in the Tower of London, charged with treason, when he died suddenly - reputedly he was purposely drowned in a "butt of Malmesey Wine" (a barrel of wine). Clarence, historically, was a very untrustworthy figure, who kept switching sides to better himself at everyone else's expense. In reality he was probably executed for treason. But rumor about the odd death in the barrel of wine spread, and eventually his death was thought to be due to the evil plotting of his brother Richard. When the film was shot, Rowland V. Lee (the director) decided that wine could not be used for the barrel's liquid - it would be wasted and was too expensive. He used Coca Cola, which is dark looking like a dessert wine. Price had to be tipped upside down into the barrel full of this Coke, and hold his breath for about a minute, and then be pulled out. He was shot a few times to be sure they got the best take for the film. Then he was taken out of the barrel, and was resting when Rathbone and Karloff came over - they gave Price a bottle of Coke to drink and relax with!The film has some novel touches in it, none of which are remotely true. Miles Mander's King Henry VI is killed by order of Richard while he is praying. Henry VI did die violently in the Tower of London in 1471, shortly after the failure of the attempt by Warwick the "Kingmaker" to restore him and the Lancastrians to the throne at the battle of Tewksberry. More likely, though, he was dispatched by order of King Edward IV. There was no box of wax dolls that Richard kept to remove the dolls representing the rivals he had knocked off. Mord is apparently a figment of the movie writer's imagination - no British monarch ever boasted of using a hangman to climb the genealogical tree to become king. Finally, I don't think that Richard's older brother, Edward IV (Ian Hunter), was such a ninny as to wink at Richard's acts of villainy as matters to laugh about while such a character came closer and closer to threatening the succession of Edward's own sons.For all the errors, it is stylistically a good film, with Rathbone at his wormiest as the ultimate bad uncle and usurper. Karloff's Mord is one of the few villain's he played with absolutely no good points to his character.It's not "Richard III", wherein Olivier (with Shakespeare) looks at the soul of a demonic villain. But as a good programmer it was worth watching.About eleven days ago was August 22, 2006, the anniversary of the Battle of Bosworth Field, the battle where Richard and his cause fell in 1485, destroyed by Henry Tudor. As it does every year, the "Richard III Society" put a notice in the death columns of the New York Times regarding the sad fate of the monarch, and concerning loyalty (Richard's death in battle is tied to the opportunistic switch in loyalties of the Earl of Stanley and his men in the battle). I still hope that one day some serious film director will try to produce a film version of Richard's career and story that shows that the evidence that he killed his nephews and most of those other "victims" is not proved and probably was not done by him. But I wonder if such a film as that would turn out to be acceptable with the public, which is now used to seeing Richard III as always being a super-villain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Tower of London" was made by the same Director (Rowland V. Lee) and the same stars (Basil Rathbone, Boris Karloff), that had made "Son of Frankenstein earlier the same year.This is the story of the evil King Richard III's (Rathbone) rise to the throne of England in the 15th century. We learn that Richard (known as crooked back because of a deformity) as the Duke of Gloucester is sixth in the line of succession. Standing in his way are his brother King Edward IV (Ian Hunter), the feeble minded King Henry VI (Miles Mander) who is being kept prisoner, the Prince of Wales, Edward's two young sons and Richard's other brother the Duke of Clarence (Vincent Price).With his faithful servant, the club-footed executioner Mord (Karloff) Richard begins to destroy all who stand in his way. Queen Elizabeth's (Barbara O'Neill) nephew John Wyatt (John Sutton) refuses to marry the King's choice, preferring instead the Queen's lovely handmaiden Lady Alice Barton (Nan Grey) instead. Wyatt is imprisoned and tortured, however, the Queen aids his escape. Wyatt escapes to France and plots the overthrow of Edward with Henry Tudor (Ralph Forbes).Meanwhile, Richard has started to move up the line of succession. First to go is Henry who has emerged as a hero following his survival in a battle in which he was supposed to be killed. The Prince of Wales is killed in the battle. The Duke of Clarence is drowned in a barrel of wine and ultimately Edward dies of natural causes.Richard is appointed Prortector of the two young princes (Ronald Sinclair, John-Herbert Bond). He soon proclaims himself king and to be sure has Mord murder the two young princes.Wyatt returns to England to claim his bride. After stealing the King's treasure Wyatt returns to France and turns the treasure over to Henry Tudor. Tudor mounts an invasion of England and......Director Lee gives us a couple of exciting battle sequences over the course of the film. The murder of the two young princes cements the true evil of Richard.Rathbone's character is behind Price's in the line of succession, which would make him younger. Rathbone however, was almost 20 years older than price. Karloff has merely a supporting role here but does his best as the evil Mord. John Rodian who plays Lord DeVere who is executed at the start of the film was Rathbone's real life son.Karloff and Price would not work together again until 1963's "The Raven" for Roger Corman. Price had starred in the remake of "The Tower of London" in a low budget re-make, also for Corman in 1962. Price, Karloff and Rathbone, appeared together in Corman's "The Comedy of Terrors" (1964).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Ain't Richard III, or Is It?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When one has seen the Shakespearean treatment of this story, it falls far short of the masterwork. That said, it isn't fair to compare a low budget period movie to Shakespeare. I think what I did like about it, though, is its visuality. I liked Karloff going through a day's work, putting one more weight on a guy they're suffocating, like a cook checking to see if there's enough salt in the soup. I really like Basil Rathbone. Of course the Sherlock Holmes movies are my favorites, but he is a consummate actor and rises above everyone else in the story. I was disappointed in the lack of character development other than Richard and the silly romantic subplot.Karloff ,also, should have had his moment to confront Richard since he is a fictionalization anyway.It was neat seeing Vincent Price begin his mugging, whining characterization of the ineffectual son of the king. I did like the drinking scene but wonder why no one else was there to observe the result. Richard (Rathbone) seemed to have an awfully easy row to hoe. I was also disappointed in the big battle scene at the end, but won't spoil it here.All in all, I liked looking at this movie, but felt sort of empty at the conclusion. Also, where does it come off as a horror movie, other than the rather comical dungeon scenes?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rathbone and Karloff in chilling historical melodrama...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The bloody history of England has always been a ripe subject for films and this one is no exception. BASIL RATHBONE has quite a field day playing the ruthless and unscrupulous man who would later become Richard III and BORIS KARLOFF is his faithful executioner in this story of royalty run amok.Rathbone is willing to commit murders brutal and grotesque in order to stop anyone else from getting in the way of the throne. But the film is flawed by a muddled script which has to deal with too much exposition in the way of explaining all the character relationships and the various nobles involved.Karloff is quite effective as the executioner but really has little to do except sharpen his blades and deal roughly with various prisoners. It's not the sort of role he could really do anything deeper with. VINCENT PRICE shows promise in a good supporting role as Edward. He has an unforgettable scene in a wine contest with Rathbone wherein he eventually falls into a drunken stupor and is thrown into a vat of wine by Karloff and Rathbone.JOHN SUTTON at least gets more screen exposure than he usually got in his early years as a second string actor, mostly in Warner films with Flynn and Davis. NAN GREY does nicely as his loyal sweetheart who is reunited with him for the finale.Not quite as chilling today as it was when I saw it years ago and much of it is too labored with exposition of historical facts.TCM is showing an excellent print that demonstrates how expertise the cameramen were with their B&amp;W cinematography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An appropriately towering performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ambitious, historical tale with lots of battles (fairly well done) and much power struggling, particularly of course by the hunchbacked Richard. The matters romantic slow things down enormously and although clearly striving for some measure of authenticity, there are just too many characters for the budget or script to be able to deal with as one might have liked. However, given the limited resources, a reasonable result is achieved, helped enormously by three excellent male leads. Basil Rathbone is very fine indeed and very convincing in the role of the scheming, Richard and none of the camp Price would bring to the role another time. A very young Vincent price is also most effective and it is great to see his crooked smile and fluttering eyelids already swinging into action. A bit too fey here perhaps but lets himself go in the infamous drinking scene. Incidental to the main story and probably originally added as a bit of light relief, Boris Karloff brings anything but. An appropriately towering performance and despite very few lines and not a lot of screen time he drags himself into centre frame and haunts one's memory afterwards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Rowland J. Lee takes a few pages from English history to tell the story of Richard the III. A sick, misshaped, ambitious and evil man who would stop at nothing to usurp the Throne of England. As Richard of Gloucester (Basil Rathbone) designs an ambitious and dastardly plan by which he will seek to destroy all who would stand in his way to be king of England. With his equally sinister henchman (Boris Karloff) he creates a tiny miniature stage on which all who must die are systematically remove. This includes the rightful sons of Queen Elizabeth (Barbara O'Neil) together with Edward IV (Ian Hunter) and the Duke of Clarence (Vincent Price). The superb cast included Leo G. Carroll as Lord Hastings. Like the black pages of a Gothic novel, the selected cast prove a fitting tribute to those who lent their talents to create this film Classic for the entertainment of audiences everywhere. Recommended for all who enjoy English drama at it's best. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>90 minutes of brutality and darkness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon first viewing, I didn't warm up to "Tower of London" much. The story of 15th century political intrigue wasn't exactly what I was looking for when popping in a quote-unquote Universal Horror movie. This is, after all, the same historical material that inspired Shakespeare's "Richard III" and modern soap opera "The Tudors." Rewatching this movie tonight, I discovered, surprise surprise, it is a horror movie, at least parts of it anyway.Granted, a large portion of the film revolves around royal politics. There's lots of talks of familial relations, of marrying the right people, of who's next in line to the throne. As generally accepted by fiction, but not necessarily history, Richard III murdered his way up the royal line, all the way to the king's throne. In tradition with Shakespeare, Basil Rathbone's portray of Richard includes a hunchback. After the exile of Henry Tudor and the death of his mingling brother Edward, the film shows Richard's inclinations for murderous conspiracies kick in.And that's were the film's horror elements come from. The film invents the character of Mord, a royal executioner with a clubfoot, childhood friend of Richard, played by Karloff. Mord is one of Karloff's most sadistically evil characters. Karloff's head is shaved and his all ready imposing frame is further padded out, making him look especially intimidating. This is a man who gleefully grinds an axe before the gallows, has no qualms about stabbing an old man while he prays. Interestingly enough, Mord is also responsible for spreading rumors, gossip that slowly erodes at the public's trust of Prince Edward V and his brother. Richard's manipulation of the boys takes up a large portion of the film's middle section. The moment Rathbone first considers murdering the children even causes Karloff's totally immoral character to pause for a second. The scene where the boy princes are killed has got to be one of the darkest moments in Post-Code thirties cinema.This is largely an actor's film. Rathbone gives an interesting performance. Richard III is never more then a calculating villain. Even his generous public area or the scenes with the woman he plans on marrying are never more then mechanical moves towards power. It's still a very good performance, strictly because Rathbone imbues every line and turn with a sinister attitude. Among the supporting cast is a very young Vincent Price as Duke George, played here as a foppish alcoholic. The best scene in the movie is the drink-off, like a duel but with booze, between Rathbone and Price. Another example of two great actors playing it over the top against one another. There's some dark comedy sprinkled throughout too, most of it coming from Mord's causal brutality, such as opening a iron maiden and letting a body fall out as calmly as you and I take the garbage out.The horror content peaks during the scene where a prisoner of the Tower is tortured for information. Whipping, hot irons, the rack, all of it displayed in as much graphic detail as 1939 would allow. (Which might be more then you'd think.) Could the roots of post-millennial torture horror be in this little seen period drama? Probably not, but it's fun to think so. The story climaxes with a huge battle scene, which is fine but marks the end of the horror elements. Rathbone is given a surprisingly lackluster death scene but Karloff's dramatic dive off a cliff makes up for it. After 90 minutes of brutality and darkness, the overly up-beating ending is a real tone breaker. "Tower of London" honestly isn't pure horror but, every time I see the film, I'm surprise at how closely it skirts up against the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A deranged Lord splendidly performed by Basil Rathbone relentlessly murdering his way to the throne</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The picture begins with a foreword : ¨No age is without its ruthless men -who , in their search for power , leave dark stains upon the pages of history . During the Middle Ages -to seize the tower of London was to seize the throne of England . In 1471 this has been done by Edward IV (Ian Hunter)- who has violently deposed the feeble Henry IV (Miles Mander) and holds him prisoner . Within the deep shadows of the Tower walls lives the population of a small city , some in prison cells and torture chambers , some in palaces and spacious lodgings , but none in peace . A web of intrigue veils the lives of all who know only too well that today's friends might be tomorrow's enemies¨ . As this excellent film tells the story of power-hungry Richard III Crookback (an incisive Basil Rathbone who features an acclaimed acting) , 6th in throne succession , subsequent and eventually crowned king , the English monarch who brutally executed the people who attempted to get in way to the throne . Richard eliminates those ahead of him in succession to the throne, then occupied by his brother King Edward IV of England. Richard , Duke of Gloucester , is a dominant , unstoppable , mean lord , gross black spider of a figure that devours or possesses everything on its path . After the death of Edward he becomes Richard III, King of England, and he needs only defeat the exiled Henry Tudor to retain power . Deformed and ruthless English king Richard battles Prince of Wales' army , as the opposing forces converge in Gloucester-shire and the Prince prays for victory at the Priory of Hereford . This melodrama is based on historical events , during Two Roses War , ¨Red Rose (York)¨ ruled by Edward IV and Richard III followers and ¨White Rose (Lancaster)¨ Henry VII followers who vanquish them . There finally takes place battle of Bosworth , in which Richard III is defeated and takes over the kingdom , a new ruler named Henry VII Tudor.Dazzling , hypnotic entertainment that was deemed extremely graphic for its time and some of the torture scenes had to be cut before it was released . More interested as historical drama than as a terror film , the picture profits from a magnificent cast who gives over-the-top interpretations . Well produced and atmospheric picture , being stunningly directed by Rowland V .Lee , which gives Boris Karloff one of his best characters as the shaven-headed executioner who looks like a forerunner of ulterior roles . Gorgeously polished visuals are perfect foil for the slimy , evil goings-on . The battle scenes were an ordeal to film. Principally shot on August 19, 1939 at a ranch in Tarzana, the fog machine proved ineffective in the face of high winds. The 100-degree heat caused the 300 extras to suffer and rain machines caused the soldier's cardboard helmets and shields to disintegrate. Additional battle scenes were shot on August 22 and on September 4, 1939, but the California heat continued to play havoc with the cast, crew and equipment . Production wrapped on 4 September 1939, 10 days and nearly $80,000 over budget . Tremendous black and white cinematography by George Robinson and stunning dramatic impact in one of the most successful Universal films ever made . Good musical score , though studio heads were alarmed that the score contained nothing but period music and ordered a new score be written ; time considerations ultimately prevented this, with Frank Skinner cobbling together pieces from his score from The son of Frankenstein , only pieces of the original score survived the final cut. Other films dealing with this historic personage are the followings : ¨Tower of London¨(1962) by Roger Corman with Vincent Price as Richard III , Michael Pate , Sandra Knight ; it results to be a sophisticated remake and Price plays a role taken over in the 1939 rendition who coincidentally appeared as the doomed Duke of Clarence ; the classic ¨Richard III¨ (1955) starred and directed by Laurence Olivier with Ralph Richardson , John Gielgud , Cedric Hardwicke , this is the landmark version of the Shakespearean play . And modern take ¨Richard III (1995) by Richard Loncraine with Ian Mckellen , Jim Broadbent , Robert Downey Jr and Nigel Hawthorne , being set in an imagined 1930s London of swanky Art Deco .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atmospheric History Lesson With Three Of Horror's All-Time Greats</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rowland V. Lee's "Tower of London" of 1939 is a tense, well-made and highly atmospheric Historical Drama starring three of Horror's all time-greats, Basil Rathbone (in the lead as the vicious King Richard III), Boris Karloff (as his loyal executioner), and the young Vincent Price (in the role of the Duke of Clarence). Even though the film is sometimes labeled a Horror film, it isn't really. Personally, I saw Roger Corman's 1962 remake, in which Vincent Price plays the leading role, several years before first watching this one. I'd probably say I still prefer Corman's version, due to the creepy atmosphere, the stronger focus on the 'Horror' elements and Richard's growing madness, and, mainly, due to Vincent Price's indescribable on-screen persona. It cannot really be said which is the 'better' film however. Though telling the story of the same King, the two versions do differ immensely in most aspects. They begin at a different stage in Richard's aspiration for power, and while Richard is depicted as an absolute madman by Vincent Price in Corman's 1962 film, the Richard played by Basil Rathbone in this film is merely a calculating, unscrupulous and extremely cold-blooded aspirator for kingship.Lee's "The Tower of London" begins within the reign of King Edward IV (Ian Hunter), the older brother of Richard, Duke of Gloucester (Basil Rathbone). The unscrupulous, hunchbacked Richard longs to be King, and is willing to commit any murderous deed necessary to achieve his goal. He is assisted in his plans by his most loyal servant, the club-footed executioner and torturer Mord (Boris Karloff)... "Tower of London" is definitely a dark, gloomy film, and furthermore very explicitly violent for its time. Unlike Roger Corman's 1962 version it is not a Horror film, however, but a Historical Drama. The great Basil Rathbone is ingeniously sinister in his role, and Horror-deity Boris Karloff is incredible as the ghoulish executioner. Vincent Price's role of the Duke of Clarence is regrettably small, but he is brilliant in it, as always. A 28-year-old Price, who was not yet the Horror-icon he would become, gives a great foretaste of the brilliance to come. Most (though not all) of the supporting performances are good. The 'good guys', such as the hero played by John Sutton, are not too memorable, but, at least in my humble opinion, great villains are of far greater value for this kind of story anyway. Though it treats the eponymous King, "Tower of London" is not based on Willaim Shakespeare's play "Richard III". The film is greatly shot, the choreography is very good and the historical settings are incredible. Overall, "Tower of London" is an excellent film that shouldn't be missed by fans of classic cinema. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delicious macabre thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released the same year as 'Son of Frankenstein' it reunites the creative talents behind that film Karloff, Rathbone, and director Rowland V. Lee. It's arguable as to whether or not this counts as a horror film really but if it you do it is by far Universal's largest macabre spectacle. It's a loose retelling of the legend of Richard III with Rathbone in the title role and Rathbone might be delivering his finest performance. He totally gets the two faced nature of the character. You have to like something about Richard in some regard otherwise the story just stretches plausibility too much. Rathbone might actually have it harder in that this is not Shakespeare and there is no direct address to the audience. The film benefits as well from having Ian Hunter being a very strong Edward IV. He isn't a total pushover and the scenes between him and Rathbone show two smart men with Rathbone just having the cunning Edward IV does not.Karloff is unfortunately relegated to nothing more than the basest of supporting roles. He plays Mord Richard's personal executioner who does the dirty deed of killing the princes in the tower. It's a role that could have stood to be expanded. Mord too is disfigured with a club foot and that seems to be why he idolizes Richard and is willing to murder all his enemies. I think it would have been interesting to see Karloff's character become disillusioned in his hero at some point. The most disappointing Karloff pictures are the ones where Karloff is there merely to look sinister and 'Tower of London' follows that formula unfortunately. That being said Mord has one outstanding moment. He doesn't receive much dialogue but there his introduction is brilliant. "Your highness, you're more than a duke, more than a king. You're a god to me!"It isn't really a horror picture but it's a pretty good historical epic and easily one of Universal's biggest films of the period. These sets were recycled in a lot of later films. Look out for Vincent Price as the Duke of Clarence. This has to be his first or second film. They are still thinking he could be a romantic instead of a heavy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great For What It Is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 15th century Richard Duke of Gloucester (Basil Rathbone), aided by his club-footed executioner Mord (Boris Karloff), eliminates those ahead of him in succession to the throne, then occupied by his brother King Edward IV of England.This film has suffered from being thought of as horror, probably because it has Vincent Price (in a very early role) and Boris Karloff. It is not horror. Some have taken to calling it "quasi-horror", which may be true, though exactly what that means is not clear so who is to say? Anyway, if you go in expecting horror, you will leave disappointed.As a historical drama, this is an exceptional film. If you do not know English royal history, the characters are more than a little confusing. But if you go in understanding the basic plot, it is a great tale of treachery and evil ambition. And, for the most part, a true story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film in spite of any historical inaccuracies. If you watch the film as simply a Hollywood drama instead of "historical truth" then the movie is quite enjoyable to watch.Basil Rathbone &amp; Boris Karloff are in what might be their most wicked and vile roles ever! Rathbone plays Richard - Duke of Gloucester while Karloff plays the chief gaolor of the Tower &amp; executioner Mord.The movie is not considered to be a horror film yet it feels much like watching a historical horror-drama similar to watching the unrelated film "Tower of London (1962)" which also stars Vincent Price. ToL '62 is a completely different story than this Rathbone, Karloff and Price classic from '39."Tower of London (1939)" is worth watching for the fans of horror, historical dramas, Rathbone, Karloff and/or Price.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All in all, this oddball 90-minutes could be called a noir costume drama. The lighting is either dull gray, shadowy b&amp;w, or plain foggy, all the way through. Of course, this befits a very dour tale based, it seems, on some historical fact. As the scheming Richard of Gloucester, the sharp-featured Rathbone is perfect. And by golly, nothing's going to stand in the way of his becoming a 15th century King of England, even if he has to step on half his family to get there. Of course, he's got reliable old clubfoot Mord (Karloff) to do the dirty work. And do it, he does.It's impressive how well Rathbone transitions here from the unscrupulous plotter to his later intellectual gumshoe Sherlock Holmes. There's been no one quite so compelling before or since. Then too, as Mord, the great Karloff makes better use of his massive frame than usual. With his bald head (though the skull cap seams sometimes show), he's an incomparable presence. Still, there's that fleeting moment where the murderous Mord contemplates the sleeping bodies of the two doomed princes and the cruelty of his work. It passes quickly but amounts to a telling touch. Then there's that memorable scene where the Duke of Clarence (Price) and Richard compete for most quaffed wine in royal history; that is, before Clarence gets to bathe in the vat permanently. Though I've never again heard of Malmsey kind of wine, that scene's stayed with me for years.In my little book, director Lee is underrated for his work here and in other costume epics he seems to have specialized in, e.g. Captain Kidd (1945). Nonetheless, the movie is flawed in certain respects, as other reviewers point out. There's a heckuva lot of characters that come and go, so you may need the proverbial scorecard. Plus, the royalty gets their finery to wear, but the bare-bones interiors look like the budget didn't cover set decoration. And I'm still wondering how combatants could tell friend from foe in those fog shrouded battle scenes that come across like cloudy nightmares.Anyhow, I know nothing about the historical accuracy of what's on screen. Nonetheless, the oddball results have stayed with me for near 6-decades. Thanks, Rathbone and Karloff, and especially a long-gone TV Late Show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shakespeare -- Universal Pictures style! Basil Rathbone plays Richard III, who rises to power with the help of his club-footed executioner Mord, played by Boris Karloff ("crookback and dragfoot"). Excellent historical suspenser from Universal. Not a horror movie, despite the cast and studio. Although Karloff's Mord would be right at home lurking around Castle Frankenstein. In addition to Karloff and Rathbone, the cast includes Vincent Price, Leo G. Carroll, Ian Hunter, and lovely Nan Grey. Great sets, costumes, and direction by Rowland V. Lee. Rathbone is having lots of fun being evil and Karloff is always a treat to watch. I really like this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historical sibling horror from the Brothers Lee</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1939's "Tower of London" was a Universal 'A' budget picture, director Rowland V. Lee's followup to "Son of Frankenstein," as conceived by his brother Robert N. Lee, who also scripted Rowland's final feature in 1945, "Captain Kidd." Together, they chose a real-life horror story set in 14th century Britain, the throne usurped by three brothers, immortalized by Shakespeare's "Richard III." Wearing the crown is King Edward IV (Ian Hunter), his closest adviser brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester (Basil Rathbone), while half brother George, Duke of Clarence (Vincent Price), is regarded as a self serving weakling. Few are aware of Richard's own aspirations toward the throne, though Edward's wife, Queen Elyzabeth (Barbara O'Neil), correctly suspects that Gloucester is not the loving uncle her sons believe him to be. Boris Karloff's Mord is the chief executioner, ruling over the Tower of London, where all of Richard's enemies eventually end up. The first victim opening the film is played by John Rodion, Basil Rathbone's son from his first marriage, whose only other credit was also with his father (1938's "The Dawn Patrol"). The wine jousting death of Clarence is memorable (borrowed by Price himself in 1973's "Theater of Blood"), but by far the most shocking are the cold blooded murders of Edward's two sons, the boy King having taken his father's place upon the throne, only for Richard to order their deaths in striking back at the defiant Queen Mother. Karloff preferred the term 'terror' over the word 'horror' in describing his films, but surely would have had no problem describing this movie as a genuine 'horror film.' Basil Rathbone enjoys one of his greatest screen roles, handsome and resplendent, his humpback barely noticeable. Having debuted in Universal's 'Service De Luxe,' Vincent Price (in only his third feature) would finish his brief sojourn at the studio following "Green Hell," "The Invisible Man Returns," and "The House of the Seven Gables," moving on to 20th Century-Fox for "Hudson's Bay." Splendidly hamming it up in this first brush with the genre he became indelibly linked, Price actually graduated to starring as Richard himself in Roger Corman's impoverished 1962 remake, also titled "Tower of London." Price would also be reunited with John Sutton in "The Invisible Man Returns," "Bagdad," "The Bat," and "Return of the Fly."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Basil Rathbone stars as Richard, the Duke Of Glouster, a ruthless and ambitious man who systematically plots to murder all those who stand in his way to the throne, held by King Edward the IV. He is helped in this by his loyal and sinister servant, the club-footed Mort(played menacingly by Boris Karloff) who tortures, imprisons or exiles all who oppose him. Eventually, Richard does come to power after Edward dies, becoming the famous King Richard the III of England, who must face a returning enemy in battle to secure his power, aided by the eager Mort... Vincent Price is amusing as a drunken Duke of Clarence, another victim. Good acting and direction(by Rowland V. Lee) with literate script make this film a winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shakespeare For Dummies (Like Me).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those who have seen Richard III as written by William Shakespeare (or even the updated version with Ian McKellan) will find this to be the "cliff notes" version of that classic play. Basil Rathbone, after going into the Bard with "Romeo and Juliet", now enters the world of one of the most vile rulers of England's history, a hunchback who basically killed off his entire family to rise to the thrown and only be knocked right back down again. It is obvious that historical villains like this keep winning on their rise to the top so their fall will only be greater, and that is the fate of the Duke of Glouchester who has too many steps in his way to get to the throne. His brother (Ian Hunter) has already usurped the throne, has two sons in line, followed by a cowardly brother (Vincent Price) who simultaneously hates and fears him at the same time. The Queen (Barbara O'Neil) senses that her two sons are in danger from their supposedly loving uncle, and other royal in-laws either go abroad or are executed to avoid the wrath of his ambition and the evil executioner (Boris Karloff).Poor Price gets the worst fate, a drinking contest which ends with a visit to the wine vats. How does Rathbone stay so sober? Perhaps, like a camel, he is able to store the wine in his hump. In real life, Richard III's hump was much more obvious than it was, maybe not as large as the one of the bell-ringer of Notre Dame, but certainly not as subtle as the one Rathbone has here. Not since Livia of "I Claudius" has someone dispatched so many relatives in an effort to get closer to the throne, and Duke Richard delightfully steps on as many heels as he can to get there. Even children aren't safe, and one poor child (delivering a message for a princess) feels the wrath and literally Karloff's boot while trying to get out of the castle.Handsomely made, this delightful epic may not be as poetic as Shakespeare, but it is certainly better than other historical epics who changed a lot of facts to add more drama to the plot. (Like this story could use any more drama...) Made just at the outbreak of war in Europe, I'm sure this was seen as a warning to Hitler and Mussolini that previous ruthless leaders ultimately fell. It is ironic that Price (playing the Duke of Clarence) ends up in the hunchback costume years later when American International filmed its own version of the story that was a bit darker, if not even more camp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three great performances in a decent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tower of London is not exactly great by all means. The script does feel rather muddled, the pacing is uneven with some scenes that feel rushed and others that plod and the romantic subplot is just silly. However, it does look great, with striking cinematography and appropriately creepy settings. Frank Skinner's music gives a haunting edge and the memorable but here often grim story is full of great scenes, the two battles are spectacular, while the murders of Clarence and the two Princes are unforgettable. The whole cast give good performances, especially Leo G.Carroll, who makes any supporting character more interesting than it is. But there are three performances that are great. Basil Rathbone is a brilliant Richard, he dominates every scene he's in in every way and he never resorts to camp. Boris Karloff, with the bald head and clubbed foot, is terrifying as the Exexutioner, while Vincent Price's Clarence, the actor in a very early role and he went on to give even better performances, is memorable. So all in all, a decent film but elevated by some unforgettable scenes and three great performances. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tower of London is directed by Rowland V. Lee and written by Robert N. Lee. It stars Basil Rathbone, Boris Karloff, Vincent Price, Barbara O'Neil and Ian Hunter. Music is collaborated by Ralph Freed, Hans J. Salter and Frank Skinner and cinematography by George Robinson.Out of Universal Pictures, film is a reworking of how Richard III (Rathbone) rose to become King of England by scheming and killing off those ahead of him in line to the throne.No square headed or fang sprouting monsters in this Universal Picture, this is about human monsters, splendidly played out with historical observation. It's 1471 and we are involved in shifty shenanigans, torture, war, infanticide and depravity. All played out amongst classic Universal backdrops; of which the titular Tower is a prominently gloomy force. There's much decadence to be found and gruesome deaths are interlaced with medieval malarkey such as a wine drinking competition to the death! Some deliciously macabre scenes land in the conscious and stay there, none more so than with Richard's returning visits to his Royal figurines! All good dastardly fun.Story has a lot going on, so paying attention is heartily recommended to get the best out of Lee's screenplay. Characterisations are rich with period flavours, especially the villains, where Rathbone is wide eyed, edgy and maniacal, and the irrepressible Karloff a hulking grotesque who takes pride in his position as chief torturer. Robinson's photography is suitably atmospheric, with the misty marsh laden battle at the finale particularly striking: the latter of which also finding director Lee on good camera form as he fluidly tracks the mud, blood and swinging of steel.Sure some of it's unintentionally smile inducing, and that final battle needed to be considerably longer, but all told it's classical period stuff that does have some serious humanistic themes at its core. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modest historical film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tower of London (1939) Directed and Produced by Roland V. Lee. Starring Basil Rathbone, Boris Karloff Barbara O'Neil, Ian Hunter, Vincent Price, Nan Grey, Leo G. Carroll, John Sutton, Miles Mander, and Donnie Dunagan (for some reason I can't stop laughing at those two names being together).The opening music in Tower of London would tell you that it's a horror film. The truth of the matter is, that Tower of London isn't much of a horror film, as it a historical piece. Despite the presence of Boris Karloff, Vincent Price and yes Basil Rathbone (he did some Horror films), this is attempting to be more straight than scary. The film is more or less a retelling of Richard iii (Rathbone) attempts to conquer the throne in England during the 15th century, by any means necessary. Richard is joined by his loyal executioner Mord (Karloff). It is a story of betrayal, power, and descent into madness. It is an interesting retelling, but does have some differences.Released the same year as Son of Frankenstein (both films feature the same two leads, Rathbone and Karloff). Tower of London was probably more or less an attempt to give Basil Rathbone a leading role, that wasn't Sherlock Holmes (this film even begins with Starring Basil Rathbone and then listing the rest of the cast members as with).This film features some fencing. With Rathbone being a naturally trained fencer, Roland V. Lee and the other people behind the film felt that they could probably get away with having fencing in the film (seeing as it was a common thing in that era). And the fights are pretty impressive, probably the best parts of the film, being extremely entertaining, as Richard likes to fence with other people.There is a particularly good scene where after King Henry death is announced, Richard goes to his room and there he set of a dolls lined up, these dolls all have something in common, they are people that he wants dead. With King Henry and two others descent for the throne having already been knocked out, he throws the dolls into the fire, and places the remaining heirs to the throne on top, plotting which one to kill next. The scene is particularly good, because it shows how far Richard will go just to ascend to the throne. The music that plays in the background is particularly good, giving the scene an eerie feeling.Three of the six actors in this film (Rathbone, Karloff and Price) would all reunite with the film, The Comedy of Terrors. A scene in that film mirrors this film, by having Price kill off Rathbone (after Rathbone wouldn't stop coming back to life).The scenery is terrific. It actually looks like we're in London in the 1400's.The acting is pretty good with Rathbone as usual perfect in the role of the sinister Richard the iii, with Karloff just as equally good in the role of his henchman Mord, who is sinister and freaky. Vincent Price is good in a small role, which was one of his earliest films. Here he plays the Duke of Clarence who meets gets challenged to a drinking contest by his brother Richard the iii (you heard me right), that ends with one survivor. Although Price is commonly associated with low-brow horror films, one must not forget that Price started as a serious dramatic supporting actor (including appearances in films such as Laura, and Dragonwyck, and then became started making horror films in the 50's. Another good performance in the film is Ian Hunter as King Edward IV. Here he is depicted as being stronger than what he was in say the Shakespeare play, Richard the iii.The film was remade in 1962 by Roger Corman (although maybe in name only). Ironically enough this time it starred Vincent Price in the role of Richard.All and all the Tower of London is fairly entertaining. I wouldn't call it the most accurate retelling of a historical event, but I wouldn't call it the worst. The acting makes up for most of its fault and for the most part, I suggest it worth a look. Of course I don't like the fact that people label this as a horror film, as there's nothing really scary about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Basil Rathbone gives a sublimely wicked performance as the cunning and ruthless Richard, the Duke of Glouster, who bumps off various members of the royal family in order to become king. Richard is assisted in his vicious quest by cruel and loyal club-footed executioner Mord (a perfectly fearsome portrayal by a bald and hulking Boris Karloff). Director Rowland V. Lee, working from an engrossing script by Robert N. Lee, relates the complex and compelling plot full of betrayal and treachery at a steady pace, delivers a convincing and flavorsome evocation of the 15th century setting, and stages a few battle set pieces with real aplomb. Moreover, this movie does a potent job of showing the brutal extremes one will resort to acquire great power (Richard even has two little boys murdered!). The cast have a grand old time with the meaty material, with stand-out contributions from John Sutton as the dashing John Wyatt, Barbara O'Neil as the proud Queen Elyzabeth, Ian Hunter as the shrewd and hearty King Edward, Vincent Price as the cowardly and effeminate George, the Duke of Clarence (George's high stakes wine drinking stand-off with Richard rates as one of the film's definite highlights); Nan Grey as the lovely Alice Barton, Ernest Cossart as merry chimney sweeper Tom Clink, and Miles Mander as the feeble King Henry VI. George Robinson's sharp cinematography makes neat use of graceful fades and dissolves. Frank Skinner's lively and rousing score does the stirring trick. Well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to see the story of Richard III without the Elizabethan speech of Shakespeare than this is the film for you. Tower Of London was made economically and is a great example of what you could do on a limited budget.In fact the film is essentially the story that Laurence Olivier used in filming his acclaimed version of Richard even to the extent of using the ending of Henry VI Part Three in the story as well.The Gothic sets that Universal Pictures had for horror films served well in Tower Of London. I always have to admire the use of darkness and mist during the battle sequences for Tewksbury and Bosworth Field with the addition of rain for Tewksbury. Gave the illusion of the cast of thousands without the DeMille like thousands. Maybe three or four dozen extras. Gave it a noir like quality.Basil Rathbone plays Richard III, one of history's frightening figures, courtesy of Williams Shakespeare's play. The dialog isn't Shakespearean, but Rathbone gets Shakespeare's point across. The evil genius who methodically disposes of all who are between him and the throne of England, the last of course being the child king Edward V and his younger brother. Rathbone's one and only true friend and chief aide in his designs is the club footed Boris Karloff playing the executioner at the Tower Of London. Karloff is a monster, but a most human one indeed.Ian Hunter and Vincent Price play Rathbone's older brothers, Edward IV and the Duke of Clarence respectively. Hunter pretty much fills out how history has made Edward IV come down to us, the hale and hearty king who liked to indulge in the vices a little too much, but who comparatively speaking was one of the better medieval kings England had. The Duke of Clarence was as Price plays him as well, a treacherous coward and weakling who may have not died in a vat of Malmsey wine, but who certainly wasn't missed by too many people when he did leave this mortal coil.John Sutton and Nan Grey play a pair of young lovers whose story is grafted into the Shakespearean plot. Their all right in that they don't get in the way of the real story. Three small roles that I liked very much were Barbara O'Neil as Queen Elizabeth Woodville, wife and later widow of Hunter, Ernest Cossart as the loyal chimney sweep who aids the anti-Richard cause, and Miles Mander most of all as the luckless and feckless Henry VI. For those who don't like to wade through Shakespeare and might have a term paper on Richard III due, Tower Of London almost functions like a Cliff's Notes brought to the big screen. Just don't use the Sutton and Grey characters in your paper and you might just get a passing grade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Tower of London" (Universal, 1939), directed by Rowland V. Lee, according to the original screenplay by Robert N. Lee, is an historical account based on the brutal rise to power of King Richard III. Mixing fact and fiction, "Tower of London" could easily be categorized as a Gothic horror tale due to the casting of Basil Rathbone, Boris Karloff and Vincent Price (in third film role), actors long associated in the horror genre. Aside from reuniting director Lee along with Rathbone and Karloff from "Son of Frankenstein" (1939), it also lifts the underscoring used from that same film. While there are no mad scientists, monsters or tales of the supernatural this time around, the horror is best described from its opening introduction: "No age is without its ruthless men ... who in their search for power, leave dark stains upon the pages of history ... during the middle ages ... to seize the throne of England. In 1471, this has been done by Edward IV ... who has violently deposed the feeble Henry VI and holds him prisoner. Within the deep shadows of the tower walls lives the population of a small city ... some in prison cells and torture chambers ... some in palaces and spacious lodgings ... but none in peace. A web of intrigue veils the lives of all who know only too well that today's friends might be tomorrow's enemies." Following its introductory of Queen Elyzabeth (Barbara O'Neil), wife of King Edward IV (Ian Hunter), as she bathes her three children, comes the main factor with characters of interest: Mord (Boris Karloff, in a standout performance), a sadistic executioner sharpening the blade of the headman's axe for his next victim on the chopping block. Working under direct orders of Edward's younger brother, Richard III (Basil Rathbone), Duke of Gloucester, Mord idolizes him with these words, "You are more than a Duke, more than a King ... you are a God to me." Equally villainous, Richard, who slowly schemes to take control of the throne, is seen to have miniature replicas of royal competitors he intends on destroying hidden in his secret cabinet, removing them one by one, throwing them into his fireplace once that mission is accomplished. The romantic interest falls upon Lady Alice Barton (Nan Grey) and John Wyatt (John Sutton), the latter whom Richard exiles to France. After the death of the Prince of Wales (G.P. Huntley Jr.), Richard tricks his widow, Anne Neville (Rose Hobart) into marrying him. Moving forward to 1483 as Richard takes control of the throne, he orders the execution of his two two young nephews, Prince Edward V (Ronald Sinclair) and Prince Richard (John Herbert Bond). Elizabeth sends for her exiled cousin, Wyatt, to help form a powerful army against Richard, which proves an impossible task after Wyatt's capture, imprisonment and extreme measures of punishment and flogging by the grinning Mord in the Tower of London.Containing many gory scenes, either suggested or acted out, the film's most famous sequence is the wine drinking contest between the cowardly Duke of Clarence (Vincent Price) and Richard, concluding with the unconscious Clarence being tossed into the large tank of Malmsey wine by Richard and Mord where, after shutting the lid, each listening patiently to the sound of the victim's last bubbling breath. According to Bob Dorian, former host of American Movie Classics where the film aired from 1994-1999, the scene came close to becoming reality where Price nearly drowned in the process when the lid was stuck shut. The same was said by Bob Osborne, host of Turner Classic Movies, when "Tower of London" made its TCM premiere October 23, 2006. In spite of his near death experience, it was Price who enacted the role of Richard III the 1962 remake. The actual battle sequences of Barnet, Tewkesbury and later Bosworth's Field are depicted here, but are briefly staged. With its straightforward dramatic theme, only Tom Clink (Ernest Cossart) and his chimney sweep boy assistant (Walter Tetley) offer some lighter comedic moments. The only thing missing is William Shakespeare's "Richard III" recital made famous by John Barrymore.A lavish scale production with sets that could have been replicas for the sound remake of "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," a production originally produced by Universal in 1923, but remade by RKO in 1939, "Tower of London", at 92 minutes, regardless of historical inaccuracies, is in a class by itself, thanks to the believable/ unsympathetic performances by Rathbone and Karloff, the noteworthy support of the aforementioned actors along with Leo G. Carroll (Lord Hastings), Lionel Bellmore (Beacon Chiruegeon), Ralph Forbes (Henry Tutor) and little Donnie Donegan (Prince Richard as a child) among others.Formerly distributed to home video in the 1990s, "Tower of London" can be found on DVD with Karloff's science fiction melodrama, "Night Key"(1937) on its flip side.

		<fullReview>As this film premiered a mere week after The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex, I can't help but think how the viewers compared the two historical spectacles. In this case Universal comes in second (as might be the case when you compete against Warner Bros) even though The Tower of London is great fun to watch. The ensemble of the male actors is perfect: Karloff, Rathbone and Price at one go means a good show. They look great and are well fit for historical parts. The ladies are, nevertheless, hideous. They are required to wear unidentified period costumes with weird wigs and head-gears combined with very thirties make-up which make them appear as some kind of crossbreeds between Isolde and Mickey Mouse. Perhaps the smell of mediocre production values could have been suffocated by the use of color photography, but alas, the b/w images never take off as they should. The film still moves along effortlessly and if you can look past the obvious thirties liberties taken with the subject and artwork - or indeed, if you enjoy these - then the film is a plate of definite dessert.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monstrous fun, with the Tudor version of Richard III slaying his nephews as well as a troublesome brother</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When that martyr to morality, that paragon of piety Sir Thomas More had his head chopped off by the order of his master, Henry VIII, it's unlikely in those last moments that he asked forgiveness for the sliming of Richard III's reputation, which he accomplished while ambitiously working to curry favor with the Tudors. Richard was the last of the Yorkist line, a capable and honest king, as ruthless in politics as everyone else was at that time, and most likely, if he had not taken action, to lose his own head to the machinations of the Woodvilles, the family of Queen Elizabeth, widow of Edward IV, Richard's brother, and mother to the two young princes who were the immediate heirs to the throne when Edward died. We know that Richard took control of the princes, that they were lodged with great comfort in the Tower, that he had them proclaimed illegitimate based on a prior morganatic marriage Edward had undertaken, and that there is no record of them having been seen during the last months of Richard's reign. We also know that Henry Tudor, a minor and ambitious offspring from the royal line, returned to England, raised an army and defeated Richard when the forces of Lord Stanley betrayed Richard and attacked his flank in the middle of the battle at Bosworth Field. Tudor took the crown, Richard's body disappeared after being abused, and the Tudor propaganda machine took over. Thanks primarily to Thomas More and, later, William Shakespeare, Richard was turned into a crook-backed, club-footed, amoral monster who slew innocent children, beheaded stalwart lovers of England, wooed widows over the caskets of their husbands and, to put it gently, was an unreliable friend. When Richard was killed in battle, the Tudors saw to it that Richard's reputation as a fair and capable king died with him. And that brings us to Tower of London. Here we have a cauldron of a movie bubbling merrily away that spatters as much rancid stew on Richard almost as vividly as Shakespeare and More did. Basil Rathbone plays Richard with enthusiastic malice. As a henchman, he has Boris Karloff as Mord, a big, club-footed, bald-headed, muscular torturer, eager to use the executioner's axe or the torturer's rack and whip. "You're more than a duke," Mord tells Richard, "more than a king. You're a god to me!" Mord eagerly and admiringly acts on Richard's plans, from thrusting a dagger into the back of the mad old Henry VI to tipping Clarence, Richard's troublesome brother, into a huge vat of malmsey, then sitting on the lid while waiting for the sound of the bubbles to stop. Just as with Shakespeare's Richard, Hollywood's Rathbonian version is great fun, at least as long as Richard has center stage. Things slow down when we spend time seeing how angelic the two royal tykes are. There also is a romantic and conventional subplot between a lady- in-waiting and a young man dedicated to helping Henry Tudor bring down Richard. This is Basil Rathbone's movie, however, and he makes the most of it with icy diction and some good lines. He hands his own dagger to Mord, then sends him to where Henry VI is praying. "A fitting occasion for a blade in the shape of a cross," Richard says. "It will insure the thrust and bless the wound." Karloff gives wonderful, dreadful support. At one point we watch him step heavily on a young royal messenger with his club foot. The boy doesn't survive. Of course, we should know the outcome by now. And who did kill the two young princes? Some say Richard would have been foolish to do so so soon into his reign. Better to wait if he were going to do the deed. The most likely candidate may be the Duke of Buckingham, amoral, unreliable and impetuous, who was eager to have Richard in his debt. My money is on Henry VII. If when Henry won the crown and then found the two princes in the Tower, both with a much better claim to the throne than Henry's, their future would quickly have become their past...as it did. Those who appreciate the gleeful assassination of a person's character will enjoy Lawrence Olivier's Richard III and Ian McKellan's Richard III. Those who might appreciate reading a different point of view should look up Paul Murray Kendall's marvelous biography, Richard III.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film with a limited audience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyway, what struck me first about this film was its presentation. It claims to be a horror film, but it doesn't share any of the characteristics of horror films from that period save Karloff's performance (which I'll discuss later). In the '30s and '40s US horror films were usually based around Gothic concepts and literature (hence Frankenstein, Dracula, and Zombies). "Tower of London, being a historical film, obviously cannot fit into this genre. Something that is missing is the expressionist influence that nearly all the horror films had in that era. Also, horror films usually have low key lighting present, and this one didn't. This is even truer in early horror because lighting had to fill the roles that makeup and special effects could not accomplish. This entire film employs high key lighting or neutral lighting. Not that this film is boring, but I wouldn't consider it a horror film.Now, what may give someone some way to consider this a horror film is Karloff's performance. Mord is a bald, hunchbacked executioner who shows no scruples as he murders various people. His feet are almost webbed as he moves. He also has the trademark unnatural loyalty to his master (Richard). I wish that the film had described their relationship further, but I suppose that a history textbook would do that just as well. Also, Rathbone's portrayal of Richard was worthy of a good horror film. He removes marionettes of those ahead of him (for the throne) as he kills them. He also has a devilish smile. Unfortunately, the other actor's (including Price) didn't act in accordance to the genre of film they were portraying. However, I wouldn't say they acted poorly.Where this film also shines is its effective use of blocking to overcome technological restraints. The battle scenes are very stylized, but given the censorship of the time, they work well. What I mean is that during the Battle of Bosworth sequence, hundreds of actors are visible and all of them are fencing with each other. I really hate thinking that "Birth of a Nation" is the progenitor of battle scenes like this one, but that's another story. So, how does "Tower of London" stand today? Well, I cannot give an honest opinion because I had no frame of reference. Here is what I think given the ability I now have. I would rate it as average due to the difficulty of the plot line (for most viewers). Also, Karloff fans will be disappointed that his role is much smaller than it usually is. Also, the film falsely proclaims to be a horror film when it isn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible History, from Universal studios</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tower of London is Universal's attempt to bring the classic Shakespeare play 'Richard III' to the silver screen. I can't say I'm a big fan of Shakespeare; but since this film puts a lot of focus on the dastardly nature of its lead character and numerous torture sequences; I have to say that I really enjoyed it. Rowland V. Lee's film attempts to tell the story of Richard III from his time as Duke of Gloucester, all the way to his reign of king - but since the film only runs for ninety minutes, it gets a little crammed; although that does mean things always stay interesting. The film takes place in the 15th century and we focus on Richard, duke of Gloucester and fourth in line to be king of England. He's not particularly happy about those people in front of him, and so sets out to eliminate them one by one; with the help of his trusty deformed assistant Mord. Richard slowly turns the tide in his favour as he gets the people on his side and plays various people above him to unwittingly fall into place.The film features a really good cast, headed up by Basil Rathbone. Rathbone is absolutely brilliant in the lead role and really capture the central character's slyness and lust for power. The actor would of course become most famous for playing Sherlock Holmes; but he really enjoys himself in this role also. Aside from Rathbone, the film also features two other great luminaries in smaller roles; Boris Karloff and Vincent Price. The plot has rather a lot to it and certain things are rushed; which means that the film can be a bit hard to get to grips with in the early stages, although it is saved by some truly great scenes; a pivotal one between Rathbone and Price is a particular highlight. Rowland V. Lee is keen to portray the horror of this story as much as possible and the film features a brilliant foreboding atmosphere and there are plenty of torture scenes (courtesy of Karloff's sadistic character) also. There are also a couple of battle scenes that highlight the film's weakness in terms of budget. The film would be remade in 1962 by Roger Corman; but the films are really very different and for my money, this is better of the pair. Overall, Tower of London works both as a historical drama and as a thriller and comes highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Moments That Aren't Woven Together Well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from superior performances by Basil Rathbone, Boris Karloff, and Vincent Price, there is little I found in this film to recommend.I believe the movie fails (as many films do) under the weight of a mediocre script and sub-par supporting cast. Even if one wasn't paying attention during their high school World History class, we already know within the first 15 minutes of the film what the entire story is, what will happen, and can make a common-sense-guess as to how the film will end. And, sure enough, there isn't a single surprise in the entire film. Wait, I take that back...the American accents were quite a surprise for me! Nan Grey is GORGEOUS...just as sexy dressed as a chimney sweep as she is dressed in fancy gown, but her American accent completely removes any sense of truth from the film. Barbara O'Neil at least tries a British accent periodically throughout the film...and even though she fails most of the time with it, at least she tries. The problem with O'Neil's performance is that it is so fake and over-the-top that it is impossible to take her seriously...especially with a couple of her stare-bug-eyed-directly-into-the-camera looks...utterly ridiculous! And I have no idea what anyone was thinking casting John Sutton as the hero of the piece...he was only slightly more masculine than the character Vincent Price was playing! I know Errol Flynn was too big a star at the time for the role, but he was exactly what this film needed to elevate it to where it needed to be...Basil Rathbone is such a powerful screen presence, he deserved a hero of equal stature.This movie is a must for Rathbone and Karloff fans, but there is little here for the rest. As good as Vincent Price was in this 1939 film as Clarence, his 1962 version of "Tower of London" has the horror legend giving a stellar, scenery-chewing performance as Richard that is among his greatest! Overall, a 4 out of 10 strictly out of respect for the lead performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TOWER OF London (Rowland V. Lee, 1939) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a horror film (which I was aware of beforehand, by the way, though I still included it in my Halloween schedule) - despite the studio involved and its featuring three of the genre's best stars.However, the great cast more than makes up for this: Basil Rathbone (though his hump isn't so prominent, he clearly dominates proceedings with his wily and malevolent Richard III - a sure sign of his versatility when taking into account that, during the same year, he also essayed the roles of Sherlock Holmes and Baron Frankenstein!), Boris Karloff (he's not on screen for very long but his imposing presence - accentuated by shaven head and clubfoot - is memorable indeed), Barbara O'Neill (as the distraught Queen - Rathbone has her two young sons, heirs to the throne of England, killed!), Ian Hunter (a jovial King Edward IV and an all-too-willing pawn in Richard's hand), Vincent Price (more than adequate as Clarence, whose role is bigger than I had anticipated though he later 'graduated' to playing Richard in Roger Corman's maligned 1962 version, but which I quite like - the scene leading to his demise at the hands of Rathbone and Karloff is one of the highlights of the film and it was such a pleasure to watch these three, who'd eventually re-unite years later for THE COMEDY OF TERRORS [1964], interact with one another!), Miles Mander (poignant as mad King Henry VI) and Rose Hobart (from the Fredric March version of DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE [1931], making a fine though brief and somewhat ambiguous Anne Neville - desired by Rathbone, who connives to make her his wife, she doesn't seem to mind him...even after having murdered her first husband!), to name just the principal players (for the supporting cast is peppered with familiar faces); John Sutton and Nan Grey (the memorable victim of a lesbian attack by the titular vampire in DRACULA'S DAUGHTER [1936] and who would soon be promoted to the female lead alongside Vincent Price himself in THE INVISIBLE MAN RETURNS [1940]) provide the requisite romantic interest.Boasting a handsome production (courtesy of cinematographer George Robinson and production designer Jack Otterson - with the "Iron Maiden" likely a leftover prop from THE MAN WHO LAUGHS {1928; which I've just rewatched}), the plot-heavy film may come across as stagy and talky for horror-film fanatics - and quite complicated for someone not well versed in English history!; as for myself, it was never less than absorbing, but I'm lucky in having watched the remake twice already - not to mention Laurence Olivier's stylized cinematic adaptation of Shakespeare's play on the subject, RICHARD III (1955; whose Criterion 2-DVD Set I've yet to check out, incidentally), a number of times... Unfortunately, however, Rathbone's come-uppance during the Battle at Bosworth Field (footage of which found its way into the cheaply-made remake!) feels somewhat rushed - whereas Karloff gets a great exit!! Besides, the music by Frank Skinner re-uses themes from his score for SON OF FRANKENSTEIN (1939; with which it also shares Rathbone, Karloff and director Lee)! In the end, not among the great Universal films perhaps, but an interesting change-of-pace nonetheless - and easily the best title in "The Boris Karloff Collection".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhere between a period drama and a cheesy hammer horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The exterior scenes of London are convincing and the claustrophobic, incestuous halls of the tower seem an ideal setting for a drama about greed, betrayal and murder. The horror aspect is somewhat over played by Universal's marketing. It seems unlikely that any audience, even those in the 30's, would not have been more thrilled than horrified by the medieval power struggles depicted in the film.The scenery and lighting enhance a dark and ominous tone that reinforces the typical atmosphere of a horror genre film. So too does the presence of Boris Karloff, playing a sadistic club-footed executioner named Mord. This Igor-like caricature is hardly scary, and even adds a humorous element when viewed by modern audiences. Basil Rathbone plays the truly ruthless Duke of Gloucester, as both villain and protagonist. The plot revolves around his desire to usurp his brother's throne, killing those who stand in his way. Vincent Price also makes an appearance, a weak portrayal of the Duke's alcoholic half-brother, Clarence, who is dispatched by being drowned in wine. Oh the irony! Rathbone's intense stare and slimy charm as the Duke make for a compelling depiction, although somewhat overacted. His intensity is complimented by the comic relief provided by Ian Hunter as Edward IV. The film has been compared to Shakespeare's Richard III, but to compare this disposable pseudo-history to the work of the Bard is both unfair and pointless. This film is certainly historical and also theatrical, but it is not a history lesson nor is it truly Shakespearean. The film is as raunchy and violent as was allowed in the 30's, which by today's standards means hardly at all. The performances carry the somewhat tedious plot along, combined with the intrigue provided by its historical significance and the striking cinematography.The demonification of historical figures as depicted in The Tower of London may not correspond with the facts, but can be very entertaining. If a certain auteur has not applied fantasy to history, there would be no Count Dracula as we know him. This film is ideal for anyone with an interest in the War of the Roses, the mysteries of the Tower of London or the camp and theatrical horror of the black and white era. Those seeking an alternative depiction of Shakespeare's Richard III should keep looking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tower of London-Dark Ending Battle Scenes Spoils It's All Killing in the Family **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basil Rathobone has a field day as the Duke of Gloucester. This madman, with his hidden figurines of the family he wants to kill one by one, is absolutely diabolically brilliant in his performance. The part was tailor made for him and once again proved that he was the master of evil. Equally impressive here is the work done by Boris Karloff, as the horrific Mord, the latter carrying out Gloucester's evil deeds.Vincent Price and Ian Hunter play Gloucester's brother, the latter, the king who was duped by Rathbone in his systematic elimination of the family.Price goes from being feeble minded to devilish in his role but like the others, he is a victim of his brother's insane goal.1939 was certainly an important year for Barbara O'Neil. She plays her role well as Hunter's wife, a victimized queen. She realizes what is going on but is literally powerless to do anything to save her own 2 sons from the wrath of their uncle. In that same year, she briefly but strongly appeared in "Gone With the Wind," as Ellen O'Hara, mother to Katie Scarlett.To me, the film is spoiled at the end by the dark battle scenes that were filmed. Both Rathbone and Karloff get what they deserve, but it occurs too quickly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Middling Historical B-flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is now being offered as part of a 5-film set entitled "The Boris Karloff Collection," although Karloff has little screen time and only a handful of lines.What's worth watching here are fine performances by a young Basil Rathbone and a very young Vincent Price, in his third film role. When Rathbone and Price are on screen, there's enough energy to hold your interest, but when the action switches to the rather dopey romantic lead, the picture starts to drag. Although a lot of effort went into historical detail with a limited budget, it's not exactly compelling viewing.This is fairly close to the historical story of Richard III, although the Caliban-esquire character played by Karloff, as Richard's evil henchman, is probably fictitious. It's worth comparing to the later film of the same name, starring Vincent Price as Richard, which introduces a supernatural element and has less to do with historical events. Neither film is top drawer, but at least the later film is shorter.</fullReview>

Basil Rathbone(deliciously mad)is perfectly cast as Richard III while Boris Karloff portrays his evil executioner and loyal henchman Mort.Stylish, but melodramatic. Does have good tense moments as heroic John Wyatt(John Sutton)will work behind-the-scenes the try and take Richard III down(..though at one time is captured and subsequently tortured by Richard and Mort for he has lead a successful operation in stealing the king's treasure).Some battle sequences and a wonderful supporting performance from Vincent Price as the wimpy Duke of Clarence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite having been released on video as part of the "Universal Pictures Monster Collection," it's actually an historical drama that looks fairly elaborate considering it's rumored low-budget. It is certainly well-acted especially by Basil Rathbone and, in his film debut, Vincent Price (who would star in a 1962 remake). Nevertheless, even with a bald, ax-wielding Boris Karloff in tow, this is a tedious affair, and I suppose it always was, even in the early 70s when I had seen and liked it in the wee hours on my local TV station's "Late Night Movie." It impressed me for some reason back then, but I don't know why. I still don't. It's certainly a big letdown from "Son of Frankenstein" which the same director (Rowland V. Lee) made earlier in the year for the same studio, with the same two stars (Rathbone and Karloff).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazingly ordinary and uninvolving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was extremely surprised how ordinary and dull this film was considering it starred Basil Rathbone and Boris Karloff (who had both just starred in a Frankenstein movie together). While I wasn't sure if it was going to be a horror film (it really wasn't), I sure expected a lot more from it than it delivered. Instead of excitement, it offered a muddled and uninvolving history lesson about Richard III as well as the rest of the late of the Plantagenet rulers. While the film fortunately doesn't look too much like Shakespeare's RICHARD III (his version of British history makes historians cringe), it is still very much influenced by it (such as the whole idea of Richard being a hunchbacked and evil man who killed off Edward V and his younger brother). The actual truth is quite muddled and confusing--to this day no one is sure if it was Richard or even Henry VII or someone else who was behind the children's disappearance.So apart from the historical aspects of the film, how is the overall product? Well, the battle scenes are amazingly dull and the story itself is at times interesting and at other times like a snooze-fest. In fact, aside from the few scenes with Karloff (he wasn't in the movie nearly enough to suit me---he really brightened up the film) and the drowning of Vincent Price (a great scene), the film just seems to drag. This is a case of generally good actors but dull dialog and direction. The only exception to this was Barbara O'Neil, as Queen Elizabeth. She was amazingly poor in the film, as there were several times when she just stared into the camera or made facial expressions that just didn't suit the events taking place (such as deaths of her husband or other family members).So if you want to watch a dull historical piece interrupted occasionally by cool scenes involving Karloff as Richard's henchman and chief torturer, then this film is for you. Otherwise, this is a very forgettable film and probably not worth your time.PS--Despite the video art on IMDb, the film did not star Karloff and he was not exactly a major figure in the film.</fullReview>
