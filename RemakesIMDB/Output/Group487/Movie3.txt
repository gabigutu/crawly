		<shortDescription>How do YOU describe "great?" I define it with this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My God, the reviewer before me MUST be mad!!! Either that, or he/she must be struggling with their own sexuality! THIS is one of my favorite movies of ALL time. Julie Andrews is in fine musical form; James Garner gives one of his greatest comedic performances since "The Americanization of Emily" (also with Julie Andrews) and Lesley Ann Warren just about steals the picture! This movie scores a solid "10" for comedy, a sterling "10" for music and a rousing "10" for romance! ANYONE that DOESN'T like this movie should suck an egg! HOW did Lesley Ann Warren NOT win an Oscar? Ditto, Robert Preston? I consider myself a guy's guy, but I confess I tear up every time I hear the opening refrains of Julie singing "Crazy World," the film's theme song. Bravo, Blake Edwards!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The last great musical?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Victor/Victoria" was the film where Blake Edwards finally managed to deliver his valentine to his wife, Julie Andrews, and convince the public to join in. Maybe because of that, it's one of his most heartfelt movies, and the enormous love between the director and his star do as much to warm up this movie as the careful colour composition of Dick Bush's fantastic - and underrated - photography.This is a film where everything works perfectly. The acting ranges from the impeccable (the leads) through the touching (Alex Karras) right to the truly sublime (Robert Preston and Lesley Ann-Warren). The musical numbers are lovingly staged and shot and, possibly because this is a pre-MTV film, we actually get to see dancers dancing, as opposed to machine-gun assemblies of body parts performing details of not necessarily connected movements. The directorial touch is assured, proficient but never showy: the many complicated set-ups are executed with elegance, economy - not a frivolous camera movement to be seen - and discretion. (The circular pan around Julie as she sings "Crazy World" is a lovely example of how camera movement can create emotion without drawing attention to itself.) The sets and costumes are lavish but, again, do not distract. The screenplay is witty, full of deft touches, and Edwards treats his rather daring (for 1982) theme without blinking, and with great lucidity. (The other drag film of the year was "Tootsie", which stuck to the romance and stayed away from uncomfortable homosexual touches as much as it managed to.) The timing never falters. And the score is priceless.All in all, a flawless entertainment, which, like the best movies from the studio system's heyday of which "Victor / Victoria" is a proud and worthy descendant, rewards the attentive (and interested) viewer with far more substance - and style - than might appear at first. I do not have the space to analyse this film at the length it deserves; but I can recommend it, which I do wholeheartedly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Le Film Hot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dazzling art direction, lavish costumes, funny dialogue, a fabulous soundtrack, and Robert Preston make "Victor/Victoria" one of filmdom's most entertaining musicals of all time. Set in 1934 Paris, and filmed in luscious color, the film tells the story of two down and out friends who carry out an ingenious plan to get rich. Toddy (Robert Preston), a gay performer, persuades Victoria (Julie Andrews), a struggling singer, to change her appearance to that of a man so that she can pose on stage as a female impersonator. Blake Edwards converts the film's clever concept into a film of true cinematic flair and panache.The film's music alone is enough to make "Victor/Victoria" a winner. With consummate verve, Andrews sings the lively "Le Jazz Hot", a stage performance that has been mimicked by, it seems, one in ten talent competitors in the Miss America Pageant for the last twenty years. The colorful song "The Shady Dame From Seville" is memorable as a cultural classic. Even the restrained "You And Me" is satisfying, with its old fashioned charm. And Henry Mancini's wistful and slightly melancholy original score adds melodic balance to the flashy stage numbers.The casting is perfect. I cannot imagine anyone other than Julie Andrews as Victoria. James Garner is fine as King Marchand. And in support roles, Lesley Ann Warren adds sexy spunk as Norma, and Alex Karras is surprisingly effective as Marchand's bodyguard. But it is music man Robert Preston who leads this top notch Hollywood talent parade. Preston is likable throughout, and is a hoot in the film's finale.If the film has a flaw, it might be in the editing. The plot in Act Two slows down. Or, to say it a little differently, it ... drags (so to speak). The 132 minute runtime is a tad long maybe, and so a few scene deletions here and there might have rendered a slight improvement in the pace. But, this is a minor issue, one that I raise only in my grasping-at-straws attempt to find something to complain about."Victor/Victoria" is an expressive, fun, one-of-a-kind musical garden party that easily makes my list of top fifty films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great 1962 Movie -- Made in 1982</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite all of its gender-bending commentary on sexuality, both hetero- and homo-, "Victor/Victoria" looked and sounded in 1982 (year of "ET" and "The Road Warrior") as if it were made in 1962 -- and that was a good thing. Blake Edwards' trademark ability to combine lush romanticism with immitable slapstick comedy was here matched by a wonderful score by his longtime collaborator Henry Mancini, "Voila!" -- we're back in the early sixties again. (It didn't hurt that stars Julie Andrews and James Garner were hottest in the sixties, and had acted together in 1964's "The Americanization of Emily.")Robert Preston, "The Music Man" of late fifties Broadway and 1962 screen fame, further added an element of early sixties nostalgia -- with the twist that he here used his booming vocal tones in the service of a delightfully out and comfortable gay man. Preston was one of two hot contenders for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar that year. The winner was Lou Gossett, Jr. for his Drill Instructor in "An Officer And A Gentleman."Rounding out the great cast are Lesley Ann Warren (sexy and very funny) in an Oscar-nominated role as Garner's mob moll floozie, and Alex Karras, continually funny as Garner's softhearted ox of a bodyguard. (Karras gets a classic Blake Edwards slapstick routine trapped in the freezing snow outside a Paris hotel, getting big laughs out of the simple line: "You've got heat? That's good.")And be sure to keep a lookout for "Sherloque Tanney" as the French private detective on Victor/Victoria's trail. Tanney was Blake Edwards dentist, and appeared in almost every Blake Edwards film from "Darling Lili" (1970) on. Other than his corpse in "SOB," (1981), the French detective is possibly Dr. Tanney's greatest role on the screen. Tanney, too, gets to anchor several great trademark Blake Edwards slapstick routines.Oh, and there's music, too. Enough music for a Broadway musical (which is what "Victor/Victoria" became), and with a sad and wistful Mancini title tune (reprised in the film by Andrews) that reminds one a bit of "Moon River" and "Days of Wine and Roses." Just like in the early sixties.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine way for the stars to break away from their earlier roles, and it's pretty funny, too.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three of the stars of this movie all made their mark playing wholesome characters, (and all in musicals, ironically) but they certainly got rid of those personas in this film. Julie Andrews finally solved the problem of Maria by playing a woman pretending to be a man pretending to be a woman, Robert Preston's gay entertainer is a long, long way from Harold Hill, and Lesley Ann Warren... well, her floozy moll ("Ya mean you really aw... quee-uh?") basically erases all memories of Cinderella. All give excellent performances in this entertaining, funny film from director/co-writer Blake Edwards. And they all get to sing some great songs from Henry Mancini and Leslie Brucusse, among them "Le Jazz Hot," (in which Andrews sings in her lower range, and actually sizzles) "The Shady Dame From Seville," (first sung by Andrews, then hilariously reprised at the end by Preston) and "Chicago, Illinois." (Warren is great in that) Though there is a long stretch in the middle that either included jokes and/or subtleties that went over my head or just wasn't funny, though not bad, otherwise it's a great comedy. In addition to the three performers mentioned, James Garner is also good as the gangster who falls for Andrews but is unsure of her gender.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly enjoyable transgender comedy with Andrews and Preston at their best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paris in the '30s is the setting for this screwball sex comedy wherein JULIE ANDREWS, for the sake of being employed, takes a job as a woman pretending to be a man pretending to be a woman--figure that one out. Then we have a great moment when ROBERT PRESTON does an imitation of Julie singing "The Shady Dame from Seville" in drag--yes drag--the actor who played such sturdy romantic leads in the '40s and '50s is hilarious as a gay blade who hooks up with Julie during a restaurant scene in which she plants a cockroach in her plate to avoid paying for dinner.That's the kind of romp this is. And it's extremely witty, with JAMES GARNER as Julie's romantic interest who hasn't figured out why he's so attracted to "the shady dame" when she's supposed to be a man.First-rate sets and cinematography in color, and while none of it really makes any sense, the song and dance routines are fabulous with some great tunes by Henry Mancini. LESLEY ANN WARREN gives a priceless performance as a bird brained vamp in her Oscar nominated supporting role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let me just say that I am slightly obsessed with Julie Andrews and her work. With that out of the way... I love her in this movie because it's not your typical Julie Andrews movie. Most people see her in The Sound of Music or Mary Poppins or (if you know this far back in her career) Cinderella. However, she delivers a flawless performance as Victor/Victoria. The only skepticism I have about this movie is seeing her as a man. She's so feminine (in her mannerisms, voice, appearance, etc.) that it's almost impossible to think that she's a man. Robert Preston is wonderfully funny, and I always love James Garner. The movie probably could have done without Lesley Ann Warren's song and dance number (why ruin Julie and Robert's wonderful score?)... On a side note, Warren's character reminded me a bit of Jean Hagen's Lina Lamont in Singin' in the Rain; they each had their characters down perfectly, and you got just annoyed with them enough to hate them but like them at the same time...Of course, Andrews does a beautiful job with all the songs- my favorite being her first jazz number. All in all, an impossibly wonderful performance by all involved.DEFINITELY ten out of ten!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" A woman, pretending to be a man, pretending to be a woman "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many social innovations, have often as not originated in France. Take cross-dressing for instance. In the 1930's a singer created quite a sensation when her fabulous show became the toast of Paris. She traveled throughout Europe and remained a novelty for years. Her success was due to the fact that she was not a woman after all. She was a man. This fact became the inspiration for the film "Victoria/Victoria." In the movie, a talented female singer (Julie Andrews) named Victoria Grant (aka Count Victor Grezhinski) schemes with an out of work cabaret singer, Carroll 'Toddy' Todd (Robert Preston, who is fantastic in this role) to create a female impersonation act. With the help of Andre Cassell, (John Rhys Davies) a night club owner they hope to get rich with the unusual act. Complications arise however, the least of which is a visiting gangster named King Marchand (James Garner) who takes a liking for Victoria. His Chicago girlfriend Norma Cassady (Lesley Ann Warren) become jealous and informs other hoodlums to come to Paris. Alex Karras, plays Mr. Bernstein, Garners' bodyguard). The film is a solid hit for the cast and lays the foundation of it become a classic. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A relief from most of today's movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great wit, wonderful set design, very good acting - What can one say bad about the film? Perhaps the plethora of homosexuals was a bit over the top, as was the part of the private investigator, but these are nit-picks hardly noticed against the background of most modern releases. While I dislike musicals intensely, this one is different, most obviously in the setting for the music. Unlike the incongruous breaking out in song in the middle of conversation, this movie's music occurs within the framework of nightclub acts. This adds to the credibility of a plot that could have spun out of control, much as S.O.B. did (unfortunately). What really sets this movie apart from the crowd of box-office hits that plague us is the incredible wit of the dialogue. The writing is truly wonderful! And Preston is perfect for his character, his repartee style as sharp as the lines Blake Edwards puts in his mouth. It is my tendency to pick apart films on the issue of credibility, allowing as we should for the genre of the film. H.G.Wells once said that good science fiction depended on introducing one and only one fantastic idea, and then developing a plot whose events would follow reasonably from that one idea. Bad science fiction, he said, introduces several such incredible inventions and ideas, creating a plot too fantastic for the reader to immerse him/herself in. So too with movies. Good comedy, science fiction, drama, even action plots, should have one premise that might stretch the limit of credibility, and then develop the plot reasonably from there. Most modern box-office hits fail to do this, and in the process of feeding us one fantasy after another to stimulate our interest and attract our dollars, dulls our minds. Victor / Victoria is good writing because it starts with its one major premise - an unsuccessful, though talented singer achieving fame and fortune by altering her sexual image - and lets the plot play itself out. There are a few minor stretches beside the main premise, but without fantastic physical feats, explosions, car chases, and CG effects, Edwards has created a script that pulls - rather than pushes - you in to the plot. The weakest part of the plot is the fact that Andrew's character attains success not just by cross-dressing, but also by substantially altering her act. We are supposed to ignore the fact that she has changed from simply singing to singing with well choreographed movement. However, this is not a serious flaw, because in the real Hollywood (and Broadway), very good talent is habitually unsuccessful, while the fantastic and ridiculous is placed on an altar. (Does anyone really think Schwarzenegger can act?) Did I say acting? Perhaps I saved the best for last. Andrews playing herself is perfect here, Garner is fantastic, and Leslie Ann Warren adapted to her character's personality so completely that I hardly realized it was her. And, at the risk of repetition, Preston is perfection itself. The set design was almost excessive in the distraction it caused, for you could not help noticing how artfully it was designed and lit. Finally, Henry Mancini wrote the music. The DVD commentary added substantially to the production, making the entire package a 5-star offering, a rating I rarely give.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey! I have a great idea -- let's put on a farce!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written and directed by Blake Edwards, this is a fast, witty farce about a woman posing as a man posing as a woman in 1930s Paris. Victoria (Julie Andrews) is down on her luck. Oh, not as bad as George Orwell in "Down and Out in Paris and London," but pretty far down, this being the depression. She develops a scheme to cheat her way through a full meal at a restaurant by planting a cockroach in her salad. It more or less works but, more important, she runs into cheerful, savvy, gay Robert Preston who becomes her manager.Andrews has been unable to find work as a soprano because singers are a glut on the market, but Preston promotes her as a female impersonator. She succeeds wildly. Among the audience at one of her shows in a fancy nightclub is rich James Garner, his coarse moll, Leslie Anne Warren, and his big, beefy bodyguard, Alex Karras.Garner is sexually aroused by Andrews' sultry performance and when she whips off her headgear and reveals herself as a man named Victor, Garner's face falls marvelously. He's been excited by a MAN! When he gets back to his room he needs to prove his manhood by virtually attacking Warren. Alas, his homosexual anxiety renders him impotent, but Warren is all understanding. "Awww, honey, it's no big deal. Women are lucky. They can fake it. Oh, not with YOU, baby! Listen, just 'cause you can't get it -- Up till now it's been wonderful." After that, it gets complicated.The writing is sharply witty. In the restaurant, at the very beginning, when Andrews and Preston meet, there is a hilarious exchange between Preston and the waiter, played by Graham Stark as one of those contemptuous French waiters who always seems distracted, as if mentally deconstructing La Pensee Sauvage, you know, and you're interrupting his cogitation. But Preston, being gay, is his equal. Stark pours a glass of white wine for Preston, who squints at it with distaste and remarks, "The last time I saw something like this they had to shoot the horse." Preston is trying to dress Andrews as a man and teach her to act in a masculine fashion. He tells her thoughtfully, "There are two main obstacles we must overcome." Andrews asks, "My bosom?", and then adds that if she has to bind her bosom for years it will wind up looking like an old wallet. After Andrews' success, Preston checks them into a three-star hotel and announces, "You must see the bathroom. It's a religious experience." Much of the humor revolves around gender bending, of course, but the script treats the audience as reasonably sophisticated rather than 19th-century rural twits. I don't think Blake Edwards depends on shock value for laughs. The laughs arise out of the situations.There are a couple of songs thrown in. Julie Andrews has a splendid voice, and a range that runs from elephantine sub-rumble to air raid siren. The dance numbers are elaborately staged, with what I take to be a deliberate homage to Bob Fosse -- plenty of derbies, clicking fingers, and swiveling pelvises.There's a mostly dull romantic piece in the mosaic, done seriously, in which Andrews and Garner try to come to terms with the fact that they love each other, although if they want to keep her real sex a secret, they must go dancing at a gay bar. And some of the comic interludes seems a little forced, at least on multiple viewings. Andrews, in her masculine disguise, bravely accepts a cigar -- and coughs. She looks immeasurably better as a woman than as a man. And the final number, in which Preston is in drag and singing one of Andrews' numbers and falling all over himself, isn't really either imaginative or very amusing.But those are small things. Overall, this is a funny farce, skillfully written, directed, and performed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Victor/Victoria does drag.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Victor/Victoria is a reasonably entertaining film that unfortunately lacks pacing and originality, and preaches to the audience. The cast all have their moments with Warren and Preston being standouts. And like Blake Edwards' The Great Race (1965) it relies too heavily on over-extended slapstick with everything in sight being smashed which becomes tiresome and repetitive. The sets remain sets, and all of the actors except for Andrews are and remain American. Europe in the 30s is not convincingly evoked. The film is too talky and does come off as homosexual propaganda with Andrews lecturing James Garner as well as the audience. Overall, the film feels more like a comedy from the early 60s which was the most prolific period for Edwards, Andrews and Garner. The musical numbers are fine and there is fun to be had, but it's somewhat overrated, overlong and rather forgettable. The film became a Broadway musical directed by Edwards and starring Andrews and it worked better on stage than it does on film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1982 was a gender-bending year for Hollywood. Dustin Hoffman dressed up as a woman; Julie Andrews dressed up as a man. How fitting that the very next year Linda Hunt would win the first Oscar ever given for playing a member of the opposite sex."Victor Victoria" is a solidly-crafted, old-fashioned musical that finds Andrews pretending to be a male female impersonator (got that?) so that she can hold a job in a nightclub in Depression-era Paris. James Garner is the man's man who begins to doubt his manliness when he finds himself having some strange feelings for this "guy." It's a very gay-friendly movie that's really squeaky clean, though it might have been racy at the time when homosexuality wasn't as accepted as it is now (if you want to call it "accepted" even now).There are lots of production numbers, but this doesn't feel like a musical, as all of the numbers are presented in context of a show and they don't propel the plot or develop characters. Lesley Ann Warren is fairly obnoxious as a bawdy American, but Robert Preston steals the show as a fellow drag performer.As far as Blake Edwards projects go, this is one of the strongest.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always had a struggle with VICTOR VICTORIA and only recently saw the 1935 Brit original FIRST A BOY with Jesse Matthews which itself was a remake of the identical German version called VIKTOR VIKTORIA from 1933. It is the German version that now in 2011 might just be the most fascinating of the two originals... however 30 years on from 1982, I possibly can appreciate VICTOR VICTORIA for the hilarious MGM musical farce others claim it is and see it up there with SINGIN IN THE RAIN and MY FAVOURITE YEAR. What I dislike about VV is that it is too long and too ramshackle in plot. Also I just get tired of it. Yes sacrilege I know but if it was tighter and not as meandering (it is half an hour longer than SINGIN IN THE RAIN and most other glorious musicals equally applauded) I would find it a better film. the ending just runs on and on with Robert Preston doing his lady Of Seville number. Every component of VV is terrific, Julie Andrews is as gorgeous as she was in STAR! (which I love yes even at 3 hours) and the sets and costumes are terrific. There is a lot of Pink Panther gag humor from director Blake Edwards and a perfect supporting cast. Robert Preston has had an incredible career and I equally admire him in MAME as in MUSIC MAN and here ... three massive musicals hits in the 60s 70s and 80s... almost a match for Julie! I love the parts of VV but I just don't love the film as a whole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Julie/Blake---great team!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Julie Andrews stars in this hilarious movie directed by not surprisingly BLake Edwards who is known for producing movies as such. Julie Andrews and Blake Edwards have been married since 1969, and Blake definately knows how to use his wife's talents (see "Darling Lili", "The Tamerind Seed" and others). Julie plays Victoria Grant, a down on her luck soprano opera singer who is in London in search of a singing job. Set in the 1934, Opera isn't really "in", so when Victoria comes in to audition for a night club owner he rejects her. Victoria sings "Cherry Ripe" and impresses everyone else in the club but the Misour LabIsse with her incredible high notes. He insists that she's better of somewhere else and that some practice may do her some good (in becoming less operetic). She tartly replys "Despite what you think, Misour LaBisse, there are some proffession where practices does make perfect!" and then she belt out on amazing high note, which brakes glass and shocks Mr. LaBisse to the very core. One of the people who watched Victoria audition was Toddy (Carroll Todd), a gay employee of Mr. LaBisse. He is very impressed. Victoria and Toddy later meet by chance at a restuarant that Victoria plans to throw a cockroach in her meal to get out of paying. They immediatly hit it off and become good friends. Toddy gets this "brilliant" idea...and well Count Victor Grazinski is born. This movie is WONDERFUL! In 1995 it was made into a very successful Broadway show, again starring Andrews. James Garner, Robert Preston and Lesley Ann Warren give spectacular performances. And need I even talk about Ms Andrews? Needless to say she was the best part of the whole movie! As I have said before, Mr. Edwards sure knows how to use his wife talents. And you tell he really loves his wife- who can blame him?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprising - and in a GOOD way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Blake Edwards directing and the general idea being a story about a woman playing a female impersonator, the project SHOULD have been a failure. But at every turn, the actors take a so-so script and somehow make the gags work. Robert Preston uses his considerable genius to build a character around lines others would have blown or wouldn't have understood. Other actors (like Andrews) stay in character during situations in which you might expect them to burst into laughter or drop their jaws in disbelief. They must have been having the utter time of their lives while making this film. It's good practice for those in the drama professions to watch this film for instruction on how to keep a straight face, no matter what.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People of this generation might not appreciate the fact that in 1982, the subject matter of this mainstream movie was fairly "adult"! In other words, mainstream movies featuring gay characters and gay lifestyles just weren't being made. So, the tolerance that the straight main characters show the gay characters seems "normal" now but wasn't the case back in the early 80s in American culture... (and honestly, I'm not sure gay characters lived so openly with one another as depicted in 1930s Paris...) This is one of those movies where the trailer is spectacular and really makes the movie look more brilliant than it is. In reality, it's a typically bloated Blake Edwards production which is about a half hour longer than it needs to be. The premise is delicious and easy to grasp, so why does it take... an HOUR for the romantic complication, King Marchand, to show up? And was it really necessary to spend so much time on the not-so-hidden double life that Victoria and King lead together once they finally become a couple? (for example, it was not necessary to spend several minutes of screen time on King picking a fight in a bar because he was feeling not so masculine) Robert Preston's performance in this movie is legendary and I have to agree he was dreadfully robbed at Oscar time. However, this is probably an unpopular opinion but I felt Lesley Anne Warren's performance was really quite overrated and grating (not in a good way).The screenplay makes some choices at the expense of others - for instance, having King discover fairly early on that Victoria is in fact a woman. (In truth... James Garner related in his memoir that he wanted King to NOT know if Victoria was female before kissing her, but the studio felt that no one would ever believe that manly James Garner could ever play a character potentially attracted to a man.) However, it's worth the early reveal, for the scene where King is breathlessly waiting to see if his hunch is true by watching Victoria get ready for her bath.A great premise that unfortunately didn't really perfectly "gel" as a story... but what the hell, it is a fun and delightful movie (loved Alex Karras the best!) Robert Preston's final number in drag is the the most fun scene I have watched in a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>at first sigh - a musical from golden age of Hollywood. only the theme can be strange. in fact, a lovely film in which Julie Andrews shines.it is funny and dramatic, sweet and political correct, charming and kitsch in few moments. but, more important, it has the art to seduce because the Paris from 1934, the atmosphere of 1960, on screen in 1982 are tricks who gives to it the aura of evergreen. it can be another Cabaret or a not common comedy. but the doses are precises and the team at high level. so, it is not just a musical or a nice movie, it is not a manifesto in AIDS shadow or a lesson about moral. it represents only a story of love, an old exploration of dream power, arena for good acting and for a lovely music. and it is enough to remember it, again and again like a slice of eccentric joy spirit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>May I Review the First Half?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I think of the word "uneven" this film comes to mind. The first half is a wonderful funny film about the rise of a starving artist in the right place at the correct time. And the performances, wow! Julie Andrews vocal and comedic talents put to use, Leslie Ann Warren in an amazing performance as the ultimate Depression-era floozie and Robert Preston in what is probably his best film performance after The Music Man. All this flows perfectly for about an hour and then the second half, how shall I put this, stinks. I have frequently commented Hollywood would benefit from learning to make shorter, better films--a concept I wish Blake Edwards had considered when putting this film together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I like this movie more every time I watch it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw it, I thought it was "pretty good." Amusing, but I didn't expect to find myself watching it again.It's unpretentious. It doesn't have Big Ideas or profound themes that you have to watch it twice to get.But it's got lovable characters and a kickin' plot, and I happen to have a huge crush on the 1930s. I love the friendship between Victoria and Toddy because it feels so genuine and it's rare to see a friendship (particularly between men and women) portrayed so well in movies. I love the romance between Victoria and King, because they're well-matched, but at the same time the problems in their relationship are so realistic. Fundamental inability to compromise? I think everyone knows what that's like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Julie Andrews is the Man!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blake's 'Victor/Victoria' is a splendid musical comedy set in Paris during the late 1930s. Julie Andrews stars in the title role delivering one of her finest performances (cannot imagine anyone else play the part), along with James Garner (brilliant), Robert Preston (superb), Lesley Ann-Warren (hilarious) and Alex Karras (funny). All actors share a wonderful chemistry. Blake's colourful and heartfelt accomplishment is a result of the effort put together by cast, crew and director. The musical numbers have been beautifully picturised without deviating from the witty screenplay. The dialogs are cleverly written and certainly more than add to the charm. The costumes and set designs, though loud and lavish, do not distract nor deviate from the main content and they look genuine. Blake also creates a strangely dark but humorous atmosphere of Paris where only the rich survive and there is no place for the poor.'Victor/Victoria' does explore issues of homosexual lifestyles that clash with heterosexual lifestyle but never does it lose its touch with humour. After all, this is a comedy and one of the finest. It doesn't try to be bigger than what it is. There are several hilariously memorable moments. A few examples are: when Garner and Karras sneak into Andrew's and Preston's suite. Andrew's song and dance numbers, Garner doubting his own sexuality, Karras coming to terms with his identity, Warren's scenes with Garner and Andrews, when Preston and Andrews have dinner at the restaurant for the first time and Andrews pretending to be a man.The film though exceeds the traditional 2 hour length, it's time well spent as you'll find yourself amused by this witty and cleverly made heartfelt piece of entertainment. It's one of my favourite comedies and I think you're gonna love it too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Victor/Victoria was released in 1982. Believe it or not this was a watershed year in Hollywood History. This was 1982 before AIDS became an household word! Hollywood that year released many gay theme movies.The biggest risk was "Making Love". That was the most controversial one released! Another three movies that were released that year were "Personel Best", &amp; "Partners" &amp; of course Victor/Victoria. However when all of them were box office disappointment's and the next year AIDS made the nightly news. So Hollywood studios turned its back on gay theme movies.However Victor/Victoria made headlines for weeks for lots of reasons! However this was still a box office disappointment but still one the best reviewed movies of that year! ( It would be a shoo in for Best Picture if it were made today) Now get this Hollywood released 3 movies that year that have become "Classics". The 3 movies were "E.T.", "Tootsie" and "Victor/Victoria". Sadly what won the Academy Award for Best Picture was "Ghandi". (I could of lived with "ET") However "Victor/Victoria" was nominated for Best Picture! However as the years have gone by I am sure that more people have gotten satisfaction out of this movie than Ghandi! This motion picture is just as funny today as it was in 1982.In this movie a down on her luck singer ends up at the home of gay man because she is broke and homeless! One thing leads to another and he turns into a female impersonator! So she is a woman pretending to be a man pretending to be a woman. The gay characters in this are fun and drive the story! This was Blake Edwards crowning achievement. In fact he later turned this movie into a Broadway play! The movie was Nominated for Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor". 2 songs from this move are standouts. In fact "Le Jazz Hot" is now in most Vegas Lounge acts. Rent the DVD!! See the widescreen edition! It is great entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>classic love story.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, well, its not really a classic love story, but its your classic boy meets girl pretending to be a boy pretending to be a girl story, and probably the best one of those thats ever been made. Julie Andrews plays Victoria(and Victor) quite well, but sometimes its hard believing that people would believe that she is a man. There are some great scenes in this movie that are derived from this concept though. James Garner and Robert Preston are both excellent in their roles, Preston as Andrews gay friend, and Garner, the manliest man around. Actually, all of the performances are excellent, but a lot of this movies success has to go to Blake Edwards. There is classic Edwards comedy in this movie, and a very intelligent script that never insults its audiences intelligence. I won't give specifics, but I will say the there is a show stopping number at the end of the movie that is hilarious. Most of the music is excellent, and if its bad, its intended to be that way. Really though, I only have one question. Having seen "The Party", and now this movie, one has to wonder, what does Blake Edwards have against waiters? 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

Leslie Anne Warren was deservedly nominated for an Academy Award. Only two quibbles: first, it's a shame Blake Edwards chickened out and put in the scene in the hotel bathroom. Second, no matter what the IMDB trivia for this movie tells you, the opera attended by King and Victoria is Madama Butterfly, which IS NOT about a man masquerading as a woman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's the he/she gender bender. Of course a down and out Victoria Grant as the singer. She meets up with Toddy and together they put on an act that introduces "Count Victor". All goes well until "King" wonders why he is falling for a "man". His moll Norma thinks it is quite funny until she tells King's partner in his nightclub business. King's bodyguard (Karras)is also coming out of the closet and ends up with Toddy. Victoria believes that she is tired of hiding in the shadows and wants to be Mrs. King Marchand. She has to convince Norma that she is not a man. And then one final act before she retires. Her friend Toddy decides to take matters in his own hands and replaces Victoria. It is precious to see Robert Preston as a female impersonator. The role is tailor made for Julie Andrews and it gives her depth as an actress. She can play other roles not just as a nanny and a nun!</fullReview>

She has no money and he has just been fired from the club. They manage to slip away without paying for their meal and end up at his house. Toddy's ex-lover shows up the following morning, as Victoria is wearing his clothes. He mistakes her for a man and she literally kicks him out. Toddy then gets the idea to transform Victoria into a female impersonator, fooling everyone into believing she's a man. The two conspirators become rich and famous and a lot of crazy predicaments follow.The score by the late Henry Mancini gives the film its old-time, French and jazzy feeling. The songs are very enjoyable and catchy. Robert Preston and Lesley Ann Warren give over-the-top performances. It has a long running time, but well worth every minute. My score: 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Favorite movie quote - "Remember you're a drag queen." Hey! Are you ready for a 1980's movie about a woman pretending to be a man pretending to be a woman?? Well, kiddies, here's Victor/Victoria for you in all of its gender-deception glory.Containing plenty of bitchy remarks, sarcastic banter, and some very choice moments of zany, slapstick comedy, Victor/Victoria is a sexual charade of sorts that, for the most part, held up fairly well considering its subject matter.Set in Gay Paree (Paris) in 1934, a couple of this film's absolute highlights were - (1) Watching Lesley Ann Warren chew up the scenery as the gold-digging, blond bimbo, Norma Cassady - and - (2) Julie Andrews, as the gay deceiver, Victoria Grant, really belting it out in the "Le Jazz Hot!" musical number.On the down side - This Comedy/Farce ran on for far too long at 2 hours and 13 minutes. And the unwelcome, cornball romance that got inserted into the story was basically all fizzle and no spark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A woman pretending to be a man pretending to be a woman!?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In one of the first films to deal with homosexuality in a positive way, Blake Edwards skillfully combines a sparkling script, superb singing and dancing, and an excellent cast to come up with a masterpiece that teaches many lessons about life, love, and gender stereotypes.The story revolves around Victoria Grant (Julie Andrews), an English soprano struggling to make a living in Paris in 1934. Broke and desperate, she auditions for an indifferent nightclub owner (Peter Arne). He sends her packing, but his headliner, Carroll Todd, "Toddy to almost everyone who knows me (Robert Preston in one of his most impressive performances)," notices her and remembers her later when he comes upon her in a restaurant. The two form an unlikely alliance, first to get a free meal out of the restaurant, and ultimately to pass Victoria off as Count Victor Grazinski, Poland's most famous female impersonator. They manage to get "Victor" a gig at a famous Parisian nightclub. At the opening, Victoria meets King Marchand (James Garner), and sparks fly immediately, much to the chagrin of King's girlfriend (Leslie Anne Warren in a scene stealing performance), and the amazement of his bodyguard (Alex Karras, also scene stealing). From here on out, everything is open for question, as no one is who or what they seem to be, and the lines of gender and sexuality blur until they are almost indistinguishable.The writing of this film is superb, with the right touch of comic relief when things start to get heavy. While the story line is occasionally predictable, there are enough surprises to keep the viewer spellbound throughout. The dialogue sparkles. And the messages about gender and sexuality are handled with a lightness of touch that gets the message across far more effectively than a heavy handed approach would have.The singing and dancing are impeccable, as Andrews was at the height of her vocal abilities, and Preston was still an inspired performer. Especially notable is "Le Jazz Hot," where Andrews executes a two-octave slide without an audible break between chest and head voice. Warren's dance number is an hilarious send up of "Le Jazz Hot." Both versions of "The Shady Dame of Seville" are wonderful. "You and Me" is a lovely depiction of the friendship between Andrews' and Preston's characters. Andrews' rendition of "Crazy World" is heartbreaking and touching as she seems to be singing of her own no-win situation.Edwards assembles a strong cast for this film. Even the bit parts are well cast, especially notable is Sherloque Tanney as a bumbling private detective. Warren does the blond bimbo to hilarious perfection. Karras gives a credible performance as a gay man unexpectedly discovering both love and friendship. Preston is spot on as a gay man whose jocularity hides a painful past. Unfortunately, Preston and Karras get little screen time together, and there isn't a lot of chemistry between them in the time they do get as a couple, but it is wonderful to see a gay couple that stays together at the end of the film. Garner's confusion over his attraction to first Victor then Victoria is believable, as is his discomfort in having to "play gay" for his lover. His loyalty to her, even when it could cost him everything, is touching. And Andrews carries the film with an intelligent performance as a woman who first finds emancipation in pretending to be a man, but ultimately finds it to be a trap from which she must escape to find true happiness.A sparkling gem of a film which can be enjoyed again and again without losing its brilliance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Victor/Victoria is one of my all-time favorite films. I just totally love the whole woman/man/woman storyline and the way that Blake Edwards chose to deal with the very hard subject matter of homosexuality, especially in the early 1930's was very well done and extremely humorous.The acting is superb. Julie Andrews is a supreme actress and for once, Edwards doesn't waste his wife's talents as both a actress and a singer, as he has done in some of his other films. Robert Preston is the best thing about this film. His characterization of Toddy, the happy-go lucky gay guy was superb. He made Toddy a very real and human character by displaying both a touching and vulnerable side. He was nominated for an Oscar, too bad he didn't win because he definitely deserved it! James Garner and Lesley Ann Warren add a nice touch with their supporting roles of King Marchand and Norma, the Marilyn-Monroeish floozy girlfriend. The musical numbers are outstanding. Even if you don't like the rest of the film, you will love the music, guaranteed! Wonderful score by Henry Mancini &amp; Leslie Bricusse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Gayest Paree Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1964 Blake Edwards had directed his wife Julie Andrews in her film debut The Americanization Of Emily which James Garner costars with her and Henry Mancini wrote a fine title song for the film. The film was sort of a trial run before Andrews was launched full blast by Walt Disney in Mary Poppins.This fine team reunited 18 years later for the gender defying comedy Victor Victoria and Mancini wrote a few songs for Julie Andrews and Robert Preston and Lesley Ann Warren to do. A decade later Julie Andrews had it adapted to the Broadway stage for her.Andrews is starving in Paris, poor as a match girl, ready to lick the spaghetti sauce off a bib when she falls in with gay performer Robert Preston who is equally on his uppers. With conventional acts, neither is getting anywhere. But when Preston gets the idea to pass Andrews off as a man who is a female impersonator, they are a success. They even pretend to be lovers to keep the masquerade going.It all starts to unravel when visiting American gangster James Garner and his moll Lesley Ann Warren drop in to the nightclub. Andrews gets his hormones going and he's not sure why. Going in drag is an old movie story. Everyone from Katharine Hepburn to Gabby Hayes has done it on the screen. But the questions about sexual identity and gender attraction were never so provocatively raised before until Victor Victoria.Andrews and Preston were both in Blake Edwards immediately preceding film SOB and both had a pair of outrageous parts in that one also which I highly recommend. Andrews and Preston got rewarded with Oscar nominations, she for Best Actress and Preston for Best Supporting Actor. Julie lost to Meryl Streep for Sophie's Choice and Preston lost to Lou Gossett, Jr. for an Officer And A Gentleman.But saddest for me was Lesley Ann Warren who did a marvelous job recreating a throwback role from all those old gangster films of the Thirties. Her part was just the kind you used to see Joan Blondell or Glenda Farrell play to perfection. She was nominated for Best Supporting Actress, but lost to Jessica Lange for Tootsie.In fact Victor Victoria was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Art &amp;Set Direction and Best Adapted Screenplay. It did win in a category that seems like it was created for the film, Best Adapted Music and Musical Score. That was a new one on me when I saw it.Over 25 years after it was made Victor Victoria is still one fresh and naughty item. And a milestone in the mainstream for GLBT themed films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A down on her luck singer (Julie Andrews) in 1930s Paris suddenly hits the big time when she is advised by a gay cabaret performer (Robert Preston) to become a female impersonator. However, then having to also be a man pretending to be a woman adds its own set of complications, especially as she starts being wooed by night club owner King Marchand (James Garner), himself on the run from the Chicago mob.Funny, catchy and even a little portent-giving, Edwards' LGBT musical comedy is a true treat, and one of the man's finest hours as a director and writer. Leading the charge is an absolutely magnetic lead in Andrews, who reminds us why she was one of the great talents of her generation, deftly balancing comedy and drama while proving her singing chops, having to adopt a slightly masculine bass a number of times.That in turn brings us to the cheeky yet peppy songs by maestro Henry Mancini, which cover a nice variety of different styles with the highlight being the flamenco-spired 'Shady Dame From Seville' and often squeeze a good chuckle or nine in for good measure. Of course, the film's biggest ace is its smart and witty script, which offered a far more balanced look at homosexuality years than was considered even an acceptable thought at the time (especially given how close this was to things like the AIDS scare), as well as rather compelling gender satire that pokes fun at our constructs of what is masculine versus feminine and milks them for all they're worth. And of course, being an Edwards production there is some gut busting slapstick on display too, especially concerning the mob.Really, do I need to say more? Great people made a great movie about a great subject. Yeah, didn't think so. Just go see the damn thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blake Edwards produced a great history of comedy films and in this one where he writes and directs his wife Julie Andrews is a very solid effort. The king of the Pink Panther series, this movie combines and excellent cast with a great script adapted from Rheinhol Schnuzel and Hans Hoemburg's works. This is not the first time this concept was brought to the screen but it is one of the better efforts.Turns out Edwards is married to the right woman as Andrews in this one is as good as it gets for the role of Victor/Victoria. Henry Mancini's music and her singing work well together. The under appreciated Robert Preston is perfectly cast as the queen of the plot. Alex Karras has what turns out to be his best film role as he shows acting skill in support here. James Garner is solid here though it is later in the film before he actually gets any script to work with. Lesley Ann Warren is good as the straight sexual woman who gets to play Victors jealous rival, and she gets a musical number and does well with it as a bonus.For an era of the 1980's where Musical Films are considered dead on arrival in theaters, this one does a great job staging a semi- musical in solid fashion. This film is the beginning of a coming out for gay folks and mixes in comedy very well. It is a film that has all the tools to make the concept more real though it did have some films and television prior which had already explored the ground of being gay.It uses the cast perfectly and Edwards screen adaptation is first rate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A female singer is struggling to find work. She hits on the plan of impersonating a male singer. While this might be good for her professionally, it complicates her personal life.Good, but not great. The problem is that director Blake Edwards can't commit to whether this is a comedy or a drama, so hedges his bets. The comedy mostly consists of one-liners, and in some ways diminishes the point the drama could have made. The drama had heaps of potential: the search for sexual identity, gay rights, women's rights, but it all seems skirted over. However, in the 80s these were quite topical, and issues worth raising.Still, reasonably entertaining and Julie Andrews gives a superb performance in the lead role.</fullReview>

The time period its set in definitely emphasizes the inequalities faced by individuals of that era. Like majority movies, the love triangle prevalent between the characters. Even a quintessential sport playing, hands-on, misogynistic male wouldn't take offence to the film, because it is so well structured, with riveting characters. The film has been dubbed as a modern classic, and I agree confidently with that. Even though we have modern forward from the male dominated society, still in our modern society we tend to have the issues dealt with in the film Victor Victoria. The film takes on characteristics of a woman, by this I mean its mysterious, effortless, has ''ups and downs'' while keeping the topics universal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Victor Victoria Gender Roles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the film begins it is easy to identify that the film is old because of the credits and drawings, they are basic and not modern and technical like the movies of the 21st century.The film is set in Paris in 1934 just after the depression. In the opening scene homosexuality is evident, which sets the tone for the movie. The name Victor Victoria is a play on words, as one is generally a boy's name and the other is generally a girl's name, yet being of the same context it could be predicted that it is the same person or a gender battle.There is a lot of foreshadowing in the beginning of the movie. Victoria is starving and sees a man eating all this food, almost like a prince and the pauper setting, she then faints. The crux of the movie is when Victoria puts on a man's clothes. We begin to see a major contrast of how men and women differ, as well as the privileges and advantages there are of being a male in Paris in the 1930's.This is a modern classic as the issues that this movie deals with still rings true today. Women are far more accepted in the work place and they do run in high circles in these days, but in many countries, traditions and religions, women are still inferior to men. The issue of homosexuality is something that is still a tender issue to discuss in most cultures. It has become more acceptable to speak about it openly, and it has become more acceptable to people, however many people still see it as wrong. The issue of one man accepting homosexuality is still a major thing today. Perhaps the thing is that men feel that it makes them weaker, when in actual fact, in may make them stronger, and help them to find their identities and self acceptance. The bodyguard is what you would consider as a real tough man, yet he is gay, and it deals with the stereotype of what a gay man should look like and act like. The bodyguard also pretends to be this tough man to fit into the mould of a man, this type is issue happens every day in the world as people are still afraid to speak openly about their sexuality.Comedies are often used for serious issues. The humour deflects the real issue at hand; it deals with it without actually having a direct issue. This is a musical comedy, however the music only happens when the actors are on stage doing a production, it does not occur throughout the movie in everyday life.Humour exposes truth in a tolerable way and gives a good feeling about the issue; it leaves a positive taste in your mouth about a very taboo or serious social issue. Humour exposes the truth and breaks down the stereotypes and stigmas of society. It may help people see both sides of a story and understand other people's perspectives. This modern classic is relatable and it deals with issues from past to present, it stands the test of time and is enjoyable through all the ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Set in Paris 1934, Toddy collide with the brainwave of passing Victoria off as a man. Victor is a success, King is infatuated and persuaded that "Victor" is not a man.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film "Victor Victoria", which means man versus female, deals with gender stereotyping, double standards, homosexuality, and appearance versus reality. The film was directed by Blake Edwards. There are three keys actors in the movie, which is Victoria (a female singer who is eager for a gig), Toddy (a flashy night singer with comedic abilities), and King Marchan (a Chicago nightclub proprietor and mobster).Victoria is kind-hearted, authentic, eager and very creative at being Victor but she is in the low class, lower than Norma and eventually there's growth in the social class. Toddy is humorous, sensitive, curious, careless, yet he speaks his mind. King Marchan pretends to be happy at first but he is a criminal, superior, swanky, and prosperous. There are two scenes that focus heavily on the theme of the movie. The first scene is where King Marchan sneaks into Victoria and Toddy's hotel in order to figure out her identity. In this scene there were medium shots, close-up shots, subjective shots and long shots. The editing's were jump cuts. The camera movements were tracking, pan, and tilt. The camera angles were high angle camera and low angle camera. The sound was a score but it felt sneaky and stalker. The second scene is where King Marchan sneaks out of Victoria and Toddy's hotel because he came to a conclusion about her identity. In this scene there were long shots, close-up shots, medium shots, and subjective shots. The editing's were jump cuts. The camera movements were pan, tracking, and tilt. The camera angles were low angle camera and high angle camera. The sound was a score but it felt sneaky, calm, stalker, and under-control.The first scene is where King Marchan sneaks into Victoria and Toddy's hotel in order to figure out her identity. Firstly, there are black and white colors, which means mystery and simplicity. Secondly, there are brown, darkness, and light, which means stability, ignorance, and safety. Furthermore, it is winter, there's snow, and the color is black, which means obscures, despair, and mourning. The second scene is where King Marchan sneaks out of Victoria and Toddy's hotel because he came to a conclusion about her identity. Firstly, there are black, white, orange, green, pink, blue, and red colors, which means sophistication, surrender, enthusiasm, inexperience, feminist, stability, and danger. Secondly, there is snow, it is winter, gold and brown colors, which means obscure, hibernate, power, and outdoor. Moreover, there's orange, darkness, and light, which means warmth, ignorant, and safety.If you really want a good laughter (suspense as belief), I will recommend this film to you because comedy is amusing; there are issues that can occur in reality and you shall enjoy it, eventually.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Blake Edwards farce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 1934 Paris. Carole "Toddy" Todd (Robert Preston) is a gay cabaret singer. Victoria Grant (Julie Andrews) is struggling to get a singing job and faints from starvation. Toddy is thrown out of his latest gig after starting a fight that trashes the club. Toddy comes up with an idea. Victoria pretends to be a man to get a job singing as a female impersonator with Toddy as her/his manager. Grant takes on the alter ego of gay Polish Count Victor Grazinski who was disowned by his family. Grant impresses leading agent Andre Cassell (John Rhys-Davies). King Marchand (James Garner) is the most successful nightclub owner in Chicago who finds Victor/Victoria irresistible. His girlfriend Norma Cassady (Lesley Ann Warren) is a real wildcat.There are some fine comedy being played. There are some hilarious gags in the restaurant early on. Robert Preston plays a homosexual like a real person. Julie Andrews is her charming self and she plays a man with equal charm. Blake Edwards does some of his best work. It takes on some gender bending sex slapstick farce with such a deft touch. It's never mean-spirited and has such joyous fun. The key role is James Garner. He has to be a manly man but also has a believable sensitive side. He is definitely the man for the job. And Robert Preston has a hilarious song and dance at the end. There are some great funny moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Ahead of It's Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie was way ahead of it's time as first saw it as a eight-year old back in Fla at the time. As it showed Julie Andrews being directed by her husband, the late and great Blake Edwards.He helped revive her career after Mary Popppins was typecasting her. As this proved to really help her shake that image. As she plays a poor female singer who is struggling to make ends meet. As she meets a gay singer who would become her manager, played by the great and late, Robert Preston.As after an argument with Preston's lover and Andrews punching him out, they make up her being a man pretending to be a woman singer. In order to make ends meet and it helps along the way winning both of them, fame and fortune.But Andrews finds out her personal life will clash when she meets the handsome James Gardner, who's bodyguard is also gay, played by the late great Alex Karras and his nagging girlfriend, Leslie Ann Warren.Gardner sees right through Andrews and the two fall in love as Andrews must maintain this image despite a snooping PI wanting to expose her. The film really helped out her career in the 1980s with Edwards.Seen this movie thousands of times, as it was ahead of it's time for the taboo 1980s. RIP Alex Karras, Blake Edwards, and Robert Edwards!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You and Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film grows in your heart a little stronger each time you watch it; it is like a genuinely good friend returning to visit you. Blake Edwards directed Victor Victoria with such an affection and tenderness that I think no one can help but be moved. You'll never find yourself tired watching it again and again because more you know the characters the more you love them, the funnier the situations and dialogs become, the more you enjoy the story. 'You and Me' which is sung by Julie Andrew and Robert Preston before the audience reminds us that you can be strong and free only if you know who you are and if you are true to who you are. Julie Andrews' song Crazy World calls us to keep loving others no matter what. Costumed or disguised you'll find Blake Edwards' comedy Victor Victoria to be bright, funny and thriving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confused sexual identity and great fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in Paris during the depression, Victor/Victoria is a great comedy that serves up one gag after another. When it's over, we know that it wasn't just the laughs that we appreciate but the movie's take on how to judge people, when we look beyond the sexual stereotypes.Robert Preston (a actor in musicals from the 1950's) is a mentor for the talented Julie Andrews, who plays a man pretending to be a woman. This trickery was masterminded by Preston, who gives her a shoulder to cry on when things go wrong. There is no romance in their friendship. Preston is a confirmed gay entertainer totally at ease with his own sexuality. Yet they are the best of friends. Into this seemingly confused relationship comes James Garner, a Chicago nightclub owner and confirmed heterosexual, who cannot understand his attraction to Andrews, when he learns that she is a he and is determined to get the facts. In this adventure, he finds himself in some ridiculous predicaments along with his bodyguard, played by Alex Karras. Karras comes to an awakening of his own in the process. The high-strung Lesley Ann Warren, Garner's girlfriend, serves up some hilarious lines and one steamy dance for the audience.Gags, riots at several venues, characters acting out-of-character all make this movie great entertainment. Blake Edwards, the director and husband of Julie Andrews, shows the same screwball comedic talent that went into his direction of the Pink Panther movies. It is great to see the chemistry between James Garner and Julie Andrews who were so good in the Americanization of Emily.Some reviews say this movie is crude but this is hardly a correct description. Underneath the earthy humor and bizarre twists and turns, there is much to admire in this hilarious movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ain't Robert Preston grand??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I too loved this movie because it stayed within its context and didn't stray too far off the subject line nor involve too many off-the-subject subplots. But what I wanted to say about the final Robert Preston number is this: Some time ago - it has to be 3 or 4 years - I read or heard or saw an interview with someone, I just can't remember where, that this was a dress rehearsal or a final dress rehearsal (?) that the director surreptitiously had them film without Robert Preston's knowledge. Then it turned out so well that they decided to just go ahead and use it. I honestly remember that but can't remember where I remember it from, dang, old age is the pits!Also does anyone remember Robert Preston in another movie where he is married to an older woman and after she dies he wants to have an affair with Mary Tyler Moore? The movie also features Sam Waterson as Mary's married boyfriend and I believe Sylvia Sydney as Robert Preston's wife. I remember 'ratiosination' and the finding of many twenty dollar bills in the black books in the library. Maybe this was a TV movie which would explain why I haven't seen it for years. Don't they resurrect these things sometimes? I wish someone would resurrect that one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was originally made in Germany in the early 1930's. This 1982 MGM film written &amp; directed by Blake Edwards is not the laugh filled riot many people said it was on its original release. It is still entertaining,mainly because of its cast. Mary Poppins,Harold Hill &amp; Maverick are a mighty trio. For those that do not know who I am referring to, JULIE ANDREWS, ROBERT PRESTON &amp; JAMES GARNER are in top form, very ably assisted by Lesley Anne Warren &amp; Alex Karas. The scenes these 2 are in are the funniest ones in the entire film. Mr. Karas has been in movies since,every time I see him I think of his surprising role here.One main problem I have was the songs, there was not one single memorable one. They were cute &amp; one very funny, but none that lasted.This problem was typical of many musicals,not enough real good songs.Ratings: *** (out of 4) 85 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10_</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WHAT A Drag!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given the German origins of this film and the fact that the plot was right down his strasse I'm surprised that the great Billy Wilder never tackled a remake; be that as it may, Victor Saville directed Jessie Matthews in the initial remake one year - 1934 - after the original was released and then Blake Edwards threw his own hat in the ring in 1982. There's a lot to like here, Hank Mancini's lovely evocative - of both Paris and the time - opening wordless music leads us effortlessly into the milieu and a short time later Robert Preston delivers the best song in the movie, a very clever Leslie Bricusse stressing the GAY in Gay Paree. There is also some tasty dialogue, again most of it delivered by Preston but just after halfway it begins to sag a little and we get the feeling it's rushing to tie everything together. Overall a very enjoyable romp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious, surprisingly hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hilarious is the one word that kept popping while I was watching the movie. James Garner's reaction when Julie Andrews removed her head gear after her first performance still keeps me laughing out loud. I guess the sexuality issues covered in the film are pretty serious, while I don't really care about sticking or junking out any (gay or otherwise) stereotypes, I wouldn't care to watch the movie without the humor to hold it together. Neither do I really care about Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan kind of romantic comedies. So the romance wasn't beckoning me to watch this film. Its like watching "As You Like It", with a campier sense of humor. Having said that, the chemistry between all the actors (not just Mr. Garner and Ms. Andrews, all of the them) was great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a scream!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All that I can say about Victor/Victoria is that it is great: a scream from start to finish. The restaurant scenes are classics. Robert Preston is particularly good and Julie Andrews positively shines. Julie Andrews in particular is much maligned as an actress as to my mind, she has always given an honest performance. James Garner and Alex Karras bounce well off each other. The musical numbers tell the story alongside the film, unlike a lot of musicals where the songs don't add anything to the story. Jazz Hot and Crazy World, two of her best songs in the movie, are brilliant. If Jazz Hot doesn't get your toes tapping, you just ain't got no rhythm.Blake Edwards has a real sense of the ridiculously funny. The story is simple.Victoria (Julie Andrews), a down on her luck opera singer, meets Carroll Todd (Robert Preston), also known as Toddy, an aging gay entertainer. Toddy transforms the desperate Victoria into Count Victor Grezhinski, a gay Polish Count who is disowned for being gay. Victor becomes an immediate success. Julie's transformation from woman to man is well done. Slapstick moments are provided by Charles Bovin (Herb Tanney), the incompetent private D. Bovin obviously doesn't know when not to carry an umbrella but Tanney does know how to make the audience laugh.John Rhys-Davies as Andre Cassell provides his usual high standard performance. In some ways, his character in this is reminiscent of his role in the original Indiana Jones movie.Altogether a lot of fun and a great laugh.</fullReview>

Easily as funny as some of the Pink Panther movies. This is very funny stuff that doesn't make a mockery of the material. Julie Andrew and James Garner are perfectly cast. Robert Preston gives an Oscar caliber performance in a supporting role. The score by Henry Mancini is fantastic. Possibily one of his best. I recently saw his daughter Monica in concert and she commented that her father was very proud of this score which really is a key element of the movie.This is not to be missed and did I say it was funny!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>is it a man is it a woman or is it Dame Julie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dame Julie Andrews playing a woman pretending to be a man pretending to be a woman, the basis for Victor/Victoria.Set in 1930's Paris with some delightful sets and great cinematography we watch as this witty and engaging story unfolds. Julie Andrews is fantastic in the lead role, her voice is used to its best advantage and with such an enjoyable script her acting is also worthy of the Golden Globe she received in 1983. The musical numbers are very well done in fact we have to wait until the musical film revival of this century to see any done better.There are some cracking performances from James Garner, suitably macho, Graham Stark as the waiter, very funny, Michael Robbins as the sleazy hotel manager and Lesley Ann Warren in a delightfully horrid part she captures perfectly. The film though belongs to one person Robert Preston, this is a tour de force. His acting captures the nuances of a gay man without parody and the final musical number is one of the best things I have ever witnessed on film, so funny and yet at the end he manages to convey such emotion, truly a wonderful actor and performance.For a mainstream film made in 1982 there is a lot of reference to gay culture/lifestyle, it works because it is not brought to the fore. It's just there in the background punctuating the whole story.This is such an enjoyable film with fine production values and a great cast well worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got this film for my birthday a few days ago, and I must say that I have talked about nothing else since. I downloaded the music promptly and learned some of the most memorable lines from it. I have had a love affair with Julie Andrews (not literally) since I was pretty much brought up by Disney, and in particular Mary Poppins. I then watched The Sound of Music and instantly she became my obsession and my favourite actress because her singing and acting cannot be rivalled. Anyway, this film is one of the funniest films I've watched in a while. For one, Julie kicks ass (and I say that literally, I don't normally use American phrases) and I've never really seen her act like that and I was EXTREMELY amazed! Who wouldn't be? You've seen Julie in practically perfect films and suddenly she's playing one of the most imaginative characters created by Blake Edwards in one of the strangest films ever to be made.So strange that it is bloody fantastic!</fullReview>

Well, this WAS made like they used to.Julie Andrews shines in both acting and voice Robert Preston is the glue that binds the facets in this film and is as amazing as always. Even though his character acting tends to steal the scenes in most roles, he manages to be 'just enough' over the edge but not 'too much' over the edge in this one.James Garner is at his best in this role IMHO. Lesley Ann Warren cracks me up with her bimbo blonde role and Alex Karras lends amazing support.This film has it all (very well done) from drama to music to several modes of comedy.I wish they would make more like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sparkling Musical Comedy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>VICTOR/VICTORIA is a thoroughly entertaining and, at times, raucously funny musical about a down and out singer (Julie Andrews) who becomes a great star as a female impersonator. Though I never for a moment believe her as a man, Andrews is fully invested in the role of Victoria Grant/Count Victor Gryzinski and gives one of her finest performances (Her rendition of "Le Jazz Hot" is smokin'). Andrews has never been more adult or more sexy on screen. James Garner is charming and amusing as Victoria's confused suitor, King Marchand. Robert Preston, playing radically against type, should have won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance as Andrews' gay friend/confidante/manager, Toddy. Lesley Ann Warren turns in the scene-stealing performance of her career and delivers some of the biggest laughs in the films as Norma Cassidy, King's obnoxious, not-too-bright moll and kudos to Alex Karras for his understated turn as King's closeted bodyguard. There is a slow moment here and there, but this film is a very entertaining ride for the most part, thanks to the love and care of Blake Edwards, who always manages to find the laugh or smile when appropriate and knows how to make his wife look good. The film's power was later diluted by an inferior Broadway musical, but stick with the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Fitting Tribute</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read that Victor/Victoria is director Blake Edwards' cinematic "love song" to its star, Julie Andrews, his wife of 13 years at the completion of this film. Keeping this in mind after my first viewing of it, all I can say is...he must wholly, unequivocally adore her. (Now I do, too.)I experienced this film at Arizona State University's September 2005 tribute to Blake Edwards, and despite my euphoria at meeting Mr. Edwards in person prior to the screening, my extremely favorable review of the movie is as unbiased as possible. Victor/Victoria is simply an excellent piece of entertainment, with dazzling color, beautiful songs, snappy, terse dialogue, and a seamless combination of romance, drama, comedy and music that only Blake Edwards could create.Perhaps it is the truth in that observation that adds so much charm to it. Andrews is inarguably beautiful and presents us - or should I say amazes us - with her flawless musical numbers and incredibly impressive vocal range. Her comedic timing is surprisingly good, too. Those who, like me, are only familiar with Andrews as a wholesome, motherly family-film character will not necessarily be scandalized by this movie, but they will marvel at the complexities of her talent and how well she plays this role. Supporting characters Robert Preston and James Garner, the latter of whom is convincing as the handsome love interest (and does little else in the film, but it doesn't detract a bit - best leave the spotlight to Andrews, Preston and Mancini) are hilarious and keep the pace of the film fast enough to intrigue and delight, yet moderate enough to let us marvel in the aesthetic impressiveness and comedic and dramatic aspects of the film.Henry Mancini's musical collaboration with Edwards, in producing the soundtrack to this movie, is breathtaking. The theme song is stirringly romantic, almost haunting, and it is woven into several pivotal moments in the film in such clever ways that it infuses undertones of romance and drama to simple dialogue scenes. If you don't find yourself humming "Crazy World" in the days after the credits roll on this one, you must not've had the sound up.Even if you're hesitant to sample "newer" musicals, as I was, or if you're unsure of your ability to sit through a film with Fraulein Maria as an imposter drag queen in gay Paree, please don't let your preconceptions steer you away from this gem. Victor/Victoria is pure entertainment with memorable, lovable characters, phenomenal acting, delightful elements of several genres of film, and an unforgettable soundtrack. What a surprising, enduring piece of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun to Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Julie Andrews, James Garner, Lesley Ann Warren, Robert Preston and cast are just brilliant. This movie is a hoot to watch. I really enjoyed the visuals, set decorations and costumes in the movie. It was probably a risk in the early 80's to do a musical, but thank goodness this movie was brought to screen. It is fun, campy and brilliantly casted. The only movies I had know Julie Andrews from was Mary Poppins and Sound of Music when I first saw this. It was wonderful to see her in this spunky, liberating and comedic role. James Garner was very handsome (although the man is old enough to be my grandpa). The music sung by Julie is superb and right on. Lesley Ann Warren is the icing on the cake for this movie. I don't think I have seen her in a better role. The rest of the ensemble cast is just as talented. This movie is one of my all time favorite "modern" musicals... Enjoy watching it with a big bowl of popcorn or something carb friendly.

		<fullReview>It is Paris in the 1930's and Victoria Grant (Andrews) is a struggling singer who can't seem to cut a break since her husband ran off and absconded with the funds needed for the theater company they had co-founded. She is so destitute that not only does she faint repeatedly from hunger and offer to sleep with her landlord for one meatball, but resorts to sticking a cockroach in her food at a restaurant after enjoying a large meal. At the restaurant, she reunites with Carroll "Toddy" Todd (Preston) a singer who had seen her audition earlier in the day and happens to have become recently unemployed himself. The two strike up a quick friendship, and overnight, he comes up with a scheme to make the two of them a lot of money. Victoria will disguise herself as Victor, a Polish count, who in turn performs as a drag queen. So it's a woman disguised as a man pretending to be a woman. (Get it?) Through Toddy's connections, the two quickly get bookings and Victor/Victoria becomes the toast of Paris, catching the eye of King Marchand (Garner), a nightclub owner from Chicago who is connected with the Mob. While Marchand's ditzy Harlow-esquire girlfriend Norma (Lesley Ann Warren) is delighted that Victoria is actually a man, (after seeing how gaga King was for him/her) their "relationship" falls apart when King, convinced that Victor is actually a woman is obsessed with finding out the truth and seducing her."Victor/Victoria" is one of the most delightful musicals that I have ever seen, mainly because it's not a "normal" musical. Firstly, the subject matter is definitely not general musical fare; "gay Paris" lives up to its name in this film, with several of the main characters being openly gay, as well as most of the performers. This has always been an iconic film in the gay community (at least the gay communities I've been familiar with) both because of the nonchalance with which the topic is addressed and the respect they, as a community, are given. Secondly, a lot of musicals sacrifice story lines or plots in order to compensate for the many song and dance routines. This is not the case with "Victor/Victoria", which has a fulfilling, clever and entertaining story filled with strong characters. Also, a lot of times, musicals tend to just launch into song, creating really implausible moments (though I'm not completely bagging this; I firmly believe that a lot of the attraction to musicals is a certain level of escapism); rather, the songs in "Victor/Victoria" firmly belong where they are because they are all part of one big cabaret act.The performances in "Victor/Victoria" are first-rate, led by Julie Andrews and Robert Preston. Andrews, not traditionally a favorite actress of mine simply because I generally loathe musicals and she just happens to star in two of the most famous ones of all, is luminous as Victoria. She was 47 when this was filmed and she looked and sounded stunning. The chemistry between she and Preston (The Music Man, The Last Starfighter) is so good that I found myself grinning through most of their scenes together. Their friendship was truly believable and incredibly charming. Though the two aforementioned performances were great, and Garner was funny as the (pardon the expression) straight man, it was his comic foil Lesley Ann Warren that really stole the show. Her vicious and ditzy characterization of Norma was so funny that I found I laughed the hardest when she was on the screen, even though her part was smaller than the others', and her standout musical number "Chicago, Illinois" is worth the price of admission alone.Blake Edwards certainly knows comedy, and while some of his films have been missteps (Skin Deep) he has created and/or directed some wonderful films like "Breakfast at Tiffanys" and "The Pink Panther". Those films worked because they had heart, rich stories and talented actors, and in the case of "The Pink Panther", perfect comic timing. "Victor/Victoria" is a hybrid of the two films in that it is at once a love story and a story about friendship, yet it is also a farce and absolutely hilarious. Throw in some great music and you have a wonderful, entertaining film that, while isn't an "important" film (although I really do like the acceptance of all things homosexual, from a humanistic angle) with a huge message, it is one that is truly a treasure. 8/10 --Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blake Edward approaches the style and skill of Billy Wilder in this musical comedy about the clash of gay and straight life. A clever script and inspired musical numbers certainly help make this a superb entertainment. "Le Hot Jazz" is one of the most inventive song and dance show stoppers ever committed to film and I didn't want the number to end. "The Shady Dame from Seville" performed first by Andrews and then by Robert Preston in outrageous drag runs a close second. It all adds up to a great deal of fun and fancy and manages to make a sly commentary on the state of the sexes. Alex Karras revelation is touching as well as comedic.

		<fullReview>I can't believe how much I loved Victor/Victoria. It is charming, witty and a lot of fun, and you can tell everybody involved with it had a ball. To be honest, I wasn't sure whether I would like this movie. I thought it would be a vehicle for Julie Andrews like Star! was and little more, and the story at first I wasn't sure about and I can't quite put my finger on why.I am so glad though that I saw it, because it was an absolute hoot and infinitely better than expected. This is so much more than a Julie Andrews vehicle, while it is not her best film it is one of her more enjoyable ones. As for Andrews she is wonderful. Here she does play an atypical role on the surface, looking at Mary Poppins and Sound of Music you would never guess Andrews would play a bloke. But she does play the role with wit and charm, and to be doubly sure she was comfortable she is even given some fun songs to show off her very angelic voice, she is especially impressive in the show-stopper that is Le Jazz Hot with very clever execution of the fiendishly difficult two-octave slide.That's not all. Andrews is supported by an equally impressive cast. James Garner is dashing and immensely likable as the heterosexual troubled by his attraction to Andrews' character. Robert Preston is also outrageously camp but in a good way- Shady Dame from Seville is hilarious-, while Lesley Ann Warren(very funny and very sexy), John Rhys Davies and especially Alex Karras give stellar supporting turns as well.The songs are just great, especially the moving Crazy World. The melodies are memorable and fun and the lyrics are deliciously witty, and I have to say the cast did great justice to those songs not just in the performances but in making them their own too. Just as good is the choreography, which manages to be sprightly and energetic. Blake Edwards also deserves a lot of credit for two things, one is his funny and witty script, the other is his affectionate and tender direction while never being too showy.The production values are top drawer, the sets and scenery are very elegant and pleasing on the eyes, the lighting is never dull and the costumes especially the drag costumes are colourful arrays. The story and romance is interesting with very rare a false or dull note even with the lengthy length.All in all, a delightful movie and a must see for fans of Julie Andrews, Blake Edwards, musicals or James Garner. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. The cast is perfect. I wasn't a fan of Julie Andrews till I saw her in this and Le Jazz Hot is one of my favorite musical numbers. Julie was hot and the dancing amazing to watch. James Garner was never more appealing and Leslie Ann Warren stole the movie. Robert Preston is in a class by himself. The rest of the cast were all perfect.Every scene was a jewel whether for comedy, romance, interesting social commentary done with a light touch, or simply touching. When Julie as Victor is given a cigar by King Marchand, she coughs and then when offered a glass of water he/she casually dunks the cigar in it. I love the scene when the private detective is outside the hotel room window in the rain and lightening hits his umbrella.The final scene where Robert Preston does The Shady Lady of Seville in drag, for a moment, had me think that it was an outtake and the cast was just having fun. The ending was absolutely joyous and had me wanting to step into the scene to join the cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't comment on movies that have tons of reviews already, unless I really feel compelled to do so. But, I have to say that every once in a while you're going to come across a perfect film. This is one of them. Obviously a labor of love for those involved, this tale of 1930s "Gay" Paris is Julie Andrews, James Garner, Robert Preston, and Lesley Ann Warren at their best. The acting is incredible, but what really makes it so memorable is Blake Edwards' knack for writing a crisp, witty, and delicious script with three-dimensional characters. Warren's character had to be inspired at least in part by Jean Harlow in "Dinner at Eight" with Wallace Beery. She is also a little reminiscent of Jean Hagen's "Lina Lamont" in "Singin' in the Rain" but not really. I can't tell you how many times I've seen it. But Henry Mancini's Oscar-winning score and Leslie Bricusse's songs are like home to me. It has a kind of a french farce quality to it, with Garner and Alex Karras slipping from room to room. If you've never seen this movie, based on a 1933 German film,treat yourself. You should go into it, knowing nothing about it. You'll be rewarded twice fold. Encore! Encore! Victor, Victoria!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Full-bodied slapstick comedy-romance from Blake Edwards has a penniless female singer in 1930s Paris finding big success after passing herself off as a gay male performer who does a drag act. In the lead, Julie Andrews isn't especially convincing as a man who passes for female, but Edwards probably didn't mean her to be. This glossy, raucous outing with music works best when it's a flight-of-fancy--an old-fashioned screwball vehicle kept modern by its sexual ambiguity--and less so when it plumbs the meaning of life. Andrews, ever the Mary Poppins, eventually begins to sermonize on the importance of her liberation, which then causes some consternation when gangster-lover James Garner continues to try and win points against her. The movie wants to have it both ways: be a fluffy, safe turn for the stars but also score personal touchdowns for all sides. Though it does runs itself into the ground taking its themes too seriously, the performers never lose their energy and affection, and there are some very big laughs. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like it... I really like it! Love it? Maybe not as much as others do, but its a fun movie. Its got a slightly clever device working. The real clever twist would have been to have a Male actor playing the part of Victoria... You know, a real man playing a women pretending to be a man performing as a woman. Get it? Then, if they managed to cast just such a talented man, James Garner's attraction to Victor/Victoria would have some real edge. I'm not saying Garner's King Marchand should be made out as gay, but the conceit would have supported the plot device nicely. As it is, the movie is very likable. Not fantastic, but extremely well made. It's got some decent musical numbers, stylish sets, tight direction and editing, and some good dialog, especially Robert Preston's. And as another commenter points out, an excellent homage to an earlier generation's film making. But it does drag later on and gets heavy with the homo PC chatter. Cabaret made its points through character and plot, not so much through overly serious verbal exchanges. But maybe, considering its production date - a decade after Cabaret - its an unfair criticism, what with all of the homophobia that still plagued our society. And still does.</fullReview>

I've always been a Blake Edwards fan, and this is probably his second best film, after "The Great Race."

		<fullReview>Not for one moment could I believe that Julie Andrews could play a man! What I did believe was that Julie Andrew's character, Victoria could pull it off! This was one of my first major film openings I attended when arriving in Los Angeles. I was at the premiere when this was shown for Filmex and I love this film! The musical numbers were cute, the story was fun! Robert Preston was wonderful as Toddy, helping Andrew's character be a man for...work -- during very bad, dreary and economic times and obvious separation of classes in Europe. Victoria had a big singing talent, but that still couldn't get her a decent steady job!!! Not until she was turned into Victor by the fledgling talent agent Toddy. Who couldn't see "he" was a "she?" Nowadays, sure. Back then....errr.... maybe. Which is what makes the film. It goes well until the farce hits a snag when James Garner's character King enters the picture. And how wonderful was Leslie Ann Warren as King's girl? Her comedic performance, singing and dancing made the movie more entertaining. Alex Karras as King's body guard adds to the films moments. This movie is fun, it's grand, its musical, it's directed well by Blake Edwards, has great staging numbers, and the ending was funny as they come! I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

Preston steals the show, though, in the role of the flamboyant Queen who guides Andrews "Pygmalion" style. I guess that sort of makes "Victor/Victoria" a sort of twisted opportunity for Andrews to play "My Fair Lady" on the screen. What a fair lady!Preston deserved the Oscar, but he sure showed (again) all that he had. He provides many of the film's best moments, but the climax with him becoming the new "Victoria" is just a bit too much.Fine direction by Edwards, particularly in the first 20 minutes or so of the film, in which the visuals are very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just spectacular-much better than Chicago</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing that struck me when I was seeing this film where the beautiful Art Nouveau and Art Deco sets,somewhat like in Patroni Griffi's Divina Creatura or the famous Valentino-Nazimova version of Camille. But beyond that it was as treat to watch this film over and over again. The scenes are beautifully crafted,witty and everything seems luxurious and fairytale-like without being tasteless. Like in Chicago,it's the story about the rise of a music-hall star. Yet Victoria Grant(beautifully acted by Julie Andrews) isn't Velma Kelly or Roxie Hart:she isn't doing it just for fun or to escape the death sentence(though,at least in the beginning,she seems "sentenced to death" trough starvation,being at first extremely poor),she really is a talented,yet under-appreciated mezzo. Trough the help of a gallant homosexual artist(Robert Preston in his probably most memorable part),actually more devoted and caring towards her than a heterosexual man,she pretends to be a female impersonator and due to this slippery male-female game she soon attracts the well-deserved attention a more high-profile performance(e.g. opera,her actual preoccupation)failed to achieve. Victoria resembles Sally Bowles from Cabaret:not only an innate performer,born to shine on stage every evening,but also everyone's buddy,informal and friendly without being vulgar,bohemian,always ready to have fun with or to cry on her shoulder,sometimes patronizing and stubborn,but always good-hearted,at the same time (genuinely,not theatrically)sensitive and vulnerable,in spite of her hard,androgynous,partying,eccentric outer shell essentially and overtly feminine deep inside. The boundaries of sexual identity are constantly and intelligently pushed in this film,leaving you wondering whether the characters are men or women;straight,gay or bi(not in as a deep,confusing psychological analysis,just as a Tinseltown extravaganza or a wild party from the Jazz Age-note that the events of this film are set in 1934);watching other films about the same period like,of course,Cabaret,Women in Love,Lucky Lady we noticed that in the twenties and thirties people handled their sexuality very openly,always eager to experiment,just for the fun/the thrills. Julie Andrews does a good job ridding herself of the Maria/Mary Poppins image,yet without destroying her charm both as performer and stylish diva:even if her character is moving with ease trough Parisian nightclubs and dancing,it still cannot take away that innocent magic and joy her radiant personality always brings up. The supporting cast is brilliant too:Lesley Ann Warren as a somewhat trashy vamp(in sharp contrast to Andrews' part),burlesque,noisy and vulgar in every scene,James Garner as the heterosexual gangster eventually falling for Victoria(a whole range of complications and comical situations being derived from that,everyone believing that Victoria is a man and therefore Mr.though guy being queer,which is unacceptable according to the mob's moral rules),then a bunch of typical Blake Edwards comical faces familiar to us from the Pink Panther series in extremely funny episodic appearances,like screaming:"Cockroach!". The music is stunning-lush and extravagant treats of nostalgic,genuine Jazz,the texts of the songs are humorous and witty-in comparison to that even Chicago seems an immature improvisation,nothing more than a cheap copy of this film's soundtrack-note that the song "All that Jazz", which Velma Kelly sings just at the beginning of Chicago sounds like a poor,tasteless copy of the timeless "Le Jazz Hot',she is even trying to imitate Julie Andrews' gestures,voice,appearance(unsuccessfully,that is). Victor/Victoria remains an unforgettable classic-its music,costumes,sets, and,above all,gifted performers being timelessly fascinating and entertaining.The perfect choice for every music-and art-lover,or whenever an escape from our stressing present into a glamorous,enthralling age is being craved for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another example of Blake Edwards at his best. This is an old-fashioned sex farce with an outstanding cast and many surprises. This was probably the only film I liked Alex Karras in -- and was he funny!! James Garner was a riot as King, a murky character with mob connections that come back to haunt him. However, the two performances that outshine them all are Julie Andrews in the eponymous role and Robert Preston as her gay mentor. In his final dance number, you can see the fun he was having the entire time and it is infectious. Surprisingly for a Blake Edwards film, the movie does not slow down to a crawl in the second act. This is probably his best-paced movie. It shows how brilliant the man can be when he wants. Skin Deep and A Fine Mess show how bad he can be when he doesn't care.You will NEVER regret watching this, although I would caution you to see it uncut, without interruption. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Fair Lady Impersonator! Julie Andrews In A Classic Comic Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Victor/Victoria (1982): Julie Andrews, Robert Preston, James Garner, Lesley Ann Warren, John Rhys-Davies, Alex Karras, Peter Arne, Norman Chancer, Graham Stark, Herb Tanney, Michael Robbins, David Gant, Maria Charles, John Cassady, Malcolm Jamieson, John Cassady, Mike Tezcan, Christopher Good, Matyelok Gibbs, Jay Benedict, Olivier Pierre, Martin Rayner, George Silver, Joanna Dickens, Terence Skelton, Ira Skriver, Neil Cunningham, Bill Monks, Elizabeth Vaughan, Peter Diamond, Derek Lyons, Nosher Powell...Director Blake Edwards, Screenplay Hans Hoemburg, Reinhold Schunzel.From 1982, this is Director Blake Edwards' most memorable comedy. He was married to Broadway singer/actress Julie Andrews (Mary Poppins, Sound Of Music) at the time of this film. His previous films were successful social comedies with satirical flair, "Breakfast At Tiffany's" and his "Pink Panther" films being the most acclaimed. Julie Andrews portrays Victoria Grant, a struggling, unsuccessful opera singer in 1930's America. Her homosexual friend Toddy (Robert Preston) decides to help her out through a great scheme. He passes her off as a man who dresses as a woman and sings as a woman, or a female impersonator/entertainer. Before long, things begin to take a turn for the worst when mob king King Marchand (James Garner) and his cronies begin to suspect that this female impersonator is a fraud. But King gradually falls for Victoria Grant, despite the fact that throughout the film she is believed to be Count Victor Grezhinski. King's vapid, bitchy girlfriend Norma Cassady is played by Lesley Ann Warren in a hilarious part. The comedy is well-written and packs a satirical punch. Everything from the battle of the sexes to gay life in the theatrical world is touched upon, but not in an offensive or even purely stereotypical manner. It may be tame and silly by today's standards but in 1982, it was fresh and witty, and audiences flocked to see Julie Andrews, long seen as the epitome of prim-and-proper feminine grace, in a role that she would not have done at the start of her career in the early 60's- a part which calls for cross-dressing. Sadly, at least for me, I did not see Julie Andrews as a man at any point during her stint as Count Victor. Yes, some gays are as thin as she is in the film and may in fact sing in a high voice but Julie Andrews remains Julie Andrews throughout the film, and it's too hard to believe she is supposed to be a man. The make-up people should have given her a small mustache at least. It appears that in a subtle way, this film is Julie Andrews' way of getting back at the old Hollywood of the early 60's that underestimated her when Warner Bros refused to cast her as Liza Dolittle (Audrey Hepburn got the part) because Julie Andrews was considered unappealing and didn't have the star quality that Hepburn had. But this is a very enjoyable film without being in-your-face and vulgar. It's still a film that ought to be viewed by mature adults as some of the content includes partial nudity and some language may appear offensive to some people. This is Blake Edward's greatest comedy and a radically new role for Julie Andrews.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The coup of the century for Julie Andrews.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love clever, smart, films- which is why this movie appeals to me. It respects the smarts of its audience and speaks to them instead of *down* to them. Whether or not you buy (or approve of) the premise of an openly gay 1930's Paris, there is much broad, warm, and witty comedy to enjoy here. Julie Andrews, one of the biggest movie stars in history, had created something of a paradox after the phenomenal success of 'Mary Poppins' and 'The Sound Of Music-' and wished for many years following to shed her nun/governess image. The tacky 70's sex farce 'S.O.B.' was originally thought to be the film which would do it, but she makes an even more impressive departure here as she essays a classically trained singer who discovers a new kind of independence while playing a gay male female impersonator. She likes the ruse at first, but runs head-on into a dilemma when she falls in love with the very macho James Garner while attempting to maintain the professional deception. In retrospect it seems like an incredible challenge for an actor and Ms. Andrews rises to the challenge, passing with flying colors. And then, of course, there are the numbers: "Le Jazz Hot" is elegant, "The Shady Dame from Seville" is sleek, and my favorite, "Crazy World-" a simple unbroken circular pan with a pin spotlight on a tuxedoed Andrews- is utterly bewitching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps the last of the great musicals. Great songs and production numbers, costumes to die for, and a dream cast all at their career best.Victoria (Julie Andrews), so down and out she is ready to compromise her virtue for a meatball, meets Toddy (Robert Preston), an old queen with a head cold. They hatch a plan to pass Victoria off as a man passing himself off as a woman, and somehow it works. What ensues is a string of delightful Andrews cabarets (and a great number by Warren) and a love interest with James Garner who's never quite sure if he might be falling for a man, or is it a woman?Lesley Ann Warren and Alex Karras round out the cast as part of Garner's entourage. Warren is a show stealer who should have won an Oscar, but everyone in this film is fabulous.Written and directed by Blake Edwards, this is one of his best. Never as popular as it might have been because it dealt openly with homosexuality in the 1980's, it is nonetheless an outstanding film on many levels. I hate the fact that it isn't on DVD. What's up with that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a Drag</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1930s Paris, a woman pretends to be a man so she can get a job as a female impersonator. The premise has potential but there isn't enough material here to sustain a running time of over two hours. While there are a few chuckles, there are far more moments where it just feels like a drag (no pun intended). There is one good musical number, "Le Jazz Hot," and a lot of so-so numbers. Although she tries hard, it's hard to believe that everybody thinks Andrews is a man just because she cut her hair. Preston has a field day as a gay performer, although the character is a tired stereotype. Garner does little more than look bemused and embarrassed and who can blame him? Warren is annoying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That's what homosexuality was like in the 1980ies, folks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is "Tootsie" the other way round. A struggling female singer takes to impersonating a transvestite in order to make ends meet. This way, she doesn't have to impersonate anything and comes across as surprisingly convincing. A butch underworld king falls in love with her and is troubled that he's taken in by what he thinks is a man in drag.Although I personally don't care all that much for stories about gender crossing, Victor Victoria is simply a great film with a number of very impressive and creative varit numbers. Director Blake Edwards used a ca. 1930ies German plot and recreated it around his wife Julie Edwards. He went out of his way to promote homosexuals as not-second-rate human beings, although he softened the original plot where the very masculine King Marchand falls in love with what he thinks is a man in drag -- in the film, King first finds out that Victor is really Victoria before he pursues her.Personally, I found the Toddy character, a middle-aged and very queer- acting man, annoying and somewhat dated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film which is as enjoyable to view today as it was when released nearly 25 years ago. Watching it on our PBS station's weekly airing of classic films, it evoked the image of Paris in the 1930's as well as when it was released almost a quarter century ago. And viewing the principals, it also provides a nostalgic memory of their past presentations. With Blake Edwards at his mid-80's, Julie Andrews 70, Lesley Ann Warren now 60, James Garner nearing 80, and Robert Preston now gone nearly 20 years - it is also a pleasure to view this earlier offering from this cast, and to recall that they had many years' entertaining performances (and Edwards productions) long prior to this film. Lesley Ann Warren played the sex kitten as well as any actress ever, and this picture was no exception - and with a pleasingly humorous bent as well. Andrews, Garner and Preston were all actors who showed unfailing competence and versatility in their careers, always pleasing in whatever roles they undertook. The music here is as enjoyable as it was when the film was originally released, as well. This picture is one which is certain to be as thoroughly-enjoyed a quarter century hence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My mom has been begging me to see this movie as far back as I could remember. Because I do love Julie Andrews, she is one of the most charming and graceful women on the silver screen. Not to mention has a voice that just rolls of the hills. She is amazing. I saw the Birdcage earlier this year and my mom told me that if I enjoyed that, I'd truly enjoy Victor/Victoria.Victoria is a struggling entertainer who can't seem to make it. Not only that, but she's starving and almost out of her house. When she meets another man who just got fired from the place she auditioned, he knows her talents and together they create Victor. An idea to be a woman pretending to be a man who is pretending to be a woman. She does so and is a very successful drag queen. She also falls deep for James Garner, a detective who knows her secret.Victor/Victoria is a terrific film that I would highly recommend. It's a great movie, has a terrific cast, and just the best songs. Not to mention, you'll laugh your head off.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was 15 when this movie was released. I loved it then and I still love this movie now. The movie holds up. In fact its rare but this movie has gotten better with age. The diner scene must be one of the funniest moments ever put on film. This movie was nominated for Best Picture of 1982. Other movies nominated that year were "ET', "Tootsie", " Missing","The Verdict". However V/V lost to Ghandi. Now almost 25 years later what movies do people still love and talk about well its not "Ghandi". The only thing wrong with V/V is that it runs too long. In fact 10 minutes cut of been cut and the plot would not suffer at all. However this is one of might favorite movies of the 1980's. I think if this movie was to be made and released today it would be a huge hit. The movie was ahead of its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Great Movie Musicals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the time Blake Edwards took on directing chores forVICTOR/VICTORIA, his career was slipping badly. The PinkPanther movie franchise has run out of gas. He was a long wayfrom Breakfast at Tiffany's and The Days of Wine and Roses. There was a brief burst of bitterness in S.O.B., but withVICTOR/VICTORIA, Edwards seemed to have regained his footing.I saw the film at a screening in New York, with no expectations andfound myself utterly charmed by this story of a down-on-her-lucksoprano, who hooks up with an aging, but charming gay man anddisguises herself as a man, playing a woman becoming the toastof Paris. The movie was excellently cast with James Garner as thegangster/admirer of Victor/Victoria, Robert Preston a total delightas Toby, the mentor who steers Victor/Victoria to cabaret stardom,Leslie Ann Warren, Garner's vixenish girlfriend/moll, Alex Karrasas Garner's valet/body guard and John Rhys-Davies. Edwardswrote his own screenplay adaptation of the German play. HenryMancini composed the score to lyrics by Leslie Bricusse. Andrews and Preston meet in a restaurant where she's dining outthough she can't afford it. She invites him to join her (he'd alreadywitnessed her failed audition earlier in the day) and tells him she'sgot a live cockroach which she sets loose to screaming andmayhem in order to get the management to rip up the check. Escaping, they form a friendship, and Preston sees an opportunityto launch her as Victor/Victoria. Garner and his girlfriend, are outon the town, visiting Paris from Chicago and take in Andrews'cabaret debut. He finds Victor/Victoria attractive, but when it'srevealed she is a man, he's horrified. The rest of the movie is onecomic and musical set piece after another as Garner isdetermined to prove that Victor is Victoria and his masculinity issafe. Warren is hilarious as the nasty and shrewish girlfriend, andwon an Academy Award nomination as best supporting actress forthe part (and giving her career some steam for a few more years). Preston's skill as a first-rate comic actor make Toby the real star ofthe film. Andrews is beautiful, sings terrifically, and plays her partwith great warmth, in this her final film as a leading lady. She toowon an Oscar nomination for the role. Garner is hilarious as thebefuddled gangster proving once again his worth as one of themost likable movie stars of his era. Edwards is famous for his comic set ups in films and he is at hisloosest and most engaging, making this one of the mostenjoyable and funny movies of his career. Mancini's score islovely. About a year later, I was visiting my family, and dragged my threestraight brothers to see this movie. All of them roared withlaughter. A real crowd pleaser. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first section of this movie is brilliant. But from the moment Julie and Robert move into a posh hotel it's downhill all the way. James Garner and Lesley Anne Warren (particularly) are forced to humiliate themselves. The comedy stalls,and the film starts making plonkingly obvious statements about tolerance ofsexual difference which are very of its time (the 80s). Eg Warren to Preston: maybe you haven't met the right girl yet. Preston to Warren: Maybe YOUhaven't met the right girl yet. Warren's dance routine seems designed to put the viewer off women. Her luring Garner to bed with babytalk seems a straight copy of Jean Harlow in Dinner at Eight, only not so well done.Julie emerging from the wardrobe dressed in a suit and Homburg is excellent,but Liz Fraser did it first in Carry on Regardless (1961). Oh well, the whole film is based on an original from the 30s.If you liked this, try the Jessie Matthews version, First a Girl! xxxxxxxx</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Julie Andrews plays an out of work starving artist. However, when she meets a gay man (Robert Preston), he convinces her to fake being a cross-dresser and then she'll hit it big. This turns out to be true but also creates serious problems in regard to her love life.I read through the many very positive reviews for "Victor Victoria" and felt a bit lost. In some ways I wondered exactly what they saw in this film. I mean that "Victor Victoria" was kind of cute and enjoyable--but not much more. Perhaps the earlier versions would might have been a bit better.Although the film is set in France in the 1930s, you might no know that by listening to everyone. James Garner, Julie Andrews and Robert Preston are the leads....and are not exactly French. No one sounded or looked French. I wonder what French folks think when they see films like this... Also, while I know that the film is about a cross-dressing cabaret singer, I STILL felt that there were too many musical numbers. They tended to slow the film down and deflected the comedy. However, overall it's still an enjoyable little comedy that is a bit better than a time-passer.I know I am the odd reviewer here, but I just didn't see this as a really funny film nor did it seem all that special--especially with it coming out the same time as a better cross-dressing film, "Tootsie".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blake Edwards was a genius! I agree with other reviewers that if you have a problem with THIS movie, then you have issues with your own sexuality that are no one else's problem but your own. I could watch this movie 1000 times (and I think I may have) and still belly laugh all the way through! I've let my kids watch it and all of the 'adult' jokes go right over their heads, like they did mine when I was only 13 (that's how I remember when this movie was released). Blake Edwards, who was not only Julie Andrew's husband but also the director of all the Pink Panther movies, was a brilliant director that more young movie makers should model their craft after. Physical comedy, not necessarily script lines, will always get a huge laugh if filmed properly with proper comedic timing (something that is next-to-impossible to teach). Knowing HOW to shoot a comedy scene is the key to getting those big laughs (watch the cockroach- restaurant scene to the end and note the change in audience perspective; that's what makes that scene a cinematic classic!) Get some popcorn, a glass of good French wine and prepare yourself for an evening of laughs and feel-good entertainment! Great for the whole family...as long as you're not "uptight". Life's too short to go through it uptight anyway so LEARN to be less selfish, LEARN to respect other people's way of thinking (even if it differs from your own beliefs)and LEARN how to be TOLERANT!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie at the age of 12. At the time, I dubbed it the worst film in existance, despite my growing obsession with Julie Andrews. Looking back, I figure I probably hated it so much because I didn't get it. I still confused "homosexual" and "homocidal," for crying out loud! Willing to give it another chance, I watched a DVD of the stage version a few months ago and actually kind of liked it. I'd always liked the music (can't really go wrong with Mancini) and it was actually funny. I found myself laughing quite a bit. I then watched the DVD of the movie, but with commentary done by Julie Andrews and Blake Edwards, the star and director/writer of the movie. They're also husband and wife, which made it really cute. They were very funny talking about the most acclaimed film they made together and I still saw the movie and heard quite a bit of the dialogue. Long story short (I know, too late), it's not the worst movie ever made, it is funny (especially the very end), and the music is still great. Maybe someday I'll even re-watch the movie without the commentary and like it even more--but don't push me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watch Victor/Victoria mainly for Julie Andrews' performance. She is very good (although she's been better elsewhere). If you need a second reason, watch it for Lesley Ann Warren, who is a hoot as the blonde bombshell. A couple of the songs and musical numbers were great (especially Warren's. Yowza!), but I wish there had been more. Most of the rest of the movie doesn't work at all. I laughed a few times, I got bored sometimes. I didn't feel like I had wasted 2 hours and 14 minutes of my life or anything. I did, however, think I could have been watching a better movie. The films that Victor/Victoria reminds me of most are as follows: first and foremost, it felt like a very watered down version of Cabaret. It would be shocking to me if the filmmakers here were not enormously familiar with it. Also, my favorite Blake Edwards movie, the only other one I've seen, actually, is Breakfast at Tiffany's. Victor/Victoria is well directed, but nowhere near BaT. And the newest drag queen musical, Hedwig and the Angry Inch. It's not too similar to this one, but it came up in my mind when I was watching this. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would had been a great hit if it had been released in the '40's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is made exactly in the same way as '40's MGM musicals were made and till some extend also '50's and '60's musicals. It also has some very typical genre story and characters. This style and atmosphere gets all the more strengthened by the fact that the movie is set in the '30's, like many other similar genre movies from the good old days. Blake Edwards really must be a big fan of the genre. But here is also were lies one of the problems of the movie. It's too old fashioned and not refreshing enough, for a late musical made in completely '40's style.Plus the concept of the movie is in my opinion a flawed one because of the simple reason that there is no way that Julie Andrews looks believable enough as a woman who is impersonating a man playing a woman. Are you still with me? She is just way to feminine looking for that, in every regard. Her curves, her face, her arms. It's really not believable that no more people were onto this scam. I mean, this movie just ain't no "Tootsie" or "Mrs. Doubtfire", that handled this concept much better and certainly more credible. But then again, this movie of course also doesn't try to be a credible one. Just an entertaining and silly one instead. The rest of the story is a real typical genre one, that unfortunately is just not the best the genre has ever provided. It's too bad that the movie didn't do more with the homosexual and transvestite themes within the movie. Those themes within the movie now instead feel rather bland and meaningless, while the movie could had really been a relevant one by trying to make a clear statement regarding those themes. It's as if the movie was too afraid now, which makes the story a sort of a restrained one.The comical moments in this movie show that Blake Edwards is the top of his game. It's all so incredibly well timed and executed, in a typical Blake Edwards way. What I love about Blake Edwards comedies, is that the humorous moments are always shot in such an original effective way. There's a camera, there are people in front of it and there is a situation. The moments are always filmed as if they're happening during a stage-play. The camera doesn't move and the movie doesn't have cuts. Just one long shot filled with greatly executed comedy, done by some talented actors and an even more talented man behind the camera's; Blake Edwards. To me it was mostly the comedy that made this movie worthwhile.The movie deliberately doesn't try to impress too much, by having grand sets and spectacular shows, like musical movies that are being made this present day often are being made. I think this movie does that deliberately to be consistent with the musical movies made mostly in the '40's.The movie gets mostly carried by Julie Andrews, who is of course at ease in the musical genre, having already made movies such as "Mary Poppins" and "The Sound of Music". She also plays a real great role in this movie. All of the characters in this movie are really fun one's and portrayed by some good actors, such as Julie Andrews but also James Garner and Robert Preston among others.You'll mostly get a blast out of this movie if you're familiar with the old musical genre, from a time long since gone, even in 1982 already.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

For a Blake Edwards comedy, this is far from his best. Like before, Julie Andrews is a marvel. Her voice, her beauty, and her amazing charm keeps you watching the movie. Without her, this is another quick comedic ride of not so interesting moments that make up another "gay" thrill ride. Although this movie has gay tones, it is not, and should not be considered a Gay movie, let alone a movie for the Gay community. Sure, its a nice comedy that couldn't hold up to any comedy outside the "What's Up Doc" genre of situation after situation that all ends up falling into place with the plot. Sure, they're nice for a quick laugh, but for a serious timeless comedy, it falls short of anything great. By the way, Julie Andrews is fantastic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Blake Edwards production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After finally seeing DARLING LILI on DVD, I was surprised by how familiar the whole disastrous 1970 movie was. Then I realized LILI was just another Blake Edwards film filled with typical Blake Edwards shenanigans, seen so many times in other Blake Edwards films, including VICTOR/VICTORIA.Like DARLING LILI, VICTOR/VICTORIA is a non-musical musical. That is, people don't sing out suddenly and dance and such. All the singing occurs on stage. So we watch people watching a stage show. It makes for a very inert musical. I prefer musicals like MY FAIR LADY or FUNNY FACE, where the characters' singing isn't anchored to one specific area. There's nothing interesting in watching people watching a stage show.Like in DARLING LILI, there's a lot of unfunny slapstick comedy in VICTOR/VICTORIA, some of which are stretched out forever (the whole scene with the cockroach at the restaurant for example). Or the scene where someone is outside Victoria's apartment, trying to see if Victor is actually a man or woman. This scene is identical to the very long and unfunny scene in DARLING LILI, which has two French police officers spying on Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson from a slanted rooftop, while it's raining outside, not snowing like in VV.Like in DARLING LILI, the whole thing takes place in a kitschy version of Paris and yet all the songs are in English. And the production values are too sleek and they just don't jibe with Paris of that era. Why does Blake keep making movies set in France and yet they feel so non-French? Like in DARLING LILI, the romance in VICTOR/VICTORIA is very artificial and forced. Instead of big, square-jawed Rock Hudson in LILI, Julie falls for big, square-jawed James Garner in VV. What a stretch.Like in DARLING LILI, there's a pointless striptease in VICTOR/VICTORIA, which adds nothing to the story. In LILI, it was "Crepe Suzette". In VV, we see Lesley Ann Warren dancing and wiggling her butt and taking her clothes off. Her musical number is horrible. Cats screeching sound better than this musical number.Like in DARLING LILI, there's no pay-off in VICTOR/VICTORIA. We expect some sort of amazing pay-off at the end, after milking the whole "Garner falling in love with Andrews as Victoria only to refuse to believe that Andrews is a man" bit for most of the film, only for what? So that Andrews falls in love with Garner, as woman, and they live happily ever after? I thought the point of Andrews going through all of this charade was for her to have a successful singing career, not live in poverty, etc? Incidentally, for a film that's about gender bending and homosexuality, it's somewhat misogynistic and homophobic. Misogynistic because Andrews loses her sensational job for a man; and it's a tad homophobic with the "Garner falling in love with Andrews as Victoria only to refuse to believe that Andrews is a man" bit is played strictly for laughs. How refreshing it would have been if it hadn't been played entirely just for laughs.And like in DARLING LILI, the 1982 film is way too long and overstays its welcome after a while. Edwards just doesn't know when to end his films. Unlike DARLING LILI though, VICTOR/VICTORIA is not an all out disaster like that ill-conceived 1970 film. It's OK but nothing remarkable and most definitely overrated, from looking at the reviews here. Like I've mentioned above, there's a vivid sense of deja-vu whenever I'm watching a Blake Edwards film, because, you know, he's such a risky director.</fullReview>
