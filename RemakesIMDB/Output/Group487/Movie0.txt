		<shortDescription>As delightful and funny as Victor/Victoria</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was obviously the inspiration for the 1982 film VICTOR/VICTORIA, but that film went off appropriately in the direction that a contemporary film about gender role-playing should go into. They thankfully did not remake this original film, because this film stands on its own as extremely entertaining, and as a fascinating glimpse into the last carefree days of filmmaking in the Weimar Republic. It is an incredible record of its era. Much of the dialogue is spoken in verse (and very cleverly I might add!), and there are musical numbers that make one reflect on both the Busby Berkeley musicals of 1930s Hollywood and of the film CABARET, made decades later. The cast is exemplary. Renate Muller should have been a bigger star than Marlene Dietrich, and it's exciting to see Anton Walbrook looking younger and more dashing than ever. The film doesn't go into the same risque sexual identity antics that VICTOR/VICTORIA went into, but it still provides some amusing turns on gender role-playing, including a hilarious scene where "Viktoria" gets a shave. It is just a pure delight all the way through, and fans of VICTOR/VICTORIA will enjoy making comparisons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irresistible!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What surprised me most about this film, since it's famously the inspiration for the 1982 Blake Edwards/Julie Andrews musical "Victor/Victoria," is that it's so CLEAN. The fact that its release date is 1933 may mean it was produced under Nazi censorship, or on the other hand it might be an example of how innocent and yet sophisticated filmmaking could be in Weimar Berlin. Notably, there's absolutely no homosexuality in it; the Robert Preston character (a wonderful piece of clowning by Hermann Thimig) is straight, and the James Garner guy (the incredibly sexy Anton Walbrook) suspects all along that Viktoria is really female, and his courtship of her consists of teasingly playing up to her pretensions of maleness while tweaking her feminine tendencies. The through-line of this version is the charming reactions of the skittish young Susanna-Viktoria (an endearing performance by Renate Mueller that's a poignant reminder that it's possible for actresses to be both beautiful AND skilled performers--a point usually lost on Hollywood) to the strange and excellent adventures of passing as a man, and then falling in love while trying to pass as a man with the man she loves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun film and a special viewing that bridged generations and cultures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film a number of years ago at a gay film festival at the Tel-Aviv Cinemateque. I knew that it existed -- I think there must have been a credit for it at the end of the Julie Andrews film and just ran to see it while I had the opportunity. The audience seemed to be evenly divided between the gay lesbian community and German/Austrian old timers.Everyone seemed to have a really good time, despite the poor quality of the copy and the lack of Hebrew subtitles. And, it was quite delightful to overhear two elderly ladies talking about how "Mama" wouldn't let them see the movie when it first came out, and here the were seeing it today!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an operetta! who knew?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The startling thing about the original "Victor and Victoria" is its operetta-like form with significant dramatic interactions presented in rhyme, either sung or in recitative. Reinhold Schunzel (who later appeared to outstanding effect in such American films as "Hangmen Also Die" and "Notorious") directs stylishly with sometimes over-obvious flair, milking laughs from the physical comedy of the leads?namely, the energetic Hermann Thimig as the female impersonator who catches cold and persuades an ambitious young performer (Renate Muller) to sub for him. She becomes a huge hit overnight. The dashing Adolf Wohlbruck (later Anton Walbrook of "Red Shoes" fame) is the gentleman who falls in love with her after discovering "he" is a "she." One odd bit: when Wohlbruck takes Muller to a barbershop for a shave and she removes her jacket it is very clear from her anatomy that she is a female, but no one notices. Why then did the filmmakers do nothing to flatten her chest?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>rapturous musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a rapturous musical - with lilting melodies, often sung in rhyming couplets - it is a reminder of how free spirited the German musical was before the Third Reich.I thought the "military" song when they sang that "nothing will stand in their way", "they will triumph and go higher and higher" and "1933 will be our year" was a thinly veiled tribute to Hitler's new regime. The Manager even jokes that "I'm as safe as the Weimer Republic".Renate Muller was Germany's brightest star of the early thirties. She went to England in 1931 to star in "Sunshine Susie" - an English version of her first musical success "Privatsekretarin" (1929). This was her biggest success - in it she played Susanne Lohr, an actress who is hoping for a part that will give her a chance to show off her talents. After being rejected from yet another audition (for being too young -"come back in ten years") she meets up with Viktor Hempel (Herman Thimig) who to make ends meet, moonlights as Viktoria, a female impersonator. When Susi takes his place one night, they become an international success. They go to London (that strangely enough is full of Germans)and they meet the (very, very ) handsome Anton Walbrook and his friends. The scenes where Anton show Susi (still masquerading as Viktor) the town - including going to the barbers for his first shave and having a drink in a very rough tavern are the film's highlights.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remade as First a Girl with Jessie Matthews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many are aware that Viktor and Viktoria was remade in the U.S. as Victor/Victoria, but an English-language remake was made the following year in the U.S. starring Jessie Matthews and Barry McKay. The film follows the German script closely including the scene with the geese, but allows McKay to be in on the impersonation much earlier. Intriguingly, neither the German nor UK version contain a single hint of homosexuality -- female and male impersonation were simply accepted theatrical forms. No nudge-nudge wink-wink. One of the more poignant and droll scenes in the German film is when the ambitious thespians descend several flights of stairs in a seedy theatrical booking building, singing to a joyous martial melody that they will climb ever higher and higher-- as they descend and descend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A woman playing a man playing a woman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Viktor Hempel (Hermann Thimig) has played many parts; one of which is of a woman. He crosses paths with Susanne Lohr (Renate Müller) at an opportune time when he has a cold and can not go on. She goes on in his place and when she reveals herself to be a man by taking a wig off, is an instant success. The story gets complex when she falls for a man and can not tell him that she is a woman. Little does she know he found out. So he has fun leading her on. Will she ever find out that he knows?The movie shows many interesting things about the Weimar era such as an automat. The singing is from the 30's so they have that warble that you heard in Disney's Snow White. And the movie has a lot of slapstick filler. Many times Viktor is unnecessarily a dufus. I have a sparse German vocabulary and am lucky most of the characters spoke slowly or at least used basic statements. There is also a smidgen of English including a song about Spain. The film would have been easer to follow if Deutsch sub-titles were available. The DVD I Watched is region 2 from Black Hill Pictures GmbH. You may need a multiregional player or do a little ripping and converting to play.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The oldest of a quartet of films based on the same story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Viktor und Viktoria" was directed by Reinhold Schünzel and came out at an unusual time period in Germany. Had it come out just a few years later, the Nazi government surely would have labeled it as degenerate and censored it. After all, the plot has a lot of elements of tranvestism and possible homosexuality--subjects the new Reich would never allow in theaters. But, in 1933, the Nazis just came to power and were slowly consolidating their power and were not yet a dictatorship-- so such a movie was released to theaters and was a success. In fact, the director ALSO filmed a French language version--with the same sets but with different leading actors. In fact, the film worked so well that the Brit made their own version, "First a Girl", just two years later--and of the three, I definitely prefer the British remake. And, speaking of remakes, Hollywood remade this decades later as "Victor/Victoria"."Vikor und Viktoria" is a musical--but not in the way the British film was made. Instead of having a lot of kitschy musical numbers (which I loved) like the British film, much of the song consisted of sung dialog. It worked okay--but the lyrics lacked the humor of the British ones. Additionally, the gay aspects of the film were REALLY de-emphasized (perhaps to kiss up to the new Nazi regime)--making Viktor, somehow, more 'butch'.The film begins with Susanne trying unsuccessfully to get a job as a singer. Though she has a lovely job, it doesn't seem to mater. And, after she and Viktor both lose jobs the same day, they meet up and become friends. Unfortunately, soon Viktor loses his voice--and this is a serious problem since he had another interview. So he has an idea-- Susanne should try out in his place. What's the role? He's trying out as a man who dresses and pretends to be a woman---only Susanne now has to pretend to be a man pretending to be a woman! It's all confusing...and rather cute. But, the characters and plot, to me, were missing something. It wasn't only the music, but the British version was just more likable and sweet. This one, in contrast, looked a bit flat. Still, it IS worth seeing--clever and unique for its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Lost Original Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this is a fantastically fun film, particularly as source material for "First a girl" and "Victor/Victoria" later. I disagree with another reviewer who said that the UK version doesn't have any hint of homosexuality in it. One of the characters says to Jessie Mathews (Victor (as a man)) "At first you didn't strike me as the type of man who'd be interested in that sort of thing (meaning marriage) you know, in girls." to which Jessie (Victor) replies "Oh! But I am!" The premise of all three of these films is quite complex and truly funny. A (real) woman falls on hard times and meets a (some-films gay, some-films not) man who shows her how to "work the circuit" and get a meal or two for free, etc.Then, the man, who is by day a gentleman an by night a female impersonator, gets sick and his new friend has to go on in his stead. She does a smashing job, and they are quickly offered a contract they cannot refuse -- now all they have to do is convince the world that out of that dress and that wig, SHE'S really a HE... and calamity ensues.I hope you enjoy! -Rob</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Old Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read all the former reviews I hesitate to openly express my opinion about this movie because it differs so much from all the sensational comments and eulogies previously lavished on it that they make me withdraw in shameful doubts about my powers of judgement.But since I started writing a review I feel obliged to finish it, no matter the consequences. First of all, I must say I don't speak a word of German --Jawohl and two or three other words-- so, right there I'm totally handicapped to dare to judged this film, since the copy I saw didn't have any kind of subtitles.I saw, years ago, the American version with Julie Andrews (A Goddess) Lesley Ann Warren (the funniest Gun Moll in the history of movie making) and that unique, immense actor, Robert Preston (although to be fair with that production EVERYBODY in it was sensational!!) and, more or less, it gave me some hints of what was going on in this 1932 version. But let's consider the acting and the situations at least as a silent movie: The whole thing looks extremely dated, exaggerated gestures, almost circus like acting; a girl --Renate Müller-- so curvaceous that will make her impossible to pass for a boy (Impressive knockers, the one in the middle was her head) an alien way to tell the story, almost unbearable to a contemporary audience, etc.Again, I hate to offend a German audience that maybe delighted just in listening to their mother tongue, no doubt full of exquisite nuances and as several mentioned, spoken in metric verse. I would feel the same if the actors were speaking some of the few languages I command but unfortunately German is not among them.To me it's a very old fashion film that doesn't compare at all with the newer Julie Andrews version and her sensational interpretation. OK, that--that--that's All Folks!</fullReview>
