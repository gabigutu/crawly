		<shortDescription>Is your blood that colour?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People knock this film. Yes it has many flaws but some slack should be cut. It was 1971, Hollywood was in a desperate time of recession and change. 'Easy Rider' had blown a hole in the side of the school of thought that the studios had subscribed to. Suddenly, story material that would never have been tackled by the major studios prior to this time was emerging.'The Omega Man' was of course an adaptation of Matheson's novel and is a second film version of it. But the technical challenges were vast. Find a time of day when L.A.'s deserted? Do me a favor! It's a miracle they got anything decent on film. Yes there are distant cars in the back of that zoom out at the top of the film but these guys didn't have computers did they?Anyway, Heston looks amusingly dated in the role of Neville wearing his safari jacket and skintight tracksuit while he prowls the 'deserted' streets. The thing about Chuck is he just LOOKS like a film star. Just driving a car he grabs your attention. The supporting cast here are less engaging. An afro and 'Hey man' too many perhaps. The writers seemed desperate to tap into 70s pop culture. A sure-fire way to date your film.The camera crew on this film must have gone straight onto 'Quincy' after they'd finished this. It's bizarre. There are dolly moves for no reason whatsoever (when Heston first enters his apartment and later before he discovers the sardine tin), zooms that hit the end stop so hard they almost bounce back and roving pans where you actually feel for the operator while he tries to find where the hell Chuck's car's gone. But this is one of the things that makes 70s cinema so great. The raw elements of film-making are on display. Ron Grainer's score is genius in places and god awful in others. It goes from the brilliant main title theme to the woeful chase music when Heston pursues the leading lady. There's also the typically almost pink-tinted blood. Why couldn't they get blood right back then?'The Omega Man' is an engaging, thought-provoking but very dated piece of cinema. The last image of Heston is immortal even if the film's hair-dos are not. Watch it, enjoy it and cut it some slack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film that can't help but aim too high, "The Omega Man" suffers from the very thing that makes it great. Set in a post-apocalyptic future (for the audience of 1971) the film attempts to show a world populated by a single solitary man. Well, a man and a cult of malcontented zombie/mutant/vampire beings. Robert Neville (Heston) is the lone survivor of a germ war that turned the population of the world into freaks. Based on the amazingly brilliant book "I Am Legend" by Richard Matheson, the film shares most of the qualities of the book, yet excludes the portions that make "Legend" fantastic.The idea of being the last man is intriguing. I used to fantasize about being Neville as a child (probably not the healthiest thing for a kid). Neville has paradise, but with the highest price possible. He can have anything he wants, but no one to share it with. And come night time, he must hide in his fortress away from the angry mob of mutants.The apocalyptic world that makes the first half so captivating is destroyed by the second half's plot device. I won't go into details for those who haven't seen it. However, I will say the film starts to slide downhill from the mid-way point. But the lesser parts can be enjoyed as early 70's camp.Even with its faults, "The Omega Man" is a great Sci-fi movie. It also gives Heston a chance to play his quintessential role of a man at the end of civilization. The film's weaknesses don't ruin the experience entirely. It is a film that myself and my friends talk about to this day despite the fact that most of my friends only saw it once or twice (when forced by me).Related note: I Am Legend was also made into the film "The Last Man on Earth" starring Vincent Price. "Omega Man" is discussed in the first scene of indie-film classic "Slacker."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sci Fi Action At Its Explosive Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This action packed and thought-provoking sci-fi drama has been one of my personal favorites for over 30 years. Charlton Heston found his definitive role here, as the last man on earth, a scientist fighting a single handed battle against hundreds of mutant creatures of the night. On the basic level, this movie has some of the most explosive action I have ever seen. Heston is at his best as a bloodless technocrat, a stone killer, "exterminating" mutants with machine guns, pistols, grenades, and his bare hands, all the time giving off an icy air of detachment. Put Chuck up against Clint Eastwood or Charles Bronson and he definitely holds his own purely as a Seventies action hero. On the other hand, this is also Chuck's best performance as an actor. The fact that he literally has the screen to himself for the first half hour allows him to do things he never did in his "epic star" mode. Watch him buy that used car, making small talk with a rotted corpse. Chuck puts across so much loneliness and yet entirely avoids self- pity, as in "thanks a lot, you cheating bastard." It's a scream to watch the bigger than life Moses dealing with life's everyday hassles, not in reality but in wistful fantasy. Then watch the WOODSTOCK scene in the movie theater. Here's right wing idealist Charlton Heston watching left-wing hippies dance and frolic. Here's the last man on earth watching huge mobs of people crowd up the world that is now empty. The ironies are razor sharp, and Heston just lies back and lets the dialog work for him. "Just to see, just to really realize, that if you have to be afraid to smile at someone, if you have to be afraid to walk down the street, what kind of world is that? Right?" Note well the master's restraint. He doesn't sneer, he puts much more sadness into the lip-reading bit, with a little self-loathing on the side. The dialog and situation are tailor-made for Heston's cold decisive vocal style. It's not hammy stuff, it's Heston giving you the same kind of chill Deniro achieved in TAXI DRIVER. It's the paranoid loner as tragic hero. This cold withdrawn stuff is right down his power alley, and Chuck sends this scene into the upper decks. Once the movie gets started, Heston gets superb assistance from Anthony Zerbe as the religious fanatic Brother Matthias. Zerbe is superb and the commentary on religious fanaticism is even more relevant today than it was thirty years ago. Then there's the sizzling racial subplot, the kill-whitey fanaticism of Brother Zachary striking far too close to home in 1973 but remaining as provocative as ever today. It's disturbing indeed to note the subliminal message of the inter-racial love affair -- the nice white man is happy to take care of the black woman and her children, but only after the assertive black man is dead. A movie that provokes, entertains, and combines scorching social issues with rip-roaring adventure, THE OMEGA MAN is Heston's best. "Nope -- they sure don't make pictures like that any more."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now playing: "The Night Creatures"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of these days soon we will see another remake of Richard Matheson's seminal Horror novella. If we do, I hope the marquee will read: "I Am Legend." This should be done for no other reason than to make it easier for Sci-Fi nerds to argue and champion their personal favorite. But I have this feeling the producers will take the easy way out.Boris Sagal, the veteran television director, who died under the most grisly of circumstances--he walked into a helicopter blade--helms a brilliant adaptation of the book. Sure, they changed the vampires into psychotic albinos. And they also injected a heavy dose of the Seventies counter-culture. But the essential themes resist the tampering by the new screenwriters and remain solid story chestnuts. No one handles a weapon with such verve as Mr. Heston. He fires at random and generally hits something. Always a good approach in this type of movie. I enjoy his conversations with Caesar's bust in his "Honky paradise". The sculptures and paintings on the walls are actual reproductions of the immortals they represent. Also, check out the art work on the back of "Dutch's" jacket. It packs a wallop. Ron Grainer's score is legendary and has a elegiac feel punctuated by strange sounds from obscure instruments. The action scenes rival the best. Catch Heston's despair and loneliness when he jogs by a large office building along side a reflecting pool. Every scene is chock full of memorable lines and quirky bits of business. The bodies of the dead pop up randomly with a wild note on the soundtrack. There is a brief nude scene that for once fits into the plot. A standing ovation is in order for anyone left alive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought-provoking, violent sci-fi story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Omega is the last letter of the Greek alphabet, so the "Omega" Man is a round-a-bout way of saying The "Last" Man. Indeed, this violent science fiction actioner is a remake of a 1964 movie called The Last Man On Earth; in this version Charlton Heston assumes the role played by Vincent Price in the earlier film. It is a depressing - and in many ways thought-provoking - story set in a future where the human population has been wiped out.Robert Neville (Heston) is the only remaining survivor of a worldwide plague, other than a race of vampiric mutants who come out at night. When the plague was first reaching epidemic proportions, numerous scientists were given serums to try - Neville was the one who got the correct serum, but he never managed to get back to HQ in time to report the good news. Most of the world's people went on to be killed by the plague, but those who survived have evolved into light-sensitive mutants. Every day, Neville drives around the empty streets of LA scavenging for food, fuel and useful objects; every night he returns to his ultra high-security house from which he fends off the creepy minions who come out to taunt him and, perhaps, one day kill him. The mutants are led by Matthias (Anthony Zerbe), formerly a TV newsreader, now an anti-technology crusader who encourages his followers to destroy the scientific and technological items they find, as he blames meddling scientists for ultimately decimating the world's population.What's so chilling about The Omega Man is that Neville is gradually shown to be the real "mutant". He is the only man left from the world as it WAS; Zerbe and his mutant hordes are the evolutionary creatures of the world as it IS. Distressing as it is, The Omega Man is saying that in the event of a worldwide catastrophe human life would find a way to prevail, but the remnants of previous human life might need eradicating first. From the sensational opening - in which Heston screeches his car to a halt on an empty street and starts shooting at an unseen being in a skyscraper - to the climax (which is simultaneously happy AND sad), The Omega Man constantly raises questions and manipulates our fears. It has weaknesses - sometimes the metaphors and morals are too heavy-handed; parts of the film are slow-going, with an excess of talk which merely goes over plot details already mentioned; there are dated elements (music, decor, costumes, vehicles, slang speech) which deny the film its topicality over 30 years on. But, in spite of all that, The Omega Man remains a worthwhile sci-fi actioner and another cult flick in the Charlton Heston "shock sci-fi" canon (see also Planet of the Apes '68 and Soylent Green '73).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch this movie once. Give it some time, and then you'll want to watch it again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is personally my favorite film. However, I can understand why this one-time sci-fi/horror flick views more like a comedy today. The film has dated more than other films from '71/72, and with the special effects bar haven risen astronomically since that time there is little hope for the film to grow even older gracefully. And a shirtless, oily, middle-aged, often over-acting Charlton Heston doesn't exactly shout hero or Academy Award. But THE OMEGA MAN has its moments, in particular its unexpected, and unexpectedly touching, finale. Add to that worthwhile ending a legendary Ron Grainer (Dr. Who, The Prisoner) soundtrack and some very quotable dialogue ("Thanks alot, you cheating bastard") and THE OMEGA MAN rounds itself out into a very memorable movie.Unfortunately, Warner Bros. has continually delayed the release of OMEGA MAN on DVD - 4 years now counting. Maybe during the wait someone there will realize the potential this movie has a video game. Our heroic player must track The Family down by day and fend them off by night in a bunkered-up penthouse. Like the DVD, it's wishful thinking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie rocks, right from the opening scene where our hero leaps from his car and sprays mutants with a machine gun, to the final frame where... but enough of that. A great flick, one in a line of Charlton Heston post-apocalyptic movies. If you like this you'll love Soylent Green and, of course, the first two Apes films. Heston's like John Wayne in space. Nobody does it better. In this one disease-ravaged mutants stand in for the hippies- that fixes up society's problem with the riff raff, and Charlton has an inter-racial relationship. So there are mixed messages. Charlton Heston chews the scenery in every frame. Oh well, damn you all to hell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Last Hope of the Earth in an Apocalyptic Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1977, the American scientist and colonel Dr. Robert Neville (Charlton Heston) is the last man on Earth. All the human race died or became mutants due to the use of biological weapons in a war. During the war, Dr. Neville was researching an experimental vaccine, and in a flight to a hospital to use his latest experiment, the pilot of his helicopter died and the helicopter crashed. Dr. Neville used the vaccine on himself and it worked, making him the last survivor of human race. The race of mutants self-calls 'The Family' and is leaded by the fanatic Matthias (Anthony Zerbe) in the middle-ages standards, without the use of any facility of the Twentieth Century. Dr. Neville finds some other survivors and intends to use the anti-corpus of his blood to prepare vaccines for them. The apocalyptic story has a tragic open end.Yesterday I saw this movie maybe for the tenth time. In my opinion, it is one of the best Apocalyptic Sci-Fi movies of the 70's (together with 'Soylent Green'), when the world had the cold war to threaten and the population had a great fear of a biological weapons. In Brazil, 'The Omega Man' has not been released on VHS or DVD, and I have a VHS, recorded from the open Brazilian TV in the 80's, dubbed in Portuguese, with a terrible image, but what else can I do to see this movie if the distributors and the cable TV do not show interest to release it in my country? For persons of other native languages like me, I would like to explain the original title of the movie. In accordance with 'The Heritage Illustrated Dictionary', omega is not only the 24th and final letter in the Greek alphabet, but also means the ending, the last of anything. I hope that Tom Cruise does not spoil this magnificent story, since I heard he had the intention of preparing (or spoiling) a remake. Remake of good movies should be forbidden! My vote is nine.Today (06 September 2006) I have watched "The Omega Man" again, now in the original language.Title (Brazil): 'A Última Esperança da Terra' ('The Last Hope of the Earth')</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall, terrific science-fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In typical rock-em, sock-em Heston style, he battles the bad guys in a not to shabby, but now somewhat dated sci-fi adventure. Still, an excellent movie with a terrific premise, and great plot, as mankind is nearly destroyed by nuclear/biological warfare, and Heston struggles to survive as the last sane man in a diseased and dying world.Flashbacks of events leading to this disaster really make this movie come alive. A little melodrama, however is apparent in the scenes of "the family", and the movie does show its age with the language and color of the 70's culture.I'm not sure how some people may take the ending of this movie. I don't remember any big fuss about it in 1971, so I guess it won't be an issue now. A good movie, with a sad, yet hope-filled happy ending, this film is yet another feather-in-the-cap for Charlton Heston when he was in his sci-fi movie making period (Planet of the Apes, Soylent Green) in his great career, and this particular "social statement" movie of the 70's remains relevant to this day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favourite sci-fi movies with Charlton Heston making credible the whole story for me. Anthony Zerbe is tremendous as the family leader as is the now deceased Lincoln Kilpatrick as Zerbes sidekick. Heston as seemingly the last man on earth brings feeling to the film in some cleverly scripted conversations with himself! In fact the script is punctuated by some great one liners! Quick-paced &amp; tense with good supporting performances from Paul Koslo as "Dutch" &amp; Rosalind Cash as "Lisa" Dated now it is, but still stands the test of time as a truly great 70's sci-fi &amp; if you haven't seen it, then you are in for a treat.

		<fullReview>Chuck Heston is too cool to be the ALPHA MALE, so he becomes the OMEGA MAN!!! Reasons why this film is a masterpiece of apocalyptic sci fi and a damn good promotional for the NRA: SEE: Chuck Heston prowl the streets of Los Angeles in his smooth rides (Lincoln, Mustang, Dodge Weapons Carrier)looking for murderous mutants and decked out in his mod safari jacket, shades and submachine gun! SEE: Chuck bridge the generation gap as he digs Country Joe and the Fish at a private screening of 'Woodstock'!SEE: Chuck in his penthouse suite, wearing a green velvet smoking jacket and ruffled shirt, as he swills whiskey and endures the taunts of the legions of the undead! HEAR: Chuck crack wise as a prisoner of the Luddite zombies, just before he's burnt at the stake! Other priceless scenes worth watching: the zombie who envies Chuck's penthouse as a 'honky paradise' Chuck smirking as a news anchor pontificates about the end of the world, Chuck socializing with bronze statues and putting the moves on mannequins, plenty of gunplay and CHUCK'S RAGE!!! You don't like this flick....maybe Chuck (The Omega Man) will come and beat you up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspirational, hopeful, tragic, brilliant...a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The greatest movie of all time?? Well, probably not, but certainly the most influential on my life back in the mid 70s when I first caught it on British television. Charlton Heston is awesome in his role of Robert Neville, and the musical score is outstanding. The story itself may seem a little dated these days, but its religious analogies stand up well even in today's more effects laden times.SPOILERS: The final sequence, as Neville is brutally killed by the leader of the vampire community Matthias (Anthony Zerbe) came as a genuine shock to me, but its underlying hopefulness for the future at least compensates some way for this. I cried and cried when Neville died. Even now when I watch the film, the bleak feeling which runs as an undercurrent throughout, never ceases to move me with the tragedy of the ending.This was Heston's best, in my opinion even surpassing Planet of the Apes, and many times more entertaining than the dreadful Soylent Green (sorry but I really didn't like that one). I really believe that the films you see when you are between 12 and 16 remain with you forever, because its the most impressionable time of your life. At least it was for me. I love this film, always did, always will. Quite honestly 10 out of 10. Though I may well be the only person who thinks this....lol</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent re-imagining of Matheson's novel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, this film is dated. However, I respectfully submit that Mr &amp; Mrs Corrington (with input from Seltzer, Sagal &amp; Heston) knew that most visions of the far future are going to appear deficient with the passage of time. See "Soylent Green." Accordingly, they set the film in roughly the same time period that Matheson used in "I Am Legend." In the novel, the story covered the period of 1975 to 1979.In this way, the 1971 film is best viewed as a kind of alternative reality for the way American culture was evolving in the turbulent late '60s/early '70s. When so viewed, the film is not only clever, but is really inspired. *** SPOILER ALERT****Matheson's concept was to try to use science fiction to give some credibility to the vampire legend. That had been tried, to a point, in "House of Dracula," when the scientist isolated a microorganism that had "infected" Dracula. Matheson went further and in so doing over-extended the premise. The novel is very poignant in parts. However, its primary problem is that tried to create a kind of moral equivalency between Neville and the vampires. That weakened the strength of the narrative. In the novel Neville drank canned tomato juice, like the vampires drank blood? Parts were just silly: vampire women disrobed to lure Neville outside after dark; the head vampire resembled Oliver Hardy. By the end, Matheson was apparently trying to persuade the reader that the vampires were just an "alternate" form of life, infected with "vampirus," that was just trying to survive and deserved pity. For, in different circumstances, "normal" is relative and Neville became the fearsome legend for the "new breed" of humanity, i.e., he became the new "Dracula." Not so for the 1971 concept; no "relativism" here. The world war to which Matheson only alluded was made explicit. Neville became a high-level military scientist (who better to have access to a potential vaccine?), not Matheson's layman who was trying to teach himself about microbiology.The victims of the virus became vicious, homicidal, collectivistic, anti-technologists, beyond reason and compromise. Colonel Robert Neville, US Army Medical Corps, became the object of their fury. His antagonist: Jonathan Matthias, TV newsman/pundit, adept at influencing an audience. Media Monster. He is the fallen one, who creates the Mansonesque "Family," rejecting all traditional American values. It is the counter-culture. Colonel Neville, by contrast, is the establishment. Hard-drinking, exceedingly well-armed (thank you, NRA!) and not averse to zapping the zombies. However, he is compassionate and enlightened. He falls for an Afro-American woman (the late Rosalind Cash) and tries to help her (Heston also marched for civil rights in the early '60s with Rev. King).By the end, we realize that He is the savior. If we partake of His blood, we will be saved. Christians call that the Eucharist. Ultimately, he sacrifices Himself for the good of humanity, so that the normal world, America, will be re-born. The little girl survivor senses it, He is God, or at least a man chosen to be God's agent on Earth. He is, of course, also a soldier, one who is willing to lay down his life so that others might live. No relativism here.Very nice fusion of ideas, Mr &amp; Mrs Corrington. You took Matheson's basic story and made it much better. Neville became the legend he deserved to become. The Ultimate Hero.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chuck's glory days</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**MINOR spoilers** Along with Soylent Green and the Planet Of The Apes movies, The Omega Man represents Chuck Heston in fine form. This movie continues to influence others even today. The basic story involves Chuck as possibly the last man on earth trying to survive against albino mutants who despise the technology that ravaged the world(and Heston).Let's get one thing nice and sparkling clear: Chuck Heston is a ham. Deal with it. It works unbelievably well in this sci-fi classic for an aging, stubborn badass survivor. Chuck is losing his mind from loneliness and killing mutants day in/day out. He is also a man of science and the only(?) uninfected human left. Anthony Zerbe is great as the preacher/leader of the rotting horde. Rosalind Cash has surprising acting ability, tons of attitude, and thankfully, a complete willingness to be nude or near-nude several times. Although another reviewer said if you squint, she could pass for Pam Grier, they're obviously insane as Pam Grier is stacked, so to speak, whereas Cash could use a sandwich or two.The real appeal besides the interesting, very relevant premise, "spooky" deserted Los Angeles, and pretty daring racial content and dialogue, is...Chuck. Forget the car way in the distance, the makeup/effects are capable. If you want a thought-provoking, sometimes hilarious, action-packed sci-fi movie with great camera work...SEE Chuck run, SEE Chuck shoot lots of people, SEE Chuck grimace, sneer, and bare his huge choppers; SEE Chuck crash multiple vehicles on land AND air, SEE Chuck toss one-liners left and right like grenades, SEE chuck in frilly clothes(briefly), SEE Chuck the Mack, SEE Chuck in a Jesus Christ pose...SEE The Omega Man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now this is a Cool Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlton Heston just has that presence, that arrogant demeanor where he screams at the world that doesn't understand what is going on. Some might think it becomes annoying but it actually works very well in this movie. The Omega Man is actually a unique little look at the world, which here is populated by one man, Charlton Heston. For a Science Fiction movie this movie is pretty deep. He is combating a group of zombies that seek to kill all humans.The zombies think that the human beings and their machines have caused the world to go into disarray and that because of it the humans must be destroyed. While the zombie types are evil they make some sense, after all the reason they were zombies are on account of germ warfare. The movie is surprisingly effective for a movie with a 70s wack-a-dum soundtrack, and manages a lot of thrills the old-fashioned way: through no special effects.Charlton Heston also manages to be an interesting character. He seems to be a man in a bit of a conflict, a military man who has no choice but to defend himself, but also a scientist, an imminently intelligent man who seems weary of all of the fighting. He goes through the streets of Los Angeles with all of the products in all of the stores available to him for free. After all who's left to charge him? He seems a little crazy, and he probably is, after all he has gone years without sex, that would drive a lot of men crazy. The action sequences in this movie are cool. There isn't any karate, no Matrix slow motion, just beating people up, and a cool motorcycle ride through Dodger Stadium, where Heston escapes execution, as does Reggie Jackson, haha. I digress.Germ warfare was something far ahead of it's time. The black and white context of this Science Fiction movie also adds a great dimension to this film. The symbolism of the ending where Heston is essentially crucified saving mankind is appropriate, though some will find it silly. This isn't an Oscar winner but this is a fun little Science Fiction movie that will make you think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the ridiculous plot, this shows what a very strong pair of actors (Heston and Zerbe) and a very visually arresting director (Boris Sagal), and a strong musical talent (Ron Grainer) can do, to say the least of Richard Matheson who is an acknowledged wizard in the field of paranoid science fiction (a particular genre).The film is gut-wrenching on many levels and is one of my top 20 films. Heston does the loner better than any other actor.Grainer, who scored the remarkable score for McGoohan's Prisoner series, is in fine form, with an excellent score.Sagal's visuals are absolutely gripping.Zerbe is the perfect antagonist and shows that his TV persona works perfectly on the silver screen.If you get the movie, turn the lights down and watch it at night.

		<shortDescription>Of it's time, but now relevant again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Omega Man was a product of it's time. It played to Cold War fears of a biological war. In the original story, the plague was never really specified as to where it came from and how-it just kind of happened, however in the 1964 Vincent Price film of the same book, it was hinted at that it was something that escaped from a Eastern bloc country's biological weapons lab but it was only in passing. In The Omega Man, a flashback Heston has, shows us that Russia and China had some kind of escalating border war, and the US is somehow pulled into it. All this is done with a montage of stock footage of bomb tests,missile launches,voice overs warning of "Bacillus carrying warheads!" and bit later, we learn that "Jonathan Matthias" was once a news commentator as things went to Hell, as the plague takes full effect with scenes of overcrowded hospitals, people dropping on the street, and him on TV talking to dead viewers about "Judgement day". The virus, or whatever it was, hits very fast and seemingly kills most people within minutes. Some, however,we learn, it takes longer and they wind up as light sensitive,albino zombies, with the now insane- "Matthias" the guru of at least the Los Angeles area ones, battling Robert Neville, the last plague-free man on the planet. Alive,thanks to an experimental drug that seemed to be the cure,he found in the waning days of civilized society, but because of a helicopter crash, too late for anyone but him. We see him, apparently in 1977, two years after the plague had hit-in Spring, 1975(an old wall calendar and Easter greetings reveal this. The "Easter" reference would not be the film's only "Christ" allegory.)The film has a tremendous Ron Grainer opening score, and positively drips everything 70's-fashions, expressions,cars and including nods to blaxploitation films of the time and managing to portray Heston's Neville as "The Man...on his own"It became a seemingly terribly dated film after the Cold War ended in 1989, (kind of like The Day After became of it's time) and many people chortled at the idea of a biological war. After the Soviet Union collapsed, it was found that those fears were not unfounded-that in fact as a "doomsday" weapon the Soviets had secretly stockpiled massive amounts of Smallpox to create just such a last-ditch situation had they been on the losing side of a WW3 that never fortunately occurred.However, now, with both fears of Avian Flu, and the threat of terrorists gaining some kind of viral agent and unleashing it, the film has a new relevance. A good piece of 70's nostalgia but with a current ring to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True Gonzo Classic,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who saw this growing up has a soft spot in their hearts for it. I've encountered enough people over the course of my 41 yrs who perk up at the mention of it to be aware of its place in a lot of our memories. This has been satirized on the Simpsons, which proves it has embedded itself in the national pop culture consciousness. Anyone who has read the book its based on, the incredible "I am Legend" by Richard Matheson, knows that this film has very little in common with it beyond its initial premise--and even that is not followed too closely. All of the criticisms of THE OMEGA MAN are valid: it is very dated and not at all scary or intense and some of the stunts and special effects are laughably, ludicrously cheesy. The villains--who should have been more terrifying than even Romero's zombies--are just crazed albino hippie Luddites and the last half of the film, once Chuck hooks up with Rosalind Cash and the kiddies, is really a let down. But the scenes that open the film of Heston hefting a cool-looking submachine gun while decked out in Austin Powers-style finery staring in angst at an old calendar or losing his mind for a moment hallucinating the sound of telephones ringing in the deserted city still pack a punch. This was the second movie, after 1959's THE WORLD,THE FLESH, AND THE DEVIL, to successfully pull off the eerie effect of being the last living human being in a huge empty city. Both films established the visual motif of streets filled with blowing waves of newspapers and swirling trash.After years of seeing this on TV -- a guaranteed late September or early October event every year for a few years on the local TV station during my Pacific Northwest childhood in the old Dark Age before cable TV and the videocassette revolution, its nice to see this movie on DVD with a beautiful widescreen transfer. It looks and sounds great. As a child I always liked the music, particularly the "surprise party" theme that plays when the villains make their first appearance. It rocks here in all its xylophone and funky electric organ and horns glory!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Film is vintage Heston, in the same vein as Planet of the Apes, and Soylent Green. Heston is bad ass (as usual). Still, if you're just the type to like movies such as "How to Make an American Quilt," or, "The Princess Diaries," you probably won't like, or "get" this film. Film is only for macho studs who are ready to take on the "family." Heston, to paraphrase Rowdy Roddy Piper (of "They Live" fame), came to chew bubble gum and kick ass. Damn...he's all out of gum.The film is crafted well, with a great score for a B film. I'd get it on CD if I could. Too bad IMDb doesn't list the soundtrack. HINT HINT, IMDb...get the soundtrack listings!!!There are two types of people in this world: those who like Heston/Omega Man, and those that don't. The former group consists of men and heroes - the latter, mere Ethan Hawke apologists and Spice Girl fans. Don't be that guy. Be a real man, enjoy vintage Heston</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my all time favourite movies, starring my favourite actor Charlton Heston, what can I say about this film other than magnificent, it is even more entertaining than Richard Matheson's excellent 'I am Legend' upon which it is based. Some reviewers feel this film to be campy and dated, but I heartily disagree, these reviewers are obviously shallow minded snobs, reared on awful modern cgi nightmares.In the movie Heston delivers a great performance as Robert Neville the last man on earth, talking to himself, hearing phones ringing on the edge of sanity. The action scenes where we see his gun toting avenging angel persona are extremely entertaining, enhanced by Ron Grainer's amazing score, one of the greatest film scores ever recorded in my opinion. Mention must also be made of Anthony Zerbe as the megalomaniac leader of the family Mathias, he delivers great fanatical lines, a totally believable cult leader. If you haven't seen this movie already do yourself a favour and see it instantly!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love those 70's flicks. They really experimented with no-nonesense plotlines, and didn't have the resources to exceedingly engross themselves in needless over-production. This last issue is a big problem with many of today's movies, where your eyes often pop out, but your brain usually falls asleep. Someone here complained about the score. I felt the music was great, it sets the whole tone of the movie. For example, in the fight scenes, it gives you an eerie sense of repetition and fatality that, come to think of it, really is the whole point of the movie. Bottom line, just for the premise alone, it's worth watching. Expect some basic production and a couple of cheesy lines. But this is overly compensated by excellent tension and engrossing plotline.</fullReview>

I didn't see Omega until I was 24, but it was worth the wait.There is so much in this film which makes it memorable for me. Chuck's usual dialogue (no-one says "My God" like Heston), Chuck's teeth, 47-year-old Chuck running a mile in 3 minutes 50 seconds (evil mutants I can accept, but this really is unbelievable!), Chuck nonchalantly playing chess with a bust of Napoleon while Matthias catapults fireballs at his balcony, NRA president Chuck picking off evil zombie mutants with a BIG gun, ex-Moses Chuck dying for our sins in crucifixion pose whilst saving the world etc. etc. Pure hokum, but massively entertaining, and unintentionally hilarious. Anthony Zerbe is brilliant as Matthias.10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cinematography, dialog, plot, all merit a 10. This is one of the best films of the early 70s and its plot is more and more likely as time passes. Heston spent a great deal of time preparing this role and interviewed scientists working on biological warfare (included in DVD extras). Some of the early scenes are the most sublime shots of LA ever filmed. They shot early on Sunday mornings to avoid traffic or noise and what you see is 1971-2 LA emptied of humanity. When one considers the fact that avian flu kills 60 percent of those who catch it, we may soon breach the world foretold by Omega Man and moreover, those who live stand to inherit a renaissance of technology and good fortune. "The Omega Man" is more than a film; it's a good plan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the end of the world with Chuck Heston -- and it's a total groove, baby!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Matheson's terrific novel "I Am Legend" has been twice adapted for the big screen. The first adaptation was "The Last Man on Earth," an unsparingly grim'n'gloomy Italian mid 60's Gothic horror outing starring Vincent Price. "The Omega Man" on the other hand is a lively undead corpse of an altogether separate hue -- and it's one rip-roaringly loud, gaudy, tripped-out funky-a** blinding Day-Glow color at that. Yep, this American made sci-fi/action baby only retains the central premise of Matheson's book, embellishing greatly on the story so it can snazzily cater to all the hip'n'happening trends of the early 70's. The film serves as a wildly distorted and hugely entertaining funhouse mirror reflection of the heady early 70's and nowadays naturally represents a hopelessly dated, yet still oddly charming time capsule of a bygone era.A terrible plague has wiped out most of mankind and turned the bulk of folks who are still alive into crazed albino mutants. Famed NRA spokesman and archetypal post-nuke sci-fi/action survivalist icon par excellence Charlton Heston portrays with his customary steely resolve and firm granite jaw one Robert Neville, an unattached, sardonically wisecracking, rough'n'tumble machine gun-toting bachelor scientist who lives in an eerily empty and desolate Los Angeles along with a lethal bunch of the evil albino mutants. Led by former TV newscaster turned Charles Manson-style cult leader Matthias (deliciously essayed with lip-smacking hammy relish by veteran villainous character actor Anthony Zerbe), the smart, calculating, shades-wearing nocturnal albino mutants call themselves "brother" and "sister," wear cowled black robes which make them resemble deranged monks, use bows and arrows as weapons, and wish to destroy all remnants of modern society so they can create a new technology-free medieval world. These gloriously gaga freaks come across like a marvelously malign cross between the Manson Family and the Black Panthers. Meanwhile our carefree and nonchalant human hero Heston tools around the barren ruins of LA in a fancy convertible while blasting the sappy theme of "A Summer Place" on his 8-track stereo (!), treats himself to countless free showings of "Woodstock," blithely blows away lots of mutants with his trusty machine gun, sips fine wine and plays chess with himself, and has a steamy interracial affair with a spunky black lady survivor (the delightful Rosalind Cash, sporting a jumbo Afro that would make Pam Grier blush). Heston runs across a handful of mellow hippie kids led by motorcycle-riding longhair Paul Koslo who have all somehow managed to avoid being infected by the disease.It gets better. WARNING: Big old nasty *SPOILER* ahead. The film ends on a ridiculous optimistic note with Heston being done in by a spear-tossing Matthias; a serum made from his blood is left behind to cure the survivors. Best of all, Heston croaks with his arms outstretched in a cheesy Jesus Christ on the cross posture, a self-deifying image that's further hammered home by a tacky solarized final freeze frame. The closing visual reveals the entire picture to be nothing more than a silly, thinly veiled Christ allegory. Yep, the basic tone strongly adheres to an extremely conventional and conservative Christian mentality, a giddy upbeat mindset which in turn makes this amazing item an absolute four-star camp hoot of the highest order. The scenes of Heston roaming through the bleak and abandoned city streets are wonderfully bizarre and haunting, highlighted by Heston's extraordinary "the phone isn't ringing" crack-up scene. It's this pervasive straight-faced sense of total inside-out strangeness which gives this fabulously flipped-out film its peculiarly irresistible oddball appeal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A vampiric cult called The Family the result of biological warfare, lay siege to the refuge of the last man left alive in a dead post-apocalyptic city.This is the second cinematic outing for the Richard Matheson novel I Am Legend with Charlton Heston as Robert Neville immune to the plague &amp; fighting for survival. This is an entertaining film if not on a par with some of Hestons other sci-fi movies such as Planet Of The Apes &amp; Soylent Green. Again he gives us an isolated, cynical man who never sets out to be a hero but becomes one.How would you cope as the only man alive? The superior opening act of this movie answers that with the protagonist wandering through a dead city. Constantly reminded of the past with every step along every street &amp; talking to himself, trying to retain his sanity. Indeed one of the best scenes of the whole movie is here when he watches Woodstock in an empty cinema, reciting the dialogue. Just how many times has he done this? Then the film goes down familiar action movie routes with The Family a bizarre religious anti-technology cult &amp; Nevilles attempts to combat their attacks.The Omega Man doesn't have as much depth amongst the action as Planet Of The Apes but has a great &amp; tangible sense of isolation. The Family may not be the most threatening bad guys ever (one of the films flaws) but look good in their cowls &amp; capes, a religious theme which is played out in the wonderful final image at the films climax which offers hope for the future.Overall this film is enjoyable with its slightly comic book sensibilities, good score &amp; strong religious overtones. A good slice of 70s sci-fi fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What we got right here is a prime sampling of Charlton Heston's 1970s renaissance, that's what. Prime Chuck. The Hest. The MAN. In all his ageing, fading glory. From the very beginning we see a sweaty, swarthy and downright bad Chuck rollin' in his five-oh (a la Vanilla Ice, I suppose), scouring the streets of a skeletal near-future Los Angeles. And as the last man on earth, it's the least he can do. Only this is the future with a demonic hitch - Chuck must defend himself at every darkening turn from an evil cult of postwar mutants, led by the maniacal cool-as-ice Matthias. This aggrevated Luddite soul-brother crew's primary aim it seems, is to rid the world of Chuck - while they're not oozing cool and spouting kitschy new-age philosophies. In response, what we as viewers receive is Chuck at his absolute baddest (take that how you wish). In a film where Hest's teeth practically take second billing, we hear him say all the things Chuck was born to say: Damn, bastards, God, SOB and so on.It's one hell of a ride, dated badly from the first moment we see Chuck pop a tape in the 8-Track. Thus, when you feel the need for cheese, simply mix in "The Omega Man" - and a little prime Chuck.</fullReview>

The film has some good suspense and action, but overall, the low-budget and lack of attention to detail (see the other reviewer's comments) turn what could have been a great film into just a good one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A biological warfare wiped out the entire world population and a scientist takes on albino creatures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A post-holocaust caused by a virus, in a germ warfare , has been destroying most of mankind , the plague that causes the end of the world was unleashed as the result of a border war between China and Russia , in fact, China and Russia had some very serious border skirmishes during 1969 that had many world leaders concerned about the possibility of an all-out war between the Communist superpowers an U. S . As an Army scientist named Robert Neville (Charlton Heston) , who had immunized himself, is practically alone in the city of Los Angeles, except for a group of albino-like survivors . He spends time at the local cinema that is offering Woodstock "for the third straight year", this indicates The Omega Man is set in 1977 . Army doctor Robert Neville struggles to create a cure for the plague that wiped out most of the human race . Neville is immune to the effects of a biologically engineered plague and fights those aren't , an army of mutants bent on destroying what's left of the world and constantly harass him . Neville uses a Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) with an Infra-Red scope killing mutants . The pale-skinned men are led by sneering and creepy leaders (Anthony Zerbe, Lincoln Kilpatrick) , they want to eradicate what is left of mankind, but they feel is responsible for the disaster and this, of course, includes Neville. But Neville isn't the sole survivor , early appear a few survivors, an African-American woman named Lisa (Rosalind Cash , though the producer wanted Diahann Carroll for the role).Omega Man's spectacular adaptation with top notch performance by Charlton Heston . Strong intrigue and suspense with considerable violence based on novel by Richard Matheson , which is also the basis for the film ¨The last Man on Earth¨ directed by Sidney Salkow , starred by Vincent Price and a modern version ¨I am legend¨ by Francis Lawrence with Will Smith and Alice Braga . This is a blockbuster production that manages to convey an eerie atmosphere to dismay . The film packs noisy action, tension , thrills , terror and is quite entertaining . Good performance by Charlton ¨Chuck¨ Heston , usual player of spectacular Sci-fi and epic movies . Interesting screenplay by John and Joyce Corrington based on novel "I Am Legend" by Richard Matheson , though he said that The Omega Man was so removed from his book that it didn't even bother him . Atmospheric but rare musical score fitting to action and suspense by Ron Granier . Colorful and glimmer cinematography by Russell Metty . The production company wanted a locale that looked like an abandoned metropolitan area, but it was too costly to build , the producer drove through Downtown Los Angeles one weekend and discovered there were no shoppers, so the majority of the film's exteriors were shot there on weekends. This movie marked the fourth teaming of producer Walter Seltzer with star Charlton Heston who worked together on 1973 ¨Soylent Green¨ , 1972 ¨Skyjacked¨ , 1969 ¨Number one¨ , 1968 ¨Will Penny¨, 1965 ¨The War Lord¨ , they would work together again on ¨The last hard man¨, their seventh and final movie together . The motion picture was professionally directed by Boris Sagal , a television series expert such as ¨Rich man, poor man¨, ¨Ike¨ , ¨Columbo¨, ¨Diary of Anne Frank¨ ,¨Masada¨. Rating : Above average and well worth watching .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>May Omega Never End!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When reviewing a movie, a mistake that many, many people make is not putting it in its proper temporal context, to wit, this movie was made in 1971.As other adept reviewers before me have noted, it is a time capsule of the weird time it was made in. This was the strange cusp between chaos of the 60's and the impending banality/identity crisis of the '70's for American society.So the movie, in its temporal context, was taking some major chances. There are interracial sexual relationships, blatant but appropriate religious imagery and even an overriding and obvious sense of parable. The uncertainties of the world around us IN 1971 is mirrored magnificently in this film (what some call "cheese" or "camp," some of us call defining a time in crystal clear and honest metaphor).Heston, who seems to be an actor who is either totally loved or totally reviled (I'm in the former camp), was Taylor...errr...tailor made...for this role. He IS Colonel Neville. I disagree strongly with those who think his performance was weak here. In fact, I think it was a challenge to play so much time alone on the camera in monologue and to do it without seeming too outre.The gem of this movie however, is Anthony Zerbe as Brother Matthias. I really believe this was one of the best sci-fi villains ever played out on a screen. His control of voice was masterful. One can almost, if they have imagination, let their mind be lulled by his cadenced tones, his subtle intonations, which contrast startingly with his underlying maniacal message. I admit it, even as a teenager, I was secretly rooting for The Family! This movie will appall anyone looking for bigbudget action, or elegant movie-making. It will be a classic and permanent favorite of those who have their own internal time machines and can relive, or experience for the first time, the paranoia, despair and confusion that were rampant betwixt Vietnam, Woodstock (featured in the film I might add!) and Watergate.A classic to those with vision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>nice combo of sci-fi/horror/action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review contains minor spoilers.I was very impressed with The Omega Man, it's an excellent combination of sci-fi, action and horror. Of the three elements surprisingly it is the sci-fi that is the least effective. The plague in the movie isn't very well defined. Sometimes it kills quickly or turns a person into a mutant and slowly kills them but it doesn't explain why this happens. Perhaps it's different levels of immunity within the human race, who knows. Regardless the plague itself could be very scary but it isn't fleshed out as completely as it could have been. This is a small flaw in an otherwise entertaining movie.While not a true horror movie, The Omega Man, contains it's share of creepy locals and suspense. Just the fact that Heston is alone in the city makes otherwise normal locations scary. The placement of dead bodies throughout the movie also adds to the creepiness.The action sequences in the movie are the ones that really impressed me. Some good stunt work and bullets that actually leave a mark on the body help to make the movie ring true. I enjoy post-apocalyptic movies so the sci-fi element works for me. The suspense and creepy locals are enough to keep you on the edge of your seat and the action sequences help to carry the movie along. There is a level of cheese to The Omega Man and it could do with an updating as the attitude of the 70's hasn't aged well but it is still an enjoyable romp. The Omega Man rates a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was a kid in the early 70s, NBC played "The Omega Man" on TV quite a bit. Unfortunately, I had never seen the entire movie, uncut, from beginning to end until I bought the DVD. And I have to say that I enjoyed it just as much as, if not more than, I did when I was a kid.The period in which this film was produced was conducive to movies made with an evident passion. This is a movie with more heart than nearly any big modern studio film you'd care to name. Yes, there are some holes (if I had Neville's arsenal and time, I'd sit on my balcony and snipe The Family until they were no more), but the story (and the music) more than makes up for it. Its flaws aside, this is a powerful story about a man under siege who finds a reason to live, and not just to survive.Certainly there are aspects to the movie that may be off-putting to modern viewers--the early-70s fashions, the too-good in-studio lighting, Neville's insistence on calling his female partner "baby"--but after Beyonce Knowles's "Foxxy Cleopatra," at least Rosalind Cash's "Black Power diva" Lisa is funky fresh again. I am entirely unapologetic about my love for this movie, and yes, the ending still brings tears. The movies I saw during my formative years will always, no matter how good or bad, be special to me, and "The Omega Man" will forever rank as one of my all-time favorite movies, right up there with "Silent Running" and "Voyage Into Space."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still compelling after 30 years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is what I would call a "near-great" movie. Not quite up there in the very top rank, but close. Its portrayal of the last rational man, the "man of science" fighting off the forces of darkness and ignorance in a post-Apocalypse world is both compelling and thought-provoking. In one of his best performances, Charlton Heston carries the first 15 minutes of the movie virtally alone, creating a portrait of a man who has gone just slightly crazy in order to cope with a radically changed world. When his nemesis, played by Anthony Zerbe, finally appears, the contrast between the two men, and the values they represent, is stark. The sequences of Los Angeles as an abandoned ghost town are eerie, as are the scenes of The Family marching through the streets with torches. A great soundtrack score by Ron Grainer, released on CD only last year, adds to the movie's effectiveness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My all-time favorite film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Richard Matheson's " I Am Legend" and a remake of Vincent Price's "The Last Man On Earth", this film is my all-time favorite. "The Omega Man" portrays vividly a post germ warfare world and it's inhabitants who include Robert Neville (Charlton Heston) , a military scientist that manages to vaccinate himself against "The Plague" and a group of psychotic, light sensitive, sub-humans. This group of mutants is led by a man named Matthias (Anthony Zerbe) who convinces his followers that along with the forbidden technology he uses, Neville is responsible for their current physical condition and thus, must pay with his life.I found that the movie manages to stay interesting the whole way through. Particularly interesting are Heston's leisurely drives through a forsaken Los Angeles, his scrounging for food and supplies, and his explorations of buildings in search of Matthias and "The Family". Heston also plays an excellent role, and manages to completely envelop whomever watches the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is one of the best 70's era horror flicks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has roots to another film featuring actor, Vincent Price, "The Last Man on Earth" filmed in b&amp;w. While the Omega Man is in color and features a modernized setting and more dazzling stunts and makeup, much of the quality of the actual acting is overshadowed. Charlton Heston was quoted to say that "Omega Man" was one of his favorite films to work. The cast was more racially diverse which was controversial for much of the South in the 70's. I liked "Omega Man" for it's cutting edge into many fundamental issues about sociology. While astronauts were landing on the moon, people on earth still questioned the significance of human existence in the 1970's. One quick way to judge the value of humanity is to remove it as it is known, and see what is left. Omega Man leaves a viewer with a chilling perspective of human significance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Family" is one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, "The Omega Man" is uniquely entertaining.Germ warfare has ravaged the world, eliminating all life on earth. Parked cars litter the streets, shops remain eternally open, and human corpses bake on the cities sidewalks.However, not all life was eliminated. A scientist named Robert Neville (Charlton Heston) has survived the deadly virus via the experimental vaccine he created. He spends his days driving his convertible through the deserted, sunlit streets of Los Angeles searching for "The Family" - bizarre albino survivors afflicted by the disease, although not entirely dead.Daytime is Neville's time. LA belongs to him, and him alone. He is able to try on new clothes for free, trade cars as often as he pleases and get drunk when the time calls for it. However, come sundown, he must retreat to his fortress as "The Family" awakens at sundown and they outnumber Neville hundreds to one.Led by the brutally intelligent and slightly warped Matthias (Anthony Zerbe), "The Family" don their dark robes and prowl the streets, setting things on fire and trying to kill Neville in the process. In the eyes of Matthias, Neville is a "user of the wheel", "the last of scientists, bankers and doctors" who brought about the end of the world. In Matthias's eyes, he is evil and must be discarded.Sure, this movie may be dated in some ways, but it still a great film. It is very engaging. Nostalgic, even. Don't take it too seriously and you will enjoy it.BTW, watch for the scenes of Charlton Heston talking to himself and playing chess with himself - it really is quite mesmerizing and brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this is a great film, and one of the best sci-fi movies of the 60's/early 70's. Sure, a lot of the movie is dated - (hairstyles, use of the word "honky", etc.), but that is half the fun. And then again, unless a movie was just made, don't most of the classic films look dated? Black and white films from the 40's and 50's certainly do. And most of the best films of all time look dated, so I can't understand some of the negativity regarding this one. To be honest, this story is better told in "The Last Man On Earth", with Vincent Price (see my review on that film), but given the fact that Heston is a bit better actor, and there is a lot more action in this version, I'll have to give this one the nod. When I was a kid, this movie scared the shiit outof me, and to be honest, the family still creeps me out a bit. All in all, great fun, and one of my favorite all time Heston films. A Sci-Fi classic!</fullReview>

Decent directing by Boris Sagal! The movie is made very well and it has some cool action! I like how the people look like druids! It gives the film a scary edge! The music is good. Though how the movie is and some of the things that happened in the film I am surprised that it was rated PG. Another thing I was surprised about was the ending.

		<fullReview>Robert Neville, a doctor,due to an experimental vaccine, is the only survivor of an apocalyptic war waged with biological weapons. The plague caused by the war has killed everyone else except for a few hundred deformed, nocturnal people calling themselves "The Family". The plague has caused them to become sensitive to light, as well as homicidally psychotic. They believe science and technology to be the cause of the war and their punishment, and Neville, as the last symbol of science, the old world, and a "user of the wheel", must die. Neville, using electricity, machinery, and science attempts to hold them at bay.Creepy and good film to I Am Legend with more violence and nudity than you would expect from a PG rated film.Rated PG for Violence, Profanity and Nudity.</fullReview>

I feel the same about the location of Neville's death &amp; the position of his body resembling the crucified Christ because Neville was the mortal savior of the human race.I've seen it probably 50 times so far.

		<fullReview>Very well done, much better than the original with Vincent Price.Some observations:Until I saw the uncut version I never noticed things like working street lights in the opening credits (years after the germ war killed almost everyone), the body lying in the street near the armored car (not decomposed) and the motorcycle guys jacket with the hand on the back with the raised middle finger.Neville's home base was located amongst abandoned buildings up against it on both sides. So, every night, the zombies would try and burn Neville out. So why not just set fire to the houses on both sides and burn the entire block down instead of stupid frontal assaults on Nevilles apartment? I guess being a zombie robs you of 75 IQ points in the process. Ok, so the zombies are stupid, weve established that much! But that does not explain Nevilles actions. Why would he live in a fire trap to begin with? I would have chose an old military base with electrified fences and steel doors to keep out the zombies. Neville could have killed them all in one night. Just set up steel barrels full of explosives, nails, nuts and bolts all over the street and when the zombies came to burn him out, detonate the barrels taking them all out at once instead of hunting them down 1 by 1 (ok, maybe he just enjoyed the thrill of the hunt). Neville could have simply moved to another location so the zombies could not find him at night. It was not like there was any shortage of available housing in the area! Why sit there night after night listening to moaning zombies chanting "Burn! Burn! Neville! Neville!! Burn! Burn!"? Neville was certainly a glutton for punishment.For its logical flaws, it is still a very good movie and very watchable. The chase scene thru the stadium was great.It has been over 30 years, it might be time for an updating of this classic. Maybe Heston could play the role of zombie leader this time. Hopefully they would not screw it up the way they did with the Planet of the Apes remake.</fullReview>

Even so, it's still worth a rent. Whether you think it's scary, funny, unintentionally funny, or just plain weird, you WILL remember Chuck Heston!SPOILERSFavorite scene - the slow reveal of Rosalind Cash removing the towel on her head to reveal white hair - very memorable and VERY creepy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heston.... Cheese.... It Works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people loathe this movie, I love it as a classic, a product of the ambience of that heady time of the late sixties/early seventies. The plot is pretty well known, Heston is the last man (well, almost) on earth fighting against a world overrun by vampires. Well, not vampires, plague survivors with cool sunglasses and a real issue with modern society.The Omega man could have stuck to the original story as a man representing the last of humanity fighting a vain struggle, but then it would have been very grim and essentially a one-man show. Having the hippie kids and Anthony Zerbe leading the bad guys made developing a plot a little easier. Making the Family as a sort of retro-cult rather than vampires was acceptable, and you can't get over the funky early seventies music. This is yet another of the movies that today seems trivial, but seeing it as a child when it was new I found it amazing, especially the scenes of Heston tooling around a completely abandoned Los Angeles. Today it seems more than a little cheesy, but cheese is a healthy part of every movie goer's diet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another one. . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am another one who watched this movie back when I was 12 years old. Back then, it blew me away. And the truth is, the movie has heart, and some neat symbolism, and it has interesting characters, and without a doubt one of Heston's noteworthy roles, and for some, the soundtrack is infectious.I recently watched this with my kids, two boys, aged 12 and 8, and they liked it. The emotional appeal of the main character, his sad plight, the Christian symbolism, and the idea of sacrificing oneself to save the world, all come together in a meaningful way.If you take that away, however, you have a movie that gets a little lost along the way, with some awkward dialogue, histrionic acting, slow plot development, and a general lack of credible tension. The bad guys are, for me, not bad enough, and they suffer from character inconsistencies that are glaring (the mutants in Beneath The Planet of the Apes were far more credible). For example, there is no reason given as to why people stricken with such awful syptoms resist the idea of healing themselves with serum, or why Mathias the only one who doesn't chant in monotones.There are other worthwhile elements, a few excellent touches, especially at the beginning, before Neville meets the others, as when he roams the city and watches old movies. The end sequence is tense, but the internal logic of the film was never attended to, never worked out, and so the middle sags, which is too bad.In the end, as a piece of retro fun on a slow evening with some popcorn, this one is a good fit with the Apes movies from the same era, among others.TB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It takes a generous movie star to share the screen with then-newcomer Anthony Zerbe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film as a teenager, when it was a first-run feature in 1971. In this context, I didn't find it dated at all, and I thought Charlton Heston was a tragic hero, Jesus Christ with pectorals. I saw the film 25 years later, on television. It held up about as well as Mr. Heston's pectorals, which is to say that it's imperfect, but still has more substance than some other pectorals from that time.**possible spoilers** The Christ imagery is hard to miss by the final frame, but the film also used the images of communion and transubstantiation as Heston's blood becomes a symbol of hope for the future. The sharing of blood as salvation--a very powerful image much loved in science fiction. (It was only years later that I noticed the crypto-racism of the last great white man on earth saving the blacks, children, and hippies by giving the gift of his pure Christian blood.)As much as I had a crush on Heston from Planet of the Apes, I think Anthony Zerbe really walked away with this film. Charlton had the chiselled looks, the noble grimace, and the powerful hardware, but it was the unprepossessing Zerbe that elevated this film to something special. He was charismatic and intense as Mathias, Heston's nemesis; in spite of his embarassing makeup and sunglasses, he was a pure force of power, a complex mutant with traces of his humanity still intact. A brief scene of Zerbe, pre-plague, gives the audience a hint of the transformation his character has undergone by the time he becomes the leader of the mutants.**spoilers** I could believe in a relationship between Mathias and Neville more convincingly than I could between Heston and Rosalind Cash, probably because Zerbe was more passionate. Years later, I forgot the shoot-em-ups and flaming bodies, but I remembered Mathias bidding a rueful goodbye to his nemesis after the final battle. I think this film really launched Zerbe's career, at least in television.Of course the racism, sexism, and dumb-headedness are still there. Eg. Rosalind Cash's ready availability--was she really that horny? I guess she was just waiting for a real man to come along. Oh well, enough about this stuff; it's how this action movie got made in 1971.Besides Zerbe, the thing I remember most about this film is a small touch at the beginning. The last normal man on earth risks his life to go to the downtown movie theater, where he sits alone in the dark to watch a film. What does Neville choose? Woodstock! Even this early in the film, we know that Heston's character is anything but an old hippie. So why Woodstock? As Heston sits alone in the deserted theater, we feel his existential loneliness as he absorbs the images of happy, attractive young people spontaneously enjoying the legendary "tribal" gathering. A great scene that almost redeems the rest of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. A friend of mine talked me into seeing this and I thought, "Charlton Heston? The worst actor ever? Oh no!" I went along anyway and really got into the movie. I didn't regret it. This movie was one of the most symbol-dense films I have ever seen. It was a huge twist on the story of Christ as redeemer of man. As I watched I thought, "What a courageous film! A little cheesy, yes, but courageous!"Heston plays a doctor who survives the effects of a global biological war by administering a vaccine to himself. Almost the entire human race is wiped out by the man-made plagues and he is left alone to seek others who may have made it through. Those who survive without the vaccine devolve into nocturnal, superstitious religious fanatic Luddites who seek to destroy Heston because he symbolizes the technologically savvy scientist type that caused all the trouble in the first place. They are led by the charismatic ex-TV commentator Matthias. His battles with these "people" are interesting.Religious symbolism abounds: Heston is obviously supposed to be a combination messiah/ubermensch. Heston is the technological messiah saving the world from ignorance and superstition. His blood, being a serum, will literally save the world, as Christians believe Christ's did. Heston dwells in light; the nocturns dwell in darkness. Heston's apartment belies a love of things pagan. Heston has a spear thrust through his side. The shot at end of the movie caps this especially well. Throughout The Omega Man you sense a greater truth deep and dark: the superstitious always outnumber the rational and will destroy them if they can. A great,great movie. Especially recommended to atheists, agnostics and skeptics. See it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the opening credits finish, Charton Heston (as Neville) loses control of his vehicle, missing an armored truck and after slamming into the curb, he finds out that he has a flat tire. In this sequence, if you look in the background (preferably on a large screen TV) you will notice a person dashing across an alley! So much for being alone and "safe" in the daylight! Another error is in the opening scenes where he drives through downtown L.A., is that if you look into the windows of some of the stores that there is power still on (two years) after the apocalypse! Also, if you notice that since L.A. is a desert city, why is there water around the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion (when Charlton Heston is running his sub-four minute mile) when there should not be any such reservoir in existence! Still, this is one movie that should have been great, instead of merely being good. I hope that someone can remake this film (using more of Richard Matheson's great and classic novel, I Am Legend) instead of leaving a fascinating idea remain cinematically unfinished.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>O Yes They're Playing His Song: I will Survive Or One Is the Lonliest Number</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen The Omega Man quite a few times but recently watched it yet again. I found myself liking it more than I ever did before. Was it the fact that I was feeling nostalgic or does the film really stand some test of time? I am more inclined to go with the second choice. I watched through and was impressed with Heston's acting - always found him to be a good actor. I was impressed with the attention to detail by Boris Sagal the director. I thought how a film like this must have been a nightmare to make back then. They used Los Angeles as the desolate setting for an apocalyptic novel about one man surviving some kind of germ warfare. At night you had some mutant survivors try and kill him. The city then in the day shots must be barren of humans and their collective presence. This film gives us this most impressively with not one micro-atom of help from the computer. The script is the only problem I have ever had with the film. The Omega Man is another adaptation of that wonderful science fiction novel I Am Legend by Richard Matheson. The first version was the Italian film with Vincent Price called The Last Man on Earth. Though I have always felt - and still do - that that film is a better film, The Omega Man has much to offer and maybe its script is growing on me as I age and seem to be more preoccupied with the stuff of anxieties more. In fact the first half of this film is quite excellent as Heston shows us what a day in his life is like. We feel his loneliness, his pain, his strength to survive. We vicariously race down emptied streets, throw away cars and clothes in this consumer heaven, watch a movie seen more time than would like to be counted, and play chess with a bust of Julius Caesar. Definitely not the kind of bust Heston wants to make moves on! Night brings dangers and the film gets a bit melodramatic in some spots here, and the music, the lingo, the attitudes are 100% seventies/late sixties, but all that, for me at least, add to the film rather than detract. Sure some of The Omega Man is cheesy. Some of the script is lacking. The second half of the film isn't always quite sure where it is going or want it wants to achieve. These are credible arguments, but the first half of the film is outstanding, the direction is crisp and taut, and Charlton Heston shows why=he is an actor's actor giving a fine performance basically acting off himself throughout much of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very well made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Omega Man is the second film version of Richard Matheson'snovel I am Legend, the first being a low budget Vincent Price vehicle. Whereas the first version was true to the book, Boris Sagal's version is simply loosely based on the novel. A couple of concepts were changed such as the antagonists no longer being vampires but zombie-like victims of biological warfare. Vampires in 1972 were really no longer a concept for horror films. The other reason is that Neville had to be a morally ambiguous character. In the book it turns out in the end that really he was the monster or that fighting monsters turned him into a monster. Neville in The Omega Man is an officer who was actively involved in developing biological warfare and so his personal hell seems to be a fitting punishment. The film is very much about innocence vs. experience. Neville remains in the city and kills his oponents in meaningless fights because tha's all there is left in his life. His life is validated by having an oponent- an almost Kafkaesque concept. So naturally, when he meets a group of survivors they are children. Some critics thought that his was a document about American fixation youth and being young. In fact, they plan to go t "a new Eden" but there is no place for Neville, because he is -as one boy puts it- hostile. So although in the end we see him as crucified (and more or less resurected through his blood) he is more like Virgil who lead Dante to the gates of paradise but was not allowed to enter himself. The film is very well written in terms of creating sympathy for Neville and then bit by bit deconstructing his character. Neville is very complex, a scientist, a ruthless killer and yet a man who recites poetry and loves art. Heston gives an overall fine performance. There is one beautiful scene where Heston plays chess against a bust of Caesar and you really wonder if he is aware of the fact that he is playing both sides. Visually the film is very well made: In the first 9 minutes we just watch Neville driving through LA and as a prime example of showing vs. telling without any dialogue we begin to understand what has happened so that the following flashback really is unnecessary and relatively crude for such a well made and well written film. In spite of the technical limitations of the early 70s Sagal manages to create a feel of emptiness about LA that is masterfully executed. On the other hand the film does have some incredible holes in the logic and some continuity bloopers. But all in all I would say that The Omega Man is a highly underrated film which works both as an action film and as a statement on the human condition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If I were the Last Man on Earth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the three films that have been explicitly drawn from Matheson's heady pulp sci-fi story "Last Man on Earth" Boris Sagal's The Omega Man is probably the most well-respected. While it is not as lavishly produced as Lawrence's (2007) I am Legend, nor as creepified as Ubaldo Ragona's Last Man on Earth, it is a nice example of a sci fi adventure film with a soul and a brain. Doctor Robert Neville (Charlton Heston) has survived an engineered plague which has wiped out most of the earth's human population. Neville developed a cure as the plague erupted, but was unable to get it into production due to a very unfortunate accident. He injected himself, and is now immune. Every night, he is hunted by vampire-like plague victims lead by the puritanical Luddite fanatic Matthias. Matthias and his followers view the plague as the salvation and rebirth of humanity and see their former lives as evil. Neville is the embodiment of everything they despise. Neville, in the meantime, is desperately pursuing survival and trying to re-create the cure. Then one day, Neville encounters a young black woman (Rosalind Cash) posing as a mannequin in a department store. Omega Man is not a sci-fi spectacular. There really are no special effects to speak of and the director, very appropriately, went to great lengths to make it clear that the story takes place today - not in some distant future. The film was made by a director whose career staple was 'made for TV' movies. Unsurprisingly, Omega Man is economically directed - and its thrift sometimes shows. The cinematography is effective, but some of the action scenes are unconvincingly shot. The cast is excellent - Cash and Heston are especially strong. Remarkably, Omega Man creates an abandoned Los Angeles in 1971 with no special effects - almost as effectively as "I am Legend" did in 2007. It is worth mentioning that I am Legend is estimated to have enjoyed a budget at least 10 times as great as Omega Man's.Omega Man is a good example of the semi-experimental tangents of late 1960s/early 1970s Hollywood film-making. Influenced by the cold war, nuclear proliferation, Viet Nam, and the burgeoning Western counter-culture, films like 2001: A Space Oddyssey, Silent Running, Rollerball and Omega Man - and even the original Star Trek series - stand out as landmarks in the usually intellectually barren landscape of mainstream sci fi.

		<shortDescription>An Awesome Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my favorite books of all time is Richard Matheson's post-apocalyptic thriller I Am Legend. This is a great adaptation of the story. My favorite version is still The Last Man on Earth but this one is good and much better than the horrible Will Smith adaptation. I really enjoyed this movie and I think most fans of the novel will too.The story is definitely much different from the novel and the original movie but it's very fun. Charlton Heston plays scientist Robert Neville and is similar to Price's character but this time he has guns! It moves very fast and keeps the viewer in suspense for the whole movie. Some scenes are a little unnecessary and almost silly but it didn't take much away for me. The music, editing and effects are all fantastic in this one. The direction is also grand. Oh hell, this whole movie is awesome.Fans of the novel and of horror films will both enjoy this movie. Don't mess with the Heston!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great 70s scifi flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very clever adaptation of the novel 'I Am Legend' by Richard Matheson. Even the film's title shows some of the thought that has gone in to it - Omega is the last letter of the Greek alphabet, so the 'Omega' Man is a clever way of saying The 'Last' Man.Many comparisons are now being made between Will Smith's 'I Am Legend' and 'The Omega Man'. For me 'The Omega Man', even with its faults and the fact it is now nearly 40 years old, still stands above Will Smith's new version. Why? (1) The plot - The Omega Man to me is a far better more rounded and believable story. Especially the ending. (2) Acting - Charlton Heston seems far more viable in the role. (3) The creatures/infected - In Will Smith's version, they are obviously just over the top CGI and behave very unrealistically.Of course there are problems with the film, but putting these aside we have what I believe is a great 70s cult scifi film, which the more recent 'I Am Legend' fails to match in most ways. When will Hollywood learn just throwing money at a project (and its effects) is less important than the script and its portrayal. Or more importantly, when will the ticket buying audience...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After the Aftermath</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this at age 15 during its first run in Pittsburgh. I knew nothing of the book or the prior Vincent Price film. I recall thinking it plodding in places, wordy or hyperactive when it shouldn't have been, inconsistently symbolic and too much a product of the times I was still trying to make sense of. But some imagery survived, as did Matthias's passion, Richie's undoing, the musical score and Coulter Counter, and that closing shot.Fast Forward 37 Years: On second viewing this is one creepy little flick. Certainly more dated in places (mark March 1975 on your calendars) but likely scores to this day because it doesn't follow the book and displays no CGI. Solidly crafted, purposely paced, and, given a script that compels you to suspend your disbelief, good acting all around.This Neville is a self-deprecating wheeze too used to being in charge and on the verge of a justifiable breakdown. When he sticks to that characterization Charlton Heston is something of a revelation, though his love scenes with Rosalind Cash just don't quite ring (and perhaps that's the point). Anthony Zerbe still hits home. And listen closely for Dutch's accent.Fans of Paddy McGoohan's The Prisoner should recognize Ron Grainer's score in places and the "jeeplet" Heston squeezes out of and back into. The screenwriters apply their combined backgrounds in English literature and poetry, law, and chemistry (study their other credits). You soon understand The Family better than you expect to. Their catapult tosses a dud, but the shot stays in, while the closing shot is telegraphed at least three times.In sum, it could be better but it could also be insufferably worse. Give it a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What about the Script?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I studied with John Corrington at Loyola in the Sixties. He was a brilliant poet and novelist, and his screen play for the Omega Man makes the movie stand out, along with the excellent acting. The combination of poetic symbolism and the excellent story line made the movie a classic, in my opinion. The current Hollywood version of the story uses the "I Am Legend" title, and has modern digital effects, but the plot line is much less developed, and the characterizations are shallow. If you liked the screenplay in The Omega Man, check out some of Corrington's novels and poems. I agree that there was a lot of Seventies counter-cultural references; but, we were ALL experimenting the Seventies, weren't we? The metaphoric use of the Christ like Neville on a cross at the end was quintessential Corrington.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 70's classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am Legend was a novel about a man named Neville who became the Last Man On Earth after a mysterious plague wiped all of mankind out, he soon discovers that he isn't the Last Man on Earth since some of people aren't dead but instead a race of Vampires and the leader of them was Neville's neighbour. In 1964 I am Legend was adapted into a film using the title The Last Man on Earth which starred legendary horror icon Vincent Price. Then in 1971 I am Legend was adapted into another film this time called The Omega Man, it had the concept of a last man on earth but changed the creatures from Vampires to Albino mutants called The Family, and instead of Neville's neighbour being his tormentor it's a reporter named Matthias who wants to destroy all technology other the centuries to creature a new society. I am Legend is being made into a new film this time using the title from the book and starring Will Smith.The Omega Man sees Robert Neville being the Last Man on Earth for sometime now, at day he searches for people who may be alive while also looking for clothes, gas and The Family. At night Neville has to return to his home which is now a heavily built fortress because The Family always come out at night waiting to get Neville. One day Neville finds a survivor but she gets away and soon he gets captured by The Family but manages to escape thanks to the help of some survivors, they take him to their hideout where they ask for his help to create an antidote to stop the virus since Neville's body is immune to it, so at his home Neville tries to create an antidote using his blood but he has to be quick because The Family are becoming more persistent and will stop at nothing until they have killed Neville and destroyed all technology to create a new world.The Omega Man is a chilling view of what could happen, it's a great film that should be seen. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flaws...yes, but still a fantastic movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, lets get the flaws of this movie out first, just to get it over with. Dated costumes hair and music of the early 70's? Yes. Chuck Hestons performs a little over the top? At times. (But hey, he is Chuck Heston!) Finally, and this is a personal pet peeve of mine about The Omega Man, the last third of the movie felt kinda rushed. Don't get me wrong when Nevelle comes home and finds the family in his house and that lisa has subcumbed to the virus it was bone chilling. But From the time Richie is cured up to that last scene it just felt a little to convenient. But hey as i said it is just a personal beef.That been said. This movie is Fantastic! The cast of Chuck Heston, Rosaland Cash, Paul Kalso were in top form. To me the greatest character was Brother Mathias, Played to creepy perfection by Anthony Zerbe. He's dialoge was both deranged but oddly prophetic. For example when the family first catches Neville and they interrogate him he definitely says that he is a scientist. Mathias says in a quick and stinging retort "Definition of a scientist, A man that understood nothing, till there was nothing left to understand!". Wheew! That is some deep thoughts for a homicidal Lunitic.The best cinematography in the film has got to be the deserted Los Angeles that Neville motors through during the day. The empty streets and occasional rotting corpse really make you feel the loneliness and isolation of the character. The first half of the film to me was the best, Although I did enjoy the second half up to a point, but it did end very strong. I think my favorite scence in the whole movie is when Neville goes to the empty movie theatre and watches, of all things for not only Nevelle but Heston himself to watch, Woodstock. Seeing all the countless number of people together for love and peace and knowing that Nevelle is looking at something gone perhaps forever is very very moving.9 out of 10. I love this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 70s years and the things that may come</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The late 60s and more the 70s years of the 20th century gives us a lot of movies with an apocalyptic background-story, for example "Planet of Apes", "The Andromeda Strain","Soylent Green" or "Silent Runnning". For some viewers of today they may looking cheesy, but they are all children of his time (try to imagine how cheesy "The Matrix" may look in 2030 :-) and they often don't set only on good action-scenes and special effects. Many of them have a background-story to think about it, because the 70s was the time, when people all over the world starts to get aware about our environment and nature, biological warfare and the possibility of the self-destruction of our culture or complete race. So the main question of many of these movies was: In what will our behavior result in the worst case?"The Omega Man" is another of this "apocalyptic movies" of the 70s, and a very well made too. It focus on biological warfare and the results of it. Only one man had survived of our "old world", some others, "the family" are infected by the germs and condemned to die sooner or later, but before they die, they tried to destroy the last symbol of our old, technological world. They constructed their own logic to explain the circumstances and that the infection is a punishment for the errors that mankind made. And so did the almost dead "old world" and the already dying "new world" of "the family" fight the last struggle on earth. This movie is very worthy to see even today, in spite that we did not kill ourself in 1975. See it today as a alternate reality of a parallel universe, maybe it happened so for another earth in another universe and let us hope that our world in our universe will not end with a similar fate.</fullReview>

It features his melodramatic acting at its best. His character seethes with the Heston attitude and the entire film benefits from that. Besides the fact of Heston's presence, the plot is original, the acting above-average for a movie of this type and age, and directing and effects are more than satisfactory. The final scene of the movie, depicting Charlton in a Jesus Christ pose is unforgettable, and the allegory is not lost upon the audience. This movie is pure genius, though the purists will undoubtedly be naysayers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Sci-Fi cult drama of the beginning of the 70's, "The Omega Man" (98 minutes), was directed by Boris Sagal based on the novel "I Am Legend", of Richard Matheson. Charlton Heston is Robert Neville, a military scientist who developed an experimental vaccine in time to save himself of the devastating and apocalyptic biological war between China and Soviet Union. Living a boring and lonely routine, Neville has been in a bunker for three years in a ruined Los Angeles, and spends his time searching for food and armaments to fight the members of the "Family", some hundreds of survivors of the holocaust that had become albinos mutants and psychotic homicides. The group follows the rules, with a religious fervor, of the leader Matthias (the actor Anthony Zerbe), that before the catastrophe was a popular TV presenter. They now want to destroy Neville at any cost because they consider him pernicious, as a symbol of the science and technology that destroyed the humanity and transformed them into a group of dead-livings creatures. The soundtrack is of Ron Grainer and the film is unforgettable...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, gritty, violent tale of the future where only one man is immune</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Omega Man has become a cult classic. A dreary and dark, violent vision of a future where a plague has wiped out mankind and anyone who hasn't been wiped out has been transformed to a creature of the night...blinded by light, albino, with fits of rage and hallucinations. The Omega Man works because it makes you feel like you are truly there with the last man on the planet. It draws you into the main characters world and makes you fear the dark and gives you that feeling of isolation of having no one or nothing left you knew or cared about. If the film were made nowadays the budget would have been astronomical, hundreds of millions of dollars and it would have been serialized with at least one sequel. I'm almost disappointed that more weren't made to tell the story of this world that we once knew.Charlton Heston takes the lead role as The Omega Man. Although figuratively speaking he isn't the "last man on Earth," he is the last man with no side effects or hint of the plague having injected himself with a serum moments before the plague broke. I admit that despite Heston's legendary status, and macho persona I have never been a fan. It's not his films but instead his ego. The man drips with egotism. In one line in The Omega Man he comments "I'm a Narcissist" and truer words have never been spoken. If you are a Heston fan or can move past his sanctimonious performance than he does well playing a role he become quite comfortable with. Science Fiction, leading man, Saviour of biblical proportions. The script is really well done so that we spend nearly the first half of the film becoming intimately familiar with Heston's existence with nothing or no one before we really get introduced to the meat of the film. Heston definitely has presence and is no stranger to being the lead man so this is his kind of film. Anthony Zerbe plays the dark and mysterious Matthias, leader of "The Family," a group of humans poisoned and changed by the plague. I would have really liked Zerbe and his character to have an even bigger role. I think he was capable of being a terrific bad guy, one of the best but his role was slightly minimized. He also never gets his just end which would normally hint towards sequel. In fact it's almost like he wins the battle against Heston's character Neville. Rosalind Cash plays Heston's love interest Lisa. Lisa shows up out of nowhere one day and eventually their mutual exclusion from anyone else brings the couple together. Cash definitely targeted and played upon the huge popularity of the Black Rights Movement in the early seventies. Being a leading lady, and being romantically involved with a white man where it wasn't even suggested at being an issue was really something. The two of them have decent chemistry and she has great personality. She's a fiery leading lady. Paul Koslo plays a small role which I wish had been bigger as well, as Dutch. If the film had been serialized Koslo could have been the focus of the next film. He was a med student, scientist of sorts, a fighter very much like Heston's character. He could have been utilized more but he does play an important role and does it well.Mostly a TV Director Boris Sagal (father of Married With Children's Katey) does a great job of properly utilized the 1 1/2 hour time frame. A Sc-Fi film like this could have went on far longer and covered more ground and I definitely think that wouldn't have been so bad but with the small time frame, and probably very small budget Sagal did a great job. He still manages to make you feel the severity of the situation, feel the emptiness of the world, also give you that fantasy element of what would you do if you were the only man alive on earth? Heston gets what he wants, when he wants it, sees a film, has everything he could possibly need from art to food to weapons but all is not perfect by any means. The only problem with the short story is that some of the characters who desperately could have been explored far more get left behind either in the sake of the story or Heston's character. I would love to see a WELL DONE remake of this for nowadays. Still for Sci-fi fans, Heston fans, or seventies fans this is something else to check out. Great special effects, violent, dark, a little campy at certain moments which could come from it simply being a seventies film who knows?? I will make comments that certainly Heston's opinions about gun rights and advocacy shine through. He is almost never without his trusty WWII machine gun or a host of other weapons and it's made quite clear they are his survival. On top that of that the last scene in the film could be considered a near act of sacrilege as Heston dies crucifixion like passing his blood off to save the world. More Ego perhaps?? At one moment in the film a little girl asks Heston if he is God to which he doesn't respond. Some very, very interesting shots and film images to watch out for. I think there is absolutely some important messages buried beneath this film, plenty to critique and talk about and that makes it an intelligent film that is even...if not more so...relevant today. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** WARNING: SPOILER!!! ***Chinese biological warfare agents are accidentally dispersed over the United States during a Sino-Soviet border war. This biowar agent splits the population into two classes: the dead, and the slowly dying, some of whom become night-dwelling, albino, psychopathic legalists ("the Family") bent an destroying all vestiges of technology. And then there is Robert Neville (Charleton Heston), who is immune thanks to a vaccine that came along too late.At night, the Family tries to dislodge Neville from his well-lit fortress; and during the day, Neville tries to find "the hive" where the Family is holed up. In the course of his search he discovers that there are others alive who have not yet succumbed to the inevitable "Family" stage of the plague.The young brother (Richie) of Neville's love interest (Lisa) begins degrading into the final stage of the plague, and Neville is able to reverse it by transfusing the plague antibodies from his own blood into Richie. Richie later attempts to take the good news of the cure to the Family, and is murdered for it. While Neville is out (after dark) trying to rescue Richie, Lisa changes over, and is drawn into the darkness by the siren-like voice of the Family's leader, Matthias. Neville is betrayed by Lisa, who has succumbed to the darkness and has been beguiled by Matthias. Neville and Matthias engage in a verbal tug-of-war over Lisa, with Neville pleading 'Lisa, for God's sake come back into the light.' Matthias hurls a spear at Neville, striking him in the center of the chest. He pulls the spear out, but is obviously mortally wounded. He falls into a fountain in front of his residence, where he is found shortly after sunrise by the others who have not yet succumbed, but are utterly dependent on Neville for his blood's antibodies to save them from the plague. As his dying act, Neville hands the bottle of serum he made to Dutch, the leader of the remnant, but he fumbles and drops it. Dutch grasps for it, but it falls in the bloody water in the fountain. With great relief Dutch recovers the bottle unbroken and holds it up, looking at the others (many of whom are children) who will be saved by the antibodies.Dutch and the remnant leave, and the credits roll on the image of the now-dead Neville. He is lying in a fountain filled with blood, arms flailed out to his side, head bowed, knees bent, ankles crossed, in what appears to be a very deliberate allusion to the crucified Christ.The scene in which the little girl asks Neville 'are you God?' plays out a little corny, but was probably intended as a foreshadowing of the messianic allegory that Neville would fulfill at the end. That end is one man, who is curiously immune from a plague that universally condemns all humanity to darkness and death, provides by his blood the only cure that can bring those previously condemned into light and life. Great movie, and a great allegory of the greatest message of hope.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What would you do if you were the last living human being on Earth, after a bacteriological war killed off billions of your fellow man? In THE OMEGA MAN, a very loose adaptation of Richard Matheson's classic 1954 novel "I Am Legend", Charlton Heston gives us some ideas.His extreme right-wing political views aside, I have always found Charlton Heston to be a consistently fine actor, even more so when he's away from those big costume epics. THE OMEGA MAN finds him in the position of being the last man on Earth, or at least Los Angeles, two years after a Chinese-Russian border war exploded into a germ war. Now he's the only normal man left, thanks to an antidote he developed as the germs were spreading over the world. But every night, he is traumatized by a group of hooded, white-faced, vampire-like survivors, led by Anthony Zerbe, who want to destroy him and his science. Soon, Heston discovers other survivors--and there is, for the moment, hope that maybe Mankind can be saved.Despite the goofs that imdb.com mentions, THE OMEGA MAN otherwise gives us some compelling and chilling views of Downtown Los Angeles as a ghost town, with Heston being the only one really there. The cinematography by Russell Metty, who had worked on Orson Welles' TOUCH OF EVIL (with Heston), is brilliant. Not a perfect movie realistically, but this was during Heston's post-PLANET OF THE APES phase, where he did some pretty good work; and THE OMEGA MAN does work most of the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is thought-provoking and frightening. At the same time it is entertaining and fascinating in the same way as Romero's "Dead" trilogy. The film is a comment on man's responsibility as the highest life-form on the planet. It could also be interpreted as the struggle of the individual against the influence of the faceless society of today. It is actually quite dated, but I like that aspect of it. The setting of 1970's Los Angeles is unsettling enough, but with the city a ghost-town it becomes eerie and silent like an ancient tomb or pyramid. I think many Apocalyptic films borrowed the ideas in this movie and ran with them. This film is a re-telling of a story which had been filmed before with Vincent Price. The older version focused on the vampiric element of the antagonists. I had heard that a re-make was in the works. I could see James Cameron and "Arnold".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Omega Man Synopsis: Dr Robert Neville, a military doctor, who developed an experimental vaccine, is a survivor of an apocalyptic, biological war. The plague spread by conflict between Russia and China has killed almost everyone except for a few hundred albinos a nocturnal people called "The Family," extremely sensitive to light, homicidally psychotic and anti-materialistic. Teaming up with the last few normals left, Neville must combat them and preserve his sanity in an empty desolate world. Descent Into HellThe opening of Omega Man is more than riveting; it is transfixing. Welcome to Los Angeles, a dreary deserted city. The world is dead apparently except for 'The Family,' a collection of some dangerous hooded hooligans who by night besiege the holdout Dr Robert Neville secure behind the techno-moat and hi-tech ramparts of his castle. A bust of Caesar in his rooms pales in comparison to Dr Neville's fortitude and imperviousness to the threat without. The besieging monkish attired albinos suffering from after-effects of the virus are not creatures or vampires. Sincerely, rightly or wrongly, blaming science, technology, and materialism for the woes befallen, 'The Family,' despite its destructiveness, has overcome the racial conflicts that preceded the world catastrophe. How did this sorry state of affairs come about? Russia and China went to war unleashing a deadly virus on the world, killing most but reducing survivors to an intense paranoiac anti-materialism. A military doctor who found the anti-dote, Dr Neville is rescuing the treasures of civilisation by day when his albino opponents cannot endure direct sunlight. At night whatever Dr Neville can't rescue may be burned by Neville's paranoiac adversaries. The black-robed blanched-faced Family commune in a convoluted pseudo-liturgical lingo. Gleefully chanting "More! More books! Burn them all!," the Family is committed to razing all traces of normalcy. The Family burns with white hot fury at the last normal man Dr Neville, the smart scientific type that caused all the trouble in the first place. Led by the charismatic Matthias (Anthony Zerbe), The Family has no interest in Dr Neville's serum or salvation from their nocturnal routine of superstitious religious fanaticism. Is Dr Neville really alone? He thinks so but ringing pay phones seem to follow in his wake as he busies himself trying to save what little trinkets of scientific or cultural interest he can before his enemies emerge safely from the darkness at fall of night. Heston' shout rings louder than the summoning telephone buzz: "There is no phone ringing, d-#-%-@-&amp; it!!!" Yet there are other normal survivors with whom Dr Neville eventually links up. Leading this counter-Family is Lisa (Rosalind Cash) a tough, brave woman who has been struggling for survival with a group of children and an impotent science nerd. And magic is afoot. A new Adam and new Eve? Heston finds the lovely Lisa entrancing. Can the normals do as well as the abnormals in getting along together in a civilised way, long enough to preserve the human race from extinction? This reaches the essential contradiction between the normals and The Family. The "good guys" are willing to carry and use deadly machine guns against "bad guys" who have except for self-righteous rage against "the tools that destroyed the world" otherwise live in harmony amongst themselves. Even one of the normal children in Lisa's group warns Dr Neville, "Sometimes you scare me more than 'The Family.' " Yet as only Dr Neville's blood carries the needed antidote, all hopes for humanity rest with Neville. Don't forget humanity's hope for continuity also rest with Neville's Eve, the lovely Lisa. And here comes the mall scene. The normals decide against battling The Family in LA. Instead of continual warfare in the deserted streets the normals choose to depart for the protection of the countryside. Of course every Eve needs a trousseau for her new life in the wilderness. Dr Neville leaves Lisa in the mall to go shopping, but warns her not to stray too far from natural light as The Family finds solitude in the shadows. What woman ever listened to her true love in shopping decisions? Eve is taken by The Family and infected so that she can be the bait for the final battle with Dr Neville. Charlton Heston is outstanding in his role as Dr Robert Neville. The religious allusions and symbolism are haunting. The backdrop of a vacant LA, the mother of hedonistic materialism left desolate by the plague, seems cleverly appropriate. A savior in an apocalypse, Neville though mortally wounded collects up his blood for the normal survivors to preserve the antidote. The dreary theme, underlining throughout, reaches its crescendo in the tragedy of the ending. As the technological messiah saving the world from ignorance and superstition, Neville gives up the blood to redeem the normals from the dreaded darkness of superstition and irrationality.The MallThe mall is pivotal. A place of commerce, the mall represents the forelorn, shallow materialism that Neville and Lisa would preserve, but significantly even without charge cards its hidden recesses present dangers for the remaining creatures of the light: the psychotic albino adversaries might cling to the shaddows in a state of sonambulance safe from natural light. For all the Christian themes and symbolism, hoovering around the concept of redemption, exceedingly well executed in Omega Man, the children of the light espouse less Christian simplicity than dynamic materialism and conspicuous consumption.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlton Heston is not a good actor. We know this, we've seen the roles he plays, the incredible limitation of his acting range - this is one ham that does not taste any better with age. The Omega Man is a (then) fashionably downbeat view of the future, complete with slang that has aged just as well as the cheston himself. It could be somewhat believable that a plague could happen - it is somehow realistic that the only person apparently left is a pompous, arrogant, self-righteous self-obsessed windbag. However, it is unlikely that that the rest of the surviving population would be turned into photosensitive Bauhaus groupies.What follows is a film-by-numbers morality play that wavers between the unintentionally funny and the downright predictable.It would have been immensely more apt to have Richard Matheson's book in a crucifixion pose by the end and save charlton an hour in make-up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The second film version of Richard Matheson's classic novel "I Am Legend' stars Charlton Heston as a badass Robert Neville who machine guns his way through post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, killing as many mutants as he can. He eventually discovers he's not alone when he meets foxy Rosalind Cash and, after impressing her with his mad Evel Knievel motorcycle skills, takes her to pound town. Mutant leader Anthony Zerbe doesn't like any of it and spends most of the movie riling up his black-robed albino army to get rid of our hairy-chested superhero.Matheson's novel is really good and I'm surprised at how there has never been a movie adaptation that has done it proper justice. The Vincent Price version was the best, in my opinion, but it had its share of flaws. This version is pretty good, although it changes a lot of what was in the novel. For one thing there are no vampires here, just a cult of albinos who talk a lot and throw spears because they reject technology or some such silliness. There are many other changes but the basic gist of the story is still there. The scenes filmed with what appeared to be a Los Angeles full of empty streets are much more impressive to me than the CGI version of the same in Will Smith's I Am Legend. The early parts of the movie before Heston meets the other survivors are my favorite parts. Didn't care for the Christ allegory stuff at the end. It didn't offend me or anything; I just rolled my eyes at it for lacking subtlety. I really enjoyed the score from Ron Grainer. It's fun for what it is: a '70s action movie with some sci-fi and horror elements and, most importantly, Charlton Heston manning it up for all the world to admire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Army doctor Robert Neville struggles to create a cure for the plague that wiped out most of the human race. Due to an experimental vaccine, Dr. Robert Neville is the only survivor of an apocalyptic war waged with biological weapons. The plague caused by the war has killed everyone else except for a few hundred deformed, nocturnal people calling themselves "The Family". The plague has caused them to become sensitive to light, as well as homicidally psychotic. They believe science and technology to be the cause of the war and their punishment, and Neville, as the last symbol of science, the old world, and a "user of the wheel", must die. Neville, using electricity, machinery, and science attempts to hold them at bay. Roger Ebert wrote "If anybody has to be the last man in the world, I suppose it might as well be Charlton Heston. At least we know we're in good hands. He outmaneuvered the apes in "Planet of the Apes" (1968), so why not send him up against the ghouls in "The Omega Man"? They're not a whole lot smarter. Also, if God should decide to start the human race again, Heston could always be Moses. Or God." Charlton Heston just has that presence, that arrogant demeanor where he screams at the world that doesn't understand what is going on. Some might think it becomes annoying but it actually works very well in this movie. The Omega Man is actually a unique little look at the world, which here is populated by one man, Charlton Heston. For a Science Fiction movie this movie is pretty deep. He is combating a group of zombies that seek to kill all humans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite some mistakes, The Omega Man is still a great action film. Those mistakes, for me, start off with the music. No, not because it's old because it just doesn't fit sometimes! Example: In the middle of an action scene, I don't want to hear this groovy laid back stuff, what I want to hear is something suspenseful. I don't mean the music is ALWAYS misplaced, but it happens a few times. For our other mistake, I'll be talking about the hoods. Yes, hoods are creepy, but some of the mutants hoods in this movie look all shiny, which takes away some of their creepiness. (And mentioning the mutants is not a spoiler- they're on the film's cover. But besides that, this film is great for many reasons. Charlton Heston gives a great performance as the last man on earth, and his enemies are also played very well. Just like the performances, the movie's creepy throwback atmosphere is great, and the film really pulls you in with interesting ideas and exciting set pieces. In all The Omega Man is an excellent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoiler/plot- 1971 The Omega Man, A remake, The world is covered with germ warfare that makes people into sunlight hating albinos while the lead character Robert Neville is the only person left uninfected. He is a military bio-scientist that was trying to cure the contagion. At night the infected try to kill Neville and during the day Neville tries to capture the infected for his experiments to cure them. *Special stars- Charlton Heston, lead as Dr. Neville. Anthony Zerbe as news anchor head of the radical albino infected. Rosalind Cash is the black female lead and immediate object of Neville's ardor. *Theme- The military and science is always bad, but they finally will out. *Based on- Richard Matheson's novel, I Am Legend. *Trivia/location/goofs- Many locations in the EMPTY downtown area around Los Angeles and Dodger Stadium. Nice interracial mix between Heston and Cash in early days. Illustrates Heston's long time support for the 60's Black Civil Rights movement. *Emotion- Enjoyable to watch purely for Heston's classic film personae. The film's ending scene's is a nice touch much like the twist ending of Heston's 'Planet of the Apes'. The book story was supposed to be American Gothic, while this film was only two dimensional gadget strewn filmed hip bachelor against mindless light less bloodless zombies. Exciting but not very deep in overall deep message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that Chuck Heston's made some great movies in the 70's when he was no longer the true matinee type and Omega Man is likely my favourite. My husband disagrees and argues for Soylent Green but when we were dating I knew he was worth a second look just because he did not think it was odd that I loved both movies. For people who trash the movie ....hey it isn't supposed to be Hamlet!! (Okay maybe it is and I missed something) The lack of irony in the Christ like sacrafice could only have been done with Chuck. His wooden style was perfectly suited for this role who wants an emotional hero battling zombies? Anthony Zerbe as the mutant leader who was a former TV broadcaster/journalist (brief scene) make me wonder if I might be battling a Fox pundit in the aftermath of society. Chuck battles the mutants in a weary way that suggests it is futile much like the way people trudged through the 70's and while the special effects are cheesey and there are some medical improbabilities I jump for joy every time it is on TV and why the hell isn't it out on DVD yet?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very much a film of its time, from its post-hippie sentiments to Rosalind Cash's cool haircut, this is still a surprisingly moving apocalypse film with several set-pieces that have slipped into cult movie history. Robert Neville (Heston) plays chess with himself and floodlights his house, a liberal-conservative trapped in the past, desperate to pretend that the world hasn't ended, yet he watches reruns of 'Woodstock' until he knows all the words. His time is ending, and perhaps the new world will belong to the light-sensitive infected creatures who roam the city streets...There's a thudding Christ-analogy at the end, but before that you get great shoot-outs, creepy deserted streets and a sensational score by English composer Ron Grainer, who sank bells in water to create it. And no-one but Heston can wipe a shirt under his sweaty arms and still look cool...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally got around to watching Soylent Green and Omega Man back to back. Enjoyed both films immensely.For Omega Man, loved the feeling of loneliness which pervaded the beginning of the movie when it looked like Neville was the only survivor of a worldwide epidemic.Loved the concept of "The Family" -- a group of zombie-like beings brainwashed by a charismatic leader.Loved the romance between Neville and Lisa. Loved that Rosalind Cash played a role as a Black woman which was not stereotypical.Loved the ending where a small group of survivors run for the hills and start a brand new world (or so I hope).Loved the fact that this movie was not gory. Not really sure if it can be called a horror movie. Reminded me of 28 Days Later, which has a similar theme of a few survivors fighting against hordes of infected beings.The ending was good, although I would have liked to see Neville survive and somehow kill "The Family", but I guess this wasn't supposed to be a feel good movie.If you're a Heston fan, you'll enjoy his 70s films (Planet of the Apes, Soylent Green and this one). If I Am Legend is a remake of this film, I have to say that I enjoyed Omega Man more. Seemed more entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Exciting Sci-Fi Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, add a red convertible with one of the finest character actors of his era, Charlton Heston, driving it, add a machine gun, show him cruising down the boulevard and then abruptly coming to a stop and firing off a burst of gunfire at a shadowy mutant in a building window, and you have the start of a classic sci-fi action thriller.Charlton Heston portrays Doctor Robert Neville, an ex-Army doctor who was working on a vaccine for a virus caused by biological weapons employed in a final war in which the remaining survivors are reduced to half-human, psychotic mutants known as the Family. Led by Brother Matthias ( brilliantly portrayed by actor Anthony Zerbe, who has a long list of television and movie credits ),they wage a non-stop agenda in destroying any vestiges of modern society,and constant attacks against our hero, Dr. Neville. And Neville answers with frequent use of his Smith and Wesson M76 submachine gun and Browning automatic rifle with an early nightscope to retaliate against the Family's nightly attacks.The movie is ripe with irony and sarcasm, such as when Neville wrecks his car at the start of the movie and then replies "there's never a cop around when you need one." The scene with Neville in the movie theatre watching Woodstock is priceless, as is his running monologue with Caesar, his bust statue in his apartment, undoubtedly to try and maintain his sanity. After an attack by the Family, he turns to Caesar while playing chess and quips "was it your move or mine?" The movie also has racial overtones which fit into the context of the 70s when the movie was made. This comes into play when Neville discovers Lisa,( Rosalind Cash ) a black female, is actually alive and tries to communicate with her. She finally accepts him and comes to his apartment and the dialog takes on the sexual and racial innuendos.The constant conflict with Brother Matthias and the Family provide a nonstop thrill ride throughout the movie as Neville seeks to find "the nest" which the Family inhabits by day while they wage their unholy war by night against Neville in his last domain, the apartment where he lives. Aside from Planet Of the Apes, this was one of Charlton Heston's better sci-fi roles and should be thoroughly enjoyed by fans of the science-fiction genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I disagree a little with the original comment about the film. I thought it was brilliant when I first saw it and still think it brilliant! So the camera work is a bit quirky? So what! This is 1970's and they didn't have the luxury of the technology of the recent version: I am Legend, which despite the clever special effects, I found The Omega Man far superior!Charlton Hestons' wardrobe was dated, even camp looking, but once again, this was the 1970's! Anthony Zerbs character of the mad and creepy Mathias, adds a eerie creepiness to the film, and even though the sets do look like film sets, it doesn't matter as you get caught up with the cranking up of streets of a darkened city, devoid of life, lighting and people except the mob of Mathias's followers!So what if you see vehicles in the distant! I didn't notice any until I read this site, and believe me, you won't notice either! But for people who have spent time alone, they may identify with Heston's Robert Nevill character, which makes the film thought provoking considering todays climate of terrorism.The scenes of empty streets, and and empty Los Angelas send a chill up your spine, and remember, this was made 30years + before 28days later and similar films of todays genre!The films a classic and is in the same genre of Hestons other sci-fi classics such as Soilent Green and Planet of the Apes, all films made even better, because of the stature of Charlton Hestons big screen presence!Watch it!

		<fullReview>Now living in the late 1970's, a former army Colonel/Scientist Robert Neville (Oscar-Winner:Charleton Heston) is living in a deserted Los Angeles. After surviving a disastrous plague, which it's been several years that Robert is alone and he thinks he is the only man alive in the entire world. But when it turns dark outside... there's a group of cultists who called themselves "The Family" (Led by Anthony Zerbe), who got affected by the plague. "The Family" are photosensitive mutants, who can't be outside during the day expect night-time. They also are trying to destroyed every technology or human, they could find. Which Robert battles with these freaks of nature nearly every night to survive. But Robert finds out, he is not alone in the city. When he meets a tough survivor Lisa (Roselind Cash) and other humans are not turned by the virus. Now Robert finds another chance to find a cure against these monsters. Before it's too late.Directed by Boris Segal made an intriguing Science Fiction movie that has moments of action, suspense and some moments of comedy. Segal's film is also visually striking, especially the wide empty streets of L.A. but unfortunately the feature has some incredibly campy moments at rather tense sequences. Heston is very good at his role here. Which it is one of the reasons why "The Omega Man" remain memorable for over the years. Although this is the second version of "I Am Legend", Based on a novel by Richard Matheson (Duel, A Stir of Echoes, What Dreams May Come). First version was done in the 1960's titled "The Last Man on Earth" starring Vincent Price and last year's "I Am Legend" starring Will Smith. Which these three films has the same premise but done completely different. The book also inspired filmmaker George A. Romero to created flesh eating zombies in the classic "Night of the Living Dead". Despite some serious flaws, "The Omega Man" is still a good movie. For those who are familiar with the recent adaptation "I Am Legend" and never seen this one. This is worth checking out. Panavision. (*** ?/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gloriously Cheesy 1970s Stuff!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My brothers and I loved this movie the first time we saw it at the drive-in theater in Commack, Long Island, NY. In 1971 we were 13, 12 and 10 years old. We were also fanatical Charlton Heston fans. In hindsight, we probably were the targeted demographic, given the cheesy dialog, poor production values and extreme violence of his movies. The "Planet Of The Apes" movie series whetted our appetite for Mr Heston's over-emoting and small weapons mastery. Then, "Omega Man" and "Soylent Green" came out with one year of each other. Both gave new meaning to the term "Christ Complex". SPOILER ALERT: The sight of his bullet ridden body at the end of the film in crucifixion pose gave us chills. Years later when we learned more about Chuck's far-right politics, did the scene give off a different vibe. But I digress. The guns. The hot black chick that gets down with Chuck (which again given his far-right politics, the scene now gives off a different vibe). Those crazy white faced, red-eyed zombies in their black bathrobes. What's not to love about this movie!? The perfect bookend to this movie is "Soylent Green", another dark futuristic thriller. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dated piece of '70's nihilistic sci-fi. Great mood, though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, the 2nd filmed version of Richard Matheson's amazing novel, I AM LEGEND (the first was Vincent Price's LAST MAN ON EARTH, and a 3rd is coming soon), is one of many cautionary sci-fi movies of the late '60s/early '70s (such as SILENT RUNNING, SOYLENT GREEN, COLOSSUS: THE FORBIN PROJECT, etc.). These movies were typically dark and bleak in their world view (STAR WARS would soon change all of that for better or worse; and from the maker of THX-1138, no less). The OMEGA MAN, though, is about a military scientist named Robert Neville (Chuck Heston himself) who, after a biological holocaust, seems to be the last "normal" man left in L.A. (are there ANY truly normal people in L.A.?). The other "survivors" have become albino, light sensitive, night crawler mutants (unlike the vampires of the book and 1st movie) who are like a cross between Edgar Wynter and the Manson Family. They've all taken to wearing sunglasses and hooded cloaks, and are genuinely creepy. Their main beef with Neville is that he tends to hunt them down during the day, with no more feeling than if he were squashing cockroaches. After Neville's capture by Mathius (the albinoid leader, played with relish and a lot of ham by Anthony Zerbe), he is freed by a radical band of drop-out med students and hippie-type kids who are trying to cure the mutated albinos. Neville is a bit uptight with this idea, as he attempted it before (in a flashback scene) and it didn't go over too well. His liberator, a Mod Squad, Angela Davis-type rebel (played by Rosalind Cash) wants Neville to cure her little brother, Richie, who is turning into an albino (insert bad Michael Jackson joke here!). Neville DOES find a cure, with his own blood (shades of Jesus; the one Bible character Heston hasn't played!). Well, now that he CAN cure them, does he WANT to? As Richie tells him, "You just don't belong...you're hos-tile!" So, little Richie takes it upon himself to extend the olive branch to the albinos......bad idea. There's more gunfire, and a typically downer '70s ending (I DO miss those every now and then). On the plus side, the early scenes where Heston is alone in an eerie, ghost town L.A. are moody and VERY effective(all without CGI!). And he plays the loneliness-bordering-on-insanity very well. Honestly, the first 45 min. or so are my favorite. The rebel scenes later on are a little bit too BILLY JACK for my taste (not that BILLY JACK isn't one of the funniest films EVER made, but save it for another time). The 1st filmed version, LAST MAN ON EARTH, was closer to the book but fatally miscast (I love Vincent Price, but he is from a very different school of horror). If you could somehow scoop Heston out of this movie and into that one (with OMEGA's creepier looking mutants, too) you'd really have something. As for the new version with Will Smith (who was inspiring in PURSUIT OF HAPPY-NESS; on auto-pilot in I, ROBOT), I will probably see it for love of the book. And I still hold out (the perhaps futile) hope they'll get it right someday (maybe not in my lifetime!). Chuck's version, in many ways, came THIS[ ] close!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Neville is the last man on Earth. After a rocket containing a deadly cilia-based disease is unleashed, the world becomes infected. But Neville has a prototype vaccine, and it works! Now he spends his days and nights hunting down those who are infected before they can kill him.This movie, based on Richard Matheson's "I Am Legend", is the second of three major adaptations (after the Vincnet Price version and before the Will Smith one). And in my humble opinion, it fails in comparison to the Price version, which seemed to really nail the idea of isolation and having to fight to survive against deadly others.This version is alright, and lot of fun to watch, but is done in a silly way that makes things seem light-hearted and not at all scary or dangerous. Neville (played by Charlton Heston) is firing off machine guns, driving fast cars and drinking wine. It's like an episode of "Miami Vice" or "Hawaii 5-0". Not to say I didn't like the movie -- I did -- but it seemed silly when guys in robes would jump out of nowhere and cocktail-inspired fight music would pick up.Charlton Heston is a good leading actor, as evidenced by not just this film, but also "Soylent Green" and "Ten Commandments" and "Planet of the Apes". But why does he need to take his shirt off? Maybe in 1971 times were different, but an old man with saggy chest muscles does not seem like something a lot of people would want to look at.There is an obvious Luddite theme in this film, with a cult that is anti-technology of any kind. However, the writer made it so we couldn't possibly identify with the cult, not even for a brief moment. They're ruthless and hypocritical and completely exaggerated. I can agree that when we are launching disease-carrying missiles we are using technology for evil ends, but why does that somehow make all technology bad, including apparently modern clothes? And where do we draw the line? Simple machines like a catapult and such are alright, but what isn't? What would make us a "creature of the wheel"? This movie is legend, and you really ought to see it. This, and the Vincent Price version, especially if you can get around to it before the new Will Smith version comes out, which will likely be the worst yet. Why can't they make one that is faithful to Matheson? (Allegedly because he's too gory, but isn't that what horror fans want?) But there are some interesting things going on here, and you'll be glad the world didn't end in the 1970s... if every day had to be like this, with these clothes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's 1977 and the world has been devastated with a biological plague launched during a war between the Communist superpowers, Russia and China. Only one man is immune from it and it's Charlton Heston who was one of a team of scientists who developed an antidote. Unfortunately for humanity it was too late, but Heston vaccinated himself and now lives as both the hunter and hunted in a devastated Los Angeles filled with these albino vampire zombies who are those that have survived among the human race.Now as I write this we are going into 30 years after this event was supposed to have occurred. Didn't mean something like this couldn't happen. In the intervening time we've seen the AIDS pandemic and governments paralyzed much like the zombies here who have surrendered to their doom, saying it's the will of the Deity. What might the human reaction be to something like what is depicted in The Omega Man.Still though the religious symbolism with Heston as a Christlike figure gets way too heavy handed at times. The Omega Man was groundbreaking at the time, but I'm not sure it has worn well with age. Best performance in The Omega Man has to be Anthony Zerbe, formerly a charismatic news commentator now charismatic leader of the Zombie pack.There's a remake of The Omega Man due out in 2007 starring Will Smith in the Charlton Heston part. Under the title of I Am Legend, the original title of the book The Omega Man is based on, it will be interesting to see if the new film incorporates some of the history The Omega Man didn't foresee.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adaptation of Richard Matheson's book "I Am Legend", previously filmed as "The Last Man on Earth" with Vincent Price, features Charlton Heston as seemingly the last healthy man left on the planet. Most everyone else is either dead or one of an army of night-dwelling, light-sensitive zombies with bluish-white skin. "The Omega Man" catches one off-guard with its grimly violent and serious scenario. There are many tightly-composed, thoughtful sequences, such as Heston sitting in a deserted movie theater watching "Woodstock" for the 100th time; fending off attacks by 'The Family' in his townhouse, where his only companion is a bust of Caesar; or saving a young boy from certain death. Anthony Zerbe is positively commanding as the leader of the undead, Rosalyn Cash very fine as a curious love-interest for Heston. Some of the dialogue is silly (a child asking post-Moses Charlton Heston if he's God...please!); nevertheless, though the picture is ultimately too much of a downer, it isn't a cop-out and has a powerful finish. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Almost Empty City for Chuck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you see Chuck Heston toolin' around town in that red convertible before even the credits begin, the city all his, you realize right away this is essential Heston. As he explains later, this is where he lives and no band of mutates or any other son of a bitch will get him to leave. In this version of history, the world went all to hell about 1975, thanks to biological warfare; the buildings remain but most people are dead - circa 1977, when Heston, as Neville, seemingly rules the empty streets (a half-dozen years in the future to the audiences who originally saw this picture). Neville alternates his time between watching "Woodstock" in an empty theater, playing chess with a bust of Caesar, and hunting for the 'nest' where the mutated albinos hang out during daytime. His days aren't all that bad; sure he's lonely, but he still has a purpose - wiping out those 'vermin' as he calls them (with good reason; they are quite barbaric). Neville, the last real man, represents modern technology; the mutates (led by Matthias, an ex-newscaster played by Zerbe in a magnetic rendition) have embraced a pre-industrial position, resembling nothing so much as torch-waving witch-hunters from 300 years ago. This sets up a natural conflict, paving the way for some nice action; Heston's character is not one to sit around moping &amp; crying, and he more than obliges 'the family' in battling back against them as they harass him with their braying, their clumsy attacks.When I was a teenager, I would often imagine what it would be like as the sole survivor of a holocaust, in an empty city; this was the film which promoted most of those daydreams. Neville's position as sole man shifts at the midway point, when he's rescued by a couple of other younger survivors (Cash as the last woman and Koslo as Dutch, the last college student). It turns out Neville is the only one truly immune to the bio-attack due to a lucky serum used in the 11th hour on himself. Now he switches from resourceful terminator to mankind's savior, even taking on non-too-subtle Christ connotations. This was to the detriment of the film, which is why it doesn't rate 9 or 10 stars from me. And it comes across as rather quaint and funky nowadays, but back then it seemed pretty radical, with Heston (the MAN as he's called at one point) getting down with a foxy African American chick (most racial problems go out the window when there's not enough people left). For trivia buffs, we all know there are a few scenes (too many) where you can see moving cars in the far distance as Heston drives in the foreground. Getting back to the credits sequence, just after Neville gets a flat tire, you can actually see someone on foot for half-a-second way in the background. But this could be one of the family braving daytime for a few seconds, or even Dutch sneaking around behind Neville's back. I'm also very fond of the musical score, and it's one of those I can't get out of my head on certain days. Based on Richard Matheson's 'I Am Legend' - remade in 2007 with Will Smith.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A germ of a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Call me a nostalgia buff, but for me this is one of the most seminal science fiction films of the period, along with (and strangely enough also featuring Charlton Heston) Soylent Green and Planet of the Apes. The pessimistic storyline can be attributed to writer Richard Matheson. Based upon 'I Am Legend' (earlier filmed with Vincent Price) the novels tells the story of the last man on the planet besieged by vampires. Here, the vampires have been updated to mutants, a product of biological warfare. A cracking musical score and uncompromising visuals set this film apart from the crowd. Heston commands the screen as the uncompromising remainder of the 'old order'. The mutants are clearly a metaphor for rising urban violence. And the sense of a city killed by plague is eerily brought to life by the straightforward direction. This film is bursting with atmosphere and like other Heston films, transcends the genre to become almost symbolic. In short, it's a real classic from the 1970s that is all too often overlooked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poor Charlton Heston! The only man left alive after a germ warfare apocalypse and he still has to deal with eight tracks! There lies the film's reputation. Its actually not a horribly made little sci-fi film. However, it is so dated and some aspects are so campy that its fondly remembered as a cult classic today.There are several very positive aspects of the film. Say what you will about Charlton Heston, in his prime he made a damn good action hero. He has enough charisma to make the early scenes of him driving around bearable. Plus the cult of undead ghouls after him make for surprisingly scary villains, with the makeup appropriately unnerving. However, the film has dated poorly which makes it so appealing today. Its meshing of sci-fi thrills with blaxploitation in the second half make this a supreme guilty pleasure. Plus, there is an abundance of instantly quotable lines. "The Omega Man" is one of the mos enjoyable genre flicks of the decade. For a companion piece, check out Vincent Price's version of Richard Matheson's source novel "I Am Legend" entitled "The Last Man on Earth". Its a more well made film, but is probably not as entertaining. (6/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Omega Man, 1971 6/10, 6th Best Movie of 1971, 41st best of the 70s, 574th all time The Omega Man is LOOSELY based on the novel "I Am Legend" by Richard Matheson, one of my favorite books of all time. That "LOOSELY" should be stressed as much as is humanely possible. It is almost completely dissimilar from the book. Normally that would mean a death sentence for my enjoyment of the movie, but this time that's not the case. This movie survives as watchable because it goes so far from its source material. If the movie would have chosen to change only 7 or 8 key aspects of the book I likely would have found myself yelling at my television. However, this movie changed enough things that I was able to resign myself to the movie being completely separate from the book within 18 seconds of the movies beginning. Thus by looking at the movie independently from the book I was able to say that it really wasn't half bad. It was over-the-top and cheesy at times, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. It was a fairly cool vision of the apocalypse, and I enjoy watching Chuck Heston playing the ultimate bad-ass scientist. If they would have taken a direct interpretation of the book I might be ranking this movie as a 10/10 or a 1/10, as it is they changed it up, played it weird, and got a 6. Good enough eh?</fullReview>

This is a kick-**s 70's true sci-fi movie. Admittedly, the albino zombie-like freaks are not really scary enough but to see Neville go 'slightly mad' is really worth it. Since Neville is the last man on Earth he is constantly talking to himself, playing chess against himself, and dressing up for his sausage-Sunday dinner. He goes to the movies to see a woodstock drugumentary for the third year in a row -- and he knows the all the lines. Then he fights off a few albino religious freaks with his machine gun before doing some shopping in the local mall. This movie must have inspired later sci-fi flicks like Terry Gilliam's 12 Monkies and Spielberg's War of the Worlds. In my opinion, Omega man easily beats other 70/80s kitch sci-fi like Soylent Green and Quiet Earth. But not the magnificent Planet of the Apes (also starring C. Heston).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every few years I get out my copy of The Omega Man, a goofy Chuck Hestoner with our hero living out his days in a world destroyed by the weirdest bioweapon ever cooked up. Heston is all glib comments and flashing false teeth as he keeps up a psychotic conversation with himself, swilling bourbon, driving through the emptied streets of LA, and mowing down mutated survivors of a plague loosed on the world in a Russian/Chinese border dispute.It's very groovy and heavy and meaningful as Heston and a newly-discovered group of non-mutant survivors battle nocturnal baddies (led by the always-interesting Anthony Zerbe). The love interest is a very believable Ruby Dee who gives the movie some actual credentials of seriousness because she's so angry and vulnerable, not to mention she's black (and Heston's white--no segregation left in this brave new world, folks!) What's weird is that the movie got a PG. The violence isn't that intense, even with lots of orangey movie gore being spilled by gun and spear. What stands out is seeing Ruby Dee in her way-better-than-average birthday suit more than once. She is a very good looking woman and I'm not going to complain, but her nakeditity (a Radar O'Reillyism) is jarring and quite inappropriate, almost as if the movie-makers said to themselves, "We don't want just another Planet of the Apes--let's flash some T and A!"Although The Omega Man is a campy, entertaining stroll down Hollywood's late '60's and early '70's, Armaggedon-fixated memory lane, it's an R movie. Dee's front and backside (no matter how pleasant) are the only false notes in an otherwise perfect vehicle for adolescent angst about the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a bit muddled philosophically: there are some half-hearted attempts to "question" Heston's morality, like a scene where a kid says "Sometimes you scare me more than The Family", yet he's clearly the one to root for, the only hope of humanity, and at the end he's set up as a Christ figure. But it's still a fine piece of moviemaking, and a definite improvement on the pale 1964 version of the same story ("The Last Man On Earth"). This remake, of sorts, has a lot more impact, and the "vampires" (or whatever you wanna call them) are a more existing and constant threat (and far more intelligent, too). However, this is not the altogether great movie that could, conceivably, be made from this story. (**1/2)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a Charlton Heston fan (as a result of the first two PLANET OF THE APES films), I found myself first in line the Wednesday THE OMEGA MAN opened. The newspaper ads had looked spooky: Chuck, armed with a machine gun, was firing into surrounding darkness. "The last man on Earth," the copy read, "...Is not alone!" So, there I was, snatching up a couple of the freebies laid on the concession counter- mock-up newspapers featuring NEWS FROM THE END OF THE WORLD! There were black and white shots from the movie. I was hooked. The movie itself was a mixed bag, even then. The last man on Earth wasn't exactly alone, after all... Nor did he have to do his own stunts... Still, the movie was great, if for no other reason than Charlton Heston's performance. That was 1971... Three decades later, while it's definitely dated, it's still an entertaining movie to watch. Vastly inferior to the novel upon which it is loosely based (Richard Matheson's brilliant I AM LEGEND, adapted by the Corringtons, the husband and wife team who also gave us the abyssmal BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES), it nonetheless holds up as a good SF shocker STILL notable for Heston's performance. (One can only imagine what could've been wrought had they opted to do the novel the justice it deserves.) This was the second time around for I AM LEGEND; perhaps the third time will be the charm...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was horrible. It was a complete nightmare to watch, and totally tedious. Instead of writing concise sentences on why this movie was so horrendous to me, I will simply list the negative points about the film: 1. The dialogue - When I heard Heston scream out "It's turning into night," that's when I knew I was in for a long night.2. Neville - I had an easier time connecting with one of the many manikins in the film than Neville. He was interestingly uninteresting. The dog in "I Am Legend" was an added necessity for Will Smith's character recognition. It helped.3. The Family - Even though they can articulate like intelligent human beings, they proved to be more mindless than the mindless monsters running around in "I Am Legend." 4. The romance - This should have been number one on this list. I didn't buy the romance for one split second. It was laughably absurd. It only took a second for it to happen. And I didn't believe Heston was even attracted to her.5. Richie or Richard (whatever) - What was he thinking? 6. The performances - For-the-birds.7. Camera work - I started calling out the next shot before it happened, like the zoom in on Heston when he found Richie's note. It looked shamefully amateurish and predictable for what was a string of corny shots since the beginning of the film.8. Music - It was all done in one night on a Casio synthesizer keyboard.9. Make up/Effects - Okay. What was with the red Kool-aid and, in some cases, the Campbell's tomato soup as blood? And granted, the CGI monsters in "I Am Legend" weren't easy on the eyes or sensibility (I hated them), but I can appreciate them more than the intellectual, pale faces walking around in their Jedi cloaks.10.The ending - Need I say more? Overall, it was an awful film. If I could give it "zero" stars, I would.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generally correct adaptation of the book with a few missteps along the way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second adaptation of Richard Matheson's I Am Legend, the first being 1964's Italian-filmed LAST MAN ON EARTH with Vincent Price. Charlton Heston takes the lead in this initially promising film which also ends up taking liberties with Matheson's story. The end result is a slick slice of '70s nihilism with surprisingly explicit scenes of bloody violence - love those squibs - and nudity which holds together well. The post-apocalyptic story could have been told better, but the budget has been put to good use in creating some highly impressive backdrops of a deserted and ruined Los Angeles - best used at the film's opening, as the first quarter of an hour puts across superbly Heston's isolated situation and the state of the post-nuke world.Charlton Heston is always a fun hero to have on board and he gets to engage in some of his shouty overacting which is pleasing to hear - nobody does it better than Chuck. His able nemesis is played by the seedy Anthony Zerbe, playing a mad preacher who leads a tribe of albino mutants, plague victims close to death, whose sole desire is to drive Heston from his safe house and burn him alive. Nice folks, huh? The albino makeup is very impressive and when combined with white contact lenses it leaves an ultra-scary impression; something like Reggie Nalder in SALEM'S LOT but somehow more diseased and twisted, considering that the mutants were once human. The film is technically superior, with good music, editing, and photography.The action sequences are nicely shot and invariably exciting. Most of them involve burning hooded horrors running around screaming whilst Heston empties his machine-gun into them which is fine by me. The main complaint with the script is the introduction of a group of isolated hippies who serve only to further muddy the water and are purely a '70s invention. The more characters, the more cluttered and complex the story, so the fight between Heston and Matheson's "vampires" is diluted and thrown aside in parts. Rosalind Cash is the steamy love interest and her presence adds a then-controversial interracial relationship to the movie which slows it down in places. Things pick up for a surprisingly downbeat conclusion; kudos to the script-writers for not changing that, and not seeking an easy way out by making things happy. In comparison to LAST MAN ON EARTH, I would say both productions are equally good: very different in tone and scope, but both watchable for their own particular reasons. Sci-fi addicts should check this one out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apocalypse Now?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I began The Omega Man with some initial trepidation from the not so great editing (including a pointless fade away on zooming out shot), the use of sped up footage and obvious line dubbing. Thankfully after that it gets better. You must appreciated that the filmmakers clearing the streets of Los Angles, with spanning, wide shots of the city in which it is deserted, no easy task. To accomplish this the filmmakers had to film during Sunday morning, and due to filming at this golden hour, the deserted streets and the golden light reflecting of the buildings has a real beauty to it. I don't know of the film's budget, but it does come off feeling like a low budget production, but does so in a charming way. The campy 70's sounding music score feels like it's on the verge of killing the mood and being too corny, but manages to avoid doing so.Charlton Heston's Nevillie feels like predecessor to modern action movie heroes with his use of one liners. The scene in which he pretends to negotiate with a dead salesman at a car dealership feels very Arnold Schwarzenegger. I find there is some Initial unintentional humour coming from seeing Heston dressed as an aristocrat and talking to a chess playing bust of Julius Caesar, but once that settles these do showcase some poignant scenes of the last man alive trying to keep himself occupied. Also I do love this little world he has created for himself. Seeing the later Republican Heston watching and the enjoying the film Woodstock and even reciting lines is intriguingly odd. The Omega Man also features one the earliest on screen interracial kisses between black and white. I don't know if it was intentional that a film about repopulating the Earth has an interracial romance, but thankfully doesn't have to call attention to itself.The Omega is a perfect example of Charlton Heston's immense screen presence and his ability to carry a movie, as he spends much of the run time alone. When I think "screen presence", several actors will pop into my head, Burt Lancaster, Kirk Douglas, Clark Gable and of course, Charlton Heston.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall I liked the movie. It's a pretty decent seventies flick. I really just wouldn't have put the premise that this was based on the I am legend novel.There are a number of quibbles I have: If the vampire psychotic things were totally against technology. I don't think they would be using sunglasses. Sunglasses are a piece of technology whether or not the "vampires" realized it. Also, their clothes are a form of technology. The catapult they use to attack his house is a form of technology. So, they essentially argue that technology brought down society. However, they still use technology. They just pick and choose what they want to use. I also look at the fact that his house was really poorly secured. Even without using the "technology" they didn't want to use. They should have still been able to take the house in faster than two years. You could just break his house, and set it on fire. All his windows were boarded up with were wood. The ending was also nothing like "I am Legend". As there was no real overarching irony which the novel is primarily known for. All those things aside though. I still like this movie. It is entertaining, and it keeps your attention somewhat throughout the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1975, a Sino-Russian global biological war breaks out and military doctor Robert Neville (Charlton Heston) tries an experimental vaccine on himself. He survives a helicopter crash and the plague. He could be the last man on earth. He's barricaded inside his home during the night while the albino mutants roam. The mutants are led by Matthias who is trying to kill him as the last symbol of the scientific past that brought about the disaster. He is captured by Matthias and then rescued by Dutch and Lisa. They belong to a community of young survivors.This movie has two great aspects. First there is the interracial love story which is edgy for its time. Second is the empty streets of L.A. Of course, there was no CGI back then and the streets needed to be emptied for real. As a movie, it's rather slow moving and boring. The acting is a little stiff which Heston does sometimes. It's cheesy without being that much fun. The good stuff isn't enough to overcome its deficiencies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the Omega Man when I was a kid and it is one of the few sci-fi films that stayed with me.I have never been a huge fan of Charlton Heston, but he is in fine acting form in this movie.The Omega Man is loosely base on Richard Matheson's The Last Man On Earth. The movie does differ from the book in many ways. In the book bacteria creates a plague that turns humanity into vampire like creature, in the movie it is biological warfare that kills off most of the human race, the ones that are left become these weird albino mutants.The one person to survive is U.S. Army Col. Robert Neville, M.D, played by Heston. He is hunted by The Family, a group of mutated humans who led by Johnathan Matthias, a former news anchorman who is now leader of the Family.I do have to say that it is at this point where the film is stolen from under Charlton Heston by Anthony Zerbe's brilliant performance as the mad messiah that is leading the mutant 'Family.' He plays a truly menacing figure and the leader of the mutant cult.Rosalind Cash as Lisa the tough talking romantic lead is quite good as is Paul Koslo as Dutch and Eric Laneuville who plays Richie.The Omega Man is a thoughtful film that goes beyond the usual shoot-em-up. Not to say that there isn't any action, there is plenty, but it is s film that goes beyond that.The Omega Man is a classic of the sci-fi genre along with The Incredible Shrinking Man, The Day The Earth Stood Still and The Invasion Of The Bodysnatchers. It was also not afraid to do a downer ending at a time when most films seem to tack on a happy ending no matter how silly it was.If you get a chance, check it out, I don't think you will regret it.</fullReview>

The whole vampire thing of the original Matheson book was so passé even when it was written that the screen writers' germ-war revamping cleverly suited the Cold War times the film was made in (and got around the now over-done and inaccurate zombie thang -- it's ghouls who come back from the dead and eat people, not zombies, but the whole moronic zombie genre and its fans obviously have never heard of a dictionary, but then this is Generation Y we're talking about here -- why can't they bother looking in a dictionary perhaps?).Heston and the cast perform well, the action sequences are of a high standard, Ron Grainer's music is superb and Anthony Zerbe is a marvellous mystic leader of the post- apocalyptic, Spanish Inquisition-like Family. There are also overtones of the Nazi era, as the Family destroy everything from books to machines they don't agree with.The original Vincent Price version, The Last Man on Earth, is closer to the book, but this is miles ahead of the dreadful zombie flicks of recent years, and the unworthy I Am Legend 2007 remake, and is worthy of higher ratings than it's been given here. And please, someone in Hollywood, look up the difference between zombies and ghouls...

		<fullReview>The Omega Man is one of my all time favorite movies. While a little different than "Last Man On Earth" which was the original movie based on the book entitled "I am Legend" it is quite the same in many ways. Although I loved last man as well, this one is my favorite since it is in more modern times in an era in which I grew up. I was a teenager in the 1970s so it hits home for me because there was still a threat of nuclear war at that time as we were well into the cold war and no where near its end.Charleston Heston is a great lead for this movie, and Rosalind Cash is such a great actress she never seems to be acting. A very underrated actor she is. Plus she is a very good looking woman and very convincing in this role. The characters are all very well played as well.I also feel that if something like this ever happens it will be very much like this. Zombies are harder to accept as reality than mutated wackos due to a lingering disease.There are some but very few slight continuity errors in this version, like in the open Nevel is driving thru LA and supposedly the last normal man on Earth and you can see in one shot another car driving in the background. Another worse one is when Nevel and the last girl on Earth are riding the 1972 Honda SL350 out of the stadium. It is obvious it is NOT Charleston Heston as the rider and they make no attempt to mask that other than a thin one where the rider looks away from camera when close to the camera.One more is when Rosalind first talks to Nevel in the stadium she is holding a gun which is totally obviously a plastic toy on him. It doesn't even have a hole in the barrel.Other than those few problems, which I never noticed in the first ten times I saw this movie, the movie is excellent and a great watch. And as said, one of the believable scenarios of what it might really be like after the apocalypse actually happens.The movie is also very well shot and well scripted and of course well acted by all. BTW Paul Koslo is also very underrated and steals a lot of scenes in the role of Dutch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I Am Legend" has been a strangely consistent story. Not only did it inspire the zombie apocalypse as we know it, it's birth three major adaptation, each very different from one another. "The Last Man on Earth" matches the book's bleak tone and features one of Vincent Price's most serious performances. The most recent "I Am Legend" was more of a remake of this film and, as far as a modern blockbuster adaptation of the material goes, far stronger then I expected, not to mention featuring an unusually strong Will Smith performance. But out of all the adaptations of Richard Matheson's landmark novel, this one is probably my favorite. Awash in seventies kitsch and featuring Charlton Heston at his bronzed matinée god macho best, "The Omega Man" Though horrific, the last man on earth concept appeals to us for other reasons. Like the zombie apocalypse, it serves a certain level of wish-fulfillment. The film opens with Chuck Heston tearing down an abandoned LA street in a sports car. When that car gets a flat, he just goes to the dealership and grabs another one. Though all versions of the story make it clear that living in a world alone has a negative effect on one's sanity, in this rendition Robert Neville is haunted by a phantom ringing phone; I'm sure there are times when any of use would like to be completely alone, especially those of use who live in an urban locale. In all versions, Robert Neville is also something of a total master of his domain. Like all the nut-job survivalist in the world, living in a walled-off compound, blasting huge guns, totally relying upon ourselves and no one else? It's a form of absolute power and that would appeal to just about anyone. Of course, the world of "The Omega Man" comes at a horrible price. Unlike angsted vampire slayer Vincent Price, Charlton Heston has no such qualms about blasting away at the hordes of the half-living with machine guns and grenades. Unlike Will Smith looking for a cure, it's even an established character trait of Heston's Neville that he only wants to destroy the infected.A position the film itself seems not entirely sure on. Another reason "The Omega Man" stands among the adaptations of Matheson's novel is because the infected are intelligent, not senseless zombies or animals. Though most of the movie would seem to agree with Heston's notorious gun obsessed ways, I can't help but pause at the moment when one of the family pulls out a revolver. While the story deviates wildly from the source material (Matheson's novel is covered in about the first half-hour, with the novel's ending having a wildly different pay-off), Neville is still doubtlessly a morally ambiguous character. Well, even if he is ambiguous, the movie still ends with him in a Christ-like pose, his blood being the cure to save all mankind. (Imagine "Eat me, drink me, I am the Lord!" in Heston's leathery growl.) Even then, this is Chuck Heston in full-on action hero mode. "The Omega Man" is an action film, foremost. There are several fantastic, gun-slinging moments. The early invasion of Neville's garage is a favorite, as is his march of revenge on the streets at the end. My favorite moment is the motorcycle escape through the mutant-filled sports stadium. It's not a bad performance, with Chuck sneaking one or two moment of subtly in among all the histrionics and action star theatrics. The supporting cast certainly helps. Anthony Zerbe matches Heston, ham for ham. The presence of Rosalind Cash and Lincoln Kilpatrick, both sporting full afros, mark this as something of a blaxploitation flick. Both give good performances, even if neither actors' jive-talk has aged well and Heston and Cash's romance never quite gel. The movie drags a little bit in its later half, in-between action scenes. The action tone overwhelms the sometimes legitimately effective horror elements and the mostly for plot purpose sci-fi elements.I like the movie plenty well but I full-blown love its score. Ron Grainer's music is what I like to call "Gothic Disco." The driving horns and beats are pure '70s funk, that wouldn't be out of place in a "Shaft" sequel. Grainer's maintains the macabre tone with howling organs. It's like the Phantom of the Opera stepped into Wattstax. I adore it. The music along bumps "The Omega Man" up a grade or two in my book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Am Legend suffered because the vampires from the novel were turned into badly rendered CGI zombie-type things. The Omega Man, on the other hand, suffers because the vampires are turned into albino Luddites. Yeah, that's right. Albino Luddites.Maybe the image of white-faced, sunglass wearing monks sounds scary on paper, but on film it's somewhat humorous. Oh no, please spare me from the pasty-faced hoodies. Oh how they terrify me. But it also doesn't help that these so-called psychopaths (Heston's words) act like the Keystone Cops.The Family, as they're called, first appear after Robert Neville (Heston) struggles to get home before nightfall. There he is parking his car when a hooded individual throws a lighted torch at him and drops down into his car. But no sooner do these clowns manage to mount a dirty sneak attack than they're being riddled with machine gun fire. They're incompetent.The best example of The Family's incompetence is during the sequence when they try to burn Neville at Dodger Stadium. Somehow he gets free and escapes via motorbike. Cue The Family trying to stop him and then being blinded by flares and smoke bombs. It burns! It burns! But the scene where Heston is going to be burnt at the stake is a good example of the heavy-handed Christian imagery that permeates the film. You see, germ warfare wipes out mankind during a conflict between China and Russia. All that's left are Heston (the last man on Earth), the albino Luddites who are infected and dying, and infected humans who appear normal but will eventually become albino Luddites. So therefore The Family takes it upon itself to burn Neville for mankind's sins. He'll sacrifice himself for a purer world, one free of the evils of technology. But would you believe it, even though he's tied to a cross like Jesus, he gets free.Then there's the film's final image. At the end, the head of The Family spears Neville and he slowly dies in a fountain, soaking in his own blood. And he dies while in the crucifixion pose. Neville is the world's saviour. With the vaccination he makes, he promises to resurrect mankind, thus making him a divine figure.In one scene an infected but still normally functioning girl even asks Neville whether he's god. He laughs it off. But to all intents and purposes, he is. He's the one who has the power over life and death. He chooses who lives and who doesn't. He's both saviour and destroyer, much like the Christian god of the Old Testament.But although it's nice that all of this stuff is included in the film, it doesn't rescue it from mediocrity. Sure it has some good ideas, but a lot of the film is uninspired or just poorly made.The opening sequence, for instance, which sees Neville driving around a deserted city is rendered laughable by the ridiculously cheery music. Here we have the end of the world and it's...jazzy. There's no threat. There's no feeling of despair or doom. It just indicates that this is going to be a jaunty, run of the mill 70s B-movie adventure. The score dates the film horribly.And then in the opening there's a moment when Neville gets himself a new car. He goes into a dealership, and after removing the calendar that taunts him with the promise of female flesh, we see the rotting skeleton of someone who worked in this place. It should be a jarring moment. It should be scary. But the film merrily goes on about its way, reassuring us that this is just going to be a bit of fluff.The only real moment of terror in the film is the existential terror Neville feels when he suddenly hears every payphone ringing as he wanders the lonely streets. This is the sort of thing I wish the film would focus on ? Neville is losing his mind and he's hearing things that aren't there. But although there are a few nice little details in the film, the feeling of desperation and isolation is immediately lost when The Family turn up so quickly. Plus they're far too human. Yeah they're a bit mad, talking like religious zealots, but you see worse on the Tube.Also detracting from the feeling of dread are the infected people who haven't gone mad yet. They pretty quickly relieve Neville of his loneliness. And the scene where Neville first encounters another normal person is unintentionally amusing. Neville walks around a clothes shop full of mannequins and then begins to hear something. When he turns around a new mannequin has arrived ? there's a black girl with a large afro pretending to be still. I guess if it were done right it could be quite creepy, but instead with the girl not being very good at keeping still it looks like the end of every Police Squad episode.Another disappointing element is Neville's relationship with The Family. When he kills three of them he talks of an 'end game' and of them losing three pawns. Therefore you get the feeling that the whole thing is a game to Neville ? The Family might be trying to kill him, but he needs them in order to remain functional; even though they attack his house every night and even though he has a huge machine gun on the roof, to kill the whole Family would finally render his life pointless and aimless. But although all of this is there, it soon gives way to goofy action scenes and a tedious love story ? no sooner have Chuck and the black girl escaped a deadly Luddite attack than they're rolling on the floor with Heston joking that he might have forgotten how to make love. Interesting plot elements continually and repeatedly make way for the familiar action/adventure beats.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Armageddon 70s style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film started in a disturbingly eerie way, Charlton Heston screaming at ringing telephones inside his own head, corpses strewn over a deserted city and cowled creatures mockingly calling to him as he sits alone in his fortress/home. So why does it all go so wrong? Well for a start the hooded plague victims that seem so spooky at the outset turn out to be a variety of seventies stereotypes with facepaint and by the time the film has progressed to Charlton falling in love and trying to save a band of children the whole film has become very banal. Its a shame because films about the end of the world should provide the emotional equivalent of a smack in the head with a sledgehammer. Unfortunately by the end of The Omega Man it felt more like a light slap on the cheek.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Omega" of '70's sci-fi apocalyptic thrillers, the "Alpha" of Chuck's post-'Moses' performances...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an eleven-year-old kid, I knew enough to discover what the meaning of the word "deconstruction" was. I could've probably even scoped out exactly how that word applied to Charlton Heston's career at the time, what with the double whammy of "Planet of the Apes" and "Soylent Green." But I wasn't concerned with any of that. I wanted to see the thrilling, chilling, totally out-there premise posited by the preview trailer of this film, and I was not to be disappointed.Fast-forward, three decades later. Now that I can apply a little "deconstruction" to the film as an adult, unearthing the honey-baked, Hormel-ready dialogue, the whiplash-inducing editing, the kitschy costumes and low-tech special effects and visuals; even with all of this, THE OMEGA MAN has lost none of its funky, frenetic charm for me, '70's relic or not.Maybe it has something to do with being rooted in a time I tend to associate with innocence and naievete that was still somewhat intact, despite the turbulence of times from which we were still emerging, but the same gooseflesh travels up and down my forearms with the opening notes of Ron Grainer's haunting score, mixing rock, jazz, folk, electronic and Baroque sounds in a way that few soundtracks have since, and I am helpless to escape its comic-book worthy spell.Robert Neville (Heston) is not just the last of a dying breed, he's the last of his kind, period. His arrogant, chauvinistic, materialistic, macho individualism is a by-product of the world that all but destroyed itself, but these are the only weapons he has at hand to maintain survival of his sanity, (with more conventional ones at the ready for threats that are a lot more substantial than demons of the mind.)Neville was one of the researchers working on a powerful virus that gave us the edge in terms of biological warfare, when the idiots in both D.C. and Moscow finally decided to start pushing buttons, thereby treating us all to what a bag of Orville Redenbacher feels like in a microwave at full power. When the hammer came down and he was almost 86'ed in a helicopter crash, it turns out that he was carrying the only antidote to the bug with him. With the rest of the world in a handbasket halfway to Lucifer's doorstep anyway, Neville's instinct for self-preservation wins out, and he injects himself.He may truly be "The Omega Man," but as the tagline warns, he's not alone. The few survivors of the plague are now photosensitive albino mutants, whose complexion makes Michael Jackson's look downright normal. Half-crazed, they have formed a tribal unit known as "The Family," led by a charismatic former national-news broadcaster named Matthias, (Anthony Zerbe), who has taken it upon himself to create a new religion, turning his diseased followers into a crazed Luddite army. Hiding from the deadly sun by day, rising vampire-like at night to continue their "holy mission"--to wipe out every trace of modern civilization from the earth, thereby acheiving cleasing and atonement for the destruction that made them what they are...at least in their own twisted rationale.At the top of their list of things to do: guess who?Neville will not go gently into their not-so-good night, however, and as their mission is to destroy him, so he makes it his to venture out during the day and repay them in kind, capturing the occasional "Family" member and trying to cure him, with no success.It is on these forays into the blasted city streets when Neville begins to suspect that there may be more than just himself and The Family skulking about...could there be more normal survivors?Luckily for him, the answer is yes. When his he-man hubris gets him in dutch with Matthias and Company, leave it to a guy named Dutch (Paul Koslo) and tough chick Lisa (Rosalind Cash) to get him out. Gratitude and amazement turn to grudging hope, when Dutch and Lisa lead him to their own little extended "Family" of normal kids, in the hopes that some of Neville's failed experiments with Matthias' crew will provide a cure for Lisa's younger brother, Richie (Eric Laneuville), who is slowly but surely succumbing to the virus' insidious effects.For those of you who have seen this as many times as I have, you know what happens from here. For those who haven't, I won't divulge any more of the plotline, but let you discover the quirky joys of this counterculture classic yourself. Heston is at his laconic best here, and commands the screen in ways that guys like Kevin Costner could take a few notes from, (and probably have.) As the world's last woman in a romance that develops in a matter-of-fact way that was extremely progressive for its time, Rosalind Cash was the perfect pick. Only Pam Grier could've gone her one better, but Pam had a destiny date with an admiring video store clerk-turned-filmmaker in her future...The Vincent Price version of this story, THE LAST MAN ON EARTH, made on an even lower budget several years earlier, was a lot more faithful to the source material from which both films were made, the classic Richard Matheson novel I AM LEGEND. But Vinnie Price is the one whom Anthony Zerbe must've taken his cues from as the megalomaniacal Matthias: he takes every word of the Corrington's overripe dialogue and sips it like a very expensive Chateau Lafitte, savoring the moments. Lip-smackin' good!Ron Grainer's one-of-a-kind score, which at moments recalls the more adventurous efforts of Barry, Goldsmith, Morricone and Schifrin, would itself become the inspiration for many composers later, (and rightfully so.) The haunting theme stuck with me for years afterward, even when the images did not.For the cheese factor that has been referred to in quite a few other reviews of this cult classic, I won't ever deny that it's there, but compared to many of the films made today in this same genre, not one of them has the earnest starkness of a single frame of MAN, in their whole, CGI-bloated, effects enhanced scenarios.If you haven't seen this in a while, by all means, take it out for a spin. You won't be sorry, and you'll even respect yourself in the morning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Modern Plague Doctor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Neville was a scientist who created an experimental vaccine to rid the world of a deadly plague virus spreading across the nation. Unfortunately his helicopter crashed, and while recovering he never had time to give the world his cure before most of it was wiped out. Now he is living in what was once New York City, and whereas he lives in the daylight trying to find new people still alive, his enemies lurk in the night, searching for him. They have somehow ended up albino and go blind in the light, and their leader, a former news reporter named Johnathan Matthias, has grouped them together as an organization that works to erase the 20th century, the industrial age, and to erase the very man they believe to be responsible for it all; despite the plague being released by the army during a war between Russia and China, they believe Neville to be responsible for their predicament. When Neville meets Lisa, along with a gang of people who are all still normal, he plans to escape to the country with them and try and rebuild a normal society.Omega Man came out in 1971, and was one of the first movies to show interracial romance (Neville and Lisa), very rebellious for that day and age. It was therefore revolutionary and a movie with no racism at all, and others soon followed. It was hard while watching the film to not pity Matthias and his gang of sick people, but at the same time they were blaming industry and progress on their dilemma. It was very interesting how they showed the contrast between Matthias the nerdy-looking news reporter, and Matthias the albino man leading a gang of homicidal and vengeful civilians. The acting was excellent, especially the roles of Neville, Dutch, Lisa and Matthias, as well the soundtrack was memorable and amazing.The Omega Man is a lesson for everyone, that stopping progress isn't the answer to peace, stopping hatred is the answer. I also recommend the movies Soylent Green (1973), Logan's Run (1976), Dawn of the Dead (1977) and Village of the Damned (1995).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Last Man Alive...Is Not Alone!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A plague has wiped out humanity, killing most and mutating others into creatures of the night. In a now empty city, there is one man who has survived uninfected and must go on surviving while holding onto to both his sanity and his life. That is the premise of The Omega Man, the 1971 adaptation of Richard Matheson's seminal science fiction novel I Am Legend. But what has made the film stand the test of time to the point that it has become something of a cult classic over the last forty plus years? Due to its premise, the film rest heavily on the strength of the performance of lead actor Charlton Heston. Heston makes a believable "last man on Earth" as Neville, a former scientist and military man who came up with an experimental vaccine against a bio-weapon turned plague, struggles to keep his sanity between sheer loneliness and the threat of his fellow "survivors" who wish his destruction. The script gives Heston plenty to work from "action hero" moments to comedic moments (such as a scene in a used car dealership early on) and even some fleeting touching moments as well. Indeed, his performance also helps to make some of the films cheesier lines and moments seem believable. Heston as Neville more or less carries half of the film (and more especially the opening fifteen to twenty minutes) by himself and he never fails to keep the viewer engaged and interested in what is happening.But thanks to the supporting cast, the film proves its tagline of "the last man alive...is not alone!" Leading it as it were is Anthony Zerbe as Matthias, a former TV anchorman turned leader of the group of mutated, nocturnal albino like plague survivors called "The Family" who seek to destroy Neville. Zerbe's performance is oddly compelling, almost theatrical at times, as he plays the role of a crazed cult leader to the hilt. Playing the proverbial "omega woman" is Rosalind Cash as Lisa, though her performance is very much hampered by the fact that the script makes her into a "Black Power" caricature and as result has become incredibly dated. Much the same can be said of the performances of Eric Laneuville as Richie and Lincoln Kilpatrick as Zachary. The results then are mixed but, despite the dating of some performances, they help to keep the film moving and interesting.The film also features some strong production values for its time as well. In particular, there are some highly effective shots of an emptied out Los Angeles done decades before CGI made it much easier to accomplish. Those shots are put to special use during the film's first half and, along with stock footage and a few scenes in a flashback depicting the plague, help to firmly place the viewer into the film's world (which being the 1970s might well date the film in some eyes but certainly not mine). While the makeup used for The Family might not be up to 21st century standards, it is surprisingly effective especially in a reveal about midway through. Then there's the score from British composer Ron Grainer which mixes a whole bunch of styles together both for better and worse but, given that Grainer was the composer behind such TV themes such as Doctor Who and The Prisoner, it's a score that is memorable if at times for the wrong reasons.Yet the thing that perhaps stands out most about the film, along with Heston's performance, is its script. Writers John William Corrington and Joyce H. Corrington loosely adapted Richard Matheson's seminal science fiction novel I Am Legend and updated it somewhat for the early 1970s. For those who know the source material, there are many differences (such as the fact that Matheson's novel was a vampire story done in a science fiction context which, by Joyce H. Corrington's own admission on a DVD special feature, was something they dumped very quickly) but also some things brought from the novel into the film as well. The film then takes the bare bones of Matheson's novel, adding some action sequences, and very much does its own thing.The results of that are compelling. There are some fascinating subtexts going on in the film such as Neville's struggle to preserve a last vestige of civilization against the barbaric, nocturnal albino Family who see the world as it was, and therefore Neville, as evil (as Matthias describes Neville at one point: "One creature, caught. Caught in a place he cannot stir from in the dark, alone, outnumbered hundreds to one, nothing to live for but his memories, nothing to live with but his gadgets, his cars, his guns, gimmicks... and yet the whole family can't bring him down?") There's also an interesting quasi-Biblical subtext going on as well that becomes almost blatantly obvious at times during the back half of the film and especially in its final scene (this was an element that the much later adaptation of Matheson's novel starring Will Smith used quite heavily). That all being said parts of the script, like the film as a whole, have also dated horribly especially its African-American characters and some of its dialogue, something that as noted above hampers a few of the performances. For those faults though it is the script, both in its events and thematic, that makes the film compelling and entertaining.In the final analysis, The Omega Man then is an interesting film that has earned a cult status. Like many films after four decades it has become dated and cheesy in places. Yet the performance of Charlton Heston and its script, with its very loose adaptation of a classic sci-fi novel combined with some compelling subtexts, has also given it the ability to stand the test of time. The result, mixed though those are at times, is ninety-eight entertaining and at times thought provoking, minutes.</fullReview>

This film puts you in that world and as a child it scared the hell out of me. I enjoyed the crazy outfits and Lisa was very hot. Charlton Heston made about 5 great Science Fiction flicks and this and of course the Planet of the Apes are my favorites. The people who are ripping this film forget it was the early 70's . There will never be another Charlton Heston and I watch this film at least 5 times a year to take me back to that world and time in my childhood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania.I wanted to see "Omega Man" after watching "I am legend" - i loved that one very much. "Omega Man" is a little different movie, and not just in terms of a movie making. Although it was made in 1971 it looks very good. The empty city looks really cool, i wonder how in the heck they did this back in 1971 with no CGI and stuff like that. I was quite surprised of that, can only imagine how it looked in 1971 when there weren't "Avatar" and flick's like that.Charlton Heston is just Charlton Heston in this one. I think W.Smith did a better job of portraying an isolated man in mega city. Ending was good, but a little "overdone". And there are some shocking scenes in "Omega Man".9/10. Good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best execution of its story but still a good science-fiction movie to watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man, I'm totally watching these movies in the wrong order. First I had seen "I Am Legend", then I watched this movie and I still haven't seen the 1964 Vincent Price movie version. But none of this seems to really matter though, since each movie seems to be a different interpretation of the Richard Matheson novel.This movie version seems to focus more on the religious aspects than anything else really. At the same time this is also what's making this movie less interesting and less effective to watch. It just never fully works out and never seems able to reach the full potential with its story. Because of this the movie is lacking in tension and also in mystery. And what exactly got resolved and explained about this movie its story in the end? Not that much really, which makes this a bit of a redundant movie to watch.But of course the movie is still being more than just that. I works still on plenty of other levels. The main concept of the movie is still being great and fascinating for a movie within its genre, even though it didn't got executed in the best way imaginable. It's eerie to see the desolated streets of a big city and the movie does definitely have the right required atmosphere in it. I just wish that the 'villains' and their motivations were being a bit stronger and that they themselves were being a bit more scary and threatening. It would had given the movie so much more.You could also really say that Charlton Heston was already looking a bit too old to play this sort of 'heroic' action role, even though he wasn't even 50 yet at the time. But at the same time his presence is still adding a lot to this movie and without him this movie would had probably disappeared into obscurity. He still handled the same sort of role much better in the later futuristic and post-apocalyptic science-fiction movie "Soylent Green".All in all this movie is not being the best or most interesting execution of the story imaginable but the movie in itself still remains a good watch, especially for the lovers of 'realistic' science-fiction movies, that put its emphasis on the science.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's difficult not to like this dated (no pun intended) sci-fi classic concerning the 'last man' on earth and his efforts to rekindle the human race with his immunity from the germ warfare that brought about its decline. Heston is the Messiah-like Dr Neville, a military bio-chemist whose trial serum he manages to inject following a helicopter crash. He survives the accident and the plague, but is dogged by the undead, a family of puritanical albinos, preaching the virtues of primitive life trying desperately to erase Neville and his legacy of greed and technology that ended the world. Zerbe is at his tyrannical best as the anchorman turned family patriarch Matthias, equal in standing as Heston's slightly maniacal nemesis.When Neville learns that there may be others not affiliated with the family, he decides to farm his blood cells and create the antidote to society, but Matthias is not interested in revisiting the past and a bloody encounter ensues.Far superior to both Vincent Price's "Last Man on Earth" and the more recent re-imagining "I Am Legend", film buffs might be a little disappointed to learn that cult actors John Dierkes, DeVeren Bookwalter and Anna Aries all have insignificant bit parts; in point of fact, none of them are particularly recognisable beneath their monk robes, pale complexions and dark shades. The musical score is memorable, the sets colourful and the film is a stark depiction of mankind's last days, and also an at times touching nostalgia that is hard to resist. Religious allegory, a profoundly dated timepiece ... in the context of a Heston vehicle, it still ticks all the boxes and should appeal to sci-fi fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not really know why, but this movie really rocks - it has great atmosphere, really cool performance by Charlton Heston and it was very enjoyable. I was satisfied as much, as it was possible.I do however, have a doubts with calling this 'an adaptation' of the novel 'I am Legend'. There is no real connection - many elements were present in the book, but others were altered or added - and, in my opinion, those changes went that deep, that this movie stands on his own. Overall idea is other for the movie and for the novel. It is very hard to make a one-actor movie for 2 hours. That what is great in the novel, doesn't necessary look so good in the movie. That is completely different type of media.But for adapting the idea itself - About a regular guy fighting alone with the nations of creatures he doesn't fully understand - it comes closer than 2007 movie.So movie is great, give it a watch, but read the book afterwords - you'll be still surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that killed the Afro Haircut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is kind of interesting in a number of ways. The Second adaptation of Richard Matheson's "I am Legend", it stars Charlton Heston as the title character, a scientist who has built himself a fortress. The portrayal of the monsters is interesting. Matheson wrote them as classic vampires, including in his narrative scientific explanations as to why they would be repelled by crosses and garlic. Vincent Price's version (The last Man on Earth) kept it in that vein. The more recent Wil Smith vehicle made the afflicted more of a cross between Orcs and Zombies, with a hint of CGI in them. In Heston's version, the creatures are more like the mutants of "Beneath the Planet of the Apes", taking on the quasi-religious nature of the latter group. Very daring, especially for 1971. Even more daring was the interracial sex scene between Heston and Rosalind Cash. (Would never get past the censors today, but it only merited the film a PG rating!) The violence is also very graphic for the time. There was a period in the early 70's where producers could show blood and breasts, and enjoyed the heck out of it for a few years before the MPAA clamped down. Some parts of the film are definitely dated, like the zombies with Afro Haircuts (which quickly fell out of fashion after this film. Co-incidence? I think not!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty cool flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Richard Matheson book "I Am Legend" has been done to death on the big screen and none of them does the great book justice although Vincent Price's "The Last Man on Earth" comes pretty close.This movie is pretty good but it doesn't hold too closely to the book.Charleton Heston plays Robert Neville, a scientist who is trying to find a way to stop people from dying from a biological war agent that has been released upon the world.He gives himself a last minute experimental vaccine that saves him and he ends up being the last man alive or at least the last normal man.Neville shares the city with people who haven't been outright killed but are taking a while to die ...they can't stand light and they are pale and have sores and seem to be screwed up in the head.They form something of a cult and tend to think they have a right to purge the earth of all human life that isn't like themselves...sort of like the NRA and Heston in his final years,huh? So anyway these weirdos hunt Neville at night and he hunts them during the day.This isn't a great movie but it is pretty good.It will hold your interest to the end.In the features on the DVD they talk to the screenwriter,a woman,her and her husband had written the screenplay and she really irritated me by sort of pooh poohing the book acting as though her treatment of it was so much better.Ha! What a joke...in fact the main reason why this movie wasn't better is because it strayed so far from the book.Heston is good ,although no one would ever consider him a great actor.He was a bit hammy ,as usual ,in places but he is also pretty cool overall here.Read the book by all means before you watch any of the numerous movies based upon it.It's a very good read!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heston in his prime element</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heston passed away the day before I sat watching this film for the first time for 25 years. Heston was the ultimate definition of giant mega-star presence and a master of lines delivery that seems to emanate from his chest. Though he has played biblical heroes to iconic effect, I feel that he excels most as the arrogant, stubborn hero/anti-hero. This is such a role and is a tour de force for this giant of an actor. Although set in an apocalyptic future, this movie has everything 70s stamped all over it (made in 1971) including some laughable jive talk from Heston "come on, baby" but all the better for it as this was the decade of heightened paranoia, rebellion and cult factions. This film captures all those elements despite its apocalyptic setting. There are moments of excitement but it is ultimately a riveting one man show which only an actor of Heston's calibre can pull off. I am sure Tom Hanks terrific performance in Castaway was influenced by this. The film's narrative is smartly done with the use of flashbacks and a captivating storyline making this highly enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You dig the vibe? Yes it's a psychedelically offbeat, easy going apocalyptic Sci-fi / action hybrid led by a stone-like, but trendy action hero portrayal by Charlton Heston and a prominent budget. The ham-fisted premise is taken off Richard Matheson's novel "I Am Legend", and was the second feature to be based upon it. The first was the considerably dreary little Italian-made "The Last Man on Earth (1964)" starring the always charismatic Vincent Price. What strikes a chord early on, is the ultra-fashionable 70's style that really does date this cult insured film. The key is the way it begins, as it truly sets the mood superbly. We open with a quiet, arid Los Angeles ghost town and we feel the depressing solitude of Heston's character take shape. The tempo of the story is quite mellow, and purposely steady as John William and Joyce H. Corrington's unconventionally enterprising screenplay is thoughtfully literate, and filled with symbolic themes and powerful images (just look at the film's closing shot). But there's no escaping its campy origins, and the script cops the brunt of it. Some details feel ridiculous, and a tad grandeur than they should. I found the inclusion of the other (unaffected) characters kind of takes away the important construction of Heston's character, and maybe even the chilling side-effects waiting to break out. The only real major gripe I had was the pacing could get rather sluggish, but director Boris Segal's accessible direction delivered the goods when it came to the action set-pieces, filming the exteriors with its available scope and generating some surprises. Even though there's hope found within the story, it's extremely gloomy and finds a few moments to get down n' nasty with its violence. Russell Metty's poignantly atmospheric cinematography is great, and Ron Grainer's beat-inducing, cosy music score is well oiled. The make-up effects of the albino mutants (who replace the vampires of the original and are known as "The Family") is ghastly, unique and very 70's. Gotta love the shades, and their hooded robes. The performances are really good. Heston carries lot of the weight, and chisels out a subtle but strongly evocative character performance. To cash in on the Blaxploitation market, a feisty Rosalind Cash is cast along side Heston. Anthony Zerbe reeks with cunning menace as the manipulative, preachy leader of "The Family" and there's a short part for a lively Paul Koslo. Messy and unusual, but extremely groovy fun despite some heavy-handed currents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When movies didn't have to have a happy ending...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit that this is one of my favourite old "apocalypse" movies. Uniquely for the time it didn't postulate a nuclear holocaust ending civilization, but instead the relatively unknown concept of biological warfare.The movie looks aged and tired now, but the story, seen as a whole still has merit. The acting isn't great and perhaps the casting of Charlton Heston as the lead might have been re-thought, but its fairly entertaining nonetheless.There are a lot of messages hidden away in this movie. The most startling (again for the time) is the notion that, at the end of the world, it doesn't matter what colour you are. This is portrayed by the sufferers of the disease that wiped out mankind, who are uniformly bleached white. Interesting stuff in those days, as was Heston's romance with a black woman. Not something that you saw much of in the movies and TV of the day.The music is a bit weird for the most part, but comes good during the action sequences with a stirring refrain. It has a VERY 70's sound to it and probably dates the movie more than anything else.There are a few things I didn't get about the story. For instance, if Heston's character is pestered nightly by the Brotherhood, why doesn't he just move home? I know he wants to try and help them but....All in all a fair movie, with a good ending (not a Hollywood one) and worthy of a watch if there's nothing better on.EDIT: Pay attention to the long shots of the city at the start. Although supposedly deserted you can, in more than one, see cars going across intersections in the distance and people walking across gaps between buildings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>nobody asked for a religious film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The screenwriters and the director of this film probably didn't look into the book I Am Legend. Maybe they did a little, but why did they have to make an allegory of the Spanish Inquisition. There are some very action packed moments in this movie but some of it is very stupid. We see Charlton Heston flying in a helicopter in one part and all of a sudden we see his pilot looking like he's having a seizure. He is really dying from the plague. Then Charlton Heston tries to control the Helicopter and we see him start to die of the plague. The helicopter goes out of control and we see it crash and burn with Heston inside. In the next shot we see him crawling all bloody on the ground. I don't know why the beginning is such a comedy. The subject is very serious. In the book I Am Legend Neville loses his wife, daughter and friend to the plague and by the way, the plague wasn't caused by biological warfare with China and Russia. In the book I Am Legend and in it's first movie we have the last man on earth hunting down the vampires and driving stakes through there hearts. In Omega Man we're lucky if Neville kills any. In the morning instead of going after vampire he's jogging down the street in a stupid jogging outfit. I Am Legend is so different from this movie it's not even funny. It's like the filmmakers fooled the producers into thinking they were going to make a Sci Fi movie and instead made an apocalyptic movie about the Spanish Inquisition and what's worse they only got the character's name in the book right! Why even call him Neville if it's not even the same story. No matter what the filmmakers got right the movie is still an allegory and still religious. In one scene a little girl that survived asked Heston if he was god. Spoiler In the end when Heston meets his fate in a gory way he is scene in the final shot of the movie lying in a pool of his own blood positioned like Jesus Christ. If I ever find the director or the screenwriter I'm going to punch him in the face for the allegory and that last shot.But if you are able to overlook the movie as being religious and if you haven't read the book I Am Legend you'll probably enjoy it. But trust me. Read I Am Legend. If you have, see the Vincent Price adaptation Last Man On Earth. I've read on the web that they are making a movie called I Am Legend. It might star Will Smith if Arnold Schwarzenegger doesn't keep the role. We'll have to wait and see. I hope they get it right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually, Chuck ISN'T the last man on earth...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this on a local-TV Sunday matinee as a kid and bawling my eyes out at the end, when Chuck Heston gets impaled on a sharp stick. Yup, it was that traumatic.Years later I saw it again (on a local-TV late movie show) it was the beginning twenty minutes or so (and the first ten) that transfixed me. The scenes of an eerily deserted Los Angeles circa 1971 (and those cool brand new 1971 Fords) were some of the most effective I'd seen up to that point, and are still incredible.It is only when the other players are introduced that The Omega Man starts it's descent into cheese. First comes perennial Mission: Impossible bad guy Anthony Zerbe and his black-robed, white-faced Family, who are such a bunch of hams that it's impossible to take them really seriously. They speak in a convoluted pseudo-liturgical lingo that reminds one of too many bad movies about witchcraft, and they gleefully chant "More! More books! Burn them all!" while pillaging a library. Then we realize that Heston is NOT in fact the last untainted human on the planet. Why, right nearby is a bunch of VERY HIP looking and sounding hippies, with enough heavy ordinance to wage their own jihad against The Man. Leader of this counter-Family is tough chick Rosalind Cash, who if one squints at could pass for Pam Grier. That means several things in terms of the movie: Chuck now has a love interest (a then-racy interracial one at that!), there are more people to fight/be killed, Chuck now has someone to chat with besides himself and his bust of Caesar, and the movie as a whole loses almost all its steam. The lonely fight for survival promised in the opening minutes becomes diluted when Chuck has all this help, you know?I've never read Matheson's original story, so I can't comment on how true the screenplay is to it. I can say that it seems to go out of its way to make all the good guys sound hip, and the baddies sound like monks gone amuck. Occasionally clever, occasionally dumb, but not very realistic in any case. Chuck's sneering one-liners aimed at no one in particular eventually gets on your nerves, although he does deliver yet another in a long line of Classic Heston Shouts: "There is no phone ringing, dammit!!!" I really do wish they had explored Heston's and Zerbe's characters more, their contradictary natures and their not-so-hidden madness, and the moral questions represented by "good guy" Heston, a former Army doctor who carries a machine gun, and "bad guy" Zerbe, driven by self-righteous rage against "the tools that destroyed the world." And dumped the hippie family. But then how would they have sold the movie to the public?Ron Grainer's score isn't half bad on its own merits, and even fits in certain places. But most of the time it reminds me of a contemporary made-for-TV movie, is often just plain inappropriate, and works against the basic concept of the movie, that the world is dead except for one man and these hooded hobgoblins. I'd have done away with the score completely. Russell Metty's cinematography, however, is high quality in that old-school workmanlike way.Okay, so The Omega Man is cheezball early '70s post-apocalypse. That isn't to say it's a bad story, or is morally invalid, or whatever. As we are seeing now, it is all too relevant, even if the bad guys aren't Russians or Red Chinese. It was a good story told poorly, or at least carelessly. Worth a look, as long as you aren't expecting more than a local-TV Sunday matinee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chuck tries to shed his "holy" image</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Heston rants, saunters, sneers, and essentially establishes his credits for his upcoming "role" as head of the NRA. Considering it was made so early in the 70's, this flick practically borders on blackploitation, particularly Chuck's interracial sex scenes.The producers decided to stick with a simpler concept that that of Matheson's original "I Am Legend," which was probably a wise decision: the general viewing public just ain't ready for Matheson. In return, it's a bit more topical, which doesn't hurt it one bit.Heston is adequate, and Anthony Zerbe is ominous as always. Rosalind cash is eye candy, and the rest of the cast is adequate.More effective is the setting, and the vast deserted LA (despite the occasional flaws - could anybody else really do this better?). Overlooked here so far is Ron Grainer's pounding musical score: the guy who brought you Doctor Who and The Prisoner's theme music scores again (in more ways than one)! There's an adequate series of action sequences, and the ending is neatly symbolic.Overall, I'd recommend the movie. It's still a bit dated, but decent s.f. thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe that (back in 1971) $9 million was a substantial sized budget for any Hollywood film - And, yet, (with the exception of a few fiery explosions, thrown in for good measure) I couldn't, for the life of me, see where all that money was spent in The Omega Man. (The make-up effects, in particular, really sucked, big-time) Yep. If you ask me - The Omega Man was one of the leanest-looking, big-budget productions (from the early-1970s) that I've ever seen. Believe me, this one was a prime example of amateur movie-making on all counts.On top of all the inferiority that prevailed in The Omega Man (as well as all of the unintentional humour that punctuated the story) - I found that I just couldn't take this Sci-Fi tale at all seriously. (Its dire message of worldwide plague was less than convincing and, overall, handled in a very dull-edged fashion) And, speaking about actor Charlton Heston - Is this dreary, no-talent, lunkhead really considered to be one of the Hollywood greats of yesteryear? Is he really!? Anyway - Regardless of the fact that The Omega Man was adapted for the screen from Richard Matheson's story "I Am Legend" - I swear that they were actually making up this nonsense as they went along. From start to finish - The Omega Man completely disgraced Matheson's story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I´ve expected so much out of it. And a man should expect much from a movie based on a such cult horror literature classic as Richard Matheson´s "I AM LEGEND", which is still one of the best sci-fi apocalyptic horrors ever written. So, the movie came as a pretty big disapointment. Not that it´s not watchable, it certainly has it´s moments of quality, but they are by far outnumbered by huge script mistakes. They thrown away almost every important and the most frightening aspects of Matheson´s book,living us only with post-apocalyptic tensions and nothing else. Charlton Heston is very good in his role, but it wont do a movie any justice. And it´s still a mystery to me why they did it like this. Shame, real shame.</fullReview>

When the TV listings show a Charlton Heston movie from the seventies that you haven't seen, you make sure that you catch it. The opening scene isn't terribly exciting, BUT, it you can turn off this movie after hearing the opening music (source and score) well shame on you! You probably don't like any movies from the seventies. They don't make movies like this anymore. It's not slick, and it's not polished. It's just a movie. The laserdisc version has a VERY badly done featurette about the making of the movie, but it's great because you don't see much of that kind of stuff from the seventies.

		<shortDescription>Prophetic parable of our time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Omega man may now receive renewed attention as a result of the current and third re-make of the original story from which it derives, "I Am Legend".Whilst "I Am Legend" may well be more faithful to the original book, that text, however, is an unremarkable piece of escapist sci-fi. Whereas The Omega Man, using the story as a vehicle, developed it into what may now be read as an uncannily insightful analysis of latent undercurrents of late twentieth century culture.The Omega Man replaces the rather puerile vampire theme with that of a reactionary cult of anti-science. The epidemic that supposedly turns people into blood-sucking Buffy-beasts in the original story is replaced by a rather more believable illness of which symptoms are aversion to light and insanity. A TV news anchorman, using the technology of mass communications that science has put at his disposal, is shown as opportunistically exploiting the biological disaster to create a religious cult that entirely renounces science, with himself as its head.Aspects of this scenario reflected elements within the "hippy" movement that was nearly contemporaneous with the movie's making. The nascent "Luddite" reactionary element that was in hippiedom has swelled in prominence in the years since the movie was made, as the less harsh themes of Sixties "counter-culture", libertarianism and the renunciation of top-down political dogma, have evaporated. Today, in the mature, even decadent technological societies, the principal themes of culture and politics are a renunciation of science and the reassertion of mediaeval religious dogmas. These two elements frequently intertwine. Whilst the "environmentalist" political dogma seeks to dictate from above every aspect of everyday life for every citizen, the state has launched into a millennial conflict with renascent mediaevalist religion as it is expressed overseas in "terrorist" movements.Seen from today's perspective, Charlton Heston's depiction of the isolated, besieged man of science, Dr Neville, seems eerily evocative for the embattled minority of us who cling to the ideal of scientific truth that is now under attack. As in The Omega Man, we now see the mass media that is a product of science used by that media's own opportunistic elements to generate a hostility to science that they can then play to their own advantage. We have reached the point at which to dare raise the pseudo-scientific nature of the dominant political ideology that is environmentalism is to risk being rendered an outcast, like Neville.A far-fetched fantasy adventure at the time of it's making, The Omega Man now seems to have uncannily anticipated the major political themes of life in the early Twenty-First Century. A truly prophetic parable of our times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>post-apocalyptic quasi-guilty pleasure that's better for Heston fans than those looking for I Am Legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got what I wanted out of the Omega Man, though if it were a better made movie then I might feel the need to add it to my collection as opposed to sending it back as a rental. It starts off with a very funny and terrifically surreal set-up as Charleton Heston drives around in a red convertible, no one else in the city, with an 8-Track playing muzak. Suddenly, he stops in front of a building, sees something moving around behind the window, and takes out his machine gun firing off some rounds at the figure. Bizarre enough? How about when he stops off at a movie theater, which has "held over" the documentary Woodstock, as Heston reels up the film in the projection room and watches it for what must be the 10th time (he talks along with one of the interviewees at one point). So far in the film it's deliciously ambiguous as to what the hell is going on, aside from Heston being the only guy in a deserted city (LA) with a machine gun and love for the Woodstock film. Deep down, I knew that the story would soon have to unfold, but I wonder how classic the film could be if it continued on this experimental track of mind.The story then unfolds, and it's sort of hit or miss as far as 70s (pre-Star Wars, post Planet of the Apes) science fiction goes. A group known as the "family" survivors of a nuclear holocaust who go around in black robes looking like monks with pale faces and completely white pupils, are after Heston's ex-scientist, who somehow got a vaccine together for himself before the plague went totally widespread. He has a good hold-up in a penthouse, with an amusing bust of an old general he talks to and a big TV/mirror he uses for narcissistic purposes. Did I mention the guns? Lots of them; one wonders if scenes from this film are ever shown at NRA conventions (ironically though, the scene where he shoots a monk who's somehow crawled his way up to the penthouse, was in Bowling for Columbine for a moment, which adds to it being unintentionally hilarious when it comes around). Soon though once the more strange parts of the film give way to the more typical ones; the other survivors, not the 'family' but some group who somehow didn't get infected (though could), bring Heston into the fold, though with some mixed results. Chiefly that our hero gets to bed down with a foxy black lady with a huge afro, and one of the kids infected, who gets cured, stupidly (more-so stupidly plot-wise) tries to convince the 'family' that they can be cured too, which is the last thing on their minds.As an action film, it's surprisingly not as intense as I imagined from hearing the bits of hype and seeing clips from the film. True, it's a lot of fun seeing Heston chew on the dialog and give just a look, or a laugh, and make it worthwhile as some typical Heston machismo, and if there is a situation involving lots of half-dead fellows with wicked intentions it's a sure-fire bet to have a guy like him around. But the story around it seems too undercooked- this is from someone who has yet to read Matheson's book- or rather not appropriately enough in ambiguity while at the same time not really raising any questions like the much more successful Planet of the Apes did. When it comes down to it, The Omega Man is a neat time capsule, especially for those who want to see Heston kick ass and sort of take names (and maybe just to watch it for all the ironic reasons of a nut like Heston being president of the NRA- fantasy for him, who knows). Just don't go looking for a landmark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unwise monkeying with a great book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of these days, maybe even in my lifetime, someone will make a great movie based on the classic vampire book "I Am Legend." So far, we've had two brave attempts, but no cigar (as they say). This is the weaker of those two attempts.The whole point of Matheson's book is that Neville is utterly isolated, but this film undermines any sense of loneliness by giving Heston a sort of hippie community (not to mention some rather chatty antagonists). That said, there are a few effective moments of isolation, particularly when Heston is cruising around the deserted city, poking his head into eerily deserted department stores. But these effective bits are all atmosphere; the plot itself, the actual backbone of the movie, doesn't hold up.The film also has its fair share of production problems, including obvious stunt doubling for Heston in the motorcycle scene and a bouncy-happy-fun-totally crap music score by Ron Grainer. Heston himself is okay - but I think Leonard Maltin's assessment that he trumps Vincent Price's performance in the first version is all wet. Price played the character as someone in obvious mental agony; Heston almost seems to be having fun fighting these creatures. His fancy digs are part of this unwise trend towards making Neville too cool and too comfortable. He ought to be bedraggled, weary, at death's door...but he doesn't look it, here.I don't mean to suggest that the film is a dud. It's fun on a number of levels, and I enjoyed Zerbe's wacky acting (astute film-goers will note that, in a ton of Zerbe's movies, something happens that messes up his character's face - isn't that strange?). But there is still a much better, definitive version of "I Am Legend" waiting to be made. And when it does get made, I do hope it's about vampires and not zombies or diseased cultists - blood, and matters of blood, are at the heart of the story, after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best post-apocalyptic movie I have seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man, this movie is cool! I always imagine myself in Heston's place when I see it, as I'm sure most people with any spirit, taste or sense do. Storing up goods and ammo and trinkets for his house, battling the crazed mutants, falling in love, doing it his way, this is big time entertainment. If you don't get it, well, you don't get it. Go put an antenna ball on your car or some beads on your rear-view mirror or something. Just don't screw up this great movie for the rest of us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant film, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...I can't help wondering if it was savaged in the cutting room.I have watched this film many times, having been captivated by it shortly after it was released. It is so many things - great SF/apocalyptic story line (both significantly different to, and better than, the book), action film, and window on everything that was 1971 - the clothes, the hair (!) and the music.The more I see it, however, the more I feel that it was originally much longer. Many scenes feel truncated, with the dramatic tension suffering as a result. A particular example is the scene which takes Heston off in search of the teenager who has gone to "save" Mathias and his loons and which provides the link to the final scene. This feels like it should have been much longer, his battle to return home much tougher.If anyone knows if the original was intended to be longer I would be very interested to hear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really like apocalyptic plots, especially when they are rather close to reality. This film showed a nightmare that could well happen in the near future. By not preparing an obvious ending and adding a few turning points, the movie managed to draw me into a tense atmosphere. The flashbacks to earlier times caused a fateful ambience. Even though there were a couple of mistakes in the set, I couldn't help being very frightened until the end. And the end was different to what I expected... but hey, I am no horror geek. This is not the best movie I have ever seen, but it is a good one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Omega Man, along with another Heston film round the same time, Soylent Green, is one of the worst made films I have ever seen in my life. This film can only be regarded as true camp, as the film was taken fairly seriously when it was made, and has strong moral implications, but the results betray the seriousness and implications implied. Even more disturbing than the low quality of the movie itself is the movie's original musical soundtrack score done by Ron Granier. I'm a big fan of Granier's work for Steptoe &amp; Son, Dr. Who, The Prisoner, etc., but his score for The Omega man is simply atrocious; it's as though he was scoring for a completely different film altogether, as well as different scenes.As a campy, low budget, Sci-Fi B film, The Omega Man is entertaining enough because of its star, Charleton Heston, and because of the interesting story that it tells, but don't expect much more than terrible effects, terrible acting, terrible directing, and terrible music. Of course, some people really seem to revel in low quality films like this, so it doesn't surprise me that this is one of those midnight movie cult favourites that is praised by awkward sci-fi geeks who more than likely peed their trousers in primary school.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie might be considered a forefather movie to today's zombie craze. It has some great ideas Sci Fi and of course Charlton Heston starring. I liked that once an agent released, the fact that there are/were other "enemy" countries becomes meaningless. This is essential understand about dooomsday weapons - that they're implicated uses may far beyond any control factors. The music is period-awful though, and the sets and costuming remind the viewer more of the original Batman show with Adam West rather than some post-apocalyptic world. The vacant shots with a 1969/70 Los Angeles are fairly competent despite that. Another head-scratcher was the warped-hippie-pseudo-religious cult. "The family" was period lost on me as harmlessly inept, unworthy of antagonism. Still I liked Heston perceived loneliness, and joy as he found purpose with other survivors. Better than the newer "I am Legend"... 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just wanted to see a decent adaptation of the Richard Matheson novel "I am legend". I have seen "The Last Man on Earth" which is captivating with its similarity to the novel and its simplicity countered by Vincent Price's acting, it was a very good counterpart to the novel. The omega man,on the other hand, is everything the novel is not. When you see Charlton Heston grabbing a gun, you know it is going to be a) personal b)action filled. The story is not about vampires but about an albino cult that forbids modern technology. Too bad for them, Ben Hur has an arsenal at his disposal and makes short work of the post apocalyptic band, movie is over. Although I might add Anthony Zerbe has charisma as the creepy looking leader and the action scenes are decent enough, it is a shame to adapt the novel like this and leave its main focus out of the picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have loved this film since my early childhood. Granted, it is very dated, being produced in the sad dawn of the '70s . . . but if you can get past the attire and slang it is a well crafted movie, based on a good story line. Heston gives his usual strong performance, and the musical score by Ron Grainer is second to none. Considering the era in which this film was made the special effects have nothing to apologize for, and the acting by supporting cast was above average for the time.I recommend this film. For us baby boomers the dated aspects of the work can be easily understood and ignored, and for the tender young ones among us there is enough flash/bang/eerie stuff to hold interest - as I've seen demonstrated by the reaction of my kids to this movie.There is sexual content, and brief nudity (all tame by current standards) which should be edited on the fly for little ones, as the parent sees fit. I don't know where on the ratings chart this film would fit in the modern era.</fullReview>

He found a vaccine and is the only one who can benefits from it. He fought two years after that , the victims of the disease who are now trying to "purify" the earth of the old fashion humanity.As with almost all movies made with the NRA president and spokesman, there is guns and shooting involved, to kill the "vampires".The script holds together, and is realistic in a tactical way.

		<shortDescription>Interesting but Flawed Christian Allegory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains SpoilersThe post-apocalyptic thriller was a popular science-fiction sub-genre during the Cold War, and 'The Omega Man' is a good example. The normal premise of such films is that some disaster has wiped out almost the entire population of the world; in this case, the disaster is a plague caused by the use of biological weapons in a war between China and the Soviet Union. The central figure is Dr Robert Neville, a military research scientist, who has survived thanks to an experimental vaccine. He, however, is virtually the only human to have survived unaffected; the plague has killed the majority of the population and turned most of the surviving minority into strange light-sensitive albinos. These albinos, who have banded together in a tribe called 'the Family', are sometimes referred to as 'zombies', but that is not quite accurate, as the term 'zombie' implies a mindless automaton. The albinos have, in fact, retained some intelligence; indeed, they have a relatively sophisticated system of beliefs. They hate Neville because he is different from them, having been unaffected by the plague, and because they see him as a representative of the corrupt old scientific, industrialised world. (It is a central article of their creed that God sent the plague as a punishment for the sins of that world). The film opens with some striking, eerie shots of Neville driving through the streets of a deserted Los Angeles, followed by scenes in which he has to fight off the frenzied attacks of the Family. Although he is one man against many, Neville has several advantages. The Family's sensitivity to light means that they can only come out during the night, and their hatred of technology means that they have renounced the use of the firearms that he uses against them with great effect. While not fighting, Neville sits in his apartment (which he has decorated with artworks taken from museums, playing chess with himself) or goes to the cinema where he watches endless showings of 'Woodstock' with the sardonic comment 'They don't make films like that any more'. Neville discovers that there is another group of survivors in the area, mostly young people, at risk from both the Family and from the virus. He falls in love with one of this group, a young woman named Lisa, and tries to help them to survive. He discovers that his blood contains antibodies, which can be used to produce fresh supplies of the vaccine. Neville is eventually killed in a fight with the Family, but not before he has given his blood to bring hope to the world. In his very readable autobiography 'In the Arena' Charlton Heston informs us that the famous final shot, in which the body of the dying Neville is seen in an attitude normally associated with the crucified Christ, was a late idea on his part, not in the original script. Even without this scene, however, the film's Christian overtones would be unmistakable; Neville is a Christ-figure whose giving of his blood to save the world is symbolic of the Christian doctrine of Christ's redemptive sacrifice. There is, however, also criticism of some elements of religious doctrine; the ideology of the Family (who wear robes similar to monastic habits) has much in common with the doctrines of intolerant, exclusivist sects. The film can also be seen as an anti-racist parable; one of the reasons why the Family hate Neville is because he is different to them both in his ways and in his physical appearance. Neville is white and Lisa black; their inter-racial romance must have seemed very daring for the early seventies. (Heston, although he has a reputation as one of Hollywood's most politically conservative figures, was always liberal on racial issues). Despite its interesting themes, the film has a number of weaknesses. Neville shows rather too much relish in gunning down his enemies to be wholly convincing as a Christ-figure. The acting is not distinguished, and this is not one of Heston's better performances. Neville starts off as a cynic and ends up as a symbol rather than a person; there is no real attempt to show the loneliness, fear and despair that would surely be the lot of a man in his position. It is never satisfactorily explained why Neville does not attempt to use his car and his supplies of petrol to flee Los Angeles, or at least to escape from the Family who are trying to kill him. (The answer is presumably that he stays put because the plot requires it). This is still an interesting film, but one which I felt could have been a lot better. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They killed Chuck! Again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlton Heston seems to have a habit of dying in science fiction films. He died in "Beneath the Planet of the Apes" (and Tim Burton's ill-gotten remake of "Planet of the Apes" where he ironically cameos as an ape), he presumably dies in "Soylent Green" and he dies here. Heston - whom, if you catch him at the right angle, looks like a more slender version of Arnold Schwarzenegger - excelled in films like "Ben-Hur" and "The Ten Commandments" but he occasionally feels out of place in films that are set elsewhere. Here, he feels kind of like Han Solo (who knows, maybe he was the inspiration for Han Solo, along with James Dean) but at least he appears to be having fun in a few scenes.As others have pointed out, this film is quite cheesy and it's action sequences aren't quite as exciting as they should be. One of the few things that actually grabbed me was when we saw the brother of Rosalind Cash's (you may have spotted her as the representative of the Black Lectroids in "Buckaroo Banzai") character dead after offering friendship and help to the albino mutants who populate the film. Overlong and kind of depressing, only Charlton Heston's strong screen presence can carry this film as far as it does. Anthony Zerbe isn't that good of a villain; it's hard to believe that old Chuck, with his chiseled in stone, 6-foot-3-inch comic book build, would have any problem beating him up, so it's kind of hard to believe that Zerbe killed Heston at the end (Zerbe only won because he had the script on his side). Still, this one might be good for a midnight gathering of people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's fess up....this is not such a great movie......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "The Omega Man" in 1971 when I was 9 and thought it was pretty cool; having just watched it again 40 years later, I realize (with a deep sigh) that it's actually pretty lame.It reminds me of some of those "classics" our high school English teachers had us read from time to time; you've been told for years by authority figures that you instinctively trust how terrific and epic and timeless the story is, and then, when you read it, well, it's a real struggle NOT to put it down and go on to something else more worthy of your time.1971's "The Omega Man" is a lot like that; it's a poorly written and directed and scored and produced picture that just happens to feature some pretty good actors, who struggle very hard to make the most of what they've been given to work with.Charlton Heston, of course, cut from the same mold of Sean Connery and Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro, always makes a sub-standard film worth watching, and his performance here is focused and sincere- you can tell that he took his assignment seriously. Supporting actors Anthony Zerba and Rosalind Cash also put forth sincere and well meaning efforts towards the project.The problem is, everything else about the film is pretty poorly done.The scriptwriting team of John and Joyce Corrington, who also wrote the epic screenplays for the spectacular "Battle for the Planet of the Apes" and the epic "Killer Bees", (need I say more??), work their magic here with yet another flimsy script featuring plot holes galore and plenty of cheesy dialog (Richard Matheson, who wrote the original "I am Legend" story on which this movie is based, said that the bad screenplay didn't bother him as it was so far removed from his original piece).Ron Grainer's funky 70's soundtrack, which is poorly suited for the action on the screen, sounds like a cross between the worst episode of "Starsky and Hutch" and the rejected music from 'Cleopatra Jones". It becomes downright annoying after a short time (thank goodness for modern technology and the "mute" button!)Numerous sloppy on-screen errors (people &amp; vehicles in the background of the "deserted" city, brightly lit interiors of buildings that have no electricity for lights!), choppy direction and rather poor, washed out cinematography add the "icing on the cake" (and insult to the audience) to a film that is more at home as the second movie at a drive-in double feature (when everybody is making out at that late hour and not watching the screen anyway).Worth a look for die hard Charlton Heston fans (which I am), but, if you're looking for much better renditions of Richard Matheson's source material, you're better off checking out Vincent Price in 1964's "The Last Man on Earth" or Will Smith in "I am Legend" (2007).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Read the novel - forget the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read the novel ("I am legend") by Richard Matheson many years ago which is gripping from the beginning to the end. In fact, it's one of my favorite science fiction / horror novels. I knew that "The Omega Man" is based on it but when I watched it for the first time, I was so much disappointed as the basic plotline (very basic) and a few names is all the movie has in common with the book.In the book, the mutants are vampires (result of ongoing biologiacal warfare), Robert Neville is a civialian and no military scientist who discovers by coincidence that he is immune due to an infection had inflicted during his army service, his archfiend isn't Matthias, the head of a freaky group of mutants, but his neighbor and friend Ben Cortman... and in the end, when the vampires are extinguished and a new society emerges which isn't immune but controls the virus, Neville comes to the point that he is obsolete and a threat to the new society due to his difference. Another movie version is "The last man on Earth", an Italian-American co-production starring Vincent Price which keeps a bit more to the novel but suffers from an incredibly poor budget. I strongly recommend reading the novel!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought The Omega Man could be a truly interesting movie, but I was painfully wrong. While the punch of Planet of the Apes or Soylent Green are reduced largely because everyone already knows the ending, this movie simply isn't very good. It's poorly assembled, where numerous times, the filmmakers substituted still photographs of Los Angeles to convey how empty the city is, but it fails, because they're obviously still photographs. The costumes for the family are silly, and they are so absurd that they hardly make for credible villains. The acting is wooden, from Heston, Anthony Zerbe, and Rosalind Cash, and the script is just stupid. After about 10 minutes of Heston making jokes about being alone, you'll want to turn it off. You really should.There's decent post-apocalyptic fare out there, but this isn't it. This is in retrospect, Charlton Heston's 98 minute advertisement for the importance of always carrying machine guns complete with a mixture of odd blaxploitation and lessons that aren't learned.</fullReview>

The so-bad-it's-inspired music? The total lack of tension? Yeah, I don't know where to begin, but I'll tell you this: if you want to waste your money and time watching a movie that defiles cinema, really insults the hell out of it, please, check out Omega Man. It's not the worst movie ever made, but it's no Ed Wood movie, either.And to think that this movie is "based" (yeah right) on I Am Legend, a novel that should've been brought straight over, vampires and all. I will never understand why in God's name Hollywood gets excited about a novel/story - theoretically, um, because the story is brilliant (a safe assumption, no?) - and decides the first thing that's gonna happen is a gutting of said story's magic, from the inside out. That's the relationship between I Am Legend and Omega Man, with the former a taut, smart, terrifying thrill-fest that's eminently cinematic and the latter...well, just another terrifyingly bad movie. Which the world needed, right? Even in 1971? Apparently.Like I say, I cannot understand why the novel's main feature - vampirism - wasn't carried over to the film. Were vampires dead (as it were) in 1971? Totally uncool or something? I wish I could figure that out. Because the Family is not scary, not even a little bit, but the things in I Am Legend? Oh yeah, they're scary, to the point of being very F'd up. Alas. I knew in my heart this movie was gonna suck, and it did suck. I hate when that happens. I crave being proved wrong. Didn't happen this time.Don't waste your time on this. Read I Am Legend instead, believe me. Or, if you've already read it, go on a hike or something.

		<fullReview>About me: I'm 44 old male, so I watched a lot of movies in my lifetime.Story-Line: In 1977, Charlton Heston is the last remaining human in Los Angeles after an apocalyptic war, except a group of deformed humans who call themselves the "Family". The plague has made them ultra sensitive to light so they only come out at night. It has also turned them into homicidal killers who have turned their hate into a religion against science and technology.About the Movie/Verdict: Although I loved this movie as a kid, "The Omega Man" in 2016. is hopelessly dated with its special effects, fight scenes and music. If the soundtrack does not make you laugh, the clothes will. The dialogue is also laugh out loud dated. Flick has some fairly interesting moments, the most memorable being the view of a devastated, empty downtown Los Angeles. Not really recommended for younger audience since they will probably just sit there confused at the dated stuff and the poor film making. It is, also, one of the first major Hollywood films to show an interracial kiss.Rating: 3Favorite quote: There's never a cop around when you need one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of the three movie adaptations of the novel, this is without doubt the worst. Let me just say that just because this is different from the book isn't my main gripe, even ignoring the differences the movie as a stand alone movie just doesn't cut it for me. In regard to the vampires, the phrase, "what were they thinking" comes to mind, I mean they are just so stupid and silly looking that they are almost comical rather than scary, and the fact that they join a cult when infected is just plain ridiculous. The romance part of the movie was just out of place and the movie could just as easily survived without it, and the soundtrack, oh my goodness the soundtrack, like I said before, "what the hell were they thinking?" the music sounds like it belongs in some soppy lovey dovey chick-flick rather than a horror/sci-fi movie, which is what the story is meant to be. Now getting on to Mr Neville, Charlton Heston plays the hero, that's all fine and well but its just too predictable and not very compelling, and even the position in which he dies is just too obvious as to who he's imitating,(think of a capital T and you get the idea). Overall this is a poor imitation/attempt of what is a compelling story, and even overlooking the differences from the book it just doesn't do it on its own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get my summary line twisted. I know this was way before the Will Smith vehicle (though based on the same story). And it does interpret the story a bit differently. Which starts off with the villains. But see for yourself. Charlton Heston is ... what you are used of him in this movie. And he could very well be saying the last line of Planet of the Apes as a first line in this movie.Some dialogue scenes feel weird and a few things really look and feel dated. But watching the Behind the scenes stuff gives you a different feeling of the (Omega) man Heston. If you know your Greek alphabet you will be able to understand why this particular letter was chosen (though you could argue after watching it, that another letter would have done too).Another thing that surprised me is the similarity to another movie. And no I'm not referencing the "I am Legend" movie again, but "Daywalkers". There is a distinctive theme here (and in the other movie), that has been carried over.Pretty good (influential) movie, that is worth your while ... especially if you are into Sci-Fi!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Close Call But It Doesn't Quite Work For Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following a biological war Robert Neville a Doctor and an Army officer who had been involved in the research of biological agents finds himself the only human survivor except for the dangerous mutants who come out only at night due to their sensitivity to light. Just as time was running out Neville was able to develop a vaccine but he would unfortunately be the only recipient. After years of isolation Neville discovers other survivors who are infected but not mutated and believes he might be able to treat them and prevent them from mutating.Some interesting ideas and good scenes and the film looks quite good for 1971 but at times it takes an approach that's to heavy handed including imagery and some rather forced plot developments. The performances are adequate, Heston is certainly a demonstrative actor but agreeable in the role, the mutants are over the top as scripted and Neville's fellow survivors are a bit clichéd. The film also suffers for its 70's esthetic's, and there are a few key concepts that don't work such as the mutants obvious intelligence and organization but continuing inability to overwhelm Neville. In the more recent version the reality of one man surviving against a vast horde of mutants is portrayed more realistically and perhaps this taints my appreciation of how this is handled here.The film is based (somewhat loosely) on the Richard Matheson novel "I Am Legend", the novel was previously adapted as "Last Man on Earth" with Vincent Price in 1964 and subsequently as "I am Legend" with Will Smith in 2007.Despite the films association with Zombie genre the creatures here are far more intelligent than your average zombie in that they have built a society and are still capable of speech. Also while the creatures are murderously intent on destroying Neville they are not seemingly the stereotypical driven killers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always thought Charlton Heston was a great actor and he does an admirable job in this movie despite its many flaws in logic. Anthony Zerbe as Matthias does a great job too. However, If I were being hunted down by a bunch of mutants I think I'd be heading for the hills ASAP instead of hanging around in the hopes of finding where the mutants hide at night with the intention of destroying them. It never fails to amaze me how the characters in some movies seem to always invite danger when they should be running the other way. It's called bad screen writing. And the downbeat ending, which has Heston dying in a pool of blood while the remaining humans--including children--look on rather unconcernedly, was a big turnoff for me.My biggest problem with this movie, other than its obvious lapses in logic, is the score. I think Granier is a great composer, but he falls far short of the mark with his cheesy, over-the-top style. At the end of the movie we are left with Heston lying dead in a pool of blood while a silly cha-cha underscores the pathetic scene. Another major turnoff.If you are a fan of Heston, you may want to see this movie. If not, I wouldn't bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Neville appears to be the sole survivor of a biologically waged war. That is except for the mutant night creatures that thirst for Neville's death. Known as the family, they represent the scientific downfall of mankind. Can Neville survive? Is it worth him surviving even after having found a vaccine to the plague?The Richard Matheison novel, I Am Legend, is proving a really hard book to adapt successfully, even now after a CGI laden modern take starring Will Smith, we are waiting for a film to do this incredible premise justice. The Omega man isn't a bad film at all, its first half is quite simply very intriguing stuff, Charlton Heston is Neville and he has to battle with mental solitude whilst worrying about the albino creatures of the dark that want his blood. But once the story kicks on, the plot wears thin and drifts off into horror conventions purely as a means to up the entertainment value of the piece. It's also not helped by a quite ludicrous score from Ron Grainer, even allowing for the 70s nature of production, it's jaunty when it should be menacing and detracts from the darker moments of the story. Heston does fine, and easily carries the picture well enough to keep it from mundane average hell, but once the final credits role and the ending sinks in, you kind of feel you have been cheated out of a good movie, which is sad because it promised so very much early on. 6/10 (mainly for the first half).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate White Supremacist Actioneer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Husband and wife scenarists John and Joyce Carrington of "Boxcar Bertha" fame alter Richard Matheson's novel "I Am Legend" in "Mosquito Squadron" director Boris Sagal's violent remake as "The Omega Man" with Charlton Heston taking over the character that Vincent Price created in the 1964 original film "The Last Man on Earth." Germ warfare has devastated the earth, and scientist John Neville is the only man alive who has acquired immunity from the plague that gradually turns humans into mutants. Unlike the brooding Italian-produced original, where the plague turned everybody into zombie-like vampires, "The Omega Man" turns everybody into a mob of pale-faced maniacs that can only come out after dark to do their dirty deeds. These fiends wear hooded robes and resemble albinos. They are a murderous bunch led by a former TV news announcer named Mathias (Anthony Zerbe of "License to Kill") and they refer to themselves as 'the Family.' This is one of the better aspect of this hit and miss melodrama. Mathias is Neville's sworn enemy, and Mathias' mutant mob never stop trying to kill our hero. When Mathias and company are not roaming the streets in search of Neville, they hole up in the courthouse and await the sun to go down. (This is another clever touch in a film that needs a lot of clever touches. Sunlight damages their eyes and weakens them. During the day, Neville scours Los Angeles for signs of intelligent life. The mutant capture him early on, and Mathias is about to have him killed when Dutch (Paul Koslo of "Joe Kidd") and Lisa (Rosalind Cash of "Klute") rescue him. They surprise the mutants by turning on the stadium lights so Neville can overpower his captors and flee. Briefly, Neville and his newly discovered friends join forces. Neville distills a serum from his own blood and saves Lisa's little brother Ritchie (Eric Laneuville of "Death Wish") but Lisa turns and allows Mathias and his vermin ambush Neville.Warner Brothers lensed the second version of "I Am Legend" entirely in Los Angeles on Sundays and holidays when the streets were empty and the filmmakers could simulate a city abandoned. Boris Sagal and his scribes change up the hero so that he is more military minded in his destruction of his enemies. Robert Morgan (Vincent Price) was merely a scientist, whereas Heston arms himself with an array of ultra-cool, exotic weaponry to battle the villains. Unlike Vincent Price and Will Smith's heroes, Heston doesn't have a dog. Heston's Neville resides in a fortified town-house and parks his car in an underground garage, a far cry from Price's modest digs. The other major change is that the villains are no longer vampires. They behave like a mob. They don't shamble like zombies; instead, they can run, jump, and throw spears. Despite their greater numbers, they prove easy prey when our hero packs a grease gun and can mow them down. Unquestionably, Sagal and company have opened up the Matheson novel and given it greater scope?aside from its widescreen Cinemascope?with an ending that bodes well for humanity. Basically, "The Omega Man" serves as a metaphor of the theme of the erosion of white male authority figures during the 1970s when fringe groups managed to acquire greater influence over society. Otherwise, most of what happens alternates between Neville shooting his way out of scrapes and pretentious dialogue about his messiah status. An inter-racial romance between Heston and Cash isn't allowed to go very far, even though they spend an on-screen night in the sack and we see Cash nude from the side the next morning as she opens the curtains to let the sun into the room. Charlton Heston spends at least half of the film running around bare-chested displaying his athletic prowess. Composer Ron Grainer of "Dr. Who" and "The Prisoner" contributes a lackluster score, especially during the opening credits.Undoubtedly, "The Omega Man" sits better for a mainstream audience but it lacks the atmosphere of the Price original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a BAD movie from such a GREAT novel..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I do like this film as a "bad" movie. It's a shame such a great novel (I am Legend, by Richard Matheson) had to be sacraficed in the process. The only aspects of the novel left in this film is Robert Nevele's name and the city it takes place in.Usually Heston is a good actor, or at least compentent. But in this fractrured flick, his acting is on par with William Shatner...HAMMY!Seems Nevele has a real problem driving, throughout this film, everytime he's in a car he crashes it. My Pal Ryan noted, "Well seems like he doesn't get where he's going until he crashes..." Good call Ryan.Another scene Heston's shooting some "zombies" that are using a catapult, we noticed he was really proficent at shooting up the catapult. But later in the film the leader of the "zombies" tells him that in that attack he had killed 3 of them. Must have been splinters from the wooden catapult....While watching we are told it has been about 2 and half years since the plague...but in one scene Heston is cooking hot dogs...even freezing hot dogs, meat doen't last more than about a year even frozen, so where did he get the meat?Heston seems to be in really good shape for an almost middle aged guy, he says in one scene that he had done a 3min50sec mile. Wow, he broke the land speed record!! But, as my pal Ryan pointed out, if he's going THAT fast, why is he only mildly jogging in the scene?Heston seems to have some very mixed up priorities...ok he wants to kill off the "zombies", ok, and they only come out at night. Why does he hunt them during the day when every night they hang out in front of his house calling his charater's name..as we noted..why doesn't he shoot them down then? Can he only shoot at inanimate objects at night?Ok, we belive Heston when he tells us that he injected himself with the "vaccine" to make himself immune to the plague. But in every injection scene in this film the fluid squirts into the air from the point of injection. While I profess not to be a medical expert, every injection I have ever had goes into the body and not into the air.Please don't let these comments prevent you from watching a great "B" film. The age(Early 70's) of the film only enhances it's fun! Defiantely worth a rental!</fullReview>

It's Camp Value (meaning Cheesy) is what makes it work for some Folks, but for the most part its Glaring Ineptitudes cannot be forgiven, even for a Cheap Thrill.There are many things that stand out as Pedestrian and are Workmanlike and carry very little imagination. The Musical Score is ill fitting, chinsy, and intrude on many Scenes rather than underly or enhance. The Lepers (yes, there is some Clunky Christ Analogies) are Dressed Up like Monks and speak in some sort of Post Apocalyptic Religioso Jargon. "He of the Wheel" and so forth.Of Heston's Sci-Fi Trilogy of the Era, this is the worst by far. Watching Chuck watch Woodstock (1969) alone in a Movie Theatre mouthing the Dialog and uttering "they don't make em' like that anymore" is not Eerie, just Irritating. Movie Audiences are to Lament the fact that they don't make any Movies anymore. Now that's something to feel sorry about after the World has Virtually been Wiped Out of People.But if they were only making Movies as Unremarkable and Flaccid as this one, that might not be a Bad Thing. That perfectly describes this one. A Bad Thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess this is a cult movie...and I'm not in the cult. I remember going to the theater to see this, and as I recall I wasn't thrilled with it then. Now, in my view, it's downright foolish...even though it had a lot of potential.Things go fairly well until Heston realizes there are other "normal" people (if you can call them normal). Then two things happen. First, there's a pretty big share of really dumb dialog. Second, the film begins to seem more dated than some films made back in the 1930s.If you can get beyond that...and your own laughter...there are things here to enjoy. I always liked Anthony Zerbe as a character actor, but this is just too bizarre to enjoy his talents. It was nice to see Eric Laneuville as a Black youth...he was quite good back in the day's of television's "Room 222", and this was his first film.Aside from that...I'm almost sorry I even watched this again. Charlton Heston -- once the colossus that was "Ben Hur" had fallen very far by 1971, and if you look at the list of films he was making in this period, it's clear he was struggling to stay relevant. That's not to say he didn't have a few good film performances left in him. I guess in 1971 we had to have a tie in with Black power...hence the casting of Rosalind Cash. Sorry, I just don't buy into it.Perhaps if you like this level of science fiction, okay, but other than for a laugh, I'd leave this in the dustbin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlton Heston is well cast as Dr. Richard Neville, sole survivor after biological warfare from World War III has decimated the world, resulting in those unlucky enough to survive becoming crazed mutants called "The Family", who have rebelled against all science and technology, and relentlessly persecute Richard, trying to kill him as retribution for the war. Neville tries to kill as many of them as he can, since they are sensitive to daylight, and only threaten at night, while at the same time try to develop a cure while barricaded in his high-rise apartment.Based on Richard Matheson's novel, film is surprisingly poor; both visually tacky and horrendously dated and bizarre, generating more laughter than scares, and not at all convincing. A real farrago, though has become a cult-film nonetheless!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is hard to discuss the merits of "The Omega Man," the 1971 filmization of Richard Matheson's source novel "I Am Legend" (1954), without comparing them to the original 1964 version, "The Last Man on Earth." Though that earlier film is usually belittled in comparison to the latter version starring Charlton Heston, to my surprise, I find it preferable. For one thing, the original movie, although it changes the main character's name, adheres more closely to Matheson's book, telling the story of Earth's last man standing (Vincent Price) after a biological plague has transformed everyone else into vampiric zombies. The latter film substitutes a clan of albino mutants--led by one of my favorite character actors, Anthony Zerbe--that is out to destroy Chuck and all remnants of mechanized civilization; call them pasty-faced uber-Luddites. Personally, I find bloodsucking, lurching zombies a LOT scarier than murderous albinos! "The Omega Man," to its credit, does feature some good action sequences and amusing one-liners from Heston, particularly before he finds some actual people to talk to. On the downside, it also features a score that I think is absolutely dreadful. Funkified and inappropriate, it almost succeeds in making the film seem like some kind of cheesy blaxploitation effort. What makes this all the more dismaying is that the film's composer, Ron Grainer, was previously responsible for one of TV's all-time great themes, for "The Prisoner." It's not often that the background music in a film has bothered me as much. All in all, while "The Omega Man" is an entertaining time passer, it can't compare to the sometimes-surreal freakiness of the Price version, or the concise scientific rationalism of Matheson's novel. There is not a single scene in the '71 film, for example, that is half as creepy as the one in which Vincent's dead wife, Virge, comes back to the house. Gives me the chills just thinking about it...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheesy and dated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* 1/2 out of ****Charlton Heston stars as Robert Neville, presumably the only survivor of a plague that either kills its victims or turns them into albino, nocturnal people who now call themselves "The Family." These beings are sensitive to light, so Neville remains safe during the day and with the lights on in and around his "fortress" at night. He sort of just runs a daily routine of exploring during the day, until he discovers another possible survivor.The Omega Man has a wonderful premise, one that could work on so many levels; as sci-fi, horror, drama, and/or action, but it fails on all counts, thanks to the horribly wrong decisions director Boris Sagal makes and quite a bit of unbearable cheese noticeable throughout the production. Mistake number one is the score. The premise is about a man who believes he is the last of his kind on Earth. To accentuate quiet creeepiness, it would have been preferable not to implement any music whatsoever (or at least use it sparingly). But unfortunately, we have a score, and a terrible and terribly loud one at that. It's a constant distraction that's among the film's biggest mistakes.Sagal attempts to deliver a few thrills here and there, but the action sequences are poorly staged and shot. A motorcycle ride that should have been exciting is instead made silly with choppy slow motion. And you have to ask yourself, if you had an entire arsenal, would you really only take one gun with you when you wander into dangerous territory at night?The movie stars Charlton Heston, so acting is not exactly going to be one of its strong points. Heston himself isn't bad here, but he does little that makes him easy to sympathize with, and virtually every other actor here with the exception of Anthony Zerbe is terrible. Most laughable is a scene where Rosalind Cash actually pretends to be a mannequin. The climax is actually not bad, one of the film's few laudable points. The last fifteen minutes are actually fairly suspenseful, and caps off with a pretty good ending. But then comes the final scene, with its blatant Christ imagery, which ends the film on the same sour note that's present for most of the picture.Since The Omega Man, a lot of films have taken on a similar premise with arguably more engrossing results. There's George Romero's terrific Living Dead series and most recently, Danny Boyle's excellent 28 Days Later, which succeeds on the levels The Omega Man failed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We Are The Family... I got all my Albino-Brothers with me!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now that I've finally seen all three major film versions of Richard Matheson's famous novel "I Am Legend" (I have no idea why it took me until now to check out this version), I have to say the most splendid adaptation is NOT the big-budgeted new blockbuster starring Will Smith and it is NOT this early 70's cult classic starring the almighty Charlton Heston, either. The best and definitely most faithful interpretation of Matheson's spine-chilling story is the modest and mainly Italian-produced gem "Last Man on Earth" starring Vincent Price. That movie truly captures the apocalyptic atmosphere like Matheson intended it and also the 'creatures of the night' are the most menacing and creepy in this oldest black-and-white version. Vincent Price battled for survival against bleak and slow-moving vampire-like creatures, like it was meant to be. The 2007 film replaced these with hyperactive computer-engineered monsters that aren't the least bit scary and this particular version even altered the nature of the creatures completely. In "The Omega Man", last man on earth Robert Neville is up against a kind of organized sect of albino mutants. They still can't walk around in the daylight and dress up in monk outfits, but they have a leader ? named Matthias ? and refer to their well organized club as "The Family". Matthias and his disciples believe that the extermination of the human race through chemical warfare was a punishment from God and it is their mission to destroy all remaining symbols of science and technology. Neville, the last human and immune to the plague, is the ultimate remnant of modern times and thus they organize a witch-hunt against him each night. Neville himself finds new courage to continue his search for a vaccine when he discovers a group of fellow survivors living in the countryside.I'm not quite sure what to think of "The Omega Man", to be entirely honest. Like many people, I just love those grotesque and flamboyant Sci-Fi movies from the early 70's ? especially when they starred gun freak Heston - and the movie does offer a lot of explicit violence considering its year of release, but the whole production is just too damn silly and the movie simply doesn't convey the atmosphere of despair and solitude like it should do. Despite some extended images of Heston cruising around forsaken LA streets during the opening sequences, you never feel truly convinced that he is, in fact, the last remaining human being on the planet. Vincent Price depicted a tormented and genuinely hopeless scientist, whereas Heston merely acts like a kid in an empty toy store. The mutants, despite their reasonably eerie Albino appearance, don't succeed in making you feel uncomfortable. They're hammy monsters that talk too much and too fluent in order to be scary and their ideals of "cleansing" the planet are a bit ludicrous. Still, "The Omega Man" is fast-paced and never contains any dull moments. Heston gives away his typical macho performance, even though his emotional reactions whilst watching "Woodstock" are a bit hard to digest considering the man's well-known political ideas.</fullReview>

Most of the other complaints have been listed, but a couple more that bugged me included the way the stunt driver of the motorcycle clearly had different hair--color and style--than Heston, and the rather pathetic "persecution" of the protagonist when the mutants have him in the cart and are hauling him away. I think they threw a few pieces of paper at him and even (gasp) touched his shirt--though not enough to mess it up or even "untuck" it. (Quotation marks have been added so that the spell checker of IMDb won't try to get me to replace it with "unstuck")Overall, it's fun to see this and compare it to I am Legend, but really, there's not much comparison. Also--I don't remember anywhere in the movie addressing the issue of all the animals. In I am Legend Will Smith's character has a dog, but aside from thinking I heard a bird or two, were they all dead?</fullReview>

The problem is once all this is set up and done, episodic scenes pile up, action ushers in, and all without any real sense for urgency and doom, or even sheer insanity.Eventually it looks cheap, boring, without the attenuating circumstance of creating a extremely efficient gritty look 'n feel.

		<fullReview>I saw the movie when it was theatrically released and I enjoyed it very much.Since,I read Matheson's novel,I saw the first version "last man on earth" and ,when I saw it again recently, I was not as much thrilled as I had been then.On the plus side,Heston is a solid actor whose talent is obvious ,the desert landscapes are impressive,and the scene when Rosalind Cash becomes a mutant gives the jitters even today.But the script writers have given a totally false rendering of Matheson's sensational conclusion:man has become THE enemy,now the new society is the vampires' one (it deals with vampires,not mutants in the book)and man will become a legend (hence the title of Matheson's novel),a superstition,a tale the parents will tell their naughty children when the lights are on (or I hope so).Here Neville is not only the omega man,he's also the alpha man.And the final shots show him in the Christ position,a Christ without whom the others could not have survived.But these others are the human race carrying on and en route to the brand new world it's never too late to build.Plus ça change..Also handicapped by frequent use of the hippie ideology.Heston watching "Woodstock" in a desert theater (Coming into Los Angeles,sings Arlo ),because he needs company -and "Woodstock" is par excellence the "crowd" movie-cannot match the intimate pictures which the hero of "last man on earth" enjoys .Both "Woodstock" and the "normal" human neo hippy community date the movie,whereas the black and white version is timeless.It's very interesting,provided you've read the novel,to see the Vincent Price version and the Charlton Heston one in a row.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is set in the near future and Charlton Heston seems to be the only person left on the planet. Everyone else is either dead or a psychotic zombie that cannot come out during the daytime. So during much of the film, cool Heston drives about town in his cool car--rooting for food or blowing apart the occasional zombie. And after a long day of this, it's home--not for a Miller beer, but to hide out in his amazing fortress home. At night, the crazed zombies attack his home again and again, but since Heston would later become the president of the NRA, it wasn't surprising that he proceeded to blow the crap out of the intruders--and do it with great gusto and style. Seeing Heston with a machine gun mowing them down was indeed a guilty pleasure.There's a lot more to the movie than this--including a REASON for the plague that did this to the people and explained why he was immune (something forgotten in the earlier version of this film that starred Vincent Price). In addition, later in the film some hope for the redemption of mankind appears--thought you'll have to see the film for yourself to find out exactly what occurred.This film is rare in that it's a remake of an earlier film AND it's actually better than the original! While not as good as Heston's greatest sci-fi films, PLANET OF THE APES and SOYLENT GREEN, it is wonderful fun. Sure, it isn't Shakespeare or amazingly artistic--just good old fun that is very re-watchable. An excellent and cool film that will please most viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps 1971 is just one of those years where everything viewed today looks dated, but this movie seems to have every base covered, language, fashion, social outlook, you name it. And so we find Charlton Heston in another post apocalyptic drama, although this time he's fodder for a white-skinned, darkness-loving bunch of albino mutants rather than a shrewdness of apes, as before.It's actually pretty bad from start to finish, with Heston resplendent in safari jacket and slacks (alternating, if you will, with a neat zip-up head-to-toe track-suit) marauding through a deserted Washington, keeping Anthony Zerbe's "Family" of murderous renegades. Naturally Zerbe's presence takes us immediately into "TV-movie" territory and things get worse when Heston encounters a jive-talking black "chick" who seems to be rehearsing for every Blaxploitation film yet to be made. Their first encounter is hilarious, her pretending to be a showroom dummy in an abandoned fashion-shop and while they get off to a feisty start, it's not long before they, somewhat daringly for the time, are canoodling in each other's arms. Some of their dialogue is accidentally awful, none worse than when old Chuck puts her on the back of his motorbike and tells her to "hitch up your drawers". Unfortunately she also has a kid son who gets infected with the virus for which Heston has the only vaccine, and who, once cured, takes it on himself to attempt to broker a peace with Zerbe's mob. It all resolves itself in a bloodless shoot-out (or where Heston is concerned, spear-out) with our man framed in a Christ-like sacrificial pose as the end credits roll. Worse yet, there isn't even a Curtis Mayfield, Marvin Gaye or Isaac Hayes soundtrack to take your mind off what you're watching, what is, in summary, an unintentionally funny museum- piece of a movie.</fullReview>

This time he's apparently the last (normal) human alive in a big city (New York?) that's been devastated by a plague created by the man. Heston's character will have to face a new breed of men that despise everything that comes from the modern civilization, the advances and the technology of the modern world and which want to destroy him.This movie has become a little bit out of date as time has gone by: those afro hairdos, that soundtrack that make the movie sound like it was a 70's porno film (one of the most unfortunate soundtracks I can remember). There's not much to stand out about "The Omega Man". Maybe those shocking shots of the lonely-lifeless city... Nowadays, The Omega Man can only make you laugh and feel a little embarrassed for it. OK, in some moments it is entertaining, but nothing else. If I have to watch Heston on a future-destroyed world I'd rather watch him in "The planet of the apes" or in "Soylent Green".*My rate: 5.5/10</fullReview>

Probably because it was too good of an idea and would be something people would definitely want to see. I guess somebody decided to make "Wild Wild West" or "My Favorite Martian" instead.For years this has been the "modern" version of "The Last Man On Earth."

		<shortDescription>Disappointment....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amazing how a person's memory of a film can be severely jarred by watching it again 20 years later. Growing up in the late 60's and early 70's, I used to watch this film every year when it re-ran on TV. I loved it then and lamented for years the fact that it was no longer shown. As many know, this changed last year and now I see it showing up in the guide every few months on AMC(!) It still had the elements I found so unsettling as a teen but it was so dated in almost every respect that I ended up laughing at it more than anything else. Which begs the question, how do you know a movie is, if not a classic, at least worth preserving and keeping "in touch with" over the years? My own feeling on this is simple- a truly good movie, a classic, may have elements that "date" it, but that never interferes with your enjoyment of it. An example of an 80's flick I can see over and over again and still enjoy is "The Four Seasons" with Alan Alda. Another 80's film that does not hold up nearly as well is "The Big Chill."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining But Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE OMEGA MAN is one of the worst pictures I have ever seen. It is a failed attempt to recreate the same flavor as PLANET OF THE APES. Unfortunately, the filmmaker makes no attempts at making the story engaging, realistic, or watchable. In fact, the picture emanates B-grade black explotation. Not to mention the actors are forced to say some of the most horrid lines in the face of modern cinema.Chucky Heston, however, is at his best. He shoots guns and talks down to every other character in the movie. His words and expression are priceless; his monologues even better.As a result, I recommend THE OMEGA MAN. I guarantee you will laugh and enjoy every moment of it. I also guarantee you'll say those magical words, "I LOVE THE NRA!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Oh ... my ... god ..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this again today. What a terrible mistake. I recorded it from TV because I vaguely recalled seeing it back in the '70s, maybe at a drive-in, or perhaps on late-night TV. I also had a vague recollection of it being OK.In hindsight, I think I must have been absolutely off my face at the time, because, oh, how my memory had deceived me ... I could not have been more wrong. It is not OK. It is mind-bogglingly terrible - without doubt, one of the cheapest, shoddiest pieces of pseudo-hip, plastic, cliché-ridden, overacted rip-off Seventies Z-grade Hollywood garbage ever foisted on an unsuspecting public. The only amusing aspect was that I had watched the superb "Shaun of the Dead" the night before, and this provided me with a gold-plated example of that old adage about 'chalk and cheese'.And what a horrible, rancid, stinky, mouldy old piece of cheese it is. This frightening mutation of a movie has just everything wrong with it. You'd think you couldn't go far wrong with Matheson's fine original story, but oh no, they had to make it "hip" in that dreadful, stodgy, cringe-inducing Mod Squad way that only Hollywood in that era could. Everything about it screams 'cheap Seventies 'telemovie', from the script to the sets to the horrible, stagey performances. It looks like it was shot in three days, the 'sets' are SO obviously the Warner backlot, the script is appalling, and it features some of the most spectacularly bad acting in movie history. Chuck's trademark "Oh ... my ... god" line - uttered when he finds he body of the black kid he'd saved from the plague - is the absolute nadir in a zombie-like performance that rates as one of the very worst in an otherwise fairly distinguished career. The Big Cornpone never had a great range, but to call this a one-note performance is to insult notes. The person I actually feel most sorry for is Rosalind Cash, who was obliged to strip off for no good reason, kiss Charlton Heston (erk!) and utter some of the most tooth-grindingly self-conscious blaxploitation lines ever committed to paper. But hey - no surprises there: a quick Google search for writers John and Joyce Corrington reveals a couple so blindingly white- bread that they make Anna Gasteyer and Will Ferrell's SNL school music teacher characters (Bobbi and Marty Culp) look like prime candidates for a Sly &amp; the Family Stone reunion. Even less surprising is the fact that the Corrington's mostly earned their living penning daytime soaps and Z-grade movie schlock-fests like "Killer Bees". I should have guessed.A special brickbat goes to TV veteran Anthony Zerbe, an actor every bit as corny as Chuck, and likewise one never known for avoiding a chance to chew the scenery, no matter how flimsy. Granted, he doesn't have much to work with but is just AWFUL - his wig is ridiculous and his acting is worse ... although I have to admit that, in a sterling display of racial equality, Lincoln Kilpatrick's portrayal of his sidekick Zachary is every bit as bad.Also - if the mutants are so anti-technology, where did they get those neatly-tailored lurex cloaks and designer shades? (I know, I know ...)But wait - there's one more dump I have to take on this film ... it's hard to single out the worst thing in a movie so spectacularly rich in bad points, but it leaps out at you from the opening shots - it is the awful, braying, corny score by Ron Grainer. Just ... TERRIBLE. This movie ought to be required viewing in every media course as a textbook example of how NOT to write music for films. It is loud, stupid, intrusive, almost entirely inappropriate/irrelevant to the action, and just plain BAD music in its own right. It beggars belief that such an experienced and otherwise accomplished screen composer could have turned in such a load of old crap ... but, on the other hand, it suits the movie perfectly, so maybe he got it right after all?In my mind the ONLY reason to watch this film - other than to get wrecked and have a good laugh at its expense - is for the views of downtown Los Angeles ca. 1970, before they totally ruined the place. Apart from that, I can only quote Men on Film:"HATED IT!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Taylor' in a bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was something about Charlton Heston that made him perfect for the role of Taylor in "Planet of the Apes" (1968) and "Beneath the Planet of the Apes" (1970), two of the greatest sci-fi/adventure flicks of all time. So it's no wonder that the producers of 1971's "Omega Man" chose Heston for what is essentially the same role in this film about the supposedly last man on earth living in L.A. after a war waged with biological weapons, loosely based on a book by Richard Matheson. Unfortunately the third time's definitely not the charm and the film holds little interest beyond an early 70s period piece or nostalgia.I remember catching "Omega Man" sometime in the 90s and expecting a great early 70s sci-fi flick with a great protagonist and all I remember was being extremely disappointed and (I think) not even finishing the flick. Well, I decided to give it another chance last night, fully braced for an underwhelming experience, and my original impressions were pretty accurate.The film starts off well with Taylor, I mean Neville (Heston,) wandering around a deserted Los Angeles, muttering to himself, watching "Woodstock" for the 100th time, etc. but the horribly dated 'hip' score is the first bad sign and then night comes down and these cloaked albino vampire-zombies appear, which is what turned me off the first time I caught the film. Just listen to their dialogue. I wanted to run away in horror, and not in the good way.But, from there, I hoped, that the film would settle into its own groove, as long as I overlooked the bad music and corny villains or just accepted them as a part of this period oddity. "Omega Man" does settle into a groove, it's just that it's not all that engrossing. And what's up with Heston taking off his shirt every 8 minutes? The flashbacks to how this apocalyptic scenario originated were interesting, as well as Neville's run-ins with others, but the film never rises above the mediocre and heavily dated.One might argue that "dated" is an unjust criticism given the film's age, but all good or great films are able to transcend their eras even while clearly being from their eras, like "Lawrence of Arabia," "Ben-Hur," "King Kong," "Jaws," "Apocalypse Now," "Night of the Living Dead," "One-Eyed Jacks," "Runaway Train" and "The Blue Max." "The Omega Man" miserably fails to accomplish this.Overall the film feels more like a mediocre made-for-TV flick than a theatrical release of its time. It almost has the look and feel of the original "Star Trek" series, but without the great writing and characters. The albino villains with their dark hoods and cloaks are reminiscent of the 'villains' in the episode "The Return of the Archons." In fact, believe it or not, the average Syfy flick is more interesting than "Omega Man." But it has its points of interest: a black female protagonist (Rosalind Cash), a worthy sidekick of sorts (Paul Koslo) and the desolate scenes of L.A., but its main appeal is as a period piece.The DVD I have (dark blue cover with orange lettering) features a 20-minute 'making of' piece, a trailer and a couple other insignificant features.The film runs 98 minutes.GRADE: D+ or C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The second adaptation of the book "I am Legend".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My pick for the weakest adaptation of the book, this one is still rather okay to watch thanks mainly to a very good performance from Charlton Heston. Of the three adaptations though it is a bit weak as it kind of strays from the original's intent without adding quite as much flare as the most recent incarnation of the book. Vincent Price's version "Last Man On Earth" has to be considered the one that follows the book the closest as the creatures in that one are portrayed as they were described in the book. Kind of a lumbering person, with very little strength or purpose for that matter. One easily held at bay by a few boards and such over the doors and windows. The ones in Will Smith's version are more animal like and super strong and not very easily held a bay. The one's here are totally different as well, not really the vampire like creature described in the book, but intelligent. The only thing wrong with them seeming to be an aversion to light which all three movies have them sharing in common. They also appear to be albino in this one. They have a leader and they form some sort of religious like cult. Heston drives through the city and such and shoots at anything that could possible be one of these creatures that are not really creatures here. He runs into some people who are more normal and he begins to try and cure them. Has its moments and it has its boring parts too. I have to say though that one other thing all three movies have in common is the crappy endings for the men named Neville.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlton Heston is one of the last people left on earth, which is a horrible enough thought in itself. The rest of the population is dead or has turned into zombies wearing monk's robes and controlled by Anthony Zerbe. Heston holds up in his apartment, drinks scotch, and takes pot shots at the zombies from the window at night. Lucky for Heston he has access to all those guns thanks to the NRA. Being all alone he goes a little funny in the head, as you would expect. But he meets another human, a woman and things are looking up.Previously made with Vincent Price as The Last Man on Earth. The movie would have been better with another lead. Heston is really a wooden actor. The premise is provocative but the movie isn't very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people most notably original author Richard Matheson have complained about the changes of this film adaption of I AM LEGEND , but I feel the changes are justified . The novel has few characters and little dialogue which doesn`t make it an ideal candidate for film adaption , likewise the book`s subtle subtext on deviancy which would ask us to empathise with the vampires would be too much for a cinema audience so I feel the changes to the novel are justified .THE OMEGA MAN is a fair film . The mutant villains are nasty enough though their calling each other " Brother " does grate after a while . There`s plenty of action and Charlton Heston does make a good hero .

		<shortDescription>The Original And Still The Best: Acting Over Effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:It is not even close, the acting here with Heston and Zerbe is what makes this the best rendition of the book. It is flawed, certainly, it has lots of 70's argot and culture in it that have not aged well. You know, the psychedelic clothes, Woodstock movie, the giant Afros and hideous decor but hey, at least you didn't have to grow up in it, like me, be grateful for that much. Zerbe steals the movie as Matthias who adds credibility to the story by refusing all the other members of The Family's repeated demands to use technology to destroy Neville. The makeup is excellent, who will forget when they show him what the virus did to them? My favorite scene has always been when he forgets what time it is, the sun is on the horizon, and he has to get home. The director shoots this so well, the way they pop out on him is one creepy scene. Also, the deserted city is done very well. Like Night Of The Comet, the camera is centered so you only see a few blocks. When he is searching the city, watch the upper right corner of an apartment building for the person they missed in a distant window. The 70's dialog, Dutch's dreadful acting and the fashions will get on your nerves a bit try, not to notice.The movie is plenty scary with Neville insisting on going into dark areas where my audience yelled at him. They pop out on him all over the movie. Who will forget when they kill the lights and start crawling up the sides of the building; one guy makes it in before the lights come back on. This is why it is the best: acting, writing, directing and photography. The back cast is weak mainly Dutch who is just awful: TV quality. His girlfriend and the tragic boy who thinks he can reason with Matthias, good luck, are fine. There is some black humor like: "Didn't anybody tell you guys that Halloween is over?" But, on the whole, it is a very dark and scary movie. Yes, Heston haters, it has the requisite I Am Moses scene where he dies for the human race and his blood will save everyone. I know, Heston always does this, even in Earthquake, Soylent Green is the only one he appears living at the end. He even gets speared in Khartoum. Just ignore it, the man was a great actor with wide range. The movie starts with him in the deserted city. The pacing is excellent but it is flawed. I still own it for the positives far outweigh the negatives. The two anchors, Heston and Zerbe, keep the movie intense. Another example of acting, writing and directing dwarfing special effects. Do not let me chase you away, the effects are good for this time. They cannot compete with I Am Legend's CGI but neither can that movie compete with this movie's acting, writing and directing. If effects are what you love, watch I Am Legend; for myself, the performances made me care about the characters and Zerbe is a great, malevolent villain. It is noteworthy to point out that Matthias defeats Neville here; his blood may save the human race but Heston loses and dies here. It is not the omnipotent Charlton Heston that irritates lots of young people. A Flawed But Still Good Movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Matthias is an albino, mutant douchebag.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the heels of the soon-to-be Will Smith blockbuster smash hit I Am Legend I decided to hit up history and check out the original take on Richard Matheson's I Am Legend. What I got was a great idea that never really came to fruition. Mostly because it was plagued by hammy acting and a poorly done ending.As you already know The Omega Man is about Robert Neville and his co-existence with a group of people known as The Family. The Family are humans who survived the germ warfare epidemic, but were mutated in a way where they're very sensitive to light, have lesions, and enjoy wearing hooded cloaks with police officer sun-glasses. Besides that, Robert Neville believes to be the last person on Earth, and his sole goal is to eradicate these Family Members by hitting up their Nest or base of sorts. Will Omega Man stop these radical fools or will the Family seize the day? Okay, first off, this is a great story. Everyone and their mother's have thought about being the last survivor on Earth. How cool would it be to race around in sports car, watch free movies, drink free booze, go to the bathroom where ever you want....it'd be heaven. And The Omega Man does give you the sense that Neville (played by Charlton Heston) is experiencing this sense of freedom, though with the Family lurking in the shadows he needs to carry a semi-automatic with him at all times. Hey, I could deal with that, that sounds like a fair trade. Besides the cool story, the movie was pretty much an average affair in almost all other areas. The characters were hit or miss, the acting was hammy at times and the screenplay was pretty weak. And the ending, which could have been pretty emotional was ruined by the completely wrong choice of music. Even though, the movie is only 90 or so minutes, it actually feels longer. To me it was most likely due to drawn out scenes that left no impact on the viewer.Overall the story is the main reason you should see this movie. There are no stand-out performances, the Family look cheesy most of the time, you've got some hammy acting. But when you add all these together, it's got the making of a classic sci-fi movie. I was just expecting something a little better and more worthy of the term "classic". A generous 7 outta 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Omega Man" is really a bad movie. I saw it when it originally came out and I don't think I've ever really liked it. Done on a low budget, it has the feel of a made-for-TV movie, with direction that seems phoned in and a script that should have been thrown out! Charlton Heston pretty much just plays...well...Charlton Heston, only he's often not very good at it. This must have only been an easy pay check for him. The one redeeming factor about this movie is the Ron Grainer score. It at least has energy, everything else seems tired and cliched. The movie tries to present a nightmare world where only a handful of "normal" human beings battle scarred, photophobic and insane survivors of a biochemical world war. But looking back at it over thirty years later the only thing that's frightening about it is the vision it gives of having to spend the rest of your life listening to 8-track tapes and jive-talking angry black people call you honkey! At least Heston gets to mercifully die at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting but not well executed sci-fi movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 10/4/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Boris Sagal): Interesting but not well executed sci-fi movie with Charleton Heston yet again infiltrating the genre. This movie based on a book tells the story of a world with one un-infected man left from a plague-victimized world. Heston's character is that man and he used a vaccine developed by himself to stay free of the disease. Now he shoots members of the Family(a white-skinned cultic group who can't handle the sunlight and poo-poo on the old mechanized world) and tries to stay alive until he eventually finds others. This version of the novel is a little clearer than the newer "I Am Legend" but the acting and direction aren't the greatest. In this version, Heston's character runs into a few others who haven't totally been infected yet and then tries to use his blood to make them immune as well. This movie has a real trippy 70's feel to it, but the main problem is that the acting isn't good enough to make you care about the characters. It really is barely above a "B" grade movie and it's too bad because the material has potential. I'll have to check out the original Vincent Price version to see if it made out any better later on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>frankly, it didn't matter to me at any point who emerged the victor: Charlton Heston or the ghouls led by Anthony Zerbe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Omega Man" is the second of three screen adaptations of the classic horror novel "I Am Legend" by famed author Richard Matheson and while I was not happy with two of those three, this one is by far, the most flexibly adapted, the most preposterous, the most random, the most juvenile, and the most tedious. Like the later film adaptation, which became the first to reuse Matheson's original title, "The Omega Man" uses the basic plot of the book, but not much else, to tell the story of a scientist thriving in New York shortly after a biological war has destroyed most of mankind and turned the others into zombie-like monsters. Charlton Heston plays the sole survivor, who has the city all to himself from sunrise to sunset, and must remain behind locked doors at night, for that is when the rabid others take over.Let me begin to give you a clue as to just how idiotic this loose adaptation is by describing the former-human monsters that roam the cities at night. In Matheson's original novel, they were people who had died and then turned into vampire-like zombies low on intellect but enormous in strength and durability. That was generally maintained in the first screen adaptation "The Last Man on Earth" (1964) starring Vincent Price. In the 2007 version, "I Am Legend" with Will Smith, they are near-superhuman creatures who have no connections to their former selves save a vague physical similarity.Now, what about in "The Omega Man." Well, they're still pretty much human. The only difference is, they've all turned albino and they all have a sudden taste for wearing dark cloaks like ghouls or goblins and sport sunglasses even in darkness and indoors. With that being said, you can guess that they're still very much human. They form posses as they hunt Charlton Heston, they use technology just as well as before, and they are still quite capable of speech. More than capable actually, for after a while I was becoming very tired of their ancient European church accents, in which they always address each other as "brother", given themselves silly names, and it's all nonsensical and harebrained. Seriously, there are moments where a conversation between two ghouls is like this:-"We must stop him, brother." -"Yes, but be patient, brother." -"But he's killed two more of us, brother." -"I know, brother."So, yeah, they aren't vampires or zombies or anything of the sort. They're just albino hippies in Halloween costumes who think they're living in the sixth century.Charlton Heston was one of the finest actors who ever lived and one of my personal favorites, however, "The Omega Man" was not one of his better endeavors. Heston puts a lot of enthusiasm into his role and his performance is acceptable, but nothing compared to his epic portrayal of Moses in "The Ten Commandments" (1956). And this is because, like the ghouls, Heston has the most outlandishly bad sci-fi language imaginable to utter and monologue.And even as an action movie, "The Omega Man" fails with an utterly preposterous jazz-like music score in the background and outlandishly bright cinematography and high-contrast red blood that spurts like crazy from bodies as Heston blazes away with a submachine gun at the ghouls. Maybe being turned into hippie-ghouls does that to your blood? I don't know and I don't care. And that was basically my whole reaction throughout "The Omega Man" and unfortunately, when more normal human beings turn up about halfway through, it just gets worse and worse until finally at the end, you really don't care who emerges victorious: Charlton Heston or the hippie-ghouls led by Anthony Zerbe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So bad it's Offensive.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I saw "I am legend" twice, then I read the Richard Matheson book and yesterday sat down to watch "The Omega Man", hoping that this would be a nice way to finish off. The disappointment was enormous. The only positive thing to say about it is, that the story in itself, that is to be the last man on earth, is so disturbing that this helps the movie not becoming entirely pathetic.Having said that there isn't anything, and I mean anything, that can be pointed out as positive. Acting, directing, special effects, costumes, the sound-effects and make-up are horrible to watch and listen to. What were they thinking? And I don't think that you can just explain these gigantic flaws with the fact that the movie is 37 years old.If they didn't have resources to make believable Dark Seekers (or members from "the family") then I don't understand why they didn't chose to focus on Neville's days instead of his nights. The daytime is just as creepy and eerie as the night-time. Then again I don't think that Heston is the type that can show us, in a convincing way, how sad and lonely he feels. He is probably better with a machine-gun in his hands.I am not going to write in detail about how this movie fails to meet any given minimum standards as this would probably give me an intense feeling of despair and depression. Please read the book or watch "I am legend" instead but don't finish off by watching this one as I did unless you love to watch a total disaster of a movie as I can see others apparently do.To those of you who have given this movie a high rating because you are entertained by it's bad quality I would just like to point out that people sometimes use the "average rating" from IMDb when they decide whether they should see a movie or not and therefore one could argue that they have been misguided when a movie is given high rating because of the involuntary entertainment value that sometimes follows bad quality.

		<shortDescription>The Omega Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Am Legend was an alright apocalyptic film nearly like a zombie movie, and I didn't realise it was based on this original version which I had heard of, from director Boris Sagal (Sherlock Holmes in New York). Basically in deserted Los Angeles, it has been two years since biological weapons between Russia and China destroyed civilisation, germ warfare has killed off mankind. The only remaining survivor seems to be lone and immune US Army scientist Robert Neville (Charlton Heston), who is living a solitary existence in the city that is empty during the day, but populated during the night. In the night a race of infected deformed formerly human creatures, i.e. mutants, calling themselves The Family plague the city, led by former newscaster now mutated Jonathan Matthias (Anthony Zerbe). While living whatever normal life he can, talking to himself and the streets completely deserted, Robert is looking both for any other living people and of course with his blood a cure for the epidemic. He does eventually Lisa (Rosalind Cash) who not only helps him get through the city at night without getting caught by the homicidally psychotic creatures who believe technology and science have made them the way they are, but she takes him to other survivors. Eventually after a lot of chases and near-misses, including a capture by The Family, a supposed cure is created by Robert from his blood samples, and they test it on a newly infected person. In the end Robert is seen near dying, and he hands new leader Dutch (Paul Koslo) the blood serum he created that could seemingly cure the mutant disease, and with Lisa the remaining survivors get away, and The Family die too. Also starring Lincoln Kilpatrick as Zachary, Eric Laneuville as Richie, Jill Giraldi as Little Girl, Anna Aries as Woman in Cemetery Crypt and Brian Tochi as Tommy. Heston, playing the same character Will Smith did, is cool and collected most of the time, talking to himself and spending leisure time in parts of the city, and when necessary he gets the weapons out. Obviously the remake version is a little more freaky with the mutants that don't talk and eat people, these ones however talk, where hoods and sunglasses, and just act like terrorists wrecking stuff and wanting to possibly kill you, possibly not as scary, but this is still a worthwhile science-fiction thriller. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tacky 1970s version of the I AM LEGEND story and having the clichés of the period: angry black biker chick, a groovy group living an alternative lifestyle etc. It also sports an albino zombie gang clad in cowls and sunglasses called the family (something of a nod to Charles Manson's gang of the time). One black member(who with his whited-up appearance looks disconcertingly like Harpo Marx) cannot refrain from some black panther-esquire comments despite it having no bearing on the story.This is a vehicle for action man Charlton Heston but the action sequences are badly staged, not rising above the level of a TV movie. The finale is also anti-climatically shot and whatever effect the director was trying to achieve is undercut by the odd and inappropriate music.Very dated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'd Rather Amputate a Finger With a Cheese Grater Than Watch This Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading the really good book (I am legend), I was expecting a halfway decent adaptation here.What I got was a mix between "Foxy Brown" and "Dinosaur Island".Heston can't act his way out of a paper bag, and doesn't really try to in this flick. The other actors really didn't help the situation either.The plot stripped the best parts from the book, and all that was left was a big pile of 70's B movie cheese. For example, the "Monsters" sometimes break into jive speak, and the soundtrack sounds like a really bad 70s porno.I want the hour and a half of my life back (I received greater entertainment value from folding socks while watching the movie than I got from the actual movie).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just read the book and this was very disappointing. I would never have chosen Heston (right-winged b******) he's way too old, the younger guy would have done a better job. And other things annoyed, me such as killing the zombie/vampire/hippie with guns, it states clearly in the book, 'a bullet couldn't hurt it, the system could in fact contain almost an indefinite amount of bullets'. so they clearly missed the whole paragraph. Also the problems he is faced with about the garlic, mirrors, Cortman (his friend who became a Vampire and every night stood outside his house shouting his name), the problems he has with sound proofing the house, the temptation of the Vampire women, the drinking problem, finding out how the Vampires survive without his blood for three years, how the crosses only work on Christian vampires and not Muslim LOL. There is so much more i can comment about, in fact i could copy the whole book out for you and you will only find one similarity 'last man on earth'.I recommend reading the book. The character Robert Neville is very interesting you get to know him so well, and he is very amusing at times and others you just want to punch his teeth out. Its the best book i have read in a long time-----------------}'I AM LEGEND' RICHARD MATHESON</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad use of Heston's talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me Charlton Heston is one of the greats. This movie was an embarrassment. It ranks somewhere around plan 9 from outer space. The idea was awful and the movie had poor effects (there was nothing special about the effects). I only watched this because of Heston and I wish I hadn't. I can only imagine what the director and writer were thinking when they were making this film. It is similar to a really poorly made B Horror movie from the same era. I would like to state for the record there are many other great Heston films try Soylent Green or Planet of the Apes which are much better and in the same genre...if you can call the omega man to be in a genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Omega Man is set in Los Angeles in 1977, three years after a gemological war between China &amp; Russia has wiped out the whole human race as we know it apart from Dr. Robert Neville (Charlton Heston) who drives around Los Angeles by day &amp; holds up in his apartment at night as an insane cult of infected albino people in robes that call themselves The family lead by Matthias (Anthony Zerbe) prowl the streets trying to destroy all remaining elements of twentieth century civilization. Neville is looking for a potential cure for the virus that wiped out most of mankind &amp; turned the few survivors into albino nutters who can't look at bright light &amp; is trying to wipe The Family out before they kill him, one day much to his amazement he sees another person, a woman named Lisa (Rosalind Cash) but before he can talk to her he is captured by The Family &amp; put on trial...Directed by Boris Sagal the script by husband &amp; wife team of John William Corrington &amp; Joyce Hooper Corrington was based on the classic 1954 novel I Am Legend by Richard Matheson &amp; is one of several adaptations that include The Last Man on Earth (1964) with Vincent Price &amp; the recent Hollywood blockbuster I Am Legend (2007) with Will Smith. Right off the bat I will openly say I much, much prefer I Am Legend to The Omega Man in just about every aspect, the threat of I Am Legend is more threatening, the menace is more menacing, the plot is far more plausible &amp; makes much more sense &amp; it's a much more believable film. For a start The Omega Man changes the original source novel considerably, in the book Neville faces mutant Vampires while here he comes up against a cult of people who wear cheap looking Halloween costumes complete with 70's over-sized sunglasses who spout lots of new age hippie crap to justify their existence &amp; generally cause trouble. It's never really explained why they just don't break into Neville's home or burn it down or make more of an effort to capture or kill him earlier, I know Matthias doesn't want to use the tools of the twentieth century but he has no problems using guns later in the film, driving cars or firing huge flame-lit arrows from massive crossbows! Likeiwse if Neville's entire existence is devoted to destroying The Family &amp; they end up outside his apartment every night why doesn't he set traps for them or just throw a grenade into the street &amp; blow them up? It's never explained what the The Family are or how they survived the plague or why they are albino or why they can't look at light or even how Lisa &amp; her gang survived either &amp; while in the novel Neville was the last man on Earth here he is not &amp; that black woman Lisa has some of the worst, most dated, unintentionally funny dialogue I have heard in ages, it's a real hoot man! Then there's the bad ending in which Neville becomes some Jesus metaphor as he saves the human race while he bleeds to death in a very obvious crucifix position. In your face hippie &amp; religious symbolism along with an obvious anti racism stance in the same film? Subtle this ain't. Having said all that The Omega Man isn't a total disaster, the opening twenty off minutes as Neville has the entire run of a deserted Los Angeles is effective in creating a sense of isolation, it moves along at a decent pace, there are one or two fun if goofy action set-pieces &amp; some of the dialogue is laugh out loud funny it's dated so badly so while it's watchable I definitely wouldn't call it a classic by any stretch of the imagination.The opening scenes are good except they were shot on weekends when Los Angeles was quiet &amp; you can see other cars &amp; even people walking into shot in the background &amp; by contrast the equivalent opening of I Am Legend with Will Smith in a deserted New York looks a hundred times better &amp; is far more effective. The Family are poor bad guy's &amp; they talk &amp; are basically just normal people, just a little mad &amp; again the mutant zombie menace in I Am Legand is much batter &amp; much scarier which leads to much tenser set-pieces. The film looks horribly dated with huge afro hair do's &amp; some hideous fashion statements going on by the entire cast, just check out Heston's all in one blue skin tight uniform at the end, yikes! There isn't much violence here, there are a few gunshot wounds &amp; a few skeletons lying around but nothing major. There are a few action set-pieces here including a motorbike chase, a car crash &amp; some heroic fight scenes but the stunt doubles are obvious &amp; they are quite poorly edited &amp; feel quite drab unlike the action scenes in I Am Legend which just feel &amp; look much better in both concept &amp; execution on screen.The production values are decent but it does look rather staged at times &amp; the editing isn't the best either. The acting isn't that good, Heston is an uncharismatic hero, Lisa is very unappealing although Anthony Zerbe is quite good &amp; it's a shame he's buried under that terrible make-up job, has ridiculous looking bleached white hair &amp; is stuck behind those 70's shades.The Omega Man isn't the classic I was hoping for, the broad almost meaningless symbolism &amp; the total idiocy of the concept behind The Family means it didn't work for me on the levels it was aiming for although it's not exactly unwatchable. The rip-off merchants The Asylum got in on the act &amp; made I Am Omega (2007) with Mark Dacascos to coincide with the release I Am Legand &amp; it's total tripe.</fullReview>
